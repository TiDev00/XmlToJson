<HEAD>Lab Tries To Explain Why Hazelwood Blood Samples Were Mislabeled</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A laboratory accused of mishandling blood
samples taken from Exxon Valdez skipper Joseph Hazelwood issued a
statement Thursday attempting to explain what happened.
   Lawyers for Hazelwood said the statement left too many questions
unanswered. They continued to assert that the blood testing for
alcohol was botched and followed by a cover-up which denied
Hazelwood his right to a fair trial earlier this year in Alaska in
the nation's worst oil spill.
   Compuchem, the North Carolina parent company of ChemWest, a
Sacramento laboratory that received Hazelwood's blood, acknowledged
that three glass tubes containing his blood were mislabeled by a
lab technician.
   That took place when the tubes were received four days after the
Exxon Valdez struck a reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound in
March 1989, spilling 11 million gallons of crude in the nation's
worst oil spill.
   The lab's finding that Hazelwood's blood had a .06 alcohol
content was the cornerstone of his prosecution on criminal charges.
   Though a jury acquitted him of being intoxicated, the image of
the drunken skipper hung over the proceeding.
   Hazelwood's lawyers contend discrepancies in descriptions of the
tubes in which the blood for Hazelwood's blood was shipped to
California for the alcohol test suggest the lab results could be
for the wrong person.
   Coast Guard technician Scott M. Conner, who drew Hazelwood's
blood 10{ hours after the Exxon Valdez grounding, testified in the
Alaska trial and before the National Transportation Safety Board
that he placed Hazelwood's blood in three 15-milliliter tubes. Two
had gray stoppers and one had a red stopper, he said.
   ChemWest's first inventory sheet showed it had received
Hazelwood's blood in ``three 10 milliliter red stoppered tubes'' on
March 28, 1989.
   The colored stoppers are used to differentiate the contents of
the blood tubes.
   Gray-topped blood tubes contain a chemical added to prevent
blood alcohol from fermenting and thus reaching a reaching a higher
level. Red tubes are used for drug testing and are considered
unreliable for alcohol because they are untreated.
   On Thursday, Compuchem's statement said adhesive evidence tape
obscured a technician's view of the blood tube stoppers.
   ``While the color of the vial stoppers was initially
misidentified because the stoppers were covered by adhesive
evidence tape, this was subsequently discovered and properly
corrected,'' said the lab statement.
   But on May 1, 1989, the inventory sheet appears to have been
changed. the number 3 is crossed out and a 1 is substituted for the
number of red tubes. A hand-written line adds that two
gray-stoppered tubes were received. The size of the tubes is still
logged at 10 milliliters.
   Hazelwood's lawyers were outrage at the lab's explanation about
the tape.
   ``Blood was taken from all of the crew members that day,'' said
attorney Thomas Russo. ``If there were security seals on his tubes
they should have been on all of the tubes. How come they got the
others right? ''
   Identifications on samples of all other crew members conformed
with Conner's testimony, he said.
   ``Why did she say the stoppers were red if she couldn't see
them? did she just make that up?'' Russo asked, referring to
technician Karen S. Metcalf who signed the documents.
   He noted that even after the corrections, ``the sizes of the
tubes were still wrong.''
   Compuchem Vice President Paul Brunswick, whose name appeared on
the statement was unavailable for comment late Thursday. A call to
his North Carolina office after business hours was unanswered.
   ``There was nothing that occurred during the ChemWest handling
and-or testing of the Hazelwood samples that invalidates the chain
of custody or the laboratory testing results,'' said the statement.
   Hazelwood's lawyers complained that the blood documents were
withheld from them until four months after his trial was over,
though they had repeatedly asked to see everything relevant to the
blood tests.
   The lab said the documentation went to ``authorized officials''
and to the National Transportation Safety Board when the trial
began in February.
   ``There are strict legal limitations regarding the release of
such information to others,'' it added. ``These precautions are
necessary to protect individual rights and confidentiality.''
   Hazelwood lawyer Michael Chalos had a different interpretation
of the withholding of documents.
   ``What they did was deprive Capt. Hazelwood of his rights,''
Chalos said.
   He alleged that the NTSB, the Coast Guard and the State of
Alaska also may have had the documents and withheld them.
   ``ChemWest handled the receipt, testing and reporting of the
Hazelwood samples correctly and totally in compliance with
established forensic drug testing procedures,'' said the statement
issued for Compuchem by a New York public relations firm.
   The NTSB is scheduled to issue its final report on the Exxon
Valdez disaster next Tuesday. Russo and Chalos have said the newly
discovered documents should be taken into account if the board is
planning to say whether Hazelwood was intoxicated.
   A Coast Guard administrative law judge suspended Hazelwood's
captain's license for nine months in a plea bargain announced
Wednesday. The Coast Guard dropped two charges including one that
he was intoxicated, and Hazelwood pleaded no contest to two other
charges including one that he drank alcohol within four hours of
sailing.

<HEAD>Animal Rights Activists Monitor Annual Pony Swim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHINCOTEAGUE, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Animal rights activists kept watch
Wednesday as about 150 wild ponies made the 65th annual Chicoteague
Island pony swim.
   A crowd of about 40,000 people, including the activists, saw the
ponies complete a 10 to 15 minute swim across the quarter-mile-wide
channel to this barrier island from Assateague.
   Bonnie Scribner of Voice for Animals, a Charlottesville-based
group, said after the watching the swim that she ``had seen nothing
amiss.''
   ``But the swim is just part of it,'' she said. ``We don't
approve of the sale of foals under four months of age.
   She said last year there was no veterinarian available and two
ponies died. Her organization came to make sure a veterinarian was
present. There were two on duty and Ms. Scribner said she was
delighted.
   The animals are thought to be the descendants of ponies who
washed ashore during Colonial times from shipwrecks. The ponies
gained fame from Marguerite Henry's children's classic ``Misty of
Chincoteague,'' first published in 1947.
   Activists had said they wanted to monitor the 65th roundup,
penning and auction of the wild horses by the community's volunteer
fire department.
   Gail Eisnitz of the Humane Society of the United States said the
event is ``real stressful for the horses and ponies. We feel it is
animal exploitation for human entertainment and for big bucks.''
   Some of the foals will be sold at auction Thursday by the fire
department to control the herd size. Last year, the department made
$40,000 on the sale of 77 foals.
   Ed Moran, president of the Chincoteague volunteer fire
department, said all the money raised, including that from a $25
video of the swim, goes ``back into the community.'' He said it
pays for maintaining the departments three fire trucks and four
ambulances.
   About 20 to 25 people wilted in the midday heat and were taken
by ambulance for treatment at the Island Medical Center, then
released, said ambulance chairman Ollie Reed.
   The Humane Society of the United States has been monitoring the
annual event for 20 years.
   Ms. Eisnitz said conditions for the animals have improved. But
in the last two years, six animals have died.
   As a result of those deaths, the Chincoteague National Wildlife
Refuge on Assateague threatened to revoke the fire department's
permit to graze the animals on the refuge if the department did not
provide a veterinarian for the swim, penning and auction.

<TEXT>
   A man accused of hijacking two city buses from
depots early Wednesday told detectives he wanted to work for the
Transit Authority, police sources said.
   The first bus was grabbed in Manhattan and driven 25 miles
across the borough of Queens. But it wasn't until the second bus
was spotted zooming out of the Queens depot at 4:45 a.m. that the
double theft was discovered.
   A sharp-eyed transit manager later spotted the second bus coming
off the Triborough Bridge in Manhattan, recognized that it was in
the wrong borough and started a chase that resulted in the
suspect's capture.
   Darius McCollum, 25, of Queens, was charged with grand larceny
after his arrest at Grand Central station at about 6 a.m., said
police spokesman Officer Scott Block.
   Police sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said
McCollum told detectives he stole the buses because the Transit
Authority wouldn't hire him.
   Investigators were checking Transit Authority records to see
whether McCollum had applied for a job or taken a test to become a
bus driver.
   Detectives were also trying to verify McCollum's boasts that he
had commandeered a subway train about 10 years ago, as a teenager.
   Twenty-five city buses have been stolen in the last 12 months,
according to Transit Authority statistics. ``Unfortunately, it's
going up. We are seeing a trend,'' said Transit Authority
spokeswoman Caren Gardner.
   McCollum is considered a suspect in other bus thefts, said
Transit Police spokesman Al O'Leary.
   ``What someone wants to do with a Transit Authority bus, I can't
begin to tell you,'' Ms. Gardner said. The bright blue and silver
buses, which are 40 feet long by nine feet wide ``are kind of
recognizable and not usually taken for joyrides.''
   The manager who spotted the bus at 5:30 a.m. waved down a police
car and officers gave chase.
   The driver jumped from the moving bus in front of Grand Central,
and the bus rolled into a parked New York Telephone truck, causing
no damage to either vehicle, Ms. Gardner said.
   McCollum was arrested inside Grand Central.

   Americans say Pete Rose deserves a place in two
venerable institutions: the federal prison system and the Baseball
Hall of Fame.
   Eighty-one percent in a national Associated Press poll said it
was right for Rose, baseball's all-time hit leader, to be sentenced
to federal prison last week. He got a five-month term last week for
cheating on his taxes.
   At the same time, a majority said Rose should be allowed to work
in baseball again, even though he was banished from the sport for
gambling last year. And two-thirds said he deserved election to the
Hall of Fame.
   Most respondents also said Rose's problems did little to damage
his sport. Fifty-six percent said he had not hurt baseball's image,
and among those who said he had done damage, only about a third
said it was serious.
   Rose, 49, ex-manager of the Cincinnati Reds, can apply for
reinstatement to baseball, and 63 percent said he should get it at
some point.
   Rose becomes eligible in December 1991 for election by sports
writers to the Hall of Fame. With 4,256 hits in a 24-year career,
he was virtually assured of the honor before he ran afoul of the
baseball commissioner and the law. His chances now are less certain.
   The poll did not specify an election date for Rose, asking only
if he should be named to the Hall of Fame ``at some point.''
Baseball fans were a bit more likely than non-fans to favor him for
the hall, 71 to 63 percent, and men were more supportive than
women, 74 to 62 percent.
   Women also were slightly more likely than men to say Rose had
damaged baseball's image, 43 to 36 percent. But men were a bit
harder on Rose in other areas: They were more likely than women to
say he deserved jail time, 85-78 percent. And while 67 percent of
women said Rose should be allowed back into baseball at some point,
that fell to 59 percent of men.
   In most cases, opinion was roughly the same among respondents
who called themselves baseball fans as among non-fans. Fifty-four
percent said they were fans _ 61 percent of the men and 48 percent
of the women.
   The telephone survey of 1,004 adults was conducted for the AP
from Friday through Tuesday by ICR Survey Research Group of Media,
Pa., part of AUS Consultant Cos. The poll has a margin of error of
plus or minus three percentage points.

   This Associated Press poll was conducted by
telephone July 20-24 among a random sample of 1,004 adults in the
continental United States. Interviewing was done by ICR Survey
Research Group of Media, Pa.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that 19 of
20 times its findings should be within 3 points of the result if
every adult American were asked the same questions. The error
margin is larger for subgroups.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this
poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. Pete Rose has been sentenced to five months in prison and
fined for cheating on his taxes by failing to report about $350,000
in income. Do you think it was right for Pete Rose to get jail
time, or not? Yes: 81 percent. No: 13 percent. Don't know or no
answer: 6 percent.
   2. Pete Rose was banned from baseball last year for his
involvement with gamblers. Do you think that ban should be
lifelong, or should he be allowed to work in baseball again at some
point? Lifelong: 28. Work again: 63. DK-NA: 9.
   3. Though he's been banned from baseball for gambling and
convicted of a tax felony, as a player Pete Rose had the most base
hits of any ballplayer ever. Do you think he should be elected to
baseball's Hall of Fame at some point, or not? Yes: 67. No: 25.
DK-NA: 8.
   4a. Do you think Pete Rose has hurt baseball's image, or not?
Yes: 39. No: 56. DK-NA: 5.
   4b. (If yes) Would you say he's hurt it seriously, or not too
seriously? Seriously: 14. Not too seriously: 25. DK-NA: 1.
   5. Do you consider yourself to be a baseball fan, or not? Yes:
54. No: 45. DK-NA: 1.

<TEXT>
   Israel has ordered its state-owned El Al
airline to halt its twice-weekly flights to Stockholm in response
to changes in Sweden's airport security arrangements.
   ``The new security procedures made by the government of Sweden
do not answer the security requirements of the government of
Israel,'' Yehiel Amitai, spokesman for the Ministry of
Transportation, said Wednesday.
   He would not say what changes had been made but said his
ministry could not allow the continuation of El Al flights that
were not ``adequately guarded.'' Amitai said the decision would be
reversed if Sweden returned to the previous security arrangements.
   The Transportation Ministry, citing the principle of mutuality,
also banned all charter flights originating in Sweden from landing
in Israel. The Scandinavian carrier SAS does not operate regular
flights from Stockholm to Israel.
   El Al has canceled its flights in the past over security
arrangements. Usually it involves the presence of Israeli security
people who want direct responsibility for the safety of the
aircraft and passengers, something not every country is willing to
allow.
   El Al flights are considered prime targets for Palestinian
guerrillas, and security is very stringent.
   In December 1985, guerrillas of the radical Abu Nidal
Organization launched attacks against the El Al counters in the
Rome and Vienna airports, killing 16 people.

<HEAD>American Animal Rights Activist Posts `Theses' At Vatican</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American animal rights activist posted a
petition in St. Peter's Square calling on Pope John Paul II to
declare that animals have immortal souls, and sought a meeting with
the pontiff.
   But security guards quickly took down the statement on Wednesday
and shooed away the activist, John Stockwell of Berkeley, Calif.,
and several of his followers. And a private audience was not
granted.
   Stockwell, a 55-year-old geologist and school teacher, compared
his initiative to that of Martin Luther, the Protestant Reformation
leader who posted his historic 95 theses on the door of a castle
church in Wittenberg, Germany, in 1517.
   ``What we're seeking is the beginning of a humane and ecological
reformation,'' Stockwell said.
   He said he had hoped for a meeting with the pope but was not
granted one. Stockwell and several followers attended the pope's
general audience Wednesday morning but they were given seats far
from the pontiff.
   Later, the group gathered in St. Peter's Square and Stockwell
taped a sheet of paper containing his 10 ``theses'' to the base of
a marble column near the entrance to the basilica.
   After photographers snapped pictures, Vatican guards moved in,
removed the petition and asked the group to leave the area.
   Stockwell applauded a recent statement by the pope that God's
breath also touched animals, but said he wanted John Paul to go
further.
   His petition declares that all animal species have immortal
souls. It also calls for a ban on hunting, fishing, medical and
scientific research on animals and all forms of abuse and cruelty.
   In an address to scientists in 1982, the pope said, ``It is
certain that animals are at the service of man and can hence be the
object of experimentation. Nevertheless, they must be treated as
creatures of God which are destined to serve man's good, but not to
be abused by him.''

   Plainclothes officers spent two weeks cycling the streets and

<TEXT>
   An Israeli Arab poet has pleaded innocent to
charges he incited anti-Israeli violence with his writings.
   At the opening day of his trial Wednesday, Shafik Habib, a
49-year-old accountant from Nazareth, acknowledged he had written
the book of poetry on which the charges are based.
   But he denied that his ``political poetry'' constituted
incitement.
   Habib was jailed and then held under house arrest for several
weeks in June after police charged that his poems could incite
violence. The military censor banned further publication of the
poems.
   The action was taken under an anti-terror statute that dates
back to the days of British control.
   The arrest ignited protests by Arab legislators and Arab
writers' unions. They said they feared the move could signal a
government crackdown on writers and other artists.
   The court in this northern port city was told Wednesday that
Habib's poetry urged violence against Jews and supported the
31-month Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The charges say Habib's poetry encourages readers to fight back
with stones, Molotov cocktails and explosives.
   Judge Rahamin Tsemah agreed to delay further proceedings until
Sept. 30 after Habib complained that the translation of his book
from Arabic to Hebrew was not precise.

   Guerrillas fired two rocket-propelled grenades
at the presidential palace late Wednesday, less than three days
before President-elect Alberto Fujimori is to take office. Police
said damage to the palace in downtown Lima was minor.
   The attack took place just after outgoing President Alan Garcia
met with a group of judges to sign a law reforming Peru's
judiciary, police and witnesses said.
   One grenade exploded against the rear wall of the building and
the other exploded on the roof.
   The grenades were launched by two men from next to a small car
parked 100 yards from the palace's rear entry. The men then fled in
the car, police said.
   Afterwards, in comments to reporters, Garcia discounted the
importance of the attack.
   ``All they prove with their pistols and bombs is that they're
psychologically inferior. They have to resort to violence because
they cannot convince people through politics,'' he said.
   Police set up roadblocks throughout downtown Lima and detained
hundreds of people. They said they were unsure which of Peru's two
rebel groups staged the attack _ the Maoist Shining Path or the
pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru.
   In other attacks late Wednesday, Shining Path rebels burned a
city-owned bus in a poor Lima neighborhood. In another poor area of
the capital, rebels from the same group bombed a telephone
exchange, causing moderate damage.
   The Shining Path has conducted a violent campaign against Peru's
government throughout the last decade.

   Here is the text of the letter written by
David H. Souter on behalf of the judges of the New Hampshire
Superior Court on May 13, 1981 to Roma H. Spaulding, chairwoman of
the Health and Welfare Committee of the New Hampshire House.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Dear Madame Chairman:
   I am writing as a member of the committee to speak for the
Superior Court on proposed legislation that would affect the court.
The full court met on May 7 and directed me to write to you to
express the court's position on SB 194, which you have scheduled
for hearing on May 13.
   The judges do not believe it is appropriate for the court to
take a position on the basic question addressed by the bill,
whether parental consent should be required before an abortion may
be performed upon an unmarried minor. The court's concern is
directed, rather, to that provision of the bill that would require
a justice of the Superior Court to authorize the performance of an
abortion upon such a minor when there is no parental consent, if
the justice determines ``that the performance of an abortion would
be in ... the (best) interests'' of a minor who is ``not mature.''
   The members of the court find two fundamental problems inherent
in this provision. First, it would express a decision by society,
speaking through the Legislature, to leave it to individual
justices of this court to make fundamental moral decisions about
the interests of other people without any standards to guide the
individual judge. Judges are professionally qualified to apply
rules and stated norms, but the provision in question would enact
no rule to be applied and would express no norm. In place of a rule
or a norm there would be left only the individual judge's
principles and predilections. As carefully considered as these
might be, they would still be those of only one individual, not
those of society. Much criticism of the role of the judiciary in
this country has characterized judicial activity in the application
of constitutional standards as no more than the imposition of
individual judges' views in the guise of applying constitutional
norms of great generality. The provision that I have quoted from
the present bill would force the Superior Court to engage in just
such acts of unfettered personal choice.
   The court's second concern is with the necessarily moral
character of such choice and the resulting disparity of responses
to requests that judicial discretion be exercised. As you would
expect, there are some judges who believe abortion under the
circumstances contemplated by the bill is morally wrong, who could
not in conscience issue an order requiring an abortion to be
performed. There are others who believe that what may be thought to
be in the ``best interests'' of the pregnant minor is itself just
as necessarily a moral as a social question, upon which a judge may
not morally speak for another human being, whatever may be that
judge's own personal opinion about the morality of abortion. Judges
in each category would be obligated to indicate that they could not
exercise their power in favor of authorizing abortions to be
performed on immature pregnant minors. The inevitable result would
be required shopping for judges who would entertain such cases. In
other words, a principled and consistent application of the quoted
provision would be impossible.
   For these reasons I have been directed to request on behalf of
the court that any bill you may pass on this subject not authorize
the exercise of judicial choice by justices of the Superior Court
to determine whether an abortion should be performed upon a
pregnant, immature minor whose parents do not consent to that
course of action.
   Yours respectfully,
   David H. Souter, Justice
   New Hampshire Superior Court

   Reps. Ronald Machtley and James McClure Clarke
have a message for the budget negotiators who are thinking of
cutting Social Security and Medicare.
   Don't.
   ``That's the poison pill for any solution,'' said Machtley,
R-R.I.
   ``Social Security would be awful,'' said Clarke, D-N.C.
``Medicare should be only a last resort.''
   Machtley and Clarke both represent districts with large numbers
of retired people and both expect tight re-election races this fall.
   But their reluctance to slash Social Security and Medicare is
shared by most members of Congress. That's why budget bargainers,
who are likely to cut programs that help the elderly, are exploring
those reductions with all the trepidation of kids tiptoeing into an
isolated, dark cave.
   ``F-16s (fighter planes) don't vote, senior citizens do,'' said
House Majority Whip William Gray, D-Pa., referring to the
Democratic preference to cut deeply into the defense budget.
``That's a political reality of an election year.''
   Negotiators from the White House and Congress have been trying
for 11 weeks to reduce the federal budget deficit by increasing
taxes and trimming programs. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said Wednesday that the two sides had agreed to present specific
proposals as early as week's end.
   The talks are being watched closely by senior citizens'
organizations. Those groups have warned the negotiators to leave
Social Security alone and go after Medicare only as part of a
package in which all groups _ not just the elderly _ bear some pain.
   ``It would be very tough to argue to the people affected by
these cuts that it's a fair sacrifice for them if they look around
and see other people not suffering with the same intensity,'' said
lobbyist John Rother of the 32-million-member American Association
of Retired Persons.
   Members of both parties involved in the budget talks say it now
appears unlikely that Social Security benefits will be cut.
   ``Social Security has been described as the third rail of
American politics. If you touch it, you die,'' said Rep. Bill
Frenzel, R-Minn., a negotiator who favors restraining the program's
growth.
   But the Bush administration supports some cuts in the program _
which helps support 39 million elderly and disabled people and
their dependents _ and the issue isn't completely off the
bargaining table.
   Medicare, which provides health coverage for 33 million elderly
and disabled Americans, appears targeted for at least $3 billion in
reduced payments to doctors and hospitals.
   The reason Social Security and Medicare are vulnerable boils
down to arithmetic.
   Budget negotiators are trying to reduce next year's projected
$169 billion deficit by at least $50 billion. That's a lot of
money, even for a $1.2 trillion budget, so the bargainers are
looking for big targets.
   They've found them in Social Security and Medicare. Social
Security is the biggest federal benefit program and will cost $245
billion this year. Medicare will have a $97 billion price tag.
   Together, they account for more than one dollar of every four
the government will spend in 1990.
   As the country's population ages _ and medical costs soar _
these programs are expected to grow even more. The non-partisan
Congressional Budget Office projects that by 1995, Social Security
will cost $338 billion and Medicare will cost $183 billion.
   ``They can at least arguably stand a reduction,'' said Frenzel,
who is retiring from Congress.
   These programs are even more vulnerable because by some
measures, the nation's elderly are a relatively well-off group.
Advocates for the elderly dispute those measures, contending that
large numbers of senior citizens live below the poverty line.
   ``That's the wrong group of people being asked to sacrifice,''
said AARP's Rother.
   Senior citizens groups are already gearing up for a fight,
sending letters and serving notice to lawmakers that millions of
voters know what is going on. Their campaign is aimed at a Congress
that vividly recalls the Democrats' 1986 recapture of the Senate,
which many credit to the Republicans' willingness to cut Social
Security.
   ``This can be political dynamite,'' said Sen. Don Nickles of
Oklahoma, who heads the Senate GOP's election committee.

   It's an argument among statisticians,
economists and intelligence analysts, matching eye-glazing formulas
and rival numbers that measure the magnitude of Soviet military
spending _ with a very big price tag behind the debate.
   Central Intelligence Agency estimates of the Soviet economy, its
performance and the share Moscow was spending on the military have
been a factor in U.S. defense planning and budgeting for the past
40 years.
   Now the CIA numbers are being challenged.
   A Democratic senator says Soviet economic strength has been
vastly overestimated for years, prompting an American military
buildup that helped run the United States deep into debt.
   A top economic adviser to President Bush said he thinks the
Soviet gross national product last year was substantially lower
than the CIA estimated.
   Soviet economists, free to speak after decades of Cold War
silence on such topics, say their nation's economic performance was
far weaker than the CIA judged it to be.
   And an analyst at the Defense Intelligence Agency said at a
Senate hearing that the CIA ``clearly understates'' the share of
the Soviet economy devoted to military expenditures.
   William T. Lee, a longtime CIA critic, said that agency's
methods are flawed and ``likely to be as unreliable, and
misleading, in the future as in the past.''
   But the CIA insists that essentially, it has been correct.
   ``I think we have done a very good job on a very complex
issue,'' George Kolt, CIA director of Soviet analysis, said last
week at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. ``But that
does not mean that our numbers are totally accurate. They are
estimates that are most likely on the high side.''
   The current CIA estimate is that the Soviet gross national
product amounts to 51 percent of that in the United States, which
had a 1989 GNP of $4.2 trillion.
   Michael J. Boskin, chairman of Bush's Council of Economic
Advisers, said he thinks the Soviet GNP is about one-third that of
the United States.
   At a conference sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute
in April, Soviet economists and statisticians offered even lower
estimates. One Soviet official, Victor Belkin, said his nation's
GNP could be as low as 14 percent of that in the United States, and
no higher than 28 percent.
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., says the CIA estimates of
Soviet economic strength and military capabilities in the mid-1970s
led to the massive defense buildup that began when Jimmy Carter was
president and accelerated under Ronald Reagan.
   Moynihan said the Senate committee should look further into the
consequences of government statistics about the Soviet Union.
   ``Would we have spent as much on our military during the 1980s
if we had believed that the Soviet defense burden simply was not
sustainable?'' he asked. ``I think not, and if I am correct, then
this issue has been a momentous one for the state of the American
economy.''
   Moynihan said that just as the United States was launching its
military buildup, ``Soviet economists were predicting disaster for
their economy.''
   The CIA's Kolt said that while the agency considers its estimate
of the defense burden generally accurate, the threat to the United
States isn't represented by that number anyhow, but by Soviet
weapons and forces.
   And those are easier to count than economic statistics.
   Defense spending accounts for about 6 percent of the U.S. gross
national product. Kolt said the CIA had estimated that 15 to 17
percent of the Soviet gross national product has been going into
military spending, although that has declined since last year.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said he thinks it is running at
about 25 percent but doubts it will stay that high.
   ``Soviet military spending will decline as a matter of policy,
and because it can't be sustained,'' he said. ``... I think they
are in a depression.''
   Nevertheless, Cheney said, the Soviet military is maintaining
and modernizing its strategic forces. ``That's what makes them a
superpower and they won't give that up,'' he said.

<HEAD>Thailand-Vietnam Rice Fight Cutting U.S. Export Prospects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A trade spat between two big Southeast Asia
rice producers is helping dampen export prospects for U.S. rice
farmers.
   But an Agriculture Department report says ``tight supplies are
likely to keep U.S. prices firm'' in the coming year, at least
above sagging world prices.
   ``Over the last year, world prices have weakened in response to
increased competition in world markets, especially between Thailand
and Vietnam, and a drop in world trade,'' the report said Wednesday.
   The export competition is expected to heat up further in the
1990-91 rice marketing year that begins Aug. 1.
   Currently, the report said, Vietnam has cut into Thailand's
markets by selling at ``prices substantially below'' those offered
by Thai exporters. Thailand is the world's largest rice exporter.
   ``Recently, Thailand announced an export subsidy scheme in an
effort to increase exports, but the response has been weak,'' the
report said.
   Meanwhile, Thailand's market share dropped from 40 percent in
1989 to 31 percent forecast for 1990.
   ``It is expected that Thailand will aggressively compete with
Vietnam to regain market share in 1991,'' the report said.
   The U.S. global market share is forecast to fall to about 18
percent in 1991 from 20 percent the past two years. USDA analysts
said tight supplies and relatively high prices ``may hinder U.S.
competitiveness'' in some foreign markets.
   Analysts said U.S. rice production this year may be about 158
million hundredweight, up only 2.3 percent from the 1989 harvest,
based on acreage and yield-trend projections. The first official
rice estimate will be included in USDA's Aug. 9 crop report.
   ``However, conditions to date indicate that yields may not match
last year's record,'' the report said. ``Rain and wet field
conditions this spring delayed planting in the Mississippi Delta,
which could reduce yield potential.''
   Currently, based on the latest projections, the U.S. rice
stockpile going into the new marketing year on Aug. 1 is expected
to be 23.8 million hundredweight, down from 26.7 million a year ago
and 31.4 million two years ago.
   If production and total use turns out as projected, the rice
stockpile a year from now could be about unchanged from the current
level, the report said.

   A report to Congress says the Agriculture
Department should review more closely a proposal to remove import
inspections on Canadian meat and poultry entering the United States.
   The proposal was announced by USDA last month, with July 30 set
as a deadline for public comments. If adopted, the experimental
plan would be in effect for one year.
   Officials of the department's Food Safety and Inspection Service
said Canadian products would still be thoroughly inspected at
slaughter and processing plants under ``a system that is nearly
identical'' to the U.S. system and standards.
   But re-inspection of random samples at border points would be
eliminated under the proposal. A reciprocal nod would be given U.S.
products entering Canada.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, said in a recent report that the department's inspection
agency has not documented how it arrived at the determination that
Canada's system is virtually identical to that of the United States.
   Further, the GAO said, ``unexplained 1989 rejection rates'' for
Canadian meat inspected randomly at border points are cause for
concern.
   According to the report, USDA inspectors rejected about 3
percent of the selected products, compared with 1 percent in 1988.
   ``Without an adequate explanation, the rates could be
interpreted as indicating a decline during 1989 in the
effectiveness of the Canadian inspection system,'' the report said.
   Assistant Agriculture Secretary Jo Ann Smith told a Senate
hearing on July 12 that the meat proposal is a spinoff from the
U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement that went into effect Jan. 1,
1989. The goal, she reminded lawmakers, is to promote economic
growth in both countries.
   Smith said some U.S. producers and manufacturers are worried
that Canada will intrude on the American market.
   ``But as with any trade agreement, it's a two-way street,'' she
said. ``We will see Canadian products move to the United States,
just as we will increasingly market and sell U.S. products to
Canadian consumers.''
   The industry's American Meat Institute told the same Senate
panel that the open-border proposal ``deserves a fair chance to
work.''
   Michael J. Copps, the trade association's senior vice president
for legislative affairs, said the one-year experiment is a
``necessary and logical step to eliminate trade barriers'' between
the two countries.

   A South African cousin of kleingrass, which is
popular in areas of scant rainfall, may some day be added to the
list of U.S. forage crops, the Agriculture Department says.
   The regular kleingrass is liked because of its ability to thrive
in inhospitable settings with little water, the department's
Agricultural Research Service said Wednesday in a report.
   But kleingrass has a major drawback for seed producers: a
tendency to shatter when harvested, dumping its seed on the ground
almost as fast as it ripens. Scientists estimate only 10 percent of
the seed is actually harvested.
   The South African kleingrass, however, retains about twice as
much of its seed. The new line was discovered in 1976 and is being
evaluated by scientists, the agency said.

   For nearly a decade, Ramon Gonzalez Vergara
dreamed of leaving Cuba for a better life, but he was afraid to
defect on his travels abroad for fear his family would be punished
by the Castro government.
   Finally, Vergara told a news conference Wednesday, he received
his ``lucky break'' when he was assigned to Moscow as Cuba's deputy
secretary at the Council on Mutual Economic Assistance, the Soviet
bloc's economic confederation.
   Vergara, 50, an economist, took his wife, his mother-in-law and
his two children, ages 14 and 11, on his foreign posting.
   While in Moscow, Vergara and his wife plotted how they would
leave the Soviet Union but didn't tell their children about their
plan, he said in his first public appearance in this country.
   Because it was too dangerous to talk aloud in their Moscow
apartment _ Vergara feared electronic eavesdropping _ he and his
wife communicated using chalk on a blackboard.
   He said they walked in the park when they wanted to iron out
their plans.
   Finally, on June 25, the Vergara acted on their plan. The family
went to Berlin for a holiday and then crossed the border in a
Soviet-made Lada vehicle.
   The car worked well, Vergara said, joking that the Soviets ought
to be proud of their vehicles.
   ``We knew we only had a 72-hour grace period,'' Vergara said.
The family drove quickly across the continent to Madrid where they
had relatives. In Spain, Vergara sought asylum at the U.S. Embassy.
   Vergara, whose appearance was sponsored by the Cuban-American
National Foundation, is one of the growing number of Cubans who are
carrying out plans to leave, said Jackie Tillman, who works with
the anti-Castro group.
   In his remarks, Vergara said the Soviet Union could not sustain
the huge amounts of aid that have propped up the Cuban economy.
   ``The Soviet aid helps a lot to maintain the standard of
living'' in Cuba, he said. U.S. officials estimate the Soviet
Union's grants and subsidies to Cuba amount to $5 billion annually,
but some private economists say that figure may be high.
   Vergara confirmed the $5 billion amount, but he said he doubted
it would continue at a time of belt-tightening and shortages in the
Soviet Union itself.
   ``They can't maintain the same levels of past year,'' he said.
``Of course, the Cuban government is aware of the situation; they
have felt the first symptoms.'
   Vergara, who described Cuba's economy as being in recession,
said Havana's trade with the Soviet Union amounts to 75 percent of
the total. Trade with former Soviet satellites such as those in
Eastern Europe amounted to between 12 percent and 17 percent of the
total, he said.
   While trade with Eastern Europe has eroded in recent months,
Cuba is reaching out to trading partners in Latin America and
China, he said.

   Bob Zuckerman came to rub shoulders with the
pros and Selma Ford arrived harboring hopes for a job back home in
Ohio.
   One hundred political enthusiasts converged on Washington
Wednesday for the kickoff of the Democrats' annual campaign summer
camp.
   The intense, five-day training seminar is designed to teach
would-be political pros the imprecise art of the campaign _
everything from how to control unpredictable candidates to how to
curry favorable press coverage.
   Participants will plunge themselves into a campaign between mock
state senate candidates Ann Neu Age and Bob ``Sonny'' Legion,
working from candidate profiles, financial background and polling
data.
   Once the race is on, a local newspaper, the Daily Plan-It,
covers the changes in the political climate and keeps the campaigns
informed of the candidates' sometimes unpredictable behavior.
   The training camp was started in 1985 with the aim of electing
Democrats to state legislatures in key states before the 1990
census. This year's crop of campers includes seasoned campaigners
and novices alike.
   Zuckerman, a New Jersey state Senate aide who has worked in
several state-level campaigns, said he hopes to make new contacts
and polish his campaign skills _ learning from ``political
professionals here who have years and years of experience.''
   Ford, a student who just finished a Washington internship, hopes
to translate her training into a job on the gubernatorial campaign
of Democrat Anthony Celebrezze in her home state of Ohio.
   ``It's wonderful experience _ and I want him to win,'' she said.
   Democratic Party Chairman Ronald Brown opened camp with a pep
talk, telling participants the key to Democratic gains over the
next decade lies in the success of statehouse races this year.
   Those elections are crucial to both parties, since each side
wants to have the upper hand when states redraw congressional and
legislative districts based on the 1990 census results.
   ``The only way to ensure fairness in reapportionment is to make
sure that the hand that draws the lines is the hand of a
Democrat,'' Brown said.
   After the opening ceremonies in Washington, participants went to
rural Piney Point, Md., for the remainder of the training camp.

   Granting temporary amnesty to tax evaders in
order to reduce the budget deficit could make honest taxpayers feel
cheated and lose more money than it gains, the Bush administration
says.
   ``A federal tax amnesty program ... is a gamble with our tax
system's most important asset _ the general willingness of
taxpayers to obey the law,'' said Michael J. Graetz, deputy
assistant secretary of the treasury for tax policy.
   The vast majority of taxpayers, who already comply with tax
laws, might feel cheated if they see that those who knowingly broke
the rules are allowed to escape punishment, Graetz told the House
Government Operations subcommittee on consumer affairs Wednesday.
   Tax amnesty is a popular proposal in Congress as lawmakers look
for ways to reduce the budget deficit without raising taxes or
cutting spending too deeply.
   The Internal Revenue Service estimates that cheating on income
taxes will cost $87 billion in lost revenue this year. In addition,
the long-term backlog of taxes that corporations and individuals
admit owing but have not paid will total in the $80 billion range
this year.
   Several bills would give wayward taxpayers six months in which
to settle their accounts with the IRS. In return, the agency would
waive penalties _ and, under some bills, forgive interest _ and
forgo civil or criminal prosecution.
   The bills also promise considerably toughened enforcement after
amnesty ends and include an expanded auditing and collection force
at the IRS.
   ``As we battle headlong to reduce our uncontrollable budget
deficit, debating over whether to cut essential programs or impose
unwanted taxes on our citizens, we should take advantage of the
benefits that a tax amnesty program yields,'' Sen. Alan Dixon,
D-Ill., sponsor of one amnesty bill, told the subcommittee.
   Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., noted that the 1991 budget prepared by
the Senate Budget Committee endorses the amnesty program he has
proposed, which congressional authorities estimate would bring in
an extra $63.7 billion over five years.
   ``It's both fiscally irresponsible and insulting to the vast
majority of honest taxpayers in this country if we fail to tap this
revenue from those who haven't complied,'' Conrad told the
subcommittee.
   Graetz, the Treasury official, called Conrad's estimate an
exaggeration. ``We do not believe a federal amnesty program would
raise large additional revenues, and there is a risk that such a
program, in fact, might lose revenue,'' he said.
   IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr. also said ``a general
federal tax amnesty would be ill-advised and counterproductive.''
Even so, he said, the IRS is studying results from the 31 states
that have offered amnesty and considering proposals that ``might be
designed to provide an opportunity for a fresh start to those
individuals who are not reached by our current tax administration
efforts.''
   State amnesties have produced $1.6 billion in gross revenues,
but Graetz and Goldberg said there is no reason to expect a federal
amnesty would bring in large amounts.
   Federal enforcement efforts already are far more effective than
those used by any state, Graetz said. In addition, a considerable
part of the increased state revenues probably were attributable to
the tougher enforcement that accompanied amnesty, he said.
   Goldberg said any workable amnesty would have to be highly
targeted and part of a massive program to update IRS computers and
tighten enforcement. There should be no forgiveness of interest or
amnesty in tax-shelter cases, he said.
   Under the best of circumstances, Goldberg said, there are
serious doubts that the IRS could implement any amnesty program
during the next several years.

   Supporters of guaranteed unpaid family leave
for workers say Congress will keep sending a bill to President Bush
until he signs it or they gain enough votes to override his veto.
   ``George Bush is going to have a family leave bill on his desk
every year he is in office,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.
   Backers fell 53 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed in
the House to override on Wednesday, sustaining Bush's veto of a
family leave bill with a 232-195 vote.
   ``We're going to have this kind of legislation enacted, if not
this year in this session, next year or the year after,'' said
House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash. ``It's inevitable.''
   Fifty-seven Democrats voted with Bush to sustain the veto, along
with 138 Republicans. Voting to override were 194 Democrats and 38
Republicans.
   The vote kept Bush's perfect veto record intact. It was the 13th
veto of Bush's presidency, and Congress has failed to override any.
   Democrats, and some Republicans, denounced Bush's veto and said
it would provide Democrats with an issue in the fall elections.
They pointed to polls that show large majorities of the public
support the idea.
   The bill would have required employers _ except those with fewer
than 50 workers _ to provide unpaid, job-protected leave of up to
12 weeks to workers who have new babies or family illness or other
emergencies. Those in the highest-paid 10 percent within a company
would have been exempt.
   Employers would have been required to continue health insurance
benefits for those on leave. Once the employees returned, they
would have to be restored to their previous jobs or equivalent
positions.
   Opponents charged the bill would be an onerous and costly new
burden for businesses and hurt workers by discouraging employers
from offering other types of benefits.
   Rep. Steve Bartlett, R-Texas, praised Bush for his ``courageous
veto'' and charged the bill would have imposed a
``one-size-fits-all benefit'' without regard to need.
   Dodd, who guided the bill through the Senate, said he would
introduce a new version in that chamber next week. He said it would
have only minor differences and acknowledged it may be difficult to
push the issue again in this session.
   Foley said Democrats would not try to push a milder version of
the bill this year. He said the vetoed measure was a moderate bill,
requiring only unpaid leave, and that most industrialized nations
have programs that meet or exceed it.
   ``Further adjustment to satisfy the president, I think, would
have to reduce the bill to a nullity, and I for one am not willing
to do that,'' Foley said.
   Business groups had strongly opposed the measure. Though
confident of victory, more than 50 lobbyists from a coalition of
business groups worked Capitol Hill sporting buttons that said
``Sustain the Veto.''
   Democrats pointed to Bush's own campaign rhetoric in his 1988
presidential campaign, in which he said he supported the idea of
unpaid family leaves. Some Republicans criticized the president too.
   ``Where's our heart?'' asked Rep. Arthur Ravenel, R-S.C.

   Senate committee leaders aren't giving up
campaign donations from groups affected by the panels' decisions,
although some senators are shedding contributions from savings and
loan interests.
   A spot check of various committee chairmen and ranking minority
members turned up none willing to follow the lead of the Banking
Committee's Donald Riegle, who says he no longer will accept
campaign money from interest groups under his panel's jurisdiction.
   ``My inclination is to believe it's an isolated incident from
someone who's under the gun,'' said Michael Traugott, a University
of Michigan political scientist and authority on campaign finance.
``I would put it under the heading of damage control.''
   Riegle is among five senators whose ties to Charles Keating Jr.
and his failed Lincoln Savings and Loan are the subject of an
ethics committee investigation.
   ``Riegle's been under some pressure because of the Keating
affair and this may be the way he wants to deal with it,'' said
David Shapiro, spokesman for Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., ranking
Republican on the Agriculture Committee. ``But there hasn't been
any cloud'' over donations from farm interests, he said.
   Nevertheless, Lugar postponed a fund-raiser with agriculture
groups until the Senate completes work on the 1990 farm bill,
Shapiro said. ``There's a heightened sensitivity to how things
appear.''
   Spokesmen for several chairmen and ranking minority members said
the senators screen individual contributions and return any that
appear tainted. But none were ready to ban all contributions from
one of their biggest sources of campaign dollars.
   Among those surveyed:
   _Energy and Natural Resources chairman Bennett Johnston, D-La.
He received $180,461 from energy industry political action
committees from 1983 through 1988, according to a study by the
public-interest group Common Cause.
   _Environment and Public Works chairman Quentin Burdick, D-N.D.,
who received $97,103 from energy PACs and $327,700 from labor PACs,
some of which have an interest in environmental legislation such as
the pending Clean Air Act rewrite.
   _Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee chairman Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C., who received $828,842 from business PACs.
   _Jake Garn, R-Utah, ranking Republican on the Banking Committee,
who received $195,375 from financial institution PACs including
$77,600 from those tied to S&amp;Ls.
   Riegle, D-Mich., last week announced he was giving the U.S.
Treasury an amount equal to all contributions he has gotten and
kept from S&amp;L interests since 1983.
   Rising public outrage over the multibillion-dollar thrift mess
is making the return of S&amp;L money an increasingly popular means of
declaring independence from the troubled industry.
   Riegle led the Senate in contributions from PACs representing
banks, S&amp;Ls, securities firms and others in the financial industry,
accepting $344,133 from 1983 through 1988, Common Cause said.
   Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, refuses money
from subsidiaries controlled by foreign corporations because he
favors legislation to outlaw contributions by those PACs, spokesman
Jack DeVore said.
   Bentsen was the top recipient of contributions from business PAC
donations, with $1.8 million.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, chairman of the Governmental Affairs
Committee, ``accepts contributions legally given and legally
received and he votes his conscience,'' spokesman Rebecca Bell
said. She declined to elaborate.
   Glenn received $693,166 from PACs between 1983 and 1988.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of the Veterans' Affairs
Committee, has no plans to follow Riegle's lead, a spokesman said.
He received $1.5 million from PACs from 1983-88, and ranked seventh
in receipts of labor PAC money with $410,600 and ninth in finance
PAC receipts with $209,195.
   Glenn and Cranston are targets of the ethics committee probe, as
are Riegle and Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and John McCain,
R-Ariz.

<HEAD>Alliance Moves for Uniform License Revocation Laws</HEAD>

   An alliance of government and private highway
safety advocates wants to give police the power to take away a
drunken driver's license on any road in the country.
   Claiming successes in 29 states where automatic revocation laws
are in effect, the heads of the National Transportation Safety
Board and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration called
Wednesday for a campaign to pass similar laws in the rest of the
nation.
   The aim is to give police in every state the power to suspend
the license of a driver who refuses or fails a roadside breath test
for alcohol consumption.
   The action is taken administratively, without a court decision.
A nonjudicial hearing may be held if the driver appeals. The laws
have passed all court tests in states where they have been applied,
officials said.
   In most states, the illegal level of alcohol in the blood is
0.10 percent, but five states _ California, Colorado, Oregon, Maine
and Utah _ have set the level at a more stringent 0.08 percent.
   The surgeon general has recommended that all states adopt the
tougher law and eventually go as low as 0.04 percent for adults and
0.00 for any driver under 21.
   More than 1.6 million drivers are arrested each year on drunken
driving charges, and about half of all the 45,000 traffic
fatalities each year are alcohol-related, according to the traffic
safety agency.
   ``We hope the coalition will stay active until we get the
administrative revocation law in all 50 states,'' said NTSB
Chairman James L. Kolstad, whose independent board has called for
such laws in its investigations of drunken driving accidents.
   Kolstad and traffic safety agency Administrator Jerry R. Curry
met with representatives of safety advocacy groups, the insurance
industry, police organizations and others to plan a campaign for
passage of laws in the remaining 21 states.
   ``The fact that in the morning a driver has a license, and if he
or she is foolish and drinks at lunchtime and then fails a breath
test, the license is lost on the spot'' would be a strong incentive
against drinking and driving, Kolstad said.
   Curry said he had followed drunken drivers through the process
of losing their licenses, being taken to a hospital for verifying
tests, being processed at a police station and then having to be
driven home by someone else.
   ``It's an absolutely debilitating experience. You think you're a
criminal. You are a criminal. This is a violent crime,'' he said.
   ``Without such laws, we have to go through the court system, and
if we're not able to get a trial date, that particular drunk's
license might not be pulled for months,'' Curry said.
   The administrator said the laws may be tough to get passed in
legislatures where it has become a states' rights issue. ``It's
going to be a hard push,'' he said.
   Opponents of the laws include some police agencies who are
concerned about the extra hearings required when driver's appeal
the revocations, from trail lawyers who defend arrested drivers,
and from some state motor vehicle officials concerned about the
administrative costs.
   The federal government offers incentives of up to several
million dollars to states which pass automatic revocation laws.
   Among organizations participating in the campaign are the
American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, American
Automobile Association, American Trucking Associations, Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety, International Association of Chiefs
of Police, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Motor Vehicle
Manufacturers Association and National Safety Council.
   States that do not have the automatic revocation laws are
Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington.

   The nation's privately run savings and loans
continue to pile up losses despite an all-out effort by the
government to seize failed institutions.
   The Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision said
Wednesday that the 2,505 S&amp;Ls outside government control on March
31 lost $271 million in the first three months of this year.
   That marked a sharp improvement from the $3.1 billion loss in
the final three months of 1989, but it was a drop from the slight
$10 million profit in the first quarter of last year.
   Information was withheld on an additional 350 still-open
institutions controlled by the Resolution Trust Corp., an agency
created last year to close and sell failed thrifts. It is expected
to issue data on those institutions next week.
   Nearly one-quarter of the surviving institutions lost money and
S&amp;Ls overall lost money in 20 states. Although there was a vast
improvement in Texas, the state hardest hit by the S&amp;L crisis, the
industry deteriorated in Northeastern states hit by lackluster real
estate markets.
   Texas thrifts lost $110 million in the January-March period,
compared with $2.2 billion in the same period a year earlier.
   However, S&amp;Ls in New York lost $162.9 million, compared with a
$61.6 million profit a year ago. Massachusetts lost $68 million,
compared with a $100,000 loss. The industry in Connecticut lost
$104.2 million, compared with a $3.5 million profit.
   Analysts contended that reporting profit results separately for
private and government-controlled thrifts amounts to sugar-coating
bad news and interferes with their ability to analyze the entire
industry. The thrift office collects information from both sets of
S&amp;Ls and in the past had always released both groups of figures.
   ``It's hogwash,'' said Bert Ely, a financial institutions
analyst in Alexandria, Va. The thrift office ``wants to be the good
news boys.''
   However, thrift office director Timothy Ryan declared, ``I'm not
... Mr. Rosy Scenario.''
   ``Putting the two together presents an inaccurate picture of the
industry,'' he said.
   In Wednesday's report, the thrift office did not say how much
the losses were reduced by government subsidies to S&amp;Ls bailed out
in 1988. Ely estimated the subsidy at between $1 billion and $1.5
billion per quarter.
   The 1988 deals are coming under increasing criticism from Sen.
Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and others in Congress who say they
provided acquirers with virtually guaranteed profits for very
little investment.
   Ryan, in a news release, greeted the first-quarter results as a
sign of progress. ``It appears that deposits and profits are
returning to the strong part of the industry,'' he was quoted as
saying.
   However, at a news conference, Ryan told reporters it was too
soon to draw conclusions from the data. He said he would not know
if the industry is capable of surviving until sometime early next
year.
   ``Should we jump up and down and declare victory?'' he asked.
``No. This is still a very tough situation, in my view.''
   The thrift office divided the S&amp;L industry into four parts: 310
institutions expected to fail, 311 struggling thrifts that may
fail, 620 S&amp;Ls that are somewhat weak but are expected to survive
and 1,264 institutions in good shape.
   Only the institutions in the last group earned what investors
consider an acceptable return, $692 million. The next best group
earned a subpar $192 million. The struggling S&amp;Ls lost $281 million
and the expected failures lost $874 million.
   ``You have an enormous segment of the industry that isn't making
it,'' Ely said.
   Wednesday's report was about a month late. Ryan said the agency
had changed its data collection process and hoped to release the
reports on time in the future.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Criticizes Mexican Demand for Turnover of Drug Agent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh says Mexico's
request for the arrest of a federal drug agent investigating the
1985 torture-murder of a colleague could disrupt improved law
enforcement cooperation.
   Thornburgh on Wednesday lashed out at the Mexican government's
refusal to cooperate in the investigation of the killing of Enrique
Camarena, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent who was
abducted in Guadalajara.
   Thornburgh said Mexico's request for the extradition of DEA
Agent Hector Berellez and an informant who arranged the April 2
kidnaping of a Guadalajara doctor charged with participating in
Camarena's killing was a ``step backward'' in improved U.S.-Mexican
law enforcement cooperation.
   The attorney general said Mexico appeared to be retaliating for
continued U.S. efforts in the case, which include the indictment
earlier this year of two former high-ranking Mexican law
enforcement officials on charges they participated in the killing.
   ``Unfortunately, it would appear this most recent action that's
contemplated by the government of Mexico is in some way intended to
retaliate for some of these efforts,'' Thornburgh said at the
National Press Club.
   ``We were obviously distressed by what could lead to a breakdown
in what had up to this date been a very constructive relationship
between Mexican and American authorities.''
   The Mexican government last week formally asked the State
Department to arrest Berellez and Antonio Garate Bustamante on
charges of illegally abducting Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain.
   Alvarez, a 42-year-old gynecologist, was seized at his office by
four armed men and flown to El Paso, Texas, where he was arrested
by DEA agents on charges of participating in the killing of
Camarena.
   Garate has said in interviews that he arranged for Mexican
police to kidnap Alvarez. Berellez testified in court that he was
authorized by senior DEA officials to approve the operation and
offered to pay $50,000 as reward plus expenses.
   Thornburgh said the request for the two extraditions marred a
``vast improvement in relationships between Mexican and American
law enforcement authorities'' that began when President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari took office in late 1988.
   He reiterated U.S. ``determination to see this prosecution
through'' and said ``it's a mistake for the government of Mexico
not to cooperate in this investigation, not to bring to justice
those persons who have engaged in acts or contributed to this
dreadful incident.''
   ``We will not rest until we have brought to the bar of our
justice those persons responsible,'' Thornburgh said. ``We hope and
expect that our friends and neighbors in Mexico will understand our
outrage and our determination to see this case through to
completion.
   ``We need to act together to deal with the drug traffickers, to
deal with the money launderers,'' the attorney general said. ``And
a step backward in that regard is something I think brings dismay
to all of us in law enforcement.''
   The Alvarez kidnaping sparked accusations that the United States
was encroaching on Mexican sovereignty.
   Thornburgh defended DEA's role in the Alvarez arrest during an
interview May 10 when he invited the delivery of other defendants
in the Camarena case that the Mexican government has declined to
turn over to American authorities.
   The defendants still at large in Mexico include the former head
of the Mexican Federal Judicial Police and the former head of the
Mexican branch of Interpol, the international law enforcement
agency.

   House Republicans say President Bush risks
losing the battle over military spending to the Democrats unless he
becomes personally involved in the fight.
   ``There's no guidance. I'm flying by instinct,'' Rep. Bill
Dickinson of Alabama, ranking Republican on the House Armed
Services Committee, said after he and other lawmakers met with Bush
on Wednesday.
   The president reiterated his support for the level of military
spending adopted by the Senate Armed Services Committee _ a total
of $289 billion that slashes $18 billion from his original request
for the 1991 fiscal year.
   In a session with Vice President Dan Quayle, Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney and national security adviser Brent Scowcroft, Bush
also urged lawmakers to approve continued production of the B-2
bomber, elements of the anti-missile Strategic Defense Initiative
and other major weapon systems.
   But with the House Armed Services Committee beginning to craft a
defense bill today to the House-approved figure of $283 billion _
and Democrats certain to push for deep cuts, GOP lawmakers pressed
the administration to indicate what level of spending is acceptable.
   ``There's no bottom line for SDI. No suggestion for B-2,'' said
Dickinson. He said he is willing to operate on his instincts but
would prefer that the administration state ``what is totally
unacceptable.''
   Republicans conceded that the administration is faced with a
difficult task because congressional and White House negotiators
have yet to reach agreement on how to cut $50 billion from the
deficit in fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1.
   ``The whole thing is lost in the mist of the budget summit,''
said Rep. Joseph McDade of Pennsylvania, ranking Republican on the
House Appropriations defense subcommittee.
   In the White House session, McDade said he proposed that Cheney
and the ranking members of the congressional armed services and
defense appropriations subcommittees work to reach agreement on a
military budget total.
   But that proposal received little support from lawmakers who
want to avoid pre-empting the budget summit.
   Conservative Democrats and Republicans are also pushing the
president to lobby harder for various weapons, warning that without
a phone call from Bush or an invitation to the White House the
program may be severely cut or killed.
   ``Everybody indicated that the president has to engage
himself,'' McDade said. ``He understands it.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said after the White House meeting that it will take
strenuous efforts by Bush, Cheney and Scowcroft to save the B-2
stealth bomber.
   The House Armed Services Committee is poised to follow its
chairman, Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., and end the program at the 15
planes currently in production.
   Support for the radar-evading aircraft is eroding in the
100-member Senate, where opponents say privately they have 40 solid
votes to cancel the weapon.
   The dire predictions come as Aspin's committee is weighing a
reduction in Bush's proposed budget of $4.7 billion for SDI to $2.9
billion, said congressional sources who requested anonymity.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee, in approving its version of
the bill, cut nearly $1 billion from the president's request.
   Several House Armed Services panels were beginning work on the
defense bill today, with the seapower and strategic and critical
materials subcommittee facing the toughest task _ cutting $3
billion from Bush's request of $16.3 billion for the Navy.
   The panel's chairman, Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., said it will
likely approve funds for one Trident nuclear missile submarine and
one Seawolf attack submarine.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee, in its bill, approved $1.2
billion for the Navy's 18th Trident sub but deferred the
administration's request to buy two Seawolfs for $2.3 billion.

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission relaxed the
control of low-level radioactive wastes despite repeated concerns
expressed by staff advisers and the Environmental Protection
Agency, internal documents show.
   The documents were obtained by a congressional panel that is
questioning the decision, announced last month, that the NRC no
longer regulate a wide range of low-level radioactive materials
from nuclear power plants, laboratories and hospitals.
   NRC commissioners were called to defend the action today before
the House Interior energy and environment subcommittee.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., the subcommittee's chairman, said
the NRC policy ``has the potential to endanger the public health''
and ``is an open invitation to abuse by unscrupulous operators''
who want to dump radioactive materials in ordinary landfills.
   Under the new policy, such low-level wastes as gloves, clothing,
lab equipment and even buildings and equipment at nuclear power
plants can be disposed of as if they were normal garbage if
radiation doses are below a certain level.
   The commission plans to consider exempting various wastes on a
case-by-case basis as requests for exemptions are submitted by
industry under the new policy guidelines.
   NRC Chairman Kenneth M. Carr has argued that the policy change
represents a way to save lives because federal and state regulators
will be able ``to spend our resources on threats that are more
important.''
   But representatives from the EPA, a half-dozen members of
Congress and a number of state radiation control officials were
expected to testify against the NRC action, announced on June 27.
   According to documents obtained by Miller's subcommittee, the
EPA as well as key NRC staff members expressed concern repeatedly
during the two years the new policy was being debated that too many
wastes are being deregulated.
   The NRC decision would exempt from special control wastes that
subject individuals to radiation doses of less than 10 millirem per
year _ half the level of a normal chest X-ray.
   ``We believe that is too high a level (of exposure) for a
blanket deregulation criteria and is not protective of the public
health,'' the EPA's Office of Radiation Programs, concluded in a
briefing paper submitted to the subcommittee. The EPA made similar
arguments to the NRC before the policy change was made.
   The EPA maintained that the 10 millirem cutoff for regulatory
action could result in as many as three additional cancer deaths
for every 10,000 people exposed. ``Numerous standards established
by the EPA, including those for drinking water, set upper limits of
risk at lower levels,'' it said.
   According to internal NRC memos and other documents, key
commission staff members also expressed strong reservations about
the 10 millirem cutoff level as the new policy was debated in 1988
and 1989.
   A staff report in June 1988 urged that only wastes with
radiation doses of 1 millirem per year be deregulated. Among those
who objected to the 10 millirem cutoff was Robert M. Bernero,
acting director of the NRC's Office of Nuclear Material Safety and
Safeguards, according to the documents.
   Bernero in one memo to his NRC superiors expressed concern about
the health effects to individuals who may be subject to numerous
exposures of such wastes and the long-term effect on such materials
on the waste stream.
   But the objections from Bernero and other staffers were
overruled by senior NRC officials, the documents indicated.
   The EPA later suggested the cutoff be set at 4 millirem per
year, but that was rejected.
   ``In their zeal to relax the regulation of the nuclear industry,
the NRC commissioners have ignored the objections of their own
staff experts, the Environmental Protection Agency, the states and
the public,'' said Miller.
   The nuclear industry _ as well as the NRC commissioners _ have
argued that the wastes that are at issue emit only extremely small
doses of radiation.

<HEAD>Treasury Chief Leans Toward Limiting Deposit Insurance to One
Account</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady appears
to be leaning against lowering the $100,000 limit on deposit
insurance but in favor of restricting insurance to one account per
person.
   In an appearance Wednesday before the Senate Banking Committee,
Brady refused to be pinned down on what specific changes he favors
in deposit insurance.
   But he said, ``I can't see a rush to lower it (the insurance
limit) at this particular time.''
   Asked about limiting insurance to one account per person, he
said, ``If you were going to start any place, that would be a place
to start.''
   Brady said the Treasury was studying a proposal to charge
depositors a fee for insurance, an idea that sparked a furor when
it was first floated by the Bush administration in January 1989 and
then quickly withdrawn.
   Currently, depositors do not pay for insurance directly.
However, banks and savings institutions pay a premium.
   Charging banks with risky portfolios more for deposit insurance
is an idea ``we should look very closely at,'' Brady said.
   His statements were similar to views expressed by Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to the Banking Committee earlier
this month.
   Brady agreed with Sen. Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich., the committee
chairman, and Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the senior Republican on the
panel, that Congress should overhaul the financial system next year.
   He said his department would make specific recommendations on
the overhaul after the end of this year when it completes a study
of the issues.
   Many economists blame deposit insurance for encouraging savings
and loan owners to speculate wildly because they knew the
government would pay off depositors if their gambles soured.
   However, Brady said the S&amp;L crisis should not deter Congress
from permitting commercial banks to venture into the insurance and
securities industries.
   ``I don't think we ought to take the thrift debacle and make it
such a big factor in our minds that we don't face the issues in the
banking industry,'' he said.
   The thrift industry was deregulated without requiring S&amp;L owners
to risk more of their own money, Brady said. Consequently, any
expansion of bank powers ought to be linked to strong capital
requirements, he said.
   ``We learned all too painfully from the thrift crisis that a
crucial protection for the taxpayer is requiring firms to have a
substantial amount of their own money at risk to absorb losses,''
he said.
   ``We will not propose changes to the financial services
regulatory structure that would increase the taxpayers' exposure,''
Brady said. ``... Retaining the status quo is not an attractive
option.''
   Banks are losing some of their best business to securities
firms, who underwrite short-term borrowing called commercial paper
for major companies, he said.
   At the same time, banks have been hindered from freely expanding
across state lines and fully entering such lucrative fields as
insurance and securities, the Treasury secretary said.
   As a result, banks have had to concentrate their lending in
riskier areas such as commercial real estate lending, energy and
farm loans and leveraged buyout loans, he said.
   Brady suggested ``there are lessons to be learned'' from the
banking system in Europe, where banks enjoy much wider financial
powers than in the United States.
   He also said the complex system of financial regulation in the
United States ought to be streamlined. Currently, there are three
federal agencies regulating banks, another overseeing S&amp;Ls and one
supervising credit unions, plus 50 state regulatory agencies.
   ``We ... need to explore the reform of our regulatory structure,
although, to be frank, the inevitable turf fights involved may
prevent the full achievement of this goal,'' Brady said.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Bill Headed for House Floor Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major legislation to curb job discrimination
is headed for House floor action with sponsors brushing off Bush
administration warnings that it would usher in the use of minority
hiring quotas.
   ``We did not bring forth a bill that will lead to quotas or any
danger of quotas,'' Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., said Wednesday
before the House Judiciary Committee approved the bill, 24-12.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said last week that the
measure, which closely matches a bill already passed by the Senate,
would not come up for House floor action until after lawmakers
return from their August recess.
   Civil rights forces, however, are urging him to reconsider and
bring the bill to the floor before the break.
   Five Supreme Court decisions last year would be effectively
overturned by the bill, the top legislative priority of the civil
rights movement.
   Provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in the
workplace to punitive damages for discrimination victims in extreme
cases.
   At the core of the debate is a provision designed to overcome a
Supreme Court ruling that favors employers in certain
discrimination lawsuits.
   Until last year, companies could win if they proved the
employment practices leading to the disparity were required by
``business necessity.'' The new ruling made it easier for
employers, placing on those filing suit the burden of proving the
practices in question were not business necessities.
   The combination of damages plus the bill's definition of
business necessity would trigger an upsurge in discrimination
suits, critics say.
   ``This should really be called the plaintiffs' lawyer's full
employment act of 1990,'' Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis.,
told the Judiciary Committee.
   Under the bill, business owners would feel compelled to turn to
racial and ethnic hiring quotas as a way of protecting themselves
in advance from such lawsuits, the administration contends.
   President Bush has said repeatedly that he would like to sign a
bill to combat job bias but not one that would lead to quotas.
   The Judiciary Committee's majority Democrats easily beat back
Republican-sponsored amendments designed to limit damages courts
could award discrimination victims and tighten the rules governing
fair-hiring lawsuits.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., conceded ``there are horror stories
about over-enforcement'' of similar laws, but he said such
instances were rare and that those intent on discriminating often
would find the means to get away with it.
   ``The advantage is overwhelmingly with the sophisticated
bigot,'' he said.
   Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., said the problem was that the
phrasing of the bill does more than merely negate last year's
Supreme Court decision and actually represents gains for civil
rights forces.
   ``I would concede the employer groups do not want a level
playing field _ they want one that assists them,'' Hyde said. ``But
I also learned that the civil rights groups do not want a level
playing field.''
   The House Education and Labor Committee, whose chairman, Rep.
Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., is a chief sponsor along with Edwards,
already has approved the legislation.
   Two minor amendments were adopted by the Judiciary Committee
before it approved the measure. One would clarify the definition of
business necessity.
   The second would encourage the use of dispute resolution
procedures outside the court system to resolve discrimination cases.
   Rep. Craig T. James, R-Fla., a veteran attorney, expressed
skepticism. He said urging non-judicial settlements was ``a
beautiful sentiment'' but that the amendment was ``a waste of
paper'' because it would never be used.

<TEXT>
   In a legislative race epitomizing
the conflict between young reformers and the old guard in the new
political climate, a lawyer with no political experience is taking
on the Communist Party boss.
   Ganbold, the 29-year-old candidate of the fledgling Party of
National Progress, favors rapid privatization and bold political
change.
   He says he volunteered to challenge 61-year-old Gombojavyn
Ochirbat, arguably the most powerful man in Mongolia, in Ulan
Bator's 12th District race for the Great People's Hural.
   It is the first time the Hural's 430 seats are being contested
by non-Communist parties, and the Communists say that shows how far
Mongolia has strayed from its authoritarian past in the seven
months since they agreed to reform under pressure of pro-democracy
street rallies.
   Ganbold and other opposition candidates want more change _ and
are finding considerable support among voters in the capital.
   In last Sunday's primary, Ochirbat received the most votes but
nearly half went to opposition candidates, including Ganbold.
   The other opposition parties are now backing Ganbold, the only
remaining opposition candidate in the district, and have given the
race top priority in this Sunday's second, decisive round of
balloting.
   ``The Communist Party in Mongolia is already going down, not
just the organization but the theory of communism. I decided it
would be appropriate not to allow the head of the Communist Party
to be a deputy,'' Ganbold said Wednesday.
   He spoke at party headquarters in a traditional-style ger, or
nomad's tent, after returning from a full day of meeting with
voters. He was weary but exhilarated.
   ``One of my fears that older people would be against me
disappeared today, as I met a lot of older people who said they
were willing to back me,'' he said.
   The communist Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, which has
ruled this Central Asian nation for seven decades, clearly regarded
District 12 as a safe place for Ochirbat to run.
   It is one of several bleak, impoverished shantytowns on the
fringes of Ulan Bator. Many of its 5,300 registered voters have
come recently from the countryside, where Communists are strongest
and where there is little news of the revolution that has swept
other Soviet bloc nations.
   Neither candidate is from the district _ residency is not a
legal requirement.
   Ochirbat may have expected that the residents could not resist
the chance to have the ruling party chief as their Hural delegate.
   The party chairman, a white-haired, dignified-looking man, took
office in March after popular demonstrations swept the incumbent of
six years from power. His past posts include head of the party
ideology department, president of the party-controlled trade union
and deputy chief of the party Organization Department.
   Ganbold is a junior-level officer in the Ministry of Law and
Jurisdiction. Like many Mongolian intellectuals, he studied in the
Soviet Union and says he learned there that communism doesn't work.
   He can make a good case that it hasn't worked well for District
12.
   ``The district has no kindergarten, no schools,'' Ganbold said.
``The electricity stops sometimes. There is no telephone in the
district.''
   Ganbold said he has cannot promise that he could provide the
services the district lacks, but can vow to give the problems more
attention.
   He admits his campaign got off to a slow start _ he didn't begin
door-to-door visits until Wednesday. But he said Ochirbat still
hasn't campaigned in person, sending high party officials instead.
   At a news conference Tuesday, Ochirbat said some Communist Party
members criticized the district's Communists for not campaigning
harder on his behalf. But he did not announce any plans for taking
a more active role.
   Nor did he outline any program for helping the district, saying
only that his party was now firmly on the path of reform.

   Eastern Airlines may have put thousands of
passengers at risk by falsifying jet maintenance records, federal
prosecutors said in announcing indictments against the carrier and
nine of its managers.
   Eastern, struggling to rebuild in bankruptcy court after a
bitter strike, replied that corrective actions have been taken and
the airline now is safe. Federal regulators agreed.
   Unprecedented in the airline industry, the 60-count indictment
unsealed Wednesday charged Eastern and high-level managers with
conspiring to falsify safety and maintenance records to avoid
flight delays and cancellations.
   ``The motivation was to get the airplanes into the air. An
airline only makes money with planes in the air,'' said Andrew J.
Maloney, a U.S. attorney in New York.
   Maloney said the charges involved critical items, including
radar, landing gear, automatic pilot instruments and fuel systems,
but that none of the alleged violations caused accidents or
injuries.
   ``Thousands of innocent passengers may have been put at risk
every day by the criminal actions of these defendants,'' Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh said in a statement.
   The charges, returned by a grand jury in Brooklyn, capped a
10-month investigation. Plea bargain talks collapsed when Eastern
refused to admit to a conspiracy.
   The indictment charges conspiracy, fraud, falsification of
documents and obstruction of justice.
   It names Eastern and high-level managers including Edward Upton,
former vice president of maintenance and engineering, and Thomas
Lewis, Eastern's maintenance director for the region from
Washington to Montreal.
   If convicted, Eastern faces a fine of up to $30 million. The
other defendants face up to five years in prison and fines up to
$250,000 on each count.
   Until a few days ago, five of the defendants were employed as
maintenance supervisors by Eastern, Maloney said. A 10th employee
will be charged separately, he said.
   The alleged violations took place from July 1985 to October 1989
at Kennedy and La Guardia airports in New York, Hartsfield Airport
in Atlanta and Eastern headquarters in Miami.
   By tampering with log books, work cards and computerized
maintenance records, Eastern caused ``aircraft that were not
properly maintained or repaired to fly and carry unsuspecting
passengers,'' the indictment charged.
   The Federal Aviation Administration said Eastern now meets
federal safety standards, and Eastern said in a statement that it
had taken ``full corrective action.''
   ``As a result, Eastern has become the most scrutinized airline
in the industry,'' the statement said. ``And today there is no
question that Eastern is safe.''
   The investigation began after an Eastern maintenance supervisor
told Maloney about irregularities.
   The grand jury found that Eastern managers had ordered that
maintenance not be performed on aircraft and that records be made
to reflect that it was, Maloney said. He said managers pressured
supervisors and mechanics to get the planes in the air ``or perhaps
risk their jobs.''
   Among the irregularities cited were a failure to properly pump
accumulated water out of jetliner fuel tanks. The water can freeze
at high altitude and clog fuel lines. It also makes fuel gauges
read high.
   Workers in Atlanta installed defective or untested cockpit
instruments to make it appear that repairs had been made, Maloney
said.
   Eastern employees went on strike on March 4, 1989. The airline
filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy code five days later. Pilots and flight attendants quit
the strike several months later, but mechanics remain on strike.
   Maloney said prosecutors had no evidence of improprieties at
Eastern since court-appointed trustee Martin Shugrue began running
the airline in in April.
   The indictments validate strikers' claims, an official of the
Machinists union said.
   ``Thousands of passengers were put on aircraft when they
shouldn't have been,'' Tony Chapman, vice president of Machinists
Local 1690, said in Atlanta.

   NASA's failure to fix Atlantis'
hydrogen leak bumped another shuttle flight into 1991. A team of
NASA experts, meanwhile, began looking into the $1.5 billion Hubble
Space Telescope's woes.
   But the space agency also got a bit of good news Wednesday: A
thrice-delayed launch of an unmanned Atlas rocket went off without
a flaw.
   ``It's good to have something positive happen,'' NASA spokesman
Jim Cast said. ``It's a definite boost to NASA morale.''
   After three postponements due to mechanical problems and bad
weather, the rocket blasted into space with a NASA and Air Force
satellite that will study electric and radiation fields far above
Earth.
   Earlier in the day, a last-ditch effort to fix Atlantis at the
launch pad failed. Atlantis became the second shuttle in two months
to be sent back to the hangar for repair of a hydrogen leak.
   The leak reappeared when liquid hydrogen was pumped into
Atlantis' external tank. It was the third such test of Atlantis,
but the agency still was unable to pinpoint the leak.
   NASA postponed the shuttle's secret Pentagon flight from this
month to November.
   Columbia, the first leaky shuttle rolled back from the launch
pad, now will be next to fly. Its astronomy mission, originally
scheduled for May, is set for September.
   ``We have every reason to believe that we have no more problems
ahead of us on Columbia,'' said William Lenoir, head of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's space flight
program.
   The space agency has replaced Columbia's leaky plumbing. Its
leak was believed to be larger than the one plaguing Atlantis and
in a different place.
   Atlantis' delay means NASA must bump another flight into 1991. A
second Atlantis mission set for this year, with the Gamma Ray
Observatory, originally was scheduled for November and now probably
will be early next year.
   Nine shuttle flights had been planned for 1990. The number is
down to seven now.
   The shuttle developments came as a space agency team began
investigating the cause of NASA's highest-profile problem: the
flawed mirror on the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope that is
sending back blurry images.
   The seven-member team, led by Lew Allen, director of NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, took testimony in secret Wednesday at the
plant where the mirror was made, Hughes-Danbury Optical Systems
Inc. of Danbury, Conn.
   Allen said the group hoped to find a ``smoking gun and a
fingerprint on the trigger.''
   The flaw has halved the effectiveness of Hubble, placed in orbit
in April by astronauts aboard Discovery, the last shuttle to fly. A
repair mission by space-walking astronauts is planned for 1993.
   The Hartford Courant reported Wednesday that scientists may have
discovered the flaw in May 1981 but dismissed the evidence because
they believed it was the result of a faulty testing apparatus.
   On the shuttle front, NASA officials had hoped Atlantis' problem
could be solved by tightening bolts around the suspected leak area,
a flange in a pipe that carries liquid hydrogen from the tank to
the main engines.
   The leak was discovered in a fueling test June 29, after which
NASA temporarily grounded the three-shuttle fleet.
   NASA wants to get at least one shuttle up before Discovery's
October mission with Ulysses, a satellite that will explore the
sun's poles.

<HEAD>Government Will Not Unfreeze Marcos Money for Quake Relief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By OLIVER TEVES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino will not
agree to release funds frozen by U.S. courts so that former first
lady Imelda Marcos can donate money to earthquake relief, Press
Secretary Tomas Gomez said today.
   On Wednesday, a lawyer for Mrs. Marcos said the former first
lady had offered to donate about $5 million for earthquake relief
if U.S. and Philippine officials agree to release money frozen by
American courts.
   ``The point is, if she (Mrs. Marcos) is really sincere about
giving money, she can get in touch with the Philippine National Red
Cross. That's as simple as that,'' Gomez said in an interview.
   Gomez said Mrs. Marcos, widow of the late President Ferdinand
Marcos, had money beyond that in the frozen accounts that she could
donate to the relief effort.
   Asked if the government was willing to unfreeze the Marcos
accounts, Gomez said: ``Of course not. Why should the government?
They (accounts) are all sequestered.
   ``The trouble with Imelda is she is so insincere,'' Gomez said.
``She is using the disaster for her foolishness.''
   Mrs. Marcos lawyer, James Linn, said some of the Marcos assets
frozen by the 1986 court order are in Swiss banks and some in Hong
Kong. He did not give an estimate of amount in the accounts.
   Linn said U.S. officials would be asked this week to issue a
court order releasing the funds.
   Philippine officials claim Marcos had kept up to $10 billion in
Swiss accounts, but no proof has been offered to support the amount
claimed.
   The July 16 earthquake killed more than 1,600 people, injured
more than 3,000 and destroyed the homes of 90,000 people in the
northern Philippines.
   Official preliminary estimates of damage totaled nearly $700
million. This is expected to rise as reports from remote areas
reach Manila.
   On July 2, a federal jury in New York acquitted Mrs. Marcos of
racketeering, fraud and obstructing justice in connection with the
alleged theft of more than $220 million from the Philippines
treasury during Marcos' 20-year rule.
   Mrs. Marcos has remained in New York, rather than returning to
Hawaii, where she had lived since fleeing Manila during the 1986
military-civilian uprising the Mrs. Aquino rode to power.
   Her husband died in Hawaii in September.
   Both the Philippines and U.S. governments have banned Mrs.
Marcos return to her homeland, citing national security threats.

<HEAD>Report Charges Israel, In Effect, Condones Needless Deaths</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LaBELLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American human rights group is accusing
Israel's government of condoning needless killing of Palestinians
by failing to curb soldiers' excesses or to adopt tight rules on
opening fire.
   ``Israeli policies all too often encouraged a lack of restraint
by IDF (Israel Defense Force) troops,'' says a 126-page report
released Wednesday by Middle East Watch, which is based in
Washington, D.C., and New York.
   The group says the death toll from army gunfire in the 31-month
Palestinian uprising could be drastically cut ``if senior military
and civilian officials were determined to stop unjustified
killings.''
   The report comes on the heels of similar findings by other human
rights groups. Early this month, Amnesty International said many
Palestinian victims in the uprising died ``in circumstances
suggesting excessive use of force or deliberate killings.''
   
   In a written response to the Middle East Watch report, the army
denied that Israel ignores Palestinians' rights or condones
violations.
   ``Israel is concerned about the issue of human rights no less
than its critics,'' the army said. It said that Israel has imposed
stricter restrictions on soldiers opening fire than mandated under
international law.
   The army also said the report completely ignores ``wide-ranging
incidents of terrorism in the uprising,'' including killings by
Palestinians of fellow Arabs as alleged collaborators with Israel.
   Eric Goldstein, the group's research director and author of the
report, said Middle East Watch officials have condemned
``collaborator killings'' in testimony before U.S. congressional
committees.
   The report says troops have confronted the uprising with loaded
M-16 or Galil assault rifles, while army figures show that soldiers
were faced with guns in only 5 percent of incidents. The other 95
percent involved stone throwing, slingshots and such weapons as
iron bars.
   ``The imbalance of weaponry underscores the propriety of
treating the intefadeh (uprising) as a civil revolt rather than a
war,'' the report says.
   In 450 Palestinian deaths through June 1989, no more than 16
soldiers were court-martialed on charges of causing death and no
more than 10 were convicted, says the report, which was released in
Jerusalem and Washington.
   The report uses the army death toll of 670 Palestinians killed
in army gunfire in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   According to figures gathered by The Associated Press, 724
Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldier and civilians in
the revolt. At least 242 Palestinians have been slain by fellow
Arabs, most as suspected collaborators. Forty-five Israelis also
have been killed.
   An Israeli human rights group said last month that soldiers
violated firing orders by shooting 14 Palestinians in the head,
chest or back despite regulations calling for them to aim for their
legs. The Israeli Center for Human Rights in the Occupied
Territories, known in Hebrew as Betselem, had studied casualties
during disturbances following the May 20 massacre of seven unarmed
Arab laborers by a deranged Israeli civilian.

   The dollar gained against the Japanese yen in Tokyo
on Thursday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost
ground.
   The dollar closed at 150.11 yen, up 0.98 yen from Wednesday's
close of 149.13 yen. After opening at 150.25 yen, the currency
ranged between 149.70 yen and 150.25 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed 331.52
points, or 1.05 percent, closing at 31,369.75. The index fell 1.19
points on Wednesday.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond was quoted at 85.79 points as of 3 p.m.,
down from Wednesday's close of 85.98. The yield stood at 7.460
percent, up from 7.425 percent.
   Currency dealers said the dollar opened higher as traders showed
their belief that easing U.S. interest rates had receded, but then
weakened slightly on dollar-selling by importers.
   ``The dollar turned a bit bearish,'' said Kozo Yoshida, a dealer
with Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank.
   Yoshida said the dollar's retreat from its opening was partly
attributable to an easing of tension in the Persian Gulf.
   Diplomatic sources, based in the Persian Gulf, said Iraqi troops
would begin pulling back from the border with Kuwait Thursday prior
to direct talks to try to solve the two nation's dispute over land
and oil production.
   Kuwait had insisted that Iraq withdraw what it claimed were
massed forces at their common 100-mile border before Kuwait would
sit down for negotiations this weekend with Baghdad, said the
sources who spoke anonymously.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index started falling with a
wait-and-see attitude prevailing among many market players, coupled
with the yen's weakness against the dollar, said a dealer with
Nomura Securities, who spoke anonymously.

   A satellite that will illuminate
Earth's invisible magnetic field in shades of red, white and blue
orbited the world today after a flawless ride into space on an
unmanned rocket.
   The 143-foot Atlas rocket roared into a clear sky Wednesday from
Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and the satellite separated as
planned after several delays.
   ``It's always a good feeling to see a launch vehicle leave the
ground,'' NASA manager Sid Saucier said. ``So far, everything is
going great.''
   It was the fourth attempt in six days by NASA and rocket builder
General Dynamics to launch the Atlas, the first commercial version
of the rocket ever flown. The postponements were caused by a helium
leak, bad weather and a corroded power transfer switch in the
rocket.
   The weather was perfect as the Atlas boosted the $189 million
Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite to an orbit 217
miles by 22,236 miles high to study radiation in space.
   The 2-ton satellite, a joint program of NASA and the Defense
Department, holds 24 chemical-filled canisters that will be ejected
starting this fall. Ultraviolet rays from the sun will ionize the
released barium, lithium and other chemicals, creating large,
glowing clouds that will spread along Earth's magnetic field lines.
   The barium-laden clouds will resemble the aurora borealis, or
the northern lights. The display will be visible to the naked eye,
enabling scientists to measure electric fields in space and see how
they interact with normally invisible charged particles.
   The first releases will be made over American Samoa in the South
Pacific in September. Four months later, people in North America
will get their first glimpse of the clouds. Additional canisters
will be released next summer over the Caribbean, providing a view
from Florida and the southern portions of Alabama and Georgia.
   Wednesday's launch was the first of a commercial Atlas and the
eighth commercial rocket launch by an American company. NASA used
earlier versions of the Atlas to launch planetary probes and other
mid-size payloads.

<HEAD>Lab Mouse Supply Restored After Fire</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BAR HARBOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year after fire wiped out the
nation's leading producer of laboratory mice, breeders at the
Jackson Laboratory are nearly back to full production.
   Last year, the director of the National Institutes of Health
said the loss of the mice was ``creating a very serious problem for
research scientists all over the world.''
   Now, production had returned to almost 80 percent of what it had
been, laboratory director Kenneth Paigen said Wednesday. Before the
May 10, 1989, fire, the lab distributed 2 million mice a year to
11,200 laboratories worldwide.
   Many of the mice, which carry unusual mutations and conditions
that mimic human diseases, are unavailable anywhere else.
   ``The demand now is greater than it has ever been before,''
Paigen said.
   The laboratory's mice were used in 80 percent to 90 percent of
the scientific studies with mice published in leading journals last
year, Paigen said.
   Ninety-six percent of mouse studies on AIDS relied on Jackson
Laboratory mice, he said.
   The fire destroyed the large mouse breeding facility at the
laboratory, but did not spread to the research labs, which are in a
separate building.
   Four hundred thousand mice died in the fire. But at least some
individuals or frozen embryos of all strains survived, so no
valuable mutant mice were permanently lost.
   The threat of another supply interruption remains, however,
because temporary breeding facilities set up in trailers after the
fire could suffer power losses, Paigen said.
   Ground has been broken for the construction of new permanent
breeding facilities, he said. The recovery's total cost is expected
to be $32 million, of which Congress has approved up to $25 million.

<HEAD>Report Sets Timetable for Developing High-Speed Magnetic Train</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army Corps of engineers has laid out a
plan under which the federal government can help U.S. industry
develop high-speed magnetic trains by the year 2000.
   The corps' ``Preliminary Implementation Plan,'' released
Wednesday, sets a timetable under which various federal agencies
would evaluate and eventually oversee the development of magnetic
levitation trains in the United States.
   Under the plan, the federal agencies studying the feasibility
mag-lev trains should know by 1993 whether the United States can
regain the lead in this transportation technology.
   ``We believe there is a golden opportunity for magnetic
levitation in this country,'' said Dan Mauldin, deputy director of
civil works for the Army Corps of Engineers.
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said the report echoes what he and
Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., have been saying: ``If we want a
U.S. mag-lev and its benefits, we must put U.S. money into it.
Foreign money will get us foreign mag-lev systems.''
   Mag-lev trains are propelled by magnets on a cushion of air over
a rail. Such trains could travel up to 300 miles per hour, use less
energy than conventional transportation modes and would be cheaper
to ride than airplanes, according to the report.
   So far, only the Japanese and the Germans have developed
prototype mag-lev trains but several projects are under discussion
in the United States.
   Mag-lev was invented and pioneered in the 1960s and 1970s by
Americans, including James Powell and Gordon Danby at Brookhaven
National Laboratory on Long Island. But U.S. advances stopped
around 1974 when the federal role in mag-lev development ended,
Moynihan said at a news conference.
   The report released Wednesday estimated it would cost between
$800 million and $1.2 billion to develop a 20-mile, single track
demonstration project, not including the cost of land for right of
way.

   Foreign investors sold $4.2 billion worth of
American stocks and bonds more than they bought in the first three
months of 1990.
   The Securities Industries Association reported Wednesday that
the biggest item was a net sale of U.S. Treasury bonds: $6.5
billion worth. There were also net sales of $3.3 billion worth of
U.S. stocks.
   Net foreign purchases of bonds issued by U.S. agencies and
private companies amounted to only $5.6 billion.
   The association called these figures a sign that the United
States can no longer count on foreigners to finance its federal
budget deficit and provide money for U.S. industry.
   Net sales of U.S. Treasury bonds by Japan alone amounted to $2.9
billion, compared with net purchases of $1.4 billion in the last
quarter of 1989. Japanese also sold a net $702 million worth of
stock in U.S. companies and $84 million worth of their bonds.
   In 1989 foreigners bought nearly $55 billion worth of U.S.
Treasury bonds, a record level.

   Emergency workers and bystanders
showered in the middle of a busy street to wash off a powdery
residue, 22 people were taken to the hospital and two federal
agencies are investigating.
   A major chemical spill? No, a minor rear-end auto accident in
which one car's air bag deployed.
   ``Nobody at the scene had a handle on the procedures for the
situation and there were a lot of people there with a lot of
emergency experience,'' said Jeff Wells, who heads the ambulance
service in neighboring Weehawken.
   Federal transportation and consumer officials say that the
hysteria was unnecessary and that the incident in this New York
City suburb points up the need for rescue workers to learn how to
handle accidents involving air bags, standard equipment in about 3
million 1990 cars.
   The confusion began when Patricia Sanchez's 1990 Plymouth
Sundance hit a car stopped for a red light and her car's air bag
deployed.
   The nylon bag stored in the hub of the steering wheel inflates
in one-twentieth of a second and deflates through vents in its side
within a few more seconds. Packed in cornstarch or talcum for
lubrication, the deployed bag gives off a puff of powder and leaves
a fine white residue inside the car.
   But rescue workers believed the air bag had exploded and spewed
sodium hydroxide, a form of lye, on Ms. Sanchez.
   A quarter-gram of sodium hydroxide, along with a small amount of
baking soda, are created as byproducts of the chemical reaction
that inflates an air bag in a front-end collision, said Tim Hurd,
spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
which is investigating the crash.
   The amount of lye is minuscule, and it's only a minor irritant,
he said.
   But rescue crews cut away some of Sanchez' clothes, thinking
they were contaminated with chemicals. Firefighters cordoned off
the intersection, set up a shower in the street and rinsed off
anyone who came in contact with the powder.
   Emergency workers, fearing more trouble with the bag, cut it out
of the car and now can't find it.
   ``They were frightened of the powder,'' said Louis Ciavatti,
acting city fire chief. ``It could have been overplayed.''
   ``There is absolutely no reason to hang back and delay treatment
because an air bag has deployed,'' Hurd said.
   The problem is that air bags and the way they work are still a
mystery to many people, said Frank Ghiorsi, regional director for
the National Transportation Safety Board, which is also
investigating the July 14 crash.
   Hurd said he interviewed Sanchez and she does not think the air
bag malfunctioned. He also said there were no stray bag fragments
or other evidence of an explosion in the car.
   Twenty-two people were taken to Jersey City Medical Center, and
10 of them were treated as if they had been exposed to sodium
hydroxide, said hospital spokeswoman Sheila Paris Klein. Sanchez
also was treated for chemical burns and spent two nights in the
hospital.
   But federal investigators believe Sanchez only suffered friction
burns from the inflating air bag. They don't believe any of the
other injured were exposed to lye.
   Clarence Ditlow of the Center for Auto Safety in Washington, a
consumer group that supports air bags, said drivers have suffered
friction burns but never chemical burns from air bags.
   Alan Miller, a spokesman for Chrysler Corp., which manufactures
the Sundance, said the company will investigate the incident.
   Passive restraints, either air bags or automatic seat belts, are
required in front seats in all 1990 domestic cars. Bags are
contained in all Chrysler U.S.-made cars, about half of Ford Motor
Co. cars and about 15 percent of General Motors Corp. cars.
   GM held a seminar in June to teach U.S. and Canadian
firefighters about the new technology and rescue techniques
involving air bags.

<HEAD>Marilyn Quayle Released Four Days After Hysterectomy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marilyn Quayle has been released from Bethesda
Naval Hospital, four days after undergoing a hysterectomy.
   The vice president's press office said Wednesday that the
operation was performed because Pap smears indicated she had
``severe dysplasia,'' a cell abnormality that experts said can be a
precursor to cervical cancer.
   The announcement was the most specific yet about the surgery
performed on the vice president's wife.
   ``Mrs. Quayle had two abnormal Pap smears earlier in the year,''
Quayle press secretary David Beckwith said in a written statement.
``A Cone biopsy was performed and revealed sever dysplasia. A
hysterectomy was performed Saturday morning.
   ``Because of early detection due to the excellent work of the
cytologists at the National Naval Medical Center, Mrs. Quayle is
expected to have a full and complete recovery,'' he said.
   Dr. Allan B. Weingold, chairman of the department of obstetrics
and gynecology at George Washington University Medical Center, said
severe dysplasia is ``a premalignant disease'' that is ``100
percent curable'' by a hysterectomy.
   ``She is cured,'' said Weingold, who was not involved in
treating the vice president's wife.
   He said experts grade dysplasias as mild, moderate and severe.
Beyond that, the cell abnormalities are classified as carcinoma in
situ, or already advanced to the cancerous state, and, in the final
stage, as invasive cancer.
   Not all dysplasias become cancers.
   ``She was two steps away on the benign side from invasive
cancer,'' said Weingold. ``It's 100 percent curable by the kind of
surgery she had. That's the whole purpose of the Pap smear.''
   A hysterectomy involves removing all or part of a woman's
uterus, ending her ability to bear children.
   Mrs. Quayle turns 41 on Sunday. The Quayles have three children,
ages 16, 13 and 11.

<HEAD>De Beers Tightens Grip on Diamond Market With Soviet Deal</HEAD>

   The Soviet Union will get more badly needed
foreign hard currency by selling its rough diamonds exclusively
through the South African giant De Beers in a five-year
multibillion-dollar agreement.
   The company is advancing the Soviets $1 billion against future
diamond sales, said officials who announced the agreement on
Wednesday.
   The Soviet Union, among the world's largest diamond producers,
reached the deal with De Beers because it wanted to sell a huge
stockpile of diamonds without disrupting the market, De Beers said.
   The Soviet Union had refused to deal directly with the South
African company because of apartheid, but now is willing to openly
do business with De Beers' new Swiss arm, De Beers Centenary AG.
   South Africa-based De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., controlled
by the Oppenheimer family of South Africa, established the
publicly-held Swiss company in May.
   De Beers Centenary said in a statement that it reached the
agreement with Glavalmazzoloto of the USSR for the exclusive export
and sale of the Soviet Union's diamond production.
   Glavalmazzoloto is the main administration for precious metals
and diamonds under the Soviet Union's council of ministers, De
Beers said.
   It said its Luxembourg-based subsidiary, Centenary Holdings SA,
has agreed to make a secured advance of $1 billion to
Glavalmazzoloto against future diamond deliveries.
   Repayment would be made over five years beginning in November,
it said.
   Nicholas Oppenheimer, deputy chairman of De Beers Centenary,
said as a result of the agreement that the Soviet Union, at a time
of ``considerable financial strain,'' was assured ``a steady flow
of funds from diamonds'' during the life of the contract.
   Company officials estimated the contract could be worth as much
as $5 billion.
   Moscow has been seeking foreign credit as it tries to bring
market-oriented reform to an economy plagued by shortages.
   The Soviet diamond stockpile will be held at De Beers'
London-based marketing arm, the Central Selling Organization, as
collateral for the $1 billion advance, De Beers said.
   The organization, a 57-year-old cartel, has the financial
resources to hold large stocks of diamonds, which is how it keeps
the market stable.
   Although De Beers said it had had no direct contact with the
Soviet Union since 1963, diamond experts say De Beers already sells
most of the Soviet Union's West-bound diamonds.
   All the world's major diamond producers, including Botswana,
Australia, Tanzania, Zaire and Namibia, have sales contracts with
De Beers Centenary. The Central Selling Organization, as a result,
markets 80 percent of the world's rough diamond production of some
100 million carats.
   The organization had sales of $4.09 billion last year.
   Large-scale diamond mining began in the Soviet Union in the
1950s and is concentrated in the Yakutia region of North Eastern
Siberia, De Beers said. The Soviet Union doesn't disclose the value
of its output.

   Six U.S. soldiers who went AWOL from intelligence posts in West
Germany and were arrested at a Florida beach known for UFO reports
won't be court-martialed. But many other questions about the
bizarre case remain.
   Were the six _ five men and a woman _ acting on ``psychic
input'' from biblical figures and preparing for the world's end, as
a friend of one suggested?
   Did they plan to move to the West and live ``like a survivalist
group,'' as a police captain said he was told by two in the group?
   Or was there another explanation of the events that began
unfolding when the six, who held top-secret security clearances,
left the 701st Military Intelligence Brigade in Augsburg, West
Germany, early this month?
   ``Don't judge them yet. They have a right to defend
themselves,'' said Anna Foster, at whose Gulf Breeze, Fla., home
four of the six were arrested July 14. Ms. Foster, a civilian
described by authorities as a psychic, is not charged in the case
and said she could not elaborate.
   The Army offered the six ``non-judicial punishment'' _ no trial
by court-martial _ after an investigation by the Army Intelligence
and Security Command found no evidence of espionage, officials said
Wednesday.
   At Fort Knox, Ky., where the six were being held, Maj. Ron
Mazzia said they could receive reductions in pay or rank, or both,
and could be fined. Specific terms will be determined by an officer
acting as a sentencing judge.
   Having lost their security clearances, the six might be
discharged, Mazzia said.
   They were reported missing in West Germany on July 9. On Friday
the 13th, Pfc. Michael Hueckstaedt was stopped in Gulf Breeze for
driving a van with non-working taillights. A computer check found
him listed as absent without leave.
   Army information and a search of the van revealed the
whereabouts of the five other soldiers, Gulf Breeze police Capt.
Kenneth Hicks said.
   Besides Hueckstaedt, 19, of Farson, Wyo., they are Pfc. Kris
Perlock, 20, of Osceola, Wis.; Pfc. William Setterberg, 20, of
Pittsburgh; Spc. Vance Davis, 25, of Valley Center, Kan.; Spc.
Kenneth Beason, 26, of Jefferson City, Tenn., and Sgt. Annette
Eccleston, 22, of Hartford, Conn.
   Hicks said Ms. Eccleston and Hueckstaedt said little when
questioned by him and the FBI.
   ``Really the only thing they said is they were heading out west
and they were just going to kind of live out in the woods, kind of
like a survivalist group,'' Hicks said. He said they mentioned
Santa Fe, N.M., and Texas.
   As the six were moved first to Fort Benning, Ga., and then to
Fort Knox, another story emerged. It focused on Beason, doing his
second hitch in the Army.
   Beason had trained in Pensacola and dated and corresponded with
Ms. Foster. He always was interested in science fiction. Beason
created miniature spaceship models and other artwork and was trying
to write a book, friends said.
   ``He can draw or make anything, as long as it's not real,'' said
Beason's brother-in-law, Charles Reed.
   Four or five years ago, Beason hired commercial photographer
Stan Johnson of Bybee, Tenn., to photograph some of his creations.
Johnson and his wife, Vivian, a former English teacher, helped him
with his writing. They're in their 50s and said they became a kind
of second family for Beason.
   During a two-week visit last Christmas, Beason seemed his usual
self, but in a few phone calls since May, he took a different turn.
   ``He just reeled and rambled and ranted,'' said Mrs. Johnson,
describing one call.
   She said he thought ``the disciples and some of the other
spirits have talked to him or else one of the other people in that
group, the group that was arrested _ and told them the Rapture is
near and for them to prepare for it.''
   Some fundamentalist Christians believe that during the Rapture,
believers will be swept to heaven before the world ends. Some
relatives who helped raise Beason after his parents divorced were
fundamentalists, friends said.
   Mrs. Johnson said Beason wouldn't be swayed when she questioned
his statements.
   ``He'd say, `You just don't understand. I am a chosen. ... I've
been told to do this,''' she said.
   Do what, specifically?
   Beason said he and the others would go to Florida on ``a
missionary project'' to prepare for the end, Stan Johnson said.
``The real interesting part of this was that, when the second
coming of Christ occurred, Jesus Christ was going to arrive in a
spaceship.''
   Reed added: ``He thinks he's doing ... what God wants him to.''
   Beason and Hueckstaedt found a used Volkswagen van after they
flew from West Germany to Tennessee and apparently picked up the
other AWOL soldiers for a drive to Gulf Breeze, a Florida Panhandle
town whose claim to fame is the number of reported sightings of
unidentified flying objects.
   A symposium of the Mutual UFO Network concluded there July 8,
police said.
   Lee Perlock, the mother of Kris Perlock, said her family was
close and their religious practices were mainstream. Other
relatives of the soldiers said the same thing about their religious
backgrounds but were reluctant to discuss details of discussions
with them after the arrests.
   Notified of the Army's disciplinary decision, Mrs. Perlock's
husband, Ron, reacted with relief. ``This has been going on for so
long, not knowing.''
   They hope to see their son soon. In the meantime, Mrs. Perlock
said softly, there are ``a lot of unanswered questions.''

<TEXT>
   Researchers have found a defect in the
body's ``scaffolding'' that may cause a genetic disease that makes
people unusually tall and lanky and might have affected Abraham
Lincoln.
   The disease, called Marfan syndrome, can also include severe
heart problems that may cause basketball players to die suddenly on
the court, Dr. Reed Pyeritz of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine
in Baltimore said Wednesday.
   Pyeritz and his colleagues identified the defect in a protein
called fibrillin, a component of the elastic fibers in skin, blood
vessels and ligaments.
   ``There's something wrong with the scaffolding and glue that
holds us together,'' Pyeritz said at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar
Harbor, where some of the nation's leading researchers have
gathered for an annual genetics course.
   Lynn Sakai of the Oregon Health Sciences University, who
collaborates with Pyeritz, has identified the gene for fibrillin
and is now conducting studies to determine its function.
   She said in a telephone interview that she and Pyeritz soon will
be able to confirm whether a defect in the fibrillin gene and the
consequent defect in fibrillin itself are the cause of Marfan
syndrome.
   Meanwhile, a research group in Finland has obtained preliminary
evidence through an entirely different approach that the genetic
defect for Marfan syndrome is on chromosome 15, one of the 23 pairs
of human chromosomes.
   If the fibrillin gene is also on chromosome 15, that will be
further evidence that the gene is indeed the cause of the disorder,
Sakai said.
   ``If fibrillin is lnked, that would be quite a breakthrough,''
she said.
   Doctors have speculated that Lincoln had Marfan syndrome, not
only because he was tall and lanky but also because toward the end
of this life he had an illness that could have been congestive
heart disease, Pyeritz said.
   That is one of the consequences of a defect that causes the
aorta, the principal output vessel from the heart, to expand and
tear.
   The aorta problem is also what causes the on-court death of
basketball players and can cause sudden death in others with Marfan
syndrome, Pyeritz said.
   The discovery of the gene for Marfan syndrome would enable
doctors to begin devising new treatments, but it would not
guarantee any change in the near future for Marfan victims, Pyeritz
said.
   People with the disorder can currently be helped by surgery to
replace part of the aorta with a dacron tube, Pyeritz said.
   Other aspects of the disease can be difficult to treat, however.
Many patients have a dislocation of the lenses in their eyes, and
some are blind. Others have curvature of the spine, chest
deformities and loose joints.
   The work by Pyeritz and Sakai and their colleagues identifying
fibrillin comes after researchers have tried for years to determine
what defect could cause such a wide range of symptoms.
   The elastic fibers containing fibrillin are found in eye
ligaments, bones, blood vessels and other affected tissues, Pyeritz
said.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher, Stocks Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar moved higher against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo today, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell
for the fifth consecutive trading day.
   The dollar closed at 150.11 yen, up 0.98 yen from Wednesday's
finish of 149.13 yen. It opened at 150.25 yen, the day's high, and
moved as low as 149.70 yen.
   The dollar has gained 2.86 yen in the six trading days after it
fell to 147.25 yen last Wednesday.
   Spot transactions totaled $10.112 billion, down from Wednesday's
$11.130 billion.
   ``The sentiment toward the dollar turned strong in the
afternoon,'' said Chiyuki Watanabe, a dealer with Sanwa Bank.
   In addition to diminishing prospects for easing U.S. interest
rates, Ms. Watanabe said another negative factor for the yen was a
mid-day local news report that Tokyo tax authorities have decided
to impose a total of $46.6 million in taxes on Japanese securities
firms which allegedly compensated losses of major clients after the
1987 Black Monday stock plunge.
   News reports said more than 10 securities companies compensated
a combined total of as much as $113 million for their major
institutional and individual clients.
   Officials of the Tokyo Tax Administration refused to comment on
the report, saying an investigation is still under way.
   The news reports said the tax agency determined that the costs
used as compensation by securities firms involved fell under
``entertainment expenses,'' which are subject to taxation.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues lost 331.52 points, or 1.05 percent, closing at 31,369.75.
The index shed a marginal 1.19 points on Wednesday.
   The Nikkei index has lost 1,685.87 points in five trading days.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 330 million shares,
down from Wednesday's 350 million shares.
   Yozo Asai, an analyst with Yamaichi Securities, said weakening
bond prices and concern over higher interest rates in Japan
dampened the market.
   ``To make matters worse, the news of (securities firms'
compensation of losses) made many market players lose''
confidence,'' Asai said.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No.119 10-year
Japanese government bond slipped to 85.62 points as of 5 p.m. (4
a.m. EDT), down from Wednesday's 85.98. The yield stood at 7.500
percent, up from 7.420 percent.

   Jeans commercials showing Marla Maples dumping
two supermarket tabloids into a trash can have been banned from CBS
and NBC.
   The 15-second spots feature Maples, rumored to be Donald Trump's
mistress, in a pastoral setting wearing No Excuses jeans and
holding copies of the National Enquirer and Star. An Enquirer
headline reads: ``Trump Mistress Close to Suicide.''
   ``The most important thing we can do today is clean up our
planet. And I'm starting with these,'' Maples says as she tosses
the papers. ``Things look better already.''
   Beth Bressan, a CBS vice president in charge of program
practices, said the ad was rejected as ``unduly disparaging towards
those newspapers.''
   ``Our longstanding policy is not to sell ad time for the airing
of private disputes,'' said Rick Gitter, NBC vice president of ad
standards.
   Neil Cole, president of New Retail Concepts, which makes the
jeans, said he doubted his company would change the commercials.
   ABC hasn't made a decision on the spots. The Fox network and the
Turner Broadcasting System have decided to air the ads beginning

   Dimitrios I, spiritual leader of 250
million Eastern Orthodox Christians, visited Niagara Falls as part
of his monthlong tour of the United States.
   The 75-year-old patriarch leaned against a railing Wednesday and
gazed at Horseshoe Falls.
   Dimitrios I did not mention the falls in either of his public
addresses in upstate New York. But American Orthodox leaders said
visiting the cataract had been his dream since childhood.
   ``All the Europeans, they dream someday to see these
phenomena,'' said Bishop Timotheos of Detroit, whose diocese
includes upstate New York.
   Later in the day the patriarch went to Boston, the final stop on
the first ever U.S. visit by a holder of his office. Dimitrios I
has sought to bridge the gap between the Greek and other national
Orthodox churches in the United States.

local level.
   Saving the environment is ``the most important task that faces
the human race at this time,'' Denver said at a news conference
Wednesday.
   The institute will be co-sponsored by the Amway Corp. of Ada,
Mich., the U.N. Environment Program and the National Aeronautics

   Brenda Feigen, co-founder of Ms. Magazine and
producer of the movie ``Navy SEALS,'' says she did her part to
improve the action film's portrayal of women.
   ``Navy SEALS,'' starring Charlie Sheen, features the elite force
of highly trained Navy teams fighting terrorists.
   ``I think it is feminist, humanist to hate terrorism. It is
natural and logical,'' Feigen said.
   Feigen concedes she was concerned about the portrayal of women
in the Orion release. She runs the production company that made the
film.
   ``There were scenes with the role of Claire (co-star Joanne
Whalley-Kilmer) that made no sense ... and in one instance there
was a reference to her so obscene I can't even repeat it,'' she
said. ``I said this has to go.''
   Her next project is more directly tied to her past work with the
American Civil Liberties Union and the women's movement _ a
made-for-TV movie about two black girls in the South sterilized
against their will.

<TEXT>
   A Maryland windshield wiper inventor who
was awarded $5.2 million in a patent infringement lawsuit against
Ford Motor Co. is serving a 120-day sentence for nonpayment of
alimony.
   Montgomery County Circuit Judge J. James McKenna sentenced
Robert W. Kearns of Gaithersburg on Friday after a contempt hearing
that day on Kearns's refusal to comply with terms of a 1989 divorce
decree, court records show.
   Kearns, 63, refused to vacate his house and share award proceeds
with his ex-wife.
   On July 13, a federal court in Detroit ordered Ford Motor Co. to
pay Kearns royalties for his patent for intermittent windshield
wipers.
   Kearns, who was once offered $30 million to settle the Ford
case, has similar patent infringement suits pending against General
Motors Corp., Chrysler Corp. Daimler-Benz AG, Honda Motor Co.
Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor Co. and 24 other car manufacturers.
   Kearns could be released from the Montgomery County jail in
Rockville before the 120-day period ends if he meets all of the
conditions set by the judge.
   Court records said Kearns must pay $700 in back alimony for June
and July and remove his belongings from the Gaithersburg house by
Aug. 15.
   A buyer is ready to settle on the property once Kearns vacates
it, the documents said. Kearns has listed the Omni International
Hotel in Detroit as a temporary address.
   McKenna also ordered Kearns to designate his former wife,
Phyllis Kearns, as the primary beneficiary of his life insurance
policies, said William Paton, a Rockville lawyer familiar with the
suit.
   Paton said McKenna also has asked Kearns to establish ``some
sort of financial mechanism'' for Phyllis Kearns to receive 10
percent of the award from his patent litigation.
   Kearns and his wife filed for a divorce April 9, 1986, in
Montgomery County Circuit Court. A revised final divorce order was
issued in May 1989 by Judge Peter Messitte.
   Earlier this month, Kearns filed an appeal to the Maryland Court
of Special Appeals contesting McKenna's order to vacate the home,
court records said.

   Former Exxon Valdez skipper Joseph
Hazelwood could be back in command of a ship in nine months under a
penalty imposed by the Coast Guard for the nation's worst oil spill.
   Hazelwood, in an interview, said he was satisfied that the Coast
Guard dismissed misconduct and negligence charges against him and
decided to let him to resume his career.
   At a Coast Guard hearing Wednesday, Administrative Law Judge
Harry Gardner suspended Hazelwood's captain's license for nine
months and put him on probation for three more months.
   Misconduct and negligence charges were dismissed after Hazelwood
agreed to enter no-contest pleas on two other counts: that he
violated Coast Guard policy by drinking liquor less than four hours
before taking command of the tanker, and that he improperly left
the vessel's bridge while it was headed for jagged Bligh Reef.
   But Hazelwood said after the hearing he was angered by newly
disclosed papers about crucial blood-alcohol tests that had implied
he was drunk when the tanker spilled nearly 11 million gallons of
crude last year.
   Hazelwood's attorneys said the blood analyzed may not have been
his.
   ``It's what we said all along and nobody would listen to us,''
Hazelwood said. ``The possible skulduggery that goes along with it
is enough to make anybody angry.
   ``If it weren't for our discovery of this, it would have been
buried forever and a lot of people with political agendas would
have been very happy.''
   Hazelwood's attorneys contended that evidence may have been
covered up, a charge the Coast Guard and National Transportation
Safety Board denied.
   The 987-foot tanker was en route from the Alaskan port of Valdez
to Long Beach on March 24, 1989, when it struck the reef in Prince
William Sound.
   Wednesday's hearing followed a trial in which an Alaskan jury
acquitted Hazelwood of charges of intoxication and recklessness,
but convicted him on a misdemeanor of negligently discharging oil.
He is appealing.
   ``We've cleared the two major hurdles as far as my personal life
is concerned,'' said Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y. ``Of
course, I'd like to wake up tomorrow morning and it would all be
done, but that's not going to happen.''
   He said his life has been consumed by litigation since the
disaster put his name in headlines. Asked if could he ever see a
time in his life when he would be free of litigation, Hazelwood
sighed and said, `Not in this century. I can see going into the
year 2000 with some pending litigation of some sort.''
   Hazelwood said he thought his experience might drive other
tanker captains out of the business.
   ``Everything in your private life is paraded in public, and
you're lampooned from pillar to post. Is the job worth it? I still
haven't made up my mind. A lot of good people will leave the field
rather than risk this.''
   Hazelwood said he had pondered going into some other field,
perhaps even law given his exposure to it, as he waits nine months
to be eligible to reclaim his captain's license, issued in 1966.
   ``But I can't foresee myself putting on a pinstripe suit,
grabbing a bag and getting on the Long Island Rail Road every
day,'' he said. ``But I won't foreclose anything.''
   The Coast Guard offered no explanation for dismissing the charge
that Hazelwood was intoxicated during performance of his duties,
with a blood alcohol level over the Coast Guard's .04 percent limit.
   Also dismissed without explanation was a charge he left an
improperly licensed third mate in control of the ship.
   Hazelwood's attorney, Michael Chalos, disclosed during the
proceeding the defense recently found documents indicating that the
blood test taken 10{ hours after the spill was mishandled and
unreliable.
   In interviews, Hazelwood's lawyers said the tardy disclosure of
the alcohol records constituted misconduct by the Coast Guard and
the NTSB, which had access to the documents.
   The Coast Guard said the blood matter had nothing to do with the
plea agreement. The NTSB said in a statement the blood sample was
tested at certified labs and the NTSB had no control over the
results.
   Michael Peat, director of ChemWest Analytical Laboratories in
Sacramento, where the sample was analyzed, denied the specimens
were tampered with, but declined to elaborate.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher As Market Waits For Economic Data, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was higher in European trading late
this morning but dealers said they didn't expect any major movement
until Friday's release of U.S. economic data. Gold prices were
weaker in modest trading.
   Dealers said the dollar could move in either direction if there
were any surprises in Friday's second-quarter data on the U.S.
gross national product.
   Though some dealers said a general dollar bearishness persisted,
others said the currency might be headed for a small recovery after
recent declines, based on technical considerations.
   Some dealers also said a slight dollar rise was warranted
because of political turmoil in East Germany, which could have a
negative impact on the strength of the German mark.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.98 yen to a closing 150.11 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 150.55 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.6251 West German marks, up from 1.6170
   _1.3808 Swiss francs, up from 1.3715
   _5.4470 French francs, up from 5.4185
   _1.8312 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8215
   _1,189.25 Italian lire, up from 1,183.62
   _1.1522 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1518
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8088, down from
$1.8125 late Wednesday.
   Gold dealers in London fixed a recommended price of $370.60 a
troy ounce this morning, down from $373.25 bid late Wednesday.

   Police have again arrested one of three
lawyers authorities detained without charge for 20 days in a
crackdown on advocates of multiparty democracy, a police official
said today.
   The government of President Daniel arap Moi announced Wednesday
that it released Gitobu Imanyara as well as two other lawyers,
Mohamed Ibahim and John Khaminwa.
   However, Imanyara, who edits a monthly magazine often critical
of the government, was immediately rearrested ``in connection with
other criminal allegations against him,'' said Noah arap Too, head
of the Criminal Investigation Department.
   He said officials were questioning Imanyara, 37-year-old editor
of the Nairobi Law Monthly, which has served as a platform for the
advocates of political pluralism in this one-party East African
nation.
   ``If at the end of the day we don't find any evidence
(supporting the allegations), we will release him,'' otherwise, he
will be charged, said Too. He declined to discuss the case further.
   Imanyara, Ibrahim and Khaminwa were detained July 5 in a wave of
arrests that netted Kenya's most prominent proponents of multiparty
democracy.
   President Moi and other Kenyan leaders argue that more than one
political party could lead to war among the nation's approximately
40 tribes.
   Those still detained include former Cabinet ministers Charles
Rubia and Kenneth Matiba, and Raila Odinga, a businessman son of a
former vice president, Oginga Odinga.
   The government gave no reason for the lawyers' release. However,
clergymen, lawyers and foreign governments, including the United
States, had severely criticized the detentions.
   The detentions came two days before the date set by
pro-democracy forces for a rally to forward their cause.
   The government banned the July 7 rally, sparking riots in
Nairobi, four other major towns and rural areas, in which at least
28 people died and scores of others were injured.
   Kenyan law permits detention without charge or trial of
individuals considered a threat to state security.

   District Attorney Harry Connick said he was
ready to begin his re-election campaign after a federal jury
acquitted him of gambling and racketeering charges.
   The U.S. District Court jury on Wednesday also were acquitted
actor Paul Burke, former assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Fanning
and New Orleans businessman Wilson Abraham of similar charges.
   Three other men charged in the December indictment, accused
bookmaker Walton Aucoin, and two of his employees, Steve Bertolino
and William Condon, were convicted on two counts each of gambling
and racketeering.
   ``I really thought we shouldn't be here,'' Connick said after
the verdicts were returned. ``I didn't expect to be convicted.''
   Prosecutors claimed that Connick, at the urging of his three
acquitted co-defendants, illegally returned seized records to
Aucoin so the admitted bookie could pay off and collect gambling
debts.
   Connick maintained that Aucoin was entitled to have his gambling
records returned under state law. Aucoin said he needed them to pay
federal taxes on his gambling income.
   Before the trial started, Connick said the charges were
contrived by U.S. Attorney John Volz as part of a political
vendetta. Connick is a Democrat, Volz a Republican.
   Before the jury began deliberating the case Wednesday morning,
Connick, 63-year-old father of Grammy-winning jazz musician Harry
Connick Jr., went to Baton Rouge to qualify for re-election in the
Oct. 6 primary. He has been Orleans Parish district attorney since
1974.
   ``I'm ready to get on with campaigning,'' Connick said after the
verdicts. ``I don't think this will hurt my chances for
re-election. I think the people of New Orleans will know what was
going on here.''
   The indictment came after a yearlong investigation begun by
Volz, who later turned the case over to the Justice Department to
avoid any appearance of bias or conflict.
   Volz didn't answer his office telephone and he was not at home
Wednesday evening.

   Several men armed with baseball bats attacked a
group of Jewish youths before dawn today in the chic Opera district
of the capital, police sources and a French news agency reported.
   A reporter for Agence France-Presse said he was among several
witnesses to the attack, carried out by unidentified young men at
about 1 a.m.
   According to the agency, the attackers approached a parked car
containing an unspecified number of young Jewish men, recognizable
by their yarmulkes.
   The gang pulled the Jewish youths out of the car and clubbed
them, injuring at least two seriously enough to require emergency
treatment and hospitalization later, AFP reported. The attackers
fled, menacing bystanders with their bats.
   Police sources confirmed the AFP account and said two men were
later taken into custody and were being held pending identification
by witnesses to the attack. The specific motive for the attack was
not known.
   A wave of anti-Semitic vandalism followed the desecration in May
of a Jewish cemetery in Carpentras, where a corpse was dug up. The
incidents shocking the country and drew loud denunciations from
most political leaders about a perceived rise of anti-Semitic and
anti-immigrant feeling in France.

<DATELINE>CLAUSEN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A convoy of trucks today began
spiriting away a vast cache of deadly nerve gas once secretly
stored by the United States just outside this small West German
town.
   The snaking convoy removed the first batch of 100,000 gas-filled
artillery shells stored at a U.S. military site at Clausen, which
is near Kaiserslautern in the southwest part of the country.
   The lethal cargo, destined for destruction on a Pacific atoll,
is being removed under a 1986 U.S.-West German agreement at a cost
of $83.1 million.
   Hundreds of crack paramilitary West German police troops lined
the convoy route and stood guard on overpasses as the the long line
of 80 trucks began shuttling the shells at about 8 a.m.
   Vans carrying police with riot gear accompanied the convoy.
   The first trucks arrived at Miseau, about 30 miles away, 2{
hours later. At Miseau, the containers are to be loaded onto
special trains that will take them to Nordenham, on the North Sea,
where they will be placed aboard U.S. Navy ships for transport to
Johnston Atoll.
   The weapons will be destroyed in a specially built incinerator
on the U.S. atoll about 800 miles southwest of Hawaii.
   Only about 20 of the 80 trucks that left Clausen actually
carried the chemical weapons sealed in air-tight containers, said
U.S. Army spokesman Jim Boyle. He said the rest contained
decontamination crews, firefighters, West German and U.S. soldiers,
police, monitoring teams and medical staff.
   ``The chemical team is equipped to contain any incident,'' he
said. ``The operation is going as planned.''
   Only four protesters were spotted. They draped posters,
including one that said ``Evil is simply being shifted from here to
the Pacific,'' over a stone wall next a church along the convoy
route in Clausen.
   They said they were protesting the U.S. decision to destroy the
weapons on the atoll and said it would jeopardize the populace
there.
   ``This solution is the worst of all worlds,'' said protester
Ursula Siegmayer. She said she had participated in earlier chemical
weapons protests, ``But we're not proud of our success. This is a
catastrophe.''
   The West German government is paying $31.2 million of the
removal costs; the U.S. cost is $52 million.
   Environmental groups, which for years had campaigned for the
removal of the chemical weapons, had sought to block the transport,
charging that the safety measures were inadequate.
   The environmental Greens party, one of the strongest opponents
of chemical weapons, went to court to try to block the removal. But
an administrative court in Cologne ruled Friday there was no
evidence to prove the Greens' contention that faulty data had been
used to calculate the risk of transportation.
   Several groups of private citizens concerned about the safety of
the transport had also unsuccessfully tried to block the operation
through court action.
   ``The shells are safe to handle and transport due to their
construction and condition. The munitions, without fuses, are
double packed in vapor-proof secondary steel containers and
military vans for transport,'' the U.S. Army said in a statement
announcing the beginning of the operation.
   The approximately 100,000 artillery shells _ in 6-inch and
8-inch sizes _ are loaded with liquid nerve agents, according to
Boyle.
   They were brought to Clausen between 1958 and 1968, where they
have remained since.
   Clausen is the only site in West Germnay where chemical weapons
are stored.
   Boyle said the Army has done everything to make sure the
operation goes ahead without a hitch.
   ``There is safety measure upon safety measure redundant
throughout the operation,'' he said.
   One convoy will take the weapons daily from Clausen to Miesau
over the next 30 days.
   The rail transport to the North Sea port will take about a week
and will be conducted at night.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and former President Ronald
Reagan agreed in 1986 to remove the chemical weapons by 1992. The
timetable was advanced by President Bush.
   It was only in March that authorities acknowledged that the
chemical weapons were stored in Clausen.

<HEAD>What's in a Name? Ask Homer Simpson</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Homer Simpson is no longer bothered by the
question: ``What's in a name?''
   ``It's a big joke,'' the 36-year-old bar owner said. ``When I
try to order a pizza, cash a check, use a credit card, all kinds of
things, I usually get laughs.''
   The Madison man is the unlucky inheritor of one of the country's
most talked about names, shared with the patriarch of television's
``The Simpsons.''
   Things haven't been the same for Simpson since the animated
series began on the Fox network.
   Simpson said he was teased as a child because his name was
Homer, but he thought those days were over.
   ``The name was unusual _ kids looked for something to poke fun
at and there it was, but it blew over when I was 16 or 17,''
Simpson said. ``Then when the show came on, I said, `Oh no, here it
goes all over again.'''
   He has been featured in Time magazine, newspapers and on
television, and he gets a lot of telephone calls.
   ``At home, I get a lot of prank calls, usually from little
kids,'' Simpson said. ``I usually talk to them and tell them Bart's
outside playing around.''
   He's kidding. He really doesn't have a son name Bart like the
television Homer. His son's name is Chris, but his wife has the
same birthday as the animated guy.
   Simpson said he shares traits with his TV namesake, including
the nickname Moe. Both enjoy betting on football and go to dog
tracks.
   ``I started watching the show's credits because I thought it had
to be somebody I grew up with,'' he said. ``It was too strange.''
   Simpson said having a suddenly famous name has not been too
great a burden.
   ``It's been fun and there's been no harm done by it,'' he said.
``I've put up with being Homer Simpson all my life, so it really
doesn't bother me anymore.''

<TEXT>
   North and South Korea signed a historic
agreement today calling for their prime ministers to meet for the
first time in an effort to end four decades of Cold War
confrontation on the divided peninsula.
   Yet in a scenario which has become commonplace in inter-Korean
relations, the day ended in controversy, name-calling, and
dissidents shouting anti-Seoul government slogans near the border.
   The acrimony erupted over the aborted border crossing by five
North Korean civilians and threatened to spread a blight on today's
accord.
   The planned fall talks between the prime ministers would focus
on easing political and military tensions, promoting exchanges and
other moves toward cooperation between the two states formed 42
years ago.
   By signing the accord, North Korea's Communist government of Kim
Il Sung tacitly recognized the legitimacy of the Seoul government
of President Roh Tae-woo.
   ``This precious fruit will open a decisive chapter in a road to
ending national division and achieving peaceful unification,'' said
South Korean chief delegate Song Han-ho.
   North Korean chief delegate Paik Nam Jun said the agreement
``will open a new chapter in the history of the national division.''
   The 19-point accord was signed at the truce village of Panmunjom
located inside the 2{-mile-wide Demilitarized Zone which separates
the communist north from the capitalist south.
   The first prime ministers' talks would be held Sept. 4-7 in
Seoul. A second meeting is to be held Oct. 16-19 in the North
Korean capital of Pyongyang.
   The two prime ministers _ Kang Young-hoon of South Korea and Yon
Hyung Muk of North Korea _ are ceremonial figureheads with little
policy-making roles. But their meeting as the highest level ever
between the two rival states is seen as symbolically significant.
   Within an hour of the document's signing, however, the rival
Koreas became embroiled in disagreements over housing and travel
arrangements for five North Koreans who were to have crossed the
border today for a two-day visit in Seoul to plan a Korea-wide
rally for unification.
   Eight hours after the crossing was to take place, it was
effectively canceled. A communist official reportedly hung up the
phone during a conversation with a South Korean official. Shortly
thereafter, a North Korean radio broadcast blamed the south for
blocking its delegates.
   The Seoul government had insisted that the North Koreans stay in
a luxury Seoul hotel. The North Koreans wanted to stay with South
Korean dissidents at a church house _ and travel in the dissidents'
cars.
   Three disappointed South Korean dissidents waiting as a
welcoming party started chanting anti-government slogans. ``Down
with (President) Roh Tae-woo who blocks unification!'' they shouted.
   In Seoul, Unification Minister Hong Sung-chul issued a statement
saying ``all indications compel us to doubt if North Korea really
had any intentions to make (the crossing and) the rally come off as
scheduled.''
   He said ``our door remains open.''
   Lee Hae-hak, one of three South Korean dissident leaders at
Panmunjom, called it ``a political show.'' He said cancellations of
the North Koreans' visit would make it difficult to plan and hold
the unification rally that had been planned for Aug. 15.
   The five were to be the first civilians since a 1985 family
exchange to cross the border with the approval of both governments.
   Paik, the North Korean delegate, said if citizens on both sides
of the border have difficulty in arranging the rally, ``relations
of the south and north would further deteriorate and it would have
an irreparably bad impact on the holding of the high-level talks.''
   Proposed sites for the Aug. 15 rally include the capitals of
either North or South Korea or Panmunjom.
   The Koreas were divided after World War II. They fought a
three-year civil war that ended in 1953 and have remained rivals
since.
   Their border is the most heavily fortified in the world, with
more than 1.5 million armed men on either side.
   South Korea offered last week to open its border to North
Koreans for unrestricted travel for five days starting Aug. 13. It
challenged North Korea to do the same for South Koreans.
   The north has said it would open the border on a limited basis
on Aug. 15 to Koreans desiring unification.
   The two sides have become bogged down in a blitz of proposals
and conditions, and it remains unclear whether there will be any
crossings.
   Aug. 15 is the 45th anniversary of the liberation of Korea from
Japanese colonial rule. It is a sentimental holiday on both sides
of the border.

   With a blessing by Buddhist monks,
six sets of human remains were flown out of Cambodia today for
tests to see whether they are the bones of Americans missing from
the Vietnam War.
   It was the first time since the end of the war in 1975 that
communist Cambodia has allowed the repatriation of suspected
remains of those missing in action, or MIA.
   A somber American military honor guard escorted six flag-draped
aluminum caskets on board a U.S. Air Force C-141 that took off for
Hawaii, where the remains will undergo forensic examination to try
to identify them.
   Buddhist monks chanted prayers during a 15-minute memorial
service conducted before an altar covered with flowers and burning
incense. The six caskets sat behind the altar, and a monk sprinkled
holy water to bless the dead.
   ``The United States appreciates the support of the Phnom Penh
authorities for this undertaking,'' said Air Force Lt. Col. Thomas
Boyd, spokesman for the repatriation team. ``We consider this an
important humanitarian undertaking which, if successful, will help
to alleviate the suffering of American families.''
   The team had flown to Phnom Penh earlier today from Bangkok,
Thailand, to join the group of military experts who had examined 28
sets of remains collected by the Cambodians and chose six for
further tests.
   In Hawaii, the remains will be analyzed and identified by the
Joint Casualty Resolution Center and the Army Central
Identification Laboratory.
   The remains were given an initial examination by a six-man
military team in Phnom Penh on Tuesday and Wednesday _ the first
such MIA mission to Cambodia since the 1975 communist takeover.
   ``We came and did our work and the cooperation was everything we
asked for,'' Lt. Col. Joe Harvey, the U.S. team leader, told
reporters Wednesday after meeting with Dith Munty, first deputy
foreign minister of the Vietnamese-backed government.
   Harvey's team examined 28 sets of remains in a tiny laboratory
at Cambodia's only medical college. The teak caskets contained
bones, skulls and at least two sets of military identification
``dog tags.''
   A Cambodian Foreign Ministry spokesman said his government paid
$2,000 for the return of some remains from remote provinces.
   Harvey said six sets warranted further analysis in Hawaii.
   Two were found in outlying provinces and four were from Choeung
Ek, an area southwest of Phnom Penh that was used as a mass
execution ground by the fanatical Communist Khmer Rouge who ruled
from 1975 to 1978. The Khmer Rouge were ousted after Vietnamese
forces invaded Cambodia in late 1978.
   It was unclear if the remains found in Choeung Ek dated from the
period when the Khmer Rouge held power.
   Eighty-three American servicemen and eight U.S. civilians are
listed as missing in action in Cambodia from the Indochina war.
   The U.S. mission broke a long political stalemate between
Washington and successive communist governments in Phnom Penh over
the MIA issue.
   Boyd said past U.S. efforts to examine remains in Cambodia had
been ``either ignored or politicized.''
   He said Washington would consider sending another team to
examine more remains, but added that this was not discussed during
his group's visit.
   The United States does not recognize the Phnom Penh government.
But a week ago, it announced it was withdrawing recognition of the
Khmer Rouge-dominated guerrilla coalition that is fighting the
Phnom Penh government, and would open talks with Vietnam on ending
the Cambodian civil war.
   Cambodia's Deputy Interior Minister Khim Ponn, head of a newly
formed MIA commission, said he wanted to discuss normalization of
diplomatic relations. But the Americans limited talks to MIAs.
   Most of the Americans missing in Cambodia are airmen whose
planes were downed during bombing raids from 1969 to 1973 on the Ho
Chi Minh Trail, the major supply route for the North Vietnamese
into South Vietnam that wound through the mountains of eastern
Cambodia.
   A total of 2,300 Americans are officially listed as missing in
action in Indochina. Aside from those in Cambodia, 1,678 are
missing in Vietnam, 533 in Laos and six in China's coastal waters.

   Rival rebel groups are closing in on
the city from two directions in heavy fighting for control of the
capital.
   As the battles raged Wednesday, the airfield that was Monrovia's
last link to the outside world also came under attack.
   Fighters of rebel leader Charles Taylor resumed their offensive
in the eastern part of the city. Followers of a rival rebel
commander, Prince Johnson, fought off government soldiers who tried
to retake Bushrod Island in the north.
   With gunfire echoing all around, acting Information Minister
Paul Allen Wie told reporters that President Samuel Doe had no
plans to step down, despite the advancing armies.
   ``The president thinks it is worth dying for his country,'' Wie
said at a news conference at the Ducor Palace Hotel. He distributed
a news release quoting Doe as saying a sudden resignation ``would
lead to greater anarchy and ethnic tragedy in Liberia.''
   ``I cannot heed the advice ... to quit the leadership of Liberia
because it would introduce a dangerous precedent of outrageous
rebellion and instability into the West African region,'' Doe said.
   Early Wednesday, pro-Doe troops attacked two bridges that link
the city center with rebel-held Bushrod Island, but they were
repulsed by heavy fire.
   One squad of government soldiers was seen crawling across one of
the bridges but was pinned down under the heaviest gunfire yet
heard in the battle for the city.
   Some of the soldiers lay motionless as though dead or injured.
Others ran back to the safety of the government positions.
   Shells were also seen exploding on the other bridge, hitting a
government jeep which was trying to lead an attack from that side.
The wreckage of the jeep sat in the middle of the bridge.
   Government troops, firing from the city center, shelled rebel
positions on the far side of the bridges, some rounds falling close
to the city's main oil storage depot, which was in rebel hands.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said it appeared
Johnson's men controlled the island, which includes the port.
   Johnson is believed to have split with Taylor sometime in the
past three months, and some diplomats say his army is now stronger
than Taylor's National Patriotic Front.
   A few miles away to the east, rebels waded across a swamp and
attacked Spriggs-Payne Airfield, the last way out of the city that
was not in rebel hands. It was unclear whether fighters of Johnson
or Taylor launched the airfield attack.
   Further east in Paynesville, Taylor's men resumed their
offensive. Diplomats reported heavy fighting in that area, where
the rebels had been blocked several weeks by government soldiers.
   Diplomats said Taylor's forces surrounded and effectively
neutralized government troops who were barricaded inside the radio
and television stations east of the city. The rebels did not attack
them in order to spare the facilities, the diplomats said.
   The government, which the rebels accuse of corruption and human
rights abuses, repeated its allegation the United States was
actively aiding the insurgents.
   The United States has denied the accusation, and Boucher said
its offer to provide safe passage out of the country for Doe stood.
Doe met Tuesday with U.S. Ambassador Peter De Vos but did not ask
for help in leaving the country, Boucher said at a Washington
briefing.
   ``The Liberian people are disappointed by the United States,''
Wie told the reporters.
   Doe expelled the chief of the U.S. Military Mission to Liberia,
Col. David Staley, on Friday after accusing him of actively
supporting the rebels.
   On Tuesday, the government accused the United States of
launching an attack on Doe's presidential mansion from a submarine,
a charge immediately denied by Washington.
   People who said they witnessed the attack said it came from a
rebel gunboat offshore. The fortified mansion returned the fire and
later announced that five civilians were killed on a nearby main
road.
   Monrovians continued their desperate search for food and water
in a city where all shops were closed and where utilities have been
shut down for more than a month.
   As many as 5,000 people were jammed into a U.S.-owned fuel
storage depot near the embassy, in the exclusive Mamba Point
district, seeking haven from attacks by soldiers who were going on
looting sprees and attacking civilians.
   Most government soldiers are members of Doe's Krahn tribe. Since
the insurgency began in December, they have attacked civilian
members of the Gio and Mano tribes, which provide the main support
for Taylor.
   Sixteen ambassadors met with the acting foreign minister
Wednesday to complain about being harassed by troops at checkpoints
throughout the city.

<HEAD>New Repairs Planned For Freeways Damaged By Quake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two quake-ravaged freeways will remain
closed six months later than planned because of revised design and
construction changes on the elevated roadways.
   Director Robert Best of the state Department of Transportation
said Wednesday an independent, private panel of engineers
discovered more construction work was needed to cope with
disaster-type stresses on the Central and Interstate 280 freeways.
   Two weeks ago, officials said the freeways, which carry 250,000
vehicles a day, would reopen in October.
   The freeways resemble the Cypress Freeway that collapsed in
Oakland during the Oct. 17 earthquake. The quake measured 7.1 on
the Richter scale, killed 67 people and caused an estimated $7
billion in damage. The new freeways are expected to withstand a
quake registering 8.2 on the Richter scale.
   Nicholas Forell, chairman of the independent review panel, said
repair work on the elevated roadways involves ``an immense
engineering task.
   ``There is no precedent to these freeways anywhere in the
world,'' Forell said.
   About $5 million of $39 million in original repair contracts on
the two freeways has been spent to date, Best said. The revised
plans could bring costs to $80 million, he said.
   Asked why work was started before all engineering reviews were
in, Best said, ``We did that to try to expedite the reopenings ...
we felt there was a good chance that work could be accommodated by
getting the contracting going.
   ``We were taking a gamble to get these facilities opened a few
months earlier than if we had waited.''

   Gov. Buddy Roemer said his belief in
free speech led him to veto a bill that would have required warning
labels on recordings that some say promote deviant behavior.
   The Democratic governor also planned to announce Friday whether
he would veto the nation's strictest state abortion bill.
   Roemer vetoed the record labeling bill Wednesday as he was
flanked by supporters that included Tipper Gore, president of a
parents organization that pushed for voluntary labeling, and Jason
Berman, president of the Recording Industry Association of America.
   The bill would have mandated labels for recordings with themes
of rape, murder, suicide, incest, illegal drug use, child abuse and
satanic worship. It also would have prohibited the sale of such
recordings to people under age 17.
   Retailers, manufacturers and distributors of recordings would
have been subject to possible six-month jail terms and $5,000 fines.
   Musicians and recording industry officials had threatened to
boycott Louisiana if Roemer signed the bill, but he denied the
pressure influenced his decision.
   ``As a parent and as a governor, this legislation has presented
to me my most severe philosophical conflict,'' Roemer told
reporters. ``My strong belief about decency in the proper
upbringing of my own children versus my strong belief and
dedication to freedom of speech ... and my innate desire to avoid
excessive governmental interference.''
   There also is pressure for Roemer to veto the abortion bill. He
said he received a letter signed by law professors from Harvard,
Yale, Georgetown, Stanford and other universities who concluded
that ``there is virtually no chance that this particular bill would
be sustained by the United States Supreme Court.''
   The bill, passed in the last days of the Legislature this month,
would prohibit abortions except to save the life of the mother or
for cases of incest and rape. Doctors performing abortions could be
sentenced to up to 10 years in prison and fined $100,000.
   Roemer declined to say whether he plans to veto the abortion
bill Friday or allow it to become law without his signature.
   In 1985 when Mrs. Gore, wife of Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn.,
helped organize U.S. Senate hearings on record labeling, various
record company executives said they planned to label records that
contained explicit lyrics.
   State Rep. Ted Haik, the sponsor of the Louisiana bill, said the
music industry can't be trusted.
   ``He apparently has learned nothing from the past experiences of
broken promises of the music industry to develop a uniform labeling
system,'' Haik said of the governor.
   Elton John, Ray Charles, Randy Newman, Patti LaBelle and other
performers protested the bill. The Neville Brothers, favorite sons
in Louisiana, called the bill racist and threatened to stop
performing in their home state.
   The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences threatened
to end consideration of New Orleans as a site for the Grammy Hall
of Fame if the bill became law. Music industry organizations
threatened to cancel planned conventions in the city.
   Radio stations had ``label day'' marathons, playing records that
disc jockeys thought would fall under the ban. Among them were such
classics as ``Stagger Lee,'' ``House of the Rising Sun,'' ``Love
For Sale,'' and ``Mack the Knife.''
   In May, the recording industry unveiled a voluntary labeling
system that it hoped would halt state campaigns for mandatory
labeling.
   ``We believe this voluntary system responsibly addresses the
parental concerns without crossing over the line that results in
unconstitutional limits on freedoms of expression,'' Berman said.
``This industry-wide standard logo provides an easily recognizable
tool to assist parents who wish to monitor the music their children
are buying.''

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq has agreed to pull thousands of troops
back from its disputed border with Kuwait, diplomatic sources say,
after apparently forcing Kuwait to agree to end oil overproduction.
   Today, Iraqi newspapers suddenly ceased what had been daily
attacks on Kuwait, and an Iraqi official confirmed that Iraqi and
Kuwait representatives would open talks this weekend in the Saudi
Arabian port of Jiddah.
   But the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
President Saddam Hussein has not backed down on demands that Kuwait
cut oil production, pay for oil Baghdad claims was pumped illegally
from a field that straddles the countries' undemarcated border and
forgive billions of dollars in loans.
   ``The ball is in the Kuwaiti court now,'' he said.
   Diplomatic sources said late Wednesday that tens of thousands of
troops reportedly sent to the border earlier this week by Saddam
would begin withdrawing today.
   In Geneva, where OPEC was holding a mid-year meeting, Iraq's oil
minister denied there had even been a troop buildup, as published
reports and diplomats had said. ``There is no such thing as massing
of troops along the border,'' said Issam Abdul Rahim al-Chalabi.
   Oil-rich Iraq, with a $70 billion foreign debt after a fall in
crude prices and a costly war with Iran, last week threatened
military action against fellow oil producers Kuwait and the United
Arab Emirates for contributing to the overproduction that has
driven down the price of crude.
   Iraq has 17 million people, including 1 million soldiers. Kuwait
has 1.8 million residents, 20,300 in the armed forces. The U.A.E.
has about 1.6 million residents and a military with about 43,000
personnel.
   In Geneva, OPEC oil cartel members this week are trying to put a
lid on production to drive up the price, and officials from Kuwait
and the U.A.E. indicated Wednesday that they are ready to go along.
   That agreement, along with mediation efforts by Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and other Arab leaders, appears to have
reduced tensions considerably.
   The Persian Gulf sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Kuwait had insisted that Iraq withdraw the forces it
reportedly massed on the countries' 100-mile border before it would
negotiate this weekend with Baghdad.
   They credited intensive mediation Tuesday and Wednesday week by
Mubarak and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.
   The announcement of direct Iraqi-Kuwaiti talks was made by
Mubarak on Wednesday in Cairo even as the Iraqi media stepped up an
anti-American campaign in response to U.S. military muscle-flexing
in the Persian Gulf.
   The Pentagon had announced Tuesday that U.S. warships and
aircraft were holding a ``short-notice exercise'' in the Persian
Gulf with the U.A.E., a clear show of support for the two small
states challenged by Baghdad.
   In Baghdad, Saddam summoned U.S. Ambassador April Glaspie for
talks on Wednesday. Government radio gave no details of the meeting.
   In Kuwait, diplomatic sources said Saddam had assured Mubarak he
would not use military force as long as Kuwait agrees to the
following conditions: paying compensation for $2.4 billion in oil
Iraq claims Kuwait stole, and holding direct talks on a border
dispute.
   The oil allegedly stolen was from the Rumaila oil field, which
straddles the border. Iraq claims Rumaila is exclusively its own.
   In addition, Iraq wants Kuwait to write off billions of dollars
in loans it granted Iraq during the 8-year Iran-Iraq war that ended
in August 1988. It also wants the reopening of a border air
corridor.
   The dispute flared last week when a bellicose-sounding Iraq
accused Kuwait of stealing the oil and alleged that Kuwait and the
U.A.E. were causing a slump in oil prices by exceeding their OPEC
production quotas.
   Baghdad's move was widely interpreted as seeking to pressure the
two small states into agreeing at this week's meeting of the
13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to a
proposal to cut oil output.

<TEXT>
   A disease that can cause kidney failure has been
arrested in rats by an experimental drug, raising hopes for a new
human therapy, researchers said today.
   The disease, called glomerulonephritis, strikes perhaps 100,000
Americans a year, researcher Dr. Wayne Border said.
   A medication like the one used in the experiment may someday be
able to stop the disease's progression, so patients wouldn't need
dialysis or transplants, he said.
   Such a treatment may also work for a similar kidney complication
of diabetes and high blood pressure, Border, a kidney specialist at
the University of Utah School of Medicine, said in an interview.
   The rat study was published today in the British journal Nature.
   The work raises ``exciting possibilities'' in a new line of
research, said Dr. Ira Greifer, professor of pediatrics and
nephrology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and
Montefiore Medical Center in New York.
   Existing drugs don't always work and can produce major side
effects, he said.
   But it will take more research to determine what the new
approach means for treating human disease, cautioned Dr. Lawrence
Agodoa of the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney
Diseases.
   Glomerulonephritis (pronounced glo-MER-u-low-neh-FRI-tis) is an
inflammatory process that can destroy ball-shaped kidney structures
called glomeruli. The structures help remove wastes from the
bloodstream. If destruction is extensive enough, wastes can
accumulate in the bloodstream and cause death.
   Glomerulonephritis can appear by itself or in conjunction with a
chronic disease called lupus, strep throat or a variety of
infections.
   The researchers gave rats a form of glomerulonephritis by making
the rats' disease-fighting immune system attack the glomeruli.
Although the cause of the human disease is not well understood,
such an attack frequently appears to play a key role, they said.
   Then they injected some of the rats with proteins called
antibodies that would seek out and latch onto a natural substance
called transforming growth factor beta. Previous studies suggested
that this substance stimulates the glomeruli to produce a protein
meshwork that leads to destructive scarring.
   The scientists reasoned that if the antibodies could bind to the
growth factor and disable it, the production of the meshwork might
stop.
   Agodoa said nobody has yet shown that the growth factor plays a
role in human glomerulonephritis.
   Greifer said he doubted the work would apply to kidney scarring
caused by high blood pressure, because that scarring comes from a
different process.
   Other researchers in the study were Selya Okuda of the Utah
medical school, Erkki Ruoslahti and Lucia Languino of the La Jolla
Cancer Research Foundation in La Jolla, Calif., and Michael Sporn
of the National Cancer Institute.

<TEXT>
   It might have been a tribute to an honored
elder statesman, so lavish was the praise _ and not the unanimous
condemnation of a senator for deliberately breaking Senate rules.
   The Senate voted 96-0 Wednesday to denounce Sen. Dave
Durenberger for financial wrongdoing. But first, senators called
the Minnesota Republican a man of conscience, of influence, of
decency. Afterward they lined up to hug him, shake his hand and pat
his shoulder.
   He is, after all, one of them.
   And, as Sen. Bill Armstrong, R-Colo., put it, ``After this is
all over and we denounce him, we still want him to be our friend.''
   Durenberger was disciplined for violating Senate speaking fee
and gift limits, misleading the Senate on real estate transactions
involving his Minneapolis condominium and converting a campaign
contribution to personal use.
   The Senate also ordered him to make restitution of up to
$123,000 for money he received improperly. Durenberger has agreed
to repay the money.
   The judgment marked the 24th time in 201 years that the Senate
disciplined one of its own. The main case against him was made by
Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., chairman of the Ethics Committee.
   ``I wish there was ambiguity here, but there is none. I wish I
could find innocence, or at most inadvertence, or inattention, or
simple ignorance in Sen. Durenberger's actions here, but I
cannot,'' Heflin said somberly.
   Durenberger sat nearly impassive through the three hours of
emotional remarks, clasping his hands tightly at times and staring
intently at each senator who spoke.
   The debate was unusually personal, with senators referring
frequently to Durenberger simply by his first name. And the chamber
was unusually full, with all committee business suspended for the
solemn proceeding.
   Durenberger made his reputation building bridges among senators,
politically and personally, and many of them indicated they could
not forget that as they struggled with their duty.
   ``As senators we must unflinchingly exercise the judgment which
is required,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. ``As a human being, I
remain a steadfast friend of Dave Durenberger's and an admirer of
the legislative work he has accomplished.''
   Several senators said they found it hard to reconcile the
evidence with the cheerful, capable man who for 12 years has played
major roles in legislation affecting the disabled, minorities, the
elderly, rural communities, the environment and health care.
   ``We all know what happened. Some of us watched it with startled
mien,'' said Republican Whip Alan Simpson of Wyoming. ``I still
cannot understand,'' said Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., vice chairman
of the ethics panel.
   Durenberger has said his judgment was impaired by family
problems _ the death of his first wife, a troubled remarriage, four
sons going through difficult adolescences and tremendous financial
stress.
   But Rudman said none of that could excuse his conduct. And
Durenberger, looking him in the eye from across the aisle, nodded
solemnly in agreement.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, noted with approval Durenberger's
``resolve to reform,'' a theme that suffused the Minnesotan's brief
floor remarks after the vote.
   He vowed to be a better man, a better senator. He said he would
work harder, shoulder more responsibility. He called the moment an
ending but also a beginning. ``I ask your forgiveness,'' he said.
``I need your friendship.''
   Later, Durenberger said his decision to ``take my medicine'' and
forge onward rather than resign was due to strong support from his
colleagues. He said their comments Wednesday ``caused me to believe
that if anything, I'll be even more effective'' in the future.
   Durenberger, who has four years before he must face voters back
home, was not the only one who saw good coming from his ordeal.
   ``He could have withered and fallen into self-pity and
bitterness,'' said Simpson. Instead, he said, ``I have seen my
friend soften and mature and grow in this terrible process.''
   ``Sometimes hard times bring people together,'' said Sen. David
Pryor, D-Ark., a member of the ethics panel. He said the Senate has
not always been congenial lately, but ``today I sense a sense of
feeling together, a sense of closeness and a sense of brotherhood.''

<HEAD>Gorbachev Says Aid Necessary for Perestroika</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today his
country needs Western assistance to make his reform program work,
and he promised that any aid will be repaid.
   Gorbachev spoke at a news conference after a day of meetings
with Italian Premier Giulio Andreotti, the president of the
European Community. Andreotti is a leading proponent of providing
aid to the Soviet Union.
   No agreements were reached in the talks about Italian or
European aid to boost Gorbachev's reform program.
   Gorbachev said the Soviet Union needs help producing more food
and consumer goods for the market, and that factories need a chance
to work with foreign firms to boost their productivity.
   As an example of Soviet inefficiency, Gorbachev has said 25
percent of the nation's crops are lost during harvesting and
storage.
   The resident of the Russian Federation, the Soviet Union's
largest republic, today warned of a food shortage ``catastrophe''
in Russia unless efficiency improves.
   ``We have to gather it carefully, preserve it and get it onto
the table of the Russian people,'' Boris N. Yeltsin said.
   ``The existing food situation in our republic is critical,'' he
said in an appeal on the front page of the Sovietskaya Rossia
newspaper. ``To prevent a catastrophe, we must improve it
immediately.''
   As an incentive, Yeltsin said the government would issue special
coupons to agricultural workers, from farmers to tractor drivers,
allowing them to buy goods that have been in short supply.
   Russian Prime Minister Ivan Silayev warned in a separate
interview that if the market is not soon saturated with food and
consumer goods ``the situation will be unpredictable.''
   ``The prices will simply skyrocket and the shadow economy will
capture everything,'' he told Pravitelstvenny Vestnik newspaper.
   Gorbachev said the next two years of reforms will be crucial.
   ``In these two years, in which we will have to make the most
difficult changes, we need this kind of help,'' Gorbachev said.
   Some of the aid should be given quickly ``to reduce the
difficulty of the problems, and so perestroika does not slow
down,'' he said.
   However, he added, the Soviet Union ``cannot depend on foreign
sponsors'' to fix its economy, but must depend largely on itself.
Aid to his country will not be ``a handout,'' he said, but
temporary assistance that must be paid back.
   The West German government has guaranteed $3.1 billion in bank
loans to the Soviet Union, and together with France it pushed the
European Community to endorse an immediate $15 billion aid program.
   But European leaders refused to go along with the plan, as did
leaders of the world's seven largest capitalist powers meeting in
Houston, Texas, earlier this month.
   President Bush says a program to provide the Soviet Union with
Western advisers and know-how would be of greater benefit than
economic aid until the Soviet Union makes greater changes in its
economy. He also has asked Gorbachev to cut aid to countries like
Cuba.

   A U.S. District Court jury on Wednesday found Dennis Daniels
guilty on charges of endangering a bus with reckless disregard for
people's safety and use of a firearm.
   Daniels, 42, faces up to 20 years in prison and $250,000 fine on
the first count, and a mandatory five years in prison and a maximum
fine of $250,000 for use of a firearm.
   He was free on $50,000 bond, pending sentencing.
   Daniels was convicted of firing shots March 9 at a

   This is a list of the nine senators who have
been denounced, condemned or censured by their colleagues.
   Senate historians say the sanction, which requires a majority
vote of the full Senate, is the most severe punishment short of
expulsion. Denouncement, condemnation and censure are different
terms for the same sanction.
   _Dave Durenberger, R-Minn. Denounced July 25, 1990, for
financial misconduct.
   _Herman E. Talmadge, D-Ga. Denounced in 1979 for financial
misconduct with an aide, including improper collection of
reimbursements.
   _Thomas J. Dodd, D-Conn. Censured in 1967 for spending campaign
funds for personal use.
   _Joseph R. McCarthy, R-Wis. Condemned in 1954 for obstructing
the legislative process and insulting senators.
   _Hiram Bingham, R-Conn. Censured in 1929 for hiring employee of
state manufacturers association to help him with tariff legislation.
   _John L. McLaurin, D-S.C., and Benjamin R. Tillman, D-S.C.
Censured in 1902 for fighting on the Senate floor.
   _Benjamin Tappan, D-Ohio. Censured May 10, 1844, for releasing

<HEAD>Baker Begins Asian Trip; Says No Agreement Yet on Afghanistan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
today sought to reduce speculation that an agreement with the
Soviet Union on Afghanistan could be announced during his
four-nation visit to Asia.
   ``There's no agreement on Afghanistan,'' Baker was quoted as
telling reporters on his plane to Jakarta. ``It's a product of the
rumor mill.''
   The U.S. Embassy in Jakarta released a statement with the Baker
comments.
   Prior to Baker's departure, U.S. officials had indicated the
secretary of state would try to clear the remaining roadblocks to a
cease-fire in Afghanistan during the Asian trip.
   They said Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, who are to meet Aug. 1 meeting in Irkutsk, Soviet
Siberia, would discuss a timetable for Afghanistan's President
Najibullah to step down.
   ``The Soviets hinted at a deal; they haven' fleshed it out,'' an
administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Tuesday. ``The thread of the deal is going to be pursued in Irkutsk
by Baker.''
   ABC News had said earlier this week that Shevardnadze and Baker
already had made a deal to end the Afghan civil war, but the
administration official disputed that report.
   The Bush administration has been hoping for a breakthrough to
end the war between Afghan government forces armed by the Soviet
Union and a guerrilla coalition fighting with American-supplied
weapons funneled through Pakistan.
   The Soviets have not yet told the United States how Najibullah
might be removed from power in Kabul, said the administration
official.
   The Soviet Union installed the Najibullah government in 1979,
but the government in Kabul has been unable to impose its will on
the countryside. The Soviets withdrew their troops last year but
continue to supply arms.
   In Indonesia, Baker will attend a meeting of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations on Friday and Saturday.
   ASEAN said in a statement Wednesday that a change in Cambodia's
representation in the United Nations would hurt the search for
peace in Indochina. Last week, the United States withdrew its
recognition of the guerrilla coalition that holds Cambodia's U.N.
General Assembly seat.
   Baker was quoted as telling reporters on the plane that the
change of U.S. policy on Cambodia was ``an example of our need to
adjust to new circumstances.''
   Washington also announced last week it would open talks with
Vietnam on a settlement in Cambodian and would no longer support
the right of the guerrilla coalition to represent Phnom Penh in the
world body.
   Those steps could open the way to a broader rapprochement
between the United States and Hanoi, shifting the balance of power
in Southeast Asia. Hanoi supports the Cambodian govenment.
   The abrupt U.S. policy change underlined the failure of years of
ASEAN-led diplomacy to negotiate a settlement. ASEAN helped form
the Cambodian resistance group in 1982.
   U.S. officials said the shift was designed to prevent the Khmer
Rouge, the strongest of the three guerrilla groups, from gaining
power in Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge took power in 1975 and
slaughtered hundreds of thousands of civilians before being ousted
by Vietnam in 1978.
   ASEAN includes Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia,
Indonesia and Brunei. Later in the Asian trip, Baker will later
hold talks in Singapore and visit Outer Mongolia.

   Mushrooms don't grow in New York, they die. Nine
mushrooms _ street slang for bystanders who pop up during gunfights
_ have been killed this year, including a 3-year-old boy who was
shot as he slept this morning.
   ``The people in the streets don't care. To them, shooting is
normal. Everybody has a gun. The law? That's irrelevant,'' said
Thomas Reppetto, head of the watchdog Citizens' Crime Commission.
   Repetto spoke Wednesday, just a few hours before Yaritimi Fruto
died at Brookdale Hospital Medical Center in Brooklyn. The girl,
who celebrated her first birthday last Friday, was shot Tuesday by
the same gun that killed her father.
   Her shooting came two days after 9-year-old Veronica Corales was
mortally wounded by a bullet to the head as she slept in her
parents' car after a trip to Great Adventure amusement park in New
Jersey. Veronica died Tuesday at Brookdale shortly before Yaritimi
arrived.
   And at about 4 a.m. today, a 3-year-old whose name was withheld
by police was fatally shot above the right eye as he slumbered in
the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn. Police said a gunfight had
broken out between shooters outside and inside the boy's building.
   ``They're in the way, underfoot, so let's squash 'em down.
That's the way they feel about innocent bystanders in New York City
in 1990,'' said Reppetto, a former police officer.
   ``It's not something recent. It's just getting more attention.
It's becoming more common, and it will grow,'' he said.
   More and more bystanders are getting shot around the city,
statistics show. Reppetto cited a study by his group that showed
the number of bystanders shot in New York City quadrupled between
1978 and 1988.
   A University of Maryland professor of criminology, Lawrence W.
Sherman, did a study that showed a jump in the slayings of
bystanders every year from 1985 through 1988. The number in the
first year was five; in the last, it was 12. This year's total is
running slightly ahead of that: nine in seven months, police said.
   The shootings have left survivors anxious to get away from the
violence which has produced record murder counts in each of the
last two years, with a new high expected in 1990.
   Veronica's uncle, Willy Cosme, blamed it on the neighborhood.
``Growing up around here, other little kids often learn the bad
side of life,'' he said. The Brooklyn police precinct where
Veronica's family lives is the deadliest in the city, with 97
murders in 1989.
   ``New York is so crazy now,'' said Berkley Tatum, whose
18-year-old son was shot to death Tuesday on his way to the grocery
store. ``People have no values ... Why would anyone want to stand
on a roof, fire a gun at an innocent kid in a car? It's all over.
The city is finished.''

   A Syrian army fuel truck that apparently
lost its brakes crashed into the lobby of a hotel in this eastern
Lebanese town, touching off a fire that killed seven people and
injured 11, police said today.
   The truck rolled downhill out of control into the Kassouf Hotel
on Wednesday night, said a police spokesman, who cannot be named in
line with regulations.
   He said the truck ``blew up into a ball of fire that blazed
across the hotel's four floors. Most of the victims were sleeping
in their rooms when the accident took place.''
   The dead included the hotel owner and her two sons and the
driver of the truck, police said.
   The fire gutted the hotel's first two floors, blackened the rest
of the building and turned eight vehicles in the parking lot into
piles of twisted metal.
   Initial reports on local radio stations had said 45 people were
killed, but after the confusion died down, authorities gave the
lower death toll.
   The injured were admitted to hospitals in the nearby Bekaa
valley town of Zahleh for treatment of burns and cuts, police said.
The spokesman said none of the injured was in critical condition.
   Chtaura, 20 miles east of Beirut, is a shopping town on the main
highway linking Lebanon with Syria, the main supply route for
Syrian troops based in Lebanon.
   The police spokesman said fire engines and civil defense teams
fought the blaze for several hours before extinguishing it at about
4 a.m.
   Syria has 40,000 troops deployed in east and north Lebanon as
well as Beirut and part of the mountainous range southeast of the
capital under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League.

<TEXT>
   Negotiators for El Salvador and
leftist guerrillas agreed today to have a U.N. commission monitor
human rights in El Salvador, where tens of thousands of civilians
have died in the civil war.
   The accord was reached after an all-night negotiating session in
San Jose. The talks turned to the human rights issue after failing
to make progress on a cease-fire in the decade-old war. The
commission would not begin work until a cease-fire agreement is
reached.
   Nevertheless, negotiators said the rights accord was a
significant step. It was the first concrete agreement between the
sides since peace talks began in May, and both delegations had
expressed concern that the absence of an accord in the San Jose
talks might deal a devastating blow to the negotiating process.
   Salvadoran guerrillas have long accused the rightist government
of human rights abuses, and human rights groups say at least 30,000
people have died at the hands of right-wing death squads.
   The latest victims include six Jesuit priests, their cook and
her 16-year-old daughter, who were shot to death early Nov. 16 at
Central American University.
   ``The accord reached today between the government of El Salvador
and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front rebels doesn't
close the topic of human rights, but it is a partial accord,'' said
Alvaro de Soto, a U.N. mediator.
   De Soto said the accord ``without doubt helps clear the way for
progress on other items of the agenda.''
   ``We're enormously satisfied,'' said Oscar Santamaria, the
justice minister and chief of the government delegation. ``This
accord is a very meaningful advance.''
   Guerrilla commander Schafik Handal, leader of the rebel
negotiating team, said the document ``is an accord of great value.''
   But he cautioned that the issue of overhauling the armed forces
was still pending. ``This (human rights) accord will not mean a
great deal unless we advance in the field of demilitarization of
Salvadoran society,'' he said.
   The talks began Friday, and the top agenda item was the overhaul
of the armed forces, which the rebels have demanded before they
stop fighting. During 20 hours of talks, negotiators failed to make
even slight progress on that issue.
   It was the third round of talks this year aimed at ending the
conflict that has killed 72,000 people, most of them civilians.
   The massacre of the Jesuits focused new attention on the
civilian toll. It stunned the world and prompted calls from some
U.S. politicians to reconsider aid to the El Salvadoran government,
which stands at $1 million a day.
   Several soldiers were arrested in the case, but they have not
been brought to trial. No officer has ever been convicted of human
rights abuses in El Salvador.
   The U.N. mission will be headed by an appointee of U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and will comprise ``as
many agents as are necessary.''
   ``The mission will enjoy broad powers to adopt any initiative it
deems appropriate for the promotion and defense of human rights,''
said a joint communique.
   It said the mission will be free to document and denounce rights
violations; conduct unrestricted interviews with all people; make
recommendations to both the government and guerrillas; and publish
its reports, conclusions and recommendations.
   The mission is to begin work as soon as a cease-fire is reached.
   The government said the accord was a big step toward fulfilling
requirements for a cessation of hostilities, and they demanded the
rebels modify their positions in order to meet a September target
date for a cease-fire.
   But the insurgents insist that accords on military issues _
including a purge of rights abusers from the officer corps, an end
to military impunity and drastic reduction of troop strength _ be
reached prior to halting combat. Rebel chiefs say a September
cease-fire may be unrealistic.
   A joint communique said the military issue would receive
``priority consideration'' at the next round of talks, scheduled
Aug. 17-22 in San Jose.

   Relief supplies still have not
reached some areas cut off by landslides triggered by the
devastating July 16 earthquake, Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said
today.
   The relief effort has also been hampered by logistical problems
and quarreling over supplies, said Ramos, who is chairman of the
National Disaster Coordinating Council.
   ``The uneven distribution of goods comes from competition at the
community level as to who should get the relief goods,'' he said.
``Sometimes the relief goods intended ... to reach a certain family
does not get to that family because of some misdelivery along the
way.''
   Ramos said he had ordered an investigation of why some supplies
had failed to reach their destination. The defense chief also said
relief efforts were focusing on northern towns accessible only by
helicopter because of landslides.
   According to the latest figures, the earthquake left at least
1,653 people dead, more than 1,000 missing and presumed dead, more
than 3,000 seriously injured and nearly 90,000 homeless.
   Officials estimated today that property damage totaled $903
million, an amount that was expected to increase. The quake, which
measured 7.7 on the Richter scale, was the strongest to strike the
Philippines in 14 years.
   Government officials moved to seek a suspension of debt payments
so the Philippines can devote more resources to earthquake relief.
The nation has a $26 billion foreign debt.
   Rep. Margarito Teves, a member of the government's Foreign Debt
Council, said today that the Philippines would try to negotiate a
2{-year debt-payment moratorium with its chief creditors, the
14-nation Paris Club. The Paris Club includes the United States,
Japan, France, West Germany and Britain.
   President Corazon Aquino's Cabinet agreed Wednesday to seek a
moratorium after some lawmakers began pushing for a unilateral halt
in debt repayment. The Aquino government opposes such a move.

<TEXT>
   A teacher who accidentally killed a tardy student
by closing the school gate as the girl tried to squeeze through
will be fired, education authorities decided today.
   They also agreed to discipline five other education officials in
connection with the case, which raised widespread criticism of the
rigidity in many Japanese schools.
   On July 6, Toshihiko Hosoi closed the front gate of Hyogo
Prefectural Takatsuka Senior High School in Kobe, 270 miles west of
Tokyo, promptly at 8:30 a.m. in an effort to teach students a
lesson about coming to school on time.
   Ryoko Ishida, 15, was caught in the heavy metal gate and died of
a crushed skull.
   The school had a policy of closing the gate at 8:30 each
morning. Published accounts of the incident differ, but most say
the teacher closed the gate suddenly to teach the students a lesson
about being late.
   The prefectural education board decided today to fire the
teacher because he failed to take adequate safety measures. Police
are questioning the teacher on suspicion of professional negligence.
   The high school principal, Atsuo Nomura, also resigned under
pressure today, and the Hyogo prefecture board of education
cautioned the school's head teacher and the prefectural
superintendent of education and gave ``serious notice'' to two vice
superintendents of education.
   Commentator Morse Saito, writing in the Mainichi Shimbun, said
the Kobe high school's strict gate-closing rule was meant to give
students with bad grades a way to win job recommendations.
   ``By graduation, (teachers) could recommend most students as
being prompt even though some had low grades. This is important for
(students) seeking employment after high school. The elite don't
need it,'' he wrote.
   Discipline also often includes corporal punishment, according to
Morikatsu Imahashi, a professor at Ibaraki University and a
longtime corporal punishment opponent. ``Teachers often slap,
punch, kick,'' he said in an interview.
   In September, teachers buried two junior high school students in
Fukuoka, a city on the southern island of Kyushu, in sand up to
their necks. Media reports said the teachers suspected the students
of bullying their classmates.

   ``Wine heah! Get your ice cold chardonnay!''
   Sure, it sounds unlikely, but it won't be illegal in New York
state much longer. Soon, ballpark vendors will be allowed to hawk
Pouilly Fuisse with the peanuts or Chateau Lafite with the
crackerjack.
   A law legalizing wine sales at ballparks and racetracks was
signed Wednesday by Gov. Mario Cuomo. It's aimed at boosting sales
for New York's struggling wineries, officials said.
   The law goes into effect in three months.
   Nobody's popping corks at New York's two baseball stadiums,
where team representatives say they don't expect much demand for
wine at ballgames.
   ``I wouldn't even know how to serve Chablis. Chilled, right?''
said Joel White, head of customer services for the Yankees.
   Wine coolers, which have already boosted New York's grape sales
40 percent since they were legalized, ``have pulled the grape
industry right out of the doldrums,'' said Assemblyman Vincent
Graber of Buffalo.
   Maybe so, but will they give fans new reason to head the
ballparks?
   ``Maybe this is something for the tennis crowd,'' White said.
``They're much more chi-chi than our fans.''

burning, said Marc Kaiser, deputy director of Disaster and

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court today fined the magazine Private
Eye and its editor $18,100 each for publishing articles that
prosecutors said could have affected the outcome of the notorious
Yorkshire Ripper murder case.
   They also alleged the articles were intended to discourage the
defendant's wife from pursuing a libel case against the satirical
magazine.
   Lord Justice Roger Parker, speaking for a three-judge panel,
said: ``I regard it as of the greatest importance that it should be
clear that articles of this nature within a short time of trial are
not to be tolerated.''
   Outside court, Private Eye editor Ian Hislop said: ``I'm
disappointed. We will pay the fines and it's a slap on the wrist.''
   The Court of Appeal panel upheld the Attorney General's appeal
against a High Court ruling that favored the magazine in March.
   The High Court found that two February 1989 articles did not
pose a threat to the administration of justice in the trial of
Peter Sutcliffe, who became known as the Yorkshire Ripper. Those
articles claimed the defendant's wife, Sonia Sutcliffe, had
provided her husband with a false alibi and defrauded the
Department of Health and Social Services.
   They were printed while Mrs. Sutcliffe was pursuing a libel case
against the magazine for alleging she tried to cash in on her
husband's notoriety by agreeing to sell her story to a newspaper.
   Prosecutors said that in addition to possible influencing jurors
in the murder trial, the articles were aimed at dissuading Mrs.
Sutcliffe from continuing the libel case.
   She won a $109,000 award in May 1989 in the libel action and
also received a $181,000 settlement from the magazine.
   Lord Justice Parker said he ruled out imprisoning Hislop in the
contempt matter but he said, ``Any similar conduct in the future
would be unlikely to attract such leniency.''
   Peter Sutcliffe was jailed for life in 1981 for killing 13 women
and attempting to kill another five. Mrs. Sutcliffe was not
implicated in any of the crimes.

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission relaxed the
control of low-level radioactive wastes despite repeated concerns
expressed by staff advisers and the Environmental Protection
Agency, internal documents showed today.
   The documents were released by a congressional panel that is
questioning the decision, announced last month, that the NRC no
longer regulate a wide range of low-level radioactive materials
from nuclear power plants, laboratories and hospitals.
   At a hearing before the House Interior energy and environment
subcommittee, a number of congressmen expressed concern that states
would be forced to accept radioactive wastes from other states as
part of normal garbage destined for landfills.
   States like West Virginia and Indiana, already targets for
out-of-state garbage shipments, fear they ``will become the dumping
ground'' for radioactive wastes, said Rep. Joe Rahall, D-W.Va.
   ``I'm concerned where we're heading in terms of nuclear
wastes,'' said Rep. Philip Sharp, D-Ind., who said states will be
prevented from restricting such shipments under the NRC rules.
   The NRC's commissioners were expected in later testimony to
defend the policy change as no threat to public health.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., the subcommittee's chairman, said
the NRC policy ``has the potential to endanger the public health''
and ``is an open invitation to abuse by unscrupulous operators''
who want to dump radioactive materials in ordinary landfills.
   Under the new policy, such low-level wastes as gloves, clothing,
lab equipment and even buildings and equipment at nuclear power
plants can be disposed of as if they were normal garbage if
radiation doses are below a certain level.
   The commission plans to consider exempting various wastes on a
case-by-case basis as requests for exemptions are submitted by
industry under the new policy guidelines.
   NRC Chairman Kenneth M. Carr has argued that the policy change
represents a way to save lives because federal and state regulators
will be able ``to spend our resources on threats that are more
important.''
   But representatives from the EPA, a half-dozen members of
Congress and a number of state radiation control officials were
expected to testify against the NRC action, announced on June 27.
   According to documents obtained by Miller's subcommittee, the
EPA as well as key NRC staff members expressed concern repeatedly
during the two years the new policy was being debated that too many
wastes are being deregulated.
   The NRC decision would exempt from special control wastes that
subject individuals to radiation doses of less than 10 millirem per
year _ half the level of a normal chest X-ray.
   ``We believe that is too high a level (of exposure) for a
blanket deregulation criteria and is not protective of the public
health,'' the EPA's Office of Radiation Programs, concluded in a
briefing paper submitted to the subcommittee. The EPA made similar
arguments to the NRC before the policy change was made.
   The EPA maintained that the 10 millirem cutoff for regulatory
action could result in as many as three additional cancer deaths
for every 10,000 people exposed. ``Numerous standards established
by the EPA, including those for drinking water, set upper limits of
risk at lower levels,'' it said.
   According to internal NRC memos and other documents, key
commission staff members also expressed strong reservations about
the 10 millirem cutoff level as the new policy was debated in 1988
and 1989.
   A staff report in June 1988 urged that only wastes with
radiation doses of 1 millirem per year be deregulated. Among those
who objected to the 10 millirem cutoff was Robert M. Bernero,
acting director of the NRC's Office of Nuclear Material Safety and
Safeguards, according to the documents.
   Bernero in one memo to his NRC superiors expressed concern about
the health effects to individuals who may be subject to numerous
exposures of such wastes and the long-term effect on such materials
on the waste stream.
   But the objections from Bernero and other staffers were
overruled by senior NRC officials, the documents indicated.
   The EPA later suggested the cutoff be set at 4 millirem per
year, but that was rejected.
   ``In their zeal to relax the regulation of the nuclear industry,
the NRC commissioners have ignored the objections of their own
staff experts, the Environmental Protection Agency, the states and
the public,'' said Miller.
   The nuclear industry _ as well as the NRC commissioners _ have
argued that the wastes that are at issue emit only extremely small
doses of radiation.

<HEAD>Police Recommends Illegal Weapons Charges Against Klein</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police recommended that an army reservist be
charged with illegal weapons exports in connection with an Israeli
arms shipment diverted to Colombian drug lords, Israel radio said
today.
   The April 1989 shipment of 400 Galil assault rifles, 100 Uzi
submachine guns and ammunition was destined for the Caribbean
island nation of Antigua, but it ended up with reputed Colombian
drug kingpin Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha.
   Israel radio said police recommended that Col. Yair Klein be
charged with exporting weapons without a permit. The report did not
specify Klein's alleged role, nor say whether he was involved in
diverting the arms to Colombia.
   Police spokeswoman Ruth Schlesinger would not comment on the
report. She confirmed that the National Police Major Crimes Unit
completed its investigation of Klein and sent the results to the
stat prosecutor.
   Justice Ministry spokeswoman Etty Eshed said her office had not
yet received the police material.
   Klein could not be reached for comment. He has denied wrongdoing.
   Klein has said the shipment was intended for a training school
he wanted to set up in Antigua for Panamanian rebels opposed to
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. When plans for the school fell
through, Klein said, the Panamanians wanted the weapons shipped to
Panama, but somehow they were diverted to Colombia.
   In Colombia, accusations surfaced last year that Klein was
involved in traning assassination teams for Gacha, who was killed
in a December battle with Colombian police. Klein denied the
accusations.
   In May, a Jerusalem magistrate's court charged Klein with
illegally exporting military expertise and material to a group in
Colombia. The charge said Klein made a deal with a group known as
``The Farmers' Organization'' in Colombia in April 1988. It made no
mention of the drug cartel.
   Defense Ministry officials said Klein did not have permits
required for conducting training or exporting arms.

   Five months after agreeing with President Bush
on lofty goals to produce ``an American renaissance in education,''
the nation's governors meet this weekend to decide who will oversee
the task and how to assess students' progress toward that target.
   The governors, traveling to Mobile, Ala., for the 82nd annual
meeting of the National Governors' Association, hope to agree on
the makeup of a bipartisan commission and its role in evaluating
progress in reaching the six national education goals.
   The governors also intend to decide how students should be
tested and which learning skills should be measured.
   While discussions began soon after the goals were outlined, Mike
Cohen of the governors' association said this week a consensus
still has not been reached on many details.
   ``There's no horrible impasse,'' said an association official
who requested anonymity. ``But building a consensus on anything is
just not an easy process. ... These are not people who normally
agree on a lot of things.''
   At stake are the goals Bush set forth in his State of the Union
address in January. The governors, who met with the president last
fall in an ``education summit,'' gave their approval to the goals a
month later.
   Besides making American students ``first in the world in math
and science'' by the year 2000, the goals call for improving
student competence in English, history and geography; increasing
the high school graduation rate to at least 90 percent; upgrading
early childhood education; improving adult literacy and freeing
schools of violence and drugs.
   The nation's state school officers called on the governors and
the president to adopt an eight-step set program of national
strategies including enactment of a federal education ``goals
bill'', transfer of military personnel and technology to teaching
jobs and schools to achieve the goals.
   The Council of Chief State School Officers said in a statement
sent to the chief executives that the governors and president have
raised national expectations and should implement an agenda that
would link student performance with what the nation expects them to
know and be able to do.
   The governors are leaning toward organizing the commission along
three tiers.
   They would include a policy-steering group _ possibly made up of
governors _ to oversee the student assessment process, an advisory
group of high-level education specialists and business officials,
and a staff to carry out the advisory group's recommendations.
   Perhaps more contentious will be determining a way to measure
student success in achieving the national goals.
   Most states test students on their general academic knowledge.
But decades of widely reported dismal results have forced educators
to reassess the most commonly used testing and assessment methods.
   Even within the Bush administration, there is disagreement on
the meaning of standardized test scores. Education Secretary Lauro
Cavazos released his department's annual ``wall chart'' of
state-by-state performance reports over objections from the White
House.
   Thirty-two states test elementary pupils statewide, with the
most popular tests being the California Achievement Test, the
Stanford Achievement Test, the Metropolitan Achievement Test, the
Science Research Associates Test, the Comprehensive Test of Basic
Skills and the Iowa Test of Basic Skills.
   The other 18 states allow local officials to pick the tests
given to students in their district.
   The National Council of Teachers of English has said repeatedly
that standardized testing distorts and debases the language arts
curriculum. Many people wrongly conclude that high scores on
multiple-choice tests are proof of students' ability to use the
language effectively in life and in learning, the group said.
   If not standardized tests, what?
   Several states are experimenting with innovative testing methods
_ most of which have been lumped under the category
``performance-based testing.'' Such assessments can include
teachers' evaluations of students' work based on collections of
their essays, poems and drawings.
   Michigan, Illinois, California and Connecticut have been leaders
in this movement, said Lawrence Rudner of the Education
Department's Educational Resources Information Center.
   Florida has a five-year plan to phase out standardized tests.
   ``The concept is that standardized, multiple-choice tests are
limited because of the breadth and depth of what they can test,''
Rudner said. Students also need to be tested on how well they work
in groups and on their problem-solving abilities, for example.
   The American Federation of Teachers has called for ``phasing out
standardized, multiple-choice tests and replacing them with
reliable, valid and educationally appropriate alternatives.''
   AFT President Shanker said performance-based assessments more
accurately depict the status of American education than
standardized tests.
   A harsh critic of all assessment methods is Albuquerque, N.M.,
physician John Jacob Cannell, leader of Friends for Education, a
non-profit citizens' group.
   ``Performance-based assessment is another form of cheating,''
Cannell said in an interview.
   He contends that 83 percent of 5,143 elementary school districts
and 73 percent of 4,501 secondary districts report standardized
achievement test scores above national norms, as do 48 of the 50
states.
   ``In an honest test,'' he said, ``half the states would be below
average instead of having all of them claim to be above. And by
being below the national average, then schools would be forced to
spend extra money and admit that they are failing.''
   Cannell contended that many teachers and principals now coach
students on test questions, give students more than the allotted
time to take tests and even alter answer sheets to raise scores.

   Delta Airlines will reduce its
participation in next month's PGA Championship, joining other
advertisers protesting the lack of black members at the host Shoal
Creek Country Club.
   Meanwhile, Mayor Richard Arrington said today he expects the
country club to add blacks as members within a year.
   Toyota and Anheuser-Busch on Wednesday joined IBM in canceling
plans to run commercials during ABC and ESPN telecasts of the
tournament. Toyota and IBM officials said they pulled the spots
because Shoal Creek has no black members. Anheuser-Busch did not
give a reason for dropping its ads during the Aug. 9-12 tournament.
   ESPN is broadcasting the first two days of the golf tournament,
with ABC carrying the last two days.
   Bill Berry, a spokesman for Delta, told USA Today that Delta may
have a ``presence'' in the tournament because of contractual
obligations, but that it would reduce its participation. ``This is
one of those embarrassments we have no control over,'' he said.
   Delta is an official sponsor of the PGA Tour.
   Arrington, who is black, has tried to smooth over the
controversy. He has insisted that Birmingham has become racially
progressive in the past two decades.
   At a news conference today, he said Shoal Creek members have
``given me their commitment'' that blacks will be considered for
membership within a few months.
   He said it usually takes six months for an ``expedited
membership'' at Shoal Creek. Based on commitments to him from a
number of Shoal Creek members, he said he was confident that the
club ``will include blacks within the next year.''
   Officials at Shoal Creek, founded in 1977 and site of the 1984
Professional Golfers' Association Championship, have said the club
does not ban black members and that blacks have been guests there.
   But club founder Hall Thompson angered many when he was quoted
in a newspaper story as saying the club could not be pressured into
accepting blacks. He later apologized and said he was quoted out of
context.
   Arrington released a letter today from Thompson in which the
founder assured the mayor that race would not be a factor in
evaluating proposed new members.
   New members must be invited to join. Memberships cost up to
$35,000, with an additional yearly fee.
   The PGA said July 14 that in the future it would consider clubs'
membership policies in picking tournament sites.
   The Rev. Abraham Woods, who has called for picketing of the
tournament, said Wednesday the club should at least ``set a
timetable for actively recruiting blacks.''
   The planned protests could be averted if Shoal Creek accepted
Arrington as a member, said Woods, president of the Birmingham
chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
   Arrington, who does not play golf, has said he is ``not the
country-club type.'' He is now in his third term as Birmingham's
first black mayor.
   Mark Mandel, manager of sports information for ABC, declined to
comment on the impact of the Shoal Creek developments or the
network's view of the matter.
   Chris LaPlaca, ESPN's vice president of communications, said,
``Our sales people have not been officially notified by the
corporate types so there's nothing for us to say at this point.''

   David Souter met today with the chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee that will consider his Supreme Court
nomination and refused to answer reporters' questions about
abortion and affirmative action.
   Souter spent an hour in private discussions with committee
chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., who will preside over the
confirmation hearings expected in September.
   The quiet New Hampshire jurist continued to dodge questions by
reporters following him as he made his courtesy calls.
   Asked if there was any way to get him to talk about his views on
abortion, he responded: ``In a word, no.''
   How about affirmative action?
   ``Same word,'' he said. ``I like that word.'' But he kidded a
reporter to ``keep it up.''
   After his meeting with Biden, Souter said, ``I look forward to
making my positions clear to the extent it is constitutionally
appropriate'' when the hearings begin. Biden declined to reveal the
contents of their discussions.
   Souter did write a letter on the abortion issue nine years ago,
asking the New Hampshire Legislature not to pass a law that would
put judges in the position of having to decide whether minors can
have abortions.
   Souter wrote the letter at the direction of his fellow state
Superior Court judges, and abortion-rights advocates say they don't
interpret it as an friendly or hostile to their position.
   Asked about the letter today, Souter said, ``I think you should
save any issue of that sort ... for the confirmation hearing where
I'm sure that issue will be addressed.''
   Meanwhile, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh told the National
Press Club he thought Souter would deflect the Senate's questions
if they strayed too close to the controversial.
   ``To try to pin down any prospective appointee on a specific
issue or a specific case would seem to me to verge on the improper
and certainly be unwise,'' the attorney general said.
   ``I think I trust to Judge Souter's wisdom and experience to
enable him to walk the line between giving the members of the
Senate an appropriate road map to his judicial philosophy, politely
declining to respond to questions that are case or
issues-related,'' Thornburgh said.
   Several senators have said they would try to probe Souter's
views, with the understanding it was not proper to ask how he'd
vote on specific cases. The nominee has not addressed many of the
nation's politically most sensitive issues during seven years as a
state judge or while serving on the federal bench in Boston since
April.
   In his chitchat Wednesday with senators and the press, Souter
said he might be well portrayed by a recent comment that he was a
``classic Down-Easter,'' a term that normally refers to the
private, reserved style of people in the southeast part of Maine.
   During a visit with Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, himself a former federal judge, the two men expressed
mutual admiration for retired Chief Judge Frank Coffin of the 1st
Circuit.
   Souter recalled once receiving a complimentary letter from
Coffin.
   ``I would frame it, but that would be ostentatious,'' said the
50-year-old bachelor who, except for years away at college, has
lived in the same farmhouse near Concord, N.H., since he was 11
years old.
   Asked by reporters for his feelings two days after Bush made his
choice, Souter said, ``I really don't have any substantive feeling
to express.''
   ``I think the best news I have is the blood is circulating to
the brain well enough now so that I'm beginning to have some
feelings,'' he said.

<HEAD>Plate Used to Make $100 Bills Reported Missing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bureau of Engraving and Printing said
today it has mislaid a steel plate bearing Benjamin Franklin's
picture that was formerly used to print $100 bills.
   The Secret Service was notified and sent two agents to
investigate, bureau spokesman Ira Polikoff said.
   Polikoff said the bureau believes the plate is still in its
building and is working on the theory that it has gone astray
because of a clerical error.
   The plate is one of about 3,200 made last year, Polikoff said.
It is about three feet by eight feet and weighs eight pounds.
   ``It's not something you can easily fold up and put in your
pocket,'' the spokesman said.
   Polikoff said anyone leaving the building with any package
larger than a billfold is routinely searched. He said this applies
even to the highest level officials of the bureau.
   The plate turned up missing during a monthly inventory check
July 6.
   Polikoff said it had been found to be defective, so was no
longer being used in printing bills and was scheduled for
destruction.
   ``We believe at this point it was nothing more than a clerical
error,'' Polikoff said.
   Polikoff spoke by telephone from San Francisco. He said that
before he left Washington Tuesday, the Secret Service sent two
agents to investigate. He said the service is routinely informed in
such cases.
   The spokesman said he did not know anything about the Secret
Service's investigation. Rich Adams, the Secret Service spokesman
in Washington dealing with the case, said agents were interviewing
employes at the printing plant and had not reached any conclusions.

   The Soviet KGB has come in from the cold
in Poland, where it now has an officially registered mission after
decades of covert influence on the secret service here, the new
Interior Minister told lawmakers.
   The KGB delegation, headed by a general, has the status of
Soviet Embassy staff, said Minister Krzysztof Kozlowski, the
Solidarity-backed journalist who recently took control of the
ministry that oversees the police.
   ``If we objected, there would be agents anyway, only we would
not know who they are,'' Kozlowski told a meeting of Solidarity
parliament members Wednesday.
   The minister said cooperation with the KGB until recently
``reached deep into the ministry, with standing KGB advisers,
consultants and liaison officers installed in various departments
and divisions.''
   ``This kind of presence has ended, and will never return,''
Kozlowski said. Cooperation now is on ``completely new principles.''
   Decisions are now made between the ministries, and recent
discussions included Poland's promise to assist Soviet Jews in
emigrating, Kozlowski said.
   The new minister replaced Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, one of four
Communists who remained in the Solidarity-led government formed
last September.

   Most major rivers in Bangladesh have
burst their banks because of heavy rain, leaving more than 1
million people homeless, officials and news reports said Thursday.
   At least 38 people drowned or died in houses which collapsed
from the flooding, they said. Major roads were impassible.
   The Brahmaputra and Ganges rivers inundated large parts of 13 of
the country's 54 districts, an official at the Flood Control Center
said.
   The worst-affected area was the northern district of Sirajganj,
said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. At least
300 villages in the district have been washed away and large tracts
of rice paddies inundated.
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad toured Sirajganj and ordered
immediate relief measures.
   Giasuddin Ahmed, the top administrator of Sirajganj, said in a
telephone interview that all schools and colleges in the district
had been closed and the buildings were used to shelter the homeless.
   At least 500,000 people lost their homes in the flooding, he
said. Other officials said at least 1 million people were affected
nationwide.
   Floods are an annual problem in Bangladesh, a low-lying nation
of 110 million people. Most major rivers of the Indian subcontinent
flow through Bangladesh before emptying into the Bay of Bengal.

   Communists and neo-fascists scuffled in the Italian
Senate on Thursday and one man was hit in the eye by a flying
object, news reports said.
   The president of the Senate, former Premier Giovanni Spadolini,
suspended the session for 30 minutes and expressed his ``deepest
bitterness'' over the incident.
   Italian news agencies said the fracas was triggered by remarks
by Francesco Pontone of the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement. He
reportedly accused the Communists of approving the nominations of
security service officials in the 1970s who were later linked to
the now outlawed Propaganda Due (P-2) Masonic lodge.
   Neo-fascist Senator Cesare Pozzo was treated in the Senate

<TEXT>
   In its first voyage since being grounded 16 years
ago for a radiation leak, Japan's sole nuclear-powered ship
suffered yet another mishap because of a faulty emergency signal,
officials said Thursday.
   The Mutsu's 8,242-ton nuclear reactor shut off automatically
Wednesday when an emergency light indicated the temperature of the
ship's primary coolant water had risen too high, said a spokesman
for the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute.
   Upon investigation, however, ship officials discovered that the
temperature was at the required 523 degrees and concluded that the
alarm system was at fault, he said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The official said there was no leak of radioactivity from the
ship, which had been cruising in the Pacific Ocean 217 miles east
of Inubozaki Point, about 60 miles east of Tokyo. The ship will
continue on its course, he said.
   The $673 million vessel has been plagued by a series of
accidents since its maiden voyage in 1974 when the ship's reactor
leaked radiation.
   Protests by anti-nuclear groups and local residents and
fishermen in several ports throughout Japan first prevented the
ship from being repaired and later from finding a home for several
years.
   Since 1988, it has been anchored at the specially built port of
Sekinehama in northern Japan.
   The Mutsu left port July 10 to begin a series of tests to gauge
the impact of wave vibrations on the reactor and to check its
safety systems.

   A small, unmanned reconnaissance helicopter
being developed by Israel for its navy crash-landed during a test
flight, a spokeswoman said Thursday.
   The crash came two days after the government-run Israel Aircraft
Industries unveiled the prototype and said it had undergone a
series of successful tests.
   The drone ``landed hard'' after one of its systems malfunctioned
during a flight at the Mata testing ground in Jerusalem, said IAI
spokeswoman Sylvia Beit-Halachmi. Some damage was caused to the
drone's twin rotors.
   The purpose of the trial flight was to ``identify possible
malfunctions in order to overcome all hitches before beginning
production of a reliable instrument,'' she said.
   The helicopter, which weighs about 2,450 pounds, is to be flown
by remote control from navy ships and is to feed back intelligence
information.

   Police said today they were
questioning three men about the kidnapping and murder of the son of
a prominent union leader whose body was found in a resort city
south of Buenos Aires.
   Guillermo Ibanez was kidnapped July 6. News reports said
kidnappers demanded a ransom of $2 million from his father, Diego,
leader of the powerful state oil workers union and a former
national legislator.
   The body of the union leader's 28-year-old son was found
Wednesday in Mar del Plata, 250 miles south of Buenos Aires.
   He had been shot in the back of the neck.
   The kidnapping was front-page news, and the discovery of the
body was the lead story in every Buenos Aires newspaper today.
President Carlos Menem planned to attend the funeral, scheduled for
later today.
   Police arrested three men thought to have kidnapped and killed
Ibanez and were questioning them today. No charges were immediately
filed.
   The kidnapping and slaying were denounced by human rights
organizations, unions, religious groups and top politicians.
   The oil workers union stayed off the job today to show their
sympathy for the Ibanez family and to repudiate the ``monstrous
crime.''
   Menem indicated he favored the death penalty for the suspects if
they are charged and convicted in the case.
   ``Do such beasts deserve to live?'' he said in an interview.

   Two firefighters were killed Thursday

   ``They were ahead of everybody else with a hose when the fire
outflanked them and just swallowed them up,'' an officer said in a

   Forestry officials were unable to estimate the damage to the

   Olympia, a sanctuary that was the site of the ancient Olympic

   Excavations have revealed part of the temple of Zeus, one of the

   About 100 Soviet teen-agers who were
victims of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster have arrived for
a monthlong vacation in Denmark, newspapers said Thursday.
   The children, ages 13 to 15, will spend time in outdoor scout
camps and will stay a week with Danish families.
   Under a project of the United Nations Educational, Scientific

   As several thousand advocates for the disabled
looked on, President Bush today signed an act banning
discrimination against the nation's 43 million handicapped people.
   ``Every man, woman and child with a disability can now pass
through a once-closed door to a bright new era of equality,
independence and freedom,'' Bush said as he signed the measure in a
ceremony on the South Lawn.
   The president likened the Americans with Disabilities Act of
1990 to the dismantling of the Berlin Wall as a symbol of freedom
for a once-oppressed people. It ``takes a sledgehammer to another
wall,'' he said.
   The bill prohibits discrimination against the disabled in
employment, public accommodations, transportation and
telecommunications, and defines as disabled anyone who has a mental
or physical impairment limiting ``some major life function.''
   The disabilities bill, like other major civil rights
legislation, includes a variety of sanctions for violators,
including those who discriminate in hiring. It allows victims of
employment discrimination to seek back pay, reinstatement and
attorneys' fees. However, the law exempts businesses with fewer
than 15 employees from the hiring provisions.
   The measure includes new protection for AIDS-infected workers.
   ``This day belongs to you,'' Bush told the audience gathered
outside the White House. It was one of the largest bill-signing
ceremonies ever held at the White House.
   About 2,000 people, representing groups that lobbied for the
bill, sat in wheelchairs or on folding chairs at the ceremony in
bright sunshine with temperatures in the mid-80s.
   White House officials had considered moving today's ceremony
inside and reducing its size because of the anticipated heat.
   But protests from disability groups, including a threat by some
to hold a separate ``people's signing'' ceremony outside the White
House gates, persuaded officials to go ahead with the outside
ceremony.
   ``We considered moving it inside because of the heat concerns.
There could be up to two hours of sitting in the hot sun. But the
disabled community said heat was no problem,'' said White House
spokeswoman Alixe Glen.
   Some activists had suggested that the White House notion that
disabled people are too frail to sit out in the summer sun showed
the very kind of bias the legislation was designed to end.
   In signing the bill, Bush said, ``This historic act is the
world's first comprehensive declaration of equality for people with
disabilities.''
   He called it an ``historic new civil rights act.''
   The crowd gave one of its loudest cheers when Bush said the law
would give the disabled expanded access to transportation.
   ``It's just fantastic. It's a tremendously exhiliarating
feeling,'' said Gordon Anthony, 35, an activist and marketing
consultant from Los Angeles who uses a wheelchair. ``Employers are
going to start reaching out to the disabled,'' he said. ``It may
open doors for what I do in my future career. There may be better
opportunities.''
   In advance of the ceremony, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater called the bill ``a milestone in President Bush's
decade-long personal commitment to the rights of the disabled.''
   ``I think it affects a broader scope of people than any law
since the 1964 (Civil Rights) Act,'' Fitzwater said.

<HEAD>Mandeal, De Kerlk Meet After Row Over Arrest of ANC Member</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk held
an urgent meeting with African National Congress leader Nelson
Mandela today after the ANC denounced the arrest of a senior
member, a source said.
   The president's office announced the meeting a day after the
arrest of Mac Maharaj, who is also a Communist Party leader. Police
said Maharaj was being held in connection with a plot they said
involved Communist members of the ANC.
   Neither the president's office nor the ANC would say if the
meeting had taken place in Pretoria, but a reliable source who
spoke on condition of anonymity said it had. The source had no
details about what was discussed.
   De Klerk's office said the president wanted to meet with Mandela
because it appeared the ANC ``does not appreciate the seriousness
of facts brought to light'' by a recent police investigation into
the alleged plot to seize power.
   Many members of the ANC's 35-member National Executive Committee
are also members of the South African Communist Party.
   A radio report said the meeting had already taken place, but de
Klerk's office denied that.
   In recent weeks, police have arrested 40 members of the ANC
under the Internal Security Act, under which Maharaj is being held.
   The act allows authorities to hold detainees in solitary
confinement without legal representation and interrogate them until
they give ``satisfactory answers.''
   Maharaj had been organizing a Communist Party rally planned for
Sunday to mark the party's emergence as a legal political group
after years as an underground movement.
   The party, headed by Joe Slovo, was legalized by the
white-minority government in February. For years, the government
had portrayed it as a terrorist organization operating under Soviet
control.
   Maharaj's arrest was a ``concerted attempt to disrupt our
rally,'' party spokesman Jeremy Cronin told a news conference. He
claimed police were trying to spread fears of a conspiracy by
Communists to seize power if government talks with the ANC failed.
   ``There's no `red plot' whatsoever,'' he said.
   Before the de Klerk-Mandela meeting was announced, Cronin said
andela would attend the planned rally in the black township of
Soweto outside Johannesburg and make a major statement about the
ANC's relationship with the Communist Party. He gave no details.
   Mandela said earlier the opposition group would go ahead with
talks Aug. 6 with the government despite the arrest. The ANC, which
condemned Maharah's arrest, and the government are trying to clear
the way for talks on ending white-minority rule and extending
political rights to the black majority.
   ANC leaders have said the arrest of Maharaj and other Communist
members of the ANC will be discussed with the government at the
Aug. 6 talks. The talks are aimed at clearing away obstacles to a
cease-fire and proceed with formal negotiations to end white
minority rule.
   After postponing talks once because of police action, ANC
leaders said they would continue to object to such activity, but
would not allow anything to interfere with progress toward an end
to apartheid.
   One of the obstacles to negotiation, the ANC has said, is the
existence of the Internal Security Act, under which Maharaj and
other ANC members have been detained indefinitely for questioning.
ANC leaders appear to believe that they have a better chance of
getting their members freed, and ending such arrests, by
negotiating with the government.
   The government has said little about the reported arrests,
except to warn all political groups not to try to seize power and
affirm its determination to maintain law and order.
   Mandela and other ANC officials have refused to sever their
organization's ties with the Communist Party despite domestic and
international criticism.
   Communist Party leaders plan a major drive for working class
supporters in South Africa's main industrial centers. The
communists say they plan to be a democratic party representing
workers and have attempted to distance themselves from the excesses
of communist groups in Eastern Europe and elsewhere.

   A couple in Chichester, Sussex, on Thursday bagged
top honors for running the nation's best spot for a spot of tea.
   The national Tea Council selected Shepherd's Tea Rooms as the
best place in Britain to get a cup of tea.
   The sedate tea room in a historic building serves 700 pots of
tea a week in 10 different blends to locals and tourists in
Chichester, nine miles northeast of Portsmouth. The tea room is run
by newlyweds Richard and Yvonne Spence.
   Everything from the taste of the tea to the courtesy of the
staff and the ambience of the rooms was considered during a number
of secret visits, said the Tea Council's executive director, Illtyd
Lewis.
   ``You might ask why so much trouble over a pot of tea, but tea
is our national drink,'' Lewis said.
   According to the Tea Council, more than 80 percent of people in
Britain surveyed said they drink tea, which accounts for 43.9
percent of all beverages consumed except for tap water.

<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Honecker unfit to face charges. No

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A medical panel has ruled that deposed
Communist leader Erich Honecker is too ill to be prosecuted, but
that an 82-year-old former secret police chief is fit enough to
face criminal charges.
   Honecker, who ruled with an iron hand before being toppled in
last year's pro-democracy revolution, had been charged with
corruption and abuse of power.
   He is suffering from kidney cancer and is staying at a Soviet
military hospital outside Berlin.
   The government said even though allegations of abuse of office
and corruption justify criminal prosecution of Honecker, the
77-year-old former leader's health is too precarious.
   West Germany is still pursuing murder charges against Honecker
for his part in promulgating the notorious shoot-to-kill order
which led to the deaths of at least 192 people trying to flee into
West Germany.
   The former secret police chief, Erich Mielke, was formally
placed under arrest today pending an investigation of charges he
harbored terrorists and jailed critics of the former regime.
   Mielke, the onetime chief of the now-disbanded domestic
intelligence network, had been in a Berlin hospital undergoing a
medical evaulation to determine his competency to face the charges.
   The competency decisions were based on the results of an
independent medical panel's evaluation of Honecker, Mielke, and
several other members of the ousted Communist regime, said federal
spokesman Peter Przybylski.
   Mielke's arrest brings to three the number of former Communist
officials who have now been judged competent to face investigation.
   Also being held is former East German labor union chief Harry
Tisch and former Communist Party economist Guenter Mittag.
   Mielke's arrest follows reports that terrorist suspects linked
to some of the most notorious attacks of the past two decades
regularly lived in or traveled through East Germany with the
approval of authorities, including his secret police.
   Eight reputed members of the Red Army Faction, blamed for a
series of killings and bombings in West Germany in the 1970s and
1980s, have been arrested in the past several weeks in East Germany.
   Some had been living there for more than a decade. All had
assumed names, and some said they were given housing and false
identities by the former secret police.
   The secret police, known as the Stasi, intimidated, harassed and
monitored millions of people and was considered one of the most
skilled and feared intelligence networks in the world.

<HEAD>Hasenfus: Secord, Southern Air Skimped on Safety to Boost Profits</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The surviving crewman of a downed Contra supply
plane today tearfully recounted the dramatic last moments of a 1986
plane crash that helped unravel details of the Iran-Contra affair.
   The testimony came from Eugene Hasenfus, who with the family of
co-pilot Wallace Sawyer Jr. is suing Richard Secord and Miami-based
Southern Air for allegedly misleading the crew and using aircraft
without adequate safety equipment.
   Hasenfus, his voice cracking, said his C-123 was flying into
southern Nicaragua on Oct. 5, 1986 with supplies for a Contra force
pinned down by Sandinistas.
   He said that suddenly a Sandinista rocket struck the plane.
   ``There was a loud explosion from the right. I was astounded.
The whole plane was on fire,'' Hasenfus said.
   Wearing a parachute, Hasenfus jumped through the open cargo door
and was in a near state of shock as the aircraft spiraled to the
ground. He evaded the Sandinistas overnight in the jungle but was
captured the next day. Sawyer and two crewmen died in the crash.
   As he testified today, Sawyer's wife, Kasanee, of Magnolia,
Ark., and Hasenfus' wife, Sally, watched intently with tears in
their eyes as well.
   The crash of Hasenfus' plane was a key revelation leading the
Reagan administration to acknowledge illegally diverting money from
Iran arms sales to the Contras.
   Prior to recounting the crash, Hasenfus said he was hired
through the Southern Air headquarters at Miami International
Airport and understood he was working for a front company operated
by that airline.
   He said the crews complained that there was no safety equipment
such as parachutes and that the navigation radios did not work
properly.
   Hasenfus' suit says Southern Air skimped on safety to boost
profits in the Contra supply effort.
   But defense lawyers in the federal suit said in opening
arguments Wednesday that Hasenfus knew the risks when he joined the
fight against communism in Central America.
   Secord's lawyer, Thomas Spencer, said his client never met or
made any promises to the crew and that they knew the dangers of
supplying the Contras in enemy territory.
   Secord, a retired Air Force major general, pleaded guilty Nov.
8, 1989, to lying to congressional investigators when he said he
was unaware of any money that went to Oliver North's benefit from
the maze of companies he used in the Iran-Contra affair. He is
serving a two-year probation.
   Southern Air attorney Robert Beckman told the six-member jury
Wednesday that the airline was not responsible for the crew or the
crash.
   He said Hasenfus and Sawyer had contracted with Corporate Air
Services, which he acknowledged worked with Southern Air. But he
strongly denied Corporate Air was merely a front for his client.
   Southern Air was once owned by the CIA and continues to do
contract work for the government.
   Hasenfus' lawyers say they are still calculating damages. On
Wednesday they submitted some figures to Secord showing actual
damages of about $2 million for Sawyer's family and about $1
million for Hasenfus.

<TEXT>
   As a state judge nine years ago, Supreme
Court nominee David Souter urged New Hampshire's legislature not to
adopt a law that would have put judges in the position of approving
abortions for minors if their parents refused permission.
   Souter did not express a personal stand on the issue, but said
his fellow judges had decided that a measure then pending before
the state legislature would promote ``shopping for judges'' because
it did not include guidelines on how judges should act. Therefore,
he said, the bill would unfairly leave such decisions up to
individual judges with varied opinions on abortion, resulting in
inconsistent application of any such law.
   Asked about the letter in Washington today, Souter said, ``I
think you should save any issue of that sort ... for the
conbfirmation hearing where I'm sure that issue will be addressed.''
   New Hampshire abortion rights activist Peg Dobbie said Wednesday
Souter's letter was critical to efforts to kill the legislation.
She added, ``But while it helped us, you can't read into it
anything about how he might feel personally about abortion,'' an
issue likely to dominate Souter's Senate confirmation hearings.
   The letter drew silence from right-to-life groups, who had no
immediate reaction.
   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We
have no reaction to it one way or the other.''
   Dawn Johnsen, legal director for the National Abortion Rights
Action League in Washington, said the letter was reason for the
Senate to probe Souter's views on constitutional issues surrounding
abortion during its hearings. But she said NARAL did not view the
letter as revealing Souter's inclinations on the central abortion
issue.
   ``I think it is not very illuminating on Judge Souter's position
on the constitutional right to privacy, including the right to
choose,'' Johnsen said.
   She said it ``suggests that Judge Souter might vote with
conservatives on the court to allow a law that mandated parental
consent without any escape valve for teen-agers who are victims of
child abuse and family violence,'' and thus are unable to discuss
an abortion with their parents.
   ``I don't see much reason for encouragement,'' Johnsen said.
``At best it's neutral. It's a complicated letter on just the
judicial bypass. ... There are people who are looking for the
silver lining, but I don't think this is it.''
   The 1981 letter, written to the chairwoman of the legislative
committee considering a parental consent bill, is one of Souter's
few public actions addressing the abortion issue.
   In his one abortion-related decision on the issue as a judge,
Souter gave little insight as to how he might vote if confirmed and
confronted with the opportunity to overturn the 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision legalizing abortion.
   In 1986, Souter sided with the majority in a ruling that said
physicians have a responsibility to test unborn children for birth
defects and, in the event defects are detected, to counsel the
pregnant woman about options -- including abortion.
   A month after the Roe vs. Wade decision, Souter was among the
Concord Hospital board members at a meeting at which the board
approved allowing abortions at the hospital.
   Two board members contacted Wednesday, Dean Williamson and
Marily Wilson, said they recalled only non-controversial discussion
and a unanimous voice vote in favor of allowing abortions. Neither
recalled Souter speaking during the discussion.
   ``This was a medical procedure vote, not a social issues vote,''
Ms. Wilson said. ``It was not over the rights or wrongs of abortion
but rather about our responsibility as a medical facility in light
of the law.''
   In his 1981 letter on behalf of fellow Superior Court justices,
Souter said the bill before the legislature failed to provide
guidelines for the judges to use in deciding whether to allow
minors to receive abortions if they did not have parental consent.
   Abortion-rights advocates said there was nothing in the letter
to shed light on Souter's personal views on abortion.
   ``I can't for a minute say that this indicates he is opposed to
restrictions on abortion; it's too vague to make any interpretation
at all,'' said Peg Dobbie of the New Hampshire chapter of the
National Abortion Rights Action League.
   ``I wish we could say that you could interpret this that way,
but you could just as easily say that he favors a parental consent
law but just doesn't think the court or the judges should be
involved.''
   Indeed, other Superior Court judges since Souter was elevated to
the state Supreme Court have sent virtually identical letters to
the legislature during debate of other parental-consent bills over
the past decade, all of which have been defeated.
   The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that parental-consent laws must
contain an option permitting a judge to decide if the minor seeking
an abortion does not want to consult her parents.
   Souter's two-page letter said the court was not taking a
position on whether the legislature should require parental consent.
   The judges objected that in passing the bill, legislators would
be endorsing as the will of society ``to leave it to individual
justices of this court to make fundamental moral decisions about
the interests of other people without any standards to guide the
individual judge.''
   Without clear guidelines, Souter wrote, ``there would be left
only the individual judge's principles and predilections.'' And, he
said, ``as carefully considered as these might be there would still
be those of only one individual, not those of society.''
   Souder noted that the judiciary often is criticized for imposing
its views on the society at large and said the pending parental
consent law would force an individual justice to impose his or her
individual view.
   ``As you would expect, there are some judges who believe
abortion under the circumstances contemplated by the bill is
morally wrong, who could not in conscience issue an order requiring
an abortion to be performed,'' Souter wrote, without giving his own
view.
   ``There are others who believe that what may be thought to be in
the `best interests' of the pregnant minor is itself just as
necessarily a moral as a social question upon which a judge may not
morally speak for another human being whatever may be that judge's
own personal opinion about the morality of abortion.''
   Such internal conflict would lead to ``shopping for judges who
would entertain such cases,'' Souter wrote.
   Several legislators reached late Wednesday said the current
chief judge on the Superior Court, Richard Dunfey, circulated a
virtually identical letter to lawmakers last year when they were
considering a similar measure.
   When Souter served as New Hampshire attorney general, he
supported obscenity indictments against Penthouse magazine and a
drug store that sold its July 1976 ``Bisextennial'' issue.
   Souter's office did not bring the initial charges but
represented a county prosecutor before the New Hampshire Supreme
Court 12 years ago when the defendants sought to have the
indictments dismissed. The high court refused to dismiss the
indictments, but it did declare unconstitutional a portion of the
state law's definition of sexual conduct.
   The case was among dozens Souter's office argued before the
state court while he was attorney general in 1977-78. Collectively,
they show he supported positions much like the tough law-and-order
approach he later took as a state judge.

<TEXT>
   President Vaclav Havel of
Czechoslovakia today warned of the dangers of lying about the past
in comments indirectly critical of President Kurt Waldheim, his
host during a controversial visit to the city.
   Havel and the West German president, Richard von Weizsaecker,
met briefly with Waldheim as the Salzburg Festival of music and
drama opened. Most Western leaders have shunned Waldheim for
concealing his Nazi past, and the presidents' visit angered Jewish
groups.
   Both leaders repeatedly emphasized the visits were private, not
official. No private meetings with Waldheim were planned.
   Havel, Weizsaecker and Waldheim attended a lunch given by
Salzburg governor Hans Katschthaler, the official host, before
Havel and Weizsaecker left for home.
   American Rabbi Avi Weiss was arrested with an associate inside
the festival hall after they forced their way into the lobby
shouting: ``It's a shame to meet Waldheim!''
   Weiss and three other activists also protested Wednesday outside
Weizsaecker's sprawling West Berlin palace, wearing concentration
camp uniforms.
   Havel's comments in the opening ceremony were made in the
context of changes in Eastern Europe over the past year that
instituted democracy. While he never mentioned Waldheim's name,
some of the language appeared clearly directed at the Austrian
president, who sat stone-faced in the first row.
   ``The expectation that one can negotiate his way through history
without punishment and be able to rewrite his own biography is part
of the traditional madness of middle Europe,'' said Havel.
``Whoever tries to do this, hurts himself and his fellow citizens.
   Waldheim, a former U.N. secretary-general, drew international
criticism for concealing his service as an intelligence officer
with a Nazi army unit implicated in atrocities in Yugoslavia and
Greece during World War II. He has denied wrongdoing.
   Since his election in 1986, Waldheim has been shunned by most
Western nations, including the United States.
   This month, Cypriot President Georgios Vassiliou became the
first Western head of state to make an official visit to Austria
since Waldheim's election. Pope John Paul II met with Waldheim in
1987.
   Heinz Galinski, head of the German Jewish Council, said last
week he was ``shocked'' over Weizsaecker's meeting with Waldheim.
   Weiss, in a statement Tuesday, condemned both Waldheim and
Weizsaecker. ``We view the meeting of Havel and Weizsaecker with
Waldheim as obscene and we will be raising a voice of moral
conscience against Waldheim, who is an unrepentant Nazi,'' the
rabbi said.
   ``We especially are outraged that at a time of German
reunification, the president of West Germany is meeting with
Waldheim. The only way Germany can move forward is to reject people
like Waldheim,'' Weiss said.
   ``I am attending a cultural event as a private person,'' Havel
said in an interview published Wednesday by the Salzburger
Nachrichten newspaper.
   ``However, at the time of the visit I am also president _ that
is something one cannot discard, that is to say something official
remains attached to any of my visits.''
   While Havel criticized Western leaders for continuing to steer
clear of Waldheim, he made it plain he was unlikely to make a state
visit to Austria as long as Waldheim is president. Waldheim's term
is to expire in 1992.
   The Czechoslovak state news agency CTK carried a statement today
by Havel's office saying the former dissident accepted the
invitation to the festival last year, when it appeared unlikely the
then-ruling Communists would let him go.

<TEXT>
   Postmaster General Anthony Frank endorsed
legislation Thursday to require child-proof packaging of mailed
medicine samples, saying it could ``head off a disaster before it
happens.''
   The bill was inspired by an incident last March in Saline,
Mich., in which a group of children ages 3 to 8 obtained sample
packages of Tylenol gelcaps from an open mailbox area in an
apartment complex. The Postal Service typically places mailed
samples in open racks or on tables in the mail area of apartment
buildings when the packages don't fit in mailboxes.
   The children, pretending the gelcaps were cocaine, were crushing
them and apparently intended to inhale the powder. But an adult saw
what was happening, confiscated the medicine and notified police.
   Frank said he had received no reports of children actually
ingesting direct-mail medicine samples.
   ``We all have it in our power to head off a disaster before it
happens and what a great feeling that is for a change,'' he told
the House Subcommittee on Postal Operations and Services. ``We
stand foursquare behind the bill.''
   No opposition surfaced during the subcommittee hearing. Voicing
support for the bill were Donnelley Marketing, the company that
handled the Tylenol mailing; the Direct Marketing Association; the
Third Class Mail Association; and two agencies of the U.S. Postal
Service.
   The bill would require that pharmaceutical and hazardous
household product samples sent through the mail be packaged in
child-proof containers. The Postal Service would refuse to deliver
samples not meeting the standard.
   James Douglas, director of the Saline Department of Public
Safety, said about 110 sample packages of Tylenol gelcaps were
taken from the children.
   The University of Michigan's poison control center later told
police that as few as six of the gelcaps could cause serious, or
even fatal, liver disease in a 40-pound child. That is the typical
weight of children ages 3 to 5, Douglas said.
   An overdose of aspirin and similar drugs would not cause any
readily observable symptoms such as vomiting or unconsciousness, he
said. Poison control officials told him the only way to determine
whether a lethal dosage had been consumed is to conduct a ``blood
screening'' within six hours of the time the drug was ingested,
Douglas said.
   ``This truly is a situation where a tightening of rules and
regulations could prevent a threat to public safety,'' said Rep.
William Ford, D-Mich., a co-sponsor of the bill.
   Donnelly Marketing already has adopted a policy requiring
child-proof packaging of medicine samples it distributes, senior
vice president Ellen M. Farley said.
   While supporting the legislation, she said its effective date _
Oct. 1 or 60 days after its enactment, whichever is later _ might
not give manufacturers enough time to comply. An additional six
months should be allowed, Ms. Farley said.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Presumed Innocent''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOLORES BARCLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Arts Editor</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   In their publicity material for the movie ``Presumed Innocent,''
Warner Bros. asks reviewers not to reveal the ending or say whether
Rusty Sabich (Harrison Ford) is innocent or guilty.
   It's an interesting request, considering that the 1987 Scott
Turow best-selling novel sold more than 1 million in hardback and
millions more in paperback. Needless to say, a lot of people know
Rusty's fate.
   But nothing that happens at the beginning of the Alan J. Pakula
courtroom thriller, or even as it unravels, sets up the end. The
movie is plump with twists, turns and blind alleys. Who can be
trusted? Who is innocent? Who is guilty?
   The novel is set in mythical Kindle County, in an unidentified
Midwest city with Chicago-style politics and corruption. The movie
was shot in Detroit.
   Rusty, a married, top-flight prosecutor, is assigned to
investigate the murder of another prosecutor, Caroline Polhemus
(Greta Scacchi), with whom he had been sexually involved. Polhemus
was found bludgeoned to death and tied up in what appeared to be an
act of sexual bondage.
   But a glass containing a little beer and Rusty's fingerprint is
left in plain view, making it real easy for police to point a
finger. A telephone check also finds numerous calls made from
Caroline's number to Rusty's number and vice versa, including a
call made the day of the murder.
   Rusty wasn't the only man bedding Caroline. His boss, Raymond
Horgan, the chief prosecuting attorney, also was intimate with
Polhemus. Horgan is in the midst of a bitter campaign for his seat
against the smarmy Nico Della Guardia. Horgan (Brian Dennehy) loses
the election and serves up Rusty _ on a platter once he discovers
Rusty's relationship to Caroline _ to his former foe.
   Rusty hires the best defense lawyer around, the scholarly and
elegant Sandy Stern (Raul Julia), and the game is afoot.
   Woven into the courtroom suspense is a thread of corruption that
goes back to Polhemus' days as a probation officer and somehow
involves Della Guardia's sidekick, a moldy little prosecutor named
Tommy Molto (Joe Grifasi).
   The strength of ``Presumed Innocent'' is its rich gallery of
well-developed characters. Its weakness is perhaps in execution of
the final plot turn. The book crafts duplicity and surprises far
better than the almost labored denouement presented on film. And a
key clue, one the camera sweeps by in a flash, and pivotal to
knowing who the murderer is, never really blossoms.
   Caroline Polhemus is a nasty piece of work, disliked by men
because she's aggressive and beats them at their own game. She
volunteers to tackle sex crimes, cases usually relegated to the
worst lawyers in the department because they're a no-win situation.
   However, it is unfortunate that the author and now the
filmmakers seem to think that the only way a smart woman can
succeed professionally is by sleeping her way to the top.
   Polhemus is sexually attracted to Rusty because he represents
power in her office and is just a step away from the No. 1 spot, a
spot she covets. But why is Rusty drawn to her? There is no
chemistry or sexual tension between them. But he falls into her
arms after a tough child abuse trial like a lovesick puppy.
   Ford plays Rusty straight, almost too straight. He loves his
wife, we surmise and is happily married, we suppose. Or, is he
bored by a wife who whines about being a housewife and mother?
   He admits he does not love Caroline but she's gotten into his
blood. Or, perhaps just the passion and lust have. Theirs is a
purely sexual bond. Still, his motive for engaging in a
professionally and personally dangerous affair is fuzzy.
   Scacchi, a European beauty, is seductive and hungry as Caroline.
She can be an ice queen, but has a gentler side as when she coaxes
an abused child into testifying against his mother.
   As Rusty's wife, Barbara, Bonnie Bedelia radiates compassion,
frustration, love and fear. It is one her strongest performances.
   Julia puts in a good turn as Sandy Stern, and Paul Winfield adds
charm and humor to courtroom prancing as the trial judge, Larren
Lyttle. There's also good support from Brian Dennehy as Raymond
Horgan and John Spencer as the hard-working detective whose loyalty
and sense of duty figure importantly in the end.
   Pakula (``All the President's Men,'' ``Sophie's Choice'') takes
his time unraveling the story from the screenplay written by
himself and Frank Pierson (``Dog Day Afternoon''). He plays for
reactions, underlying motives, the quirky human element.
   And here, he has a great similarity to Otto Preminger's handling
of courtroom suspense in 1959's ``Anatomy of a Murder'' with James
Stewart. But missing is the hard-edged tension Billy Wilder
sculpted in 1957's ``Witness for the Prosecution.''
   Both are gripping dramas. Both rely on the element of surprise
to make a compelling film. And both are among the best courtroom
dramas ever made. Now ``Presumed Innocent'' has joined the ranks.
   ``Presumed Innocent'' is a Mirage Production, produced by Sydney
Pollack and Mark Rosenberg with Susan Solt as executive producer.
It is rated R for strong sexual content and unpleasant shots of the
murdered victim.

   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., was joined by two
other lawmakers beset by recent sex scandals in abstaining from a
vote Thursday on expelling Frank from the House because of his
official actions on behalf of a male prostitute.
   Joining Frank in voting ``present'' on the vote to expel him
were Reps. Gus Savage, D-Ill., and Donald E. Lukens, R-Ohio. The
House rejected 390-38 the move by Rep. William Dannemeyer,
R-Calif., to expel Frank.
   Savage was sharply criticized earlier this year by the House
Ethics Committee following an inquiry into allegations that he
tried to molest a Peace Corps volunteer during a visit to Zaire.
   Lukens was defeated in the Republican primary in Ohio in May for
his party's nomination for re-election after he was convicted last
year on charges resulting from having sex with a 16-year-old minor.
   It is customary for the legislator being judged in a
disciplinary proceeding by the House or Senate to vote ``present.''

   Roseanne Barr made an obscene gesture and spit
on the ground after she was booed at a San Diego Padres game for a
shrill rendition of the national anthem in front of 30,000 baseball
fans.
   The comedian and star of ABC's ``Roseanne'' appeared to struggle
Wednesday night with an echo from the sound system as she sang
between games of a doubleheader with the Cincinnati Reds, said Ron
Seaver, the Padres' promotions director.
   Barr plugged her ears with her fingers at the start of the song,
then sang in a shrill voice. After the boos began, Barr reached
toward her crotch and spit on the ground.
   Barr's husband, Tom Arnold, later made a ceremonial pitch with
no reaction, but Barr got more boos as she waved to the crowd and
left with him.
   ``The Padres understand that many people were concerned about
Roseanne Barr's rendition of the national anthem,'' Seaver said.
``She was doing the best she could under the circumstances of the
audio delay and she certainly meant no disrespect to the national
anthem.''
   Barr said she was pleased with her performance.
   ``I think I did great and people wanted more,'' she told a
reporter for KFMB-TV before leaving the field. Asked about the
boos, she said, ``Yeah, well, just because they weren't up front.''
   At least two Padres players were upset by her singing, spitting
and gesture afterward.
   ``I was embarrassed as a person and I was embarrassed for them
(the Padres),'' said Padres pitcher Eric Show, who was on the
field. ``I can't believe it happened. It's an insult. There are
people who died for that song.''
   ``I thought it was a disgrace,'' Padres outfielder Tony Gwynn
said. ``When they said she was going to sing the national anthem I
thought something like this was going to happen.''
   Tom Werner, who become the chairman and managing partner of the
Padres this season and also is co-creator and executive producer of
``Roseanne,'' had invited Barr to sing ``The Star-Spangled
Banner.'' He would not comment after Barr's performance.
   Barr's publicist George Freeman and ``Roseanne'' show and Werner
spokesman David Brokaw didn't immediately return telephone calls
today.

   An FBI agent testified today that he thought
the Jan. 18 undercover sting operation against Marion Barry had
failed until the mayor unexpectedly asked for crack cocaine.
   Lawyer R. Kenneth Mundy called Agent Ronald Stern to the witness
stand in an attempt to show that the FBI entrapped the mayor. The
defense was nearing the end of its case, and Mundy said it was
unlikely Barry would testify.
   Agent Ronald Stern said at Barry's cocaine and perjury trial
that an undercover agent carrying crack cocaine left a hotel room
where Barry had gone to meet ex-model Rasheeda Moore. Barry had
said initially he didn't want the crack.
   ``There was no longer any drugs in the room,'' Stern said. ``As
far as we were concerned, the operation was over.
   Stern, who was monitoring the sting from a nearby room at the
hotel, said Barry then told Ms. Moore to call the undercover agent
back.
   On the FBI videotape of the sting shown earlier at the trial,
Barry tells Ms. Moore: ``Got get some. Go get it.'' She calls the
undercover agent back to the room to retrieve the crack.
   ``The important thing here is what Mr. Barry was thinking,''
Stern testified. ``He believed that'' the undercover agent ``was an
opportunity for drugs.''
   The FBI and police rented eight hotel rooms for the sting and
provided the drugs used in the operation, Stern said.
   Earlier, Barry's lawyers suggested that prosecutors had
intimidated witnesses into testifying falsely against the mayor.
   Mundy played for the jury a Feb. 28 news broadcast of U.S.
Attorney Jay Stephens exhorting witnesses to come forward and
cooperate in the criminal investigation of Barry.
   Stephens made the statement the day that Barry pleaded innocent
to cocaine possession and charges.
   ``The time is now to come in,'' Stephens said in the broadcast.
``The alternative of course is prosecution.''
   Government witness Lloyd Moore testified that the broadcast was
a factor in his decision to begin cooperating with government
investigators.
   Moore testified that he saw Barry use drugs about 10 times.
   ``You testified truthfully?'' assistant U.S. attorney Richard
Roberts asked Moore on cross-examination.
   ``Yes,'' replied Moore, who is an attorney.
   There is ``nothing unusual about seeking the assistance of
witnesses in solving crimes?'' asked Roberts.
   ``They do it every day,'' replied Moore.
   On Wednesday, a Virgin Islands couple testified that the FBI had
badgered them about their repeated statements that they never saw
Barry use drugs on a 1986 sailboat ride.
   Carmen Benjamin said she was interviewed three times by agents,
the final time late last year when she and her husband were
summoned to FBI headquarters in Washington.
   She testified that she felt so ``pressured'' and ``harassed''
that she pounded her hand on the table. She said she demanded that
the interogation end, but that agents continued to question her.
   Mrs. Benjamin said she was snorkeling while the sailboat was
anchored in the Virgin Islands and didn't pay much attention to
Barry and Ms. Moore.
   The mayor is accused of 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine
possession, one misdemeanor conspiracy charge and three felony
counts of lying to the grand jury.
   Convicted drug dealer Charles Lewis testified earlier that he
and Barry smoked marijuana aboard the sailboat, on which the
Benjamins were passengers.
   Did the FBI and a city police detective ``attempt to pressure
you to change your story?'' Robert Mance, one of Barry's lawyers,
asked Albert Benjamin.
   ``Yes,'' Benjamin replied.

<TEXT>
   Police on bicycles zigzag through
jungle tracks, dodging land mines in a deadly game with teen-age
Tamil rebels.
   It is the ``bicycle brigade'' against the ``baby brigade,'' as
police call the young militants of the Tamil Tiger militia. Some
are as young as 12, and their most successful weapons are homemade
mines that have blown the legs off dozens of commandos since
fighting resumed last month.
   As a result, officers of the Special Task Force, police trained
to fight the Tamils, formed the ``bicycle brigade.''
   ``The bicycle tire has more chances of avoiding the buried
explosive than a boot. The damage causes less injuries as the blast
is cushioned by the bicycle,'' said senior commando Upali Sahabandu
of the Special Task Force.
   The mines, which consist of high explosives packed into wooden
boxes with two small AA batteries, have been dubbed Johnnies, Dice
or Batta by the Sri Lankan troops. They are hidden in culverts
under the jungle roads of Tirukovil, which was once a Tamil
stronghold.
   The government claims its troops now control a 33-mile stretch
of the eastern coast between Lahugala, south of Tirukovil, and
Kalmunai to its north.
   Special Task Force chief Lionel Karunasena said his unit of 125
men has mastered the art of anticipating rebel moves.
   The rebels operate in groups of five to seven to minimize
losses. ``We do the same. We know their game, they know ours. So we
are even,'' Karunasena told a group of visiting reporters.
   ``That is why they avoid tangling with our bicycle brigade or
hit us with mines on these roads,'' he said.
   His unit is part of the 2,500-member Special Task Force trained
to help in the war against militant Tamils fighting for an
independent homeland.
   Commandos moved into the town and set up camp in its main
hospital this month, forcing the once-dominant Tamils to slip into
the jungles.
   People in the town, 135 miles east of Colombo, say that although
the troops control the area during the day, the rebels return from
the jungles to prowl at night.
   ``A dog's bark in the dark is a sure sign the Tiger rebels are
around. Nobody else moves out at night,'' said the Rev. Thaya
Seelan, a Tamil Methodist priest.
   The commandos say their taking of Tirukovil, which has ample
jungle cover to the west and the Indian Ocean to the right, dealt a
severe blow to guerrilla operations.
   ``Tirukovil is vitally located for jungle based hit-and-run
attacks. Without Tirukovil as a base ... it will be difficult for
the terrorists to launch any campaign to clear government forces in
the eastern coast,'' said Sahabandu, the veteran anti-guerrilla
fighter.
   Karunasena said he plans to ``first secure our hold here,'' then
move toward rebel strongholds in the eastern districts of Ampara
and Batticaloa.
   The Tamil Tigers have been fighting since 1983 to set up a
homeland in the north and the east, complaining of discrimination
by the majority Sinhalese.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
the Sinhalese account for 75 percent.
   More than 2,850 combatants and an unknown but large number of
civilians have died in the latest round of fighting, which began
June 11 after a 13-month cease-fire.
   ``When will this end? When will the killings stop? When will the
gods intervene?'' moaned Murugesu Tirunavakarasu, a chili planter
whose only son, Raju, disappeared three years ago.
   ``We don't want anything else but to be left in peace. You
people from outside don't know the hell we have gone through,'' the
68-year-old farmer said.
   Schools, banks and government offices have been shut for several
months. There are no vehicles or buses on streets except commando
jeeps and armored troop carriers.
   But there are scenes of normalcy.
   Acres of paddy sway in the breeze, waiting to be harvested.
Buyers haggle in the market. Fishermen throw their nets into a
murky lagoon, watched by women carrying reed baskets.
   A short distance away, five commandos tighten their bullet
bandoleers around their chests, climb on their bicycles and push
away into the bush.

<HEAD>Senators Urge Additional Changes in U.S. Policy Toward Cambodia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixty-six senators of both parties called
Thursday for President Bush to make further changes in U.S. policy
toward Cambodia, including permitting development aid and direct
talks with the communist government in Phnom Penh.
   The senators, nearly two-thirds of the Senate, also challenged
administration assertions that there is no consistent military
coordination between the two non-communist factions fighting the
Cambodian government and the feared Khmer Rouge rebels with whom
they are allied.
   Those signing the letter, led by Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., spanned the
political spectrum in the chamber. Their move reflected growing
congressional fears of a Khmer Rouge military victory,
inadvertently abetted by the United States.
   The group included 13 Republicans and 53 Democrats.
   On July 18, about a week after the original letter to Bush began
circulating in the Senate, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
announced that the United States was withdrawing its support for a
U.N. seat for the rebel coalition.
   Baker also said the United States would open a limited dialogue
with the government of Vietnam, which installed Hun Sen in power
before withdrawing its troops last year. And he said limited U.S.
humanitarian aid could begin flowing to Cambodia, which is the
subject of a 15-year-old U.S. embargo.
   In the letter sent to Bush on Wednesday, the senators welcomed
those moves, but said additional steps would be necessary to
demonstrate that keeping the Khmer Rouge from re-taking power is
the highest aim of U.S. policy.
   The Khmer Rouge were responsible for the deaths of more than a
million Cambodians during their 3{-year rule in the late 1970s as
they sought to force their vision of a communist agrarian state on
the country. People executed or died of starvation and disease.
   The senators called for three additional steps:
   _ Pressing the government of China, which U.S. intelligence
estimates provides $100 million a year in military aid to the Khmer
Rouge, to end its support for the communist rebels.
   _ Opening direct contacts with the Hun Sen government in Phnom
Penh aimed at arranging free and fair elections supervised by the
United Nations.
   _ Permitting U.S. development aid to flow to Cambodia to
strengthen and redirect its beleaguered economy.
   In addition, the group called for closer scrutiny of the $7
million in overt non-lethal aid and the estimated $13 million in
covert military aid which the United States now sends each year to
the rebel coalition.
   The letter emphasized that U.S. law bars any aid which has ``the
effect of promoting, sustaining or augmenting, directly or
indirectly, the capacity of the Khmer Rouge... to conduct military
operations.''
   It did not call directly for an aid cutoff, but asked the
administration ``to thoroughly investigate'' reports of military
cooperation between the non-communist rebels and the Khmer Rouge
``to ensure that there is no tactical or strategic cooperation.''.
   The Senate Intelligence Committee voted June 28 to cut off the
covert aid program.
   The Central Intelligence Agency and Defense Intelligence Agency,
in briefings for interested officials, have described how the three
allied rebel groups share supply lines which are controlled by the
Khmer Rouge, and coordinate their anti-government attacks.
   Deep inside Cambodia, the lines between the separate fighting
forces are blurred, the intelligence reports say, and the rebel
group of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, backed by the United States,
serves as a political front to bring respectability to the Khmer
Rouge.
   ``The Khmer Rouge are marching again, and from the reports I
have received they are marching together with the forces of Prince
Sihanouk,'' Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee, said in a floor speech.
   The letter concluded: ``We believe that after 20 years of
turmoil and tragedy, the people of Cambodia deserve an opportunity
to determine their own future free of fear of the Khmer Rouge.''

<TEXT>
   Clementine, Gene, Martha and Smudge are fat
cats now.
   A judge ruled that the four cats can legally inherit the lion's
share of their owner's estate, with the money going to pay for
their foster care in a new home.
   Clinton County District Court Judge C.H. Pelton decided
Wednesday that the will of Melody Stanton is clear in its meaning.
It asked that the estate be placed in a trust ``for the care and
comfort of the only possessions I have in my life, my animals, my
cats.''
   ``No one was ever so kitty-nuts as she was,'' said Ms. Stanton's
mother, Eleanor Hodge of Camanche. Ms. Hodge said her daughter's
tombstone has a black cat engraved on it. Three of the four cats
are black.
   Ms. Stanton, 42, died in November after a long illness.
   Clementine, Gene, Martha and Smudge stand to gain more than
$10,000. Ms. Stanton's total estate is valued at about $19,000, but
about a third of that will go to pay debts.
   Ms. Stanton stipulated that the cats ``be placed in foster care
with people who love them,'' and that the cats should ``be given
tender loving care and loving companionship at all times.''
   The cats are staying at a Clinton veterinary clinic until a
judge rules on who should take care of them permanently.
   Ms. Hodge said she would take the cats if she did not already
have four of her own. She is Ms. Stanton's only heir and would be
entitled to the estate if all four felines died. She also was named
executor of the estate.

   A merry-go-round served as their cathedral
and carousel horses as pews for Denise and Ricky Appleton's wedding
_ just the perfect altered altar for a couple of carnival workers.
   ``It'd make good pictures,'' the groom said Tuesday after the
ceremony at the Ottawa County Fair.
   Appleton, a 38-year-old accountant and handyman for the W.G.
Wade Carnival, tied the knot in the same spot he began dating
28-year-old Denise Rolen, a fellow carnival employee, two years ago.
   Rolen was escorted by her father to the carousel along a rose
petal trail laced with electrical cords from concession stands.
Instead of the usual carnival calliope music, ``We've Only Just
Begun'' was piped out.
   Witnesses included carnival workers who surrounded the
merry-go-round, between the ``Supa-bounce'' game and a french fry
stand, to hear the Rev. Ben Jansen perform the ceremony.
   ``I encourage creativity. I tell them, `Let's do what you would
like to do,''' said Jansen, who has performed weddings at rodeos
and hockey rinks.
   After the rings and vows were exchanged, the two left the
carousel under a shower of popcorn.
   ``We're having chile-cheese dogs at the reception,'' the new
Mrs. Appleton said.

   Art treasures allegedly pilfered by an American

haggle over ownership of the treasure.
   Attorneys for the church in Quedlinburg and for the heirs of
former Army Lt. Joe T. Meador, who allegedly took the centuries-old
objects, announced the agreement today at the Dallas Museum of Art.
   The museum agreed to provide a ``temporary, neutral safe
haven,'' said museum director Richard R. Brettell in a statement.
However, the pieces will not be displayed publicly until the
lawsuit brought by the church is settled.
   ``Claimants presently contemplate permitting the museum
subsequently to display the objects ... with terms for any display
to be negotiated later,'' the statement said.
   The objects to be brought to the museum include articles of
gold, silver, ivory and crystal dating from the 8th to 14th
centuries, the museum said.
   The agreement was reached today between law firms representing
both sides.
   The items have been in Whitewright, about 60 miles north of
Dallas, and Dallas since 1945, the museum said.
   The artworks have been stored recently in safety deposit boxes
in banks in those cities.
   The Lutheran church, Stiftskirche-Domgemeinde of Quedlinburg,
claims Meador, who lived in Whitewright, stole the trove while his
unit was guarding a mine shaft where the items had been hidden.
   Attorneys for Jack Meador of Whitewright and Jane Meador Cook of
Mesquite, brother and sister of the deceased soldier, have been
negotiating a proposed move of the treasures to the Dallas museum.
   The ownership lawsuit is being heard by U.S. District Judge
Sidney Fitzwater of Dallas, who is expected to review the
agreement. Fitzwater on July 9 ordered the heirs and the church to
agree on a facility to store the items until the case is settled.
   Meador, who died in 1980, bequeathed the artwork to his siblings.

   In Margaret Thatcher's favorite book,
the working class rises up to take bloody revenge against the rich.
   That's just one of the insights gathered by librarian Margaret
Berketa in a survey of the rich and famous' reading habits as part
of a major project to mark the International Year of Literacy.
   More than 150 celebrities have replied to her letters requesting
details of their favorite books, and the responses are still
flowing in.
   Among them are letters from members of the British royal family
who because of protocol politely declined to nominate one book.
   But Mrs. Thatcher, in the midst of a record-breaking term as
Britain's prime minister, praises ``A Tale of Two Cities'' by
Charles Dickens, which has one of the most famous opening lines in
literature:
   ``It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.''
   Dickens' story is set during the French Revolution, and the hero
is beheaded by the guillotine in the tragic finale.
   Mrs. Thatcher says it was her favorite book as a child.
   Singer Cliff Richard, known as the Peter Pan of pop, likes the
passion of ``Wuthering Heights'' by Emily Bronte.
   Actor Larry Drake of ``L.A. Law'' likes ``Catch 22'' by Joseph
Heller.
   ``Took me three or four attempts to get past the first
chapter,'' Drake wrote. ``Contains the most wrenching scene in
literature _ the final revelation of the death of Snowden, the tail
gunner.''
   Heavy metal guitarist Angus Young of the group AC-DC chose ``A
Confederacy Of Dunces'' by John Kennedy Toole and ``Schultz'' by
J.P. Donleavy.
   The most popular books in the survey were ``Wind in The
Willows,'' the adventures of Toad, Rat and Mole; and Tom Wolfe's
acidic look at New York's social classes, ``The Bonfire of The
Vanities.''

   Cher's sudden fear of flying is
delaying her concert tour.
   It started when her chartered USAir plane developed engine
trouble Wednesday and had to make an emergency landing in New
Jersey.
   The incident shook Cher up and she refused to fly, preferring to
travel by train to Boston and then by bus to Halifax, promoter Jack
Livingstone said Thursday.
   Her sold-out concert originally scheduled for Wednesday night in
Halifax has been rescheduled for Friday. Thursday's planned show in
Moncton, New Brunswick, has been moved to Saturday night, and a
Saturday concert at Old Orchard Beach, Maine, has been moved to
Sunday.
   Fans who can't make the rescheduled concerts will get their
money back.

   Roger Daltrey, lead singer of The Who, accepted a
$272,000 settlement Thursday in his lawsuit against a nearby farm
that he blamed for the deaths of up to 500,000 fish at his own
trout farm.
   Daltrey and his company, Beju Bop Ltd., had sued owners of The
Home Farm where a leak of liquid fertilizer in August 1986 entered
a river and caused damage at Daltry's Iwerne Springs Fish Farm in
Dorset in southwest England.
   Daltrey, 45, originally had sought damages of $905,000. The Home
Farm had admitted liability, but disputed the amount of damages.
   Daltrey had told the court that the dead fish included 1,000
valuable brood fish capable of producing millions of eggs a year.
   During a two-day hearing before the settlement was reached,
Daltrey gave detailed testimony showing a surprisingly extensive
knowledge of fish farming. He said he had been interested in trout
farming since he built his own fishery in 1979.

   President Chaim Herzog of Israel underwent knee
surgery Thursday after tearing a tendon in a fall in his garden, a
spokeswoman president said.
   The operation involved stitching the tendon, said spokeswoman
Penina Kirshenbaum.
   ``The president had a successful operation this morning and will
be released from the hospital in a few days,'' she said.
   Herzog, 72, has served for seven years as president, a position
that's largely ceremonial.

   A juror today was removed from deliberations
for a huge money-laundering trial after reports that a member of
the jury apparently telephoned members of a Colombian drug ring for
more information.
   U.S. District Judge William Terrell Hodges held a closed hearing
today on whether to declare a mistrial. Few details were available
because of a gag order in effect for lawyers and their clients for
the duration of the trial.
   But court clerk John Gay said the original panel of 12 is down
to eleven. Alternate jurors were dismissed after testimony ended,
and deliberations can continue with eleven jurors when both sides
agree. There was no immediate indication if any action was taken
against the dismissed juror.
   Gay said transcripts of today's hearing and two meetings
Wednesday will be made public when they are transcribed, but that
could take several days.
   Attorneys learned Wednesday that one of the 12 jurors undertook
some independent investigation, including making telephone calls to
purported Medellin drug cartel members in Colombia, and then shared
information with another juror, according to a report in today's
Tampa Tribune.
   Five employees of the Luxembourg-based Bank of Credit and
Commerce International and a Colombian airplane broker are accused
of conspiring with an undercover U.S. Customs Service agent to
launder $14 million in proceeds from the sale of cocaine in six
U.S. cities.
   The first public indication of trouble in the six-month trial
surfaced Wednesday morning when jurors were sent home shortly after
reporting to begin their fourth day of deliberations.
   The judge met privately with prosecutors and defense attorneys
twice Wednesday to discuss the situation. The lawyers and court
personnel refused to discuss the problem or divulge what occurred
during the private meetings.
   The newspaper reported that the juror who telephoned cartel
members got the phone numbers from an address book that was
introduced into evidence at the trial. Authorities took the book
from the briefcase of one of the defendants, Colombian Rudolf
Armbrecht, when he was arrested in a Miami motel in October 1988.
   U.S. Attorney Robert W. Genzman and Larry Curtin, spokesman for
the Tampa FBI office, had no comment.
   Jurors were specifically instructed by Hodges to decide the case
only on evidence and testimony presented during the trial and were
told to avoid and ignore any outside information. They have not
been sequestered and have been allowed to return home throughout
the trial.
   The defendants in the case are Ian Howard and Sibte Hassan of
BCCI's Paris branch; Amjad Awan and Akbar A. Bilgrami of BCCI's
Miami branch; Syed Aftab Hussain, who worked in Panama; and the
Colombian aircraft broker, Armbrecht.
   The bankers were arrested Oct. 6, 1988, at a fake wedding staged
by the Customs Service to lure the bankers to Tampa. They were
taken into custody after being separated from their families under
the pretext of attending a bachelor's party.
   Two BCCI subsidiaries pleaded guilty in January to the
money-laundering charges and forfeited $15 million to the
government, more than triple the previous largest penalty ever
assessed against a bank.

   Madeline and Woody Hovatter's rabbit died in
their pool, and Mrs. Hovatter could only laugh.
   The Phoenix couple's Volkswagen Rabbit was blown into the pool
during a Saturday night storm.
   ``The wind just picked it up and threw it in there, I guess,''
Mrs. Hovatter said. ``It's a Rabbit. She tried to jump the pool,
but she couldn't jump far enough.
   ``I laughed. What can you do? If crying would have brought it
back up, I would have cried my eyes out. But I knew that wouldn't
work, so I laughed.''
   A crane pulled the car from the pool on Tuesday, but not before
Mrs. Hovatter took a swim with it.
   ``I stood on the roof and pretended I was surfing,'' she said.
``It's finally out. I hope it doesn't get blown somewhere else
now.''
   Mrs. Hovatter said the car, which was a total loss, wasn't
covered by the couple's insurance because they carry only liability
on it. But she said they have another car.

   Tropical storm Arthur weakened today as it moved
slowly through the Caribbean Sea, its winds dropping from
near-hurricane strength of 70 mph to 50 mph, the National Hurricane
Center said.
   A tropical storm watch remained for the southern coasts of Haiti
and the Dominican Republic, but the storm was on a track that made
it less of a threat to Hispaniola, the island shared by the two
countries, forecasters said.
   At noon EDT, Arthur's top sustained winds of 50 mph _ well below
the 74 mph minimum-hurricane strength _ were centered near latitude
15.3 north and longitude 69.0 west, or about 230 miles
south-southeast of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
   It was moving west-northwest at 20 and was expected to continue
that motion through the day, said Hal Gerrish, a hurricane
specialist at the center in suburban Coral Gables.
   ``Some further decrease in strength is likely during the next 24
hours,'' he said.
   Storm warnings for Trinidad, Tobago, Grenada and Grenada
dependencies were discontinued Wednesday after the storm passed
through from the Atlantic.
   Grenada reported winds gusting to 55 mph early Wednesday when
the center of Arthur passed over the island, and heavy rains were
reported on Tobago and other islands in the area, said Bob Sheets,
director of the hurricane center.
   Arthur, the 1990 Atlantic hurricane season's first named storm,
grew from a depression, the second of the 1990 season, that formed
Sunday in the open Atlantic. The hurricane season runs from June 1
to Nov. 30.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge fined General Electric Co.
$10 million today for overcharging the government about $8 million
for an Army battlefied computer system.
   U.S. District Judge Lowell Reed Jr. called the fine ``adequate,
fair, and in the best interest of the public.''
   Federal prosecutors said GE, convicted in February on 286
criminal counts, agreed to pay $10 million for those charges.
   Under the deal, GE waived its right to appeal.
   Reed also sentenced Gerald A. Leo, 52, a former employee of
Management &amp; Technical Services Co., a GE subsidiary, to 10 months
in prison and fined him $15,000. Leo was convicted on four counts
of mail fraud and one count of trying to deceive federal
investigators in the case.
   ``He never did anything,'' his wife, Mary, yelled as Reed handed
down the sentence today.
   Leo will remain free while his case is appealed.
   James Badolato, another former employee of the same subsidiary,
faced sentencing later today. Badolato, 43, was convicted of
misleading auditors and submitting false documents.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Harbist said the fine was the
second largest criminal fine imposed in any defense contracting
case. The largest, he said, was $17 million against Northrop in a
case involving defective parts for a cruise missile.
   Prosecutors said the company also agreed to pay $8.3 million to
settle related civil suits and $11.7 million to settle unrelated
civil suits.
   GE, the nation's second-largest defense contractor, was
convicted in February of four counts of mail fraud and 282 counts
of making false claims.
   The government charged that the GE subsidiary did not tell the
government in 1983 that it had shaved its costs by hiring
substantially less-expensive subcontractors to help build the
battlefield computer system. The defense contract was worth $250
million.

<HEAD>Six Sets of Remains Shipped Back to U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six sets of remains that may be
those of missing American servicemen were flown to the United
States on Thursday after a U.S. honor guard saluted and Buddhist
monks prayed to console the dead.
   It was the first time since the Vietnam War ended in April 1975
that Communist authorities in Cambodia have delivered suspected
remains of those missing in action, or MIA.
   ``The United States appreciates the support of the Phnom Penh
authorities for this undertaking,'' said Lt. Col. Thomas Boyd, a
U.S. spokesman. ``We consider this an important humanitarian
undertaking which, if successful, will help to alleviate the
suffering of American families.''
   Cambodia is ready to cooperate with future American MIA
missions, the official news agency SPK on Thursday quoted the
deputy interior minister, Khim Ponn, as saying. He heads an MIA
commission formed last month to cooperate with local officials in
the MIA search.
   U.S. officials had accused the Vietnamese-backed government,
which the United States does not recognize, of using the issue to
exact political concessions.
   An appeal this year by Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., broke the
deadlock.
   Also, Washington announced a week ago that it was withdrawing
recognition of the Khmer Rouge-dominated guerrilla coalition that
is fighting Phnom Penh, and would open talks with Vietnam on ending
the Cambodian civil war. Sources in Washington said Secretary of
State James A. Baker III favors opening talks with Phnom Penh as
the next step.
   The 14-member military team flew to Phnom Penh for the airport
repatriation ceremony.
   Buddhist monks in saffron robes chanted prayers in Pali during a
15-minute memorial service before an altar covered with flowers and
burning incense. The six caskets sat behind the altar, and a monk
sprinkled holy water to bless the dead and speed their rebirth.
   The American military honor guard escorted six aluminum caskets,
each draped with a U.S. flag, on board an Air Force C-141 that took
off for Hawaii.
   In Hawaii, the remains will be analyzed and identified by the
Joint Casualty Resolution Center and the Army Central
Identification Laboratory, agencies that account for America's
wartime missing.
   A total of 2,300 Americans are listed as missing in action in
Indochina. Aside from the 83 in Cambodia, 1,678 are missing in
Vietnam, 533 in Laos and six in China's coastal waters. At least
eight American civilians are also listed as missing in Cambodia,
according to U.S. officials.
   The six remains were among 28 sets that Cambodian authorities
said they have recovered in recent years. A Foreign Ministry
spokesman said his government paid $2,000 for the return of some
remains from remote provinces.
   Six U.S. military specialists examined them in a tiny laboratory
at Cambodia's only medical college on Tuesday and Wednesday, and
decided that six warranted further tests. The team was the first
known official U.S. contact with the Phnom Penh government.
   Two of the six remains that were repatriated were found in
eastern provinces bordering Vietnam. U.S. planes heavily bombed the
area during the war in failed attempts to interdict the Ho Chi Minh
Trail, Communist North Vietnam's main supply route to U.S.-backed
South Vietnam.
   U.S. officials said most of the American servicemen missing in
Cambodia were airmen.
   The other four sets were from Choeung Ek, a southwest suburb of
Phnom Penh that the Khmer Rouge used as a mass execution ground
when they ruled from 1975 to 1978. The Khmer Rouge were ousted
after Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978.
   Boyd said Washington would consider sending another such team to
examine more remains, but added that this was not discussed during
his group's visit to Phnom Penh.

<HEAD>States Far From Mexico Preparing for Africanized Bees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WESLACO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``killer'' bees poised to invade the
United States from Mexico are beginning to worry officials in
states as far away as Maine and Hawaii.
   State agriculture inspectors from 32 states turned out for a
four-day Africanized bee conference, which opened Wednesday in
Weslaco, about 10 miles from the Mexican border.
   Some said they expect their states eventually to be infested,
either by the bees migrating naturally, or being transported as
stowaways on ships or truck trailers.
   ``With modern transportation, it's conceivable that a swarm
could stow away on a ship and establish itself in Hawaii,'' said
Kenneth Teramoto, chief of biological control of plant pests with
the state of Hawaii's Department of Agriculture. ``We'll find out
what Texas and some of the other states are going to do about the
Africanized honey bee and we'll set up a state plan,''
   Robert Mitchell, state apiarist for the Delaware Department of
Agriculture, said he came to Weslaco to learn more about the Texas
Africanized honey bee management plan. He said his state is
preparing for the eventual arrival of the aggressive bees either by
ship or truck.
   Other states represented at the conference included those as
distant as Washington and Vermont.
   ``They're all concerned that they need to be speaking with a
coordinated voice and a coordinated approach to dealing with the
spread of the Africanized bee in the United States,'' said Anita
Collins, head researcher with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
Honey Bee Research Lab at Weslaco.
   ``The main concern is we don't want to harm the beekeeping
industries in those states, because they are our first line of
defense in fighting the Africanized bees,'' she said.
   Twenty-two swarms of Africanized bees have been found and
destroyed since 1979 at U.S. ports aboard ships from Latin America.
The most recent swarm was found at the Port of Houston earlier this
month in the hold of a ship from Mexico.
   The hard-to-manage bees eventually are expected to cost U.S.
beekeepers as much as $58 million per year, according to the USDA.
Expected drops in bee-pollinated crop production could cost U.S.
farmers as much as $40 million per year.
   Most attending the symposium co-sponsored by the National
Association of State Departments of Agriculture and Texas A&amp;M
University are involved in regulating honey bees in their states.
   The Texas Africanized bee management plan includes the
establishment of a 100-mile quarantine zone at the southern tip of
the state, and the sampling of all bee colonies within two miles of
a confirmed Africanized find. Any Africanized bees will be
destroyed.
   But the state has not provided the estimated $800,000 needed to
fund the plan in its first year, said John Thomas, a Texas A&amp;M
extension entomologist.
   He said the bees have been wrongly branded as killers, although
about 600 deaths have been attributed to them, mostly in South
America. Their sting is no worse than that of regular bees, but
they tend to attack by the hundreds if they sense a threat to the
colony.
   ``People are going to have to be much more alert,'' Thomas said.
``It's like if we had only garden snakes in the Rio Grande Valley,
and then we introduced rattlesnakes.''
   Beekeepers are also worried about the Africanized bees because
they are harder to control and less productive than domestic honey
bees.
   Africanized bees are the hybrid offspring of a swarm of African
bees that escaped from a research project in Brazil in 1957. They
have expanded their range through Latin America since then.
   Scientists previously had expected them to cross into southern
Texas by now. But none has been found closer to the border since
November, possibly because a harsh winter and prolonged drought
reduced the food supply needed for migration.

<TEXT>
   Turning 80 isn't bad at all, especially when
Texans are wishing you well, reporter Sarah McClendon said Thursday
at a birthday bash given by the Texas State Society and Texas
Breakfast Club.
   ``Don't let anybody worry you about being 80. It's great,'' Ms.
McClendon told 350 Texans gathered for breakfast in a House office
building.
   Ms. McClendon, a Tyler, Texas native, was the first woman
admitted to the National Press Club. She has reported from
Washington for nearly 50 years and become well known for asking
tough questions at presidential news conferences.
   President Bush sent a congratulatory letter and so did former
House Speaker Jim Wright. Seven current Texas congressmen paid
tribute, including Rep. Jack Brooks, who worked with her as a
reporter at the Beaumont Enterprise in 1939.
   ``Being a Texan means you use your individuality and have enough
guts and courage to stand out and be a good citizen,'' she said.
   ``I'm not quitting because I have a lot of questions I want to
ask George Bush.''
   Ms. McClendon, who has covered every president since Franklin
Roosevelt, said her favorite was fellow Texan Lyndon Johnson even
though he once prodded four newspapers to cancel her service.
   When she was finished speaking, the Texas congressmen stood up
and started barking her name as reporters do to get the president's
attention at news conferences.

<DATELINE>ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's Communist Party
chairman defended himself and his party Thursday before irate
voters who demanded to know the truth behind purges and cover-ups
over seven decades of authoritarian rule.
   ``I didn't repress anybody,'' the white-haired, dignified
Gombojavyn Ochirbat told about 200 people from Ulan Bator's 12th
election district, where he is running for a seat in the national
legislature.
   The contest has become the most dramatic one in the first
multiparty elections ever held in this long-isolated, Soviet-bloc
nation.
   It pits the 61-year-old Ochirbat, a long-time party official who
stresses moderation, against a 29-year-old lawyer with no political
experience who favors bold moves toward democracy and economic
privatization.
   On Sunday, the district's approximately 5,000 voters will decide
whether Ochirbat, arguably the most powerful man in Mongolia by
virtue of his party post, should also sit in the 430-seat
legislature, the Great People's Hural.
   ``The Communist Party in Mongolia is already going down, not
just the organization but the theory of communism,'' said
Ochirbat's opponent, Ganbold of the recently formed Party of
National Progress. ``I decided it would be appropriate not to allow
the head of the Communist Party to be a deputy.''
   Ochirbat became party chief in March when street protests
inspired by Eastern Europe's anti-Communist revolution forced
Mongolia's top Communists to resign. He has overseen the country's
first tentative steps toward democracy, but insists it should
remain socialist.
   On Thursday, he shared a podium with Ganbold as District 12 held
a free-wheeling meet-the-candidates night that would have been
unheard of not long ago.
   Residents of the impoverished shanty district on Ulan Bator's
western fringe eagerly called out questions about past purges, a
recent scandal involving a public prosecutor, rumored price
increases and restrictions on emigration.
   ``In the past (the Communist Party) made many mistakes,''
Ochirbat said, speaking calmly but firmly. ``But we shouldn't just
accuse the party of mistakes. It also has done good things.
   ``My father also was repressed,'' he added. ``In 1932 he was
arrested with a couple of friends. I know history quite well. But
we should understand the situation of that time.''
   Ganbold's Party of National Progress has said it is running in
part against Ochirbat's record as a ranking official of the past
Stalinist regime. He was in charge of party ideology during the
1960s, when a group of intellectuals were purged. But Ochirbat said
he was not involved.
   Speaking about another 1960s purge of two party officials
accused of being pro-Chinese, he said: ``Everybody believed they
were enemies of the people. I was young then, I believed it, too.
But now, according to the archival materials, we can certainly say
... this was a fabricated case.''
   Afterward, local residents said the contest would be close.
   ``It's very democratic,'' said Dorj, rolling a cigarette outside
the tiny meeting hall. ``I think I'll vote for the Communists _ but
I also support the democrats because they put forward the most
interesting proposals.''
   Most of the opposition parties have joined in what is called a
``democratic coalition'' to back key candidates such as Ganbold.
   In Sunday's primary, Ochirbat led with more than 2,500 votes to
Ganbold's more than 1,300, according to partial official figures.
But opposition candidates altogether won nearly as much as Ochirbat
_ showing that he is not invincible. With just the two competing in
the second round, Ganbold's party believes he has a chance.
   ``Most young people support Ganbold,'' said a local backer,
Turtoghokh.
   Ganbold began campaigning door-to-door Wednesday _ a bit late,
he admitted. But in an interview Wednesday night, he said he was
warmly received.
   ``One of my fears that older people would be against me
disappeared today, as I met a lot of older people who said they
were willing to back me,'' he said.
   Ganbold, a junior-level officer in the Ministry of Law and
Jurisdiction, said he knew hard times as a child as his mother
struggled to raise five children by herself. He said he can relate
to the problems of District 12's residents.
   ``The district has no kindergarten, no schools,'' Ganbold said.
``To go shopping they have to go two bus stops. Even the
electricity stops sometimes. There is no telephone.''
   The lesson, he said, is that communism doesn't work. ``Communism
is a foreign idea to Mongolia. That is why a lot of Communist Party
members do not back it ideologically, they just belong.''
   But while meeting the voters, he soft-pedaled his ideological
attacks and kept his promises moderate.
   ``If elected I will try to solve at least one of the smallest
things I've promised,'' he said.

<HEAD>Census Survey Finds Many Elderly Need Assistance With Daily
Activity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 8 million Americans, more than half
of them elderly, need help with at least one daily activity because
of a health problem, according to a Census Bureau report released
Thursday.
   About 16 percent of the population that is 65 and older needed
help with household chores, meal preparation or personal hygiene,
according to the 1986 Census survey, which is the latest data
available.
   These senior citizens make up about 54 percent of the total
number of Americans 15 and older who need assistance to perform at
least one everyday activity. The rest are under age 65.
   About 5.6 million of those needing assistance lived with a
family, while 2.3 million lived alone and 300,000 lived with
non-relatives, according to the survey.
   The survey also found that 5.8 million people over age 15 were
providing care to a household member, and about a quarter of these
caregivers were 65 or older.
   More than 15 million people were helping people outside their
household.

<HEAD>Woman Apparently Gets AIDS From Infected Dentist, CDC Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In the first case of its kind, federal
researchers reported Thursday that a woman apparently got AIDS from
her dentist during a tooth pulling, even though he was wearing
gloves and a mask.
   The case has prompted the government to review its guidelines
for AIDS prevention during medical procedures even though ``the
possibility of another source of infection cannot be entirely
excluded,'' the federal Centers for Disease Control said.
   It said all evidence was ``consistent with'' the patient being
infected during her trip to the dentist.
   The dentist, who had been diagnosed three months earlier, was
wearing protective gloves and a mask, as recommended, while
extracting two molars for the patient, who was visiting him for the
first time.
   ``We don't know exactly what happened during that procedure,''
said Dr. Harold Jaffe, deputy director for science in the CDC's
HIV-AIDS program. ``We have to assume there was some kind of an
accident that exposed the patient to the dentist's blood.''
   But there was no indication of that. The patient didn't remember
the dentist having any cuts, the dentist didn't recall any
accidents _ such as sticking himself with the anesthetic needle _
and dental records indicated the procedure ``should have been
uncomplicated,'' the CDC said.
   Officials of the American Dental Association said the CDC may
have jumped to conclusions.
   ``We're not happy about it,'' said Dr. Enid Neidle, director of
scientific affairs for the Chicago-based ADA. ``We think it is not
a totally conclusive case of transmission. ... We are not happy at
any report that could raise fears on the part of the public that
the dental office is a place of danger and infection.''
   CDC officials stressed that there is no reason to believe the
virus was transmitted just because a dentist with AIDS came close
to a patient. ``We are not suggesting some unique, previously
undescribed kind of transmission,'' Jaffe said. ``And we're
certainly not suggesting to people they should be afraid to go to
their doctors and dentists.''
   The case has prompted the government to review its
recommendations for AIDS prevention in medical settings. ``We will
be looking at the guidelines to see if they need to be modified to
decrease the chance this might happen again,'' Jaffe said.
   AIDS activists worried that the report would spawn new fears
about the disease.
   ``I think that's inevitable,'' said Paul Sathrum, program
director for the National Association of People With AIDS. ``The
hysteria is always out there. ... Any little thing like this always
brings it back to the surface.
   ``This may be the type of situation that would provide
ammunition for the forces who would love to see more restrictions
on people with HIV. I hope that doesn't happen.''
   Two years after the woman's trip to the dentist, she was
diagnosed with a rare pneumonia that strikes some AIDS patients.
She then tested positive for the AIDS virus.
   A lengthy investigation found no risk factors for AIDS in the
woman's past, such as intravenous drug abuse or numerous sex
partners. She said she had two boyfriends before her diagnosis;
both tested negative for the virus.
   The CDC, as is its custom, did not identify the dentist or
patient, except to describe the patient as a young woman.
   DNA ``virus sequence'' tests performed on the dentist and the
patient led investigators to believe their specific viruses were
``closely related,'' with ``a high degree of similarity between the
strains,'' the CDC said.
   Still, Neidle said, the ADA believes too little is known about
the details of the tooth extraction and what might have caused the
infection, including whether the patient was subsequently treated
and whether some complications might have arisen in the placement
or removal of stitches.
   Jaffe said there was no indication that the dentist failed to
follow any guidelines for preventing AIDS transmission. ``The only
question,'' he said, ``would be whether or not the dentist should
have continued in practice'' after being diagnosed with AIDS.
   The ``most obvious'' guide for that, he said, ``is whether the
person is physically or mentally able to do his or her job.''

<HEAD>NBC's ``Today'' Gets Lowest Ratings in Nearly Seven Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite a revamped format and the return of Joe
Garagiola as co-host, NBC's ``Today'' show last week suffered its
lowest ratings in nearly seven years, according to Nielsen audience
estimates Thursday.
   While ABC's ``Good Morning America'' won its 29th consecutive
ratings victory with a 4.2 average, ``Today'' was well behind with
a 2.9, its lowest average since the week of Aug. 6, 1983, when it
had a 2.8 average.
   ``CBS This Morning'' show remained a distant third with a 2.2
average. All three shows declined by a tenth of a point from the
previous week.
   ``Today'' is attempting to recover from a ratings slide that
began in January after 13-year veteran Jane Pauley left the show.
She was its co-host when it hit its previous ratings low in 1983.
   As part of its comeback bid, ``Today'' added the popular
Garagiola as a third co-host in June, has moved to a larger studio
at NBC headquarters, and plans another change in September, a new
set.
   Comparisons for ratings for last week and the same week in 1989
show that ``Good Morning America'' increased its audience by a big
margin, 420,000 homes, while ``Today'' audience was down by 754,000
homes.
   The ratings for ``CBS This Morning'' were unchanged, but the
show was seen in 37,400 more homes than in the same week last year.
   A ratings point currently represents 921,000 homes, compared
with 904,000 homes last year.

   Thousands of quarters spilled through an

across the Ross Island Bridge.
   ``Quarters were flyin' everywhere,'' said Allen Schmuck, who,
with his friend, Tod Larsen, was traveling across the bridge
Wednesday when three bags fell out of the truck.
   Traffic was stopped for about 20 minutes on the bridge, one of
several spanning the Willamette River in Portland.
   The truck from Oregon Armored Service Inc. stopped right away
and police arrived within five minutes.
   ``There must have been $2,000 to $3,000 worth of quarters spread
all over for about 30 yards,'' said Terry Barker, a Portland
traffic officer. A shovel and broom were used to gather the coins.
   Company officials declined to say how many quarters were
involved, but police said no money was stolen.

   The Bush administration could balance the
federal budget if it raised the taxes of Americans with incomes of
more than $200,000, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo said Thursday.
   ``If you want to find wealth, don't come to us and take it out
of the pockets of children,'' Cuomo said. ``Don't come to us and
take it out of the pockets of the people who are trying to run the
drug programs.''
   Cuomo made his comments at a news conference with state and
local officials concerned that federal budget negotiators are
considering eliminating state and local taxes as a deduction.
   That, the state and local officials said, would constitute
double taxation and an infringement on states' rights.
   Earlier Thursday, Sen. Robert Packwood said a $10,000 cap on
state and local tax deductibility would unduly hurt the rich.
   Packwood, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance
Committee, said 97.4 percent of the losers under such a plan would
be people with incomes over $100,000 and 86 percent of the losers
would be people with incomes over $200,000.
   ``If that isn't a tax on the wealthy, I don't know what is,''
Packwood said.
   However, Cuomo advocated raising federal taxes for the
wealthiest Americans.
   ``It hurts nobody, it's fair to everybody and it avoids this
kind of calamity,'' said Cuomo, who has been mentioned as a
possible contender for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination.
   Administration and congressional negotiators have been meeting
for 11 weeks to try to agree on a budget package. On Wednesday,
most GOP leaders involved in the talks backed a new White House
proposal.
   The new administration proposal would raise about $3 billion by
limiting the deductibility of state and local income taxes on
federal tax returns, a GOP bargainer said Thursday. Such deductions
would be limited to no more than $10,000, said the negotiator, who
asked not to be identified.
   Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees, said the Reagan administration also
tried to raise revenues in 1985 by ending deductibility.
   ``And again, the attack is a thinly veiled attempt to preserve
the incredible shift of tax burden from the wealthy to the middle
class,'' he said. ``It's a shell game _ a way to pass off the
federal deficit onto the budgets of states and localities.''
   William J. Althaus, the Republican mayor of York, Pa., said:
``It's stupid, it's unfair and it suffers from what I can only call
incomplete candor on the part of the government.''
   Democratic Mayor David N. Dinkins said he recently balanced New
York City's budget by raising local taxes.
   ``One of the reasons we did so is because of the deductibility
of those taxes,'' he said.

<HEAD>Senate Adds $20 Million to Farm Bill to Stop Zebra Mussel Spread</HEAD>

   The Senate has approved a $20 million research
and prevention program to keep zebra mussels from invading farm
irrigation systems.
   The striped mollusk, which is not native to North America, has
caused problems at water and power plants throughout the Great
Lakes. They attach to water intake pipes and clog them.
   An amendment authorizing the $20 million over five years was
added to the 1990 farm bill by Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y.
   ``Unlike other infestations, this one is irreversible,''
Moynihan said in a statement Thursday. ``The zebra mussel is here
to stay ... Within 20 years' time it will have spread through the
entire surface water system of North America.''
   The amendment, which the Senate passed late Wednesday, directs
the Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
to develop a program of research, prevention and design criteria
for irrigation systems with an emphasis on keeping the mussels out.
   On Wednesday, scientists expressed surprise that the tiny
mollusks are spreading through the Erie Canal system from Buffalo,
N.Y., and now threaten Rochester, N.Y. and the Finger Lakes region.
   ``Frankly, I did not think their advance would be this fast,''
said Cameron Lange, a biologist studying the mussels' movement for
a consortium of power companies.
   ``I thought we might find a few at Lockport during our late July
sample but I did not think they'd reach Rochester by now.''
   Rochester is about 60 miles east of Lockport, N.Y.
   In May, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works
authorized $37.5 million in grants and research funding for control
of the mussel. The provision is part of the pending Water Resources
Development Act of 1990.

   Late buses would mean free rides, under a
plan being considered by the Southern California Rapid Transit
District board to lure passengers.
   ``We're going to put our money where our mouth is,'' board
President Nick Patsaouras said Wednesday. ``I am positive our
ridership will increase ... and if it (costs) a million or two, so
be it. We're making a long-term investment.''
   If the board approves the four-month pilot program, a free ride
would be given to passengers whose bus is more than 15 minutes late
beginning Sept. 1. If riders have monthly passes, credit would be
given toward the purchase of the next month's pass.
   Ridership has fallen from 1.8 million passengers a day to 1.3
million per day during the past five years, Patsaouras said.
   The Rapid Transit District, which operates in Los Angeles,
Orange and Riverside counties, will evaluate the on-time
performances of the buses at year's end.

<HEAD>EPA, Lawmakers Criticize Eased Rules on Low-Level Radioactive
Wastes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The easing of federal controls on low-level
atomic wastes poses public health concerns, the Environmental
Protection Agency said Thursday, while lawmakers said the new
policy could make some states into dumping grounds for radioactive
garbage.
   The decision last month by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to
deregulate some low-level atomic wastes from laboratories,
hospitals and nuclear plants came under attack at a hearing by the
House Interior energy and environment subcommittee.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., the subcommittee chairman, accused
the NRC of ``coziness'' with the nuclear industry and said if the
commission does not reverse its policy Congress should protect
states from being forced to accept such wastes in landfills.
   At least two states _ including Pennsylvania and Maine _ already
have enacted laws specifically prohibiting radioactive wastes in
conventional landfills. The NRC, however, has maintained that
federal policy overrides state and local statutes.
   Under the policy announced June 27, low-level wastes including
gloves, clothing, lab equipment, dirt and even buildings and
equipment at nuclear power plants can be disposed of as if they
were normal garbage _ if radiation doses are below a certain level.
   NRC Chairman Kenneth Carr told the subcommittee that the issue
is one of ``how safe is safe enough'' and promised that ``the
public and the environment will remain properly protected.''
   But Miller said the easing of federal requirements on such
wastes ``has the potential to endanger the public health'' and is
``an open invitation to abuse by unscrupulous operators'' who want
to dispose of radioactive materials.
   Some states that already are targets of out-of-state garbage
shipments fear they ``will become the dumping ground'' for
radioactive wastes, said Rep. Joe Rahall, D-W.Va. He added if that
becomes the case ``I fear there will be an all-out rebellion in
West Virginia.''
   Miller's subcommittee released internal documents showing that
both the EPA and some NRC staff advisers have strongly opposed the
NRC policy because they believe it covers too broad a range of
low-level wastes. The exemption from federal regulation would apply
to wastes that subject individuals to radiation doses of less than
10 millirems a year _ half the level of a normal chest X-ray.
   ``We believe that is too high a level (of exposure) for a
blanket deregulation criteria and is not protective of the public
health,'' the EPA's Office of Radiation Programs concluded in a
briefing paper made public by the subcommittee.
   The EPA estimated that the 10-millirem threshold for regulatory
action could result in as many as three additional cancer deaths
for every 10,000 people exposed.
   Richard Guimond, director of the Office of Radiation Programs,
testified that one concern is the possible cumulative effect of the
disposal of such wastes. A single landfill, for example, may
contain numerous categories of wastes, each of which would be
exempt because they individually meet the NRC cutoff for regulation.
   The EPA and some NRC staff members had urged that the cutoff be
much lower. Guimond noted that the International Atomic Energy
Agency considered an individual dose of 1 millirem per year as a
reasonable cutoff.
   Carr, the NRC chairman, said the agency would consider petitions
for exemptions on a case-by-case basis. But he said a relaxation of
controls on low-level wastes is needed to help return about 40
nuclear sites under NRC jurisdiction to general use. The Energy
Department also has sought a clearer policy from the NRC on
low-level wastes to help its cleanup of weapons plants.
   ``No human endeavor involves a zero level of risk,'' said Carr.
``The levels of radiation exposure we are talking about here, while
not zero, are exceedingly small.''

   A food server who urged a newspaper to
profile a 115-year-old man was fired from her job at the Council on
Aging because she was not authorized to contact the media,
officials said.
   Betty Scanlan, 60, earned $3.80 an hour serving lunch to about
10 senior citizens. She also set aside lunches for sailors who
delivered food to elderly patrons of the council's Meals on Wheels
program.
   Scanlan called the Pensacola News Journal after a sailor said he
delivered meals to a man who claimed to be 115.
   A reporter said she'd investigate the claim and also wanted to
write about Navy volunteers from Corry Station Technical Training
Center.
   ``I thought it would be great for the sailors to get a little
recognition ... I didn't think it'd be such a disaster,'' Scanlan
said Wednesday.
   On July 18, Scanlan accompanied the reporter to a church where
sailors were picking up meals.
   Later that day, Scanlan was fired because personnel policy
stipulates that only the council's chairman, executive director and
project directors ``may officially represent the agency in making
public announcements, speeches and comments about agency
business,'' council officials said.
   The newspaper has yet to run the stories.

   The House today reprimanded a repentant Rep.
Barney Frank for his official actions on behalf of a male
prostitute. Lawmakers first rejected more severe punishments
proposed by Republicans.
   ``I'm here to offer an apology and an explanation,'' the
Massachusetts Democrat told a hushed audience shortly before the
408-18 vote for reprimand. He said he took some of the actions
cited by the ethics committee ``to conceal my homosexuality.''
   ``I should have known better. I do now, but it's a little too
late,'' said a subdued Frank, who acknowledged his homosexuality
publicly in 1987, a year after the events that led to the House
probe.
   The vote against expulsion, proposed by Rep. William Dannemeyer,
R-Calif., was 390-38. The vote against censure, proposed by GOP
Whip Newt Gingrich, was 287-141. Censure would have stripped Frank
of his Judiciary subcommittee chairmanship.
   The reprimand, which was recommended by the House ethics
committee, carries no penalty other than the vote by Frank's
colleagues.
   ``This should not be perceived as a referendum on purely private
conduct or lifestyle,'' said Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., chairman
of the House ethics committee. ``The recommendation before the
House today I think is consistent with prior precedents.''
   Dannemeyer said Frank had knowingly permitted his apartment to
be used as a house of prostitution _ charges that the Massachusetts
Democrat has denied and that the House ethics committee found
groundless.
   ``Are there standards in our society that we will affirm for
ourselves and our children? That's the issue,'' Dannemeyer said.
   Frank has admitted he fixed parking tickets and wrote a
misleading memo for Stephen Gobie, whom the lawmaker first paid for
sex and later hired as a personal assistant using his own money.
   It was the second time in two days that Congress had acted to
discipline one of its own. On Wednesday, the Senate voted 96-0 to
denounce Sen. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., for financial
improprieties, and ordered him to repay up to $123,000.
   Like Durenberger, Frank is popular with his fellow lawmakers.
The Democratic leadership expressed confidence in advance the House
would do no more than issue an official reprimand.
   Some Republicans decided to make Frank's behavior an
election-year issue, though.
   Frank ``is not who is on trial today,'' said Dannemeyer. ``It is
the House of Representatives who is on trial today.''
   The question, Dannemeyer said, is ``do we tolerate, do we
condone a member of this body who knowingly permits a house of
prostitution to be operated out of his residence?''
   Dixon called Dannemeyer's statements ``selective garbage.''
   ``The committee's responsibility was to sort out fact from
fiction and 12 men in this House _ six Republicans and six
Democrats _ have tried to do that in this report,'' Dixon said
during floor debate with Frank looking on fromthe Democratic side
of the aisle. Dannemeyer ``insults the intelligence and the
literacy of the members of this House who have read this report.''
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, members of the ethics committee,
many fellow Democrats, and a homosexual rights group support
Frank's position that a reprimand is appropriate.
   Rep. John Myers of Indiana, the ranking Republican on the ethics
committee, said he supported the reprimand recommendation and hoped
the debate would not be partisan.
   ``This is a discipline matter,'' Myers said. ``It isn't a party
position. It isn't something that should be decided on a partisan
basis. It's entirely too important for that.''
   The 12-member ethics committee, split evenly between Democrats
and Republicans, dismissed charges that Frank was aware Gobie was
operating a prostitution ring out of Frank's Capitol Hill apartment
in 1987. Frank has said he immediately kicked Gobie out of his
apartment when he learned about the illicit business.
   Instead, the committee cited Frank for sending a misleading memo
to a Virginia prosecutor who was overseeing Gobie's probation on a
sex and drug felony conviction. The panel said the 1986 memo could
be interpreted as an attempt to persuade authorities to be lenient
toward Gobie.
   The committee also said Frank improperly used his congressional
authority to avoid paying 33 parking tickets, some of them run up
by Gobie while on personal business.
   Among those lobbying on Frank's behalf was the Human Rights
Campaign Fund, the nation's largest gay and lesbian organization.
   ``We're concerned that Congressman Frank is being held to a
higher standard than any member of Congress has been held to,''
said Gregory King, a spokesman for the group.

<HEAD>Commons Breaks Up For Summer After Tough Session For Thatcher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House of Commons began a 10-week recess on
Thursday after a turbulent session marked by Cabinet upheavals,
disputes over Europe and a slump in Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's fortunes.
   Her ratings are better than they were in the early spring when
she trailed the opposition Labor Party by 23 percentage points in
the polls. But her Conservative Party remains an average of 12
percentage points behind Labor.
   Inflation, widely seen as the key to Mrs. Thatcher's hopes of
winning an unprecedented fourth successive term, is running at
nearly 10 percent, despite two years of steep increases in interest
rates to curb it.
   Conservative Party popularity has tended to decline as interest
rates rise.
   But what lay behind two dramatic resignations from her 22-member
Cabinet in the past nine months was not unpopularity with the
electorate but differences within the party over the quickening
pace toward closer political and monetary union of the European
Community.
   With the departure of two other longtime Cabinet ministers for
what they describe as family reasons, Mrs. Thatcher has had to
reshuffle the government ranks half a dozen times since the
parliamentary session opened in the fall.
   Conservative Party Chairman Kenneth Baker, musing Thursday over
the chances of Mrs. Thatcher winning again, said: ``We've a long
way to go.''
   Since winning power in 1979, the prime minister has led the
party to two subsequent general election victories.
   ``We've come through much more difficult phases than this,''
Baker added in a radio interview. ``We were massively unpopular in
1981 and we won the '83 election. We were massively unpopular in
'86 and won the '87 election. We're not as unpopular now. ... We're
in very good shape to win this (next) election.''
   Mrs. Thatcher must call the next election by mid-1992, but 1991
is more likely if inflation is falling.
   There is some good news for the 64-year-old British leader.
There are signs that an unpopular new local government tax, the
so-called poll tax, which provoked riots this spring, is becoming
less of an issue.
   And the government also is pumping money into the problem with a
$5.4 billion special grant announced this month designed to head
off another rise next year.
   The tax, averaging $690 annually for each adult, has already
pushed average household bills up by one-third, and its
introduction this spring helped send the Thatcher ratings plunging.
   The Cabinet upheavals began in the fall. Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson, the top treasury official, quit when Mrs.
Thatcher refused to fire a part-time adviser who shared her
wariness about linking the pound to other major European currencies.
   This month, Trade Secretary Nicholas Ridley, a fellow
right-winger and probably her closest ally in the Cabinet, resigned
after making anti-German remarks.
   His assertions that European monetary union was a ``German
racket to take over Europe,'' and that ceding British sovereignty
to the European Community was like surrendering to Hitler caused a
furor.
   They also provided an embarrassing reminder of Mrs. Thatcher's
often uneasy relations with the rest of the 12-nation community and
prompted speculation that _ despite her swift rejection of Ridley's
remarks _ she secretly shares his views.
   ``She has to watch her back, every politician does, and her back
is Europe,'' David Owen, a former Labor foreign secretary and
leader of the now defunct Social Democratic Party, told a gathering
of U.S. reporters recently.
   Meanwhile, another ex-Cabinet minister and pro-European, former
Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine, is running an undeclared
campaign for the party leadership. Polls show that Heseltine, 57,
is the favorite to succeed her.
   However, Mrs. Thatcher has notably softened her stance on Europe
in the past few months, seeking to avoid isolation and pressing
with greater diplomacy her opposition to greater centralization.
   ``She is a superb psychiatrist,'' Owen said. ``There is only one
card Heseltine has to play and that's the European one. If she
offends the majority of pro-Europeans in the Conservative Party,
then he is back with a chance.''

   On a White House lawn crowded with people in
wheelchairs, President Bush signed landmark legislation Thursday
banning discrimination against the nation's 43 million disabled.
   ``Every man, woman and child with a disability can now pass
through once-closed doors into a bright new era of equality,
independence and freedom,'' Bush said as he signed the Americans
with Disabilities Act.
   He called it ``another Independence Day, one that is long
overdue.''
   The crowd of more than 3,000 that spilled across the South Lawn
was the largest ever at a White House bill-signing ceremony, said
deputy press secretary Alixe Glen.
   Many of those attending were disabled, and they applauded loudly
as Bush said the law will ban discrimination in the workplace,
assure access to restaurants, hotels and shopping centers, expand
access to public buses and rail systems, and require telephone
companies to provide special services for the deaf.
   The law bans discrimination against people with disabilities,
including AIDS, and defines the disabled as anyone with a mental or
physical impairment limiting ``some major life function.''
   Bush invoked the opening words of the Declaration of
Independence, saying, ``we are keeping faith with the spirit of our
courageous forefathers who wrote ... `that all men are created
equal.'''
   ``Tragically, for too many Americans, the blessings of liberty
have been limited or even denied,'' Bush said.
   The president likened the Americans with Disabilities Act to the
dismantling of the Berlin Wall. The law ``takes a sledgehammer to
another wall,'' he said.
   ``We will not accept, we will not excuse, we will not tolerate
discrimination in America,'' Bush said.
   When he sat down at a table to sign the bill with a flourish of
ceremonial pens, many in the crowd rose for a better view, only to
sit quickly back down as those in wheelchairs called out, ``Down in
front!''
   Bush offered the fourth and last pen to the Rev. Harold Wilke,
75, an armless United Church of Christ minister from Claremont,
Calif., who had delivered an invocation that spoke of ``the
breaking of the chains which have held back millions of Americans
with disabilities.''
   Wilke, who teaches at Union Seminary in New York City, suggested
the pen go instead to Ginny Thornburgh, wife of the attorney
general and a longtime activist for the disabled.
   ``The president said, `All right, I'll give it to Ginny, but
I'll give you mine,''' Wilke said later.
   As Bush reached into his pocket, Wilke deftly slipped his foot
out of his loafer, took the pen with his toes and slipped it back
into his shoe. A moment later, seated beside Barbara Bush, he put
the pen into his pocket.
   Those watching the ceremony were enthusiastic.
   ``It's just fantastic. It's a tremendously exhilarating
feeling,'' said Gordon Anthony, 35, an activist from Los Angeles in
a wheelchair from a spinal cord injury.
   Anthony is a successful marketing consultant, but he said the
law ``may open doors for what I do in my future career. There may
be better opportunities.''
   ``Employers are going to start reaching out to the disabled,''
he said.
   Maggie Behle, 10, of Salt Lake City, darted nimbly through the
crowd on a single crutch. She was born with one leg, but is a
downhill ski racer.
   Her mother, Sue Behle, boasted that Maggie has encountered few
obstacles she cannot overcome, but the Behles have a second
daughter, Kate, 15, who is autistic and retarded.
   Mrs. Behle, who works with a state agency for the handicapped,
said she hopes the Americans with Disabilities Act ``will mean that
Kate can have a job, that she can be employed.''
   Karen Friedman of the Human Rights Campaign Fund, which lobbies
for gay causes, called it a ``very historic day because it will
stop discrimination against people with AIDS and HIV infection.''
   The disabilities bill includes sanctions for those who
discriminate in hiring. It allows victims of employment
discrimination to seek back pay, reinstatement and attorneys' fees.
However, the law exempts businesses with fewer than 15 employees
from the hiring provisions.
   To businesses worried about the new mandates, Bush called the
disabled ``a tremendous pool'' of potential workers ``who will
bring to jobs diversity, loyalty, proven low turnover rate and only
one request: the chance to prove themselves.''
   Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., who lost use of his right arm in World
War II, said the law was ``a giant step forward.''
   ``It will be some burden'' on business, Dole said, ``but it's
going to make it much easier'' for America's disabled.

<TEXT>
   Nearly all American Indians are
descendants of a single small band of pioneers who walked across
what's now the Bering Strait from Asia 15,000 to 30,000 years ago,
a genetics researcher said Thursday.
   The descendants of this hardy group make up 95 percent of
American Indians, including the Mayans, Incas and many other spread
throughout North, Central and South America. The exceptions are the
Eskimos and Aleuts of the Arctic rim, the Navajos, Apaches and a
few others who arrived later, said Douglas Wallace of Emory
University in Atlanta.
   ``It was clearly a small migration,'' Wallace said of the
ancestral group. He based his findings on studies of the genes that
are related to the body's energy production. The genes were
extracted from blood samples from members of three different Indian
groups.
   In a presentation during a genetics course at the Jackson
Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Wallace also reported using the same
energy-producing genes _ called mitochondria _ to identify for the
first time the cause of a form of epilepsy.
   The mitochondrial genes, which are separate from the body's
other genes, are passed on to children only by mothers, not by
fathers.
   Studies of the genes allow researchers to trace maternal
ancestry, Wallace explained.
   The research on American Indians showed that the vast majority
descended from four women in that original migrating group.
   ``That's a striking finding,'' said Michael Silverstein, an
anthropologist at the University of Chicago who studies American
Indian languages.
   If the finding is confirmed, Silverstein said, it significantly
extends the conclusions about Indian origins that can be made using
language studies.
   In March, anthropologists met in Boulder, Colo., to debate a
suggestion by Joseph Greenberg of Stanford University that most
American Indian languages derived from one ancestral language.
   That controversial view is supported by Wallace's studies, which
trace most American Indians to the migration of a single small
group of people who presumably spoke the same language, Wallace
said.
   Other researchers have identified up to 200 linguistic groups,
said Greenberg. That would suggest there had been many separate
migrations or that the migrations occurred so long ago that the
original language had had time to split into many different forms.
   Wallace said his data argues strongly against those
possibilities.
   Wallace is trying to determine when the small group of Indian
pioneers lived. The land bridge across the Bering Strait existed
from about 30,000 years ago, when the glaciers that covered it
receded, until about 15,000 years ago, when the glaciers melted and
water covered the bridge.
   He hopes to establish the time of migration using techniques to
find how much time it took for the ancestors' genes to diversify to
the way they are among Indians today.
   The studies might also be used to test the longshot theory that
American Indians descended from Polynesians who managed to migrate
from their islands in the south and central Pacific.
   Wallace, one of the leading authorities on mitochondrial genes,
has linked them to several unusual inherited diseases, including
one called myoclonic epilepsy and ragged-red fiber disease, or
MERRF.
   The discovery that the disease is related to a genetic defect in
the mitochondria underscores the importance of these ``little
fireplaces in the body,'' Wallace said.
   ``It's the first epilepsy that's ever been worked out at the
molecular level,'' Wallace said.
   He was able to show that this disease, which can produce severe,
handicapping muscle spasms, is inherited. Its origin until now has
been unknown, Wallace said.
   Although the discovery will not lead immediately to a new
treatment, it is an important step toward that goal, he said.
Preliminary success has been obtained in treating other
mitochondrial diseases, he said.
   Wallace also has suggested that the accumulation of defects in
the mitochondria during aging could be a cause of the body's normal
degeneration, although that hypothesis remains to be examined.
   ``As we age, our mitochondrial activity is declining,'' he said.
Organs that depend heavily on energy _ such as the brain and the
heart _ are among the organs that begin to fail in old age, he said.

   Iraq scaled back a weeklong intimidation
campaign against Kuwait on Thursday and began preparing for direct
talks with its neighbor on ending a bitter dispute over land rights
and oil production.
   Travelers returning from the border area said there were fewer
weapons on display.
   Diplomatic sources in the Persian Gulf said Iraq had agreed to
remove extra troops reportedly deployed along the disputed border.
   Iraq denied ever increasing its military strength in the area,
despite reports from diplomats and the media that it moved as many
as 30,000 men to the border.
   Iraqi newspaper officials said they received instructions from
the ministry of information Wednesday night to halt propaganda
attacks on Kuwait as part of an agreement to defuse the crisis.
   An Iraqi official said representatives of Iraq and Kuwait would
start direct negotiations in the Saudi Arabian port of Jiddah on
Saturday or Sunday.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak sent an adviser to Baghdad and
Kuwait to help organize the talks.
   Diplomatic sources in Cairo said the meeting would be between
oil and financial experts, who would outline the countries'
differences and make suggestions to their governments for solving
them, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
   In Jiddah, the 46-member Organization of Islamic Conference
urged the two member states to resolve their differences
peacefully. It warned that any escalation of tension might bring
foreign intervention to the region, especially from Israel.
   The Iraqi source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had not backed down on demands that
Kuwait cut oil production, pay for oil Baghdad claims Kuwait stole,
and forget billions of dollars in wartime loans to Iraq.
   Saddam has demanded Kuwait compensate Iraq for $2.4 billion
worth of oil he accused Kuwait of stealing from an oil field that
includes land claimed by both countries.
   The disputed Rumaila oil field extends two miles into Kuwait,
but Iraq claims it owns the entire field.
   Saddam also claims Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates deprived
his nation of $14 billion in revenue by exceeding their OPEC
production quotas and depressing the international price of crude
oil. He threatened to use force against OPEC cheaters. Kuwait and
and U.A.E. deny that they have cheated.
   In a move that could help soothe Iraqi anger, OPEC ministers
were expected Friday to sign an agreement to raise the cartel's
price of crude oil and try to limit production.
   Under the proposal, Kuwait and the U.A.E. would be limited to
producing 1.5 million barrels a day. Analysts say each has been
pumping about 2 million barrels a day.

   A ceiling fan distributor said Thursday it is
recalling 10,000 of the fans because of a defect that can cause the
blades to separate from the motor.
   ``Builders Square said these ceiling fans are equipped with
metal fan blade bracket holders which may break, allowing the blade
to separate from the motor while the fan is in use,'' said the
Consumer Product Safety Commission.
   The company has received seven customer complaints, one
reporting a minor injury, involving its fans, the agency said.
   The voluntary recall involves eight models of 52-inch ``Bay
Breeze'' ceiling fans distributed by Builders Square, Inc. of San
Antonio.
   The fans, sold with and without lights, were distributed
nationwide from October 1989 until two months ago.
   Consumers should stop using the fans and return them to any
Builders Square store for a refund or call the company at
1-800-634-5949.

Treaty</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is dragging its feet
on a proposed U.S. treaty that calls for eliminating human rights
abuses against women around the world, members of Congress said
Thursday.
   Rep. Gus Yatron, D-Pa., head of a House human rights
subcommittee, said the United States is one of the few developed
countries that has not ratified the Convention on the Elimination
of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.
   Joining Yatron in criticism was Rep. Douglas Bereuter, R-Neb. He
said the United States tarnished its image in the eyes of other
nations by failing to act on the U.N. convention that was signed a
decade ago. He said the measure has been ratified by more than 100
countries.
   ``Abuse against women takes a number of forms, from denial of
access to education to physical mutilation and even death,'' Yatron
said at a hearing.
   ``The human rights situation of women has been largely an
invisible issue,'' he said. ``It is the purpose of these hearings
to bring women's rights into the mainstream of our human rights
policy.''
   Jackie Wolcott, deputy assistant secretary of State, said as a
first step the Bush administration wants the Senate to ratify
another convention banning torture. Treaties must be ratified by
two-thirds of the Senate.
   Meantime, she said the State Department has asked the Justice
Department to review the convention to determine whether any of its
provisions conflict with current law.
   ``The process of determining which human rights conventions
should be recommended for ratification will undoubtedly be
time-consuming,'' she said. ``However, we hope that it will proceed
without undue delay following approval of the torture convention.''
   Paula Dobriansky, the deputy secretary of State for human
rights, said the administration believes the U.S. priority ``must
be on the reform of governmental policies and institutions
responsible for those abuses.''
   Ms. Dobriansky testified that many countries continue to single
out women for abuse.
   In India, for example, more than 2,000 women were killed _
usually burned _ in ``dowry deaths'' in 1988. Their crime? They
couldn't meet the property demands of their husband's families.
   In Iran, women have been raped before being executed and
tortured after giving birth, according to testimony obtained by the
United Nations.
   In Brazil, women often from the lower classes are killed and
assaulted with virtual impunity in crimes of passion because a
man's ``honor'' is so important.
   In Africa, the painful, unhygienic practice of genital
mutilation, usually circumcision, continues in various countries.
   In China, reports of forced abortion and sterilization continue
as the country attempts to rein in its population growth.
   These and other examples were brought up at a congressional
hearing focusing on human rights abuses against women around the
world.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Says Western Aid Needed to Continue Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Thursday his
country needs Western aid to rebuild its consumer industries in the
next two critical years of reform.
   Speaking to reporters following a meeting with Italian Premier
Guilio Andreotti, Gorbachev also said NATO's steps to transform
itself were crucial in his decision not to block a united Germany's
membership in the Western alliance.
   He also warmly praised Pope John Paul II, and did not exlude a
papal visit to the Soviet Union.
   Andreotti, as president of the European Community for the last
half of 1990, has been Europe's point man on the issue of providing
assistance to the Soviet Union. He has said he believes Gorbachev's
reform program cannot succeed without a rapid infusion of Western
aid.
   The question of Italian financial credits to the Soviet Union
was discussed in the meetings, Andreotti said, but no agreements
were reached.
   Gorbachev has said his 5-year-old reform program would have to
show results in the next two years or the Soviet leadership should
quit.
   The consumer market is in disarray. There are shortages
everywhere of basic consumer goods and food items, and many regions
have gone to rationing or limiting sales to those who can prove
local residence.
   Asked how foreign assistance could help, Gorbachev said the
Soviet Union must move to convert its defense industries to
peaceful production, produce more food and consumer goods for the
market, and give factories a chance to work with foreign firms to
boost their productivity.
   ``In these two years, in which we will have to make the most
difficult changes, we need this kind of help,'' Gorbachev said.
Some aid should be provided quickly ``to reduce the difficulty of
the problems, and so perestroika does not slow down,'' he said.
   But the Soviet Union ``cannot depend on foreign sponsors'' to
fix its economy, and aid to Moscow will not be ``a handout,'' he
said.
   Andreotti said assistance to the Soviet Union could help
stabilize all of Europe.
   The West German government has guaranteed $3.1 billion in bank
loans to the Soviet Union, and together with France pushed the
European Community to endorse an immediate $15 billion aid program.
   President Bush says providing Moscow with Western advisers and
know-how would help more than economic aid until the Soviet Union
makes more changes in its economy and cuts down assistance to
countries like Cuba.
   Gorbachev was asked about the Soviet decision, announced by last
week, to refrain from trying to block a united Germany's membership
in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He credited NATO
compromises.
   Meeting in London, NATO leaders agreed to reduce the alliance's
dependence on nuclear weapons and to study changes in its forces
and military strategy.
   ``I am sure that if there had been no London declaration ... it
would have been very difficult to formulate our declaration,''
Gorbachev said.
   Asked by reporters after the news conference about the
possibility of a papal visit to the Soviet Union, Gorbachev said:
``Of course, everything is possible.''
   The Soviet Union had received ``good words'' from the Vatican
through the visiting Italian officials, Gorbachev said.
   Gorbachev has been criticized by traditionalist Communist
officials for establishing relations with the Vatican and meeting
with the pope on a visit to Italy last December.

   The girlfriend of Bruce Springsteen,
who sang ``Born to Run'' and `Born in the U.S.A.,'' has given birth
to the rock balladeer's first child _ a boy _ Springsteen's lawyer
said Thursday.
   Patti Scialfa, a back-up singer in Springsteen's band, delivered
the 7-pound, 9-ounce boy at a California hospital sometime since
Tuesday, said lawyer Barry Slott of Asbury Park.
   Slott did not know the boy's name, the name of the hospital or
the condition of the mother or child.
   Springsteen, 40, and Scialfa, 38, were rumored to be linked
romantically after she joined his E Street Band as a backup singer
in 1984 for the ``Born in the U.S.A.'' tour.
   ``The Boss'' married model-actress Julianne Phillips on May 13,
1985, but their divorce became effective in March 1989.
   Like Springsteen, Scialfa is a New Jersey native. Springsteen
has been reported to be producing her first solo album.

<HEAD>East Germany's Former Secret Police Chief Goes to Jail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany on Thursday jailed the former
chief of the Communist secret police on suspicion he had hidden
some of the world's most notorious terrorists.
   However, officials said deposed Communist leader Erich Honecker
was too sick to prosecute on allegations of abuse of office and
corruption.
   Authorities arrested 82-year-old Erich Mielke, who ran the
sprawling foreign and domestic spy network that touched nearly
every East German and bolstered Honecker's 19 years of iron-fisted
rule.
   Mielke was held pending investigation of charges he abused his
power, jailed people for criticizing the old regime, and turned
East Germany into a haven for left-wing terrorists linked to some
of the most spectacular attacks of the past two decades.
   The government said even though the allegations against Honecker
would justify a similar criminal investigation, the 77-year-old
former leader's health is too precarious. He is suffering from
kidney cancer at a Soviet military hospital outside Berlin.
   Some leaders of the ousted regime were arrested late last year
or early this year but were freed because of poor health or
advanced age.
   East Germany's democratic government has changed its mind
several times about whether to prosecute the ousted Communists, and
whether to grant amnesty to most of the 100,000 people who worked
for its intelligence network.
   It is unclear how unification in December, when East Germany
will come under West Germany's justice system, will affect the
criminal investigations.
   The East Germany ADN news agency quoted Federal Prosecutor
Guenter Seidel as saying authorities had ``no other choice'' but to
arrest Mielke in light of the mounting evidence of complicity in
harboring terrorists.
   He added that medical difficulties still could stand in the way
of eventual prosecution of Mielke and other former officials. There
have been many reports in West German newspapers that Mielke's
mental state had deteriorated.
   Mielke's arrest follows a sensational string of allegations that
the former Communist government hid, trained and perhaps financed
notorious left-wing terrorists.
   Eight reputed members of the Red Army Faction, blamed for a
series of killings and bombings in West Germany in the 1970s and
1980s, were arrested in the past several week in East Germany.
   Some had been living there for more than a decade. All had
assumed names and phony identification papers. Some said they were
given housing and false identities by the former secret police.
   There have been numerous reports that several other terrorist
suspects regularly lived or traveled to East Germany with the
approval of authorities.
   Among them was Illich Ramirez Sanchez, the notorious ``Carlos
the Jackal,'' who masterminded the Dec. 21, 1975, kidnapping of 11
OPEC oil ministers and several other fatal attacks.
   Officials have said Mielke also personally aided Abu Daoud, the
Palestinian accused of orchestrating the massacre of 17 Israeli
athletes during the 1972 Olympics in Munich.
   Besides aiding leftist terrorists, the Stasi purportedly also
aided right-wing radicals, West German news reports have said
recently.
   In addition to East German allegations, West Germany is pursuing
murder charges against Honecker for his part in promulgating the
shoot-to-kill order that led to the deaths of at least 192 people
trying to flee from the old regime into West Germany.
   Besides Mielke, two other former Communist officials, labor
union chief Harry Tisch and party economist Guenter Mittag, have
been judged competent to face an investigation.

<HEAD>Massachusetts' Ongoing Chaos Could Ripple into Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Massachusetts Legislature has become mired in
political gridlock, threatening to further damage an already weak
economy, analysts said Thursday.
   ``As long as chaos continues, there's always a tendency to
postpone making any kind of decisions,'' said David Wyss, an
economist at DRI-McGraw Hill in Lexington. ``That means businesses
are not expanding, people aren't making investments.''
   Lawmakers have been struggling for months to solve the state's
fiscal disaster. While the Legislature was gripped with political
paralysis, the state's budget deficit climbed above $1 billion and
the government bond ratings dropped to the nation's lowest.
   State officials hoped they were sending encouraging signs last
week when Gov. Michael S. Dukakis signed a $1.2 billion tax
package. That was followed by a legislative conference committee's
approval of a budget for the fiscal year that began July 1.
   But events grew out of control this week when House lawmakers
refused to agree to the budget, and then House leaders tried to
appease them by offering a substitute tax package. That maneuver
failed.
   Meantime, Standard and Poors, a major Wall Street bond rating
agency, was preparing an annual credit report on Massachusetts, to
be released Monday.
   Standard &amp; Poors last year gave Massachusetts a BBB bond rating,
lowest in the nation. Moody's Investors Service Inc. also has given
Massachusetts its lowest rating of any state.
   ``It's unfortunate that the budget delays persist,'' a statement
from S&amp;P said. The firm said it would have a comprehensive
evaluation of the state once the budget and the financing of last
year's deficit are resolved, along with the newly enacted tax
package.
   The protracted debate, itself, can hurt the state's credit
status, said Wyss, who follows bond rating issues.
   ``The basic problem is not the ability to pay, but a lack of
willingness to pay,'' he said. ``This is a further indication of
it.''
   The state economy, which started to weaken more than a year ago,
contributed to the fiscal crisis by shrinking tax collections. But
now the fiscal crisis is casting a shadow over the general economic
picture, some observers say.
   ``It has the heavy hand of depression on all of us,'' said James
Howell, a leading private economist in Boston.
   Howell has proposed some form of private sector intervention,
where members of the business community would work with legislators
to restructure the state's finances.
   ``There is a time when this fiscal crisis cannot be allowed to
continue,'' he said.
   Some political observers blamed a leadership vacuum in the House
for the inaction.
   Marty Linsky, a former GOP legislator now affiliated with
Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, said House Speaker
George Keverian traditionally has relied on personal friendships
rather than strong-armed tactics to win support.
   But because Keverian is now running for the Democratic
nomination for state treasurer, he ``has taken himself out,''
Linsky said. ``That gives him much less leverage.''

   Thursday was a better day for Dave Durenberger.
   Wednesday night, the Minnesota senator sat at a front-row desk
in the Senate chamber as colleagues stood one by one to vote for a
resolution formally denouncing him for financial misconduct.
   Thursday morning he was on the White House lawn, saluted by
President Bush along with a handful of fellow senators for their
efforts in passing a popular bill barring discrimination against
disabled Americans.
   Durenberger waded into the crowd on the White House's South
Lawn, his red, white and blue tie emblazoned with tiny wheelchairs,
to greet dozens of men, women and children in wheelchairs. Later he
crouched to talk with a group of children, answering questions
about the new law.
   A Minneapolis station's TV camera took it all in, along with his
conversation with a polio-stricken Minnesota woman he brought to
Washington for the ceremony.
   A few minutes later, he took a plane to Vermont for the weekend
wedding of his third son, Michael.
   ``It was just meant to be,'' the Republican senator said over
and over about the morning's events, the day after the darkest
moment in his political career.
   Thursday morning, he awoke to see his picture splashed in
ignominy across newspaper front pages from coast to coast. And in
the Twin Cities, the Saint Paul Pioneer Press and WCCO-TV released
poll results that showed Durenberger's home-state approval rating
had plunged to 40 percent.
   But by 10 a.m. all that was pushed aside as Durenberger took his
seat at the White House and began what he hopes will be a return to
more routine Senate life.
   ``This is the real Dave Durenberger,'' he told reporters. ``This
is the kind of an event that I think is an opportunity to rejoice
in all the good things that I do as a United States senator.
   ``We've put a couple of bad things that I did a couple of years
ago behind. I do this sort of thing every day. I do it for a living
and I do it as a person. This is the good part of my life.''

<TEXT>
   ``Smoke on the Mountain'' is an evening of
musical theater as down-home and satisfying as the sweet potato pie
sold at intermission.
   It is the depiction of a gospel-singing family's Saturday
evening appearance at the Mount Pleasant Baptist Church, Mount
Pleasant, N.C., in 1938. It's made more dramatic and musically
varied than the real thing would have been but, except for a few
too many smirks from Kevin Chamberlin as Mervin Oglethorpe, the
resident preacher, it isn't condescending.
   ``Smoke on the Mountain'' has been running since May at the
off-Broadway Lamb's Theater.
   The acting, singing and instrumental musicianship of the actors
playing the Sanders family is astounding. Instead of one rural,
white gospel song after another, some of the songs are country,
blues and western swing. Everybody ``testifies,'' telling
interesting stories.
   Dan Manning, as Stanley, tells of disappointing his mother by
being the one of her five sons who went to prison. It might have
been the most hokey of the stories but was actually the most
touching.
   ``I like a good mother song,'' Rev. Oglethorpe had said earlier.
And Manning sang a dandy, ``They're All Going Home to Mother
Tonight (They're all going home but one).''
   Dennis (Robert Olsen) plays violin and his twin sister Denise
(Jane Potter) plays a tiny guitar. Burl, the dad, is played by
Reathel Bean who looks more rural than most farmers. He plays
guitar. Vera, the mom, (Linda Kerns), plants her feet wide, likes
to interrupt and plays piano.
   Stanley, Burl's brother, plays upright bass. Everybody switches
around on different instruments. But Manning, as Stanley, gets a
better tone on bass than anybody else and is also a dab hand with
mandolin and harmonica. The preacher, besides looking longingly at
the family daughters, throws himself into the singing from time to
time and once brings on his accordion.
   The audience joins in on ``Bringing in the Sheaves.''
   June Sanders, the twins' nonmusical sister, is played by Connie
Ray, who wrote ``Smoke on the Mountain.'' June is learning to sign
for the deaf, which the Mount Pleasant congregation doesn't need.
   The drama which ends Act 1 is the huffy exit from the amen
corner of two old maids when the Sanders girls ``move with the
spirit'' to ``There Is a Place Beyond the River of Life.'' ``We
don't dance here,'' screeches the preacher, trying to save the
evening.
   Alan Bailey, who directed, had the idea for ``Smoke on the
Mountain.'' It was first performed at the McCarter Theater in
Princeton, N.J., in 1988.
   Some of the songs will be familiar to those with a Protestant
upbringing. Familiar songs or not, the evening is a beguiling joy.

<TEXT>
   The producer of the ``thirtysomething''
television show sued star Timothy Busfield, claiming the actor has
threatened to boycott filming of the series' fourth season unless
he gets a raise.
   The suit, filed Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court by
MGM-UA Television Production Group Inc., alleges Busfield has
refused to report for work on Aug. 3, the start of filming for the
fall season. It asks a judge to order him to return to work.
   The suit alleged that Busfield wants to be paid $36,375 per
episode. MGM-UA said it offered the red-haired actor $28,750 for
each 1990-1991 installment of the popular series.
   ``MGM has failed to live up to their agreement with Mr.
Busfield,'' Edward Burg, the actor's attorney, responded Thursday.
``They are trying to coerce him into returning to work and he won't
be coerced.''
   Burg declined further comment.
   The suit claims Busfield, who also has appeared in feature films
including ``Field of Dreams,'' has breached his five-year contract
by threatening to stay off the set. It seeks unspecified
compensatory and punitive damages.
   It also seeks to bar the actor, who currently is starring on
Broadway in ``A Few Good Men,'' from appearing in movies,
television productions and theater plays until the dispute is
resolved.
   In opposition papers, Busfield's attorney alleged that such a
court-ordered injunction would prohibit the actor from earning a
living.
   Busfield portrays Elliot Weston in the ABC drama about the
everyday lives of a group of friends approaching middle age in
Pennsylvania. Busfield's character is married to Nancy, whose
battle with cancer is expected to be a crucial aspect of the new
season.
   ABC, ``thirtysomething'' supervising producer Scott Winant and
Busfield's agent all declined comment Thursday.

<HEAD>Six Indian Tribes Given Greater Control Over Finances</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRETCHEN COOK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of six Indian tribes on Thursday
formally accepted an Interior Department agreement that gives them
direct access to federal funds and more control over how to spend
them.
   The Self-Governance Demonstration Project is designed to test
whether the tribes can do a better job of managing their own
affairs than the federal government.
   Tribes from Washington, Oklahoma, California and Minnesota were
chosen to participate in the three-year program, which begins Oct.
1.
   Under the program, the tribes will get federal funds directly,
rather than through the Bureau of Indian Affairs. They will be free
to spend the money as they choose.
   The Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs reported last year
that very little of the $3.3 billion allocated for Indian programs
actually reached Indian people.
   ``This is a major step for the six tribes represented here
today,'' Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan said as he gave the tribal
leaders a copy of the agreement, which was signed July 3.
   ``Through their individual agreements, they are taking control
of their budgets, and they are setting priorities for future
development in their unique cultural communities,'' Lujan said.
   Participating in the program are the Quinault, Lummi and Klallam
tribes of Washington; the Hoopa tribe of California; the Cherokee
Nation of Oklahoma and the Chippewa's Mille Lacs Band of Minnesota.
   Lujan said that if the program is judged successful, it will be
extended to other tribes.
   The chairman of the Senate panel, Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii,
said the new system will allow tribes to target particular needs in
of health and education. It also will give them a new sense of
autonomy, he said.
   ``This ceremony here will bring in a new relationship, a United
States-Indian partnership,'' he said.
   The 1991 amounts are: Quinault, $3.9 million; Lummi $2.2
million; Hoopa Valley, $2 million; Jamestown Klallam, $687,000;
Cherokee, $6.1 million; and Mille Lacs $267,210. New annual funding
agreements will be negotiated for 1992 and 1993.
   Don Wedll of the Mille Lacs Band challenged the distribution of
the funds. He said Mille Lacs received $112 per member, while other
tribes received between $1,000 and $3,000 per member. Tribe
officials say 80 percent of the Mille Lacs Band live below the
federal poverty level.
   Wedll said the tribe is renegotiating its allotment with the
Interior Department.

<HEAD>New President Named for NBC's Cable Venture</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NBC on Thursday appointed senior network
executive Albert Barber to head the company's year-old cable
venture, the Consumer News and Business Channel.
   He replaces Michael Eskridge as CNBC president. Eskridge is
leaving to form a broadcast management company.
   CNBC is co-owned by NBC and Cablevision Systems Corp. of New
York's Long Island.
   The cable operation, based in Fort Lee, N.J., began in April
1989 with reported start-up costs of $65 million.
   CNBC has a staff of 275 and is seen in 16.8 million homes and
offices, about half the number served by its older rival, New
York-based Financial News Network.
   Barber said one of his top priorities ``is to get CNBC carried
around the world,'' but as a business, consumer and financial news
service, not as a rival to Cable News Network.
   ``This not not a general news network,'' Barber said of CNBC
which, unlike Ted Turner's 24-hour cable news service, is seen only
in the United States. CNN, established 10 years ago, is seen in 90
countries.
   Barber, 44, has been NBC's executive vice president and chief
financial officer since 1987. Before that, he served in various
managerial positions at General Electric Co., which bought NBC in
June 1986.
   CNBC still is running in the red and doesn't expect to turn a
profit until its fourth year, when executives hope it will have 30
million U.S. subscribers.
   Barber said a priority will be visiting cable operators who
don't carry CNBC to sell the service.
   He said he might consider changing CNBC's prime-time operations,
which consist mainly of interview shows, but added, ``we are very
pleased with our daytime programming'' of financial and business
news reports.
   CNBC in May hired Andrew Friendly, a former ``Entertainment
Tonight'' producer, to overhaul its prime-time programming.
   Unlike FNN, CNBC isn't yet carried by cable in Manhattan and
thus isn't seen by the influential Wall Street and advertising
crowd. But Barber said he will work hard to get it shown by
Manhattan cable operators.
   In trying to get CNBC a global audience, Barber said, he will
seek distribution in hotels and brokerage houses, among other
places.
   Last month, CNBC began that attempt with a three-week satellite
transmission of the service's programs to London and Paris, hoping
to interest cable and television companies in carrying CNBC.

   The military claimed Thursday that
fleeing Tamil rebels hacked and shot to death 41 Sinhalese and
Moslem villagers suspected of helping the army in Sri Lanka's civil
war.
   In a separate development in the south, unidentified assailants
shot to death 13 Sinhalese villagers, military officials said. They
said the killings could mean the resurgence of a Sinhalese
extremist group that believes the government has been too soft on
the Tamils.
   Rebels made no immediate comment on the military's charge they
killed 41 villagers. It was not possible to independently confirm
the report.
   The military officials, who cannot be identified under briefing
rules, said the killings occurred in five northern and eastern
villages on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne told reporters
government troops in the north and east have scattered guerrillas
of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
   ``The Tamil terrorists are on the run into the jungles, and in
desperation they want to kill as many as possible before they get
killed,'' Wijeratne said.
   The military officials said militants hacked and shot to death
19 Sinhalese villagers at midnight Wednesday in the northcentral
Medawahchiya district. They reported 20 people died but later said
one seriously injured man was mistaken for dead.
   They said 18 more Sinhalese and four Moslems were killed in four
attacks in the northeastern, northcentral and eastern districts.
Four rebels and a soldier were also reported killed in fighting.
   Most fighting in this nation off the southern tip of India is
concentrated below the northern peninsula of Jaffna, the militant
stronghold.
   Government troops Tuesday took control of a six-mile corridor
that connects the peninsula with the mainland.
   The peninsula has been under rebel control since the fighting
started June 11, which ended a 13-month-old cease-fire in the Tamil
war for a separate homeland.
   Since then, at least 2,900 combatants have been killed in the
fighting for control of the north and the east. Besides the
Sinhalese and Moslem deaths reported Thursday, a large but unknown
number of other civilians, including Tamils, have been killed.
   Military officials who reported the 13 killings in the south
said they suspected the Sinhalese extremist organization, the
People's Liberation Front.
   The gunmen dragged the victims out of their homes from Diyadawa
and Siyamablagoda villages and took them to jungles where they were
shot, said the officials. The bodies were later burned, they said.
   The victims were members of a peace committee appointed by the
government to oversee arms surrender by extremists of the front.
   If the Sinhalese radicals are responsible for the attack, it
would be the first by the front since its top leaders were killed
by security forces in December.
   The Sinhalese uprising started in 1987 to protest the
government's peace overtures to the Tamil separatists. The Tamil
rebellion started in 1983 with the separatist groups complaining of
discrimination by the Sinhalese majority.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people. The
majority Sinhalese, who control the government and military,
comprise 75 percent of the population.
   More than 13,500 people have been killed in the 7-year-old
ethnic war.

   The House voted 408-18 on Thursday to
reprimand Rep. Barney Frank for using his official influence on
behalf of a male prostitute. ``I should have known better,'' the
Massachusetts Democrat apologized.
   The vote came after the House overwhelmingly turned back
conservative Republican efforts to expel Frank or to censure him
and strip him of a subcommittee chairmanship.
   In a statement of contrition shortly before the vote, Frank said
he had taken some of the actions cited by the ethics committee in
part to ``conceal my homosexuality,'' which he later publicly
revealed. Frank said he knows better now ``but it's a little late.''
   Frank was punished for using his office to fix parking tickets
for prostitute Stephen L. Gobie, and for writing a misleading memo
designed to shorten Gobie's probation for sex and drug convictions.
The memo found its way to a Virginia prosecutor and the ethics
panel said it could have been perceived as an attempt to pressure
authorities.
   Frank first met Gobie when he hired him for sexual relations in
1985. He later employed him as a personal assistant, paying him out
of personal funds.
   Several lawmakers took pains to say they were not judging the
Massachusetts Democrat for his sexual preference.
   ``We are neither condemning today nor condoning that
lifestyle,'' said Rep. John T. Myers, R-Ind., the ranking
Republican on the House ethics committee, which is officially the
Committee on Standards of Official Conduct.
   The vote marked the second time in as many days that Congress
had meted out punishment to one of its own. On Wednesday, the
Senate denounced Sen. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., for financial
improprieties. On a vote of 96-0, the Senate also ordered him to
make restitution of up to $123,000.
   Frank was ordered to make restitution to the District of
Columbia for an unspecific amount to pay for the improperly
dismissed tickets.
   The House first voted 390-38 to reject a move by California Rep.
William Dannemeyer to expel Frank, a motion that required a
two-thirds vote and had not been expected to pass.
   More than an hour later, House members voted 287-141 against a
move by GOP Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia to censure the
Massachusetts Democrat, a move that would have stripped him of his
subcommittee chairmanship.
   ``We are here to repair the integrity of the House of
Representatives,'' Gingrich said.
   The 50-year-old Frank listened from a seat on the House floor as
his fate was debated, surrounded by his Democratic colleagues from
Massachusetts. Other members stopped by to pat the five-term
lawmaker on the back.
   He said in advance he would not contest the ethics committee
recommendation.
   In his floor speech, Frank called the memo he wrote during
Gobie's probation ``the most serious'' of his mistakes and
admitted, ``I shouldn't have written it. There was in my life a
central element of dishonesty for about 40 years. It had to do with
my private life. I did in that memorandum misrepresent the facts
because ... it was necessary to conceal my homosexuality.
   ``Three years ago, I decided that concealment didn't work.''
   Ethics committee chairman Julian C. Dixon, D-Calif., told the
House in pushing for a reprimand, ``We have set aside all of the
color, all of the filth, and examined the facts.''
   ``It is not Barney Frank's lifestyle that should be judged here
today, but rather what he did or did not do'' in his official
capacity.
   Another committee member, Republican Rep. Fred Grandy of Iowa,
said, ``We do not enhance or enshrine family values by damning
individuals whose lifestyles differ from our own. We are here to
prosecute, not persecute.''
   And Rep. Thomas Foglietta added, ``Barney Frank stands accused
of being stupid. If stupidity suddenly became the grounds for
expulsion from this body, there would be very few of us left here.''
   Voting for the reprimand were 244 Democrats and 164 Republicans.
Voting no were seven Democrats and 11 Republicans. Four members,
including Frank, voted present. It is traditional for lawmakers in
his situation to vote that way.
   The House has censured 22 members in its two-century history and
expelled only four. Six had been reprimanded before that action was
recommended for Frank.
   Dannemeyer, who needed a two-thirds vote and had not been
expected to succeed in his expulsion move, asked the House, ``Are
there standards in our society that we will affirm for ourselves
and our children? That's the issue.''
   Rep. Bob Dornan, R-Calif., said he had not intended to support
expulsion for Frank but changed his mind. ``I am going to vote for
expulsion because he didn't have the honor and decency to resign,''
he said.
   Dannemeyer accused the ethics committee of failing to see Frank
as a law breaker.
   He said Frank knew that Gobie was operating a prostitution ring
in the lawmaker's apartment, a conclusion that was contradicted by
the committee's finding that Frank was unaware of the business.
   Dixon called Dannemeyer's version of the facts ``the most
edited, selective garbage that has ever been put forth in my
opinion in this House.'' His remark was followed by a round of
applause.
   The ethics committee chairman said Dannemeyer announced months
ago he would move to expel Frank, when ``information on Congressman
Frank's lifestyle ... is the only information he had at the time.''
   Frank originally paid $80 for sexual relations with Gobie and
then hired him in 1985 as an assistant. Frank said he fired him in
1987 after learning of Gobie's activities in the lawmaker's
apartment.
   The committee accused him of improperly using his congressional
authority to avoid paying 33 parking tickets, incurred by Gobie
when he used Frank's car for personal business.

<HEAD>Dallas Museum to Store Stolen Medieval Art Until Ownership Settled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The heirs of an American soldier accused of
pilfering medieval art treasures from a German church during World
War II have given the trove to a Dallas museum for safekeeping
while their ownership is settled.
   The Quedlinburg treasures will not be displayed publicly at the
Dallas Museum of Art until the ownership is decided by a U.S.
District Court judge, museum director Richard R. Brettell said
Thursday.
   Brettell said professionals and scholars might be allowed to see
the treasures if the court and both sides in the lawsuit agree. The
public likely will get to see the art once ownership is clear.
   ``Each party was interested in eventually displaying the art for
the people in Texas,'' Brettell said.
   The pieces will be moved from rural Whitewright, about 60 miles
north of Dallas, to the downtown museum within a week, he said.
   The Lutheran Stiftskirche-Domgemeinde church of Quedlinburg
claims that Joe T. Meador stole the trove while his U.S. Army unit
was guarding a mine shaft where the items had been hidden.
   Attorneys for Jack Meador and Jane Meador Cook, the brother and
sister of the soldier, have been negotiating with the church to
have the treasures kept in a neutral place while they haggle over
ownership.
   Meador, who died in 1980, bequeathed the artwork to his
siblings. The heirs claim to have several, but not all, of the 14
treasures sought by the church. The treasures include a 9th- or
10th-century wood reliquary, a container; a jeweled ivory-and-gold
comb; a Byzantine rock crystal flask; four small reliquaries in the
form of turrets, and a small heart-shaped reliquary.
   Two jeweled medieval manuscripts believed held by the Meadors
for several years were sold recently on the European art market.
   Brettell said he did not know how many objects the museum would
receive. He said they included gold, silver, ivory and crystal
articles from the 8th to 14th centuries.
   ``The Quedlinburg treasury is undoubtedly the most important
Carolingian treasury of the Germanies,'' he said. ``The objects
were made for important kings. They were in a repository which was
among the three or four greatest medieval repositories.''
   The Carolingian period refers to the reign of emperor
Charlemagne and his successors in the 8th through early 10th
centuries.
   Brettel refused to assign a value to the treasures.
   ``Important Carolingian objects have not traded hands on the
open market for the last generation and therefore it's impossible
to give a real and correct evaluation,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk held
an urgent meeting Thursday with black leader Nelson Mandela in an
apparent bid to persuade him that Communists within the African
National Congress have been plotting a coup.
   De Klerk summoned Mandela to Pretoria for talks a day after the
arrest of senior ANC official Mac Maharaj, who is also a senior
member of the Communist Party.
   Dozens of other ANC members have been reported detained in
recent weeks.
   Thursday's meeting in Pretoria lasted two hours, government TV
reported.
   A statement by de Klerk, read by his spokesman, said the two
would meet again next week, at Mandela's request. No date or
location was given.
   Mandela left the meeting without making a statement.
   Police have been quoted as saying they believed some Communists
in the ANC were conspiring to overthrow the white-minority
government if its power-sharing talks with the ANC fail.
   Newspaper reports, citing unidentified sources, have suggested
the top ANC leadership did not know about the alleged plot.
   ``It appears ... the ANC does not appreciate the seriousness of
the facts which were brought to light by the South African police
investigations of the past few days,'' de Klerk's office said in a
statement announcing the meeting with Mandela, the deputy ANC
president.
   At a news conference Wednesday, Mandela denied there was any
secret plot, and said there was no rift between Communists and the
rest of the ANC leadership.
   Like Maharaj, many members of the ANC's 35-member National
Executive Committee are also members of the South African Communist
Party.
   Maharaj was detained by police Wednesday night under the
Internal Security Act. The act allows police to hold detainees
indefinitely in solitary confinement, without access to lawyers,
and to interrogate suspects until they provide ``satisfactory
answers.''
   Maharaj is one of scores of high-ranking ANC officials who have
returned home from exile since May under a presidential promise of
indemnity from arrest for past acts.
   A Communist Party spokesman, Jeremy Cronin, said Maharaj was
arrested because the government wanted to derail plans for a rally
he was organizing.
   The gathering, to be held Sunday in Soweto township outside
Johannesburg, is to mark the Communist Party's emergence as a legal
group after years as an underground movement. The party was
legalized in February.
   A police captain, Peet Bothma, was quoted as saying the rally
plans had nothing to do with the arrests.
   Bothma told government-run Radio South Africa that the arrests
of Maharaj and about 40 other ANC members detained recently ``had
resulted from information about an alleged conspiracy by the
(Communist Party) and the ANC's military wing to overthrow the
government by force if negotiations with the government failed.''
   The government has said little about the arrests, except to warn
all political groups not to try to seize power. The police
commissioner, Gen. Johan van der Merwe, said on national television
Thursday that the detentions were ``based on reliable evidence and
rest on firm legal grounds.'' He refused to provide details.
   Mandela has repeatedly rejected suggestions from government
officials and other South African political leaders that the ANC
should disassociate itself from the Communist Party, its longtime
ally.
   South African newspapers, quoting unidentified government
sources, have said the ANC's top leadership and the commanders of
the ANC military wing did not know about the alleged plot. They
said it involved weapons stockpiling and training of guerrillas.
   Mandela denied those allegations Wednesday, but noted that the
ANC is still conducting an armed struggle in South Africa. However,
he said the ANC leadership had decided to suspend its military
operations if the government agrees to remove certain obstacles to
formal negotiations on a new constitution.
   The ANC planned to go ahead with talks with the government
scheduled for Aug. 6, Mandela said.
   ANC leaders once postponed talks with the government because of
police actions, but now say they do not want anything to interfere
with progress toward a new constitution giving the black majority a
vote in national affairs.
   Chris Hani, a commander of the ANC's military wing, Spear of the
Nation, called Maharaj's arrest an ``act of provocation by the
security police to create an atmosphere that will hinder the
talks.''
   The ANC has said the existence of the Internal Security Act is
one of the obstacles to full negotiations.
   Others are procedures for the return of an estimated 20,000
exiles, the release of 3,000 people the ANC says were convicted of
political crimes, and an end to the state of emergency which gives
police extraordinary powers in the province of Natal.

   His friends surrounded Barney Frank like a
shield as the assault began, filling the seats near him and
rotating quickly into vacant spots on their mission of comfort and
protection.
   Thursday's proceedings against him started with an unusual
admonition from the chair to avoid abusive language. But the
accusations that followed were anything but gentle.
   Then, toward the end when he knew he would not be expelled,
there was Frank himself _ a subdued, somber, self-deprecating
version of himself _ apologizing and trying to explain.
   ``I have a reputation for honesty,'' he said. ``Not always tact
or tolerance, but honesty.'' The exception was what he called ``one
central element of dishonesty'' that lasted for 40 years _ the
secret that he was homosexual.
   ``Three years ago I decided that concealment didn't work. I wish
I had decided that a few years earlier,'' the Massachusetts
Democrat said.
   Frank avoided not only expulsion but censure, which would have
stripped him of his seniority, and ended up with a reprimand in
connection with favors he did for Steven Gobie, a male prostitute.
   The vote was overwhelming _ but it came after a vitriolic debate
in which angry members shouted directly at each other and Frank was
held up as an example of the decline of American values.
   ``Are there standards in our society that we will affirm for
ourselves and our children?'' demanded Rep. William Dannemeyer, the
California Republican who tried to get Frank expelled.
   ``What will we accept next?'' asked Rep. Clyde Holloway, R-La.
   A high school principal, a broadcaster, a university president,
a business leader _ all would be fired or ruined in a case like
this one _ ``Finis. Finished. Done,'' shouted Rep. Bob Dornan,
R-Calif. ``Out the door, Barney.''
   ``Garbage,'' responded Rep. Julian Dixon, the California
Democrat who heads the ethics panel that recommended a reprimand.
   He called Dannemeyer and his presentation mean, selective,
unfair. He reproached him like a naughty schoolchild. ``Follow
along, Mr. Dannemeyer, on page 49 of the report. ... Look at it,
Mr. Dannemeyer, it's on page 49. Page 49, Mr. Dannemeyer, take a
look at it!'' the normally mild-mannered Dixon said sharply.
   Frank is regarded as an able and articulate legislator, and many
colleagues approached him to shake hands or pat him on the
shoulder. But few rose to defend him during the debate.
   One who did, Rep. Tom Foglietta, D-Pa., called him a friend and
``a voice for a better world.'' And Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif.,
reminded his colleagues that ``we're real people here, not
demigods. We have all the foibles of the people who elected us.''
   It was the second day of high emotion on Capitol Hill, where the
Senate voted 96-0 Wednesday to denounce Republican Sen. Dave
Durenberger of Minnesota for financial misconduct.
   Like Durenberger before him, a repentant Frank said he had
reformed _ mostly as a result of his decision to go public about
his sexuality. ``Everything I did that was deceptive was done to
conceal the fact that I was gay,'' he said.
   ``I think I'm a better judge of character now,'' Frank said
later at a press briefing. ``I had a sufficiently low view of my
capacities in my private life so that I was more prone to do dumb
things. ... There's still a disparity between my private and public
estimates of myself, but the gap has closed.''
   Those painful truths were about as much as Frank would reveal.
   A reporter said he was curious about Frank's emotions during the
Dannemeyer presentation.
   ``And you will remain so,'' the congressman said tersely,
bouncing back to his normal feistiness.

   The Soviet Union, hard-pressed for convertible
currency with which to buy Western goods and technology, appears to
be selling off some of its vast wealth of raw materials.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Thursday his country does
not intend to take aid ``free of charge,'' but his prime minister
has acknowledged the Soviet Union is in ``a most difficult
hard-currency situation.''
   The Soviet ruble is not traded on world money markets, making it
difficult for the country to obtain Western products that are much
in demand at home, where consumer goods are scarce and generally of
poor quality.
   Recent Kremlin decisions indicate the government is digging into
its stores of raw materials for sale abroad or redirecting them for
domestic use, as well as getting ready to cut back on its foreign
aid to allies.
   Although the West German government has guaranteed $3.1 billion
in bank loans to Moscow, European Community leaders refused to
endorse an immediate $15 billion aid program. At their Houston
meeting, the leaders of the world's seven largest capitalist
countries this month refused to endorse a comprehensive aid program.
   Gorbachev said Thursday after meeting with Italian Premier
Guilio Andreotti that the Soviet Union is not seeking a ``handout''
from the West. He told the Communist Party congress earlier this
month that as far as such aid is concerned, ``We act not as beggars
but as partners and we are not going to take anything free of
charge.''
   Yet the Soviet Union clearly needs immediate cash infusions to
avoid further economic decline.
   ``We are at present in the most difficult hard-currency
situation,'' Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov said in a speech last
week as he outlined a new plan to rescue the economy.
   On Wednesday, the Soviets took a major step to get more hard
currency. De Beers Centenary AG signed an exclusive deal with
Moscow to sell the Soviet Union's rough diamond output.
   De Beers said it has agreed to make a secured advance of $1
billion to the Soviet Union immediately, against future diamond
deliveries. Repayment would be made over five years beginning in
November, it said.
   The Soviet Union has refused to deal directly with the South
African company because of apartheid, but now apparently has
changed its mind.
   Foreign experts say the Soviet Union mines 10 million to 14
million carats of diamonds a year and is the second-largest
producer after South Africa.
   In another move to soak up a domestic supply of hard currency,
the government on Tuesday announced it was setting up a network of
stores where Soviet enterprises and organizations, as well as
individual citizens, will be able to buy imported and high-quality
domestic goods for foreign currency.
   It als said Soviet citizens to spend their foreign cash in the
Soviet Union beginning Aug. 1 without having to disclose where they
got the money.
   Deputy Prime Minister Stepan Sitarian, head of the government's
economic commission, said individual Soviets had 200 million rubles
($324 million) in foreign currency they had legally acquired but
were unable to spend in the Soviet Union, except at a few special
shops for foreigners that have a limited amount of goods.
   Moscow also is changing its policies regarding raw materials for
fellow socialist countries.
   Earlier this month, Ryzhkov announced that domestic needs,
especially for the upcoming harvest, were forcing the Soviet Union
_ the world's largest oil producer _ to cut its oil exports by
140,000 barrels a day not only to Western countries but to
socialist bloc nations.
   Deliveries of bargain-rate Soviet oil supplies to Cuba,
averaging about 90 million barrels annually, already are being
reduced.
   A Gorbachev decree made earlier this week warned developing
countries _ presumably including Cuba _ that the Soviet Union was
reassessing its aid programs.
   Soviet aid to developing countries in 1989 was put at 12 billion
rubles ($19 billion), or 1.4 percent of the gross national product,
according to the labor daily Trud. Military aid is not included,
and Western estimates are much higher.
   V. Demchuk, head of the Socialist Countries Department of the
State Foreign Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers, said
in an interview published Thursday in the government newspaper
Izvestia that the Kremlin would be looking at getting a better
return on its foreign investments.
   ``A lot of money has been wasted on costly projects that had not
been well-considered,'' Demchuk said.
   He referred specifically to a plant in Vietnam that was designed
to produce 15,000 diesel engines yet only built 500. Soviet
officials say that Moscow gave Vietnam about 10 billion rubles
($16.2 billion) in credits for trade and technical asssistance from
1986-90.
   Indicating Vietnam, Cuba and Mongolia, Demchuk said he thought
it was ``reasonable to continue aid in building facilities to
increase the export capabilities of each of those countries.''

<TEXT>
   The presidents of Czechoslovakia and
West Germany met Thursday with Kurt Waldheim in a break with the
international diplomatic isolation imposed on the Austrian leader
because of his wartime past.
   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel indirectly criticized
Waldheim, warning of the dangers of lying about the past. But a
defiant Waldheim said afterward: ``I didn't lie about anything.''
   Before Havel and President Richard von Weizsaecker of West
Germany shook hands with Waldheim in a foyer of the Salzburg
Festival Hall, American Jewish activists shouted: ``Shame for
meeting Nazi Waldheim!''
   Havel and Weizsaecker attended the opening ceremony of the
annual Salzburg festival of music and drama at the invitation of
the provincial governor. At the ceremony, Havel and Weizsaecker
chatted with Waldheim, the former U.N. secretary general, and then
attended a lunch with him.
   Both leaders repeatedly emphasized the visits were private, not
official. Waldheim, elected to a six-year term as president in
1986, has acknowledged he concealed his World War II service as a
junior officer in a German army intelligence unit that has been
linked to atrocities in the Balkans. But he denied membership in,
or sympathy with, the Nazi Party.
   Weizsaecker has become one of Europe's most respected figures
for his frank reminders to Germans about the Nazi era and his
conciliatory visits to Israel and countries ravaged by Hitler's
aggression.
   As the keynote speaker of the festival opening ceremony, Havel,
without mentioning Waldheim by name, said there is ``no full
freedom where full truth is not given free passage.''
   ``Falsifiers of history do not rescue freedom, but threaten
it,'' Havel told his audience, in comments translated into German
from Czech by festival officials and then into English by The
Associated Press.
   Havel received a standing ovation after the speech. Waldheim and
other Austrian officials were given only sparse applause.
   After the ceremony, Waldheim was asked if he felt Havel's
remarks referred to him.
   ``Certainly not,'' he told Austrian state television. ``I didn't
lie about anything.''
   Official biographies released when Waldheim was the U.N. leader
and early in his presidential campaign failed to mention his
wartime years in Yugoslavia and Greece, where his German army unit
was implicated in war crimes.
   Waldheim also initially denied visits to a riding club run by
the Gestapo, the Nazi secret police, until reports of those
activities were published.
   Rabbi Avi Weiss of New York and his companions staged the noisy
protest at the festival auditorium. They were quickly subdued by
security agents, then charged with creating a public nuisance and
released. They face fines if found guilty.
   ``I am outraged by this meeting for sheer political expediency
and economic considerations,'' Weiss told reporters earlier.
   During the lunch after the ceremony, Weiss protested outside the
restaurant with another activist. Dressed in concentration camp
uniforms, they carried a banner saying, ``Waldheim resign!''
   The Austrian president's office had hoped that the visits of
Havel and Weizsaecker would be interpreted as endorsement of
Waldheim, who has been shunned by nearly all Western heads of state.
   But a decision by Havel and Weizsaecker to cut short their stays
seemed to dampen Austrian expectations.
   Salzburg government sources said a walk about town by the
presidents was also canceled, officially for security reasons.
   The first and only official visit to Austria by a Western head
of state since Waldheim's election came three weeks ago when
Cypriot President Georgios Vassiliou met with Waldheim.
   Waldheim's wartime activities have been the subject of intense
scrutiny since the revelations about his past.
   An international commission of historians in 1987 did not
confirm allegations that Waldheim was personally guilty of war
crimes but stated that he was ``in close proximity'' to wartime
atrocities.
   Waldheim has persistently denied any wrongdoing.

<HEAD>Officers Disciplined For Roles in Beatings of Black Ministers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One officer will be fired and another
suspended because of separate beatings of two black ministers, the
chief announced. He said no officer may mete out justice with
nightsticks and shotgun butts.
   Chief Steven Bishop said Wednesday he will fire a 28-year-old
officer with one year's experience for beating Rev. Joseph Okoye
after a June 4 traffic stop.
   Okoye, a native of Nigeria, said the beating that left him
bloody was racially motivated. He was disssatisfied with the
dismissal of just one of several white officers who were at the
scene.
   ``All of them have to go,'' he said. ``I don't think it's enough
to just fire the first guy.''
   Police pulled Okoye over on suspicion of drunken driving. They
said he smelled of alcohol, although he denied he had been drinking.
   Okoye, a Roman Catholic in the Kansas City, Kan., archdiocese,
has claimed police misinterpreted his strong foreign accent as
slurring his words. He said he asked why he was under arrest when
police told him to lie down and put his hands behind his back.
   Police said he was waving his arms and pushing officers.
   The officer who stopped Okoye shattered his nightstick on
Okoye's head, then grabbed another nightstick to hit him again.
   Okoye did not tell officers he was a minister during the
confrontation.
   In the other case, the police chief said, a 35-year-old,
three-year police veteran will be suspended for six months without
pay for hitting the Rev. William Fountaine, a Baptist minister, in
the head with a shotgun May 15.
   Fountaine was struck once as he lay on the ground. Police had
stopped him and ordered him and a boy out of the car. Police said
the juvenile matched the description of an armed robbery suspect
but was not charged.
   The officer hit Fountaine because he didn't lie completely face
down as ordered. He said he lifted his head to keep rain out of his
face.
   Though Fountaine never contended he was assaulted because of
racial motives, black community leaders expressed concern about the
beating.
   Maj. James Reynolds, executive officer to the chief, said
whether the minister lifted his head in defiance didn't matter.
   ``Using a shotgun to strike someone is unacceptable,'' Reynolds
said.
   The chief said: ``We must not allow the police department to
slip back into the mentality of the 1960s, when police officers
meted out justice with oak nightsticks and the butt of shotguns. We
won't allow those dinosaurs to re-emerge on this department.''

<HEAD>Yeltsin Urges Efficient Harvest to Prevent Food Shortages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin appealed
Thursday to farm workers to prevent a food shortage ``catastrophe''
in the largest Soviet republic by harvesting this year's crops as
efficiently as possible.
   Yeltsin's was the latest official bid to raise farm production
in the Soviet Union. Food is rationed in many parts of the country,
and the nation every year must import U.S. and Canadian wheat.
   As an incentive to agricultural workers, Yeltsin said the
government would issue special ``Harvest 90'' coupons to
agricultural workers _ from farmers to tractor drivers to food
processors _ allowing them to buy consumer goods that have been in
short supply.
   Details of the coupon program will be published in the coming
days, he said.
   ``The existing food situation in our republic is critical,''
Yeltsin said in an appeal to the Russian people published on the
front-page of the Sovietskaya Rossia newspaper. ``To prevent a
catastrophe, we must improve it immediately.''
   In a separate interview, Russian Prime Minister Ivan Silayev
said if the market is not soon saturated with food and consumer
goods, ``the situation will be unpredictable.''
   ``The prices will simply skyrocket,'' he told Pravitelstvenny
Vestnik newspaper.
   Yeltsin said a good harvest was expected in nearly all parts of
the Russian Federation, the most populous of the 15 Soviet
republics.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture agrees, forecasting this
year's Soviet grain harvest will be 215 million tons, slightly
higher than last year's 211 million tons.
   ``We have to gather it carefully, preserve it and get it onto
the table of the Russian people,'' Yeltsin said.
   Yeltsin acknowledged that farmers were tired of such pleas. He
agreed they needed more fuel, workers and a better transportation
network.
   He said they should have more freedom to make independent
decisions and to sell their surplus produce to whomever they want
for whatever price they can negotiate.
   Yeltsin blamed the agricultural woes on ``the careless
experiment started on our long-suffering land.''
   Gorbachev's reforms are only beginning to change the Communist
collectivized system of land ownership and the government-owned
distribution system.
   In his remarks, Yeltsin said the bonus coupons will be issued
both for produce that is required to be sold to the state, as well
as for surplus produce sold for profit. He said the government
would create a fund of consumer goods that could be exchanged for
the coupons, but he did not say what goods would be included or
where the government would get them.
   Organizations responsible for food storage and processing also
will be eligible to encourage them to reduce harvest losses, he
said.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said 25 percent of the
country's crops are lost during harvesting and storage.
   Gorbachev tried to raise national grain production and reduce
imports last year by promising to pay farmers in foreign currency
for exceeding their quotas. Newspapers said the program failed
because most farmers didn't believe the offer was true and ignored
it.

<TEXT>
   On a momentous day for the nation's disabled,
President Bush paid special tribute on Thursday to a Tacoma, Wash.,
woman who was turned away from her hometown movie theater because
of her wheelchair.
   As he signed the Americans with Disabilities Act, Bush said the
new civil rights law will mean that theaters and other public
accommodations, including restaurants and shopping centers, will no
longer be able to shut out the handicapped.
   ``These provisions mean so much to so many. To one brave girl in
particular, they will mean the world,'' Bush said.
   ``Lisa Carl, a young Washington state woman with cerebral palsy
... now will always be admitted to her hometown theater,'' said the
president.
   ``Lisa, you might not have been welcome at your theater, but
I'll tell you, welcome to the White House. We're glad you're
here,'' he said to loud applause from the crowd of more than 3,000,
including Ms. Carl.
   The 20-year-old Tacoma woman testified before a Senate committee
about the problems she has encountered, including being turned away
from a hometown theater.
   She sued the Bijou Theater for not allowing her inside. The
theater contends that because of her disabilities, the woman has
special needs and should have been accompanied by an assistant. The
suit is still pending.

<HEAD>Soviet Media Censorship Abolished, But Censor Remains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A law that forbids state censorship of the media
takes effect next week in the Soviet Union, but the main censorship
agency won't be abolished, its director said in an interview
published Thursday.
   Chief Soviet censor Vladimir Boldyrev said the Glavlit
censorship agency will continue to check foreign publications,
audio and visual materials mailed to the Soviet Union. They will
keep looking for calls to overthrow the government or criminal
action, pornography, war propaganda, violence, and race or ethnic
superiority.
   ``We check books, video and audio materials coming from abroad
in line with international agreements and the international postal
convention,'' Boldyrev told the government newspaper Izvestia.
   The press law, debated for months before it was passed by the
Soviet legislature on June 12, takes effect Aug. 1. It states:
``The press and other mass media are free,'' and, ``Censorship of
the mass media is forbidden.''
   It also gives any Soviet citizen the right to establish a media
outlet.
   The law forbids publication of state secrets, but the penalties
are to be imposed on whoever leaked them rather than the journalist
reporting them.
   It also forbids slander and ``use of the mass media to interfere
in citizens' private lives, infrigement on their honor and
dignity.'' Pornography also remains outlawed.
   Boldyrev told Izvestia that Glavlit will offer the media three
options for self-censorship:
   _For the chief editor to assume all responsibility for what is
published or broadcast;
   _For a specially appointed member of the editorial board to do
it;
   _For the editor to enter into a contract with Glavlit, asking
the agency to review and evaluate materials. In this case, Glavlit
would assume responsibility for not revealing state secrets.
   Glavlit _ the Main Administration for Safeguarding State Secrets
in the Press _ is the principal organ of censorship in the Soviet
Union, and an agency of the Soviet Council of Ministers. It is
responsible for scrutinizing all official domestic publications,
from the press to dissertations, as well those coming in from
abroad by working with Soviet customs and post office.
   Censorship and strict control of the media was a hallmark of
Soviet rule for decades. A Soviet journalist's role was first to be
a supporter of Communist Party policies and second to be a source
of information. The limited reports of the state-run media defined
what millions of people knew about their country and the world.
   Although the new media law guarantees the right of Soviets to
found their own publications, the country's poor economy places
practical restrictions on their new-found legal rights.
   Production of paper and printing plants still are part of the
state-run economy, which cannot produce enough newsprint.
   Scores of unofficial papers have appeared in the Soviet Union,
reflecting its new thirst for politics and debate. Their publishers
must scramble to reach agreements with state-run printing houses to
supply paper.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on July 15 decreed that
Communist Party control of broadcasting outlets should end and
competing voices be allowed to establish their own radio and
television stations.
   He hinted the Supreme Soviet would take up the matter with
enabling legislation akin to the law that now allows private
individuals to start publications.

<HEAD>Heavy Rain Falls in Several States, Causes Flooding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy rain swamped parts of Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska and Minnesota
on Thursday, causing flooding that closed roads and pushed rivers
to their flood stage and beyond.
   Parts of the old highway west of Salina, Kan., were closed by
flooding, and the Smoky Hill River at Elsworth was expected to
crest about 6 feet higher than flood stage.
   There was also flooding at Tescott, Kan., along a tributary to
the Saline River.
   Overnight rainfall up to 7 inches was reported across southwest
Iowa. The heavy rain caused widespread flooding of rivers and
streams.
   Up to 9 inches of rain since Wednesday morning brought the
Nishnabotna River out of its banks. The river crested more than 4
feet higher than flood stage at Randolph, Iowa, on Thursday morning.
   The crest at Hamburg, Iowa, was 11 feet higher than flood stage,
but almost a foot less than the record flood of May 27, 1987.
   The heaviest rain reported in Iowa was 9 inches at Randolph
between 7 a.m. Wednesday and 7 a.m. Thursday.
   Thunderstorms dumped up to 4 inches of rain Thursday in
southwestern Minnesota and the Twin Cities area, prompting flash
flood warnings. Basement and road flooding was reported in Redwood
Falls.
   Heavy thunderstorms dropped more than 5 inches of rain in parts
of southeast Nebraska, bringing another round of flooding to a
state pounded by severe weather and flooding in recent months.
   Early Thursday afternoon, rainshowers and thunderstorms were
scattered from central Arkansas into northern Minnesota; from
southeastern South Dakota across northeast Kansas; from southwest
Oklahoma across the Texas Big Bend; and along the central half of
the Texas Gulf Coast.
   Such storms also hit eastern Florida and southeast Georgia,
along the central and northern coast of North carolina, central
Montana, and from western Montana into northeast Washington state.
   Meridian, Miss. reached 65 degrees and broke the city's low
temperature record for the date. The previous record was 67, set in
1988.
   Boise, Idaho, cooled to 50 degrees and tied its record low for
the date, last reached in 1981; and Ely, Nev., also tied its record
low, 40, set in 1944.
   The nation's low temperature Thursday morning was 33 degrees at
Truckee, Calif.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55
degrees at Mullan, Idaho, to 100 at Palm Springs, Calif.

<HEAD>AIDS-Infected Couple Tell Judge That Marijuana Use Helps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An AIDs-afflicted husband and wife told
a judge Thursday that they and others suffering from the disease
need to smoke marijuana to overcome symptoms and side effects of
other drugs.
   Kenneth and Barbara Jenks, who are charged with possessing and
cultivating marijuana, argued as the trial opened in state court
that they were innocent because they used the drug for medical
reasons.
   ``I've got to smoke marijuana. I've got to or I'm going to
die,'' Mrs. Jenks, 24, testified during the non-jury trial in this
Panhandle city. ``I'm going to die anyway, but I would like to have
my life a little better.''
   The couple from Panama City Beach are using the defense of
medical necessity. It has been the basis of three other court
rulings around the nation that permitted people to use marijuana.
   Those cases and two permits issued by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration have been for people who smoke marijuana to relieve
suffering from glaucoma, an eye disease, and multiple sclerosis,
expert witnesses said.
   The Jenkses would be the first to get court approval in
connection with acquired immune deficiency syndrome if Circuit
Judge Clinton Foster rules in their favor.
   Assistant State Attorney Quinton Broxton argued the couple
should be found guilty because they had failed to try a legal
alternative, that of seeking to obtain a federal permit for medical
use of marijuana.
   The couple said they have since applied for such a permit.
   Jenks, 28, said he was a hemophiliac and received AIDS through a
blood transfusion, then gave the disease to his wife, who also has
uterine cancer. The two were diagnosed with the disease in 1988.
   The couple said the marijuana alleviated loss of appetite,
vomiting and nausea caused by AIDS and by drugs they have been
taking for the disease, including AZT.
   ``When I started taking AZT, I lost all reason to eat,'' Jenks
said. ``I just couldn't eat.''
   About an hour after smoking marijuana, he said, ``I ate
everything in the house.''
   Jenks said his wife was throwing up other medications until they
began using marijuana.
   ``She would lay on the couch with a bucket beside her,'' he said.
   Mrs. Jenks said after she began using marijuana she gained back
about half the 40 pounds she had lost, and stayed out of the
hospital for a year. After their arrest March 29 she said she lost
17 pounds down to 115 pounds and had to be hospitalized.
   The couple said they grew their own marijuana because it was
difficult to obtain the illicit drug and when it was available they
couldn't afford it.
   Daniel Danzak, a University of Alabama professor who has done
research on marijuana as a medicine, testified on behalf of the
couple, as did Bob Randall, president of the Washington, D.C-based
Alliance for Cannabis Theraputics.
   Danzak said 34 studies have shown marijuana can control
potentially deadly vomiting, possibly by suppressing the functions
of a part of the brain that induces nausea.
   ``I've never heard of anyone overdosing on marijuana,'' Danzak
said.
   Randall won one of the prior court rulings on medical use of the
drug, enabling him to smoke marijuana legally to treat his
glaucoma. Randall's organization is pushing for changes in federal
regulations to allow medical marijuana use.
   He told the judge he didn't think Mrs. Jenks would still be
alive if she hadn't used marijuana.
   ``Without marijuana they didn't eat anything at all,'' Randall
said.

<HEAD>Robot Spacecraft Ready for Rendezvous with Venus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Magellan, a robot spacecraft armed with a
sophisticated radar, is ready to rendezvous with Venus and begin an
eight-month exploration and mapping of the Earth's nearest
neighbor, NASA officials said Thursday.
   The spacecraft is scheduled to complete its 804-million-mile
voyage to Venus on Aug. 10 when it fires a rocket engine to settle
into an orbit that dips to within 170 miles of the planet's surface.
   Officials said the craft would approach Venus at 24,600 miles
per hour and the rocket firing will slow Magellan to 18,400 miles
per hour, enough to put it into the planet's orbital grasp.
   After a checkout period lasting until about Sept. 1, Magellan
will use a powerful radar system to penetrate the dense clouds
above Venus and gather images for a detailed map of the baked
surface of the torrid planet.
   Tony Spear, the Magellan project manager, said at a news
conference that the only major problem experienced by the $413
million spacecraft during its long journey has been an electrical
failure in one gyroscope.
   Spear said the spacecraft needs two gyros to control its
position and is equipped with four. Loss of the one gyro, he said,
still leaves a full set of two, plus one spare.
   Magellan was carried into space by the space shuttle Atlantis
and released into Earth orbit May 4, 1989. An upper stage rocket
engine fired to send Magellan streaking out of Earth orbit toward
Venus. During its 15-month voyage, the spacecraft looped the sun,
passed Earth's orbit once and then sped toward its August meeting
with Venus.
   Spear said the plans called for Magellan to spend 243 days, the
length of one Venus day, creating a radar map of 70 percent to 90
percent of the planet's surface. If the craft continues to perform,
Spear said the mission would be extended for additional mapping
cycles until 1995.
   Magellan will circle Venus once every three hours, spending 37
minutes of each orbit bouncing radar signals off the planet's
surface. Each pass will image a swath 10,000 miles long and about
16 miles wide. The data is stored in on-board recorders.
   When the spacecraft swings toward the high part of its orbit, it
will spin, aim its antennae toward Earth and spend 115 minutes
transmitting the radar data back to NASA's deep space network.
   Later, computers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory will process
the signals into images that resemble aerial photos. Scientists
expect Magellan to detect surface details as small as 260 yards
across, about 10 times more resolution than any of the 20 or so
spacecraft that have previously explored Venus.
   Venus holds fascination for scientists because it's nearly the
same size and mass as the Earth and the two planets are thought to
have shared a similar planetary formation history.
   But the two planets differ significantly in temperature and
pressure.
   Venus has a surface temperature of about 900 degrees _ about the
temperature of a self-cleaning oven _ and its atmosphere is almost
pure carbon dioxide. Venus has no liquid water and the atmospheric
pressure is more than 90 times that of Earth.
   Though Venus is 23 million miles closer to the sun than Earth,
it is covered by acid clouds so dense that its surface is in
perpetual twilight.
   Because of the clouds, only a radar such as that carried by
Magellan, can gather the images needed to map the Venusian surface.

<HEAD>Salvador Peace Talks Advance, But Military Overhaul at Impasse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salvadoran government and guerrilla
negotiators ended a week of talks at loggerheads on an armed forces
overhaul, but hopeful a human rights accord reached Thursday will
keep up the momentum toward peace.
   The two sides reached agreement on a United Nations role to seek
greater respect for basic rights at a 20-hour session that extended
the Costa Rican meeting by a day. It was the first agreement
produced in three rounds of talks since May.
   Representatives of President Alfredo Cristiani's rightist
government and rebels of the leftist Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, or FMLN, had fretted that a third round with no
progress would badly damage the effort to end 10 years of civil
war. The war has killed about 72,000 people and displaced nearly
one-fifth of El Salvador's population of 5.3 million.
   U.N. mediator Alvaro DeSoto said the rights accord ``without
doubt helps clear the way for progress on other items of the
agenda.''
   The U.N. mission to be established under the accord will be
headed by an appointee of Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar. It will comprise ``as many agents as are necessary.''
   ``The mission will enjoy broad powers to adopt any initiative it
deems appropriate for the promotion and defense of human rights,''
said the document.
   Last May, it was agreed that overhaul of the armed forces would
lead the agenda, and the fruitless June round dealt almost
exclusively with that topic.
   Early in the Costa Rican session it became obvious that
differences on the future role of the military remained vast. The
guerrillas said that on some matters, the chasm had widened.
   International watchdog agencies, the United Nations, the
Organization of American States, and the U.S. Congress are among
organizations that have chronicled flagrant and systematic abuse of
fundamental rights on a huge scale in El Salvador during the past
decade.
   The armed forces and military-linked death squads are blamed for
the murder of up to 30,000 suspected leftists. Torture of political
detainees by security forces was routine for years, according to
such organizations.
   The United Nations said abuses continue, but that the
government's rights record had improved in recent years.
   The world body condemned rebels for assassinating eight mayors
in 1988 and for later killing other non-combatants.
   Justice Minister Oscar Santamaria, the chief government
delegate, said of Thursday's human rights agreement, ``We're
enormously satisfied. This is a very meaningful advance.''
   Guerrilla commander Schafik Handal, who leads rebel negotiators,
agreed that the document ``is an accord of great value.''
   But he cautioned that the military overhaul issue remains, and
is the key to the quest for peace.
   ``This (human rights) accord will not mean a great deal unless
we advance in the field of demilitarization of Salvadoran
society,'' he said.
   The insurgents carried out a huge three-week offensive last
November and say they are ready to launch another major push.
Handal refused to say if the progress made here reduced the
likelihood of an offensive in coming weeks, but other guerrilla
sources said chances for an imminent offensive were lessened.
   Though El Salvador has held periodic elections since 1982 and
moved to consolidate some democratic institutions, the military
retains great power.
   A joint communique said the issue would receive ``priority
consideration'' at the next round, set for Aug. 17-22 in San Jose.
   It said the U.N. human-rights monitoring mission will be free to
document and denounce rights violations; conduct unrestricted
interviews with all people; make recommendations to both the
government and guerrillas; and publish its reports, conclusions and
recommendations.
   The mission will begin work as soon as a cease-fire is agreed.
Its original mandate is for a year, subject to extension.
   Both sides say they hope to agree to a cease-fire by
mid-September.
   The main sticking point in peace talks appears to be the rebel
demand for a purge of the worst rights abusers and corrupt officers
from the high command. The government and armed forces contend a
purge would violate the ``institutionality'' of the military.

   The Cabinet of President Carlos Andres
Perez resigned en masse Thursday to allow him to choose a new set
of ministers.
   Perez asked for the resignations as a prelude to a long-expected
Cabinet shakeup, government officials confirmed.
   New ministers have already been lined up, but their names and
positions have not been released.
   However, a top government official told The Associated Press
that Perez will keep all his key ministers, who helped shape a
painful and radical program that is guiding this nation of 19
million people from a state-controlled to a free-market economy.
   This will be the third Cabinet for the 17-month-old Perez
government. The president first rearranged his Cabinet in August
1989, six months after taking office.
   He later fired his finance minister, and last Friday the
transportation and communications minister, Augusto Faria Viso,
resigned to deal with accusations that he solicited a $3.5 million
kickback from a French company in exchange for awarding it a $100
million radar equipment contract.
   There are 15 official Cabinet posts and five more that Perez has
elevated to ministerial level. At a minimum, these 20 resigned. The
presidential palace could not say immediately if other agency or
public company chiefs also resigned prior to their being replaced.
   Dissatisfied with the performance of some aides, Perez will
replace six ministers and the directors of several key government
agencies, said the government source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Among them are Perez's top information official, Pastor Heydra,
who directs publicity and the official news agency Venpres, and the
director of the government's largest television station, Channel 8,
the source said.
   Unconfirmed reports in the afternoon newspapers Thursday claimed
Perez would replace his secretariat minister _ a post akin to chief
of staff _ and his justice and agriculture ministers.
   There have been rumors of changes in the Perez Cabinet for
months.
   Two key economic ministers, Planning Minister Miguel Rodriguez
and Central Bank President Pedro Tinoco, have clashed frequently
and publicly. Speculation is that one will go. Other reports said
Interior Minister Alejandro Izaguirre would be removed and allowed
to run for secretary-general of the governing Democratic Action
Party.
   But no indication emerged Thursday that these ministers would
leave.
   The new ministers and agency directors are to be sworn in Friday
morning, Miraflores Palace officials said.

Companies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The health warnings on cigarette packs
don't protect tobacco companies from liability lawsuits by smokers,
the state Supreme Court ruled Thursday.
   The decision runs counter to several federal appeals court
rulings. Those decisions generally held that the warnings, ordered
by the government in 1966, absolved tobacco companies from
responsibility in smoker's deaths.
   Industry lawyers promised to appeal.
   Richard Daynard, a law professor at Northeastern University in
Boston and chairman of the Tobacco Products Liability Project,
called the ruling the ``most important positive development in
tobacco litigation in the last decade.''
   ``This decision represents the consensus of scholarly opinion
that these earlier decisions were wrong and it is very likely to be
upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court,'' Daynard said.
   Six of the justices concurred in the decision; one filed a
partial dissent. The New Jersey high court also said that changes
in a 1987 state product-liability law didn' rule out lawsuits filed
before the law was passed. Tobacco company officials believed the
law protected them retroactively from suits by smokers.
   The ruling will allow a 1982 lawsuit, filed by Claire Dewey of
Wyckoff, to proceed. Mrs. Dewey's husband, Wilfred Dewey, died in
1981 from lung cancer after smoking for more than 40 years.
   Dewey had smoked Camels, Tareytons and Viceroys, and his wife
filed suit against the makers of those cigarettes, RJ Reynolds
Tobacco Co., American Brands and Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,
respectively.
   ``We are unable ... to decide that as a matter of public policy,
manufacturers of cigarettes should be immunized from liability for
the harms caused by their products,'' the court opinion said.
   ``In this case, a New Jersey jury could decide that a cigarette
manufacturer, rather than an injured party, ought to bear the cost
of injuries that could have been prevented with a more detailed
warning label than that required under the cigarette act,'' the
opinion said.
   Jim Fyock, a spokesman for RJ Reynolds, said the ruling ``flies
in the face of decisions in the Supreme Court of Minnesota and five
federal courts of appeal as well as numerous rulings in state and
federal trial courts.''
   Those rulings had all held that the warning labels on
cigarettes, and wide publicity about the health dangers of smoking,
meant smokers were doing so at their own risk.
   Martin London, attorney for Brown &amp; Williamson, described the
ruling as ``aberrant and wrong. Five federal appellate courts have
looked at the federal statute and have said that it preempts
warning claims.''
   Marc Edell, an attorney representing Mrs. Dewey, said it was the
first time either a federal appeals court or a state Supreme Court
held that the 1966 federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act
does not protect tobacco companies from lawsuits brought since then.
   Edell, who is handling six smoker death cases pending in New
Jersey, said the ruling would reinstate his cases.
   The court said juries should be allowed to decide whether
tobacco companies are to be held liable for the damages their
products may cause.
   ``It opens up a whole new horizon for us,'' Edell said. ``It
gives us back the full arsenal of the theories of liability that we
had when we started.''
   Edell also represented Antonio Cipollone, who sued three tobacco
companies on behalf of his wife Rose, who died of lung cancer in
1984. In June 1988, a federal jury awarded Cipollone $400,000 for
his wife's death, the first such damage award required to be paid
by a cigarette company.
   But an appeals court overturned the award this year and ordered
a new trial. Cipollone died before the appellate decision, and it
is unclear if the case will go back to court.
   Massachusetts' highest court Wednesday threw out parts of a
liability lawsuit against Philip Morris Cos. Inc.
   That court dismissed claims that the company should be held
liable because convenience stores sold cigarettes to two minors.
But the court said the youths could pursue their claims that the
company engaged in a deceptive act.

   Supreme Court nominee David Souter brushed
aside questions Thursday about a letter he wrote nearly a decade
ago opposing legislation that would have forced judges to make
decisions on abortions for teenagers.
   Souter, making a round of courtesy calls in the Senate, told
reporters he would disclose what is ``constitutionally
appropriate'' at his confirmation hearings.
   Meanwhile, one of the justices he will join if confirmed,
Thurgood Marshall, said he'd never heard of Souter before he was
selected and suggested the nomination was a political move.
   Marshall, in a dwindling liberal minority on the court with the
retirement of Justice William J. Brennan, said he didn't think
President Bush had ``ever stopped'' running for president and
``this last appointment is the epitome of what he's been doing.''
   Marshall commented in an interview Thursday night on ABC-TV's
``Primetime Live.''
   Abortion-rights advocates said they found no encouragement in
Souter's letter, although it supported their position against a
restrictive abortion bill that was before the New Hampshire
Legislature in 1981.
   Still, the letter provided a rare glimpse at Souter's judicial
actions on abortion and triggered new attempts to analyze how he
would change the Supreme Court's precarious balance on the
emotional issue that has taken center stage in the debate over his
confirmation.
   The National Right to Life Committee, the leading anti-abortion
group, said it concluded the letter ``reveals nothing'' about
Souter's views on abortion or its legality.
   President Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said of the
letter, ``We have no reaction to it one way or the other.''
   After meeting with Souter, Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., went to
the White House to give Bush a progress report on how the
nomination was going over on Capitol Hill.
   Fitzwater quoted Thurmond as saying, ``I'm impresed with him''
and ``I think he'll be just fine.'' Thurmond reported no one has
indicated they want to fight the nomination, Fitzwater said.
   Souter dismissed questions about his views on abortion and other
issues as he continued meeting with members of the Senate, which
will decide the fate of his nomination.
   ``I think you should save any issue of that sort ... for the
confirmation hearing, where I'm sure that issue will be
addressed,'' he told reporters.
   Souter met privately for an hour with the chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., who will preside
over the hearings, which are expected to begin in September. He
then met with other senators.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said the judge had told him he had
insisted that his views on the 1973 Roe vs. Wade
abortion-legalizing decision not be asked if Bush were to nominate
him.
   ``When he was invited to come down, he posed a requirement that
there not be a question which he would be asked'' on that subject,
said Specter after meeting with Souter.
   ``I look forward to making my positions clear to the extent it
is constitutionally appropriate'' when the hearings begin, Souter
told reporters.
   Souter's letter, made available by the National Abortion Rights
Action League, was written while he was a New Hampshire state
superior court judge and was dated May 13, 1981.
   He addressed it to the chairman of a state House committee and
said he was directed by the full court to state its position on a
bill that would have provided for judges to rule on whether
unmarried minor pregnant women may have abortions in cases where
they do not have a parent's consent.
   He did not state a position on the bill's basic requirement for
parental consent but voiced opposition to the so-called judicial
bypass option when there is no parental consent.
   Souter wrote that the requirement would ``leave it to individual
justices of this court to make fundamental moral decisions ...
without any standards to guide the individual judges.''
   State Superior Court Chief Justice Richard Dunfey said he
instructed Souter to write the letter because Souter was chairman
of the court's legislative committee.
   ``My recollection is that discussion on abortion itself never
included right or wrong,'' Dunfey said.
   New Hampshire abortion-rights activist Peg Dobbie said Souter's
letter was critical to successful efforts to kill the legislation.
Similar letters signed by other judges were used to oppose later
bills.
   Kate Michelman, director of the National Abortion Rights Action
League, said the letter was reason for the Senate to probe Souter's
views on constitutional issues surrounding abortion but did not
reveal his inclinations on the central abortion issue.
   ``No one wants to find a silver lining in this nomination more
than we do, but this letter does not provide it,'' she said.
   Dawn Johnsen, the group's legal director, said the letter
``suggests that Judge Souter might vote with conservatives on the
court to allow a law that mandated parental consent without any
escape valve for teen-agers who are victims of child abuse and
family violence,'' and are unable to discuss an abortion with their
parents.
   ``I don't see much reason for encouragement,'' Johnsen said.
``At best it's neutral. It's a complicated letter on just the
judicial bypass.''
   At the time of Souter's letter, the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled
that states could require a parent's consent for a minor to obtain
an abortion so long as the state provided an alternative route,
such as a judge's approval. The court in June of this year ruled in
a pair of cases that a state may require notice to both parents as
long as judicial bypass is an option.
   Melanne Verveer, executive vice president of the liberal People
for the American Way, said the letter seemed to support Bush's
depiction of Souter as a judge not inclined to judicial activism.
   She pointed to a section of the letter in which Souter said the
courts have been criticized for ``the imposition of individual
judges' views in the guise of applying constitutional terms of
great generality.'' He added that the provision of the bill he was
opposing ``would force the Superior Court to engage in just such
acts of unfettered personal choice.''
   ``It is of concern,'' Verveer said.

<HEAD>Student's Accidental Death Prompts Criticism of Stringent Methods</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three weeks after a teacher was blamed for the
accidental death of a 15-year-old student, Japanese authorities on
Thursday decided to fire the teacher and discipline five other
educators.
   The case raised a storm of criticism about the strict rules that
most schools in Japan impose on their students and the rigorous
enforcement that sometimes includes corporal punishment.
   Support for harsh disciplinary measures is widespread among
teachers, according to government polls. Parents and students
generally do not complain about the rules or their enforcement _
until tragedies strike.
   On July 6, teacher Toshihiko Hosoi, 39, closed the front gate of
a senior high school in Kobe promptly at 8:30 a.m. in line with
school policy of starting classes on time.
   Ryoko Ishida, the student, was caught in the heavy metal gate
and died a few hours later of a crushed skull, published accounts
said.
   On Thursday, the Hyogo prefectural education board in western
Japan decided to fire Hosoi for failing to take adequate safety
measures. Police are questioning him.
   The Takatsuka Senior High School principal, Atsuo Nomura, was
given a warning and his resignation was accepted at the meeting of
the education board.
   The board also cautioned the school's head teacher and the local
superintendent of education, Ryoji Shimizu, and reprimanded two
vice superintendents of education.
   Commentator Morse Saito, writing in Mainichi Shimbun newspaper,
said the school's strict gate-closing rule was designed to give
students a way to earn recommendations for employment after
graduation.
   If students followed the on-time rule, he wrote, ``By
graduation, (teachers) could recommend most students as being
prompt even though some had low grades. This is important for
(students) seeking employment after high school. The elite don't
need it.''
   Other school rules require students to wear school uniforms even
on Sundays, bar them from riding motorcycles or visiting bookstores
or tea shops.
   Enforcing school rules includes keeping records of behavior,
such as promptness, in files not accessible to students and
parents. Files are passed on from junior high schools to high
schools.
   Discipline also often includes corporal punishment, according to
Morikatsu Imahashi, a professor at Ibaraki University and a
longtime critic of such methods.
   ``Teachers often slap, punch, kick,'' he said in an interview.
   Justice Ministry figures show that reports of corporal
punishment more than doubled between 1984 and 1988.
   Extreme punishments can draw national attention. Last September,
teachers buried two junior high school students in Fukuoka, a city
on the southern island of Kyushu, in sand up to their necks. Media
reports said the teachers suspected the students of bullying their
classmates. The case caused a nationwide sensation when it came to
light earlier this month.
   With competition so intense for higher education, students and
parents aren't inclined to protest out of fear it will be held
against them. Those who Imahashi said.
   Japan's educational system is highly competitive, and many
students are being sent to cram schools, called ``jukus,'' to
prepare for tests to get into good schools. Some children start
intensive tutoring at ages as young as 3 in order to get into the
best kindergartens and elementary schools, especially those of
respected private universities that automatically admit students
from their own preparatory schools.
   Critics say some students who are under constant pressure to
study rebel with truancy or acts of violence.
   The number of pupils refusing to go to school has quadrupled to
more than 42,000 in the past 10 years, according to a recent report
by the Prime Minister's Office.
   Police say reports of students attacking or murdering their
mothers _ often in retaliation for enforcing study discipline _ are
not uncommon.
   The report by the Prime Minister's Office placed much of the
blame for juvenile problems on the educational system.
   In their zeal for children to excel in exams that largely
determine their future chances in life, the strict school system
and surrounding social environment have produced a generation of
``immature, self-centered, unemotional youths,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Japanese Minimize Strong Gorbachev Stand on Islands Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Thursday played down the importance
of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's brusque refusal to
discuss Japan's claim to the disputed Kuril Islands.
   The issue has prevented the two countries from agreeing on a
peace treaty to end World War II officially. It is a main cause for
chilly relations even while other countries have made great strides
in improving ties with Moscow.
   Gorbachev's latest statement was the banner story in every
national Japanese newspaper because it appeared to reverse Moscow's
grudging willingness to discuss the 45-year-old argument.
   It could also indicate negative fallout from what Japan had
touted as a diplomatic victory at the Houston summit of the seven
major industrial democracies this month. Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu was able to persuade other countries to mention the Kurils
dispute in a summit communique.
   Kaifu also rejected Japanese participation in a Western European
drive to give financial aid to Moscow, saying the territorial
dispute stood in the way.
   The Soviet leader met in Moscow on Wednesday with a delegation
led by Yoshio Sakurauchi, speaker of the powerful lower house of
Parliament. Gorbachev turned aside the politician's effort to raise
Tokyo's claim to be the rightful owner of Soviet-held islands off
the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido.
   Gorbachev, quoted by the official Tass news agency, said the
issue had been decided after World War II and the Soviet Union
abides by postwar arrangements.
   ``I do not want to launch a discussion today on the issue that
was repeatedly discussed with representatives of Japan,'' Tass
quoted Gorbachev as saying. ``I can repeat today: We do not have a
territorial issue.''
   The Kyodo News Service said Gorbachev went on to hint he may
cancel a trip to Tokyo tentatively set for early 1991 if Japan
insists only on talking about the territorial dispute.
   Japan is banking on Gorbachev's trip to Tokyo as a chance to
make progress on the issue. Both the Foreign Ministry and chief
government spokesman Misoji Sakamoto said Thursday they believe the
trip will take place as planned.
   ``As far as the government is concerned, there is no need to be
overly affected by'' Gorbachev's comment, Sakamoto said at a news
conference.
   A Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said it appeared Gorbachev was simply stating the official Soviet
position. The official said Japan has an ``earnest intention'' to
improve relations with the Soviet Union but stressed the most
important problem is the territorial issue.
   Soviet troops captured the islands in the last days of World War
II and claims them as historically Russian territory. Japan demands
their return on grounds that they had been ceded to Japan in
19th-century agreements.
   The Kurils make up a string of three islands and a cluster of
islets lying in waters rich with salmon and other marine resources.
The islands also have strategic value as a barrier to access
between the Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Okhotsk.

<HEAD>Baker: No Agreement Yet on Afghanistan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
on Thursday sought to dampen speculation that a settlement of the
Afghan civil war is imminent, said officials traveling with him.
   He made his remarks on the flight from Washington before he
arrived in Jakarta on the first leg of a four-nation swing through
Asia.
   U.S. officials quoted Baker as telling reporters on the flight
that the United States had not yet reached agreement with the
Soviet Union on Afghanistan.
   ``There's no agreement on Afghanistan. It's a product of the
rumor mill,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Prior to Baker's departure, U.S. officials had indicated the
secretary of state would try to clear the remaining roadblocks to a
cease-fire in Afghanistan during the trip.
   They said Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, who are to meet Aug. 1 meeting in Irkutsk, Soviet
Siberia, would discuss a timetable for Afghanistan's President
Najibullah to step down.
   ``The Soviets hinted at a deal; they haven't fleshed it out,''
said an administration official Tuesday on condition of anonymity.
``The thread of the deal is going to be pursued in Irkutsk by
Baker.''
   ABC News had said earlier this week that Shevardnadze and Baker
already had made a deal to end the Afghan civil war, but the
administration official disputed that report.
   The Bush administration has been hoping for a breakthrough to
end the war between Afghan government forces armed by the Soviet
Union and a guerrilla coalition fighting with American-supplied
weapons funneled through Pakistan.
   The Soviets have not yet told the United States how Najibullah
might be removed from power in Kabul, said the administration
official.
   The Soviet Union installed the Najibullah government in 1979,
but the government in Kabul has been unable to impose its will on
the countryside. The Soviets withdrew their troops last year but
continue to supply arms.
   In Indonesia, Baker will attend a meeting of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations on Friday and Saturday.
   ASEAN said in a statement Wednesday that a change in Cambodia's
representation in the United Nations would hurt the search for
peace in Indochina. Last week, the United States withdrew its
recognition of the guerrilla coalition that holds Cambodia's U.N.
General Assembly seat.
   Baker was quoted as telling reporters on the plane that the
change of U.S. policy on Cambodia was ``an example of our need to
adjust to new circumstances.''
   Washington also announced last week it would open talks with
Vietnam on a settlement in Cambodia and would no longer support the
right of the guerrilla coalition to represent Phnom Penh in the
world body.
   Those steps could open the way to a broader rapprochement
between the United States and Hanoi, shifting the balance of power
in Southeast Asia. Hanoi supports the Cambodian govenment.
   U.S. officials said the policy shift was designed to prevent the
Khmer Rouge, the strongest of the three guerrilla groups, from
gaining power in Cambodia. The Communist Khmer Rouge took power in
1975 and slaughtered hundreds of thousands of civilians before
being ousted by Vietnam in 1978.
   Later in the Asian trip, Baker will hold talks in Singapore and
visit Outer Mongolia.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration adopted a
rule Thursday designed to ground pilots who violate drunken driving
laws or are convicted of traffic offenses involving drugs.
   ``This kind of behavior indicates an attitude that we believe is
not compatible with safe flying,'' said FAA Administrator James B.
Busey.
   Individuals applying for an FAA-required medical certificate
must consent to the release of information from the National Driver
Register to enable the FAA to obtain and review motor vehicle
offense information.
   Pilots also would be required to provide written notification to
the FAA on each alcohol or drug-related driving conviction or
administrative action within 60 days after it occurred.
   The FAA could deny an application for a pilot certificate or
take action to suspend or revoke an existing certificate if the
pilot received two or more alcohol or drug-related convictions or
administrative actions within three years after the effective date
of the rule.
   The Air Line Pilots Association called the rule a ``witch hunt''
and said: ``The existence of alcohol-related driving convictions
does not correlate to flying a commercial airliner while
intoxicated. A federal district court upheld this principle when it
ruled that there was no basis for drawing a similar connection for
commercial truck drivers.''
   The union said in a statement it would help any pilot who
``falls victim to the FAA's oppressive and invasive ruling.''

<TEXT>
   Jules Waldman, founder of Venezuela's
English-language newspaper, has died of stroke one month after an
armed gang bound him up and robbed his Caracas home. He was 77.
   Waldman was a New York City native and former correspondent for
The New York Times who founded The Daily Journal in Caracas in
1945. He died Wednesday night, the paper reported on its front page
Thursday.
   Waldman was buried Thursday afternoon in Caracas' Cementerio del
Este.
   Waldman, a prominent member of Venezuela's American community,
was hospitalized for shock on June 30 when a gang of thieves broke
into his home in a Caracas suburb, tied him up at gunpoint and made
off with the family valuables.
   Waldman contracted pneumonia but seemed on his way to recovery
when he had the stroke, the Daily Journal reported.
   The Caracas Journal, founded as a weekly to be ``a link between
the English-language (expatriate) community and Venezuela,'' grew
into a 15,000 daily circulation newspaper. It served as a training
ground for many young American journalists who later became foreign
correspondents.
   Born Dec. 14, 1912, into a middle-class Queens family, Waldman
graduated from Columbia University and spent the Depression years
in various jobs. He first worked in journalism as a part-time,
$10-per-week feature writer at the now-defunct Long Island Daily
Press.
   He tripled his salary by becoming an ad man at B. Altman &amp; Co.
Influenced by a collegue who had left New York for Venezuela,
Waldman took a leave of absence in 1940 and sailed for Caracas. The
city became his adopted home.
   Waldman had convinced B. Altman to make him their Venezuela
representative, and accompanying him on the ship were six Steinway
pianos. He and a collegue set up Venezuela's first music store.
   But Waldman enjoyed reporting, and nights after closing the shop
he wrote articles for Harpers magazine and the New Republic.
Sidelined during World War II for medical reasons, he helped set up
the Venezuelan-American Center, the focus of Caracas'
English-language community.
   He also dreamed of starting a newspaper.
   ``I felt it could inform, entertain and enlighten both
foreigners and bilingual Venezuelans, of whom there were many,''
the Daily Journal quoted Waldman as saying in 1985.
   Waldman, among other stories, chronicled the overthrow of
Venezuela's last dictatorship on Jan. 23, 1958, the day strongman
Marcos Perez Jimenez fled the country.
   Waldman recalled standing on the roof of his house on a hill
when he saw a DC-4 take off from the private La Carlota airport
below. ``We knew it was carrying the ex-president, a few of his
friends, and his wife to Santa Domingo,'' he was quoted as saying.
   He rushed to the newspaper, called in the rest of the Daily
Journal staff and by 5 a.m. a bilingual special edition was on the
street _ hours before the other Venezuelan dailies.
   Waldman wrote intermittently for The New York Times for about 25
years, and befriended some of Venezuela's presidents. He received
Venezuela's National Journalism Award, and many presidential
decorations.
   He is survived by his wife, the former Agnes Dolnay, two
children, Catherine and Kenneth, and four grandchildren.

<HEAD>Archaeologists Discover Hundreds of Graves In Path of Highway
Project</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROD RICHARDSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A project to broaden a freeway running through the
heart of town has uncovered a forgotten layer of Dallas history _
hundreds of unmarked graves belonging to generations of former
slaves and black settlers.
   Clearing a path for the expansion of the North Central
Expressway earlier this year, a backhoe scraped across portions of
caskets, wooden markers and gravestones. Archaeologists were
brought in to relocate some of the graves, an excavation that was
supposed to take a few weeks to complete.
   That was three months ago.
   ``That was a naive estimate I made last spring,'' said Jerry
Henderson, the archaeologist overseeing the project for the State
Highway and Transportation Department.
   As more and more graves at Freedman's Cemetery are uncovered
along the freeway _ where they've been covered for years _ some
containing fascinating relics, officials now say the dig may take
two years.
   ``It's an emotional, archaeological and historical issue,'' Ms.
Henderson said. ``You didn't do it and I didn't do it, but let's
face it: The people who were buried here were wronged. And it's up
to us to see that their final resting place is restored and their
memories preserved.''
   About 800 graves have so far been marked off with twine, and Ms.
Henderson said the final count may exceed 2,000. She said no more
than 500 graves will have to be moved to make room for the highway
expansion.
   There is little written record of the cemetery, located just
north of downtown, but Ms. Henderson said most of Dallas' blacks
apparently were buried there from 1861 to 1925.
   ``When you're looking at black history, it's very difficult to
track down because you have no paper trail to follow _ unlike white
history,'' said Steve Mabry, a local preservationist.
   Underlining this fact, Freedman's Cemetery is bordered on one
side by an equally old, but well-kept Catholic cemetery.
   More than a century ago, the area was dubbed North Dallas
Freedmentown, for the emancipated slaves who lived there, Mabry
said. Many of the community's residents worked on the nearby
railroad and others worked for well-to-do whites.
   Freedmentown was virtually wiped out in the 1940s when North
Central Expressway was built right through the middle of the
cemetery. In the 1960s, a memorial park was built over part of the
remaining cemetery.
   The relocation of the graves will be difficult because most are
bunched together in what appear to be families, Ms. Henderson said.
   ``We don't want to disrupt the internal integrity of the
organization,'' Ms. Henderson said. ``For example, we don't want to
move the mother right here and then move the baby over there.''
   The sensitivity Ms. Henderson and her crew have displayed is one
reason the excavation hasn't caused controversy. In fact, local
historians and preservationists say they're excited by the
prospects.
   ``The thing that impresses me about that project is that the
people working with it have gotten some input from the community
that has more of a relationship with that cemetery,'' said Harry
Robinson Jr., director of Museum of African American Life and
Culture.
   Funerary objects such as shells, ceramic figurines, glass vials,
marbles and a watch have been found atop some graves. Items
unearthed at the site will eventually be put on display at his
museum, Robinson said.
   Robinson plans to organize a junior archaeological camp this
summer, where children will help wash the materials found in the
graves.
   ``Of course no bodies will be bothered,'' he said. ``If they
were doing that then people would say `What's going on out there?'''

   The survivor of the 1986 plane wreck in Nicaragua
that helped unravel the Iran-Contra affair tearfully recounted the
crash as he testifed Thursday in his damage suit against a retired
general and a CIA-linked airline.
   Eugene Hasenfus, who was a cargo handler aboard planes carrying
aid to the Contras, filed a federal lawsuit along with the family
of co-pilot Wallace Sawyer Jr., who was among three killed when a
Sandinista rocket downed their plane.
   Hasenfus, his voice cracking and tears in his eyes, said he
stood in the open cargo door as his C-123 flew into southern
Nicaragua on Oct. 5, 1986, with a load of supplies for a Contra
force pinned down by Sandinistas.
   ``There was a loud explosion from the right. I was astounded.
The whole plane was on fire,'' Hasenfus said.
   ``Sawyer yelled `What happened?' It was the last thing he ever
said.''
   Wearing a skydiving parachute supplied by his brother in
Wisconsin, Hasenfus tried to jump, but initially became entangled
in a machine gun aimed out the door. Finally, he freed himself and
pulled his ripcord.
   ``I was in a state of shock,'' he said. ``I could see the
aircraft in a spin _ there was nothing but black smoke and flames.''
   Hasenfus and Sawyer's family are suing retired Air Force Maj.
Gen. Richard Secord and Miami-based Southern Air Transport,
alleging they misled the crew and negligently used aircraft without
adequate safety equipment.
   Following the crash, President Reagan denied there was any U.S.
government connection to the flight. But Hasenfus, and documents in
the wreckage of the plane, told another story, linking the crew to
U.S. officials.
   And after the disclosure the following month that proceeds from
the Reagan administration's secret arms sales to Iran had been
diverted to the Contras, congressional investigations showed that
the plane was part of White House aide Oliver North's secret Contra
resupply network. The Contras were seeking to overthrow Nicaragua's
leftist Sandinista government.
   As Hasenfus testified about the crash, his wife, Sally, and
Sawyer's widow, Kasanee, of Magnolia, Ark., watched intently, their
eyes glistening.
   Hasenfus said he evaded the Sandinistas overnight in the
rain-soaked jungle, but was captured the next day. They brought him
to the crash site, where he said the soldiers showed him a bag
containing the remains of Sawyer, pilot William Cooper, and the
mission's Contra radio man.
   ``They laughed _ they thought it was funny,'' Hasenfus said. The
Sandinistas eventually convicted Hasenfus of terrorism and
sentenced him to 30 years in prison, but released him after three
months.
   Before recounting the crash, Hasenfus, 49, now a construction
worker in Marinette, Wis., said he worked for CIA-owned Air America
during the Vietnam War.
   When Central American hostilities heated up in July 1986, he was
contacted by Cooper and brought to the Southern Air headquarters at
Miami International Airport. He signed a contract with Corporate
Air Services, but said he understood it was a front for Southern
Air, which was paying his expenses.
   He said the crews complained that there was no safety equipment
such as parachutes or survival gear, and that the navigation radios
did not work properly. But he said he accepted the defects,
thinking it was a patriotic, shoestring effort to fight communists
in Central America.
   Only when the Iran-Contra affair became public, he said, did he
become aware that Reagan aide Oliver North, Secord and Southern Air
were running the supply effort as a profit-making enterprise, even
buying a Lear jet.
   On cross-examination, Southern Air attorney Robert Beckman
focused on the role of Corporate Air Services, forcing Hasenfus to
show that his pay drafts, tax returns and even unemployment
compensation claim all reflected that company's name rather than
Southern Air.
   Beckman also sought to show Hasenfus had violated a secrecy
agreement he signed, riling the witness. Hasenfus said the case
``was already blown by Congress'' when he later sold the rights to
his story for $10,000 to CBS.
   Beckman referred to the hostilities as a ``war'' to bolster the
defense contention that Hasenfus and Sawyer had willingly accepted
the risks when they signed on.
   ``It wasn't a war, and Vietnam wasn't a war,'' Hasenfus
responded.
   Under questioning by Secord's attorney, Thomas Spencer, Hasenfus
agreed he had never met the man he was suing, nor did he have any
documents signed by Secord.
   Hasenfus also acknowledged he had received some money after the
crash.He said a brown bag containing $6,000 was given to his wife
by a man who said ``this is from the boys.''
   Secord's attorneys have said their client never had any legal
relationship with Hasenfus and Sawyer, and had never met them.
   Secord pleaded guilty on Nov. 8, 1989, to lying to congressional
investigators when he said he wasn't aware of any money that went
to North's benefit from the maze of companies he used in the
Iran-Contra affair. He was sentenced to two years' probation.

<TEXT>
   A closely guarded truck convoy
Thursday began spiriting away a vast cache of deadly nerve gas
secretly stored by the United States near this small West German
town for more than 20 years.
   West German authorities said someone phoned in a bomb threat
against the toxic convoy but that the transport of the first
shipment of nerve gas proceeded without any hitches.
   It was the beginning of the end for the United States' sole
chemical weapons' depot in Europe _ a huge arsenal of 102,000
artillery shells covertly bunkered here since the Cold War days as
a deterrent against Soviet aggression.
   Clausen residents breathed a collective sigh of relief while
watching the removal of deadly weapons whose existence they were
told about just a few months ago.
   ``I'm glad they're going,'' said Deputy Mayor Emil Cronauer,
among the citizens lining Clausen's main street to watch the U.S.
army container trucks rumble by. ``I think the same thing that's
now happening with chemical weapons is going to happen to atomic
weapons.''
   Joseph Wadle, a 72-year-old Clausen resident, echoed concerns
among many Germans about the safety of the transport. ``I'm
relieved that they're being removed. I just hope that everything
goes well,'' he said.
   German residents weren't the only ones curious about the parade
of lethal chemicals.
   Soviet observers, permitted to monitor some military operations
under agreement with the West, also watched the convoy, U.S.
military officials said.
   The lethal cargo, destined for destruction on an atoll in the
Pacific Ocean, is being removed under a 1986 U.S.-West German
agreement. The operation is costing $83 million.
   A massive security operation guarded the cargo as a convoy of
nearly 80 military vehicles left the U.S. Army depot at Clausen.
   West German police helicopters followed the convoy as it snaked
along its route and crack West German paramilitary squads stood in
fields along the highway, or manned positions on overpasses.
   Green vans filled with West German paramilitary troopers were
interspersed within the convoy. Riot helmets and shields could be
seen through the vans' rear windows.
   The first trucks arrived at Miesau, 30 miles from Clausen, about
2{ hours later. Both towns are in the southwest part of the country
_ Clausen is 15 miles south of Kaiserslautern, and Miesau is 18
miles west of Kaiserslautern.
   At Miesau, the containers are to be loaded onto special trains
that will take them to Nordenham, on the North Sea, where they will
be placed aboard U.S. Navy ships for transport to Johnston Atoll.
   The weapons will be destroyed at a later date in a specially
built incinerator on the U.S. atoll, 800 miles southwest of Hawaii.
   The chemical weapons were hauled on 20 giant U.S. Army
tractor-trailer rigs. The cargo was sealed in air-tight containers.
   Other vehicles contained decontamination crews, firefighters,
West German and American soldiers, police, monitoring teams and
medical staff.
   Only four demonstrators were spotted. They draped posters,
including one that said: ``Evil is simply being shifted from here
to the Pacific,'' over a stone wall next a church along the convoy
route in Clausen.
   West German activists were also angry that even though the
presence of U.S. chemical weapons on German soil was widely
assumed, Washington refused to acknowledge their exact location
until March.
   The West German government is paying $31 million for removal of
the chemical weapons, and the U.S. cost is $52 million.
   The artillery shells _ some 6 inches in diameter, some 8 inches
_ are loaded with liquid nerve agents, U.S. military officials
said. They were brought to Clausen between 1958 and 1968, where
they have remained ever since.
   One convoy will take the weapons daily from Clausen to Miesau
over the next 30 days. The rail transport to the North Sea port
will take about a week and will be conducted at night.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and former President Reagan
agreed in 1986 to remove the chemical weapons by 1992. President
Bush advanced the timetable.
   Lt. Gen. John Shalikashvili, deputy commander in chief of U.S.
Army-Europe, defended what he said had been a joint U.S.-German
decision to keep the weapons depot a secret. ``The safety and
security of those weapons dictated that their location remain
classified,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A federal prosecutor dropped his
obscenity case Thursday against a confiscated photograph of a nude
father and son that was described as a recognized work of art.
   ``Having completed my review of this matter, I am satisfied, to
the extent that I can be, that there is no actionable child sexual
victimization implicit in or resulting from the taking and
production of this photograph,'' U.S. Attorney Richard S. Cohen
said in a statement.
   The Maine Arts Commission called Cohen's retreat ``an extremely
strong vote for the freedom of artistic expression.''
   The government had at first sought to destroy the picture, a
1962 work by photographer Walter Chappell that has been exhibited
throughout the nation. The picture shows a naked Chappell holding
his infant son next to his erect penis.
   Cohen said Thursday the print had been returned to the attorney
of its owner, Birgit Lenderink, who lives in a Buddhist meditation
center in Barnet, Vt.
   The government's case, entitled ``United States of America vs.
One Obscene Photograph,'' drew fire from artists as well as
newspaper editorial writers, who noted that the photograph was
exhibited in many galleries and reprinted in a Harper &amp; Row book on
American nude photography.
   Cohen's statement also cited ``the ready availability of this
photograph in other parts of the country.''
   Federal officials seized the framed, black and white print this
winter at the state line in Houlton as friends were trying to bring
it to Ms. Lenderink.
   None of the people who made or possessed the picture were
charged in the case.
   Chappell, who lives in El Rito, N.M., a tiny farming community
north of Santa Fe, did not respond to messages left at his home by
The Associated Press.
   Maine Arts Commission spokesman Dick Dyer said he understood how
someone unfamiliar with Chappell's work could question the
photograph.
   ``When he (Cohen) saw the image, without any explanation
whatsoever, to his credit, he did investigate,'' said Dyer. ``We're
very pleased that he has had the wisdom to see through the process
and decide not to prosecute the photograph.''
   The case was withdrawn from U.S. District Court in Bangor.

<HEAD>Pittsburgh Man Acquires British Lordship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. man paid $169,000 on Thursday for the
ancient manorial title to a town in the heart of Shakespearean
England, the Manorial Auctioneers said. He gets the title, a bit of
pomp and ceremony, and that's it.
   Joseph Hardy of Pittsburgh receives no land or property with his
Lordship of the Manor of Henley-in-Arden, and he is not granted
seat in the House of Lords.
   But he is entitled to preside over the annual ceremonial parade
held each year in the town, 80 miles northwest of London.
   The document also confers the right to hold a weekly market and
sit at the head of the long table at the annual dinner in the
Guildhall, built in 1448.
   The quaint village is nestled in the Forest of Arden, seven
miles northwest of Stratford-upon-Avon, the birthplace of William
Shakespeare.
   Every year on the second Tuesday in November, a procession
gathers at the 13th-century market cross in Henley-in-Arden. The
ceremonial court parade proceeds to the manorial church of St. John
the Baptist and ends at the old Guildhall for a dinner attended by
local officials and other lords of the manor.
   Hardy, accompanied at the London auction by his wife and three
daughters, is expected to take an active interest in preserving the
traditions attached to his acquisition, said Robert Smith, chairman
of the Manorial Society of Great Britain, which helped arrange the
auction.
   Other titles sold at auction Thursday included the barony and
manor of Morpeth, Northumberland, which brought $99,500, and the
barony lordship of Frenchpark, County Roscommon, Ireland, for
$54,000.
   Lordships of the manor are the oldest titles in England,
predating the Norman Conquest of 1066. They once carried
considerable land rights but their significance today is largely
symbolic.

<HEAD>New Academy Launched for Science, Math Teachers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SARAH NORDGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teachers will be the students at a new school
designed to sharpen instructors' math and science skills so they
can pass those abilities to undereducated Chicago youngsters.
   ``I hope it will make the Chicago public school system the
number one system in the country, a prototype ... for other big
cities,'' Nobel laureate Leon Lederman said of the Academy for
Mathematics and Science Teachers in Chicago, which was dedicated
Thursday.
   Classes at the academy's South Side campus are to begin in as
early as September.
   Plans call for all elementary teachers and all secondary
teachers of math and science _ a total of about 17,000 public
school instructors _ to attend the academy over the next six years.
   Teachers will typically attend the academy two or three days a
week for up to 10 weeks, with the rest of the week spent at their
schools so they can try out their new skills.
   ``We have to recognize that inner cities represent a repository
of human resources not represented in math, science and the
technical areas,'' said Lederman, who won the 1988 Nobel Prize in
physics. ``The world can get along very easily without us. If we
want to be a player, we have to do something about math and
science.''
   American public school students rank 18th out of world's 20 most
industrial nations in science knowledge, officials said.
   New teachers who want to work in Chicago's 400,000-student
public school system will be asked to first spend a year at the
academy, said acting director Gordon Berry, a physicist on leave
from Argonne National Laboratory.
   ``We must reach out and bring all of America's children into
science in greater numbers than ever before if our work force is to
remain competitive in the global market,'' Secretary of Energy
James Watkins said at the ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by about
300 teachers.
   The Energy Department will provide initial funding and technical
assistance to the academy, he said.
   ``By initiating the academy in a major urban area ... we will be
able to create new education opportunities for black, Hispanic and
other students currently under-represented in science and
technology,'' Watkins said in a statement.
   Federal funding will account for $25 million of the academy's
annual $35 million operating budget, said Lederman, who helped
design the program. The rest would come from city, state and
private sources, he said.

<HEAD>Four Italian Ministers Resign in Dispute Over TV Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Christian Democrat ministers resigned from the
government Thursday night in a dispute over a proposed television
law, possibly threatening Premier Giulio Andreotti's five-party
coalition.
   The four ministers are part of a wing of the party loyal to
former premier and party leader Ciriaco De Mita, who was ousted
from his leadership role last year.
   One of the four, Education Minister Sergio Mattarella, said they
were resigning because the government was trying to force through
an amendment to the bill that would clash with European Community
regulations on TV advertising.
   Among other things, the bill would give Italian TV stations
until 1993 to limit the number of commercial interruptions of
films, while EC norms call for this to be done by 1991.
   However, political observers saw the resignations as a
continuation of an internal party struggle between De Mita and
Andreotti.
   It was not immediately clear what effect the resignations would
have on the government. But the five parties in the governing
coalition have been saying that a crisis should be avoided during
the six months beginning in July when Italy holds the rotating
presidency of the EC.
   Other than Mattarella, those resigning were State Industry
Minister Carlo Francanzani, Defense Minister Mino Martinazzoli, and
Riccardo Misasi, minister of extraordinary aid to the south.
   There are 16 Christian Democrat ministers in the 32-member
Cabinet.
   The other coalition parties are the Socialists and the tiny
Republicans, Liberals and Social Democrats.
   Andreotti's coalition, the 49th government in Italy's postwar
history, has been in office since July 22, 1989.
   The television bill is part of a long sought law to regulate the
country's public and private airwaves. Parties have been wrangling
over various versions of the bill for years.

   LOS ANGELES: split verdict.
   The 31-year-old Camarena was kidnapped off a Guadalajara street
in February 1985, a crime that strained relations between the
United States and Mexico.
   The trial was the second stemming from the murders of Camarena
and his pilot, a crime which angry U.S. authorities characterized
as a reflection of official corruption in Mexico.
   Disputes between Mexico and the United States over the case have
erupted on several occasions throughout the investigation and
trials. The DEA has vowed to capture every person involved in the
slaying. So far, 22 people have been charged in this country and
more than 20 convicted in Mexico.
   Testimony at both American trials has shown the agent was taken
to a house where he was tortured and interrogated by drug lords
before being slain along with his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar.
   Their bodies were found a month later on a ranch 65 miles
outside Guadalajara.
   The four men who stood trial together were Ruben Zuno Arce, a
Guadalajara businessman who is the brother-in-law of former Mexican
President Luis Echeverria; Juan Jose Bernabe Ramirez, a former
Mexican homicide officer and Javier Vasquez Velasco, a former
bodyguard accused of murdering two American tourists in an apparent
mistake killing.

   It was crude, even lewd. But this time fans
were spared seeing where she's tattooed.
   Still, many people said Thursday that Roseanne Barr was a
disgrace for her shrill rendition of the national anthem at a
National League baseball doubleheader and a crude on-field gesture
afterward.
   Chris Roberts, a sports reporter for KFI radio in Los Angeles,
said: ``She couldn't carry a note if she was on her way to the post
office.''
   But others said simply: Lighten up.
   They maintained the corpulent, caustic comedian who stars on the
popular ABC-TV sitcom ``Roseanne'' did the best she could or may
have become confused by the sound system's delay and resorted to
shtick.
   KFI's entertainment reporter Tracy Miller said Barr was doing a
parody of baseball players when she grabbed her crotch and spit
after singing ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' at Wednesday night's
games between the San Diego Padres and Cincinnati Reds.
   In the stands during a World Series game in Oakland last fall,
Barr bared her bottom, revealing a tattoo declaring ``Tom'' _ her
husband, Tom Arnold.
   ``They knew what kind of singer she is. She's just an average
singer. She's not an opera singer,'' Arnold told The Associated
Press Thursday from the couple's Malibu home. ``She did the best
she could.''
   Barr, who wouldn't come to the telephone, was troubled by the
criticism, he said.
   ``She's very sorry. She's very upset that people think she meant
disrespect. We weren't trying to disrespect that song at all,''
Arnold said.
   Noting the Padres won both games, Arnold added: ``I think they
should have her back every night. But we know that won't happen
with all this grief.''
   In a television interview, Arnold complained that publicity
about Barr has become ``vicious, it's just out of control. ... It's
only negative: `Is she self-destructing?'''
   ``You can't call it self-destructive when it's being done to
you,'' Barr told the interviewer from NBC News. ``That's like the
final icing on the cake, that they do it to me and then call it
self-destructive. But they do that to all women.''
   Tom Werner, who became the chairman and managing partner of the
Padres this season, also is the co-creator and executive producer
of ``Roseanne.''
   He met privately with Padres officials for 45 minutes Wednesday
night and then refused to talk to reporters directly. Repeated
messages left at his Los Angeles office went unanswered Thursday.
   Padres officials said they fielded about 1,200 calls Thursday,
most of them complaints about Barr's performance.
   The team issued an apology, saying:
   ``The Padres recognize their obligation to ensure that the
national anthem is sung with respect and dignity. ... It is
apparent we did not do our part because many fans were offended
both by the rendition and Roseanne's gestures. To those fans, we
apologize and make the commitment that in the future we will strive
to see the anthem is presented with the dignity it is due.''
   National League President Bill White said: ``We have discussed
it with the Padres and are in agreement with their apology. We are
satisfied that they will take all necessary steps to assure it will
not happen again.''
   Opera star Robert Merrill, who has sung the national anthem in
New York's Yankee Stadium for 18 years, was among those appalled by
Barr's performance.
   ``This woman, who obviously has no taste at all, went out to
sing the national anthem and distorted the song,'' he said.
   ``It was to me like burning of the flag. It was like, `Here I am
and to hell with you.' It was a complete mockery and outlandish.''
   Merrill, who also has sung the anthem for nine U.S. presidents,
added: ``She's a disgrace. Did you see what she did when she walked
off? I almost upchucked my dinner. I was ill to my stomach. I don't
know if I've ever felt that angry.
   ``It isn't good for baseball. Baseball is like apple pie,
Cracker Jacks and peanuts. It's the national pastime. This is a
national disgrace.''
   About 30,000 people attended the doubleheader at Jack Murphy
Stadium. The club promoted the twin bill as ``Working Women's
Night.''
   ``I was embarrassed for the women who showed up,'' said
spectator Jannette Davis of San Diego. ``This was supposed to be a
night of saluting those who worked hard and she made us all feel
like crap.''
   Barr, who had said last week that she wouldn't be trying for
laughs when she sang the national anthem, plugged her ears with her
hands at the start of the song, then gave a wailing rendition.
   When the boos rose, Barr grabbed herself and spit on the ground.
   Said Padres pitcher Eric Show: ``I can't believe it happened.
It's an insult. There are people who died for that song. Our
national anthem exemplifies a lot of things.''
   Barr's husband later made a ceremonial pitch, but the crowd
didn't react.
   When Barr left the field with him later, though, the boos
resumed.
   ``I think I did great and people wanted more,'' Barr told a
reporter for KFMB-TV before leaving the field.

<HEAD>Panama's Lawsuit to Accuse Noriega of Murder, Drug Trafficking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALINA GUERRERO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Panamanian lawsuit to be filed in
Miami accuses former strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega of
involvement in murder, torture and drug trafficking, according to
legal papers obtained Thursday. The government is seeking up to
$6.5 billion in damages.
   The 40-page suit, obtained from government sources by The
Associated Press, carries a laundry list of accusations with 11
specific charges, including fraud, illicit enrichment, racketeering
and offenses against the Panamanian people.
   The suit asks that Noriega and his allies repay Panama at least
$500 million in damages. It also asks for any damage award to be
tripled _ which would make for a maximum of $1.5 billion.
   In addition, the suit seeks a separate $5 billion punitive
payment.
   Panamanian officials have said they do not expect to recover
that full amount but intend it as a statement of damage done to
Panama. They said the suit will be filed within days.
   The suit outlines cases of alleged assassination, torture, drug
trafficking, money laundering, embezzlement, illegal sale of visas
and passports, and abuse of authority while Noriega headed the
defunct Panama Defense Forces.
   From that position, he controlled Panama's government until he
was ousted in December by the U.S. invasion. Noriega was brought
back to Miami, where he now faces U.S. drug-trafficking charges.
   The 1988 U.S. indictment accuses Noriega of taking $4.6 million
in bribes from Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to turn Panama into
a way station for cocaine trafficking.
   Panama's suit claims Noriega earned about $700,000 during his 28
years as a military officer but is now worth an estimated $300
million.
   The government's lawyers _ John G. Kester, Gregory B. Craig and
Kevin J. Hasson _ contend in the suit that Noriega's activities
caused Panama ``enormous material losses.'' The suit says Panama
was damaged by a loss of tourism and an American trade embargo.
   The suit names 19 co-defendants. They include Marcos Justines,
Noriega's chief of staff, who is jailed in Panama City; Carlos
Duque, the 1989 presidential candidate of Noriega's party; Michael
Harari, a former Israeli military officer; three former
ambassadors; Noriega's wife Felicidad; and his mistress Vicki Amado.
   However, it was not clear if the Panamanian government could
recover money from those co-defendants not in the United States.
   The suit claims Noriega was involved in the murder of army
officers who plotted against him.
   It also says Noriega was paid $7.95 million for letting drugs
flow through Panama and $4 million to $7 million for protecting
members of Colombia's Medellin drug cartel.
   It says that during the eight years Noriega headed the armed
forces, he sold at least eight government planes for $7 million,
which he kept. It did not name any buyer.
   The suit also claims Noriega diverted $1.2 million in government
agricultural funds to his own use.
   It claims government functionaries issued government checks for
about $96 million to pay personal debts, and that $12 million of
that amount went to Noriega.
   It also accuses Noriega of selling 2,000 illegal passports at
$50,000 each.
   Panama's attorney general, Rogelio Cruz, is to go to Washington
this week to further discuss the suit with the law firm of Williams
&amp; Connolly.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Former President Carter said
Thursday that Haiti is not ready for elections because of a climate
of fear following the return from exile of figures linked to the
Duvalier regime.
   Carter spoke after meeting Haitian leaders who are struggling to
lead this impoverished Caribbean nation toward its first free
elections.
   ``At present, the climate ... is not conducive to holding
elections,'' Carter said at a news conference. ``There's much doubt
about security and much doubt that election laws will be followed.''
   But Carter, wrapping up a two-day visit, said he thinks ``there
will be the proper climate'' months before the scheduled Nov. 4
elections.
   Carter, heading a delegation sponsored by the Washington-based
National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, met
Wednesday with provisional President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot and
Armed Forces commander Lt. Gen. Herard Abraham to discuss election
security.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot was appointed provisional president in
March after the ouster of military ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril. At
that time, there was great hope her civilian caretaker government
could lead Haiti to democracy, but she is now viewed as exercising
little control over the 6,000-member military.
   Haiti has been ruled by military force for most of its history
since winning independence from France in 1804.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot has requested the United Nations send 300
civilian and 40 military officials to monitor the vote. Carter said
he believes the United Nations will approve that request.
   Carter has recently monitored elections in Panama, Nicaragua and
the Dominican Republic.
   Carter also said he received assurances from the military they
would serve a warrant for the arrest of Roger Lafontant. Lafontant,
who returned to Haiti from exile in early July, reportedly headed
the Tonton Macoutes private militia that enforced the Duvalier
dictatorship for 29 years until Jean-Claude Duvalier was deposed in
1986.
   The return of Lafontant and other officials linked to brutal
regimes has cast doubt a free and fair vote can occur.
   The return of Williams Regala, a retired army officer believed
responsible for an election-day massacre in November 1987, has also
alarmed Haitians. In the massacre, thugs backed by soldiers shot or
hacked to death 34 voters.
   ``We've heard everywhere of the dangers of the presence of Roger
Lafontant and Williams Regala,'' said Carter.
   He said he hoped Lafontant would ``leave the country and stay
out of the country until after elections.'' He said Regala had
indicated he would return to the United States, where he has been
exiled.
   Lafontant has hired three laywers to fight a warrant and has
told the Haitian media he wants to run for president.

<HEAD>Last-Minute Provision Bars Drilling on Old Offshore Carolina Lease</HEAD>

   A provision that blocks drilling for natural
gas and oil off the mid-Atlantic coast was tacked onto compromise
oil spill legislation Thursday in a last minute maneuver that
caught the petroleum industry by surprise.
   The drilling plans by Mobil Corp, which bought rights to leases
40 miles off the coast of Cape Hatteras nearly a decade ago, have
been the focus of longstanding controversy in North Carolina.
   Mobil and several other oil companies have plans to drill the
leases in expectations of finding significant amounts of natural
gas.
   But Rep. Walter Jones, D-N.C., the chairman of a conference
committee considering the oil spill bill, won approval from his
colleagues for an amendment that would block such drilling for at
least 14 months and could cause further complications for Mobil
after that.
   The compromise bill then was approved by a voice vote. It now
will be considered by both the House and Senate for final passage.
   Jones' amdendment, approved despite opposition from oil state
congressmen, calls for no drilling by Mobil until additional
environmental studies are undertaken by a scientific panel. It
prohibits any leasing, oil drilling or exploratory activity in the
offshore areas near North Carolina, South Carolina and part of
Virginia before Oct. 1, 1991.
   Rep. Jack Fields, D-Texas, who has championed oil industry
interests, argued against the measure and said he had been notified
of Jones' plans to offer the amendment only hours before.
   ``This is a pure and simple moratorium,'' declared Rep. Ron
Marlenee, R-Mont., also in opposition. He said he expects the
provision to be challenged when the compromise oil spill bill comes
up for final approval. The Senate members of the conference
committee did not object to the measure.
   President Bush recently postponed oil lease sales along much of
the U.S. coast where there have been environmental concerns. The
mid-Atlantic lease areas, including the coastal area off North
Carolina, were not included in Bush's action.
   ``This amendment establishes a fair process,'' said Jones in
proposing his amendment as a concluding piece of business before
the House-Senate conferees took a final vote on the oil spill
legsilation.
   Jones said his amendment ``establishes an objective benchmark to
assess the adequacy of environmental information'' about drilling
in the mid-Atlantic areas of the Outer Continental Shelf. He said
environmental impact studies used by Mobil are outdated.
   Mobil and several other oil companies bought the leases off the
Carolinas in 1981 and 1983. In September 1988 Mobil announced plans
to explore for natural gas in the area, prompting outcries from
environmentalists and others in the region.
   Residents in the Cape Hatteras area have expressed concern about
the impact drilling might have on tourism and recreational fishing.
State officials have refused to allow Mobil to proceed, but Jones
said there was fear the state might be overruled in Washington.

<HEAD>Food, Medicine Shipments Approved in Mohawk-Quebec Standoff</HEAD>

   Quebec's native affairs minister said
Thursday that food and medicine will be allowed to circulate freely
past police barricades at Oka and Kahnawake, where police and
Mohawks are in the third week of a showdown.
   Police have drawn criticism from residents and human rights
groups for long, rigorous searches of everyone going behind police
lines at the two sites.
   Minister John Ciaccia told a news conference, ``There will be no
restrictions in terms of the delivery of food. It has never been
the policy of this government to do that. I want to clarify this
once for all.''
   Food supplies have sometimes run low in the Kahnawake reserve
south of Montreal and in Oka, where a July 11 gun battle between
Mohawks and provincial police left one officer dead and began the
long siege.
   Blame in the death has not been fixed.
   Police were trying to remove barricades the Indians set up to
protect a parcel of what they say is ancestral land, designated to
become the back nine holes of the local golf course, 18 miles west
of Montrteal.
   Other armed Mohawks have blockaded the Mercier Bridge to
Montreal Island, forcing commuters into long detours, in sympathy
with the Mohawks at Oka.
   Ciaccia said searches of people will continue, but no food will
be confiscated and people will not be detained for hours as they
try to get past with supplies.
   Red Cross relief convoys brought in some food and other basics,
but the Mohawks complained it wasn't enough.
   Free passage of food was one condition laid down by the Mohawks
to get negotiations going again.
   Another condition was unimpeded access to Mohawk positions by
their advisers and lawyers. Ciaccia has not agreed to that.
   Tom Siddon, the federal Indian Affairs minister, indicated to
reporters in Ottawa that the federal and Quebec governments may be
on the road to defusing the crisis. But he suggested federal
efforts to work out a land deal now must be matched by provincial
efforts to resolve police and security issues with the Mohawks.
   Federal and Quebec officials, the town of Oka and French
developer Maxime Rousseau, who owns some of the disputed land, have
reportedly been working on a deal that would see Canada buy the
land and hand it over to the Mohawks.
   Area residents have expressed fear for their lives and property
in the event of another clash.
   But Maj. Gerald Baril, public relations officer for the army in
Quebec, told a news conference in Montreal the Canadian army has no
plans for any attacks on Mohawk barricades in the area.
   Baril said Quebec has not asked for military intervention ``and
there is no indication they will ask.''

   Police investigating a satanic cult said
Thursday they believe the group has killed at least 41 people in
human sacrifices to protect their marijuana crop.
   Authorities said they had seized a leather quiver with 41
arrows. They quoted the cult leader's chief aide as saying each
arrow represents the spirit of a person killed.
   Fourteen men and boys suspected of participating in the occult
rites were arrested Thursday and placed in a Nayarit state prison
in the state capital of Tepic after making statements to
authorities.
   Police said they arrested the group Tuesday as cult members were
cultivating marijuana near Acaponeta in the remote mountain region
on the border of Nayarit and Durango states 450 miles northwest of
Mexico City.
   Group members are being held for homicide, arms possession,
criminal association and drug charges.
   Police said Wednesday they suspected the group was responsible
slaying people in devil-worshipping rituals reminiscent of the Palo
Mayombe religion from the Congo in Africa.
   Police said the group sacrificed its victims before a 16-inch
clay monkey they called ``El Amigo,'' or ``The Friend.''
   They said they had not yet unearthed any bodies. But they said
they found a dagger and bloodstains in caves.
   However, alleged cult leader Olayo Soto Soto told The Associated
Press on Thursday he is not a devil worshiper. ``Those are rumors
and lies of the authorities,'' Soto said in an interview at police
headquarters before being taken to jail.
   His right-hand man, Esteban Mendoza Cervantes, 19, testified
that each of the 41 arrows in police possession represents the
spirit a victim sacrificed in rituals carried on since 1983,
Nayarit district attorney's investigator Jose Fernando Armas
Hernandez said. The arrows appeared to be tipped in blood.
   In an earlier drug-cult case, police in April 1989 found 15
bodies buried on a ranch near the northern city of Matamoros across
the U.S.-Mexico border from Brownsville, Texas.
   They claimed the victims were slain by drug smugglers who
believed human sacrifices would protect them from police.
   Four members of that group are on trial in Mexico City and
Matamoros. Group leader Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo and his bodyguard
died of gunshot wounds as police closed in on them in a Mexico City
apartment in May 1989.

<HEAD>House Approves D.C. Budget With Funds For Abortion</HEAD>
<HEAD>By LeROY TILLMAN</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Thursday left intact funds for
abortions in the District of Columbia but cut money for the city's
university in what officials there say is a dispute over art and
obscenity.
   The spending bill, allocating $542 million for fiscal 1991, was
adopted by a 241-178 vote.
   Provisions allowing abortions for poor women in the nation's
capital were included in the resolution without a floor fight, even
though President Bush has repeatedly threatened to veto such a
measure and has successfully done so in the past.
   City funds, not federal money, would be used to pay for such
operations, said Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J.
   ``D.C. funds pay for abortions upon demand. The language was
included even though the city budget got sent back to Congress
twice last year because of White House opposition to the inclusion
of abortion language,'' he said.
   The House also voted 297-123 in favor of an amendment by Rep.
Stan Parris, R-Va., to cut $1.6 million from the $94.8 million
appropriation for the University of the District of Columbia.
   That amount matches a bond issue approved by the City Council
that would pay for renovation of the Carnegie Library in downtown
Washington where the sculpture ``The Dinner Party'' by feminist
artist Judy Chicago is to be permanently displayed.
   The ceramic piece depicts a large triangular table that contains
female genitalia on 39 place settings. The university's Board of
Trustees approved spending $80,000 of school funds to transport the
work from California, where it is stored, to Washington.
   Nira Hardon Long, chairwoman of the university trustees, said
the acquisition of the sculpture would serve as the centerpiece of
the school's endowment. She called the expenditure ``seed money.''
   ``This has no bearing on the university's ability to pay its
employees,'' she said at the news conference announcing the
acquisition of the sculpture.
   Parris disputed that, saying that several critics had called the
work obscene, and also that the university was lagging in paying
its employees.
   ``I have no quarrel with people who like the sculpture and I
have no desire to act as a censor,'' he said.
   The Senate still has to take up the bill.

   Five outstanding performing artists were
selected Thursday as winners of the 1990 Kennedy Center Honors for
their contributions to the cultural life of the nation.
   Chosen by the board of trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center
for the Performing Arts were jazz trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie,
actress Katharine Hepburn, opera singer Rise Stevens, composer Jule
Steyne and film director and writer Billy Wilder.
   The five will be honored at a black-tie gala performance in the
Kennedy Center Opera House on Dec. 2, which will be taped for
broadcast later as a two-hour CBS TV special. President and Mrs.
Bush will salute the honorees at a White House ceremony before the
gala.
   Kennedy Center Chairman James D. Wolfensohn said the five were
honored ``for enriching all our lives through their lifelong
dedication to their art.''
   The 13th annual honors gala is the Kennedy Center's biggest
fund-raising event of the year. Proceeds will support performing
arts education, public service programming and discount tickets for
students and the elderly.

   Stand-up comedians and business lecturers will
entertain passengers on Continental Express flights next month
between Detroit and Cleveland.
   The 30-passenger flights, which take 45 minutes from gate to
gate, spend 17 minutes in the air, too little time for travelers to
accomplish serious business, Continental Express spokesman Steve
Mason said.
   Business executives from Cleveland and Detroit will give the
lectures on mornings flights from Aug. 6-10. Topics will include
illiteracy in the workplace and trends in radio and television,
said carrier spokeswoman Nancy Compel.
   Professional comedians will entertain during afternoon flights
the same week.
   The entertainment, good only on flights between Cleveland and
Detroit City Airport, won't increase the $280 round-trip price,
Compel said. Continental Express is the commuter division of
Continental Airlines.
   ``We're doing it to call attention to the fact that Continental
has the service,'' Compel said.

   Constituents and colleagues in the 4th
Congressional District had mixed reactions to the reprimand issued
to U.S. Rep. Barney Frank Thursday, but many remained supportive of
their congressman.
   ``I'm torn,'' said Nicole Tufo, 21, who was jogging through
Newton Thursday. ``I think what he did was wrong but I guess I feel
bad for him.''
   Newton City Clerk Edward G. English said Thursday he still
supports Frank. English cited a letter the congressman wrote him in
1981 congratulating him for 10 years of public service.
   ``At a time when so many negative things are being said about
people in public life, it is important to remind people, especially
young people, that public service can be a noble cause,'' the
letter read.
   ``I think he still believes in those principles,'' English said.
   The House voted Thursday to reprimand Frank, D-Mass., for using
his influence on behalf of a male prostitute. The 408-18 vote
imposed the lightest punishment the full House could have given.
   Frank apologized to the House and told a hushed chamber he was
being punished, in part, for actions he took to ``conceal my
homosexuality'' at a time when he had not yet made his gay
lifestyle public.
   Others expressed hope that the incident would finally be over.
   ``I'm sad for Barney,'' said Newton Mayor Thomas Mann. ``I'm sad
for everybody that's gone through so much. I wonder how well others
would have taken this. It's a very sad experience for all of us.''
   Brookline resident Kathi Sadow, who was shopping at a local mall
Thursday, praised Frank despite the House action.
   ``I'm pleased he was just reprimanded even though I have some
concerns about the whole thing. He's an extremely good congressman
who showed extremely bad judgment and we'll vote for him again.''
   Tom Dole, a Framingham mechanic, paused outside his garage and
said he did not support Frank.
   ``You got to look at it this way,'' he said. ``What did they do
to Gerry Studds? They're all crooks. I wouldn't vote for him. I
wouldn't vote for any Democrat.''
   Dole was referring to U.S. Rep. Studds, D-Mass., the only other
acknowledged homosexual member of the House, who was censured in
1983 for sexual relations with a male congressional page.
   Ina Gibson of Roxbury echoed the sentiments of many as she
praised Frank.
   ``Barney Frank has been a very good politician,'' she said. ``I
think he's done a good job. His personal life is his own business
as far as I'm concerned.
   But George Fattell, of Brighton, said House representatives were
``too lenient.''
   ``I think he should have been censured,'' he said.

<HEAD>Barry Lawyer: Black Leaders Targeted By FBI Team</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 12th graf: ``Asked about,'' with comment from Young
spokesman</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The FBI has a team of agents that targeted
Julian Bond, Andrew Young and other black leaders for undercover
sting operations, Marion Barry's lawyer said Thursday at the
mayor's cocaine and perjury trial.
   R. Kenneth Mundy said the team operated in Atlanta, Chicago and
California as well as during the Jan. 18 sting in which Barry was
arrested after being videotaped smoking crack cocaine.
   The FBI initially said it would be inappropriate to comment on
an ongoing trial, but the agency later issued a statement that said
Mundy's allegations were ``totally unfounded and categorically
denied.''
   After testimony ended for the day, Barry told reporters as he
left the courtroom: ``I got the impression that Stern is notorious
for going around the country trying to sting black elected
officials.''
   Mundy's contentions came as the defense neared the end of its
case, questioning agent Ronald Stern, one of the participants in
the Barry sting. The defense spent the day trying to prove the FBI
had entrapped Barry.
   ``Stern in effect moves around the country as the head of an ...
assault force of FBI agents,'' Mundy said during in a bench
conference.
   The jury could not hear the discussion, and U.S. District Court
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson refused to allow Mundy to question
Stern about the allegations.
   Mundy said he wanted to put his comments on the record in case
there was an appeal in the case.
   ``Prior to coming here to organize and orchestrate the sting
against Mr. Barry, Mr. Stern had been in Atlanta trying to set up a
sting of Julian Bond, Andrew Young and two other black politicians
and public figures in Atlanta,'' Mundy said.
   Alice Bond, then the wife of former Georgia state Sen. Julian
Bond, told Atlanta police in 1987 that her estranged husband and
other prominent officials had used cocaine. She recanted her story
after a telephone conversation with then-Mayor Andrew Young.
   Bond denied using drugs and was never charged. Young, who faces
an Aug. 7 runoff for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, was
criticized for calling Mrs. Bond.
   Asked about Mundy's statements, a spokesman for Young, Nehl
Horton, said in Atlanta, ``We have no knowledge of that
whatsoever.''
   Mundy said the information came from two lawyers for government
witnesses in the Barry case, a congressional office and a figure
convicted in the HUD scandal.
   Mundy said the FBI approached a half-dozen women ``in the life
of Mr. Barry'' and tried to get them to cooperate. ``Money was
offered to them,'' but the women refused, Mundy said.
   The defese, Mundy said, had been prepared to present witnesses
to back up his statements and that several black female FBI agents
were offered the role of undercover agent but ``turned it down
because ... they considered it to be morally repulsive.''
   A law enforcement source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
denied Mundy's assertions that other black agents turned down the
sting operation or that a series of women were offered money to
participate in an undercover operation against the mayor.
   Stern testified earlier that agents were ready to abandon the
sting until the mayor suddenly asked for crack cocaine. An
undercover agent carrying crack had left the room after Barry said
he didn't want any, and ``as far as we were concerned, the
operation was over,'' he said.
   ``Mr. Barry called them back into the room,'' Stern said.
   Barry was arrested after being videotaped smoking the crack.
   Stern said Barry was allowed to smoke the crack because to have
stopped the operation before he did would have provided Barry ``too
many possible defenses.''
   ``He could have called his security agents and said: `This woman
just gave me drugs. I want her arrested,''' Stern said.
   A federal prosecutor was in a nearby hotel room watching the
operation and advised the agents that Barry taking the cocaine was
not sufficient for an arrest, Stern said.
   Mundy claimed that sting operations are usually completed ``once
the subject possesses the drugs.'' He has said the government
endangered Barry's health by allowing him to ingest the drugs.
   Mundy said the FBI had pushed the case too far after Barry
``repeatedly'' denied opportunities to use drugs. But Stern said
Barry brought up the subject of drugs as soon as he entered the
room by asking former model Rasheeda Moore ``whether she had been
good.''
   ``Prior to the operation, Miss Moore told me Mr. Barry will ask
if I've been good,'' Stern said. ``She told me that denotes drugs.''
   Ms. Moore testified earlier that she and Barry used drugs ``over
100 times'' and had code words to refer to the drugs.
   Stern said that while they expected Barry to ``bring drugs to
the room or ask for drugs after he got there,'' the government had
some on hand as a contingency.
   Barry is charged with 10 counts of cocaine possession, three
counts of perjury and one count of conspiracy. Jury selection for
the trial began June 4.

<TEXT>
   A North Korean broadcast said Friday
that five North Korean citizens will cross the heavily fortified
border into South Korea during the day, officials said.
   On Thursday, Communist North and capitalist South agreed to have
their prime ministers meet in an unprecedented attempt to end
hostility, but within an hour of signing, a row over the border
crossing had the nations trading insults again.
   The five were invited to Seoul for a two-day meeting to plan a
joint unification rally with South Korean dissidents, scheduled for
Aug. 15.
   It would be the first crossing by civilians with approval of
both governments on the divided Korean peninsula since a 1985
family exchange.
   South Korean authorities quoted North Korea as saying the five
will pass over at Panmunjom, the truce village in the Demilitarized
Zone, and asking that they be met by the South Korean dissidents.
   South Korea cautioned it will allow the border crossing only if
North Korea follows agreed-upon rules to coordinate crossings
between the two governments.
   The five originally were expected to cross the border Thursday.
They arrived at the frontier, but a last-minute glitch developed
over Seoul's housing arrangements. South Korea wanted the group to
stay in a luxury hotel, citing security reasons. The North Koreans
wanted to stay with South Korean dissidents at a church house, and
travel in the dissidents' cars.
   The outcome of that wrangle was not immediately disclosed.
   Name-calling, protests and rhetoric over the accommodations
issue threatened to cloud the premiers' talks.
   North and South Korea were divided in 1945 at the end of World
War II. Despite years of hostility and a three-year civil war in
the early 1950s, unification of their homeland remains a cherished
dream by Koreans on both sides of the border.
   ``A political show,'' said Lee Hae-hak, one of three South
Korean dissident leaders who had gone to the truce village of
Panmunjom to welcome the North Koreans.
   ``Down with (President) Roh Tae-woo who blocks unification!''
the dissidents shouted on Thursday after being told the border
crossing was canceled. ``Our desire is unification,'' the three
sang.
   But even then, South Korea's unification minister, Hong
Sung-chul, insisted, ``Our door remains open.''
   Paik Nam Jun, North Korea's chief delegate at the prime
ministers' talks, warned that disputes over the unification rally
could spill over into the premiers' talks. North Korean radio
blasted South Korea for ``poking their nose into the rally ... and
laying artificial hurdles to foil.''
   The 19-point agreement for prime ministers' talks calls for the
two sides to meet in Seoul Sept. 4-7, and again in the North's
capital of Pyongyang Oct. 16-19.
   By signing the accord, North Korea's Communist government
granted tacit recognition to the legitimacy of the Seoul government
for the first time since separate governments were formed in 1948.
   ``This precious fruit will open a decisive chapter in a road to
ending national division and achieving peaceful unification,'' said
South Korean chief delegate Song Han-ho.
   Song's North Korean counterpart, Paik, said the agreement ``will
open a new chapter in the history of the national division.''
   The two prime ministers _ Kang Young-hoon of South Korea and Yon
Hyung Muk of North Korea _ are ceremonial figureheads with little
policy-making roles. But their meeting would be symbolically
significant as they would be the highest-ranking officials of the
rival states to ever meet.
   The outcome of the rally and the prime ministers' talks are seen
as a gauge of future Korean relations.
   The rally would mark the first contact between civilian
organizations of the two Koreas. In the past, South Korean
authorities have blocked such contacts out of fear they could turn
into radical anti-Seoul protests.
   Proposed sites for the rally include the capitals of either
North or South Korea or Panmunjom. The Aug. 15 date is the 45th
anniversary of the liberation of Korea from Japanese colonial rule
and is a sentimental holiday on both sides of the border.
   South Korea offered last week to open its border to North
Koreans for unrestricted travel for five days starting Aug. 13. It
challenged North Korea to do the same for South Koreans.
   North Korea has said it would open the border on a limited basis
on Aug. 15 to Koreans desiring unification.

   Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall says
he is unsure what to make of President Bush's choice of David H.
Souter for the high court, but suggested it is a politically
motivated appointment dictated by a presidential aide.
   In an interview broadcast Thursday on ABC's ``Primetime Live,''
Marshall also said he would vote against Bush if he runs for
re-election.
   ``It's said that if you can't say something good about a dead
person, don't say it,'' Marshall said of Bush. ``Well, I consider
him dead.''
   Asked by interviewer Sam Donaldson why he thought Bush picked
Souter to replace retired Justice William J. Brennan, Marshall
replied: ``I don't have the slightest idea. Never heard of him
(Souter). I just don't understand what he (Bush) is doing...This
last appointment is the epitome of what he's been doing. I think
somebody's calling his shots.''
   Marshall said the Souter appointment might be the work of
conservative White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, who as
governor of New Hampshire put Souter on that state's Supreme Court.
   Marshall said when Souter's appointment was announced on TV, he
turned to his wife and said, ``Have I ever heard of this man?''
   He said he then called Brennan's home to find out whether he
knew Souter. Marshall said Brennan's wife answered the phone and
said Brennan ``never heard of him either.''
   Asked about his feelings toward Bush, Marshall said, ``If he
came up for election, I'd vote against him.''
   Asked if he believes Bush is running for re-election, the
justice said, ``I don't think he's ever stopped.''
   Marshall did not detail what political considerations he thought
might be underlying the Souter nomination.
   Marshall, 82, a staunch liberal ally of Brennan on the high
court, has been outspoken in the past about another Republican
president, Ronald Reagan.
   In a televised interview in 1987, Marshall said Reagan ``ranks
at the bottom'' among U.S. presidents in terms of their civil
rights records.
   In the ABC interview, which was conducted Wednesday in
Marshall's office in the Supreme Court building, the justice said
he expects to be voting in the minority a lot more because of
Brennan's departure.
   ``There's nobody here that can persuade the way Brennan can
persuade,'' Marshall said. ``Brennan will sit down and talk to you
and show you where you're wrong. Well, there's nobody with that
power on the court today. I say that Brennan cannot be replaced.''
   Marshall also praised Brennan for his sense of humor and ability
to deal with adversaries as friends.
   ``If you're wrong, he'll _ in the most gentle language _ let you
down. There's not a vicious bone in his body. He's a real ...
Bill's a gentleman,'' Marshall said.
   He added that he is not discouraged by Brennan's retirement.
   ``It's not going to slow me down at all,'' he said. ``I asked
each one of my law clerks that I hired for this year ...`Do you
mind writing dissenting opinions?'''
   Brennan announced his retirement last Friday, and Bush picked
Souter to replace him on Monday. Before then, Souter was largely
unknown outside of New Hampshire.
   Marshall also repeated what he has said many times before _ that
he was appointed to a life term on the court and means to serve it.
   But, he said, ``I have a deal with my wife that when I begin to
show any signs of senility, she'll tell me. And she will.''
   Marshall also said one of the differences between him and
Brennan is that ``He tells jokes. He doesn't tell dirty ones like I
tell.''

<HEAD>Explorer Awarded Libel Damages from Canadian Magazine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes was awarded $181,000
in libel damages Wednesday for an article in the Canadian magazine
Maclean's, which said his exploits achieved nothing of historical
or scientific value.
   The magazine said it will appeal.
   A High Court jury in London took only 40 minutes to decide that
Fiennes was justified in complaining that an article in the weekly
magazine was ``nasty, mean-minded and spiteful.'' He asked the jury
to ``nail the lie'' that his expeditionary efforts were valueless.
   The April 1988 article said: ``Prince Charles always supports
him, claiming great results for British exports, but no one has
ever been able to demonstrate that any scientific or historical
benefits have resulted.''
   The damages, and an estimated $135,750 in legal costs, were
awarded against editor Kevin Doyle, journalist Allan Fotheringham
and British publishers Maclean Hunter. The defendants denied the
words bore any defamatory meaning.
   ``I feel completely vindicated. But I will have to wait for it
to sink in properly,'' Fiennes, 46, said after the verdict.
   His wife, Virginia, who accompanied him on many expeditions,
said: ``The damages are astonishingly high. We never expected
anything like that.''
   Judge Sir Michael Davies imposed a freeze order on all but
$13,500 of the award, pending a possible appeal by the magazine on
the issues of liability and damages.
   In Toronto, Doyle said an appeal has been filed.
   Doyle said of the amount awarded, ``I think the award was crazy.
It was not commensurate with the words that were written. ''
   Fiennes flew home for the three-day trial from Dhofar in the
Persian Gulf state of Oman, where he is preparing for an
archaeological expedition in search of remains of the Sumerians,
founders of the Babylonian culture in about 4000 B.C.
   He told the jury the article poked fun at him and his
background, calling him a ``professional bore'' and a ``cadger of
the first order.''
   He said Maclean's sells 600,000 copies in Canada and only 400 in
Britain, but it goes to the Foreign Office, foreign libraries and
embassies.
   Summing up, the judge said the whole article might suggest that
Fiennes was ``an upper class twit, not a real explorer but a
bumbling playboy.''
   Fiennes said there was danger that potential sponsors of his
future expeditions would withdraw financial backing if they read
the article.
   The explorer is a former army officer who has led expeditions to
both poles, Sudan and Norway and one around the world's polar axis,
as well as a score of research projects.

   A Honduran drug trafficker was found guilty
Thursday of racketeering, kidnapping and conspiracy in the 1985
abduction of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena and his pilot, who
were killed in Mexico.
   The jury that convicted Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros acquitted
him of Camarena's murder, a crime that has strained relations
between the United States and Mexico.
   Matta's lawyer, Martin Stolar, said outside court the verdict
was inconsistent and showed ``jury confusion.''
   Stolar told reporters he believed extensive testimony about drug
trafficking and corruption in the Mexican government had distracted
jurors from the main issue _ Camarena's killing _ and had created
the confusion.
   He said he would appeal the convictions, and asked U.S. District
Judge Edward Rafeedie to overrule the jury's findings.
   Matta was one of four defendants charged in the Camarena case,
but the jurors did not return verdicts against the others.
   They didn't give a progress report on deliberations on the other
three defendants, and Rafeedie told the they could return Friday to
resume their deliberations.
   The 31-year-old Camarena was kidnapped off a street in
Guadalajara, Mexico, in February 1985, tortured and interrogated by
drug lords before being slain along with his Mexican pilot, Alfredo
Zavala Avelar.
   After Camarena's battered body was discovered a month later,
Mexican authorities eventually pinned the blame on Rafael Caro
Quintero, a swaggering 29-year-old leader of the powerful
Guadalajara drug cartel.
   Camarena's colleagues were skeptical that the reckless,
illiterate ``Rafa'' had acted alone. The American authorities
broadened their investigation to seek out the brains in the cartel,
including members of Mexico's power elite and Matta, a wealthy
Honduran businessman also known as ``El Negro.''
   Prosecutors have said the cartel was incensed after Camarena's
undercover work led to the November 1984 seizure of 10,000 tons of
marijuana.
   The trial was the second stemming from Camarena's murder, a
crime which angry U.S. authorities characterized as a reflection of
official corruption in Mexico.
   Judge Rafeedie also presided over the first trial, which
resulted in the conviction of three men in 1988.
   Disputes between Mexico and the United States over the case have
erupted on several occasions throughout the investigation and
trials.
   Earlier this month, Mexico said it would seek the extradition of
a Los Angeles-based DEA agent and a Mexican informant who allegedly
plotted the kidnapping of a Guadalajara doctor accused in the
killing.
   Matta, a ealthy Honduran businessman, showed little reaction to
the verdict, except to shake his head slightly as if in disbelief.
   Matta's stature in his native Honduras was such that his forced
extradition in 1988 touched off street riots that left five people
dead and torched the U.S. Embassy annex. Hondurans apparently were
angered by the extradition and alarmed that Matta's prosecution
might harm the nation's economy because he owned so many businesses.
   Tears streamed down the faces of his family, who sat in the
courtroom as the verdicts were announced.
   Earlier this year, Matta was convicted by another jury of
operating a cocaine smuggling business.
   Matta was convicted in the ninth day of jury deliberations on
charges of racketeering in the kidnapping and murder of Camarena,
conspiring to kidnap Camarena and the actual crime of kidnapping
the agent and holding him for interrogation.
   But jurors rejected the count that charged Matta with actually
murdering the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent.
   Sentencing was set for Sept. 25.
   Earlier, the jury had suggested in a note to the judge that some
of the counts seemed to be convicting the defendant twice for the
same crime _ a possible reason for the split verdict.
   Stolar insisted in his out-of-court statements that Matta was
tried illegally, both in the Camarena case and in the earlier drug
trafficking case, because he had been kidnapped from Tegucigalpa by
American authorities.
   Stolar had filed numerous challenges based on Matta's arrest,
and all were rejected on appeal. Matta has been serving a life
sentence on the drug conviction.
   The DEA has vowed to capture every person involved in the
slaying. So far, 22 people have been charged in this country and
more than 20 convicted in Mexico. Among those held is Rafael Caro
Quintero, alleged leader of the drug operation.
   The other defendants in the current trial, who were present
during the reading of verdicts against Matta, were: Ruben Zuno
Arce, a Guadalajara businessman who is the brother-in-law of former
Mexican President Luis Echeverria; Juan Jose Bernabe Ramirez, a
former Mexican homicide officer and Javier Vasquez Velasco, a
former bodyguard accused of murdering two American tourists in an
apparent mistake killing.

   Ethiopia's foreign minister said Thursday the
East African country is abandoning communist goals and wants to
improve relations with the United States.
   Foreign Minister Tesfaye Dinka also accused Eritrean insurgents,
who control parts of Northern Ethiopia of blocking food relief
shipments to Ethiopians threatened with starvation as a result of
the 29-year rebellion. He appealed for international pressure for
the rebels to relent.
   The accusation echoed a statement earlier this week by Andrew
Natsios, an American disaster assistance official, who said the
rebels had closed Massawa port to a food-laden Danish freighter
flying the U.N. flag.
   Tesfaye's comments came at a news conference prior to his
meeting with Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger,
marking one of the highest-level U.S.-Ethiopian talks in a decade.
   Later, Tesfaye called called his one-hour meeting with
Eagleburger ``an important milestone'' toward improving relations
long downgraded in disagreement over human rights abuses in
Ethiopia.
   The foreign minister denied ``any kind of linkage'' between a
supply of weapons from Israel to Ethiopian Jews being allowed to
emigrate. He said Ethiopia had not received any arms from Israel
since reopening relations with the Jewish state last November.
   The Ethiopian and Israeli governments are in ``complete
understanding'' on the emigration issue and the flow of emigrants
is continuing, he said.
   A U.S. official, who insisted on anonymity, said that a reported
supply of Israeli weapons for Ethiopia was limited to rifles and
did not include cluster bombs which Ethiopia was said to be seeking
for use against the rebels.
   The Ethiopian government, led by Mengistu Haile Mariam, is
undertaking economic and political changes that will result in a
market-oriented economy, greater incentives for domestic and
foreign investors and political diversity, Tesfaye said.
   He said 65 percent to 70 percent of Ethiopia's economy always
had been operated by an entrenched private sector.
   Perestroika, the Soviet reform policy, helped influence the
changes in Ethiopia, he said, adding that relations with Moscow
remain good.
   Tesfaye said he was hopeful of improved U.S.-Ethiopian relations
after a meeting Wednesday with Assistant Secretary of State Herman
Cohen.
   The two governments have maintained low-level diplomatic
relations without ambassadors for the past 10 years amid
disagreement over repression and human rights abuse in Ethiopia.

   A juror who phoned members of the Medellin
drug cartel was kicked off a panel deciding a $32 million drug
money-laundering case Thursday, but the remaining 11 jurors
continued deliberating.
   U.S. District Judge WIlliam Terrell Hodges scolded the juror,
Robert ``Skip'' Spanczak, but decided the incident wasn't
prejudicial enough to declare a mistrial in the case of five
international bankers and a Colombian associated with the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International.
   ``It was simply curiosity on my part and nothing happened,''
Spanczak, a 54-year-old Clearwater limousine driver, explained to
the judge during a three-hour hearing. ``Nothing came of this, you
know. ... No real bad intent was meant.''
   Hodges sent Spanczak home with a warning not to talk about the
case until a verdict is reached, but decided against charging him
with contempt of court.
   But he immediately sequestered the 11 remaining members of the
panel, which has sat through more than six months of testimony and
was in its fifth day of deliberations.
   In Spanczak's account, released in court transcripts, he
admitted making a call to Colombia on Friday, the first day of jury
deliberations.
   He said he dialed a number taken from an address book that
authorities seized from one of the defendants, Rudolf Armbrecht of
Colombia, when Armbrecht was arrested in October 1988. Prosecutors
introduced the book as evidence, and testimony indicated the
numbers belonged to members of the drug cartel.
   Spanczak said a Spanish-speaking man answered and later passed
the phone to a man who spoke broken English. When the juror asked
to speak about Armbrecht, the reply was ``No, no, no.''
   But jurors said they received a different version of Spanczak's
call when he told them about it over lunch. They said the voice on
the phone simply told him to destroy the number and never call
again.
   Another juror told the FBI that Spanczak conducted his own
investigation of Armbrecht because he once said ``he would do
anything it took to nail this guy.''
   The jurors husband reported the incident to the FBI, which
reportedly relayed the information to the U.S. Attorney's office
and the judge.
   Attorneys and defendants in the case refused to comment on the
judge's decision to proceed with the case because a gag order has
been in effect since the beginning of the trial.
   The Bank of Credit and Commerce International officials were
arrested Oct. 6, 1988, at a bachelor party and wedding staged by
the U.S. Customs Service to lure them to Tampa.
   They are accused of conspiring with an undercover Customs agent
to launder $14 million in proceeds from the sale of cocaine in six
U.S. cities. During the two-year investigation, the government
processed $32 million in partnership with a Medellin cash launderer.
   Two subsidiaries of the Luxembourg-based bank, known as BCCI,
pleaded guilty in January to the money-laundering charges and
forfeited $15 million to the government, by far the largest
laundering penalty ever assessed against a bank.
   The defendants in the case are Ian Howard and Sibte Hassan of
BCCI's Paris branch; Amjad Awan, who is from a prominent Pakistani
family; and Akbar A. Bilgrami of the bank's Miami branch; Syed
Aftab Hussain, who worked in Panama; and the Colombian aircraft
broker, Armbrecht.
   Awan has claimed to be deposed Panamanian ruler Manuel Noriega's
personal banker.

   Apparently successful in intimidating
Kuwait into ending oil overproduction, Iraq has agreed to pull
thousands of troops back from the countries' disputed border and
negotiate, diplomatic sources say.
   Official Iraqi newspapers suddenly stopped their daily attacks
on Kuwait today. Diplomatic sources said late Wednesday that tens
of thousands of troops reportedly sent to the border earlier this
week by President Saddam Hussein would begin withdrawing today.
   But Saddam has not backed down on demands that Kuwait cut oil
production, pay for oil Baghdad claims was pumped illegally from a
field that straddles the countries' border and forgive billions of
dollars in loans.
   Oil-rich Iraq, strapped for cash after a fall in crude prices
and a costly war with Iran, last week threatened military action
against fellow oil producers Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates
for contributing to the overproduction that has driven down the
price of crude.

   As a state judge nine years ago, Supreme
Court nominee David Souter urged New Hampshire's legislature not to
adopt a law that would have empowered judges to approve abortions
for minors if their parents refuse permission.
   Souter did not express a personal stand on the issue, but said
his fellow judges had decided that a measure then pending before
the state legislature would promote ``shopping for judges'' because
it did not include guidelines on how judges should act. Therefore,
he said, the bill would unfairly leave such decisions up to
individual judges with varied opinions on abortion, resulting in
inconsistent application of any such law.
   The 1981 letter, written to the chairwoman of the legislative
committee considering a parental consent bill, is one of Souter's
few public actions addressing the abortion issue.
   In his one abortion-related decision on the issue as a judge,
Souter gave little insight as to how he might vote if confirmed and
confronted with the opportunity to overturn the 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision legalizing abortion.

   North and South Korea signed a historic

   The planned fall talks would be the first of their kind since
1948 and would focus on easing political and military tensions,
promoting exchanges and other moves toward cooperation between the
two long-hostile states.
   By signing the accord, the North Korean government of Kim Il

<TEXT>
   Some policemen react to the slaughter
of comrades by the drug lords' hired killers with the midnight
knock, torture and summary executions, say witnesses and relatives
of civilian victims.
   A teen-ager in a Medellin slum said he was standing on a corner
a few weeks ago when a car roared up and screeched to a halt.
   ``Some men jumped out and tried to shove me into the trunk,'' he
said. ``I fought back and managed to get away when neighbors of my
family started screaming.''
   Hundreds of other slum youngsters suspected of taking drug money
to kill policemen have been less fortunate.
   More than 200 policemen in the Medellin area have been killed
this year in a war between the cocaine cartel and security forces.
   No official figures are available on slain teen-agers, but the
weekly news magazine La Semana said in its July 16 edition that
Medellin death squads had killed about 1,500 people in 1990.
   Mayor Omar Florez of Medellin said there was little doubt some
policemen and soldiers were violating human rights.
   ``Security forces who act outside the law are aggravating the
state of violence and must be held accountable for their actions,''
he said in an interview.
   So far, the central government in Bogota has been unwilling or
unable to stop the killings, which occur almost daily.
   People are snatched from the streets of slums and their bodies,
bound hand and foot, often turn up in vacant lots or along highways.
   The attorney general's office has concluded in the past that
policemen were involved in death squads. Medellin police deny the
accusations and say most of the killings result from gang rivalry.
   Emilio Suarez, a 62-year-old resident of Medellin, said of the
war between drug traffickers and police: ``You in the United States
see this as a battle of the good guys against the bad guys, but we
view it as the bad guys against the bad guys.''
   A woman who lives in the El Playon slum spoke tearfully of her
15-year-old son, now dead:
   ``The law itself killed my boy. He was just a regular,
hard-working high school student. That boy was my last hope. We are
poor, and I was counting on him for survival.''
   She and many others interviewed asked that their names not be
used. They were afraid of being killed by one side or the other.
   Death squad activity has diluted public confidence in the
authorities. ``The fact that officials have so little support from
the people explains their failure in smashing the drug trade,'' a
human rights activist said.
   He said the human rights organization he leads had scores of
reports of murder, disappearances and torture committed by
policemen and soldiers.
   People are blindfolded, hanged by the neck, beaten with sticks
or forced to spend the night with bags over their heads while being
questioned, he said.
   ``The army and police have become a symbol of death,'' the
activist declared. ``They are carrying out a policy of
extermination.''
   He asked not to be identified because his three predecessors
were murdered.
   Mayor Florez has invited victims of police abuse to speak out
and press charges.
   ``We are trying to reach the people to tell them they can come
to us, the mayor's office, for help, but they are mostly keeping
quiet because a climate of terror has been created here,'' he said..
   The mother of the murdered 15-year-old said she was too
frightened to step forward because ``I have been told that I too
would be killed if I say anything.''
   President Virgilio Barco has been praised abroad for the
crackdown on drug traffickers he began a year ago, but domestic
critics say his emergency measures opened the way to human rights
violations.
   Cesar Gaviria, the president elect, told reporters recently the
government cannot fight the drug war with repression alone.
   ``The country's gravest problem now is violence in Medellin and
this will require special treatment from my government, a treatment
that transcends just military, police and public order measures,''
he said.
   Gaviria, who takes office Aug. 7, pledged to support Florez's
$100 million plan for rebuilding poor neighborhoods in this city of
2 million people.
   Julio Jaramillo, a priest who recently published a study of
Medellin violence, said the president and national security chiefs
still had enough public support to bring offending policemen to
justice.
   Many ranking officers have been replaced during an ambitious
reorganization of the army and police begun in June.
   Florez said the shakeup would demonstrate that the government's
intentions were good and ``will create an atmosphere which will
allow people to trust authorities again.''

<HEAD>Schneider vs. Pell _ Personalities Aside, They're Similar People</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 19th graf, Pell supported, to CORRECT title to
Providence Business News sted Providence Business Journal</NOTE>

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rhode Island's U.S. Senate race is a
study in contrasts and a contest between soulmates. It is a matchup
between two very different individuals with very similar voting
records.
   Democratic Sen. Claiborne Pell is 71. His GOP challenger, Rep.
Claudine Schneider, is 43.
   Pell is a dignified, soft-spoken man, usually with a rumpled
suit draped over his tall, bony frame. Miss Schneider is a zealous,
energetic woman given to wearing brightly colored dresses and known
more by her first name than her last.
   ``The ideological differences between them are subtle, if any,''
says Washington analyst Charles Cook.
   ``Name one member of Congress who's like either one of them,''
Cook said. ``You can't.''
   Although intense campaigning won't begin until Labor Day, Pell
has the early advantage. He held a 51 percent to 36 percent lead
over Miss Schneider in a recent Brown University poll, a lead that
has grown since an earlier survey in February. The latest poll had
a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
   Pell also has the edge at the bank. As of June 30, his warchest
was double that of Miss Schneider's _ $1.3 million to $627,000.
   But those numbers could change quickly in a race where both
candidates have popularity ratings higher than 80 percent. Neither
candidate has any opposition in Rhode Island's Sept. 11 primary.
   Even when it comes to the paranormal, there aren't many
distinctions between the two candidates. Both have been called a
bit eccentric because of their well-publicized affinities for such
subjects _ Pell for his interest in UFOs and Miss Schneider for
hers in astrology.
   It is a race where both candidates have pledged to keep
themselves out of the negative-campaigning gutter _ each has aired
commercials that don't mention the other's name.
   Last week, Miss Schneider launched the first real offensive of
the campaign. But rather than call Pell a liar, she politely asked
him to ``correct misleading information'' about a Social Security
proposal.
   Nor does she have a monopoly on manners. Pell ordered his
campaign manager, Mary Beth Cahill, to call Miss Schneider's
campaign to inform them that his first commercial would be airing
the next day.
   ``I was stunned,'' said Ellen Conaway, Miss Schneider's campaign
manager. ``In all my years in the business I've never seen anyone
telegraph their moves like that.''
   ``I expect as positive a campaign as both of us can wage. I know
it will be on my side,'' Pell said. ``I've always sought to talk
about my own plans, not to mention or be critical of my adversary.
Except for correcting my record, I would not want to go negative
myself.''
   Miss Schneider's challenge is to attract Democratic votes in a
heavily Democratic state. She has done it in the past, but not
against Pell.
   ``After 10 years in the House,'' she told a meeting of Pawtucket
Rotarians recently, ``I am of the opinion that if I can't be in a
position of greater power ... I do not want to remain in public
service.''
   The senator's camp believes Miss Schneider can't give voters a
good reason to make the switch.
   Voters hoping to find some clarity in the candidates' voting
records are out of luck. Miss Schneider, long considered a GOP
maverick, voted against President Bush more often than did Pell.
   Pell supported Bush's position 51 times in 1989 and opposed the
White House 48 times, according to the Providence Business News.
Miss Schneider voted with the administration 38 times, and opposed
it on 56 occasions.
   Miss Schneider is a firm believer in the adage of former House
Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill that ``all politics is local,'' a
line she repeats often.
   Pell, on the other hand, is chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, a prestigious post but not one that lends
itself to local politics.
   Therefore, Pell plays up his work in education. It's hard to
find a college student or graduate who hasn't heard of Pell grants,
a source of federal aid for millions of needy students.
   It's been a long time since either candidate faced serious
competition.
   Pell won with 73 percent of the vote in 1984 and 75 percent in
1978. Miss Schneider lost to Democratic Rep. Edward Beard in 1978,
but beat him two years later and her winning margins have increased
steadily since. In 1986 and 1988, she won re-election with 72
percent of the vote.

<HEAD>`American Masters' Looks at the Life and Times of Edward R. Murrow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is time for another generation to learn about
Edward R. Murrow, a CBS newsman who died 25 years ago.
   And there is no better way to begin than with ``Edward R.
Murrow: This Reporter'' airing Monday nights on PBS' series
``American Masters'' for the next two weeks.
   Director Susan Steinberg and writer Ed Apfel wisely let Murrow's
story tell itself, with archival footage and interviews with his
colleagues, friends and family. It's narrated by the gorgeous
beefsteak voice of Charles Kuralt.
   ``This Reporter'' is a definitive TV portrait of America's
greatest broadcast journalist. Murrow personified the highest
standards of his craft and ended his 22-year career as its
conscience and its prophet.
   Murrow's broadcast career began in 1937, when he was a CBS news
executive sent to Europe to set up a network of correspondents to
cover the gathering storm. From the start, he insisted on good
reporters, not professional announcers.
   ``Murrow's Boys,'' who included Eric Sevareid, Howard K. Smith,
Charles Collingwood, William Shirer, Richard C. Hottelet and Bill
Shadel, reported World War II from all fronts. Murrow, though,
became the greatest of them.
   ``This ... is London,'' his deep, resonant baritone reported
from the embattled city at the height of the Blitz, electrifying
the U.S. radio audience in the days before this country entered
World War II.
   After the war, with the advent of television, he and his
colleagues learned the new medium, virtually inventing the form of
TV news documentary.
   Murrow's high, furrowed brow and ever-present cigarette _ he
smoked three or four packs a day _ were trademarks of his weekly
prime time news show ``See It Now,'' which began in 1951.
   He took television to cover its first war, Korea in 1952.
   In 1953, ``See It Now'' reported the case of an Air Force
officer who was discharged on the grounds that his father and
sister were communist sympathizers. Public reactions forced the
officer's reinstatement.
   ``It was the first time, I think, that Ed and all of us
understood the power of television,'' said Murrow's longtime
producer Fred W. Friendly, who went on to head CBS News.
   Murrow's career peaked in March 1954, when ``See It Now''
reported on Sen. Joseph McCarthy, R-Wis., and his demagogic,
Red-baiting investigation of alleged Communist infiltration of the
U.S. government. Murrow's wrapup:
   ``The actions of the junior senator from Wisconsin have caused
alarm and dismay amongst our allies abroad and given considerable
comfort to our enemies, and whose fault is that? Not really his. He
didn't create this situation of fear; he merely exploited it, and
rather successfully. Cassius was right: `The fault, dear Brutus, is
not in our stars but in ourselves.'''
   Then, brow furrowed, Murrow ended with his trademark closing:
``Goodnight and good luck.''
   It was one of the greatest moments in television history. It
marked the beginning of the end for McCarthyism. And it marked the
beginning of Murrow's downfall.
   He had become too powerful and CBS knew it. Over the next six
years his declining health let the network erode his power and
influence. No journalist ever again will be as powerful.
   In a 1958 speech, Murrow accused television of breaking its
promise:
   ``If this instrument is good for nothing but to entertain, amuse
and insulate, then the tube is flickering now and we will soon see
that the struggle is lost,'' he said.
   ``This instrument can teach, it can illuminate, yes, and even it
can inspire. But it can do so only to the extent that humans are
determined to use it to those ends. Otherwise it's nothing but
wires and lights in a box.''
   Murrow died of lung cancer on April 27, 1965. As Eric Sevareid
said on that day, ``He was a shooting star; we will live in his
afterglow a very long time.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Elsewhere in television ...
   FURTHER EVIDENCE THAT MURROW WAS RIGHT: Words like
``shudderingly hideous,'' ``stupid'' and ``awful'' just bubble
right out of people who've seen ``Room for Romance,'' a one-hour
anthology series starting on CBS tonight.
   It's brought to you by Douglas S. Cramer, who's partly to blame
for ``Love Boat.'' The publicity says the show's about ``the happy,
poignant, romantic and humorous situations facing residents of an
upscale apartment building.''
   Right. And ``Love Boat'' was an epic of the sea.
   Rebecca Harrell plays an awful, precocious, wise-cracking kid.
Dom Irrerra plays a sardonic concierge. Don Novello (best known as
Father Guido Sarducci) was supposed to play him, but must have seen
the script.
   ``Room for Romance'' takes dead aim on issues of the day.
Unfortunately, the day is sometime in the '70s, and the issues are
superstition, breaking up and living with your fiancee. It's so
stupid it'll take points off your IQ.
   You have been warned.

<HEAD>Williams Hopes Traditionally Democratic `Dog' Won't Hunt</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DAINGERFIELD, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The strong turnout was reflected in
Clayton Williams' broad grin.
   It was 9 a.m. on a weekday morning, and more than 150 people
were gathered on the tree-shaded lawn of the Cumberland
Presbyterian Church to meet Williams, the Republican candidate for
governor.
   ``That,'' he said, ``is great.''
   ``It's the biggest gathering for a Republican candidate ever
since we've been here _ about 20 years,'' said Harry Bartlett,
whose son, Steve, is a GOP congressman from Dallas. ``This is a
very strong Democratic county.''
   Williams is a West Texas oilman-rancher who wants East Texas
votes.
   To get them, he knows he must attract ``Yellow Dog'' Democrats _
party loyalists whom legend says would vote for a yellow dog as
long as it ran as a Democrat.
   Stumping in churchyards, restaurants and courthouse squares on a
recent campaign swing, Williams offers them a handshake, a speech,
a little barbecue, and what he hopes will be a winning message.
   ``I'm a farmer. I'm a rancher. I grew up in a small town.
Small-town values, old-fashioned values, are still the horse I
believe is the one to ride,'' he said.
   ``I probably more truly represent what Texans think they need
and what they want in a governor.''
   The Texas governor's office is one of the top prizes of the 1990
elections. Texas stands to pick up three or four U.S. House seats
from redistricting based on the results of the 1990 census, and
both parties want to have the governor on their side when the lines
are redrawn. Republican Gov. Bill Clements is retiring.
   Williams jumped out to an early lead in the race but his
Democratic rival, two-term state Treasurer Ann Richards, is putting
up a spirited fight to narrow the gap. Williams' foray into the
Democratic stronghold of East Texas is part of his strategy to woo
the rural votes that will play a big role in selecting Texas' next
governor.
   In his campaign speeches, Williams discusses a string of issues
he believes give him a ``values'' edge over Richards.
   _ Abortion. He's opposed except in cases of rape, incest and
danger to a mother's life. He wants a law requiring parents to
consent before a minor daughter could obtain an abortion.
   _ Gun control. No more laws. ``We need to keep our guns,'' he
said.
   _ Flag-burning. ``It makes my blood boil,'' he said.
   _ Crime. Williams promises to double the number of prison cells
and introduce youthful offenders to ``the joys of bustin' rocks.''
That line from his TV commercials is so popular, audiences shout it
out before he does.
   ``I'm here in East Texas appealing to people whose values are my
values ... I have a lot in common with the folks here,'' he said.
   The 29-county East Texas region is Democratic territory.
Williams was reminded at a stop in Gilmer that no GOP candidate had
won a county office in a half century.
   But Republicans say they are making inroads.
   In the 1984 U.S. Senate race, Republican Phil Gramm carried 18
of the counties. In 1986, Democratic Gov. Mark White lost the
region to Clements.
   ``Philosophically, the people of East Texas are very
conservative,'' said state GOP Chairman Fred Meyer. ``Their values
are very much the values of the Republican Party. But they've got a
little more of that yellow dog tradition.''
   With Gramm seeking re-election and Williams hitting small towns,
Meyer is optimistic.
   ``Frankly, our organization has been a little weaker in East
Texas than many other areas of the state ... But whatever we've
done in the past, we're going to do better this time,'' he said.
   Democrats say they are taking nothing for granted, and Richards
is working hard to win East Texas votes.
   ``It's an important region for victory for anybody running
statewide,'' said Richards campaign consultant Glenn Smith. ``She's
been there a lot.''
   Ed Martin, executive director of the Texas Democratic Party,
said East Texans won't change parties just because Republicans call
themselves the conservatives.
   ``East Texans are conservative, but they're also populists. They
think government ought to work for the little guy, for working
people,'' Martin said. ``The Republicans aren't conservative. What
they do is come down to Austin and try to stuff money into the
pockets of rich people.''
   Some conservative Democrats disagree. Democratic state Rep. Bill
Hollowell endorsed Williams over Richards last week.
   ``Her platform is so foreign to those of us who believe in
conservative to moderate values that I'm going to have to cross the
party line on this race,'' said Hollowell. He acknowledged having
voted for some Republicans in the past as well.
   Martin downplayed such defections and accused Williams of
distorting Richards' record on issues such as gun control, where
she supports a waiting period for people who want to buy
semiautomatic assault rifles.
   ``Clayton Williams claims she favors gun control. That's just
not true,'' Martin said. ``Ann Richards thinks a law-abiding Texan
ought to be able to buy a handgun to protect his home, or a deer
rifle to go hunting.''

   Filmmaker Spike Lee has been celebrated as a
trailblazing filmmaker, the talk of the Cannes Film Festival and a
Hollywood maverick.
   But residents of the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn _ where he
recently opened a store that sells memorabilia from his movies _
insist that he's still one of their own.
   ``You have to respect Spike,'' said Marc Sweeting, 20, a college
student, as he looked at T-shirts inside the shop called Spike's
Joint.
   ``He came from Brooklyn. He makes his movies in Brooklyn. And he
put his store right here. He didn't go off to Hollywood with
everything. There's not enough black-owned businesses here and he's
still trying to support the community.''
   Juliette Spencer, a model and waitress, was in Spike's Joint the
same day, buying a key chain bearing the words ``Forty Acres and a
Mule,'' the name of Lee's production company a block away from the
store.
   ``I've seen him on the street a lot of times, and his father and
sister, too,'' she said. ``He's always very friendly. He always
says hello.''
   Customers who shop at Spike's Joint have their choice of
T-shirts, posters, books, caps, postcards and other items
commemorating his movies ``Do the Right Thing,'' ``She's Gotta Have
It,'' ``School Daze'' and his latest film, ``Mo' Better Blues,''
which premiered in New York on July 23 and opens nationwide Aug. 3.
   For the truly avant-garde Spike Lee fan, there are shirts
bearing the words ``Jungle Fever,'' the name of his next movie, to
be released in 1991.
   There's also something for the fan who can't get enough of ``Do
the Right Thing,'' which depicted racial tensions that led to a
boycott and the eventual destruction of an Italian-owned pizzeria
in Bedford-Stuyvesant, a predominantly black neighborhood about a
mile from Fort Greene.
   During a recent visit to Spike's Joint, a videotape of ``Do the
Right Thing'' played on two televisions _ one inside the store and
one in the window _ with the sound piped into the street. A small
crowd stood watching throughout the afternoon.
   Lee's first film was ``Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads''
in 1982. It was his thesis work at New York University Film School,
and won the student academy award from the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences.
   When Island Pictures released ``She's Gotta Have It,'' about a
sexually independent young woman, Lee was lionized as the leader of
a new wave of independent filmmaking. He had made the 1986 lusty
black-and-white movie for an amazing $175,000.
   ``She's Gotta Have It'' grossed $8 million, impressing David
Puttnam, then head of Columbia Pictures. Puttnam commissioned
``School Daze,'' a musical satire of fraternity life at a black
campus. Although it received mixed reviews, it was Columbia's
biggest moneymaker for 1988, grossing $14.5 million.
   With ``Do the Right Thing,'' a frank, realistic and beautifully
filmed portrait of racism and its byproducts, the brash young
filmmaker entered the mainstream.
   Born in Atlanta, Lee was raised in Brooklyn by his father, Bill,
a jazz musician who composes his son's film scores, and a mother
who taught art. He attended Morehouse College as an undergraduate,
and then went to NYU.
   Lee, 33, opened Spike's Joint on July 22 in the middle-class
Fort Greene neighborhood where neatly kept brownstones and grand,
tall trees line nearly every street.
   Lee lives in Fort Greene, and his film crews have shot scenes
there. His sister, Joie Lee, who played his sister in ``Do the
Right Thing,'' had a small role in ``She's Gotta Have It'' and
co-stars with Denzel Washington in ``Mo' Better Blues,'' is often
spotted getting on the D train at the local subway station.
   ``I ran into Spike a few times on the street,'' said Kyle
Ridley, 26, a student at the Brooklyn campus of Long Island
University, about six blocks from the store. ``We put our money
into seeing his movies; why not the store?''
   Spike's Joint is across the street from Brooklyn Technical High
School. One customer, Michael Tracy, a Tech graduate and now a City
College student, made a pilgrimage back to the area to buy a
T-shirt. ``I've seen all his films, and I'm hoping to be a
filmmaker myself,'' he said.
   Lee opened the store because he was besieged by fan mail and
phone calls requesting buttons, T-shirts and other movie
memorabilia.
   On opening day at the store, Lee bristled when a reporter
suggested that some of the store's profits might be funneled back
to the community.
   ``When white people start a business no one says a word. Black
people want to make some money, it's, `So Spike, are you going to
give all your money back to the community?''' he mocked.
   Lee said he hopes to use his profits to finance his own movies.
Now he relies on studio financing, including $10 million for ``Mo'
Better Blues.''
   His customers were concerned with smaller sums, however _
postcards, two for $1, T-shirts, $12 and $15, unframed posters,
$10, and a leather-sleeved ``Do the Right Thing'' jacket, a cool
$300.
   ``I like that jacket,'' said Sweeting's friend, Desiree Clarke.
   ``I have a strong feeling I'm going to be spending $300 at some
point,'' he said with a grin.

   At the crack of dawn one
Wednesday, 1,500 soldiers swarmed into this seaside town and herded
thousands of people onto the cricket field.
   One by one, the people were forced to pass through a tent. Men
wearing hoods picked out those believed to be Tamil guerrillas or
their sympathizers, and other soldiers searched homes.
   By day's end, hundreds of men and women were taken away from
Trincomalee, according to the government, press reports and a
Western aid worker based in the town. The operation was repeated
over the next few days in each sector of this town of 48,000
people, the government said.
   Since mid-June, government forces and separatist rebels have
fought for control of the north and east, ending a 13-month truce
in the 7-year-old ethnic civil war.
   Few expect an early end to the war for a separate Tamil homeland
in Sri Lanka, the island off India's tip that once was a paradise
noted for tea, spices, beauty and peace.
   Many fear continued conflict will bring chaos. More than 20,000
Tamils have fled to India, which has a Tamil population of about 60
million, since the latest round of hostilities began.
   Fighting has reached a deadlock, with the government controlling
several main towns in the east but the guerrillas in charge of the
north and the jungles.
   Maj. Gen. Gerry de Silva, the regional commander, now says a
political solution is the only way out, a far cry from earlier army
claims that it would quickly eliminate the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam. Government commanders add, however, that negotiations
are possible only from a position of strength.
   A cycle of atrocities against civilians by both sides has
resumed.
   Funerals of young children and mothers have become routine in
Trincomalee. Townspeople fly white flags on their bamboo fences as
if they were surrendering to fate.
   ``We are waiting to die,'' said Gloria Williams, whose small
orphanage in a Methodist church outside Trincomalee was transformed
into a refugee camp for 1,000 old people and children, all Tamils.
   ``All the teen-agers have gone to the jungle to fight,'' she
said. ``I pray to God, but it doesn't help.''
   Tamil rebels are believed to have massacred 600 unarmed
policemen who surrendered when fighting resumed June 11. Reports
say they also killed hundreds of civilians, most of them Moslems,
whom the Tigers accuse of helping the government.
   According to other reports, the government has executed many
Tamil civilians suspected of backing the militants. Masked police
death squads led by members of Tamil splinter groups working for
the government comb major towns on the east coast, picking out
alleged supporters of the Tigers.
   ``The hooded ones came to my house last night,'' Ritah
Sivakamasundary, a 36-year-old Tamil woman, said in a refugee camp
near Trincomalee. ``I heard gunshots after they took my husband
away. I don't know, but I think he's dead.''
   Western diplomats say the government has been the more
restrained of the two sides. ``There are no good guys in Sri Lanka,
but at least the government has made an effort to be disciplined,''
one said, on condition of anonymity.
   He cited the rebels' increasing use of pressure mines that blow
off limbs, a ``particularly inhumane type of weapon.'' The mines,
nicknamed ``dice'' by Sri Lankan troops, have maimed nearly 40
soldiers.
   Sri Lanka is one of Asia's most beautiful countries. Earlier
this year, while the cease-fire held, the International Monetary
Fund said its development prospects were among the region's
brightest.
   With a literacy rate of 90 percent, relatively cheap labor,
liberal economic policies and abundant natural resources, the
island nation of 16 million people was touted as another Singapore.
   Renewed hostilities will increase defense spending 50 percent
this year to $170 million, using up money neded for development. A
projected growth rate of 5.5 percent will not be achieved, and
international bankers say the country will be lucky to beat the
1989 rate of 2.3 percent.
   Foreign investment, which had been picking up after the United
States helped establish a stock market, is expected to lag. The
neglected southern half of the island could become even poorer,
raising the possibility of insurrection on two fronts.
   A Sinhalese nationalist movement centered in the south was
crushed in 1989.
   Its terror campaign and the government's response cost 6,000
lives. The Tamil war has taken nearly 13,000.
   Ethnic tensions between Tamils, who make up 18 percent of the
population, and Sinhalese, a predominant 75 percent, go back
hundreds of years.
   In the teak and ivory drawing rooms of Colombo, the capital,
debate about which ethnic group arrived first harks back to
centuries before Christ.
   In the modern era, trouble began in 1956, eight years after Sri
Lanka gained independence from Britain.
   Tamils dominated Sri Lanka in colonial days. The British gave
them the best jobs and American missionaries set up the best
schools in Jaffna, the Tamil stronghold on the island's northern
tip.
   After independence, the Sinhalese majority voted its men into
power. In 1956, the government made Sinhala the national language
and Buddhism the state religion.
   This angered the Tamils, who have their own language and
practice Hinduism or Christianity. The day the law was passed,
riots broke out nationwide. Hundreds of people were killed.
   The problem simmered, boiled and simmered for 25 years. Sri
Lanka, which entered the 1960s with a higher per capita income than
South Korea or Malaysia, fell behind in the economic race.
   Now the average citizen makes $367 a year, near the bottom in
Asia.
   Ethnic tension turned into civil war in 1983, when 13 Sinhalese
soldiers were blown up by a land mine and Sinhalese rioted in
Colombo, killing scores of Tamils.
   Tamil militants took to the jungles and fought until 1987, when
India arranged a peace agreement and sent thousands of soldiers to
disarm Tamil guerrillas.
   Rebel groups agreed to the accord but the Tigers reneged. Indian
troops spent 32 months fighting the Tigers, then withdrew without
success in March 1990.
   Western diplomats agree the Tigers started the latest violence,
but say they do not understand why.
   After the cease-fire in May 1989, the government gave the Tigers
wide autonomy in the north and east.
   Police were not allowed to make arrests unless the Tigers
approved. The Tigers levied taxes. Army troops were confined to
barracks. The Tigers set up offices and roadblocks throughout the
area and consolidated control.
   One theory says the Tigers, jungle fighters for a decade, could
not adjust to the demands of a democratic political process.
   In the past, they had killed their enemies. With peace, they
were forced to argue with them.
   ``We had been thinking that we could evolve as a nation, but
this situation is terribly demoralizing,'' said Neelan Tiruchelvam,
a moderate Tamil leader. ``We are back to square one.''

   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka _ A 13-year-old monk sat under a tree outside
a temple, reciting legends about Lord Buddha to a few children not
much younger than he.
   It is a common sight in this predominantly Buddhist country,
except that the Sinhalese child-monk, Devamitra, and his disciples
are orphans who lost their parents to ethnic violence that has
ravaged the island since 1983.
   Devamitra remembers the hot July day in 1986 when he and his
elder brother, Wasantha Ekanayake, returned from school to find
their parents dead, riddled with bullets. They were among 46
residents of Morawewa, a village in the northeast, killed by Tamil
separatists.
   The boys hid in the jungle for two days and were found by
Sinhalese soldiers, who took them to the temple in Colombo, the
capital, which operates a rehabilitation center for war orphans.
   Devamitra, named Shantha by his parents, was ordained a year
later, at age 10, because of his religious inclination and now is a
full-fledged monk.
   His second love after the scriptures is soccer, the favorite
sport of many of the 276 orphan boys at the Vajra Sri
Rehabilitation Children's Home.
   A Buddhist monk, Vijira Sri Thero, founded the home in 1983,
declaring that his affection for children compelled him to demolish
some buildings in the temple to accommodate 25 orphans.
   The number of orphans has grown to 326, ranging in age from 5
months to 17 years. They include 50 girls, who live in separate
quarters 10 miles away.
   Six Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, and 24 Moslems are among
the temple's orphans.
   Many of the children lost both parents because of the Tamil
separatist war in the north and east or an ultranationalist
Sinhalese insurgency in the south that was crushed last year. In
other cases, one parent is living but no longer is able to care for
a child.
   ``Mothers and fathers who lost their spouses and now find they
cannot cope with their children bring them here,'' Thero said.
   Ethnic violence began in 1983 when Tamil militants started
fighting for a separate homeland apart from the Sinhalese majority.
Nearly 13,000 people have been killed.
   Separatists claim Tamils, 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people, are discriminated against in jobs and education by the
Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population.
   Officials of the Rehabilitation Ministry say more than 500,000
Sinhalese, Tamils and Moslems fled the northeast at the height of
the Tamil campaign in 1987.
   Colombo and several towns in the east are dotted with refugee
camps that receive government aid to provide living quarters and
monthly allowance.
   Thero's center is run with private donations only. It provides
basic education and teaches the children such vocational skills as
auto mechanics, masonry, carpentry, refrigeration, gem cutting and
foreign languages.
   While Devamitra chose religion as the way out of his nightmare,
a 16-year orphan from the same Sinhalese village wants to become a
soldier.
   ``For the sake of my country, I will join the army,'' said Aruna
Jayasundera, whose parents also were slain in the massacre.

   After several seasons of deserted
beaches and empty hotel rooms, Sri Lanka is attracting tourists
again this year despite a new outbreak of fighting.
   The number of tourists from January to May reached 102,694, a 91
percent increase over the same period of 1989, when two
insurgencies raged.
   A 7-year-old ethnic rebellion by Tamils in the north and east,
and an anti-government revolt last year by ultranationalist
Sinhalese in the south, nearly destroyed tourism.
   Tamil rebels reached an agreement with the government in May
1989 and the Sinhalese movement was crushed, but the Tamils began
fighting again in June of this year.
   Hotels are a barometer of the war.
   ``Going by how our windows are lit up at night, the message is
clear: We are back in business,'' said Gamini Fernando, general
manager of the Colombo Hilton. ``The walk-in guest days are over.
Our guests now need to make a reservation.''
   Occupancy slumped after fighting resumed, ``but not
alarmingly,'' said another hotel executive, who spoke on condition
of anonymity. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed since June, but
warfare has been confined to the north and east, where Tamils
predominate.
   Officials warn tourists not to travel beyond Anuradhapura, an
ancient Sinhalese town 100 miles north of Colombo. About 85 miles
farther north is the Jaffna Peninsula, scene of the fiercest
battles between the army and Tamil Tiger rebels.
   The last good year for tourism in Sri Lanka was in 1982, when
more than 400,000 foreigners visited the island and spent $125.8
million. Last year, the numbers were down to 182,000 and $75.6
million.
   Before fighting resumed in June, Cyril Gardiner, owner of the
126-year-old Galle Face Hotel, had predicted a tourist boom this
winter if the cease-fire continued.
   ``We have turned the bend,'' he said. ``We are back on the
holiday map and the best is yet to come.''
   Winter is the main tourist season in Sri Lanka because its sun
and sand attract people from colder climates.
   Late last year the beaches were known more for bodies floating
ashore than for swimmers and surfers.
   Colombo was under curfew nearly every other day and, when it
wasn't, few residents ventured outside for fear of Sinhalese gunmen
or security forces, who tended to shoot first and ask questions
later.

<HEAD>Telephone Call to Police Brings IRA Death Threat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Williams says he
heard an elderly neighbor screaming ``Don't kill me! Don't kill
me!'' So he called the police.
   His family and his bishop say Williams was trying to be a good
neighbor, but that can be risky in Northern Ireland.
   Williams has been driven into hiding in England and the Irish
Republican Army says he is an informer, who will be killed if he
ever returns.
   Anyone in Williams' neighborhood who sees masked men has only
bad choices: Turn up the television; confront the gunmen; call the
police and risk death as an ``informer''; don't call the police and
risk jail for withholding information.
   ``We're pigs in the middle,'' said Williams' sister-in-law,
Eileen Mahony. ``We have no comeback from anyone.''
   ``I intend to clear his name if it takes me all my life,'' said
Mavis Williams, who urged her 54-year-old husband to flee and is
campaigning publicly to get the IRA death threat lifted.
   ``It's the first time anybody's stood up to them, and the reason
why we're standing up is because it's the truth,'' said her sister,
Mrs. Mahony.
   This family argument with the IRA is not conducted by people
cowering behind locked doors or peeping fearfully through window
blinds. The Mahonys and Williamses, like many of their neighbors,
leave the key in the front door and no one is surprised to find a
neighbor or stranger coming or going.
   The family's defense is not that Michael Williams had a right
and duty to call the police. They say he made a mistake, an honest
mistake, in not recognizing an IRA operation.
   ``In Ireland, to inform is the worst possible crime anyone can
commit; it's worse than a murder, worse than a rape,'' said Eileen
Mahony's husband, Jim. ``So to call him an informer, they're taking
his honor away.''
   Mrs. Williams is 51, born and raised in Londonderry, and said
she would not have called the police. She would have gone next door
to see what was happening and stayed with her neighbor until it was
over, she said.
   When her husband told her what he had done, Mrs. Williams said,
``I just went to pieces.''
   Williams was born in London and settled in Northern Ireland
after their marriage 31 years ago.
   The Williamses raised 12 children in the Creggan Estate, a Roman
Catholic neighborhood, through the Catholic civil rights marches of
the late 1960s, the street warfare of 1969 and the early 1970s, the
British army patrols and house searches, and IRA hijackings of
homes and cars.
   Despite all that, his wife said, Williams didn't understand what
was happening that afternoon, March 1.
   At 2:45 p.m., Williams saw two men in stocking caps enter Rose
Garnon's house, his wife said. Later, he heard Mrs. Garnon
screaming and, since the Williamses do not have a telephone, went
to another neighbor's home to call the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
   Mrs. Williams said 45 minutes passed before the arrival of
police, who have to anticipate that a call for help may be an
invitation to an ambush.
   As it turned out, the IRA men went to the house to hijack a car
and hold Mrs. Garnon hostage until the end of whatever operation
was planned.
   It was a costly afternoon for the IRA. Police confiscated a
handgun, a rifle, an RPG7 rocket launcher and several grenades.
   The IRA demanded an explanation and Williams agreed to a
meeting, he told The Sunday Times of London. He was taken to a
house and told to sit facing the wall.
   Williams sensed the room filling behind him, he said, ``but
there were no threats. On the contrary, they told me that, if I was
threatened or my children had hassle, I had only to contact them.''
   He assumed he was cleared, but on March 9, police seized more
IRA weapons in Creggan. Mrs. Williams, fearing the IRA would blame
her husband, insisted he run away.
   On March 13, four masked men called at the Williams home, where
they confronted 16-year-old Robert Williams and two sisters, aged 8
and 10.
   Mrs. Williams said her son was told: ``Tell your mother: If your
father comes back he will be executed.''
   The family tried to settle things through Sinn Fein, the IRA's
legal political wing, but negotiations came to nothing and Mrs.
Williams took her case to the Derry Journal, the local newspaper.
   ``I think a lot of people might be frightened to confront the
IRA on their own patch,'' Bishop Edward Daly said. ``I think the
Williams family perhaps is somewhat exceptional in that regard.''
   Daly has contacted journalists about the case, but thinks that,
in the short run, publicity may only make the gunmen dig in their
heels.
   ``Ultimately, I think what will change their attitude will be
the community, and I think very large numbers of people now in the
community are asking very large questions about this and feeling
that it is wrong,'' the bishop said.
   Creggan is a stronghold of Sinn Fein and the IRA in a city whose
very name symbolizes the feud between Protestants, who call it
Londonderry, and Roman Catholics, who use the old name, Derry.
   Even here, Sinn Fein ran second in last year's local elections
to the Social Democratic and Labor Party, which shares the IRA's
goal of a united Ireland but rejects its violent methods.
   Martin McGuinness, the local Sinn Fein leader, said the clerics
and Social Democratic politicians supporting Williams were, in
effect, ``suggesting that nationalists should give information'' to
the police.
   After Williams called police, he encountered Mrs. Garnon's son,
Clifford, and one of his friends. They said Williams told them of
the call and urged them not to tell Sinn Fein.
   Hugh Brady, a city councilor from Sinn Fein, has said the story
told by those two men disputed Williams' claim that he didn't know
it was an IRA operation.
   Brady now refuses to discuss the case. ``I've said everything I
intend to say,'' he declared in a short telephone conversation.
   On April 20, Clifford Garnon was found drowned in the Foyle
River, an apparent suicide. Mrs. Garnon also refuses to discuss the
case.
   Daly has protested IRA tactics that make accomplices of
neighbors. He said many people in Creggan feared their homes would
be taken over for ambushes or their cars commandeered to ferry
bombs or guns.
   ``It's the great nightmare here,'' he said.
   In August 1988, a Creggan man who hadn't seen his neighbor for
days broke into the man's apartment to investigate. He accidentally
set off an IRA bomb intended for security forces. It killed him and
another neighbor.
   Mavis Williams and Eileen Mahony share cigarettes and pots of
tea as they talk their problem out in a sort of duet:
   Mrs. Mahony: ``Children have been terrorized. There've been
elderly people ...''
   Mrs. Williams: ``... have been terrorized ...''
   ``... you know, with a gun put to your head. It's no joke .. .''
   ``They take your car ...''
   ``You're told not to report it ...''
   ``If you don't report it, and the police find out the car was
used, you're taken in ...''
   ``and you're questioned ...''
   ``and you're charged ...''
   ``for withholding information.''

<HEAD>Litmus! Litmus! Why is Everyone Talking About a Color Test?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The password is litmus.
   That's the test nobody is supposed to give David H. Souter. And
it is likely to wind up as his shield against question A: whether
he'd say yes or no on abortion rights.
   To ask directly would be to apply the litmus test shunned by
President Bush and most Democrats. Only the most ardent of abortion
rights activists argue that a Supreme Court nominee can properly be
required to say how he would rule on an issue certain to confront
him on the bench.
   So Souter will be asked obliquely, as a Democratic senator put
it.
   Litmus is the compound that turns red in acid solutions; the
test of the same name is one in which a single standard determines
the outcome.
   ``. . . There was no single issue, no litmus test or standard
dominating my decision to nominate,'' Bush said, campaigning in
Philadelphia a day after choosing Souter, a New Hampshire jurist
with a nearly blank slate on abortion cases. ``And I will add,
there should be no litmus test in the process of confirmation.''
   The White House began issuing such injunctions even before Bush
chose his nominee, to fend off the question of whether he would
name anyone who did not agree with his view that the abortion
rights decision of 1973 should be reversed.
   Souter himself was quoted by his friend, Sen. Warren B. Rudman,
R-N.H., as saying he wouldn't have been interested in his
appointment as a federal appeals judge earlier this year, or in the
Supreme Court, if the administration had any litmus tests to apply.
   Rudman said nobody should ask a nominee how he would rule on
specific cases, that it would violate judicial ethics to answer
such questions, and make confirmation proceedings into a political
popularity contest.
   In that view of the way the Senate should Supreme Court
nominees, the issues questions should be general, about a nominee's
judicial philosophy, view of the Constitution and its guarantees _
not about specifics.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said Souter won't be asked directly
about things he might be ruling on from the bench. ``But I think
obliquely you do that,'' he said, by asking about his views on the
right to privacy, underpinning of the 1973 decision legalizing
abortion.
   That route to the A word has been used before.
   Robert H. Bork, whose nomination was rejected by the Senate in
1987, said a constitutional right to privacy was invented by the
court, which then used it to invent a right to abortion. There
never was any doubt about his opposition to the abortion ruling, or
his stance on a catalogue of other issues.
   Bork had spoken, written and ruled on them, which armed his
critics with confirmation questions about positions he had taken
for years.
   ``It is amusing that some senators claimed that the White House
imposed a litmus test for the president's nominees,'' Bork wrote
later. ``No one in the administration asked me a single question
about my views on any topic of law. They were satisfied that they
knew my approach to judging.''
   He said the litmus came at the Senate hearings, where ``by
contrast, various senators not only asked my views, but insisted
that I adopt what they thought the correct position.''
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who finally got the seat Bork was
denied, said at his confirmation hearing that his personal view on
abortion was irrelevant, and that he wasn't going to signal how he
might rule on any specific case. He did call privacy a
constitutionally protected right.
   He is now aligned with what has so far been the four-justice
minority that favors reversing the 1973 abortion decision.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said at her 1981 confirmation
hearing that while she found abortion personally abhorrent, she
would deal with the issue on the basis of the facts and the
Constitution.
   When she was pressed on that and on other specifics, she replied
with a carefully prepared counter to litmus testing:
   ``I do not believe that, as a nominee, I can tell you how I
might vote on a particular issue which may come before the court,
or endorse or criticize specific Supreme Court decisions presenting
issues which may well come before the court again. To do so would
mean I have prejudged the matter . . . ''
   In a 1989 ruling, she joined the 5-to-4 majority giving states
new power to limit abortions, but stopped short of providing a
fifth vote to overturn the basic abortion rights ruling.
   With the retirement of William J. Brennan Jr., the court is
evenly divided on that question and Souter's position is crucial.
Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., said Souter would not be confirmed if
the Senate knew or believed it would mean reversal of the abortion
decision.
   Souter hasn't said, and won't. He's as litmus-proof a nominee as
Bush could find.

<HEAD>Supermarkets Concentrate on Convenience Foods, Produce Shelves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Convenience foods and produce shelves are among
the biggest attractions for supermarket shoppers, perhaps showing
that while consumers want to put dinner on the table with ease,
they are trying to eat well.
   Baby boomers with babies are eating at home more, and that gives
supermarkets an opportunity to provide takeout food to compete with
restaurants, Timothy M. Hammonds, senior vice president of the
non-profit trade group the Food Marketing Institute, said at the
organization's seminar earlier this month.
   Research shows that these parents are saying they no longer have
time to eat in restaurants. ``Not cooking is becoming a substitute
for eating out,'' he said.
   ``If you think about the supermarket, we really started 50 years
ago as an outlet for manufacturers and farmers. Now we are the
purchasing agent for the consumer,'' Hammonds said. Today's
supermarkets carry an average of 25,855 items apiece, according to
FMI.
   Consumers are becoming increasingly interested in convenience.
And, according to Hammonds, convenience foods don't come wrapped in
all the guilt they once did, leaving consumers feeling that they
were not doing all they should to provide good meals.
   ``That's why the cake mix people had you add that egg,'' to ease
the feelings of guilt for not making the cake from scratch, he
said. Now, however, convenience carries another meaning. It ``lets
you spend more time with your family.''
   Still, none of this has hurt the sale of produce. Fruit,
Hammonds speculated, is considered ``nature's convenience food.''
And consumers still are taking time for vegetables.
   In its annual survey of consumers, FMI found that 46 percent of
those surveyed buy takeout food at fast-food restaurants, 27 perent
at other restaurants and 14 percent at supermarkets. However, that
number has increased steadily since 1987, when 9 percent of
shoppers said they bought takeout food at supermarkets.
   Food labeling, a big issue in Washington these days as changes
are proposed to current regulations, is less of an issue with
consumers. Just 36 percent said they always read beyond the
expiration date to the nutrition and ingredient information, though
an additional 45 percent to 48 percent said they sometimes read
those labels.
   Manufacturers' health claims on labels were considered very
believable by 8 percent of those surveyed but somewhat believable
by 52 percent. The most often-cited reason for skepticism was that
the labels don't tell the whole story.
   ``Only 8 percent said current health claims are very believable.
There's a problem out there, folks,'' Hammonds said.
   FMI's survey, taken annually for two decades, questioned 1,005
primary shoppers in a household.
   The survey also found that 65 percent of those questioned said
their diets could be at least somewhat healthier. Fifty-seven
percent of shoppers said they eat more fruits and vegetables than a
year ago; 34 percent are eating less meat; 27 percent eat less fat.
Only 16 percent said they eat more fiber, and 18 percent said they
eat more fish.
   Still, taste ranked first among factors influencing supermarket
purchases, rated very important by 88 percent of those surveyed.
Nutrition was cited by 75 percent and product safety by 71 percent.

<HEAD>Lyme Disease Vaccine for Dogs Unveiled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dog vaccine against Lyme disease has
been approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and should be
on the market this summer, officials of a veterinary medicine
manufacturer said.
   Officials said a vaccine for humans is not imminent.
   ``Unfortunately, a lot of research would be needed before a
vaccine could be approved for human consumption,'' said Michael
Gregoricka, a veterinary medicine researcher at Fort Dodge
Laboratories, which is manufacturing the dog vaccine.
   Lyme disease is transmitted by the bite of the deer tick, a tiny
creature found on deer, mice, birds and other animals in woods or
fields. It can cause arthritis, lethargy, heart disorders and other
symptoms in animals and humans. It is treated with antibiotics.
   The disease was identified in the United States in 1975, and
cases have been found in 44 states.
   The vaccine was developed by researchers at the University of
Minnesota. Fort Dodge Laboratories bought marketing rights to the
drug and engaged in four years of testing on dogs, Gregoricka said.
   Gregoricka said the vaccine must be approved by individual state
veterinary officials. Vaccines for other animals are being studied,
he said.
   Researchers believe dogs and other animals can spread Lyme
disease to people, and Fort Dodge officials said development of the
animal vaccine is a step in curbing the disease.

   Tampa and Oakland, Calif., have been picked
as tentative test sites for a study of how people use water in
their homes and how much they could save if they installed
high-tech plumbing devices.
   Researchers plan to attach monitors to toilets, shower heads and
water meters at a sampling of homes in both cities.
   ``The information will enable us to project future demand and
allow us to make realistic projections on how much water we can
save through conservation,'' said Wendy Nero, conservation manager
at the Tampa Water Department.
   The Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J., will
conduct the research, pending approval by the Tampa and Oakland
city councils. If approved, the study should begin by January.
   Researchers also will study whether people using devices like
low-flow shower heads really save water _ or just take longer
showers, said civil engineer Thomas Konen, the study's coordinator.
   To make sure the study includes a cross-section, officials will
pick households based on income levels, geography and household
types, Nero said.
   Data collected in the homes will be transmitted via telephone
lines to researchers in New Jersey every night.

<HEAD>Scientist Finds New Evidence for Giant Quakes in Pacific Northwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM McCALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Old mud dumped on the sea floor by giant
underwater landslides provides new evidence that 13 devastating
earthquakes may have rocked the Pacific Northwest during the last
6,900 years.
   The study by John Adams of the Geological Survey of Canada also
suggests there is a 2 percent to 10 percent chance that a quake
measuring 8 or more on the Richter scale will shake the region
within the next 50 years.
   Several previous studies furnished evidence that at least six
great earthquakes jolted the coasts of Oregon and Washington during
the past several thousand years, although no such quake has
happened since pioneers settled the region.
   Adams' study, scheduled for publication in the August issue of
the journal Tectonics, revealed a new line of evidence that the
Northwest is prone to giant earthquakes. It also found geologic
signs of 13 such quakes.
   Adams studied sea floor sediments called turbidites, or layers
of mud.
   Rivers carry mud and other debris into the ocean, where it
settles on the continental shelf and on the slope leading down to
the deep sea floor. The mud accumulates until the slope becomes too
steep, collapsing in a sudden undersea landslide called a turbidity
current.
   This current carries the mud into undersea channels or canyons,
where it settles to form turbidite deposits.
   Adams identified 13 layers of the turbidite muds in each of
several undersea channels. The remarkable discovery was that each
layer was deposited simultaneously in all the channels. That is,
for example, the sixth layer in one channel was deposited at the
same time as the sixth layer in the other channels.
   That indicated each layer was created by a great earthquake,
which shook the sea floor so intensely it triggered huge undersea
landslides up and down the Oregon-Washington coast, he said.
   ``It would have to be substantial to shake loose that much
sediment,'' Adams said in a telephone interview from Ottawa.
   The 13 layers correspond to 13 great earthquakes, which occurred
an average of every 590 years, give or take 170 years, he said.
Based on the frequency and evidence strongly indicating the most
recent big jolt happened 300 years ago, Adams estimated the
Northwest is 2 percent to 10 percent likely to have another such
quake within 50 years.
   Adams' study was based on reanalysis of core samples of sea
floor sediments collected from 1965 to 1968 by La Verne Kulm and
other researchers at Oregon State University.
   He was able to date and correlate the turbidite layers in the
various channels because they all were deposited after the eruption
of the Mount Mazama volcano in Oregon's Cascade Range, 6,800 to
6,900 years ago. The eruption is best known for creating the crater
now named Crater Lake, but it also spewed volcanic glass, formed by
the very rapid cooling of molten lava, that was carried to sea and
deposited on the ocean floor.
   Adams' study adds to other evidence that the Northwest has been
rocked by powerful quakes, said Brian Atwater, a U.S. Geological
Survey geophysicist who uncovered some of the first evidence for
such prehistoric seismic disasters.
   But Atwater and Kulm said another possible explanation for
Adams' findings is that sediment perched on the continental shelf
merely breaks loose at regular intervals after big storms or when
enough has accumulated to trigger an undersea landslide.
   ``You can get that kind of regularity by loading sediment on the
ocean shelf,'' Kulm said, noting that turbidity currents happen
every 10 to 25 years near the mouth of the Mississippi River in the
Gulf of Mexico.
   But he said sediments accumulate more rapidly there than off the
Northwest coast, and that 400- to 600-year intervals between
turbidity currents is ``a pretty long time'' if the landslides were
triggered by slope collapse rather than big earthquakes.
   So ``earthquakes are most certainly a strong possibility'' to
explain the turbidites off Oregon and Washington, Kulm said.
   Atwater said that early this century, the great Grand Banks
earthquake off Newfoundland's coast sent debris crashing down the
undersea channels of the Atlantic to snap telephone cables.
   Adams said it is possible that simple sediment accumulation or
even major storms could have triggered the turbidity currents. But
the range and frequency indicate the most likely cause is a major
earthquake, he said.
   Atwater unearthed some of the first evidence of prehistoric
great quakes in the Northwest several years ago. He found that
estuaries such as Washington's Willapa Bay and Oregon's Netarts Bay
contained alternating layers of peat covered by sand. That
indicated repeated instances in which the coastline dropped
vertically in a great quake, then was inundated by tsunamis, or
giant sea waves, that dumped sand on coastal marshes.
   David Yamaguchi, a University of Colorado scientist, has found
evidence in tree rings that trees along 60 miles of the Washington
coast died suddenly 300 years ago when they were submerged by a
tsunami.
   Adams' study ``certainly complements the estuary evidence and
the tree ring studies,'' Atwater said.

   On a barren windswept plain, Kerry
Sieh digs trenches across the San Andreas Fault, trying to unravel
the secrets of prehistoric earthquakes so he can forecast disasters.
   Here, in the shadow of the Temblor Range, 130 miles northwest of
Los Angeles, Sieh spends hundreds of hours 15 feet underground.
Using a tape measure, fine-point pencil and laptop drawing board,
he makes detailed maps of beds of sediment in the walls of his
trenches.
   ``I expose layers that go back hundreds or thousands of years,
and I see where the San Andreas Fault has broken those sediments,''
said Sieh, a 39-year-old geologist at the California Institute of
Technology.
   ``By dating those sediments with radiocarbon methods, I can tell
when prehistoric earthquakes occurred. That helps me understand
what is likely to happen in the future.''
   Over the past 15 years, Sieh's meticulous research helped alert
millions of Southern Californians to a horrible secret once hidden
in the Earth:
   Within the next few decades, there is at least a 60 percent
chance that the region will be rocked by the Big One, a disastrous
quake measuring 7.5 to 8 or more on the Richter scale.
   Scientists know the last such disaster _ the Fort Tejon
earthquake _ shook a sparsely populated Southern California in
1857, decades before a similar jolt at the northern end of the San
Andreas ravaged San Francisco in 1906.
   Before Sieh's pioneering studies of the southern San Andreas, no
one knew how often great earthquakes shook Southern California. So
people had no idea when another such quake might be expected.
   ``His work certainly has had a major impact on our view of the
probability of major earthquakes in Southern California,'' said
Robert Wallace, retired chief scientist of the U.S. Geological
Survey's Office of Earthquake Studies. ``His work drove the policy
of the Los Angeles area toward real serious planning for a major
earthquake.''
   Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson credited Sieh's findings
for ``triggering many of the measures we've undertaken as far as
public preparedness is concerned.'' He cited a 1981 ordinance
requiring reinforcement or demolition of thousands of vulnerable
brick buildings.
   California is quake-prone because it straddles two great plates
that make up Earth's crust. Quakes happen as the Pacific plate
grinds slowly northwest past the North American plate along the
700-mile-long San Andreas and a network of related faults.
   The entire fault doesn't snap at once. Because of changes in
rock type or bends in the fault, separate segments of the San
Andreas break alone or in combination to cause quakes.
   Three segments that extend 200 miles ruptured to cause the 1857
Fort Tejon earthquake. From northwest to southeast, they were the
Cholame segment in central California, the Carrizo Plain segment
and the Mojave segment, which extends from Tejon Pass north of Los
Angeles to Cajon Pass north of San Bernardino.
   As a geology student at the University of California, Riverside,
in the early 1970s, Sieh theorized that by digging trenches across
various segments of the fault, he could determine how often great
quakes had ruptured each section. The method, known as
paleoseismology, let him estimate how soon big jolts might happen
again.
   He showed seismologists they could learn something from
geologists, who study rocks and sediments instead of seismographic
records of recent quakes.
   ``The whole idea that we can talk about probabilities of future
earthquakes happened because of Kerry's work,'' said Lucile Jones,
a seismologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. ``His work is so
fundamental it has changed the field.''
   In the mid-1970s, Sieh's work indicated there was a 50 percent
to 90 percent chance a great quake would shake Southern California
within 50 years. Later research by Sieh and others prompted a
formal forecast in 1988 by the Geological Survey, which said there
was at least a 60 percent chance of such a disaster within 30 years.
   Sieh's early research indicated the next Big One would rupture
the fault's Mojave segment, the segment closest to Los Angeles. A
1980 federal report estimated such a quake could kill up to 14,000
people, hospitalize 55,000 and cause $17 billion in damage.
   But Sieh's more recent findings suggest the Big One is most
likely to rupture the San Andreas Fault's Coachella Valley segment,
between the Palm Springs area and the Salton Sea.
   Because such a quake would be more distant from Los Angeles,
damage likely would be less than envisioned in the 1980 estimate _
unless the fault continued to rupture northward, breaking both the
Coachella Valley and Mojave segments.
   On the Carrizo Plain, the most recent findings by Sieh and USGS
scientist Carol Prentice indicate that segment of the fault is
unlikely to break soon in an exact repeat of the great quake of
1857.
   While Sieh's continuing studies changed details about the likely
location of Southern California's next Big One, his work provided
``hard-and-fast proof'' it is inevitable, author John Nance wrote
in the 1988 book ``On Shaky Ground.''
   ``No longer could residents or government officials of Southern
California treat the prospect of great earthquakes on the southern
San Andreas as the mere armchair postulations of theorizing
scientists,'' Nance said.
   Sieh said that when he digs into the mighty San Andreas, he
doesn't think about the catastrophes it ultimately will unleash.
   ``I do what I do because it's fun,'' he said. ``But I enjoy
doing something that helps other people.
   ``So often what people do in response to earthquake hazards is
stick their heads in the sand. We need to do whatever we can to
reduce the property losses and to reduce losses of life. If I can
say roughly when and where earthquakes are going to happen, I'd
hope people would be responsible and rational enough to deal with
it.''

   Iben Browning holds dozens of patents
in several specialties, but it's his earthquake projections that
are stirring up notoriety he says he'd rather do without.
   Browning said at a conference in Missouri last year there was a
high probability of an earthquake along the New Madrid Fault this
Dec. 2.
   He was deluged by calls.
   He insists he did not predict an earthquake.
   ``The public always wants everything in black and white,''
Browning said.
   ``No one can tell you there is going to be an earthquake on Dec.
2, no one can know that. ... Everybody knows when he drives a car
that he's taking a risk that it will malfunction or crash. Yet
people do drive cars. They're dealing in probabilities.''
   Browning, 72, a large man with a graying burr haircut, says the
public does not understand _ and the press does not know how to
communicate _ the idea of probability.
   ``The closest you can translate probability into English is
`maybe.' But unless you say `maybe not,' they take it as an
absolute,'' he said.
   Browning is chief scientist for Summa Medical Corp., an
Albuquerque biotechnology research and development company. His
Summa resume says he holds 66 U.S. and foreign patents in optics,
electronics, mechanics, chemistry, electro-optics, hydraulics and
educational toys.
   Summa credits him _ he won't discuss what he does for the
company _ with developing new technology for compressing
electronically transmitted human speech.
   Over the years, he's been a development physicist with American
Optical Co., worked in optics for Bell Aircraft Corp. and was a
scientist for Sandia National Laboratories.
   But gradually his interest in climatology grew, and he now
publishes the Browning Newslettter on world climate. He said he's
been accepted commercially as a climatologist since 1974 when he
became a consultant for Paine Webber Inc.
   His formal training was elsewhere: a bachelor's degree in math
and physics from Southwest Texas State University, and a master's
degree in bacteriology physiology and a doctorate in physiology,
genetics and bacteriology from the University of Texas at Austin.
   ``It turned out that in my observations of climate that all of
the soft tools with which I approached biology were applicable to
climate,'' he said. ``It's a subject that is comparable in
complexity to biology.''
   Business needs climate information because the weather
determines how much food will be produced and where, whether the
transportation industry can get over the roads, whether anything
can be built, he said.
   He provided forecasts for the 1989 edition of the Rocky Mountain
Almanac and ``did as well or better than the Old Farmers' Almanac
predictions,'' said Lee Olson, almanac editor.
   ``He did predict the usual monsoons that come up in Arizona in
late August, that the Colorado Great Plains would receive extra
moisture and store up adequate moisture for the 1990 year,'' Olson
said. ``He had the ski season only partly. He had it right for an
early start, but it got dry around Christmas as I recall and his
timing was a little off on that.''
   Browning said his climatological observations are based on high
tidal forces, produced by four causes: the proximity of the moon to
Earth; the proximity of Earth to the sun; the alignment of the
Earth, moon and sun during the full moon and new moon; and the more
perfect alignment of those bodies during eclipses. The vector sum
would be the total tidal force produced.
   Such forces can trigger earthquakes, he said, and on Dec. 2,
there will be the highest vector sum high tidal force in 60 years
from 30 to 60 degrees north latitude. That area includes the New
Madrid Fault, running roughly from Marked Tree, Ark., through New
Madrid, Mo., to Cairo, Ill.
   Since last year, when Browning raised the possibility of a
December New Madrid quake, the Arkansas National Guard has
scheduled earthquake exercises for around that time, one Arkansas
school district is considering canceling classes and sales of
earthquake insurance have picked up.
   But Browning said whether a given fault is actually triggered
would depend on the pressure built up along it. That information
should come from area seismologists, he said firmly.
   If no earthquake occurs in or around December, Browning said
people will be more inclined to ignore the danger of the New Madrid
Fault.
   ``That's what I fear more than anything else,'' he said.
``People don't trust authorities anymore; they never did trust them
much. Why should they? What have authorities done for them except
tax them to death?''
   Browning's earthquake projections are controversial among
seismologists.
   Klaus Jacob, senior research scientist at Lamont-Doherty
Geological Observatory of Columbia University in Palisades, N.Y.,
said correlating earthquakes to tidal forces doesn't work.
   ``It's more likely that in the next 10 years or 20 years we'll
have something (quake activity), rather than on this particular
day,'' Jacob said. ``You see, earthquakes don't care about
predictions. And people shouldn't worry about predictions. They
should worry about earthquakes.''
   Browning said he told a convention of chief executive officers
in San Francisco on Oct. 10, 1989, that there was a 50-50 chance of
an earthquake registering 7 on the Richter scale on or about Oct.
16 because a high triggering force was expected that date and
geologists had determined there was a strain on the San Andreas
Fault.
   An earthquake registering 7.1 hit Oct. 17, killing 67 people.
   Jacob said: ``He was just lucky. That's the law of large
numbers.''
   Arch Johnston, director of the Center for Earthquake Research
and Information at Memphis State University in Tennessee, said
Browning ``is certainly not justified scientifically.''
   ``The tidal force that Dr. Browning bases his theory on has been
examined thoroughly by seismologists, and there's no evidence that
tidal forces can trigger earthquakes. ... Earthquakes depend on the
internal processes of the Earth, not the external processes of the
sun and moon.''

<HEAD>More Competition Ups Ante in Fight for Federal Science Aid</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The government's research and development
programs, a $64 billion source of technological breakthroughs and
national pride, are also a vulnerable target for budget-cutters.
This is the third in an occasional series examining one portion of
this year's federal budget _ science spending.

   The two companies competing to build $1
billion worth of bus-sized magnets for the superconducting super
collider both have promised to manufacture them in the home state
of a key senator.
   The National Science Foundation, a government agency hoping to
expand its budget, treated five congressional staffers to a tour of
U.S. research stations in Antarctica. And the private National
Foundation for Ileitis and Colitis got the actress Mary Ann Mobley
to beseech a congressional committee to boost spending on the
digestive diseases.
   It's all part of the increasingly intense competition for
federal research and development dollars. Though the kitty will
reach $64 billion this year _ of a $1.2 trillion overall budget _
scientists say it is too small.
   Federal science spending is feeling pressure from within and
without. The huge federal deficit means there is less money for all
government programs, including science.
   There also are demands on the government's science dollar from a
growing number of big-ticket projects like the $8 billion super
collider, an atom smasher to be built in Texas, and the $30 billion
space station. Thus, researchers are vying ever harder to persuade
Congress to give them a piece of the budget pie.
   ``There is a lot of money out there, but these sums are
considerably less than is needed to do the job and the competition
is greater,'' said Jerold Roschwalb, lobbyist for the National
Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges, whose
schools rely heavily on federal research aid.
   The situation has driven some scientists to venture into
Congress' budget process as never before.
   Recently, two groups _ the American Society for Cell Biology and
the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology _ hired
former Maine Democratic Rep. Peter Kyros for about $100,000 to
lobby Congress to increase federal medical research grants.
   ``Our members felt the situation had gotten so bad that it was
time for something new and innovative,'' said Peter Farnham,
spokesman for the biochemistry society. ``All of our members live
and die on the availability of these grants.''
   Other scientific organizations have long believed that getting
active in the budget process is a must. About 20 colleges and
universities have lobbying offices in Washington, while dozens of
others have retained lobbying firms.
   John Farrar, president of the Digestive Disease National
Coalition, testified before the House and Senate Appropriations
committees for five years before showing up this year with Mobley,
an actress who has battled her own digestive ailments.
   ``The fact is nobody knows'' what his appearances accomplish,
Farrar said. ``But it seems to me if you don't show up, you know
you won't get your share.''
   Dangling jobs is another approach.
   Last summer, General Dynamics announced that if the Department
of Energy picked it to build giant magnets for the super collider,
it would manufacture them in Hammond, La.
   Its competitor, Grumman Corp., said in May of this year that it
would build the magnets in Shreveport, La., if it won the
competition.
   Executives for both contractors cited the proximity of the
Louisiana sites to Waxahachie, Texas, where the atom smasher is to
be built. They also cited supplies of skilled workers.
   But the firms also had positioned themselves to deliver hundreds
of jobs to Sen. J. Bennett Johnston's home state. The Louisiana
Democrat is chairman of the Senate's Appropriations energy and
water subcommittee and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
Both panels play crucial rules in providing money for the super
collider.
   ``I guess it didn't hurt,'' General Dynamics spokesman Jack
Isabel said of the relation between the company's decision to
locate in Louisiana and the fact that it is Johnston's state.
   ``That's not a factor,'' said Grumman spokeswoman Miriam L.
Reid, adding, ``We certainly are aware of Senator Johnston.''
   Another way to draw attention to a project is to bring
decision-makers out to the lab _ all expenses paid.
   Last December, the National Science Foundation _ one of 96
federal agencies and agency subdivisions involved in science _ did
what it does every year: It invited congressional staffers to visit
federal bases in Antarctica.
   Five aides accepted, all from Congress' budget and
appropriations committees. They were flown commercially to New
Zealand and carried to Antarctica on a scheduled cargo run by a
foundation-owned C-130 aircraft. There, they spent four days being
ferried by helicopter to research facilities.
   The cost to taxpayers was about $27,000, according to figures
provided by Joel Widder, the foundation's head of congressional
affairs. The benefit far exceeds that, he said.
   ``We've instilled in them a never-to-be-forgotten experience,''
Widder said. ``The next time a member turns to staff and says, `Why
should we support this?', that staffer has been there.''
   Competitors for federal science dollars do battle in two
legislative arenas. One is the budget resolution, which makes
recommendations for broad areas of spending such as health, defense
and environment. While not binding, the blueprint is an important
statement of priorities that frequently is heeded later in the
budget process.
   The second target is the 13 annual appropriations bills, which
actually provide the money for government. Each bill finances one
or more agencies, and federal science spending is spread among nine
of the measures.
   In 1988 _ the most recent year for which the National Science
Foundation has figures _ the government distributed science funds
to 2,769 colleges and universities, 46 academic system offices such
as state university headquarters, and 717 non-profit, independent
institutions like hospitals.
   There also are 218,000 scientists and engineers on the
government payroll and many of them are additionally eligible for
federal grants. And the foundation says that last year, there were
41,270 companies involved in high technology, many of which sought
government contracts.
   With that kind of competition, ``you've just got to get in there
and market yourself,'' said Cleon Arrington, vice president for
research at Georgia State University.

   One advertisement depicted a portion of the
globe with only stars and the blackness of space where the United
States should be and asked, ``Where would America be without basic
research?''
   Another showed a close-up of the Statue of Liberty and
proclaimed, ``This has never been a statue of limitations.'' A
third pictured only a horseshoe magnet and announced, ``It takes
more than luck to build superconducting magnets.''
   The ads _ full-color and full-page _ have run about 20 times
over the last two years in a pair of publications that circulate to
many of the nation's policy makers. All three tout the
superconducting super collider, the $8 billion government atom
smasher planned for Waxahachie, Texas.
   But only one ad _ the one with the horseshoe magnet _ provides
more than a mention of the sponsor, General Dynamics. The ad
campaign shows how a large corporation can fight for a share of the
federal science budget.
   The St. Louis-based defense contractor is hot after a contract
from the Department of Energy to build at least some of the 12,000
superconducting magnets the super collider will need. These magnets
_ each about 50 feet long _ will guide protons to high-speed
collisions in the giant accelerator so scientists can study
nature's building blocks.
   The Energy Department says the overall worth of the magnet
contract will be more than $1 billion.
   But General Dynamics knows Congress first has to agree that the
super collider should be built. And that's a top priority at
General Dynamics' office in suburban Arlington, Va., where the 100
employees include six registered lobbyists.
   ``You're not goig to sell your magnets without the project,''
Alvin Spivak, Washington spokesman for the company, said recently.
   While Congress considers whether to provide $318 million for the
super collider, as President Bush requested in his fiscal 1991
budget, General Dynamics is keeping its name in circulation through
the ad campaign.
   Company spokesman Fred Bettinger in San Diego said the ads cost
about $80,000 _ more than many small companies, universities and
other groups can afford to spend in pursuit of federal science aid.
   Two of the ads mentioned General Dynamics only at the bottom of
the copy: ``General Dynamics _ A Strong Company for A Strong
Country.''
   Only the horseshoe magnet ads touted the company's own
attributes: 14 years of building superconducting magnets for other
particle accelerators. ``General Dynamics is ready to join the team
that will build America's most powerful research tool,'' it said.
   The ads were taken out in Roll Call, a twice-a-week newspaper
that covers Congress, and The National Journal, a weekly magazine
that features in-depth articles on issues and personalities in
Washington. Both publications boast readerships that include large
numbers of lawmakers, legislative aides and agency officials.

   Eastern Airlines and several top managers were
charged with falsifying safety and maintenance records in New York
and Atlanta in a scheme that allegedly allowed unsafe planes to fly.
   The 60-count criminal indictment cited tampering with log books,
work cards and computerized maintenance records at John F. Kennedy
International and La Guardia airports in New York, Hartsfied
International Airport in Atlanta and Eastern headquarters in Miami.
   The federal charges capped a 10-month investigation and plea
bargain talks that collapsed when Eastern refused to admit to a

   The nation's privately run savings
institutions lost $271 million in the first three months of this
year, a worse showing than in the same period a year ago but a
sharp improvement over the previous quarter.
   The Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision said
Wednesday the red ink compared with a $3.1 billion loss in the
fourth quarter of 1989 and a $10 million profit in the first
quarter of 1989.
   The figures do not include 350 thrifts which were still open at
the end of March but were controlled by the Resolution Trust Corp.,
a new agency charged with closing and selling failed S&amp;Ls.

   The savings and loan crisis should not deter
Congress from permitting commercial banks to venture into the
insurance and securities industries, Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady said.
   The thrift industry was deregulated without requiring S&amp;L owners
to risk more of their own money, Brady told the Senate Banking
Committee Wednesday. Consequently, any expansion of bank powers
ought to be linked to strong capital requirements, he said.

comments critical of the move.
   The change is a one-year pilot program, with the Big Board

   OPEC ministers began preliminary talks aimed at
raising the price of crude oil worldwide and soothing Iraqi anger
over cartel members exceeding production quotas.
   The ministers, who start formal meetings Thursday, appeared
willing to bring the price per barrel to at least $20. The current
price is $18.

   A shock a day seems to send quivers through the
world of business and economics of late, and the surprising thing
about it is that none of them should be a shock at all.
   The White House announcement that the budget deficit might be
bigger than anticipated was almost in the nature of things _ it has
happened just about every year in the past 20, but it was widely
referred to as a shock.
   ``It should have come as no surprise to anyone,'' said economist
William Dunkelberg, ``except for recent arrivals from Mars.''
   Similarly, presidents have a long tradition of promising to keep
a rein on taxes, but few succeed. Still, millions were surprised
when President Bush reversed himself and said he might consider a
tax increase.
   Judging by the reaction of stock market analysts, one of the
most violent shocks in recent weeks was the slide in corporate
profits, although that slide has been underway for well over a
year, and extensively documented.
   Perhaps equally or even more shocking is that the evidence of a
downturn was ignored by so many people who claim to have a deep
understanding of corporate finances. Did their hopes suffocate
their intellect? Perhaps.
   There even remains some residual dismay about the downturn of
building and real estate in some parts of the country, although
there has never been a time this century when these areas of the
economy were not subject to cycles.
   The economy and its parts oscillate. Seldom do they draw a
straight line up or down for very long, and one of the more
pronounced up-down cycles is in real estate. It's there to be seen
in the charts and graphs.
   Equally pronounced are cycles in securities markets, but you'd
never have guessed it from the public display of shock when stocks
took a dive on Monday, July 23. The real shock was that so many
should have been shocked.
   Consider some of the evidence that investor expectations might
have been stronger than profits:
   _Various statistical indicators had for months shown the
disparity: price- to-earnings ratios, stock yields in relation to
bond yields, dividend yields.
   _Earnings improvements had crested more than a year ago.
   _Various companies were issuing notices that earnings might be
worse than anticipated.
   You may be sure, too, that there will be expressions of shock if
the economy as a whole falls into recession, but that's the lesson
of history. To experience eight years of expansion, as now, is a
rare experience in America.
   Inevitably, economies disrupt themselves; their own actions,
mainly their excesses, undermine their health. Excesses such as
overly large inventories, waste, overhiring, sloppy management,
poor workmanship.
   If these don't bring an end to expansion, then poor fiscal
policy, such as excessive taxes or spending, or unwise monetary
policy, such as overly tight money, might accomplish the deed.
   Whatever the cause, the economy eventually needs to take a rest,
rid itself of excesses, regroup. It must lay low before expanding
again, and during that time people who should know better will say
it is down for the count.
   That's the way it has been and most likely that's the way it
will continue for a while more.

   Tandy Corp.'s newest home computer has joined
the ranks of Hoover vaccuum cleaners and Del Monte canned fruit in
earning the Good Housekeeping seal of approval.
   The Tandy 1000 RL, which was unveiled Wednesday and is available
at more than 7,000 Radio Shack stores nationwide, incorporated
dozens of tasks families said they performed most frequently, like
compiling a grocery list, balancing a checkbook, taking messages
and charting expenses.
   The computer, the first to be sanctioned by Good Housekeeping
magazine, contains 30 recipes from the New Good Housekeeping
Cookbook and can instantly alter recipes to vary the number of
servings.
   The introduction of the 1000 RL comes a month after IBM
introduced a relatively low-priced home machine, also designed for
people who are not well versed in complicated computer technology.
   The 1000 RL, which Tandy recommends be placed in the kitchen,
also provides access to toll-free phone numbers for many airlines
and hotel chains and can link the user to other information
services such as Prodigy and CompuServe.
   ``It can become a central point in any home,'' said Howard
Elias, Tandy's vice president of computer marketing, while
demonstrating the machine at a press conference in a Manhattan
penthouse.
   The Tandy systems are priced as low as $749.90, but accessories
like a mouse and modem are extra. A color monitor with mouse,
modem, clock and expanded memory runs about $1,199.70. The
comparable IBM PS-1 system costs about $2,105.
   But the question remains whether consumers will accept the 1000
RL as an essential home appliance or merely dismiss it as a flashy
entertainment center.
   ``Will this create a new habit?'' said Barry Bosak, an analyst
with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. ``You have to leave that
open-ended right now.''
   Currently about 20 million homes have computers, but experts
suspect many of those machines are used for work taken home from
the office rather than to help the consumer with household chores.
   ``The home market has not been exploited because it has been
difficult to define,'' Bosak said. ``The office market has been
much easier to define, and, of course, the dollars were there to
spend.''
   But Tandy Chairman and Chief Executive John V. Roach insists the
tide is changing. ``The VCR boom absorbed a lot of disposable
income, but that has abated, and now there is a heightened interest
in home computers.''
   He credited the latest introduction from IBM with helping to
stir up interest in the home product category. And Apple Computer
Corp., maker of the Macintosh line, is believed to be working on a
lower-priced home computer for introduction this fall.
   Tandy's Elias said the home computer market has become the
fastest growing segment in the industry, posting annual gains of 10
percent to 17 percent. Comparatively, the office computer market is
expanding at a pace of between 5 percent and 10 percent a year.
   The 1000 RL has the ``potential to significantly increase unit
sales in the desk-top area over the next six months,'' Roach said.
   The machine is designed to be left on at all times. The screen
goes dark if the machine is not used for a specified number of
minutes, but pages reappear at the touch of a key. And since it has
no fan, the machine is silent.
   The PC-compatible 1000 RL is so easy to use that Tandy,
traditionally viewed as the leader in the home computer market, is
guaranteeing consumers can figure it out in about 15 minutes. ``We
will work with you until we give up on you,'' Roach said.
   The 1000 RL is visually appealing. Tiny illustrated thumbtacks
hold notes for family members on a computer ``bulletin board,'' and
a diary, which can be accessed with a secret password, is
illustrated as a book with lock and key. The machine also can
produce pie charts detailing just what percentage of a consumer's
monthly expenses went to pay utility bills.
   Tandy officials said the company is considering marketing the
1000 RL software package to be used on other machines.

   Twelve-year-old Megan Leef and her fellow
summer campers aren't spending their time weaving baskets or
shooting hoops _ they're watching the ticker tape.
   The 40 youngsters at the Money Management Camp for Young People
at Loyola College are not necessarily junior tycoons. They are
spending the week away from home to learn about earning money,
saving it, and spending it wisely.
   They had barely said goodbye to their parents Monday when the
Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 100 points in 90
minutes as they watched the action at a brokerage house.
   But it didn't dampen their enthusiasm.
   ``I like what I already know about money. When I am a teen-ager,
I'll be able to manage money instead of wasting it. I already
wasted it today. I bought a New Kids on the Block key chain,'' said
Megan, who will be in eighth grade at Bethesda's Westland
Intermediate School in the fall.
   For the campers, games and swimming took a back seat to sessions
on ethics, entrepreneurship, checking accounts and credit cards. A
session on buying car insurance was a topic close to their hearts.
   Most of the campers know one thing about money _ they don't have
much of it.
   ``I wanted to learn how to manage money because there's a great
need to know the value of money when you have money, and not just
throw it away,'' said 13-year-old Jeffrey Barzyk, who is entering
eighth grade at Loyola Blakefield High School in suburban Baltimore
County.
   Therese Steen, assistant director of continuing education in the
Sellinger School of Business and Management at Loyola, is the head
counselor.
   ``There is a great need for business education even for this age
group, and this can be a fun aspect of their education,'' Steen
said.
   ``Compound interest, what is a security, the difference between
being smart and being an inside trader. ... There is a great
concern about the misuse of credit in our society,'' Steen said.
``They will learn that credit helps businesses and new homeowners,
if you don't abuse it.''
   The campers are students from the Baltimore-Washington area and
from Philadelphia who are ahead of their peers in math or English.
   The camp appears to be unique.
   ``This is the first I've heard of a camp of that nature for that
age group,'' said Doug Barber, executive vice president of Future
Business Leaders of America, a Washington-based organization for
high school and college students.
   Jim Stone, a professor at the University of Minnesota and a
researcher in a national study that looks at how schools relate
class work to the world of work, said some schools offer programs
on career options, but few students participate.
   ``The summer camp idea is a little different, but exciting,''
Stone said. ``Even though it's only a one-week shot, it offers the
opportunity to become more aware than what they would normally see
in the course of a day.''

<HEAD>Last of Berkshire Town's Big Textile Mills to Close</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ADAMS, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last of the big, brick textile mills
that once dominated this little town in the Berkshires is scheduled
to close next spring, putting nearly 400 people out of work.
   ``This is a tremendous loss,'' said Mark Pasquini, executive
director of the Northern Berkshire Industrial Park and Development
after company officials announced they were closing the Waverly
Fabrics mill and shifting its operations to South Carolina and
Delaware.
   Last fall, officials of New York-based F. Schumacher &amp; Co.,
which owns Waverly, announced they planned to cut back the Adams
operation to a regional distribution and custom sewing center
employing about 230 workers.
   But on Tuesday, James Hinthorn, vice president of human
resources for F. Schumacher, announced the entire Adams operation
would be phased out by April 1991, except for a retail outlet store.
   ``Our concept of a regional distribution center and regional
customer workroom was predicated on sales continuing to grow
rapidly,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, sales in the Northeast are
substantially below what we had anticipated and that made it very
difficult from a business standpoint to justify continuing
operations.''
   For decades, Waverly has been known for fine fabrics for home
furnishings. The Adams plant produces draperies, bed covers,
curtains and pillows.
   Its future in this community of 9,000 people has been uncertain
since the Arnold Print Works, a dyeing plant that had been one of
its main suppliers, shut down in 1984, despite state efforts to
save it. The two plants had together employed more than 1,000
people.
   The sprawling Waverly plant was once part of the massive
four-mill Berkshire Cotton Manufacturing Co. complex that employed
3,000 people at the turn of the century. In 1910, when the mills
were booming, they swelled the population of the town to 13,106
people, a figure never since equalled.
   But in the 1930s the company was sold to Berkshire Hathaway and
by the 1950s the last of its operations here had left for the South.
   Waverly and the state Department of Employment and Training set
up a workers assistance center last month to help workers cope with
the layoffs the company announced last fall.
   ``We'll have to find new jobs, we have no choice. But where?''
said Norma Sebastino. She has worked at the plant for 18 years and
her husband for 28 years.
   ``My husband is 61. Where is he going to start? I'm 53, where am
I going to start?'' she said. ``We've got a home. We've got
children.''

<HEAD>SEC Okays Big Board Circuit Breaker on Index Arbitrage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators approved a rule that will
allow a ``circuit breaker'' to limit index arbitrage on the New
York Stock Exchange when the Dow Jones industrial average rises or
falls 50 points.
   The change was approved unanimously by the Securities and
Exchange Commission although all four commissioners expressed
misgivings about the 50-point threshhold.
   The change is a one-year pilot program, with the Big Board
required to give the SEC a progress report after six months.
   The proposal, actually an amendment to an existing NYSE rule,
would limit index arbitrage to selling at or above the previous
lowest price when the Dow Jones average is down 50 points. I would
also limit buying at or below the previous highest price when the
average is above 50 points.
   Index arbitrage is a computerized trading strategy through which
traders try to take advantage of small price differences between
the stock and futures markets by simultaneously buying large orders
in one market while selling in the other.
   Critics have blamed program trading, particularly index
arbitrage, for worsening market drops like the 1987 stock market
crash, the 190-point drop last Oct. 13 and Monday's 100-point fall.
   Monday's drop triggered ``circuit breakers'' which prompted
brief trading halts on futures markets at the Chicago Board of
Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   The NYSE first proposed an index arbitrage circuit breaker last
February.
   In a written statement issued after the SEC vote, the Big Board
said the rule change would minimize excess market volatility that
might be due to index arbitrage. The move should promote market
stabilization and enhance investor confidence, the exchange said.
   Under the rule change, when the Dow Jones average goes below 50
points or more from the previous day's close, index arbitrage
orders to sell any stock listed in the S&amp;P 500 stock price index
can only be executed when the price is at or above the previous
lowest price.
   Conversely, when the Dow rises 50 or more points, buy orders can
only be executed when the price is at or below the previous highest
price.
   SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden said he was voting for the rule
change ``although I am unhappy with some of the aspects of this.''
   Breeden said he's rather cure the disease instead of just
treating it. For him, the disease is the low level of margins in
the futures markets. Margins are the downpayments or collateral
paid by investors who buy securities or futures contracts on
credit. Currently, futures margins are set by the exchanges,
usually only a fraction of the amount required in securities
transactions.
   Breeden has been lobbying Congress to have authority for stock
index futures and their margins transferred to the SEC.
   ``I have substantial doubts whether 50 points is the right
trigger,'' said Commissioner Phil Lochner.
   ``The staff has that concern as does, obviously, a number of
commissioners,'' Richard Ketchum, head of the SEC's Division of
Market Regulation, after the vote. ``Fifty points triggers a
reasonable number of times in a year. And there is a worry about
any artificial impediments to trading at that level.''
   ``On the other hand, trading on Monday was a pretty good
indication that where the stock prices really picked up speed,
where the slope of the decline increased was around 50 points. And
where the futures price diverged from the stock price also was
around 50 points,'' added Ketchum, who called 50 points ``a
reasonable indicator.''

<HEAD>Conde Nast Closes Woman Magazine, Woman's Day Auction Ends Without
Sale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a pair of developments reflecting difficult
times in the magazine business, Woman magazine is being closed and
Woman's Day has been taken off the auction block for lack of an
acceptable bid.
   Conde Nast Publications Inc. said Wednesday it would close Woman
magazine after its September issue.
   Woman is the first Conde Nast magazine to cease publication
since the Newhouse family took control of the company in 1959.
Woman has been published for 10 years but was acquired by Conde
Nast about 18 months ago.
   Separately, France's Hachette SA said it no longer plans to sell
Woman's Day magazine, saying it was dissatisfied with the bids it
received over the past two months and now will invest in improving
it.
   Both Woman's Day and Woman have had double-digit declines in
advertising pages for the first six months of the year amid an
industrywide ad slump.
   Consumer magazine ad pages were off 3.3 percent industrywide in
the first half of the year compared with the January-to-June period
in 1989, with traditionally heavy magazine advertisers such as
automotive and tobacco companies making major cutbacks in the
spending.
   Magazine industry analyst Martin S. Walker said the two latest
developments show ``the market has really decided that there is no
longterm future in broadly-based women service magaines.''
   He said the audience for such magazines is aging rapidly and
that younger women appear to prefer more contemporary approaches.
   Conde Nast spent heavily over the past 18 months on Woman,
improving the color and graphics, hiring top writers, getting space
at the checkout stands and boosting circulation to nearly 600,000,
publisher Rebecca Darwin.
   But in a statement, Conde Nast Chairman S.I. Newhouse Jr. said
``the magazine did not develop as we hoped it would.''
   Newhouse was said to be unavailable for further comment, but Ms.
Darwin said the magazine had been up for sale for several weeks and
no serious bidders emerged. ``The feeling was that in this market
it might take a long time to sell and the economics of it were that
he felt it was best to cease publication,'' she said. The magazine
was believed to be losing money.
   Conde Nast publishes 13 magazines including Vanity Fair, Vogue,
Glamour, GQ, Gourmet and Mademoiselle.
   Hachette put Woman's Day up for sale in mid-May, saying it would
enable the company's U.S. operation to trim its debt while focusing
its attention on creating or acquiring special interest
publications with international appeal.
   Along with Woman's DAy, a monthly magazine that claims current
circulation of 4.6 million, Hachette had planned to sell the 21
Woman's Day Specials that appear periodically.
   ``The bids we received on Woman's Day did not reflect the true
worth of this very valuable franchise,'' said Peter Diamandis,
president and chief executive of Hachette's Diamandis
Communications Inc.
   ``It is not in the best interests of the magazine or the company
to sell,'' he said in a statement. Hachette now plans to invest in
the magazine.
   The company never disclosed what minimum price it wanted for the
magazine, which had an operating profit of more than $25 million
last year.
   Didier Guerin, president of Hachette Publications Inc., which
oversees Diamandis Communications, declined to say how many bids
were received or who the bidders were. But the bidders reportedly
included Britain's Robert Maxwell, Reader's Digest Association Inc.
and Macfadden Holdings Inc., a partner in the National Enquirer
tabloid.
   He said Hachette Publications had wanted to reduce its debt but
was under no immediate pressure to do so. Most of the company's
unspecified debt resulted from Hachette's $712 million purchase of
the CBS magazine group from CBS Inc. in 1988.
   Hachette Publications owns 18 magazines, including Road &amp; Track,
Flying, Boating, Car and Driver, Elle and Memories. Guerin said all
but two or three are profitable and that the company would now
``examine all the options'' for those that are unprofitable.
   He said Memories, an 18-month-old magazine that re-examines
major stories years after they have happened, is one of the
magazines being examined for possible sale. But he cautioned that a
decision on whether to sell it has not been made.

   Government subsidies that assure farmers
certain income and the nation a predictable food supply are holding
fast as Congress moves toward completion of the 1990 farm bill.
   After vigorous debate, the House on Wednesday defeated, 263-169,
a proposal by Reps. Richard Armey, R-Texas, and Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., to strip subsidies from farmers with adjusted gross incomes
of $100,000 or more. It would have affected about 20,000 farm
operations.
   Members of the Agriculture Committee persuaded colleagues to
stick with the panel's intention to support huge and small farmers
alike as a means of controlling the food supply.
   The House planned to complete debate and pass its version of the
approximately $55 billion, five-year bill on Friday. The Senate was
resuming debate today.
   ``I honestly was surprised,'' Agriculture Committee Chairman
Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, said of the vote on the Armey-Schumer
amendment. ``I was feeling a much closer vote.''
   He said environmental and labor organizations were helping his
side.
   ``If you drive farmers out of the program, you take acres out of
the program that you will not be able to keep environmentally
sound,'' de la Garza said.
   As for organized labor, he said, ``I think their interest is
jobs. Like I tell my friends in the UAW (United Auto Workers) in
Detroit: no farmer, no pickup.''
   Armey said he and his supporters knew they were underdogs before
the vote. ``We wanted to shape the debate with the interests of
consumers, taxpayers and small farmers in mind, and we were
successful in that regard,'' he said.
   Urban lawmakers said they did not understand why the wealthiest
farmers could not be cut free when aid to the poor was consistently
being reduced.
   Armey said the amendment would have saved $900 million annually
from the approximately $10 billion a year the bill foresees
spending to support wheat, corn, cotton, soybeans and rice.
   ``These people are not the family farmer,'' said Schumer. Their
income from the farm is only 4 percent of their income.
   ``Yes, they are the large agricultural businesses that don't
need subsidies. ... the investors and the multimillionaires who
farm for a hobby. ... They are investors who live far away and
don't even till the soil.
   Rep. Edward Madigan of Illinois, the ranking Republican on the
Agriculture Committee, argued that the Schumer-Armey amendment
would cost the taxpayers more than the program in the bill.
   It would take farmers out of control of the government, enabling
them to put more land into production and cause surpluses that
would drive prices down, Madigan said. Farmers still in the program
would get high deficiency payments from the government if prices
went too low, he said.
   Besides establishing price support programs for commodities, the
farm bill sets policy for nutrition programs, agricultural exports,
soil and water conservation, agricultural research and extension
work, food inspection and other responsibilities of the Agriculture
Department.
   In other action Wednesday, both the House and Senate fended off
attacks on the peanut program, one of the most protectionist
programs in agriculture.
   A Senate amendment that would have ended quotas, removed all
restrictions on the planting of peanuts and authorized the
secretary of agriculture to establish a new price support for the
crop was defeated, 57-41.
   The House ruled an identical amendment out of order after Rep.
Charles Hatcher, D-Ga., cited a Congressional Budget Office
estimate that the amendment would cost the taxpayers $55 million
next year.
   The House also:
   _Accepted an amendment, 256-164, that would require the
agriculture secretary to start a management program for dairy
products if surpluses reached 6 billion pounds, instead of the 7
billion pounds originally in the bill.
   _Approved an amendment on voice vote to gradually lower supports
on wool and mohair from $200,000 per producer in 1991 to $100,000
in 1994.
   The Senate, meanwhile, rejected, 72-26, an effort to tie target
prices to the Consumer Price Index minus 4.3 percent.

<HEAD>Union Asks NLRB Help In Getting Greyhound Drivers Back Behind
Wheel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union attorneys have asked for federal help in
forcing Greyhound Lines Inc. to reinstate immediately its 6,300
striking bus drivers.
   In a letter to the National Labor Relations Board, the
Amalgamated Transit Union says pending court battles against
Greyhound will take too long to resolve and even if the union wins,
members could be left with no jobs and no money.
   NLRB spokesman David Parker said Wednesday the agency had not
received the letter and would not comment on the request. NLRB
General Counsel Jerry Hunter already has obtained an injunction
against the union barring it from further violent acts in the
dispute.
   ``The striking employees' resources are now depleted, and their
health care and homes are at risk,'' the letter from union attorney
Martin J. Burns said.
   The request is the latest move by the union, whose drivers went
on strike March 2 in a dispute over wages and job security.
Dallas-based Greyhound, which operates the only nationwide bus
system, has continued running at reduced levels since the strike
began.
   The union cites the company's financial troubles in asking the
NLRB to seek an injunction requiring the reinstatement.
   Greyhound filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection from
creditors on June 4, citing increased expenses from fighting the
initially violent strike.
   In addition the NLRB's Hunter said Greyhound had committed an
unfair labor practice by immediately instituting a new contract on
March 2 when no impasse existed in negotiations.
   Greyhound maintains an impasse did exist and is challenging the
finding in hearings before an administrative law judge in
Minneapolis. If the company loses, it could be forced to reinstate
the 6,300 striking drivers and give them back pay from the time the
strike began.
   Hearings aren't scheduled to begin on the dispute until
mid-September, however, and could drag on through the courts for
years.
   ``Meanwhile, the employees who have exercised their ... rights
will be confronted with financial ruin,'' Burns said.
   The ATU says the potential back pay is accumulating at between
$3 million and $4 million a week, and the burden of such a claim
would insure Greyhound's financial failure and leave the drivers
with no jobs and no money, even if they eventually win.
   ``Greyhound's refusal to reinstate the striking employees denies
them and the union of statutorily protected rights now which can
never be fully vindicated,'' Burns said. ``The board's and the
union's interests can be served with a simple injunction directing
Greyhound to reinstate striking drivers under terms and conditions
that existed prior to Greyhound's unfair labor practice.''
   Greyhound spokesman George Gravley did not comment on the
request. He said the company was preparing for the Minneapolis
trial.

   A partnership seeking control of National
Intergroup Inc. has enough votes to fill three seats on a 10-member
board of directors, keeping NII's own candidates out, according to
the partners and the company's chairman.
   ``Our tally shows that we don't have enough votes to elect our
directors,'' Chief Executive Officer Howard M. Love said at a news
conference Wednesday after the holding company's annual
shareholders' meeting in Pittsburgh.
   About 200 NII stockholders and proxies attended the meeting to
elect three new directors. Candidate slates were nominated by the
company and the dissident group, Centaur Partners of New York,
NII's largest stockholder with 16.5 percent of outstanding shares.
   Centaur principals Melvyn J. Estrin and Abbey J. Butler said
they believed stockholder support for them was overwhelming but
would not say how many votes they thought they had. ``It is not a
slight victory, not a slight win,'' Butler said.
   If Centaur's candidates are elected as expected, the shareholder
group will have three seats on a board of 10. Estrin said he
believed the seven directors already seated would respond to the
arguments of the three new members.
   ``We do think that the shareholder vote is a mandate,'' Estrin
added. They said board nominees el in Vichy after viewing director Claude
Berri's new film ``Uranus.''

<HEAD>Stotler Group Plansd to Close its Main Subsidiary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stotler Group Inc. has announced that it will
shut down its principal subsidiary, once a giant among the nation's
commodity brokerages.
   Stotler, headed by Chicago Board of trade Chairman Karsten
Mahlmann, said in a news release Wednesday that subsidiary Stotler
and Co. ``determined that it is in its and its customers' best
interests to wind down its commodity futures brokerage business in
an orderly manner over the coming days.''
   The announcement came at the same time that Chicago-based
Stotler Group reported that it had failed to meet about a $750,000
obligation on its short-term loans and faces $7.6 million in
additional obligations maturing or otherwise coming due in the next
30 days, including a $1.1 million interest payment.
   Stotler officials did not return telephone calls seeking further
comment on the company's plans. Mahlmann was in meetings Wednesday
and a spokesman said he was unavailable for comment.
   On Tuesday, Stotler lost its top-rank trading status on all
futures exchanges and faced a struggle for survival after a
proposed bailout of its parent company collapsed.
   Stotler Group announced the tentative bailout offer _ reportedly
$10 million from a Taiwanese party _ last week. But the deal was
subject to approval from the investor's board of directors, ``which
approval was not obtained,'' Stotler said.
   As a result, ``Stotler Group's debt obligations must immediately
be financed or restructured,'' the company said.
   The publicly owned Stotler Group also said it was considering
selling some of its subsidiaries or assets to meet its debt
obligations.
   Stotler and Co. is the Stotler Group's principal subsidiary.
Stotler also owns R.G. Dickinson &amp; Co., a futures brokerage in Des
Moines, Iowa.
   Mahlmann is Stotler's managing partner, but has not run the
firm's day-to-day operations for more than year. He is better known
as chairman of the Board of Trade, the world's oldest and largest
futures exchange.
   Stotler officials have not discussed publicly the reasons for
the firm's financial problems. They are believed to stem in part
from a recent rapid expansion, including the opening of new
domestic branch offices and joint ventures with South American and
European partners.
   Stotler, an old-line brokerage with roots in the grain business,
once was one of the nation's 10 largest commodity brokerage firms,
controlling nearly $300 million in customer funds.

<HEAD>UAW: Chrysler Setting Poor Tone for Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp.'s chief negotiator
has set a tone for talks with the United Auto Workers that will
make it tough to agree to a contract this summer, a union official
says.
   ``The attitude of Chrysler management is far more arrogant than
it is for the other two'' automakers, UAW Vice President Stan
Marshall, head of the union's Chrysler Department, said Wednesday.
   ``That sets a tone right off. I did not like the opening session
by a long ways... And I'm sure that will carry on through,'' he
said.
   Marshall specifically criticized Chrysler's labor Vice President
Anthony St. John for broadly outlining to the media three concepts
the company wanted to pursue at the talks.
   They included some form of an employee ownership plan, a
plant-by-plant reward system linked to productivity and a
multi-employer health-care trust plan designed to cut rising costs.
   Marshall said talking about the issues with the media before
discussing them with the UAW bargaining team made a ``mockery'' out
of the negotiation process.
   Chrysler issued a statement Wednesday afternoon through
spokesman Tom Houston saying:
   ``It is very important that all Chrysler's constituents be aware
of the very difficult situation the company faces. We put our
concerns before the union in a general context and will be spelling
out the details as negotiations unfold.
   ``The UAW is a respected partner and it is our hope that they
will work with us toward a successful conclusion to these
negotiations.''
   Since before the talks began last week at General Motors Corp.,
Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler, there has been speculation that there
may be a break in a tradition of pattern bargaining, or arriving at
a contract at one automaker and then more or less imposing it on
the other two.
   When negotiations opened with Chrysler last Friday, UAW
President Owen Bieber said flatly that the union was basing its
bargaining strategy on the pattern tradition.
   Ford has far fewer employees on layoff status than does Chrysler
and is not planning on closing any plants. Chrysler plans to stop
production at its St. Louis car plant a week after UAW contracts
with each of the Big Three expire Sept. 14.
   The negotiations involve about 450,000 UAW-covered employees at
the Big Three, about 60,000 of them at Chrysler.
   Marshall said Chrysler is not in nearly the same financial
health as are Ford and GM. Chrysler, which reports second-quarter
earnings next week, has said it made $71 million in the first
quarter, an 80 percent drop from that period last year. Ford and GM
earnings dropped in the first quarter, but not as steeply as
Chrysler's.

Canadian-led investment group for $3 billion.
   However, the buyer will make only a 10 percent down payment, and
borrow the rest from Columbia with the bonds themselves as
security. That means taxpayers could still wind up holding the
bonds if there is a default and the thrift is seized.
   The price is $68 million more than the bonds' value on
Columbia's books as last reported publicly, but the gain is too
little to offset its insolvency.
   Last year's thrift bailout legislation forced Columbia to write
down the value of its junk bonds by $1 billion. It was $215 million
in the red at last report, as of March 31, and needs hundreds of
millions of dollars beyond that to avoid the possibility of seizure
by regulators.
   Columbia's former chief, Thomas Spiegel, was accused this month
of squandering $19 million on various ventures, some in partnership
with his friend and financial ally, junk bond pioneer Michael
Milken. Spiegel angrily denied the charges, which regulators made
in a civil lawsuit.
   Most of Columbia's bonds were sold by Milken to Spiegel, who was
paid $9 million in 1985, the highest amount ever for a thrift
manager.
   Not sold Wednesday was another unusual investment, a package of
private equity securities that Columbia has estimated could be sold
at a profit of up to $200 million.
   ``We have reason to believe that sale of those could bring us
back to a positive capital position,'' Columbia Chief Executive
Edward G. Harshfield said in a telephone interview.
   Asked if Columbia can avoid seizure by regulators, Harshfield
said: ``I still think we've got a fighting chance here.''
   The buyer of the junk bonds is a partnership assembled by Gordon
Investment Corp., a merchant bank based in New York and Toronto.
Gordon America L.P. will pay $300 million down and give Columbia a
note for the remaining $2.7 billion at a 10.5 percent interest rate.
   ``The contract that we executed today with Columbia Savings and
Loan reflects our view that the portfolio represents attractive
investment values over the long term,'' Thomas I.A. Allen, a
partner in Gordon Investment Corp., said in a statement.
   The twist in the deal is that the junk bond package itself will
serve as security. That means the insolvent Columbia _ or taxpayers
if the thrift is seized _ could wind up holding the junk bonds
again if Gordon America defaults.
   In its statement, Columbia acknowledged Gordon America paid a
premium for the bonds. And Harshfield acknowledged that the thrift
might wind up with the bonds again.
   But, he said, ``In the meantime, we put $300 million between the
taxpayer and the bondholder.''
   Regulators allowed Columbia to continue operating even though it
was insolvent while its managers tried to find a buyer for the junk
bonds.
   As part of last year's savings and loan bailout, thrifts were
forced to sell their junk bonds. That coincided with a steep
decline in the value of the securities, catching thrifts with big
junk bond portfolios in a double bind.

<HEAD>Reports: Securities Companies Investigated In Wake of Black Monday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 10 Japanese securities companies are
being investigated for allegedly compensating favored customers for
16 billion yen, or $107 million, in losses following the 1987 stock
market crash, major Japanese newspapers reported Thursday.
   The reports, which came out in the early afternoon Thursday,
appeared to have an immediate impact on Tokyo currency and stock
markets, stimulating a fall in both the yen and in share prices.
   Yamaichi Securities Co., Daiwa Securities Co. and about 10 other
brokerage firms were said to have compensated favored clients after
the Oct. 20 crash, in which the benchmark Nikkei Stock Average fell
14.9 percent, the largest daily fall on the Tokyo exchange.
   The reports were attributed to an investigation by the Tokyo Tax
Administration, which refused to comment.
   The securities companies allegedly sold warrants, convertible
bonds and other market instruments at bargain prices to special
institutional and individual clients who later sold them back to
the brokers at market rates for a profit, the reports said.
   The companies then recorded the sums used for repurchasing the
bonds as losses and deducted them from their taxes in fiscal 1987.
   The reports said that the Tokyo Tax Administration has been
reviewing such transactions and planned to assess the companies a
total of 7 billion yen, or $46.6 million, in additional taxes.
   The administration reportedly views such writeoffs as
contributions or entertainment fees which are therefore taxable,
they said.
   Among the companies named, Yamaichi Securities was said to have
compensated clients for the largest amount of losses of up to 8
billion yen, or $53.3 million.
   In a statement, Masazumi Konichi, a senior Yamaichi official,
said tax authorities had already completed their review of Yamaichi
financil proceedings during 1987.
   ``We understand that all bond transactions that took place
during that time were fair transactions. There is no truth in the
reports of loss compensation,'' he said.
   The release of the report, which appeared in the evening edition
of each of Japan's major national newspapers, had a major impact on
Tokyo financial markets.
   The dollar closed higher at 150.11 yen, up 0.98 yen from
Wednesday's finish of 149.13 yen. On the stock market, the Nikkei
Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 331.52 points, or 1.05
percent, closing at 31,369.75.
   ``The news of made many market players lose confidence,'' said
Yozo Asai, an analyst with Yamaichi.

<HEAD>Cult Leader Seeks Ties With Miami's Mainstream</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The menu included white wine, pasta salad and _ for
some _ the first taste of Yahweh ben Yahweh.
   ``Egypt has her pyramids. India has her Taj Mahal. France has
her Eiffel Tower,'' the self-proclaimed son of God told business
leaders and politicians. ``Miami has the son of Yahweh. The world's
greatest attraction is in your midst...I'm here.''
   Yahweh's lunch appearance before the elite Manatee Bay Club in
May was full of self-glorifying rhetoric, his trademark since
arriving in Miami 11 years ago. But it also signified another
important step in his strategy to win acceptance among business and
political power brokers.
   At times, the 54-year-old former Hulon Mitchell Jr. sounds more
like a Rotary Club booster than leader of a white-robed sect under
federal investigation for alleged crimes that could include
extortion and the murder of ``blasphemers.''
   Yahweh ben Yahweh boasts of his estimated $8 million in
meticulously renovated real estate, including motels, a recording
studio and a new supermarket. He speaks passionately about
improving blighted neighorhoods and using capitalism to help
impoverished blacks.
   He's hobnobbed with developers, city commissioners and Mayor
Xavier Suarez. Followers have abandoned their six-foot wooden
staffs for briefcases and are encouraged to learn a little Japanese
to help business.
   Yahweh ben Yahweh is just as committed to denying allegations
against his Temple of Love Inc., subject of a federal grand jury
probe. He calls detractors jealous, spiteful and drug-addicted. He
calls himself the ``prince of peace.''
   ``You know well that good is going to overcome evil,'' said
Yahweh at a recent interview in his attorney's office. ``That's
what `Star Wars' is all about.''
   The story of Yahweh ben Yahweh could also be movie material.
   Drought and depression were strangling Oklahoma in October 1937
when Hulon and Pearl Olive Mitchell had the first of 13 children.
The son, named after his father, grew up in the black section of
Enid, Okla.
   The Mitchell children sang in the choir of their father's
Pentecostal church. One, Leona Mitchell, would become a soprano
with New York's Metropolitan Opera.
   Mitchell Jr. married at 19 and studied psychology at Phillips
University in Enid. After a divorce, he moved to Atlanta and earned
a master's degree in economics at Atlanta University. A second
marriage ended in separation.
   In Atlanta, he began to preach interpretations of the Bible
under the name Father Michel.
   He moved to Miami's Liberty City section in 1979 claiming to be
the messiah of a lost black tribe of Israel. His turban is held by
a gold pin bearing his name in Hebrew _ ``God, the son of God.''
   In the early 1980s, Yahweh and followers mostly confined
themselves to Miami's black neighborhoods seeking money and
converts. They began to acquire both.
   They also began to establish a militant reputation. In 1986,
tenants of an apartment building north of Miami resisted eviction
after the sect purchased it. There were scuffles, shouting matches
and slayings.
   A former Yahweh member, Robert Rozier, pleaded guilty to killing
two tenants and two other slayings. He was sentenced to 22 years in
prison and is helping federal prosecutors investigate the sect.
   Last year, a federal judge in Miami awarded 27 tenants more than
$1.5 million for wrongful eviction and blasted the Yahwehs for a
``terrorist occupation strategy.'' Thomas Equels, an attorney for
the tenants, said two wrongful death suits were settled for about
$500,000.
   Yahweh ben Yahweh testified in court he had no role in the
violence. He has not been charged.
   Since the apartment incident and other allegations of
Yahweh-related harassment, Yahweh ben Yahweh has worked diligently
to recast the group's image.
   He's backed away from fist-pounding messages about white
oppression and retribution against ``blasphemers.'' He says he was
speaking figuratively about toppling white-dominated industries
when he told followers to bring him ``the head of a white man.''
   He cultivates ties with political leaders, black and white, and
belongs to mainstream business groups, including the Greater Miami
Chamber of Commerce and the American Hotel Motel Association.
   ``The focus is always on my detractors, on negativity,'' he
said. ``They may focus for two seconds on a physical building or
something that I've swept out of the ghetto. And they ignore how
I've brought this building alive without drugs, without crime...For
all around that building is still full of crime, drugs, alcholism,
fights and destruction.''
   The Yahwehs' work has not gone completely unheralded.
   Three years ago, the Miami's Urban League chapter gave Yahweh
ben Yahweh its highest honor, the Whitney M. Young Humanitarian
Award, named for the league's national president during the '60s.
   ``Yahweh ben Yahweh demonstrates that you can take depressed
properties and turn them around,'' said Urban League T. Willard
Fair, president of the Urban League of Greater Miami. ``He's an
inspiration to the entire community.''
   ``You have very few mainstream religious groups willing to
invest in the community like the Yahwehs,'' said Newell Daughtrey,
director of the Business Assistance Center, a development group
focusing on black neighborhoods. ``I don't know where there money
comes from. I don't know why someone would follow him. All I know
is what I observe. And all I've seen has been good economically.''
   Yahweh ben Yahweh denies he requires disciples to surrender
their money, but declined to give details on the group's finances
or membership. Yahweh followers approached on the streets refused
to discuss their faith or finances.
   State records show the Temple of Love is incorporated as a
non-profit company. But Yahweh ben Yahweh is not among the
executives listed with the Secretary of State's office.
   The sect also tightly regulates contact with its leader.
Interviews with him are videotaped. He claims a metal detector at
the Temple of Love is used to screen guns and other ``weapons made
of man.''
   ``My people are good. There is nothing to hide,'' he said. ``I
teach my people to drive 29 in a 30 mile-per-hour zone.''
   A federal grand jury is looking into whether Yahweh and close
aides in the Temple of Love ran a criminal enterprise from 1981 to
1986. Press reports suggest the probe includes allegations of
extortion, arson and murder.
   But Ellis Rubin, attorney for Yahweh ben Yahweh, says the grand
jury proceedings are secret and any details ``would just be an
educated guess.''
   Rozier, now under the federal witness protection program, is the
principal informant, said Rubin. The U.S. Attorneys Office in Miami
refused to comment.
   Yahweh says he is like the pope or a rabbi and should not be
held accountable for alleged misdeeds of followers.
   ``I will never believe that the majority of the people of the
earth are bad...I don't believe that the good people of this earth
will ever swallow the made-up machinations of my detractors. The
real issue is what I teach.''

   OPEC oil ministers said today there was general
agreement among them to try to raise oil prices, and feuding cartel
members Kuwait and Iraq publicly played down their differences over
production quotas.
   ``We will have a new minimum reference price,'' Algerian oil
minister Sadek Boussena, OPEC's new president, told reporters after
the first two-hour session of the cartel's mid-year meeting.
``There are several positions but all of them are accepting higher
prices.''
   Libya indicated it wanted a higher quota for itself before it
would agree to an overall production cap that would bolster prices,
and Iraq wants a higher target price than some other members.
   But ministers expressed optimism they would reach an accord.
Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Hisham Nazer, said the ministers
wanted a strong pact to help in ``getting OPEC back on its feet.''
   In the days leading up to the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries conference, Iraq had threatened to retaliate,
possibly with military force, against Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates, which it accused of exceeding production quotas.
   At today's gathering, Kuwait and Iraq made a show of
friendliness amid indications that behind-the-scenes talks had
cooled down their dispute.
   Iraq's oil minister, Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, asked
whether he would press his country's concerns about excess
production, said: ``We have discussed performance ... and we are
going to concentrate on what needs to be done from now on.''
   Seated next to him in the conference room at a luxury Geneva
hotel was the Kuwaiti delegation.
   ``We are friends. We are shaking hands with each other,'' said
Kuwait's oil minister, Rasheed Salem al-Ameeri. ``It is just
something which will be resolved.''
   Iraq had reportedly massed troops along its disputed border with
Kuwait to bolster oil and land claims. But diplomatic sources in
Baghdad said Iraq had agreed to pull the troops back, and an Iraqi
official confirmed that representatives of the countries would open
talks this weekend in Saudi Arabia.
   Chalabi denied today that the troops were even dispatched.
   ``There is no such thing as massing of troops along the
border,'' he said.
   The OPEC ministers have been under intense pressure to try to
defuse the crisis between the two Persian Gulf producers and forge
a united front on prices and production.
   Boussena, the cartel president, said OPEC's ``fortunes have
faded badly,'' carrying the risk of bring member countries'
economies ``to the brink of collapse.''
   He told his colleagues today that the ``core of our problems
lies ... in the lack of determination to keep a steady course of
action.''
   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have indicated a willingness
to end the overproduction that prompted Iraq's threats. Publicly,
however, the oil ministers of both countries denied they were
pumping too much oil.
   ``We don't cheat,'' Mana Saeed Otaiba of the United Arab
Emirates said today. ``We produce what we say is our quota.''
   Ameeri, the Kuwaiti oil minister, said his country was
``producing within'' its supply quota of 1.5 million barrels a day.
   However, analysts say both countries have been pumping as much
as 2 million barrels a day.
   The ministers of the 13-nation cartel appeared to be in
agreement that their target price of $18 a barrel should be raised
by at least $2.
   ``There is a general feeling that we want to have the price at
least $20,'' Indonesian Oil Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said
today. Iraq has proposed a target of $25 a barrel.
   But any new target price would have little effect on the world
markets without a tight rein on production. The current world oil
glut is keeping the cartel's average price down to about $16 a
barrel.
   Crude oil prices dropped sharply in the spring, a decline blamed
mostly on overproduction by Kuwait and the U.A.E.
   The average price of a basket of crudes monitored by the cartel
soared to $20.46 a barrel in early January, but plunged to $13.64
less than six months later. It bounced back to $16.25 last week.
   To try to lift prices even more, the ministers were expected to
agree to a proposal arranged by Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf
producers to limit total production to about 22.5 million barrels a
day in the coming months.
   Such an accord would require the cartel to slice output, with
Kuwait and the U.A.E. holding output to 1.5 million barrels a day
each.
   A confidential OPEC report, according to sources, estimated the
group's supply at 23.5 million barrels a day in the April-June
quarter of this year.
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto said demand for the cartel's oil
was expected to run at 21.8 million barrels a day in the third
quarter, rising to 24.4 million barrels in the last three months of
the year.
   OPEC members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E. and
Venezuela.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Edge Higher; Grains Open Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices edged higher in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid reports of
stronger soybean meal trade in Europe.
   Corn and wheat futures opened narrowly mixed.
   Speculation that the Soviet Union is preparing to buy more U.S.
agricultural products also supported the grain and soybean markets,
analysts said. That stemmed from reports that the Soviets received
a $1 billion advance from the De Beers diamond cartel as part of an
agreement under which De Beers will market Soviet diamonds.
   But gains were tempered by forecasts for more beneficial crop
weather in the Midwest. The National Weather Service's latest
six-to-10-day outlook predicts warmer- and wetter-than-normal
conditions for the region during most of next week.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent lower to { cent
higher with the contract for delivery in September at $3.01{ a
bushel; corn was { cent lower to 1\ cents higher with September at
$2.60\ a bushel; oats were { cent lower to 1 cent higher with
September at $1.30 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 4 cents
higher with August at $5.86} a bushel.
   Livestock futures were mixed while pork bellies were sharply
higher in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .20 cent lower to .27 cent higher with August
77.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent lower to .13 cent
higher with August at 88.47 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged
to .45 cent lower with August at 60.27 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .55 cent to 1.25 cents higher with August at 48.35
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures rose sharply on Wednesday.

   An unassuming blue building along the
highway north of town snags motorists' eyes with a sparkling silver
goblet atop a sign that reads, ``Salisbury Pewter, Buses Welcome,
Gift Shop.''
   Sounds like one of those tourist places to buy last-minute gifts
for relatives you forgot about while on vacation. It is. Prices
start at $5.
   But Salisbury Pewter is more than an inexpensive trinket joint.
It makes pewter for presidents.
   The Reagans took 352 pewter jewelry boxes from Salisbury Pewter
to the Moscow Summit in Helsinki in 1988. Nancy Reagan gave pewter
candy dishes, engraved with her signature, to senators' wives. The
couple once ordered 6-inch trays engraved with the presidential
seal and both their names.
   ``We did a mess of work for the Reagans,'' said Salisbury native
Terry Gladden, president and co-owner of the company, which is
projecting $1.5 million to $2 million in sales this year.
   Vice President Dan Quayle orders small, rounded baby cups
engraved with a replica of the vice president's Washington
residence. The Quayle name is stamped on the bottom.
   ``They usually get about 25 to 50 at a time. I guess they give
them out as gifts to friends with babies,'' Gladden said.
   Regular customers include members of the Senate and House, every
branch of the armed services, colleges and universities nationwide,
the Maryland legislature and the Du Pont Co., among others.
   Tiffany &amp; Co.'s 1990 corporate Christmas catalog included four
items from Salisbury Pewter _ a candy dish, cup, jewelry box and
purse mirror.
   Tiffany has been a customer for several years, but all its
products must be stamped with Tiffany's name, Gladden said.
   The name doesn't matter. Gladden and his employees know who made
it.
   ``I never thought I'd be in a Tiffany catalog. But it's because
of the quality of the work we're giving,'' Gladden said. His
employees ``really get fascinated when we get these special orders
in here. It builds their ego.''
   He said 85 to 90 percent of the business is custom work.
   Each piece is made by hand with a polished pewter that looks
like silver but is much cheaper, Gladden said.
   The most expensive item is a 10-inch punch bowl for $250. The
baby cups bought by the Quayles sell for $25. An engraved, sterling
silver cup would cost about $250 and still look like one of
Salisbury Pewter's cups, Gladden said.
   ``Everything here is made one piece at a time. It's all
handcrafted like it was in the 1800s,'' he said. ``It's hand-spun,
then hand-trademarked, then hand-polished.''
   Still, there's one modern embellishment. Some engraving is done
by computer, said Lynn L. Parsons, the engraving supervisor. She
engraves by hand if the design is not available on a computer disk.
   ``You have to learn the right pressure for your hand so you know
how deep to go. It takes a steady hand,'' she said.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Bank Corp. announced today it was
moving to terminate a federal regulating agency's control of its
interests.
   Continental officials said they planned to file a shelf
registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission
that would bring about the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s
release of its remaining 26 percent equity interest in the bank
holding company.
   The FDIC acquired ownership of Continental stock in 1984 as part
of a restructuring agreement providing federal assistance to the
company.
   In recent years, the FDIC has sold nearly 36 million shares of
Continental common stock for about $788 million in three public
offerings and in a sale to the Continental Employees Stock
Ownership Plan. The federal agency has also sold 12.8 million
shares of Class A preferred stock to Continental for $273 million.
   The restructuring agreement will be terminated if the FDIC
releases its remaining interest, with the proceeds of the sale
going to the FDIC.
   ``This is a milestone with both financial and psychological
significance for us,'' said Continental Chairman Thomas C.
Theobald. ``Many people have worked long and hard to get us back to
this point.''

   Retiring General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger
Smith will drive the first completed Saturn car off the assembly
line next week, a Saturn spokesman said Thursday.
   Spokesman Don Haberek said Smith will drive the car off the line
at the Spring Hill, Tenn., manufacturing complex in a private
ceremony on Monday, the day before Smith ends 41 years with GM, the
last 9{ as chairman.
   Haberek declined to say what GM planned to do with the car, but
said only that it was ``a car intended for sale.''
   Saturn plans to begin supplying cars to a separate dealer
network this fall. Base prices haven't been announced, but are
expected to be between $10,000 and $12,000.
   GM said the car, conceived more than eight years ago, is
designed to compete with cars made in the United States and Japan
by Japanese automakers.
   There had been speculation that problems with plastic car parts
put Saturn in danger of failing to complete the first Saturn car in
time for Smith to drive it, but GM had said the deadline would be
met.

   Republican budget negotiators are proposing
higher taxes on alcohol as part a $50 billion package of taxes and
spending cuts for next year, Sen. Bob Packwood said today.
   President Bush, meanwhile, is considering asking Congress to
forego its month-long August recess if a budget deal is not struck
soon, his spokesman said.
   ``There is a possibility that the president would ask the
Congress to stay,'' said presidential press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater. Bush would ``probably stay as well'' and give up his
planned three-week vacation in Kennebunkport, Maine, next month if
that becomes necessary, Fitzwater said.
   ``We would like to reach an agreement before the recess, that is
the goal certainly that we have and we hope that the Democrats
share that general time frame,'' Fitzwater said. He said ``no
decision has been made'' yet on whether to keep Congress in town,
suggesting there was still time to strike a deal.
   Bush and congressional leaders held their third consecutive
morning meeting to discuss the slow-moving, 11-week-old
negotiations today, but broke no new ground. Fiscal 1991 begins in
just more than two months, on Oct. 1, and Congress plans to begin a
month-long recess after next week.
   White House officials took a new budget proposal to Capitol Hill
Wednesday evening and got the backing of most GOP leaders involved
in the talks.
   The package consists of slightly more than $50 billion in
savings, split roughly evenly between new taxes and spending cuts,
according to Packwood, an Oregon Republican, and others. The 1991
deficit is expected to reach at least $169 billion unless action is
taken, more than enough to trigger huge spending cuts under the
Gramm-Rudman law.
   The proposal includes higher excise taxes on alcohol, but
otherwise resembles the taxes Bush proposed in the budget he
released in January, Packwood told reporters today.
   Bush's spending plan included a cut in the capital gains tax
rate, which Republicans argue would increase revenues because it
would encourage the sales of property, and several minor new taxes.
   The new administration proposal would raise about $3 billion by
limiting the deductability of state and local income taxes on
federal tax returns, a GOP bargainer said today. Such deductions
would be limited to no more than $10,000, said the negotiator, who
asked not to be identified.
   The package does not include two other types of taxes _ on
tobacco and on luxury items such as jewelry _ that the negotiators
have been considering, said the official.
   The official also said the new administration package would
slash benefit programs by $16 billion, including $6 billion in cuts
to Medicare. It would cut defense spending by about $7 billion _
several billion dollars less than Democrats prefer _ and pare
domestic and foreign aid programs by $4 billion more.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, speaking with reporters
after today's White House session, said major disagreement remains
with the administration and Republicans over taxes, ``the
composition of the package, who pays and how much.''
   Gephardt, D-Mo., said today's talks included a discussion of tax
options, including Democratic proposals for raising taxes on the
richest Americans.
   Some Democrats have advocated doing away with the so-called
``bubble'' in the tax code, where middle-income Americans are taxed
at a rate of 33 percent but joint filers earning upwards of
$162,000 pay a lower 28 percent rate.
   ``We feel the tax code has become unprogressive,'' Gephardt
said. However, ideas for eliminating the bubble by increasing taxes
on the wealthy to 33 percent have not been well received by
Republicans, participants in budget talks have suggested.
   There remain ``large and tough and difficult disagreements to
bridge,'' Gephardt said.
   But Senate Minority Leade Bob Dole, R-Kan., said: ``We're making
some progress. It may be hard to tell from the outside. But from
the inside, I think we're making progress.''
   ``We're at the hard stage now, trying to decide whether to stay
here in August and get it done,'' he added.
   The GOP plan would save more than $500 billion over five years,
relying heavily on cuts in benefit programs such as Medicare but
leaving Social Security untouched, said one participant who asked
to not be identified. Bargainers declined to discuss other details.
   But it remained unclear just when _ and how _ the Republicans
would offer the plan to Democrats.
   ``We'll have one to present to them if they give one to us,''
said Packwood.
   Democratic negotiators met among themselves Wednesday and did
not complete a proposal of their own. They are also at savings of
$50 billion in 1991 and $500 billion over five years.
   ``We haven't gotten to the point where you put it all together
yet,'' said Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that as early as
today, both sides will ``simultaneously'' put proposals on the
table.
   But Democrats disputed that, saying no decision had been made on
exchanging offers. They said they were reluctant to advance a
proposal unless they knew the Republicans had a serious offer of
their own.
   They also evidenced lingering distrust from recent Bush attacks
on Democratic spending policies and an informal vote by House
Republicans to oppose tax increases.
   ``If the president wants an agreement, the president is going to
have to help both publicly and privately,'' Fowler said.
   Separately, the House Ways and Means Committee approved
legislation extending federal authority to borrow money.
   The government is expected to reach its $3.122 trillion limit on
borrowing next month. Because Congress will be in recess, lawmakers
must approve legislation extending that ceiling before leaving town.

<HEAD>National Power Posts Huge Loss, To Cut 5,000 Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Power PLC, a British electricity
generating company preparing for privatization, on Thursday posted
a loss of 605 million pounds, or $1.1 billion, for the year and
said it was cutting 5,000 jobs over the next five years.
   The state-owned company said it expected the job cuts to be
achieved through attrition and voluntary retirements. It currently
employs about 16,000 people, following 800 job cuts earlier this
year.
   The results for the year ended March 31 were presented as if
National Power had been an autonomous business throughout the year.
   National Power and the smaller PowerGen are the two generating
companies officially formed in March from the break-up of the
Central Electricity Generating Board. Their shares were to be
offered to the public next year.
   But earlier this week, the government said it has held
discussions with British conglomerate Hanson PLC that might lead to
the private sale of PowerGen, which produces 18,700 megawatts of
electricity annually.
   Energy Secretary John Wakeham said that if a serious takeover
proposal also was made for National Power, which produces 29,700
megawatts annually, he would have to examine that as well.
   If sold to the public, National Power could raise between 2
billion and 2.5 billion pounds, or $3.6 billion to $4.5 billion,
and PowerGen could raise 1 billion pounds, or $1.81 billion,
analysts say.
   National Power said its results included extraordinary losses of
914 million pounds, or $1.7 billion, stemming mainly from costs
associated with its restructuring ahead of privatization and the
revaluation of its coal stocks.
   During the fiscal year, National Power had an operating profit
of 456 million pounds, ot $825 million, and sales of 4 billion
pounds, or $7.2 billion.
   Per-share and year-earlier figures weren't available, the
company said.

<HEAD>Brazilian Troubles Cut Appliance Maker's Profits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BENTON HARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whirlpool Corp. said Thursday its
second-quarter profit tumbled 26 percent despite a 4.1 percent
increase in revenue and cited economic troubles affecting its
Brazilian operations.
   The manufacturer of major home appliances said its net income
sagged to $37 million, or 54 cents a share, for the three months
ended June 30, compared with $50 million, or 72 cents a share, in
the second quarter of 1989.
   Revenue for the period rose to $1.71 billion from $1.64 billion
in the April-June period in 1989.
   Whirlpool said if the results of its Brazilian appliance making
and marketing affiliates were excluded, net earnings for the
quarter would have been up 18 percent.
   Chairman David R. Whitwam said results in North America were
strong, due to higher shipment volumes, effective material cost
controls, productivity improvement and aggressive marketing efforts.
   For the first six months of the year, Whirlpool reported net
income of $66 million, or 96 cents a share, down 27.5 percent from
$91 million, or $1.31 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the first half rose 4 percent to $3.34 billion from
$3.21 billion for the first half of 1989.

<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. reached an agreement
with the government today to pay a $10 million criminal fine for
defrauding the Army on an $8 million battlefield computer system.
   The punishment, stemming from GE's conviction in a case earlier
this year, is one of the largest levied against a company in a
defense fraud but far less than the government initially wanted,
which could have exceeded $50 million.
   The agreement also called for the nation's fifth-largest
industrial company to pay $8.3 million to settle related civil
suits and $11.7 million settle unrelated matters with the
government that hadn't reached the litigation stage.
   U.S. District Judge Lowell Reed Jr., who accepted the agreement
and sentenced two former company employees involved in the case,
called the criminal fine against the company ``adequate, fair, and
in the best interest of the public.''
   GE said in a statement that company executives ``felt it was
time to close these old cases which date back to the early 1980s
and were pleased that the government has recognized the
significance and the value of the improved procedures that GE
started in 1985 by recommending a fine that is far less than the
amount they originally sought.''
   The judge said he had concluded the fine against GE was
appropriate as he accepted the agreement, which also says GE
relinquishes rights to appeal.
   The fine put GE into the ranks of large companies that have paid
multimillion dollar fines for cheating the government on defense
work in recent years.
   Northrop Corp. agreed to pay a $17 million fine in February for
falsifying records on parts for the Cruise missile and Harrier jet.
In 1988, Sundstrand Corp. agreed to pay a record fine of $115
million, the largest fraud settlement in Pentagon history.
   Former GE employee Gerald A. Leo, 52, who was convicted of four
counts of mail fraud and one count of trying to deceive federal
investigators, was sentenced to 10 months in prison and fined
$15,000.
   ``He never did anything,'' yelled his sobbing wife, Mary, when
the sentence was imposed.
   Co-defendant James Badolato, 43, convicted of misleading
auditors and smbmitting false documents, was to be sentenced later.
Both had worked for a GE subsidiary, Management &amp; Technical
Services Co.
   The company and the two employees were convicted this February
on a case stemming from a 1983 investigation.
   The government charged that the GE subsidiary did not tell the
government in 1983 that it had found substantially less expensive
subcontractors to help build the battlefield computer system, part
of a $250 million defense contract.

   The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. reported
Thursday it lost $9.4 million in the second quarter due to charges
resulting from the restructuring of tire operations and the closing
of a roofing systems plant.
   The loss amounted to 16 cents per share for the quarter ended
June 30 compared with a profit of $27.1 million, or 47 cents per
share, a year ago.
   Sales in the quarter rose slightly to $2.87 billion from $2.81
billion.
   The latest results include a charge of $21.4 million, or 37
cents a share, against earnings due to restructuring, while the
1989 results include a $95 million loss after taxes involving sales
of its South African subsidiary which has since been sold and
unused pipe owned by a pipeline subsidiary.
   For the first half, Goodyear earned $11.5 million, or 20 cents
per share, on sales of $5.56 billion compared with $121.6 million,
$2.11 per share, on sales of $5.45 billion.
   The restructuring of the North American tire operations involved
a pre-tax charge of $20 million, while a decision to close the New
Bedford, Mass., roofing plant resulted a pre-tax charge of $15
million.
   Goodyear said earnings were also adversely influenced by
depreciation of the company's All American Pipeline System, price
competition, higher costs, a strike at tire plants in Turkey and
economic reform in Brazil.
   Goodyear Chairman Tom H. Barrett said tire sales rose 2.9
percent in the quarter anmd 2.1 percent in the first half, on the
strength of gains in the U.S. replacement market.

<HEAD>GM, Ford Report Lower Second-Quarter Earnings, as Expected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economic problems in Brazil and higher incentive
costs pushed General Motors Corp.'s second-quarter profits down 40
percent and Ford Motor Co.'s earnings down 45 percent from last
year's levels, the automakers said Thursday.
   Ford also said lingering effects of strikes in Britain and
Belgium contributed to sharply lower European earnings, longtime
strengths for the company.
   Chrysler Corp. is expected to announce second-quarter profits
Tuesday. Analysts expect net income to be about half the $341
million the company earned during the period last year.
   GM, the nation's largest automaker, said it earned $900.1
million or $1.32 a share in the second quarter compared with $1.5
billion or $2.23 a share in the same period last year.
   Its second-quarter revenue rose 1.2 percent to $33.9 billion
from $33.5 billion.
   Ford said it earned $770.7 million or $1.67 a share during the
April-June period this year compared with $1.4 billion or $3 a
share last year.
   The earnings came on revenues of $26.9 billion, up 3.9 percent
from $25.9 billion a year ago.
   The GM and Ford figures were in line with what Wall Street
analysts estimated.
   Analyst Scott Merlis of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. of New York said
GM's and Ford's automotive earnings were a shade better than he
anticipated in light of Brazil's troubles and increased tax
payments.
   ``The earnings are much better than they look,'' he said.
   Ford and GM each have large operations in Brazil _ GM its own,
and Ford with West German automaker Volkswagen AG in the Autolatina
joint project.
   Both said their second-quarter earnings were dented by economic
problems in that country, where inflation was running at an annual
rate of more than 1,000 percent until the government put the brakes
on the economy earlier this year with such moves as a currency
freeze.
   In Europe, Ford had labor problems in the United Kingdom in the
first quarter and in Belgium in the second. Although the strikes
have ended, the effects of lost production and higher costs
continue to take their toll.
   Ford Vice President and Treasurer David McCammon said he
expected the Brazilian problems to continue draining potential
profit from the company in the second half of the year. The company
is having to deal with higher material and labor costs, which have
not been recovered in sales of vehicles it makes in the Autolatina
joint venture.
   ``I think Brazil will take a while,'' McCammon said. ``Europe
probably in the third quarter will continue to be a little slow for
us because we are launching the new Escort there. The fourth
quarter should be better.''
   In the United States, McCammon said, Ford spent an average of
$1,050 on incentives for each of the 889,043 cars and trucks it
sold during the period, 9 percent fewer sold than last year. GM's
sales for the quarter fell 5.6 percent to 1,323,521. Chrysler's
cars and truck sales for the quarter dropped 19.3 percent to
432,097.
   Through the first six months of the year, GM said its earnings
fell 46.7 percent to $1.6 billion or $2.34 a share, from $3 billion
or $4.60 a share a year ago.
   Revenue for the first six months fell 4.2 percent to $64 billion
from $66.8 billion last year.
   For the first half of the year, Ford's earnings fell 56.7
percent to $1.2 billion or $2.77 a share, from $3 billion or $6.45
a share during the first six months of 1989.
   First-half revenue fell 2.5 percent to $50.5 billion from $51.8
billion.

<HEAD>Posts 30 Percent Drop in Quarterly Profit, Announces Fertilizer
Restructuring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imperial Chemical Industries PLC said Thursday its
profit dropped 30 percent in the second quarter and announced it
was restructuring its fertilizer business.
   The restructuring calls for the closure of a plant in northeast
England, which will cut 640 jobs, and the sale of part of its
British fertilizer operations to Kemira Oy of Finland for an
undisclosed sum, the company said.
   The British chemical and pharmaceuticals company said its net
profit for the three months ended June 30 came to 207 million
pounds, or $360 million, compared with 294 million pounds, or $512
million, in the same period a year ago.
   The latest results included a restructuring charge of 100
million pounds, or $174 million.
   Sales were flat at 3.4 billion pounds, or $5.9 billion.
   Pre-tax profit fell 34 percent to 319 million pounds, or $555
million, from 483 million pounds, or $840 million.
   ICI said its profit for the first half fell 34 percent to 372
million pounds, or $647 million, from 562 million pounds, or $978
million, in the same period a year ago.
   Sales rose 2.7 percent to 6.82 billion pounds, or $11.9 billion,
from 6.64 billion pounds, or $11.6 billion.
   Pre-tax profit fell 21 percent to 733 million pounds, or $1.3
billion, from 925 million pounds, or $1.6 billion.
   ICI Chairman Denys Henderson said the half-year results were
disappointing. The ``next few months are going to be tough,'' he
said, but added the company was pursuing the right strategy.
   ICI said trading profit, or profit before tax and other
considerations, increased 13 percent in the consumer and specialty
products division to 356 million pounds, or $619 million.
   In the industrial products division, trading profit was down 53
percent to 216 million pounds, or $376 million.
   ICI said competitive pressures ``eroded selling prices while
costs continued to rise.''
   Trading profit at the agricultural division, including the
fertilizers businesses, was down 6.2 percent at 151 million pounds,
or $263 million. The fertilizer business' trading profit alone fell
87 percent to 2 million pounds, or $3.5 million.
   The figures were converted at a company-provided exchange rate
of 1.74 dollars to the pound.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Surge on Soymeal Strength, USSR Factors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices surged Thursday on the
Chicago Board of Trade in a rally fueled by active soybean meal
trading in Europe and speculation the Soviet Union is preparing to
make a large meal purchase.
   Grain futures ended mostly higher as bullish enthusiasm spread
from the soybean pits to the nearby wheat, corn and oat rings.
   Perceptions of an impending Soviet purchase of soybean meal
stemmed from reports that the Soviet Union received a $1 billion
advance from the De Beers diamond cartel for rough diamonds that De
Beers has agreed to market for Moscow.
   Some analysts believe the hard currency will ease a cash crunch
that has prevented the Soviets from buying agricultural commodities
on the world market.
   The Soviets also were reported to have repaid debts to soymeal
exporters, which further raised speculation they are preparing to
buy meal.
   Mickey Luth, a grains analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
said the talk of Soviet buying interest gave the soymeal market an
excuse to rally.
   ``They haven't bought any for so long, we'll take the rumor when
we can get it,'' he said.
   Soybean meal futures closed 80 cents to $4 higher with the
contract for delivery in August at $171.20 per ton.
   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 1{ cents higher with the
contract for September delivery at $3.01{ a bushel; corn was 1 cent
lower to 2{ cents higher with September at $2.63\ a bushel; oats
were 2} cents to 4 cents higher with September at $1.33 a bushel;
soybeans were 7 cents to 12{ cents higher with August at $5.93 a
bushel.

   Westinghouse Electric Corp. said Thursday it
has agreed to buy Knoll International Inc. for stock, making the
electric company one of the world's three largest makers of office
furniture.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
   ``Knoll's commanding European presence in all eight Common

designer and manufacturer of office furniture systems worldwide,''
Westinghouse Chairman Paul E. Lego said in a statement.
   Knoll, a privately held company, designs, makes and sells
modular office systems, desks, chairs and office accessories. It
has about 2,800 employees.
   Under the agreement, Westinghouse will acquire the company's
headquarters in New York and manufacturing operations in East
Greenville and Iron Run, both near Philadelphia, and in Montreal,
Milan and Paris.
   Westinghouse also will acquire Knoll's field sales and branch
offices.
   Westinghouse said it plans to combine Knoll with existing
Westinghouse North American furniture operations but will continue
to offer Westinghouse, Shaw-Walker and Reff brands along with
Knoll's.
   The acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of
September, Westinghouse said.

<HEAD>Saturn Workers Getting Private `Job One' Ceremony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers at General Motors Corp.'s Saturn
plant want a private ceremony for retiring Chairman Roger Smith to
drive the ceremonial first car off the assembly line next Monday,
GM officials said Thursday.
   Smith, who retires Tuesday, has vowed to drive the first new
Saturn out of the factory in Spring Hill, Tenn. His successor,
Robert Stempel, has said he will drive the ceremonial second car.
   Saturn's 2,600 employees _ called ``team members'' _ have
invited United Auto Workers union President Owen Bieber and Vice
President Stephen Yokich to the ceremony.
   ``The team members had asked that it be a family affair and the
opportunity to meet with Mr. Smith and Owen Beiber,'' said Bruce G.
McDonald, Saturn's vice president for communications. ``They asked
that this be a day they could spend with the chairman.''
   Bieber had not confirmed Thursday whether the union leaders will
be on hand, McDonald said.
   GM plans an October launch of Saturn, a project conceived in
1982 to recapture a market the company lost to competitors, namely
the Japanese. The original concept was a $6,000 car that got 50
miles per gallon, Smith said, although the final version is priced
at $10,000 to $12,000 and should average about 35 miles per gallon.
   ``It's changed and gotten better as technology has moved, as the
market has moved and as our targets have moved,'' Smith said.
   There was no rush to make the first car available before his
retirement, Smith told the Nashville Banner.
   ``It was much more important that the car be right than I drive
it,'' he said Wednesday night.
   ``We set this kind of thing that I was going to drive it off
five years ago, but we wanted to have something to shoot for. As it
got closer and closer, I tried to explain to them that it was much
more important for the car to be ready than for me to drive it.''
   Smith said he does not know the color or model of car he will be
driving. Saturn produces three models at the plant _ a two-door, a
basic four-door and an upscale four-door.
   ``It's going to be a secret until I get there,'' he said.
   Smith said he has no plans to keep the car.
   ``You have to always be careful of driving the first anything
off,'' he said. ``Those things belong in museums, like the first
ZR1 Corvette.''

<HEAD>Banks Extending Loans; Trump Considers Debt-Swap Plan For Casinos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald Trump and his teetering real estate
empire received another reprieve Thursday as banks prepared to
extend an emergency bridge loan the was part of a package that
saved the developer from bankruptcy.
   Sources close to the transaction said a $20 million, 30-day loan
that was to expire Thursday was in the process of being extended by
the banks involved, including Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Bankers
Trust and Manufacturers Hanover, among others.
   The loan was approved to tide Trump over until details on a
longer-term, $65 million rescue package could be finalized. Since
that financing package is moving along on schedule, and since Trump
has adequate cash flow, there is ``no problem at all'' with
extending the bridge loan, a source said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Separately, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. had no comment
on a report that the investment firm was advising Trump on a plan
that would allow bondholders in his Atlantic City, N.J., casinos to
receive equity in the gambling operations for the debt they hold.
Such a move would mean Trump could forego some interest payments on
the bonds.
   The Wall Street Journal said in Thursday's editions the deal
involves some $1.3 billion in debt on the casinos, which have
suffered from a general decline in the Northeast economy.
   Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and
cited by the Journal show that in mid-November, Trump will owe $47
million out of $210 million in interest and principal payments on
the casinos. Analysts are skeptical of his ability to come up with
the necessary cash by fall.
   The Trump Organization had no comment on either the extension of
the bridge loan or the debt-for-equity swap plan.
   Last month, Trump's major lenders extended the bridge loan so he
could make overdue payments on bonds sold to finance his Trump's
Castle hotel and casino. Had Trump failed to make the payments, he
would have been in formal default, and the assets backing those
debts could have been seized by creditors.
   The negotiations yielded a new five-year commitment from Trump's
bankers that will spread out payment on more than $2 billion in
outstanding loans over the term of the pact.

<HEAD>Reebok Chairman Agrees to $11 Million Pay Cut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOUGHTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reebok's board of directors let the air
out of chairman Paul Fireman's huge pay package, cutting it by more
than $11 million under a new five-year deal that begins Jan. 1, the
company announced Thursday.
   Fireman, a key to the company's growth into a footwear giant
that sells ``The Pump'' athletic shoe for $170, would receive no
more than $2 million in annual salary and bonuses under the new
agreement.
   His earnings could increase, however, through an option to
purchase 2.5 million shares of the company's common stock.
   Under the current agreement, which expires Dec. 31, Fireman,
also Reebok's chief executive officer, received an average of $13.6
million in salary and bonuses per year during the past four years.
That deal, struck when Reebok was much smaller, based most of his
compensation on a percentage of the company's pre-tax earnings.
   The new agreement, reached at a board meeting attended by
Fireman Tuesday, provides him with a $1 million annual salary and a
maximum potential bonus of $1 million a year, based on achievement
of the firm's profit objectives.
   ``I don't imagine he'll have trouble buying that new car,'' said
Elizabeth A. Armstrong, an analyst with Prescott Ball and Turben.
``Two million dollars is still not a bad income.''
   Fireman was on vacation and not available for comment, said Ken
Lightcap, Reebok's vice president for corporate communications.
   Reebok's sales have risen from $300 million in 1985 to $1.822
billion last year, while net income increased from $38.9 million to
$174.9 million during the same period, Lightcap said.
   He said more than 95 percent of Fireman's compensation under his
current agreement was in bonuses tied to pre-tax earnings.
   Forbes Magazine listed Fireman fifth last year and fourth this
year in its rankings of U.S. chief executives according to salary
and bonuses.
   ``His compensation before was much higher than is normal,''
Armstrong said, ``largely due to the fact that a lot of his
compensation was tied to earnings levels of the company. Probably
no one really expected the company to get the earnings levels they
achieved.
   ``I would not be surprised if he was one of the people who
arranged'' the compensation level of the new agreement, she added.
   His reduced compensation ``is really not a surprise,'' said
Heidi R. Steinberg, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. ``It was
pretty well known that he would be taking this pay cut. The
contract that he's been on was negotiated before Reebok had made
its stellar success.''
   The deal gives Fireman the option of buying 2.5 million shares
of stock in stages over a five-year period. He can exercise the
option for 10 years from the agreement's starting date.
   ``It's not a question of him getting a big bonus as he did in
the past,'' Lightcap said. ``Now his stock options are on the same
basis as anybody else's stock options are.''
   Armstrong said the new agreement ``is better for the company
because, just doing simple math, it will save the company about six
cents a share after tax. And yet there's still the incentive,
obviously, for Mr. Fireman to be rewarded for improving the
company, not only the cash bonus ... but also the award of the
options.''

<HEAD>Dollar Rises Against Yen; Mixed Elsewhere</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose against the Japanese yen but
finished mixed against most other major currencies in seesaw
trading Thursday.
   Gold prices ended mostly lower. On the Commodity Exchange in New
York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $369.30 a troy
ounce, down $2.70 from late Wednesday. Republic National Bank in
New York quoted a late bid for gold at $368.80 an ounce, $2.20
lower.
   The dollar got a boost initially in Tokyo when traders began
selling yen, which lost ground across the board. Analysts said
investors remain concerned about recent stock market swings in
Tokyo as well as the uncertainty over whether the Bank of Japan
will move to raise interest rates.
   Higher interest rates in Japan would tend to support then yen by
making yen-denominated fixed-income investments more attractive.
   Bob Morrissey, senior trader at the Bank of Boston's New York
office, said there were rumors that the Federal Reserve had entered
the market to sell dollars and buy yen in an effort to stem the
dollar's rise. But those rumors were not confirmed.
   Trading was active. The dollar finished mixed in Europe and
traded higher when dealings shifted to the United States. But
profit-taking late in the U.S. session left the dollar lower
against all currencies but the yen at the close.
   Morrissey noted there was some position-squaring ahead of
Friday's release of second-quarter U.S. gross national product
data. The figures might provide an impetus for the Fed to trim
interest rates in an effort to stimulate the economy.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.98 yen to a closing 150.11 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a rate of 150.10 yen. In New
York, the dollar closed at 150.35 yen, up from 149.83 yen on
Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.8133 from $1.8125 late
Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.8145 to buy one pound, more
expensive than Wednesday's $1.8120.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates included: 1.6230 West German marks, down from
1.6245; 1.3773 Swiss francs, down form 1.3800; 5.4360 French
francs, down from 5.4445; 1,187.50 Italian lire, down from
1,188.75; and 1.1527 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1536.

<HEAD>Rose $1.93 Billion, Third Straight Weekly Rise</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund
Report are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the
week ended Wednesday.</NOTE>

   Assets of the nation's 513 money market mutual
funds rose $1.93 billion in the latest week to $391.84 billion, the
Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise followed a $3.67 billion increase in the fund assets
the previous week, the Washington-based mutual fund trade group
said. It was the third straight weekly rise despite a recent
weakness in interest rates, which can draw money out of money
market funds and into other investments.
   Fund assets hit a record high $392.14 billion in the week ended
March 21.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 251 general purpose funds rose $1.21 billion to $135.91
billion, assets of 102 broker-dealer funds rose $356.6 million to
$160.75 billion, and assets of 160 institutional funds rose $366
million to $95.18 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.59 percent from 7.66 percent the
previous week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.65 percent from 7.66 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
44 days, up from 43 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts fell to 6.12 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.14 percent a week earlier. The North Palm Beach,
Fla.-based newsletter said the effective annual yield available on
special savings accounts, called Super NOW accounts, remained
unchanged from a week earlier at 5.03 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.86
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.89
percent the previous week. Yields were 8.03 percent on 1-year CDs,
down from 8.06 percent; 8.06 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.08
percent; and 8.14 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.16 percent.

<HEAD>Unleaded Gasoline Futures Soar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline soared more than 2
cents a gallon in choppy, nervous trading Thursday on technical
factors and anticipation that OPEC members may soon reach a formal
agreement for slashing oil production.
   Crude oil prices, meanwhile, settled slightly lower and heating
oil posted a moderate gain.
   ``The market perception is that OPEC is serious this time'' in
adjusting its oil output, said William Byers, an energy analyst
with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. ``If OPEC can reach an accord and make it
stick, it's going to mean higher prices for consumers at the
(gasoline) pumps.''
   Unleaded gasoline futures have risen around 10 cents a gallon
since June just on anticipation of an OPEC cut, Byers said.
   In Thursday trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
August contract for unleaded gasoline settled up 2.22 cents to
65.26 cents a gallon, after losing 0.24 cent on Wednesday. Other
contract months were higher.
   Traders said reports of substantial progress in this week's OPEC
production talks in Geneva, along with technical factors, were
pushing up gasoline futures.
   Oil ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries confirmed Thursday they had agreed to raise the cartel's
price for crude oil.
   According to an OPEC source, formal agreement is near on raising
OPEC's target price to between $21 and $22 per barrel from the
current $18 target price that was set nearly four years ago.
   An oil glut had sent prices to as low as $13.64 a barrel earlier
this year.
   To raise prices OPEC reportedly will be proposing a new
production ceiling of 22.5 million barrels a day for the entire
cartel, an increase over the current ceiling of 22.09 million, but
far short of the 23.5 million experts say the cartel actually has
been producing.
   Among other refined petroluem products traded on the exchange
Thursday, the August contract for wholesale heating oil settled at
57.32 cents a gallon, gaining 0.56 cent, the same amount it had
declined on Wednesday.
   The September contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude, dropped 8 cents to $20.30 a
42-gallon barrel, after falling 18 cents the previous session.
Other contract months, however, were moderately higher.
   In natural gas trading, the September contract settled at $1.435
per 1,000 cubic feet, down from $1.440 Wednesday. Contracts for
later delivery were mixed.

   Persistent worries about corporate profits
helped push stock prices lower Thursday as activity continued to
slow from its recent active pace.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 10.15 to
2,920.79.
   Declining issues held a slight edge on advances in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 701 up, 778
down and 524 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 155.04 million
shares, down from 163.53 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 195.70 million shares.
   Analysts said traders remained fearful of sudden selloffs in
individual stocks in cases where company earnings reports fall
short of expectations.
   That phenomenon has occurred over the past few weeks in such
big-name issues as American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, Dow Chemical and
McDonald's Corp.
   On Thursday, much attention was focused on automobile stocks as
major American manufacturers posted their results for the second
quarter of the year.
   General Motors, which posted profits of $1.32 a share against
$2.23 in the corresponding quarter of 1989, slipped &rsqb; to 47\.
   Ford Motor lost &rsqb; to 41~ after the company reported
second-quarter earnings of $1.67 a share, down from $3 a share in
the like period last year.
   Elsewhere, Philip Morris fell 1} to 47\ and American Brands was
down 3&rsqb; at 66&lsqb; in a weak tobacco group. The New Jersey Supreme
Court, differing from past rulings in other courts, ruled that
health warnings on cigarette packs don't shield manufacturers from
product-liability suits.
   Compaq Computer dropped 1{ to 57~ after reporting an earnings
gain for the second quarter that analysts described as slightly
disappointing.
   Data General slumped 1 to 7~. The company reported a $21.4
million loss for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, and said it
believed its hopes for a profit in the current quarter were
unlikely to be fulfilled.
   Energy stocks fell for the second straight session. Exxon was
down } at 48~; Chevron } at 77; Mobil 1 at 65; Texaco { at 61}, and
Atlantic Richfield 1| at 124&lsqb;.
   Windmere Corp., which reported a small second-quarter profit
against a loss in the comparable period last year, climbed ~ to 5~.
   Black &amp; Decker gained ~ to 15~, also on a swing back to
profitability for its second quarter.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $8.77 billion, or 0.26
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .55 to 194.55.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.81 to 421.30, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 1.18 at 355.91.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Surge With Signs Of Soviet Demand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices surged Thursday on the Chicago Board of
Trade in a rally fueled by perceptions that the Soviet Union is
shopping for soybean meal after a months-long absence from world
commodity markets.
   Grain futures ended mostly higher as bullish enthusiasm spread
from the soybean pits to the nearby wheat, corn and oat rings.
   On other commodity markets, gasoline futures rose sharply;
copper extended recent gains; precious metals were mixed; and
livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Soybean futures settled 7 cents to 12 cents higher in Chicago
with the contract for delivery in August at $5.92{ a bushel.
Soybean meal futures settled 80 cents to $4 higher with August at
$171.10 per ton.
   Wheat futures ended unchanged to 1{ cents higher with September
at $3.01} a bushel; corn was \ cent to 2} cents higher with
September at $2.63{ a bushel; oats were 2} cents to 4 cents higher
with September at $1.33 a bushel.
   Analysts cited various signs that the Soviet Union has returned
or will soon return to the marketplace after suspending much of its
import buying several months ago due to a lack of hard currency.
   Traders made much of a $1 billion advance Moscow received from
the De Beers diamond cartel as part of deal under which De Beers
will market Soviet diamonds.
   The Soviets also are believed to have received billions of
dollars in credit in recent weeks from West Germany and several
other nations.
   ``They've gotten in the last two weeks a total of $9 billion in
an assortment of cash and credit. That's a lot of money they can
buy food and pay off debt with,'' said William Biedermann, research
director with the commodities brokerage Allendale Inc. in Crystal
Lake, Ill.
   Heavy trading of soybean meal in Europe Thursday was taken as a
sign of Soviet buying. And reports that the Soviets had repaid
debts to some U.S. soy meal exporters raised speculation that
Moscow was preparing to make new purchases.
   Mickey Luth, grains analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
said the talk of Soviet buying interest was a good excuse for the
soybean complex to rally, whether the speculation pans out or not.
   ``They haven't bought any for so long, we'll take the rumor when
we can get it,'' he said.
   Gasoline futures rose strongly on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, reflecting signs of tightening supplies of gasoline for
prompt delivery in the Northeast.
   Petroleum futures also were supported by news that OPEC oil
ministers meeting in Geneva are expected to ratify on Friday a
higher target price for crude oil and new crude production quotas.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents lower to 21
cents higher with September at $20.30 a barrel; heating oil was .02
cent to .57 cent higher with August at 57.32 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .12 cent to 2.22 cents higher with August at
65.26 cents a gallon.
   Copper futures made their fourth strong advance in the last five
sessions on New York's Commodity Exchange amid continuing concerns
over available supplies.
   Mining and refinery employees of Peru's state-owned Mineroperu
metals company began a strike Thursday, which also supported the
copper market.
   Copper finished 1.15 cents to 1.80 cents higher with July at
$1.255 a pound.
   Gold futures fell in New York, erasing more than half of
Wednesday's gains.
   Gold settled $2.80 to $2.90 lower with August at $369.60 a troy
ounce; silver was 2 cents to 2.2 cents higher with July at $4.85 a
troy ounce.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle futures were .02
cent lower to .32 cent higher with August at 77.65 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .35 cent higher with August at
88.62 cents a pound; live hogs were .55 cent lower to .03 cent
higher with August at 60.12 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.15 cent lower to 1.83 cents higher with August at 48.95 cents a
pound.

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply fell in the week ended July 16, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,273.7 billion from a revised $3,274.0 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$4,051.6 billion from $4,058.0 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $807.9 billion from $810.5 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 3.5 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 was 0.8 percent, which is below the
Fed's target range of 1 percent to 5 percent. The Fed has not set a
target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,269.0 billion, a 1.4
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,056.0 billion, down 0.3 percent, while M1
rose 2.5 percent to an average of $807.7 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $653 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$409 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $303
million in the two weeks ended July 18, down from a revised $502
million in the previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $307.7 billion in the two-week period ended
July 11, down from $309.1 billion two weeks earlier.

   United Airlines parent UAL Corp. posted a 5 percent gain in
second-quarter profits on Thursday, partly because of gains from
aircraft sales, while Delta Air Lines said its net income tumbled
by 61 percent due to competition and rising fuel prices.
   Separately, Chicago-based Midway Airlines Inc. posted an $11.4
million net loss during the three months ended June 30.

<BYLINE>UAL</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL said it had net income of $148.3 million, or $6.81 per
share, in the second quarter, including a gain of $77.3 million
from the sale of nine aircraft. The profit compared with net income
of $141.1 million, or $6.52 per share, in the year-earlier quarter,
which included a $5 million gain from aircraft sales.
   Sales during the quarter rose to $2.74 billion from $2.52
billion.
   Operating income fell to $178.5 million from $221.6 million in
the second quarter of 1989, while operating expenses rose to $2.57
billion from $2.29 billion, UAL said.
   UAL has accepted a $4.38 billion buyout offer from its
employees, who have until Aug. 9 to obtain financing for the
acquisition.
   Stephen Wolf, UAL's chairman, said the latest results showed
that United ``is very much on target in executing the strategic
plan we formulated two years ago.''
   For the first six months of 1990, UAL had net income of $111.9
million, or $5.14 per share, on sales of $5.26 billion. That
compared with net income of $206.5 million, or $9.55 per share, on
sales of $4.84 billion in the first half of 1989.

   The Atlanta-based airline said its net income for the three

$190.8 million, or $3.87 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell to
$2.24 billion from $2.31 billion.
   Thomas J. Roeck Jr., Delta's chief financial officer, said
results were depressed by fare competition that produced widespread
rate-cutting and rising fuel prices.
   Delta also suffered from a comparison with a year-earlier
results that were inflated because of the devastating strike
against competitor Eastern Airlines, Roeck said in a news release.
   For its full fiscal year, Delta saw its profit drop 34.3 percent
to $302.8 million, or $5.79 per share, from $460.9 million, or
$9.37 per share. Operating revenue rose to $8.58 billion from $8.01

   Chicago-based Midway's financial performance continued to

   Midway had a net loss of $11.4 million, or $1.24 a share, in its
second quarter compared with net income of $5.1 million, or 45
cents per share, for the same period a year earlier.
   Sales rose to $170.6 million in the quarter from $126.5 million.
   Alfred Altschul, Midway's vice president of finance and chief
financial officer, said the results represented a ``significant
improvement'' over the first quarter, when Midway posted a $23
million loss.
   ``We are making excellent progress in the development of our new
Philadelphia hub and we are encouraged by strong growth trends in
our traffic and advanced bookings of the months of July and
August,'' said Alfred Altschul, Midway's vice president of finance
and chief financial officer.
   For the first six months of 1990, Midway lost $34.4 million, or
$3.63 per share, on sales of $327.7 million. That compared with net
income of $8 million, or 72 cents per share, on sales of $243.7
million in the first six months of 1989.

<HEAD>Attacks Merrill Lynch Report</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Trump</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gaming giant Bally Manufacturing Corp. accused
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. on Thursday of smearing its financial
reputation to divert attention from support that the nation's
biggest brokerage gave Donald Trump's Taj Mahal resort. Merrill
denied the accusation.
   Bally chairman Robert Mullane said he was outraged because of a
July 11 analysis by Merrill analysts Richard Byrne and David Waill,
which said Bally was excessively indebted and must take aggressive
action to stay solvent through 1991. Bally is one of Trump's main
rivals in the gambling business.
   ``The smell of this is awful,'' Mullane said.
   ``It's hard to believe they would do that, unless they had a
preconceived notion to get this company,'' he said. ``I think
somebody ought to remember the people that brought you the Bally
criticism brought you the Taj Mahal bonds.''
   Merrill Lynch is one of the underwriters of bonds for the Taj
Mahal in Atlantic City, N.J., one of the most extravagant gaming
casino-hotels in the country.
   But brokerage officials denied Mullane's contentions and said
they stood by the analysis of Bally, a leading gaming equipment and
hotel-casino company, based in Chicago.
   The investment firm, the nation's largest, had no comment
Thursday on a report that it was advising Trump on a plan that
would allow bondholders in his Atlantic City casinos to receive
equity for the debt they hold.
   That would mean Trump could forego some interest payments on the
bonds, which have but enormous pressure on the New York developer's
own shaky financial structure.
   The Wall Street Journal said in Thursday's editions the deal
involves $1.3 billion in debt on the casinos, which have suffered
from a general decline in the Northeast economy.
   ``It's my personal opinion there has been a concentrated effort
by a major brokerage house to discredit Bally in an effort to help
direct attention away from the problem they had,'' Mullane said in
a telephone interview Thursday from his Chicago office.
   Martin Fridson, managing director in charge of high yield
research at Merrill Lynch's New York office, denied any
relationship between the Bally report and the Trump bonds.
   ``A given report has nothing to do with another company,''
Fridson said. ``We see no reason to modify the (Bally) report.''
   Bally operates two hotel-casinos in Atlantic City, where Trump
opened his Taj Mahal earlier this year. The company also has a
hotel-casino in Las Vegas, and one in Reno.
   In addition, the company has a chain of health fitness centers
and manufactures gaming and amusement equipment.
   Mullane spoke after issuing a financial report that showed
Bally's second-quarter earnings totaled $9.2 million. The results
compared with earnings of $21.5 million a year earlier, but that
stemmed from a one-time, $34 million gain on the sale of a
subsidiary, without which Bally would have shown a loss.
   Company revenues increased from $519 million in the second
quarter of 1989 to $554 million in the same period this year.
   Mullane charged the writers of the Merrill Lynch report had
grossly undervalued Bally properties in Las Vegas and Reno. The
report said the 2,900-room hotel-casino in Las Vegas and the
2,000-room resort in Reno were appraised at $525 million but had an
actual value of $225 million to $300 million.
   ``The hotel in Las Vegas sits on the most valuable piece of land
in the casino business,'' Mullane said. ``If that property isn't in
the $500 million range, I'd be shocked.''
   He estimated the value of the Reno property at $100 million to
$125 million, but added ``I'm not in the mode to sell them.
   ``They went out and put ridiculous prices on them to create this
nonsense story,'' Mullane said.
   Mullane said the company was considering selling its health and
fitness division, but denied the company needed to sell any assets
to meet principal and interest payments.
   He agreed with the analysts that the opening of the Mirage Hotel
in Las Vegas and the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City had cut into

   OPEC oil ministers said Thursday they agreed to
raise the cartel's ceiling price for crude oil, and OPEC President
Sadek Boussena criticized members who drove down the price by
exceeding production quotas.
   His comments were apparently directed in part at Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates, who are blamed for keeping oil prices low by
cheating on their quotas.
   OPEC's decision to raise the ceiling price came after it
received assurances that overproduction by Kuwait and the U.A.E.
would end and that overall world production of oil would decrease.
   The price of wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 2.2 cents a gallon
Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, settling at 65.26
cents _ partly in anticipation that OPEC members may soon reach a
formal agreement for cutting oil production.
   ``The market perception is that OPEC is serious this time,''
William Byers, an energy analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., said.
``If OPEC can reach an accord and make it stick, it's going to mean
higher prices for consumers at the pumps.''
   A row between Kuwait and Iraq over the quota issue appeared to
have been defused as the ministers of the 13-nation group began
their regular mid-year conference.
   Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi sat next to his
Kuwaiti counterpart, Rashid Saleem al-Ameeri, at the conference
table. The two chatted and laughed before the start of the meeting.
   Iraq on Thursday scaled back a weeklong intimidation campaign
against Kuwait, which reportedly included a military buildup along
the Iraq-Kuwait border. Leaders of Kuwait and Iraq were scheduled
to meet in Saudi Arabia this weekend to try to resolve their
differences.
   A ministerial source said formal agreement was near on raising
OPEC's target price several dollars a barrel and setting a new
production ceiling of 22.5 million barrels a day for the entire
cartel. This would be an increase over the current ceiling of 22.09
million, but far short of the 23.5 million barrels that experts say
the cartel has actually been producing.
   The new benchmark price is expected to be $21 to $22 per barrel,
the source said. Iraq had hoped for $25 a barrel.
   The current $18 target price was set in December 1986, but an
oil glut sent prices down to as low as $13.64 a barrel this year.
The price rose to $16.25 a barrel last week.
   Every dollar decline or rise in the price of a barrel of oil
amounts to about a five-cent change in gas prices for consumers at
the pump.
   The source predicted the ministers of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries would ratify the accord Friday, when
formal talks resumed.
   Algerian Oil Minister Boussena, OPEC's new president, told
reporters after a two-hour midday session: ``We will have a new
minimum reference price.''
   ``There are several positions but all of them are accepting
higher prices,'' he said.
   Indonesian minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita, elected OPEC's
alternate president, said: ``There is a general feeling that we
want to have the price at least $20.''
   Libyan minister Fawzi Shakshuki demanded a higher production
quota for his country before agreeing to a new cartel production
cap of 22.5 million barrels a day, as proposed by Saudi Arabia and
other Persian Gulf producers.
   Under the proposal, only the U.A.E. production quota would
increase, by 400,000 barrels a day. All other quotas would remain
the same.
   Shakshuki said: ``There should be no increase unless Libya
shares.''
   The ministers of Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates denied
their countries have been producing more than their quotas _ 1.5
million barrels for Kuwait and 1.1 million for the U.A.E. Analysts
say each has been pumping about 2 million barrels daily.
   The alleged overproduction was at the heart of the recent rise
in tensions involving Iraq. Iraq, badly in need of cash to rebuild
after eight years of war with Iran, claims it has lost $14 billion
in oil revenues because of low prices caused by overproduction.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein last week threatened to retaliate
against countries ignoring their OPEC production caps. He also
accused Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion worth of oil from a field
that includes land claimed by both countries.
   Boussena denounced violations of output caps.
   OPEC's ``fortunes have faded badly'' and the nations' economies
risk being brought ``to the brink of collapse,'' he said.

   The Bush administration readied a
budget-cutting plan Thursday that would boost taxes on wine and
beer more than five-fold next year, limit the deductibility of
state and local income taxes and cut social programs, Republican
negotiators said.
   Their proposal, to be submitted to congressional Democrats at
the 11-week-old budget summit talks, envisioned overall deficit
cuts next year of about $54 billion, split about evenly between new
taxes and lower spending, a GOP bargainer said.
   As part of the plan, the 3-cent levy on the standard 750
milliliter bottle of wine would be boosted to 76 cents. The tax on
a six-pack of beer, now 16 cents, would be increased five-fold to
81 cents, the official said.
   Combined, the higher levies would add $7 billion to the
government's coffers.
   Democratic congressional leaders, meanwhile, met separately and
all but concluded that no budget compromise will be reached until
at least September. Congress' month-long summer recess begins in
early August, and many lawmakers fear that a partially completed
pact would lose support while senators and representatives were at
home.
   ``That is the clear preference of the congressional
leadership,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta,
D-Calif. ``But it is also clear that if the president wishes to
proceed, the leadership will concur with that.''
   The third consecutive day of high-level budget talks at the
White House got down to specific tax suggestions as administration
officials circulated a new proposal among key congressional
Republicans.
   Although details of the package were sketchy, Sen. Bob Packwood,
R-Ore., said it included higher excise taxes on alcohol but
otherwise resembled the taxes Bush proposed in his January budget.
   Packwood and others said the proposal, which may be formally
presented to budget negotiators Friday, consists of slightly more
than $50 billion in savings, split about evenly between new taxes
and spending cuts. It also renews Bush's call for a cut in the
capital gains tax rate and proposes several minor new taxes.
   The deficit in fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, is expected to
reach at least $169 billion unless action is taken. That size
shortfall would trigger $100 billion or more in spending cuts under
the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, slashing most domestic
programs by 40 percent and defense programs by 25 percent.
   The new administration proposal would raise about $3 billion by
limiting the deductibility of state and local income taxes on
federal tax returns, a GOP bargainer said. Such deductions would be
limited to no more than $10,000, said the negotiator, who asked not
to be identified.
   However, Gov. Mario Cuomo said the administration could balance
the budget if it raised the taxes of wealthy Americans.
   ``If you want to find wealth, don't come to us and take it out
of the pockets of children,'' Cuomo said at a news conference here
with state and local officials who oppose limiting the
deductibility of state and local income taxes.
   The latest administration package does not include taxes on
tobacco or luxury items such as jewelry, which negotiators have
been considering, said the negotiator who asked not to be
identified.
   The official also said the package would cut benefit programs by
$16 billion, including $6 billion from Medicare. It would cut
defense spending by about $7 billion _ several billion dollars less
than Democrats want _ and pare domestic and foreign aid programs by
$4 billion more.
   The GOP plan would save more than $500 billion over five years,
relying heavily on cuts in benefit programs such as Medicare but
leaving Social Security untouched.
   Fitzwater would not comment on details of the package, but said
White House officials had ``had a lot of discussions'' with
congressional Republicans.
   ``They know our thinking and we know theirs and we've talked
about a lot of ideas,'' he said.
   Failing an agreement, ``there is a possibility that the
president would ask the Congress to stay,'' Fitzwater said, adding
that he assumed Bush also would cancel part of his three-week
vacation in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Postponing the recess ``is one of the options out there,''
Gephardt said.
   He said there were discussions Thursday of specific strategies
for higher taxes, including a proposal favored by some leading
Democrats to even out the tax code by raising taxes on the richest
Americans.
   Middle-income Americans are taxed at a rate of 33 percent, but
joint filers earning more than about $162,000 pay a lower 28
percent rate.
   ``We feel the tax code has become unprogressive and that the
middle class and the people below have been paying too much of
their share,'' Gephardt said. ``We would like to change those
things.''
   The administration has opposed such a tax-law change.

<HEAD>Boeing Doubles Quarterly Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. on Thursday reported record
second-quarter profits double those of a year earlier, saying its
soaring commercial jet sales and healthier profit margins offset
major losses in its defense business.
   Boeing, the world's largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft,
had profits of $387 million, or $1.12 a share, for the quarter
ended June 30. That's up 98.5 percent from the $195 million, or 57
cents a share, in second-quarter 1989. Sales were up 37.4 percent,
from $5.07 billion to $6.97 billion.
   Frank Shrontz, Boeing chairman and chief executive officer,
attributed the profit growth to higher commercial aircraft sales
and operating margins.
   Boeing has had five consecutive years of record jetliner orders,
which are now translating into record sales. All seven of its
current aircraft models also are well into production and past the
expensive development and start-up phases. The company has steadily
boosted its production to where it now averages better than one
plane a day.
   For the first six months of 1990, net earnings were a record
$689 million, or $1.99 a share, up 93.5 percent from $356 million,
or $1.03 a share, for the first half of 1989. Sales rose 47.7
percent, from $9.07 billion to $13.4 billion.
   Boeing changed its accounting for income taxes in 1989, which
resulted in a one-time addition of $298 million or 86 cents per
share in net earnings in first-quarter 1989. Including that
restatement, first-half 1989 earnings were $654 million or $1.89 a
share.
   For first-half 1990, Boeing turned out 186 planes, including 37
747 jumbo jets, each of which are worth about $125 million. That
compares with 148 planes in the first half of 1989, including just
13 747s. Boeing introduced its new 747-400 in early 1989.
   Commercial sales totaled about $10.2 billion in the first six
months of 1990, while defense and space sales totaled $2.95
billion, up $329 million from the same period of 1989.
   But Shrontz said troubles with defense programs and pressures to
cut military spending ``will result in a significant 1990 operating
loss'' for space and military business.
   ``Technical, cost and schedule problems on certain U.S.
government developmental and production programs have not been
fully resolved,'' Shrontz said, including problems with the
Advanced Tactical Fighter, or ATF. Boeing is developing a version
of the 21st century jet with Lockheed and General Dynamics.
   Boeing did not release quarterly profits or losses for its
commercial or defense segments, said spokesman Paul Binder. Last
year, however, defense and space lost $474 million.
   The company is trying to save money by streamlining its defense
and space segments. But it is a participant in a number of programs
in danger of being cut, including the B-2 stealth bomber, V-22
tilt-rotor aircraft, the ATF, the space station and the Army's
proposed light helicopter.
   Boeing did manage to gain a defense contract in the second
quarter, to develop a tactical derivative of the new short-range
attack missile it is developing for the Air Force.
   Boeing charged $354 million to earnings for research and
development in the first half of 1990 and plans to spend another
$400 million on R&amp;D the rest of the year.
   It had $207 million in other business in first-half 1990,
including the sale of a 15 percent interest in Peabody Holding Co.
   Shrontz repeated his earlier forecast of a record $27 billion in
total sales for 1990.
   Boeing had a total backlog of firm orders at June 30 of $84.3
billion, up from $80.6 billion a year earlier. Of that total, $78.1
billion was for commercial customers, for 1,862 announced aircraft
orders.
   Fifteen customers announced orders for 128 jetliners and five de
Havilland commuter planes in the second quarter, worth a total
$11.5 billion.
   Boeing is negotiating with airlines to obtain orders to launch
its proposed new 777 twinjet. The plane would seat 300-350
passengers.
   Shrontz said Boeing had cash and short-term investments of $3.61
billion on June 30, double the $1.86 billion on Dec. 31.

<HEAD>Disney Third-Quarter Net Earnings Up 23 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walt Disney Co. third-quarter profits
rose 23 percent, with a big lift from its movie business thanks to
``Pretty Woman'' in theaters and ``The Little Mermaid'' on home
video.
   Disney also reported Thursday that profits rose 21 percent for
the nine months ending June 30, keeping the entertainment company
on track for its goal of 20 percent profit growth during each of
the next five years.
   Revenues grew even faster, 32 percent for the April-June quarter
and 27 percent for the nine months.
   For the quarter, Disney earned $238.4 million, or $1.75 per
share, on revenue of $1.54 billion, compared with a profit of
$193.3 million, or $1.40 per share, on revenue of $1.17 billion a
year earlier.
   For the nine months, Disney earned $591.3 million, or $4.29 per
share, on revenue of $4.13 billion, compared with net income of
$490.6 million, $3.56 per share, on revenue of $3.25 billion in the
first nine months of the 1989 fiscal year.
   Since Chief Executive Michael D. Eisner and President Frank G.
Wells took control in 1984, yearly revenues have tripled to $4.6
billion last year and profits have increased seven times, to $703
million.
   Their new goals, reiterated last week by Wells during an
interview at Disneyland, are to keep profits chugging upward at a
20 percent clip. For all of 1989, they rose 35 percent.
   Eisner and Wells, in a joint statement Thursday, said revenue
and operating income was up at all three Disney divisions: theme
parks and resorts, consumer products and filmed entertainment.
   In the first category, record attendance, higher per-capita
guest spending, expanded resort operations and benefit from
Disney's 49 percent stake in Eurodisneyland pushed quarterly
operating income up 14 percent to $289 million and revenue up 18
percent to $858 million.
   Licensing of ``Dick Tracy'' and ``Little Mermaid'' items helped
the consumer products division, where operating income was up 18
percent to $46 million for the quarter and revenue shot up 47
percent to $125 million.
   Filmed entertainment revenue rose 57 percent to $556 million.
Operating income was up 35 percent to $73 million. Disney said the
strong performance was led by home video sales of the Oscar-winning
``Mermaid'' and theatrical release of ``Pretty Woman,'' Hollywood's
highest-grossing film this year.
   Next quarter's results should get a boost from ``Dick Tracy,''
which was released in late June, and ``Arachnophobia,'' the killer
spider thriller from Disney's new Hollywood Pictures studio, which
Wells has predicted will be one of the summer's biggest smashes.

<HEAD>Major Oil Companies Report Mixed Earnings</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with Pennzoil results.</NOTE>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A drop in crude oil prices worked to depress earnings at Texaco
Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co. during the second quarter, but
Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. managed to improve results during the
period, the companies reported Tuesday.
   Though relatively strong during the year's first quarter, crude
oil prices fell an average of $4 a barrel in the subsequent quarter
because of worldwide oversupply. As a result, Texaco's profits
during the period slipped 4 percent, while Phillips reported a 47
percent tumble in net income.
   Several other major oil companies have reported lower earnings
due to lower crude prices, including Atlantic Richfield Co., Amoco,
and Amerada Hess Corp.
   But Mobil, the nation's second-largest oil concern, reported a
24 percent jump in net income, largely due to special factors, and
profits at Chevron were up a sharp 60 percent.
   Pennzoil Co. reported a 96 percent drop in profits, blaming the
sale of short-term securities and purchase of Chevron common stock
and restructuring charges in the second quarter of 1990. The
company also said a one-time gain recorded in last year's second
quarter contributed to the steep drop.

<HEAD>Mobil Corp.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Mobil estimated net income for the second quarter at $498
million, or $1.19 a share, up from $401 million, or 98 cents a
share a year earlier. The 1990 quarter got a $182 million boost
from the sale of a 5 percent stake in a North Sea oil field and the
sale of Mobil's refining and fuels marketing business in Italy.
   Revenue for the period was $13.8 billion, off 1 percent from $14
billion in the year-ago period.
   Mobil Chairman Allen E. Murray said excluding special items,
petroleum operations were slightly lower than a year earlier, and
stronger refining margins did not offset sharply lower crude oil
prices. The company's chemical operations also reported lower
results.
   For the first half, Mobil estimated net earnings at $898
million, or $2.13 a share, up 8 percent from $830 million, or $2.02
a share in the first half of 1989. Excluding special items,
first-half earnings of $856 million were down $114 million from the
year-ago level.
   Revenue for the period increased 3 percent to $28.9 billion,
from $28.1 billion in the first half of 1989.

   Texaco, the nation's third-largest oil company, said net income
during the quarter totaled $353 million, or $1.26 a share, down
from $366 million, or $1.39 a share a year ago.
   Revenue rose 3 percent to $8.72 billion, from $8.45 billion a
year ago largely because of higher crude and oil product sales
volumes.
   In addition to lower crude prices during the second quarter,
natural gas prices also fell and petrochemical results were
``significantly lower ... because of oversupply and reduced
demand,'' Texaco Chief Executive and President James W. Kinnear
said in a statement from the company's White Plains, N.Y.,
headquarters.
   For the year's first half, Texaco reported net income of $681
million, or $2.41 a share, down 63 percent from $1.82 billion, or
$7.19 a share in the year-ago period, which included a $1.19
billion gain from the sale of Texaco Canada Inc. Without the gain,
net income was up 8 percent, the company said.

$18.06 billion.

company said net income totaled $1.12 billion, or $3.16 a share, up
56 percent from $717 million, or $2.09 a share in the 1989 first

<HEAD>Takeover Specialist Gets 16 Months to Four Years on Larceny and
Tax Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald C. Carter, the takeover specialist who
pleaded guilty to stealing $1 million from clients in March, was
sentenced to 16 months to four years in state prison.
   Carter, 41, was also ordered to pay a $50,000 fine and put $1
million in a fund to compensate his victims. Acting New York
Supreme Court Justice George F. Roberts handed down the sentence
Wednesday.
   The firm Carter started in 1974, the Carter Organization, agreed
to forfeit $1 million to New York state, which will make it
available to those who can prove they were defrauded.
   Carter sold the firm, now doing business as Quorum
Communications Inc., to the VPI Group PLC, a British public
relations firm, in 1987 for $76 million.
   Ronald Goldstock, director of the New York State Organized Crime
Task Force, which headed the Carter investigation, said that
between 1984 and 1989 Carter routinely billed his clients for
non-existent or inflated expenses. When questioned about the
expenses, Carter supplied fraudulent documentation to justify them,
Goldstock said.
   The corporate clients he was said to have defrauded included
Union Carbide Corp., Shell Oil, Caesars World Inc., UNUM, an
insurance company, and MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Group Inc., which owns
the Revlon cosmetics company.
   Carter pleaded guilty March 20 to grand larceny and filing a
false and fradulent personal income tax return.
