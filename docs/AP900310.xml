   A man who returned more than $50,000 after
it fell from an armored car onto a busy highway said Friday his
good deed has paid dividends.
   ``A lot of good tings have happened to me in the past couple
years. ... But I'm the same person I always was,'' said Melvin
Kiser. ``I think people like to look at the positive and expand on
that, but I'm just average.''
   Kiser was among honorees at a luncheon to mark the end of a
14-month campaign by the city's Commission on Ethics and Values to
make honesty a citywide policy.
   Kiser gained national attention after he returned money that
spilled on Interstate 71 near downtown Columbus in October 1987. He
even portrayed himself in a television advertisement for Miller
beer.
   He said he returned the money out of his admiration for a famous
good guy _ movie star John Wayne.
   ``I was always a fan of John Wayne and still am,'' said Kiser,
an Ohio Bell employee.
   Kiser's honesty was rewarded with more than fame. The armored
car company gave him more than $5,000, and then there's pay for the
Miller ad.
   Miller spokeswoman Beverly Jurkowski said Kiser didn't ask to be
paid, but had to be given a standard union rate for actors. She
said he made between $5,000 and $10,000, but was unable to give the
exact amount.
   ``He was a superb example of the Miller High Life campaign
saluting people who do the right thing or make a decision in a
difficult situation,'' Ms. Jurkowski said of Kiser.
   In the commercial, Kiser is seen shooting pool in a bar with
friends while telling them about the armored car incident. A man
walks past him, and a $20 bill falls to Kiser's feet. Kiser picks
up the bill and asks, ``Why me?''
   The city's Commission on Ethics and Values was formed after the
rear door of Metropolitan Armored Car Inc. truck swung open,
dumping an estimated $1 million on a downtown freeway. Police
estimate some 200 people converged on the highway, scooping up
cash, while the truck continued north.
   Several people returned money they found, but police said
Kiser's return of more than $50,000 represented the largest single
amount. Police refused to say exactly how much money was lost or
returned.
   The city's ``Take an Honest Look'' campaign was headed by Jeb
Stuart Magruder, the former Watergate conspirator who is now a
Presbyterian minister in suburban Marble Cliff.
   Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, a candidate for governor of Georgia,
was the featured speaker at Friday's luncheon.
   At a news conference, Young said the honesty campaign was
``reaffirming and reminding us of those values that have really
made this a great nation.''
   Also honored at the luncheon were Sandy Pittman, of Columbus a
bank employee who turned in a bag of unused state lottery tickets
last July, and six local students whose essays on honesty were
judged best in a citywide competition.

   The government says it is ready to consider
banning a dangerous breed of dog called ``bandog'' _ a cross
between a pit bull terrier and a bigger breed, such as a rottweiler.
   The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
described the 130-pound dogs as ``Darwinian nightmares'' capable of
killing any human being in a one-to-one fight.
   Asked about a possible ban, Home Secretary David Waddington said
Friday: ``I'm prepared to look at anything. I think it's a very,
very serious situation.''
   He said Britain strengthened legislation governing dangerous
breeds last summer so courts now can order dangerous animals
destroyed.
   ``But certainly one has got to look to see if the law is tough
enough to give sufficient protection to the public against people
who take around streets of the land these terribly fierce dogs,''
he said.
   He said there was a problem in naming certain breeds of dog in
legislation because other breeds could then be developed.

<TEXT>
   Forty-five years after Communist
authorities banned it, the magazine of the Democratic Party of
Yugoslavia reappeared on Belgrade newsstands.
   The front-page editorial in Friday's editions of Demokratija
declared: ``Democracy means discussion _ the truth has many
different faces and cannot belong to one man or one party alone.''
   A Democratic official, Djurdje Ninkovic, said ``no consent for
the publication ... was demanded or obtained from the authorities.''
   He said the first issue had been financed by donations gathered
at a recent party convention. About 22,000 copies were printed, he
said.
   The fortnightly was reborn in a new political climate that has
swept Eastern Europe. Yugoslavia's ruling Communists have adopted
economic reforms and are debating political changes as well.
   Demokratija was the sole opposition publication in Yugoslavia
after the Communist takeover in 1945. But it was able to print only
seven issues because the government-controlled trade union refused
to publish ``capitalist lies.''
   It was banned after Communist activists organized attacks on
distributors and burned copies.

<TEXT>
   Amnesty International appealed to Indonesia not to
execute six political prisoners who have been jailed more than 20
years for participation in a 1965 coup attempt.
   In a letter to President Suharto made public Friday, the human
rights group's secretary-general, Ian Martin, said Amnesty
International had received reports that appeals for clemency had
been rejected.
   He said his London-based organization had heard the Suharto
government was to execute Ruslan Widjayasastra, Sukatno, Iskandar
Subekti, Asep Suryaman, I Bungkus and Marsudi on Sunday.
   Their executions would bring to 32 the number of prisoners slain
since 1985, compared with four in the preceding 10 years, he said.
   Four other prisoners accused of involvement in the 1965 coup
attempt were executed Feb. 13 after more than 24 years in jail.
   Martin said Amnesty International was concerned ``that it is
political prisoners who have been the principal victims of these
judicial killings.''
   In the letter released to the news media, Martin said the six
elderly prisoners had been convicted of membership in the Communist
Party of Indonesia and of involvement in the failed coup in 1965.
   The attempt to depose President Sukarno began Sept. 30, 1965. It
was crushed within 48 hours by troops led by Suharto, then a
major-general.
   In the crackdown that followed, up to 500,000 people were
killed. More than half a million people were detained before calm
was restored in March 1966 and Suharto took power from Sukarno.

<TEXT>
   NEW YORK (AP) The Directors Guild of America has reached
tentative agreement with ABC and NBC on a three-year contract
covering about 275 guild members at the networks, according to
union and network officials.
   The new contract, to succeed one that expires on June 30, still
must be approved by the guild's national board, and then submitted
to guild membership for ratification.
   In addition to staff members and free-lance employees at ABC and
NBC, the agreement covers guild members at facilities the networks
own here and in Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
   The proposed pact would boost salaries by 5 percent this July,
with another 5 per cent increase beginning on Jan. 1, 1992,
according to a statement issued Friday by the guild and the two
networks.
   The guild still is negotiating a new contract with CBS, said
Chuck Warn, a guild spokesman in Los Angeles.

   The ever-candid material girl Madonna says she

flights of fancy that her relationship with him could be an
enduring one.
   ``Sometimes I'm cynical and pragmatic and think it will last as

``Then I have moments when I'm really romantic and I think, `We're

   The singer and actress said her moments of doubt are short-lived.
   ``He's been with the world's most beautiful, most glamorous,

   Mayor Tom Bradley's daughter is serving a
60-day jail term for drunken driving in quarters separate from
other inmates at the Sybil Brand Institute for Women.
   Phyllis Bradley, 44, surrendered on Thursday, a day before she
was due to begin her term, to avoid publicity, said sheriff's Lt.
Charles Jackson.
   ``She is in separate housing because of the notoriety she would
have attracted had she been identified,'' Jackson said. ``However,
she is receiving no special privileges.''
   A call made to the mayor's office for comment was not
immediately returned.
   Ms. Bradley, who has a history of drug abuse problems, was
sentenced in February by Municipal Court Commissioner Mitchell
Green. Green also ordered her to spend 30 days picking up trash
along freeways and to pay a $1,000 fine.
   She was arrested in December after making an illegal U-turn. Her
blood alcohol level was found to be .19 percent, over the legal
limit at the time of .10 percent. The limit now is .08 percent.
   Ms. Bradley was placed on five years probation and was
instructed to spend one year in a rehabilitation program, while
using her car only to drive to work and to attend the program.

   Five police intelligence officers were
released early Saturday after Kashmiri Moslem separatists pulled
them from a jeep at gunpoint the day before, a state governor said.
   On Friday, a Cabinet minister, acknowledging the Moslem
rebellion had reached an ``unprecedented point,'' said the
government was opening negotiations with the separatists.
   The governor said the five men were released unharmed after
government loudspeakers blared all-night warnings that ``strong
action'' would be taken if the kidnapped officers were not freed.
   ``Our approach of firmness in dealing with the terrorists
worked,'' said Gov. Jagmohan of Jammu-Kashmir state. He said the
five men, members of the Jammu-Kashmir state police intelligence
branch, re-appeared before sunrise in the same area they were
abducted Friday night.
   No claims of responsibility or demands were made on behalf of
the abductors.
   The five men had been in a jeep patrolling a congested
residential area in the heart of Srinagar, core of the movement
demanding mostly Moslem Kashmir's independence from predominantly
Hindu India.
   A curfew was in effect, but a crowd surrounded the intelligence
officers' jeep, Jagmohan said. He said three young men took the
officers from the jeep at gunpoint and set fire to the vehicle.
   Jagmohan had said Friday that only four agents were missing. The
agency United News of India had said the missing agents working in
security units for senior government officials.
   Earlier Friday, Railway Minister George Fernandes told reporters
the government was opening talks with the separatists.
   ``It is too early to say what shape the dialogue will take, but
at least the process has begun,'' he said.
   Fernandes, selected by the government of Prime Minister V.P.
Singh to initiate the talks, said he was meeting the ``right
people'' through intermediaries. But, he said, ``we have a tough
job here.''
   Islamic militants have been fighting for secession of
Jammu-Kashmir state from India for the last four decades. The
latest round of violence began Jan. 20 after a government crackdown
on the militants. At least 173 people have been killed and hundreds
injured since then.
   A high-level political delegation, comprising leaders of all
major parties, visited Srinagar on Thursday to assess the
situation. The team returned to New Delhi on Friday but Fernandes,
who was part of the delegation, stayed back, apparently to initiate
the dialogue.
   Srinagar is summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state.
   ``The mood of the people is very obvious. The campaign for
secession has reached an unprecedented point,'' he said Friday.
   It was not known who the government would negotiate with. The
militants said earlier they will not negotiate their demand for
independence.
   In neighboring Pakistan-held Kashmir, about 500 demonstrators
demanded self-determination for their brethren in India during a
protest march Friday to a Pakistani military checkpoint along the
border.
   Protesters shouted ``Death to V.P. Singh!'' and ``Indian dogs,
go home!'' but no violence was reported.
   Kashmir, once a fabled tourist area, is in far northern India,
about 400 miles north of New Delhi.
   It has been under dispute between India and Pakistan since 1948,
when the Hindu ruler of the former princely state decided to merge
with India. Since then, Moslem-dominated Pakistan and India have
twice gone to war over the region.
   The U.S. State Department on Friday warned Americans to avoid
Indian Airlines flights to Srinagar because of the possibility of
terrorist attacks. It said in a statement the warning was prompted
by posters that appeared in the Srinagar area telling people not to
take the airline's flights to the city.

<HEAD>Terror Commission Looks at Impact of Moscow Embassy Notice</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A presidential commission is trying to find
out how many people changed travel plans when the U.S. Embassy in
Moscow disseminated a terrorism warning before the 1988 bombing of
Pan American Flight 103.
   Two embassy witnesses testified under oath Friday that a notice
from the Federal Aviation Administration of bomb threats against
Pan Am flights en route to the United States was posted in several
places around the diplomatic compound and outside and also was sent
to Soviet officials.
   The State Department previously acknowledged only that the
notice was improperly posted in the embassy a week before Flight
103 blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people on Dec.
21, 1988.
   Officials said the posting violated a policy against notifying
government personnel when others are not told of a threat.
   The embassy notice said employees were left to their own
discretion on whether to change travel plans, but it noted they
still were required to fly on an American airline. Pan Am was the
only U.S. carrier serving Moscow, although other airlines could be
used from Europe to the United States.
   Raymond F. Smith, who was acting deputy chief of mission in
Moscow at the time, told the Presidential Commission on Aviation
Security and Terrorism that he felt a ``moral obligation to let
people know'' about the threat against Pan Am flights between
Frankfurt, West Germany, and the United States.
   ``I said to myself, would I want my own family to take the
information into account, and the answer was yes,'' Smith said,
justifying the decision to inform all embassy personnel and other
people who might fly of the threat.
   Smith said he knew of no other embassy that disseminated the
notice publicly. State Department officials have said the threat
turned out to be a hoax originating in Helsinki, Finland.
   Embassy officials decided in a top-level staff meeting to give
the notice the widest distribution possible, Smith and embassy
security officer Mark A. Sanna testified.
   At Friday's hearing, the commission disclosed a telex message
from Pan Am's Moscow office saying that 80 percent of the airline's
Moscow passengers were changing their bookings as a result of the
posted threat.
   But Jennifer S. Young, the airline's former Moscow manager who
sent the telex, testified that she had no direct knowledge of any
cancellations and used the 80 percent figure to give her telex some
impact because she needed advice on what to tell travelers.
   Ms. Young said a part-time reservations clerk at Pan Am's office
in the U.S. Embassy had told her there were several inquiries about
the notice and she got the impression there also were cancellations.
   Commission Chairwoman Ann McLaughlin said the panel staff has
yet to find hard evidence of any changes in bookings as a result of
the threat but has asked Pan Am for passenger data and is
continuing its investigation.
   Relatives of some of the victims of the Flight 103 bombing have
questioned the fact that the plane, a Boeing 747 jumbo jet, had
more than 160 empty seats even though the flight was during a busy
holiday period. They say they believe government personnel
cancelled because of the selective warning.

<HEAD>Idaho House Approves Toughest Anti-Abortion Bill Yet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The state House approved a bill that would
outlaw abortion as a method of birth control and provide the
nation's strongest challenge to a 1973 Supreme Court ruling
legalizing abortion.
   ``We're really excited,'' Nancy Myers, a spokeswoman for
National Right to Life Committee in Washington, D.C., said after
Friday's 47-36 vote. ``We consider it to be extremely significant.''
   The measure was forwarded to the Senate after more than three
hours of debate before a gallery packed with activists from both
sides of the issue.
   The bill could come to a final Senate floor vote as early as
Friday, and opponents said it stood a good chance of passing. The
GOP controls both houses of the Legislature.
   The bill, like legislation rejected recently in Minnesota and
Utah, would outlaw abortion as a method of birth control. It would
allow abortions only in cases of rape, incest, ``profound and
irremediable'' fetal disabilities, or to save the life or prevent
``severe and long-lasting physical health damage'' to the mother.
   Sponsors contend that would prevent more than 90 percent of some
1,600 abortions performed each year in Idaho.
   Penalties of up to $10,000 for a first offense, $30,000 for a
second and $50,000 for each additional violation could be assessed
against any physician performing or attempting to perform an
abortion. Women undergoing the procedure would not be legally
responsible.
   Gov. Cecil Andrus has yet to comment on the bill, but he has
come out strongly against abortion in most cases.
   Along with a 1989 Pennsylvania law, which has been partially
blocked by a federal court injunction, the Idaho bill would be the
most restrictive in the nation, according to its sponsors and the
National Right to Life Committee.
   ``I'm just so proud that Idahoans are taking the lead in
returning protection to our unborn children,'' said Kerry
Uhlenkott, legislative coordinator for Right to Life of Idaho Inc.
``The Supreme Court is inviting us to send up legislation, and
that's what we're doing.''
   Advocates of legalized abortion were disappointed that
legislators ignored arguments the measure would fail to pass
constitutional muster, and that most Idaho residents want the
Legislature to stay out of the issue.
   ``I consistently heard the word `morality' used, always ascribed
to the life of the unborn,'' said Sally Trott of Freedom Means
Choice. ``I never heard it used in reference to the state's
obligation if it's going to coerce a woman to carry a pregnancy to
term.''
   On Thursday, the House approved and sent the Senate legislation
repealing the state's controversial ``trigger law,'' which sets
criminal penalties including prison terms up to five years both for
physicians and women receiving abortions.
   The statute would have taken effect only if the U.S. Supreme
Court completely overturned its 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision
legalizing abortion during the first two trimesters of pregnancy.
   After nearly 17 years of relative inactivity on abortion, Idaho
got back into the fray after last July's U.S. Supreme Court ruling
in a Missouri case, Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, which
gave states greater freedom to set limits on abortion.
   Opponents of the bill cited Richard Wilkins, a Brigham Young
University law professor who advised the Utah Legislature against
similar legislation.
   Wilkins opposes abortion, but contends the birth control bill
goes too far in challenging the Supreme Court's stand and would be
found unconstitutional on a number of grounds, including the test
that state restrictions should not impose an ``undue burden'' on
the mother.
   ``I am honestly and genuinely convinced that if we pass this
bill, it will hurt the pro-life movement, that it will be struck
down,'' said Democratic Rep. Patricia McDermott.
   But the bill's sponsors said it balances privacy concerns and
the state's responsibility to intervene.
   ``How can any act that involves the consent of one party, the
participation of a second and the destruction of a third be a
purely private matter?'' asked House Majority Leader Gary
Montgomery.

<HEAD>NASA Chief Sees Space Station Partnership Endangered by Cuts</HEAD>

   The United States risks losing its
international partners in the manned space station project if
Congress cuts back on the $2.6 billion requested for the project in
1991, NASA Administrator Richard H. Truly says.
   ``I think a major reduction would cause them to look very
seriously at our commitment to the project,'' Truly told the Senate
science, technology and space subcommittee Friday.
   The space station Freedom is part of the Bush administration's
$15.1 billion request for space programs in fiscal 1991, which
begins Oct. 1. The project, with European, Japanese and Canadian
partners, has been called the largest international research and
development enterprise ever undertaken.
   Relations with the project partners were strained by the United
States' decision last year to delay completion of construction for
one year without consulting them.
   The administration blamed the delay on congressional funding
cuts and design changes, even though the $200 million cut was half
as large as the administration first alleged.
   The European Space Agency complained that its projects were
given a back seat in the new plans.
   Truly said the project, scheduled for the first launch in five
years and permanent manning capability in 1999, is critical for
further exploration of space, especially the moon and Mars.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's budget
request is 23 percent higher than the 1990 spending plan, and the
administration expects to call for similar increases in 1992 and
1993.
   Subcommittee chairman Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., questioned the
feasibility of getting that much money.
   Gore also suggested NASA might be biting off more projects than
it can chew, leaving many open to the risk of underfunding during
critical years. Space projects tend to have lower startup costs.
The dollar amounts begin to balloon the farther along the projects
get.
   Gore also raised the issue of the space station when he asked
Truly whether the foreign partners were willing to ``sit still for
a further whittling away'' at the station project, a reference to
previous budget cuts.
   The 1991 request for the space station represents a 36 percent,
or $699 million, increase over the 1990 amount.
   ``This is a critical time for the space station,'' Truly said.
``The program is transitioning from the preliminary design to the
fabrication and testing of development hardware.''
   He said ``all major contractors are on board, as are many of the
subcontractors.''
   Addressing the overall NASA budget, Gore questioned the
administration's economic assumptions behind it: economic growth,
capital gains tax reduction, more user fees and lower interest
rates.
   ``There is still an air of unreality in the administration's
approach to the budget,'' Gore said.

   William R. Burleigh has been elected executive
vice president of the E.W. Scripps Co. and nominated to serve on
its board of directors, the communications company announced.
   Burleigh previously was senior vice president for newspapers and
publishing at Scripps.
   ``Bill Burleigh has proved himself to be one of the newspaper
industry's top managers,'' Lawrence A. Leser, Scripps president and
chief executive officer, said Friday. ``In his new role, he will
work closely with me on all facets of corporate affairs, as well as
continue to supervise our publishing operations.''
   The E.W. Scripps Co. operates 19 daily newspapers, nine
television stations, five radio stations and cable television
systems with 558,000 basic subscribers. The company also is a
worldwide syndicator and licenser of news features and comics.
   Burleigh was elected executive vice president Thursday.
Shareholders will elect directors at their May 14 annual meeting
here.
   Burleigh, 54, has been with Scripps more than 38 years,
beginning his career while still in high school as a part-time
sportswriter at The Evansville (Ind.) Press.
   After his service with the U.S. military and graduation from
Marquette University, Burleigh returned to the newspaper as a
reporter. He was named editor and president of the newspaper in
1975 and served as editor of The Cincinnati Post from 1977 to 1983.
   He joined the Scripps corporate staff in 1984 as vice president
and general editorial manager. In 1986, he was promoted to senior
vice president.
   Burleigh is a member of the board of directors of The Associated
Press, president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors
Foundation and on the advisory board of Marquette's College of
Communications.
   He and his wife, Anne, have three children.

<HEAD>Senators Shelve Clean Air Bill Until March 20</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate is taking a week-long respite from
its clean-air debate as lawmakers and the White House try to work
out an agreement on providing help to coal miners made jobless by
stricter pollution controls.
   Unable to resolve the dispute, Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, canceled plans Friday to continue consideration of the
clean air legislation into the weekend.
   The Senate, instead, adjourned for a previously scheduled recess
until March 20 when, Mitchell said, the bill will be the first
order of business.
   Senate leaders had been prepared Thursday to bring the coal
miner amendment, offered by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., to a vote,
but action was postponed when they grew uncertain about their
strength to defeat the proposal.
   The amendment is one of a string of proposed changes that would
significantly alter the compromise reached between Senate leaders
and the White House in private negotiations. Senate leaders have
said they would oppose any such amendments.
   Byrd described his proposal as a ``safety net'' for up to 5,000
miners who stand to lose their jobs because of tougher controls on
acid rain pollution, caused by emissions from coal-burning plants.
It would provide miners with up to four years of full or part
salary when their job loss is attributed to the new controls.
   Originally Byrd had sought assistance costing nearly $1.4
billion over six years, but he then cut that in half in a bid to
gain support. Nevertheless, the administration told Senate leaders
the measure was still too expensive.
   ``If this amendment is passed, it's over'' because President
Bush will not support a compromise bill that includes the coal
miner provision, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said
during debate Thursday night. ``The administration doesn't like
this amendment one bit and that would be an understatement.''
   Mitchell said Friday that negotiations were under way among
Senate leaders, Byrd and the administration to try to work out a
settlement.
   ``I'm willing to let the dice roll'' by putting the matter to a
vote, Byrd said.
   Mitchell had threatened all week to hold the senators in session
into today if necessary to work out key provisions of the clean air
legislation. But he canceled those plans Friday because of the
impasse over the coal miner assistance issue.
   Amendments still pending include several that would strengthen
the pollution controls, including those upon automobiles.
   Several of those measures, especially a call for a second round
of auto emission controls and broader alternative fuels programs,
are opposed by the administration.
   Mitchell said he hoped the Senate could move swiftly when it
returns March 20, because then ``we are going to stay on this bill
until we finish it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   U.S. military experts today arrived in
Laos to try to recover the remains of American airmen whose planes
crashed during the Vietnam War, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in
Bangkok said.
   The 16 Americans will work with Laotian specialists in
excavating the area in southern Laos where March 1989 survey
``found evidence that (it) may yield the remains of Americans
missing in action,'' said the spokesman, James Williams.
   The joint excavation will take 2-3 weeks, he said, quoting a
Pentagon statement. U.S. and Laotian specialists also will conduct
surveys at several other sites during this time, he said.
   The 16 Americans are from the U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution
Center and the Army Central Identification Laboratory, Hawaii-based
units entrusted with accounting for America's wartime missing.
   In January, another joint excavation in Communist Laos recovered
remains that are still being analyzed, Williams said.
   Williams said 2,304 Americans are listed as missing from the
Vietnam War, which also involved fighting in neighboring Laos and
Cambodia.
   Of those, 1,679 are missing in Vietnam, 537 in Laos, 82 in
Cambodia and six in coastal waters off China.
   On Tuesday, U.S. and Vietnamese specialists completed a joint
search in five northern Vietnamese provinces for information on 12
missing American airmen, the official Vietnam News Agency reported.
   It did not say if anything was found.

   The U.S. military is widening its role in the
war on drugs, but critics say the Pentagon may be battling a foe it
cannot defeat.
   ``American troops will be entering a quagmire more complex than
Vietnam,'' said Kevin Zeese, vice president of the Drug Policy
Foundation, a Washington think tank that emphasizes the economic
and social issues behind the drug problem.
   Zeese commented after the Defense Department announced Friday
that it was adding warships, aircraft, radar equipment, dog teams
and other military resources in the Atlantic, Pacific, Caribbean
and along the southern U.S. border.
   The plan greatly extends the military's involvement in efforts
to stem the flow of drugs into the United States and to help
Colombia, Bolivia and other Latin American countries combat their
drug cartels on land, sea and in the air.
   ``Deploying appropriate elements of the armed forces ... should,
over time, help reduce the flow of drugs into the country,''
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said in a written statement.
   Cheney, who did not attend a news briefing on the program, made
clear in his statement that the impetus for wider military
involvement in the drug war came from the White House, not the
Pentagon.
   ``President Bush gave the Defense Department a clear set of
marching orders when he issued his National Drug Control Strategy''
last September, Cheney said. ``These plans carry out those orders.''
   The Pentagon's civilian and military leaders had resisted
diverting military forces to the drug war during the Reagan
administration.
   Cheney's announcement won praise from some members of Congress.
   Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Select
Committee on Narcotics, applauded Cheney for providing an assurance
that no military people or resources would be used in a Latin
American country without that nation's approval.
   ``I am extremely pleased the military is becoming a full partner
in the war on drugs, as directed by Congress,'' Rangel said.
   Stephen M. Duncan, Cheney's coordinator of drug enforcement
policy, said the drug-fighting plan would cost nearly twice the
$450 million appropriated by Congress for Pentagon anti-drug
efforts this year. He said the services would have to ``cough up
out of their hide'' the extra funds.
   The administration has asked Congress to approve $1.2 billion in
Pentagon spending on the drug war next year.
   Duncan outlined the following plans for increased military
action in the drug war:
   _Four or five naval ships are being used exclusively for
tracking and stopping drug traffic in international waters in the
Caribbean and Atlantic. None had been dedicated to this use before
this year. More of the Air Force's Airborne Warning and Control
Systems, or AWACS, surveillance aircraft also will be used in the
Atlantic.
   _The U.S. Atlantic and Pacific commands each plan to use more
than eight classes of aircraft and six classes of ships for the
drug-interdiction strategy. The aircraft include P-3 Orions, F-4
Phantoms and F-14 Tomcats. Ships include destroyers, frigates,
aircraft carriers and amphibious and logistic support ships.
   _The North American Aerospace Defense Command will use a network
of 44 ground radars designed to warn of high-altitude penetrations
of U.S. airspace. It also will increase its patrol of the U.S.
southern border and coasts by using AWACS planes and 50 interceptor
alert aircraft positioned at 25 locations nationwide.
   _The Pacific Command will greatly increase its use of ships and
aircraft to provide intelligence data on drug trafficking. It also
will use military dog teams, when requested by civilian police
authorities, to help detect illegal drugs at air and sea ports of
entry.
   _The U.S. Southern Command in Panama will provide training and
other support to Latin American nations asking for help against
their drug cartels. It also will use a Caribbean Basin radar
network that consists of a series of early warning radars, some
already in place, to detect and monitor drug traffickers.
   Duncan refused to say how many U.S. troops will be used in Latin
America.

<HEAD>Fellow Captain Comes to Hazelwood's Defense</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   ANCHORAGE, Alaska _ Joseph Hazelwood had set up a ``very nice
maneuver'' and should not be faulted for leaving the bridge of the
Exxon Valdez before the tanker went aground, a veteran captain said.
   In testimony for the defense Friday, Shiras Walker of
Jacksonville, Fla., said he would have acted much as Hazelwood did
on the day of the nation's worst oil spill. Hazelwood did no wrong
in leaving the ship in the hands of the third mate after giving
instructions to avoid channel ice, Walker said.
   ``It was a very gentle turn. ... He was setting himself up for a
very nice maneuver around the ice,'' said Walker. ``He was never
putting his vessel in grave danger.''
   Walker, who commanded ships through the Valdez Narrows for nine
years and now works as a river pilot, rebutted earlier testimony
from prosecution witnesses on these key points:
   _ The third mate's lack of pilotage endorsement. Although Walker
obtained the Coast Guard endorsement required to pilot in Prince
William Sound, he said he understood the requirement for this
license had been waived whenever visibility was two miles or more.
   Exxon captain Andre Martineau, who testified before Walker,
agreed: ``At that point in time, there were so many vessels running
up there without pilotage that there didn't seem to be much point
in monitoring the pilotage requirements.''
   _ Coast Guard monitoring. Walker said he understood the Coast
Guard always kept an eye on tankers to avoid collisions and
groundings. If they noticed anything wrong, he said, ``they would
really give the pilots hell.'' Coast Guard monitors said they lost
sight of the Exxon Valdez on their radar and gave the ship no
warning.
   _ The 10 degree right rudder turn which was not executed,
causing the tanker to run aground. Walker said it is one of the
simplest commands for a helmsman to carry out. ``It's a very simple
thing. It's even easier than steering some cars.''
   _ Hazelwood's failure to sound a general alarm for the crew.
Walker said it would have created panic. ``I would have done
exactly what captain Hazelwood did.''
   _ Hazelwood's post-grounding behavior. ``I think he was really
thinking,'' Walker said of the skipper's orders to gather
information, lower lifeboats and check the engine room. ``It's
amazing. With all the crushing problems on him to be able to think
that quickly.''
   ``I've been through groundings,'' Walker said. ``The feeling is
equivalent to being punched in the stomach. And I'm talking about a
one-to-two barrel spill, not something of this magnitude. To bear
up under that _ it's amazing.''
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., faces up to 7\ years in
prison and $61,000 in fines if convicted of the four criminal
charges he faces.
   The Exxon Valdez went aground March 24, spilling almost 11
million gallons of Alaska crude oil into Prince William Sound,
polluting the rocky shore and killing countless birds, fish and
other widlife.
   A central issue confronting jurors is whether Hazelwood was
reckless when he allowed third mate Greg Cousins to take control of
the ship while the skipper went below. Hazelwood was the only
officer on board who had the Coast Guard pilotage endorsement.
   Walker said Hazelwood was not reckless, noting, ``He left proper
instructions with his mate.''
   Also Friday, Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone dismissed a
juror and replaced her with an alternate during a secret session
with lawyers for both sides. Johnstone refused to disclose why the
woman had been excused. ``It's not a big deal,'' he said.

Guyana jungle in 1978.
   Stoen, 52, a former prosecutor, also served as Jones' legal
adviser but the two parted ways a year before the Jonestown
tragedy. Jones held onto his son ``to show people what happens to
`traitors,''' Stoen said Friday.
   The primary problem facing his district, in the redwoods country
north of San Francisco, is over-cutting by the timber industry,
Stoen said.
   ``We must save timber jobs by cutting the harvest rate,'' he

   Oliver North says he lied repeatedly to
Congress after national security adviser John Poindexter told him
to ``take care of'' inquiries into whether he was secretly
assisting the Nicaraguan rebels.
   But ``nobody ever told me to lie to Congress,'' North testified
Friday at Poindexter's trial, insisting that he decided on his own
to make the false statements after his boss sent him to meet with
House Intelligence Committee members on Aug. 6, 1986.
   Poindexter watched intently while North spent the day on the
witness stand in U.S. District Court, reluctantly testifying
against his former boss on the National Security Council staff.
North, the government's first witness, returns Monday to face
questioning about the Iran initiative.
   Iran-Contra prosecutor Dan Webb led North through his
recollections of a conversation with Poindexter, in which North
said he didn't think it would be a ``very good idea'' to meet with
the congressmen.
   North testified at his own trial last year about the
conversation in some detail, but he said Friday he was unable to
remember much of his earlier testimony.
   Under prodding by Webb, North said he had ``a general
recollection'' of telling Poindexter that there were things that
could not be revealed to the congressmen and that meeting with them
would create ``vulnerability.''
   ``I didn't want to be in that predicament,'' said North.
   He recalled that Poindexter told him something like ``you can
handle it or you can take care of it. I do not remember the
specific preambular language on either side.''
   Asserting that neither Poindexter nor anyone else had ordered
him to tell falsehoods, North said, ``I didn't walk into the
meeting intending to lie.''
   He said he made false statements when he told the congressmen he
wasn't providing military advice to the Contra rebels, hadn't been
in frequent contact with Contra liaison Robert Owen and hadn't been
in touch with rebel supporter John Singlaub in 20 months.
   ``I recall deceiving them about the full measure of my
involvement,'' North testified.
   North balked when Webb showed him a computer message from
Poindexter sent several days after the meeting in which the
national security official told North, ``Well done.''
   North suggested that the message sent on the computer may not
have been a reference to his false statements to the congressmen.
   At that point, Webb pulled out North's testimony to the
congressional Iran-Contra committees on July 8, 1987. North told
that hearing that he informed Poindexter what he had told the
congressmen, and that in response his boss said, ``Well done.''
   ``Do you recall that?'' Webb asked North.
   ``I do not,'' North replied.
   ``Did that surprise you that you got a note saying `Well
done?''' Webb continued.
   ``Not particularly,'' said North.
   While defending himself at his trial last year, North was much
more emphatic in recalling the conversation in which Poindexter
directed him to meet with the congressmen.
   ``I said ... I don't think this is a very good idea,'' North
testified on April 7, 1989.
   ``I had told him ... that he and I both knew ... that there were
all kinds of things that just could not be revealed, that could not
be divulged, and that he and I both knew what they were,'' North
testified at his trial.
   North said one of the things was Saudi Arabia's aid to the
Contras, which President Reagan had admonished must never be
revealed.
   Poindexter's response, said North, was, ``You can handle it ...
you can take care of it. Not in the sense that it was going to be
unlawful, just in the sense, you can take care of it.''
   In his trial testimony, North went on to say that ``I felt like
a pawn in a chess game being played by giants.''
   Poindexter is accused of conspiracy, two counts of obstructing
Congress and two counts of making false statements for allegedly
concealing North's secret Contra resupply network and U.S.
involvement in a 1985 shipment of Hawk anti-aircraft missiles to
Iran.
   North is appealing his conviction on charges of conspiracy,
aiding and abetting an obstruction of Congress and accepting an
illegal gratuity.

   A transplant organ is only good for about four hours; doctors
arrived with one hour to spare, Deeb said.

<HEAD>Democrats Pressing Rich-Get-Richer Argument in Capital Gains Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats in Congress are zeroing in on the
rich-get-richer argument as they battle President Bush's proposal
to cut taxes on capital gains.
   Changes in federal tax laws since 1977 have shifted considerably
more of the tax burden away from the wealthiest taxpayers and a
capital-gains cut would worsen the inequity, the Congressional
Budget Office says in a new report.
   In releasing the study Friday, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.,
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, described as
``staggering'' the tax shift and the increases in incomes of the
richest Americans.
   The non-partisan CBO estimated that 59 percent of the
capital-gains tax cut would go to the richest 1 percent of
Americans, whose incomes average $162,000. The top 5 percent,
averaging almost $59,000, would get 85 percent of the reduction.
   Other analyses by CBO, the Ways and Means Committee staff and a
labor-financed group, Citizens for Tax Justice, released in recent
days reached the same conclusions.
   Senior aides to Rostenkowski said that without such analyses,
the heated debate over cutting taxes on capital gains _ which are
profits from the sale of investments _ would be conducted solely on
administration claims that the reduction would boost the economy
and lower the budget deficit.
   ``The administration is not raising the other issue: what has
happened to tax progressivity in the 1980s,'' said one aide, who
like others briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.
Progressivity refers to a tax system based on ability to pay.
   The aides acknowledged that Rostenkowski does not now have the
votes to defeat a capital-gains tax cut. Bush has proposed to lower
the current 28 percent and 33 percent tax rates on capital gains by
nearly one-third.
   Meanwhile, Rostenkowski carried his fight against the cut to a
convention of securities dealers in Boca Raton, Fla. He said the
proposal is neck-and-neck with a Social Security tax cut in the
race for dumbest idea of the year.
   ``I was left nearly speechless by this competition until I
finally decided to simply call both proposals political junk food
and just let them go at that,'' Rostenkowski said.
   Democratic leaders in the House and Senate are weighing how to
respond to a proposal by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., to
cut Social Security taxes in order to keep the government from
using surplus taxes to make the budget deficit look smaller than it
is.
   The Democratic response on that issue will be included in a
plan, expected soon, setting out the party's policy on a broad
array of tax and budget issues.
   Rostenkowski is getting the jump on his fellow Democratic
leaders. In an article written for Sunday's editions of The
Washington Post, he is expected to call once again for a sharp
increase in the gasoline tax and perhaps for higher taxes on
tobacco, alcohol and crude oil.
   The CBO report released Friday concluded basically that major
tax laws enacted in 1978 and 1981 cut taxes significantly for the
wealthiest Americans but not nearly so much for those at other
income levels.
   The conclusion is essentially the same as was reached in a study
released Citizens for Tax Justice. That study found that if the tax
laws were made as fair today as they were in 1977, all but the
richest 10 percent would pay less and the government would still
collect $67.5 billion a year more.
   The Bush administration prefers to point out that the richest
Americans are paying a greater share of the total tax burden than
they were in 1977. Congressional economists agree _ but say the
reason is that incomes of the wealthiest 10 percent have soared
during the same period.

   For the second time this week, hundreds of
thousands of tax refunds have been delayed by the Internal Revenue
Service's outdated computer system.
   The IRS said Friday that 171,000 returns filed into the Ogden,
Utah, service center from 25 Midwestern and Northwestern states
were delayed because of a faulty computer tape. That number
included 31,000 returns filed electronically.
   ``What this is going to mean is that these people who have filed
electronically will still get a refund within the two- or
three-week time frame promised, but it will be more toward the
end,'' said Ellen Murphy, IRS public affairs director. Filers of
paper returns have been getting refunds in five to six weeks.
   On Tuesday, the IRS said 53,000 electronic returns and as many
as 200,000 paper returns filed into the Cincinnati and Memphis
centers had been delayed two weeks because of a breakdown in the
transportation of several reels of computer tape.
   The IRS service-center computers used to process returns cannot
communicate with those at the Martinsburg, W.Va., center where
refunds are certified. Tapes from the service centers must be flown
to Washington National Airport and trucked from there to
Martinsburg.
   The Ogden service center tape containing data from returns filed
in late February was shipped to Martinsburg, where it was found to
be faulty.
   A backup tape was received at Martinsburg within 24 hours. But
since processing is done on a weekly basis, Ms. Murphy said,
refunds had to be delayed into the following week.
   Of 6,000 reels of tape processed this year, she said, about a
dozen have had to be reshipped because of faulty ``formatting'' or
other glitches.
   Through March 3, the IRS had received 38.6 million returns, up 3
percent from the 37.5 million in the same period last year.
Processing is up 15 percent, 25.3 million compared with 22 million
a year ago.
   Just under 3 million electronic returns have been received, a
281 percent increase over 777,000 at this time last year.
   The IRS expects about 110 million individual returns to be filed
this year.

<HEAD>Full-Scale Production at Plutonium Plant Not Likely Before Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department is aiming at a June
restart of production at its Rocky Flats, Colo., plant, the sole
supplier of plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons.
   The plant, 16 miles from Denver, has been closed since last
November. The department ordered safety and management
improvements, although it insists the facility poses no threat to
public health.
   On Friday, the department said it had approved a restart plan
submitted by EG&amp;G Inc., which operates Rocky Flats for the
government under contract.
   The restart plan calls for a phased resumption of plutonium
production by the end of June, with all six plutonium buildings
back in operation by the end of September.
   The announcement did not say exactly when full production would
be restored, although department officials said in late February
that it probably would be sometime this fall.
   Catherine Kaliniak, an Energy Department spokeswoman, said a
firmer estimate of the restart schedule dates might be announced as
early as April.
   Among the improvements that EG&amp;G said it will make before
resuming production are better procedures for verifying safety and
alarm systems, better training, new management oversight and an
environmental compliance review.
   Implementation of the improvements will be monitored by EG&amp;G
officials and department headquarters officials. Progress will be
assessed by an independent oversight board and then Energy
Secretary James D. Watkins will be asked to give the final OK for
restart.
   Rocky Flats has been plagued by a variety of operating and
waste-handling problems in recent years. Last June, the FBI raided
the facility in search of evidence of criminal violations of laws
governing the handling of radioactive wastes. A grand jury was
impaneled last August but no indictments have been returned.
   EG&amp;G, a longtime weapons industry contractor based in Wellesley,
Mass., officially took over Rocky Flats on Jan. 1 from Rockwell
International Corp., although EG&amp;G has been working on a
plant-improvement strategy since last September. Rockwell quit
operating the plant last September in a dispute with Watkins over
legal liability for environmental violations.

   Gov. Gaston Caperton offered to pay
teachers for the class they missed during a three-day walkout if
they end West Virginia's first teacher strike and return to schools
Monday.
   Leaders of the biggest union, the West Virginia Education
Association, declined to comment on Caperton's offer Friday.
   Bob Brown, executive director of the smaller West Virginia
Federation of Teachers said representatives of his 3,000-teacher
union were meeting today to discuss the proposal.
   Capterton had earlier refused to negotiate until teachers
returned to work. Attorney General Roger Tompkins on Thursday said
local school boards could suspend, fire or file criminal charges
against striking teachers.
   Education Secretary Steve Haid said it would be up to each of
the 55 county school boards whether to follow the governor's
recommendation of clemency and pay for the strike days, but he said
he expects all to comply.
   ``We're trying to create an atmosphere of cooperation,'' Haid
said.
   Caperton said negotiations on pay and benefits can begin once
the teachers return to work. He acknowledged that a pay raise will
require a tax increase, and Haid said a special legislative session
later this spring is possible.
   ``That's a very, very important conciliatory offer on the
governor's part, because I am sure there are a lot of people out
there who think it's overly generous,'' said Education Secretary
Steve Haid.
   The strike began Wednesday after the governor and legislative
leaders withdrew a 5 percent pay raise offer, saying the package
couldn't win legislative approval because the WVEA refused to say
it wouldn't strike.
   The WVEA says the average West Virginia teacher salary of
$21,904 ranks the state 49th in the nation, ahead only of
Mississippi. West Virginia teachers received a 5 percent pay raise
last month.
   The strike spread to 40 of the 55 counties Friday, and the state
Education Department said there was no class at all in 24 counties,
with five others reporting some schools closed and some open.
   West Virginia Education Association President Kayetta Meadows
said earlier Friday her 16,000-member organization was willing to
resume talks but was not ready ``at this time'' to go back to class.
   More than 1,000 striking teachers, most wearing bright red,
swarmed through the Capitol on Friday for the third straight day.
The teachers have begun wearing anything red _ from sweaters to
coats to hats _ as a symbol of unity, much as striking coal miners
wear camouflage.
   An additional 3,000 teachers in the state are not represented by
either union.

   Michelle Jones' ``crime'' of
planting unauthorized marigolds has brought her a $50 fine and
could result in summary execution by trimmer for the felonious

   She plunked down $6 for the yellow flowers and planted them
around a bottlebrush tree and a ficus tree in front of her
townhouse.
   ``I just thought it looked nice,'' said Jones.
   But she failed to get permission from the homeowners'

   It was a case of mistaken identity.
   A man dressed as a woman was arrested after his underwear,
stuffed with allegedly stolen women's clothing, fell around his
ankles and tripped him, police said.
   After leading a store manager, witness and police officer on a
chase through a parking lot, Darryl Willums, 23, was charged with
robbery for the theft of 14 clothing items worth $457.
   The manager had noticed a bulge under Willum's clothing and
several empty hangars in the Lerner's store and asked him not to
leave, said officer Dusty Cutler.
   But Willums threw some money at a clerk, shoved her out of the
way and ran from the store, Cutler said.
   Cutler said she was driving through the lot when she spotted the
manager and a witness chasing Willums, and joined the pursuit in
her cruiser.
   Willums fell when his clothing-filled drawers dropped to his
ankles, but he pulled off the undies and continued running,
throwing clothing from his purse as he went, Cutler said.
   Cutler said she finally cut Willums off with her car.

   A judge's ruling will allow
sheriffs to arrest shop owners for selling a rap album that
allegedly contains obscenities.
   Gov. Bob Martinez last month made an unsuccessful effort to get
state prosecutors to investigate the Miami rap group 2 Live Crew
over the lyrics in ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be.''
   Broward Circuit Judge Mel Grossman on Friday ruled there was
probable cause to believe the record was obscene, and therefore to
ban its sale in Broward County, north of Miami.
   A Fort Myers judge last month ordered the album pulled from the
shelves in Lee County, on the Gulf.
   Sales to juveniles would be punished as a felony, adults sales
as a misdemeanor, said Broward sheriff's spokesman Al Gordon.
   At Q Records and Tapes in Boca Raton, sales are up because of
the publicity the album is getting, night manager Pete Scharlatt
said.

<HEAD>Mongolian Leader Agrees To Consider Sweeping Political Changes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In a major victory for Mongolia's pro-democracy
movement, its Communist leader proposed a plebiscite for the
party-controlled legislature and called for a revamped party
Politburo, a foreign source said today.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said President Zhambyn Batmonh would
consider ousting the entire Politburo. Batmonh, also the party
chief, called for a party Central Committee meeting Monday.
   His televised address Friday came amid increasing pressure from
the 3-month-old reform movement and raised the odds Mongolia would
become Asia's first Communist country to undergo sweeping political
change.
   The events brought the wave of political reform to the doorstep
of China, which has crushed its own democracy movement last spring
with the army attack on protesters in Beijing.
   In his speech, Batmonh also appealed for opposition groups to
respect law and order and end a three-day hunger strike, said the
foreign source, speaking in a telephone interview from the
Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator.
   The source said the hunger strikers, gathered in a roped-off
area on the capital's central square, ended their fast Friday
night. There were about 30 participants at the end.
   A general strike proposed for today by demonstrators who
gathered in the square Friday was also likely to be called off in
response to the concessions made by Batmonh, the source said.
   Batmonh, a former university rector who took power in 1984, said
the Central Committee will consider calling a special party
congress.
   He said he hoped the meetings would result in the election of a
new ruling Politburo but did not say what kind of leaders he had in
mind.
   Monday's meeting will also take up the question of holding a
referendum on the Great People's Hural, which under Communist rule
has little power and is not directly elected. The party's 69-year
monopoly on power may also be on the agenda.
   The opposition, which first took to the streets in peaceful
demonstrations in December, complains that Mongolia is moving too
slowly in its version of perestroika, the Soviet word for
restructuring that is used to describe Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reform policies.
   Two newly formed opposition parties _ the Mongolian Democratic
Party and the Social Democratic Party _ have demanded the
resignation of the Politburo, the dissolution of the legislature
for new elections and recognition of a multiparty system.
   They and smaller opposition groups have also blamed the party
for the nation's economic stagnation and its heavy dependence on
Moscow. About 50,000 advisers and 60,000 troops are in Mongolia,
which lies between the Soviet Union and China.
   They say the Soviet Union doesn't pay enough for Mongolia's
natural resources and has saddled the nation of 2 million people
with a debt estimated by Western economists at $6 billion.
   The government, which began a cautious restructuring program in
1988, has taken a conciliatory stance toward the opposition demands
and has not interfered with street rallies, but has urged the
reformists against pressing too hard for rapid change.

<HEAD>150 Injured in Clashes Over Local Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supporters of rival candidates in local
council elections hurled rocks and homemade bombs at each other in
two southwestern cities, injuring at least 150 people, newspapers
said today.
   The clashes occurred Friday in Khulna, a river port city 85
miles southwest of Dhaka, and in Jessore, about 30 miles northwest
of Khulna.
   The independent Bengali newspaper Khabar said about 100 people
were injured in the Khulna clashes between supporters of two
candidates from President Hussain Muhammad Ershad's Jatiya Party.
   The trouble started when the two sets of supporters tried to
welcome Civil Aviation Minister Abdul Gaffar, who had come to
Khulna to address a public rally, the newspaper said. Both groups
claimed their candidate had the Jatiya Party's support.
   The local council elections, which traditionally are the most
violent in Bangladesh, are scheduled for March 14-25. They are
non-partisan, but clashes usually erupt along party lines because
local voters know the party affiliations of the technically
independent candidates.
   In Jessore, at least 50 people were injured in clashes between
supporters of the Jatiya Party and the Bangladesh Nationalist
Party, according to another independent Bengali daily, Bangla Bani.
The Nationalist Party, headed by Khaleda Zia, is one of the
country's biggest opposition parties.
   Last week, two people were shot to death in campaign violence in
the country's northwestern Pabna district.

<HEAD>San Diegans Seek Alternative to Cramped Lindbergh Field</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cramped and nerve-wracking airport and no
room to build a new one has San Diego in a tight spot.
   It's hard to imagine a more picturesque setting for an
international airport _ on a bayfront flanked by rolling hills,
glassy skyscrapers and the gray magnificence of a Navy fleet.
   But to pilots who are forced by downtown buildings to descend
steeply on approach to Lindbergh Field, the setting for the airport
serving the nation's sixth largest city is all wrong.
   ``It's the worst airport in the world,'' said Tom Carroll of the
Air Line Pilots Association.
   Some would call than an exaggeration, but a 1988 survey of 1,360
pilots found Lindbergh Field tied in fith place with Denver's
Singleton Airport as the least safe airport in the United States.
   Transportation planners and civic leaders, who eye the land that
Lindbergh sits on for downtown expansion, have spent 30 years
searching for a replacement. The most frequently discussed option
is to convert the Miramar Naval Air Station to a commercial or
joint-use airport.
   The Navy is adamantly opposed to any such plan.
   Unless an alternative is found by the turn of the century,
Lindbergh, built in 1928, could throw a wrench into the region's
robust economy.
   ``San Diego is running into an economic buzz saw if we wait any
longer,'' said Dan Pegg, president of the San Diego Economic
Development Corp.
   ``It's absolutely the toughest issue in San Diego,'' said Jack
Koerper, the director of special projects for the San Diego
Association of Governments, the regional planning agency conducting
the airport search.
   Squeezed onto 485 acres, Lindbergh is surrounded by San Diego
Bay, the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, businesses, residential areas
and rolling hills.
   ``One pilot likened it to landing in a shoebox,'' said Dick
Russell of the pilots association.
   ``I cannot and will not say it's unsafe, but I will say a pilot
flying into Lindbergh has to be on the ball at all times. There's
very little room for error,'' he said.
   Lindbergh handled 11 million people last year, but planners say
its saturation point may come in five to 10 years, the time to make
another airport operational. A new airport would have to serve
about 40 million passengers by 2050, aviation planners and civic
leaders say.
   Despite some 40 studies since 1960, no consensus has developed
on an alternative to Lindbergh.
   One proposal called for a binational airport on Otay Mesa, at
the Mexican border, but that would require the negotiation of
international agreements with Mexico.
   Other possibilities include a ``hub-and-spoke'' concept in which
a main airport would be constructed in Imperial Valley, some 100
miles to the east, with travelers shuttled to San Diego on smaller
planes or a high-speed train.
   An offshore, or ``floating'' airport also has been discussed.
   Around San Diego, options have dwindled as urban sprawl gobbled
undeveloped land.
   ``The only place that development hasn't preempted is Miramar
and that's because the Navy has preserved it,'' said county
supervisor Brian Bilbray.
   But the cost of replacing the air base, home to the ``Top Gun''
pilot school, would be $10 billion, said U.S. Rep. Bill Lowery,
R-San Diego.
   ``Miramar is not an option,'' said Lowery. ``The Navy's not just
said `no.' They've said, `Hell, no.' ''

<HEAD>Government Retraces Cross-Country Path of Radioactive Cargo
Shipment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials are trying to find dock workers, truck
drivers and others who may have been exposed to an intensely
radioactive pellet found in cargo shipped from Korea to California
to Massachusetts.
   ``There is no need for panic but there certainly is reason for
concern,'' Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman Karl Abraham
said Friday. ``People could have received significant exposure.''
   Abraham could not say how many people may have been exposed, nor
what radioactive isotope was involved. He said the radioactive
material was used for making X-ray-type pictures of welds,
structural steels and other industrial objects.
   The pellet _ the size of a pencil eraser _ was discovered lying
loose and unshielded in the bottom of a container that was supposed
to be empty. The container was being sent back to a manufacturer
for reuse in shipping new pellets, Abraham said.
   The pellet was in a shipment of containers that arrived in the
Boston area two weeks ago, more than a month after it was sent from
South Korea to Los Angeles for storage. The shipment then was
trucked from California to Pennsylvania, Maryland and
Massachusetts, Abraham said.
   A preliminary survey of the truck as it arrived at Amersham Inc.
of Burlington revealed some radioactivity and, on closer
examination, technicians found 1,500 times more radiation within
six inches of the source, Abraham said.
   He said tests 4 to 6 inches from the pellet found the level of
radiation to be 150 rems per hour, millions of times higher than
normal background levels.
   A rem is a measure of the estimated damage done to living tissue
by radiation; people generally receive about one-tenth of a rem, or
100 millirem, of radiation annually from natural sources, while the
average American is exposed to an annual dose of 77 millirem from
medical X-rays.
   U.S. Department of Transportation investigators were working
with the NRC to establish the shipment's route and track down dock
workers, cargo handlers, truck drivers, warehouse managers and
other people who may have been exposed to the pellet, Abraham said.

   In a brief White House ceremony Friday, Bush saluted both the

be an inspiration to women and minorities.
   ``The American dream is well and alive,'' Novello, the first
woman and first Hispanic to serve as surgeon general, said. ``Once
a dream, it is now my pledge: to be a good doctor for all who live
in this great country.''
   Novello, who succeeds C. Everett Koop, is a pediatrician who has

<HEAD>Senate Confirms Dunne for Civil Rights Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John R. Dunne has been unanimously confirmed
by the Senate to be assistant attorney general for civil rights,
filling a 15-month vacancy at the Justice Department.
   Dunne, a former New York state senator with little prior
involvement in civil rights issues, was confirmed by voice vote
Friday. The Senate Judiciary Committee had recommended Dunne the
day before despite criticism over his former memberships in clubs
that excluded women and stock holdings in a company that does
business in South Africa
   Dunne, 60, of Garden City, N.Y., was nominated in January for
the post, which had been vacant since December 1988 when William
Bradford Reynolds resigned.
   President Bush's first choice for the job, William C. Lucas of
Michigan, was rejected by the Judiciary Committee last August.
   Dunne played a minor role in Bush's New York campaign. He was a
New York state senator for 24 years, resigning last year after
losing a race for majority leader, and is a partner in the
Uniondale, N.Y., law firm of Rivkin, Radler, Dunne &amp; Bayh.
   Civil rights groups criticized Dunne's almost nonexistent civil
rights record, but none opposed his nomination.
   But Dune drew fire for having held longtime memberships in the
Fort Orange Club in Albany, N.Y., and the Garden City Golf Club on
Long Island, N.Y. The Fort Orange admitted women in 1988; the golf
club is still sex-segregated.

<HEAD>Administration Faulty On Delay for Lab Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Congress are criticizing the Bush
administration for missing the deadline for setting out regulations
to ensure the quality and accuracy of all medical laboratory tests.
   Lawmakers were not appeased by the Health Care Financing
Administration's announcement that final rules to bring 12,000
medical labs under uniform national testing standards would be
published next week and could take effect after a 60-day comment
period.
   By HCFA's own estimate, there are between 300,000 and 600,000
medical testing facilities _ including labs in physicians' offices,
employer health units, public health departments, blood banks and
public screening labs. Most of those would be covered by other
rules HCFA is drafting, but has not yet formally proposed.
   ``It is critical that all laboratories be regulated,'' Sen.
Brock Adams, D-Wash., said Friday at the joint hearing of the
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee and the Governmental
Affairs subcommittee on oversight of government management. ``Each
month the implementation ... is delayed, more cases of cancer go
undetected, more men and women receive erroneous laboratory reports
and more tragedies result.''
   Gail Wilensky, head of HCFA, told the lawmakers the rules
covering 12,000 labs that receive payments from Medicare and
Medicaid ``will make a tremendous difference'' in the way those
labs operate.
   She said those rules were already being drafted when Congress
passed a law in 1988 giving HCFA authority to regulate all testing
labs and directing the agency to have rules in place to implement
the law by Jan. 1, 1990.
   The main reason for the delay in meeting that deadline, she
said, was ``major unexpected dissension within the scientific
community'' over the amount of regulation various types of tests
should require.
   She said HCFA expected to propose rules to meet the 1988 law in
three stages.

terminals around the country for a driver killed last Saturday when
a bus crushed him against a wall in Redding, Calif.
   Members of the House Education and Labor Committee, meanwhile,
urged Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole to help resolve the dispute.
   A Greyhound bus carrying 29 passengers was hit by three shots
fired from a passing car. No one was injured in the shooting on
Interstate 71 about 25 miles southwest of Columbus, Ohio.
   The bullets struck a window near the driver, a window at the
back of the bus, and above the baggage bin, said Greyhound
spokeswoman Elizabeth Hale. The bus was operated by a driver from a
company that is helping Greyhound during the strike, she said.
   The striking union condemns violence, spokesman Nick Nichols
said.
   ``I hate to think the public would point the finger at any of
the people on the picket lines,'' Nichols said. ``I can tell you
that the union in no way condones violent acts or property damage.''
   In Pittsburgh, strikers claimed that police beat a striking
driver as officers struggled Thursday night with pickets who were
attempting to block a bus bound for Columbus, Ohio.
   Allegheny County sheriff Eugene Coon denied the charges of
brutality. The driver, 43-year-old Carl Masi, was charged with
inciting a riot, assault and other charges.
   A Greyhound bus en route from Las Vegas to Los Angeles was
stopped in the California desert and the passengers evacuated after
an anonymous caller reported hearing two men in a Las Vegas casino
restaurant talking about a bomb on the bus.
   A search with bomb-sniffing dogs on Interstate 15 outside Baker,
Calif., failed to find a bomb. The 24 passengers finished their
trip on another bus, said Nevada Highway Patrol trooper Philip Dart.
   Memorials and prayer services were held across the country
Friday for driver Bob Waterhouse, 59.
   In Cleveland, Mayor Michael R. White walked with several hundred
strikers and other labor activists in a rush-hour march in memory
of the dead driver. The protesters chanted ``Don't ride the bus''
as they walked by the bus terminal.
   ``We're here to show solidarity against union busting,'' said
Dan Strahinich of the Health Care Employees Union at a rally in
Hartford, Conn. ``That's what Greyhound is trying to do.''
   Federal mediators will meet next week with the union, and later
with company representatives, said Greyhound spokesman George
Gravley.
   ``There will absolutely be no talks whatsoever with Greyhound
this weekend,'' Gravley said. ``The federal mediators will let us
know sometime next week when they or the union want to talk to us
again.''
   A judge on Friday ordered limits on picketing by striking
Greyhound drivers at the company's depots in Oregon.
   Multnomah Circuit Judge Robert W. Redding directed that strikers
post no more than four pickets at any entrance to Greyhound's bus
depots. Non-picketing demonstrators were ordered to stay at least
120 feet from the company's property.
   The Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions, which
represents 6,300 drivers and more than 3,000 of Greyhound's office
and maintenance workers, went on strike March 2 when it failed to
reach agreement with the company on a three-year contract.
   Greyhound executive vice president P. Anthony Lannie said the
union's last offer would cost $205 million over three years, but
the union has said the pact would total less than the $63 million
the company has offered.

<HEAD>Police, US Troops Make House-to-House Sweep for Weapons, Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police and U.S. troops swept through
Panama City, seizing weapons and drugs and rounding up hundreds of
suspects to try to stop a crime wave.
   ``We want to get criminals off the street so our citizens can
once again walk around without fear of being held up,'' Vice
Minister of Government and Justice Ramon Lima said of the raids
Friday.
   Widespread looting broke out after U.S. forces invaded Dec. 20,
ousted Manuel Noriega and effectively disbanded his Defense Forces,
which served as police and army in the country.
   While widespread looting has ended, citizens complain of
robberies at stoplights, among other assaults, and say more
firearms are being used. Authorities say the murder rate has
quintupled.
   Lima said 760 people were arrested in the Friday raids, but they
yielded none of the large caches of weapons believed still hidden
by ex-members of the Defense Forces. He said many people apparently
were tipped off in advance and fled.
   ``We did not confiscate the amount of weapons we had expected,''
Lima told a news conference. He said police found 47 shotguns,
pistols and revolvers but no military weapons.
   Police also seized undisclosed amounts of cocaine, marijuana and
crack, he said.
   About 260 American soldiers took part in the operation ``in
support of the Panamanian police,'' William Ormsbee, a spokesman
for the U.S. Southern Command, said. The soldiers worked with about
400 Panamanian law enforcement officers, whom they have been
training in police work since the new civilian government abolished
the Defense Forces and created a police force.
   Many of the new policemen are former members of the Defense
Forces.
   Government officials express concern about hidden weapons they
fear could be used if Noriega's paramilitary organizations regroup.
   Capt. Leslie Loaiza, head of the operation, said the crime rate
is frightening.
   ``A few months ago, we had an average of five murders a month in
the capital,'' he said. ``We now have 30. We had an average of 240
crimes of different types every month. We now have more than
1,000.''
   Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon, who also is government
and justice minister, said there were no casualties in the
operation.
   Residents in the neighborhood of Curundu said they heard some
shooting.
   Arias said people in the neighborhoods had opened fire on law
enforcement officers earlier in the week, wounding two police.
Several vehicles heading for the canal area also were fired upon,
including some belonging to canal employees.
   About 12,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Panama, down from a
peak of 28,000 during the invasion.
   Noriega is being held in Miami for trial on drug trafficking and
money laundering charges.

   Redoubt Volcano spewed a column of
steam seven miles long on a day when three moderate earthquakes
jolted the region.
   Shallow tremors around the volcano late Friday led scientists at
the Alaska Volcano Observatory to keep a close watch on the
volcano. Scientists predicted another explosion in the next few
weeks as Redoubt rebuilds its dome.
   Accompanied by a rare lightning storm, Redoubt belched steam at
9:51 a.m. AST. The plume carried little ash and drifted mostly to
the north and northwest, away from population centers.
   A quake centered 50 miles beneath Redoubt and measuring 5.5 on
the Richter scale hit at 3:24 a.m. Friday, seismologists said.
   The second quake, at 8:03 a.m., was centered about 170 miles
southwest of Fairbanks and registered 5.5 on the Richter scale.
   A third quake, registering 5.2 and centered 65 miles southwest
of Anchorage, struck at 5:11 p.m. It shook office fixtures in
Anchorage but caused no apparent damage, authorities said.
   Redoubt, 115 miles southwest of Anchorage, began erupting in
mid-December after slumbering for 25 years.
   On Feb. 28, an eruption of abrasive ash reached Anchorage,
closing schools, forcing precautionary evacuations at an oil
terminal on the banks of the Drift River, which flows off the
volcano.

<HEAD>Hundreds Arrested After Coup Attempt; Najib Nearly Killed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State radio urged residents turn in
``traitors,'' and officials said scores of soldiers and employees
were detained after a coup attempt in which President Najib
narrowly escaped death.
   Sporadic clashes erupted in the capital Friday, three days after
the failed coup, although officials said the situation was
generally quiet.
   The location of the coup leader, Defense Minister Shah Nawaz
Tanai, remained unknown. Tanai teamed up with guerrillas from one
of the seven Moslem guerrilla groups battling Najib's Soviet-backed
government.
   The government said at least 56 people died and 200 were wounded
in Tuesday's coup attempt. It said 25 of the dead and half the
wounded were civilians.
   Damage to the city was severe. It appeared almost every window
was broken, indicating heavy bombing by renegade air force pilots.
Bombs had blasted several government buildings, including the
Presidential Palace.
   After a 9 p.m. curfew took effect Friday, security forces
arrested scores of people in a neighborhood populated mainly by
government employees, said a government official who lives in the
area.
   Radio Kabul urged all citizens to turn in ``traitors'' who it
said were hiding in houses throughout the capital.
   A government source said intelligence agents killed a military
officer believed loyal to the coup leader and arrested another near
the Presidential Palace Friday. One agent from the security
service, Khad, was wounded, the source said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   The status of the Shindand air base in southwest Herat province
was in question. A government official said the base had yet to
pledge loyalty to Najib.
   Lt. Col. Mohammad Hassan said he was on duty in the Presidential
Palace on Tuesday when four clusters of bombs landed on the
grounds, killing four soldiers from the presidential guards.
   A cluster of three small bombs landed yards from Najib's office,
he said. Najib, who had just eaten lunch, was at his desk, and the
explosion cracked walls and shattered glass, Hassan said.
   ``We are lucky our leader escaped death,'' he said.
   The Bakhtar news agency reported two more high-ranking officials
had been purged from the Central Committee of the ruling Democratic
People's Party of Afghanistan. At least nine top officials have
lost their jobs, including five from the Politburo, the most
powerful party body.
   Some of those removed from power were missing and apparently had
fled to neighboring Pakistan. Naqib Sameer, a government spokesman,
said some had been arrested, but he could not say which ones.
   Death sentences were widely expected for people found guilty of
supporting the attack. Najib established a special tribunal to hear
treason cases, and Bakhtar said punishment would be carried out
``in accordance with Afghan tradition.''
   Afghanistan accused Pakistan, which supports the anti-Najib
guerrillas, of masterminding the coup attempt and said it could not
tolerate such interference, Bakhtar said.
   Tanai, a Marxist hard-liner, was involved in the 1978 coup that
brought the Communists to power in Afghanistan. He disagreed with
Najib's attempts to make peace with the anti-Communist guerrillas
that began fighting the government 11 years ago.
   Despite this, Tanai this week teamed up with Hezb-i-Islami, one
of the most radical of the guerrilla groups. It had split from a
fractious coalition with the other six guerrilla groups and its
leader, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, backed the coup attempt.
   Hekmatyar and Tanai appeared to be linked only by their desire
to overthrow Najib.

   The Dalai Lama, addressing more than
10,000 Tibetan exiles on the 31st anniversary of a failed uprising
against Chinese rule, today said Tibetans must maintain the quest
for freedom.
   ``The positive changes that took place in Eastern Europe are a
clear indication that truth and desire for peace cannot remain
suppressed,'' said the Tibetan temporal and spiritual leader,
winner of the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize.
   The Dalai Lama, revered as a god-king by his followers, fled the
Tibetan capital of Lhasa on March 17, 1959, a week after the start
of the revolt against China. He made his way across the
snow-covered Himalayan mountains to India and eventually to
Dharmsala, which serves as the seat of his government-in-exile.
   ``Being political refugees, we must work towards political
freedom,'' he told the crowd gathered outside the Buddhist Thekchen
Choeling Temple. ``The Tibetans in Tibet have a greater
responsibility for the future of Tibet, especially the youngsters
and even those Tibetan cadres working for the Chinese.''
   After the ceremony at which the Tibetan flag was raised,
thousands of Tibetans and hundreds of foreigners who had traveled
here for the anniversary staged an five-mile march through this
town in the Himalayan foothills of northern India.
   In New Delhi, about 1,000 Tibetans burned a Chinese flag and
chanted their demands for freedom at India Gate, a soaring stone
arch commemmorating Indians who died in military service for their
colonial British rulers.
   Tibet, a rugged and remote enclave high in the Himalayas, was
invaded by Communist Chinese troops in 1950. China maintains Tibet
has traditionally been part of China, but the Dalai Lama and his
followers say Tibet has been independent for centuries.

<HEAD>Post-Dispatch Offers New Contract to Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The St. Louis Post-Dispatch submitted a new
contract to negotiators representing some 630 newsroom employees
who have been on a ``byline strike.''
   Post-Dispatch publisher Nicholas G. Penniman IV said Friday the
latest proposal was a response to concerns among employees. Most of
the newspaper's reporters and columnists have withheld their
bylines from stories since Wednesday.
   ``They said, `Tell us what you need to remain competitive and
give us a chance to vote.' And basically, that's what we did,''
Penniman said. ``We listened to our employees and put on the table
a very fair offer.''
   Herb Goodrick, executive secretary of The Newspaper Guild Local
47, said he would withhold comment until The Guild received a
written version.
   About 630 newsroom employees, including reporters, some editors,
photographers and advertising sales staffers, have been working
without a contract since the last one expired Feb. 28. The Guild is
the largest of 11 unions at the newspaper and one of six seeking a
new contract.
   The Post-Dispatch is owned by Pulitzer Publishing Co.
   Penniman said the new proposal was for three years and included
a 4 percent pay raise for each year and a $600 signing bonus. It
also eliminated many demands that Guild members had objected to in
the past few months.
   In October, The Guild rejected a proposal for a five-year
contract. It offered the same pay raise but called for
drug-testing, which the union said was unclearly defined, and a
two-tier wage system that would have meant lower wages for some new
employees.
   The company's subsequent contract offer included no wage
increases, a reduction in sick leave and vacation benefits, and a
number of other clauses denounced by the union.
   The paper said that offer was made because of a drop in
advertising and competition from the St. Louis Sun, a new daily
published by Ingersoll Publications that started up in September.

   Two small planes collided and crashed into
two homes, killing all three people aboard the planes and showering
a residential neighborhood with grisly debris.
   The planes, one trailing an advertising banner and the other
piloted by a trainer and his student, collided Friday at an
altitude of about 1,000 feet. They crashed into the houses about a
block apart in this suburb of Fort Lauderdale.
   Rought and Mary Ruth Blevins were eating dinner when one of the
planes hit their home.
   ``I saw the man lying in the plane,'' said Mary Ruth Blevins.
``I saw his arm sticking out. The plane was just crushed flat. I
was scared to death.''
   Next door, Jeannie Brooks, 22, was bringing in groceries and her
two small girls.
   ``It looked like confetti in the sky,'' she said. ``It looked
like it was coming down right on top of me. You fear for your kids,
just like yourself.''
   Miramar police officer Grace Cooper said there were no reports
of injuries to anyone on the ground. Fire trucks doused the
wreckage to prevent explosions and police sealed off several
streets, some littered with debris.
   The crash involved a Piper Super Cub coming from the southeast
and a westbound Cessna 152.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigator Jeff Kennedy
said the Cessna apparently was in a landing pattern for North Perry
Airport. He would not release other details.
   It was the latest of several fatal plane accidents in recent
years at North Perry, which serves small planes in the neighboring
city of Pembroke Pines.
   ``North Perry's a very busy training airport,'' said Jack
Barker, spokesman for the southern region of the Federal Aviation
Administration in Atlanta.
   The Piper pilot was identified as Jeffrey Hairfield, 29, an
employee of Aerial Sign Co. who had quit Eastern Airlines after the
start of the Machinists strike last year. The names of the Cessna
pilot and student were not released. Both were Japanese,
authorities said.

   A mysterious gas leak sent 110 people to area
hospitals after they complained of nausea and vomiting, officials
said.
   Among the victims of Friday's leak were 77 students from
Woodland Middle School in nearby Galena Park. Three remained in the
hospital overnight, officials said.
   ``Something made a lot of people sick out there, but we may
never find out what it was or where it came from,'' said Acting
Fire Capt. Bill Wilcox. ``It just blew through and disappeared.''
   Inspectors from the Harris County Pollution Control Bureau were
trying to determine whether the leak came from the Houston Ship
Channel or some other source.
   ``We strongly believe it was an ammonia-type gas and released
for a short amount of time because it dissipated. Or it could have
been a barge going down the channel,'' said Katherine Oates,
spokeswoman for the Galena Park Independent School District.
   About 700 students from the middle school and an elementary
school were evacuated, Ms. Oates said. Those not taken to hospitals
were transferred briefly to an area high school.
   Classes at both schools resumed Friday afternoon, she said.

<TEXT>
   Western European countries and human
rights organizations protested reported plans to execute six
prisoners jailed for decades after being convicted in connection
with a Communist coup attempt in 1965.
   The chief of the armed forces today rejected the criticism as
interference in Indonesia's domestic affairs.
   Lawyer Johannes C. Princen, director of the Institute for the
Defense of Human Rights, said the six were taken from their cells
in Jakarta's Cipinang Prison on March 5 and their families were
notified of the planned executions.
   The executions, by firing squad, of the men ranging in age from
53 to 70 were believed planned for today or Sunday, Princen said in
an interview today.
   In addition to Princen's organization, protests to the
government of President Suharto were lodged by the 12-nation
European Community, London-based Amnesty International and the
Netherlands government.
   If the executions are carried out, said Amnesty International,
they would bring to 32 the number to go before the firing squad
since 1985, compared to four in the previous 10 years.
   Four former palace guards were executed in mid-February for
their part in the aborted coup against the late President Sukarno
that began Sept. 30, 1965 and was crushed 48 hours later. The coup
was put down within 48 hours by troops led by then-Maj. Gen.
Suharto.
   In the bloodbath that followed, 450,000 to 500,000 people were
slain in the name of anti-communism, officials have said.
   More than half a million more were detained, among them some of
the country's best known writers, poets, educators, journalists,
film directors and intellectuals.
   Premier Ruud Lubbers on Friday offered political asylum in the
Netherlands for the six. The Netherlands froze a $12.5 million aid
package to its former colony after the February executions, but a
$90 million assistance program is continuing.
   ``This is a matter for the attorney general,'' Justice Minister
Ismail Saleh told reporters today at the installation of a new Air
Force chief of staff. At the same ceremony, Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas and State Secretary Murdiono avoided questions by reporters.
   Those facing execution are Rusland Widjayasastra, 70, Sukatno,
60, Iskandar Subekti, 67, Asep Suryaman, 62, I. Bungkus, 61, and
Marsudi, 53 _ all convicted of aiding the coup attempt.
   The coup attempt was by far the most momentous event in the
history of Indonesia, with 147 million people the world's
fifth-most most populous nation. Six army generals were killed
during the uprising, which was blamed on the Indonesian Communist
Party.
   When calm was restored in 1966, Sukarno relinquished executive
power to Suharto and the military, a situation that prevails 24
years later.
   Indonesia, once the Dutch East Indies, gained independence in
1949 after four years of fighting.

in the winner's circle says he has been barred from the backstretch
at Arlington International Racecourse for backing a lawsuit filed
by members of his flock.
   The Rev. Dave Krueckeberg, 46, has made it his mission for the
last two decades to minister to the grooms, hotwalkers, feed
workers and their families at Chicago-area race tracks.
   But officials at Arlington International told him last July he
was no longer allowed on the grounds, he said, and security guards
escorted him off the premises just as he was beginning a weekly
service.
   An attorney for the track said Friday that Arlington had hired a
chaplain trained in racetrack ministry. Krueckeberg is welcome as a
guest preacher, said the attorney, Richard Burke.
   But Krueckeberg's complaint to the Illinois Department of Human
Rights contends he is being discriminated against because he signed
an affidavit against the track three weeks before he was escorted
off the property.
   The affidavit supported a lawsuit by track workers who are
trying to overturn a management ban on families with children in
the apartments on Arlington's backstretch. The migrant workers say
they cannot afford to live anywhere else, but management contends
it is a dangerous area for children.
   ``I feel like a shepherd who has been separated from his
flock,'' the Lutheran minister said in a recent interview.
   ``I love the people, and I'm in a relationship with them. I'm
baptizing the children of children I baptized.''
   Burke said the track opted for hiring a chaplain from the Race
Track Chaplaincy of America, a nationwide organization based in New
Jersey. The track's attorney said such chaplains receive special
training in helping racetrack workers, and travel with the workers
from state to state.
   ``It had nothing to do with Rev. Krueckeberg. We have no quarrel
with him,'' Burke said in a telephone interview Friday. ``It's just
that we were attempting to handle the problem of the needs of the
track on a professional basis.''
   Krueckeberg's Lawyer, Alan Chen of the American Civil Liberties
Union of Illinois, said the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod
clergyman ``had been ministering to people on the backstretch at
Arlington Park for 20 years, without any problem.''
   Krueckeberg, who wears boots, a flannel shirt and a ski cap on
the job, has baptized babies in trailers and performed weddings in
the winner's circle.
   Whatever the outcome of Krueckeberg's complaint, which the two
sides are negotiating to try to settle, or the workers' lawsuit,
Krueckeberg will continue to minister at Hawthorne Race Course in
Stickney, Balmoral Park in Crete and at Sportsman's Park in
suburban Cicero.
   Charles Bidwill Jr., president of Sportsman's, said Friday that
Krueckeberg approached him 20 years ago and told him what he hoped
to accomplish at the track.
   ``All he wanted to do was preach the word of God to these people
and help wherever he could,'' said Bidwill. ``He's helped a lot of
people, and he's done a lot of good.''

<HEAD>10 Die When Giant Statue of Buddha Slides Off Barge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   At least 10 people drowned today when a
mammoth stone statue of Lord Buddha slid off a barge in a lake at
the central Indian city of Hyderabad, United News of India said.
   About 50 people were aboard the barge at the time of the
accident, which the news agency said. Many of them managed to swim
to shore, about 300 feet away, it added.
   United News quoted witnesses and a survivor as saying the giant
statue slid off its trailer and the barge broke up.
   The news agency quoted Hyderabad Police Commissioner Prabhakar
Rao as saying some bodies may have been trapped under the 350-ton
red granite statue, which sank in 80 feet of water in Hussain Sagar
Lake.
   Navy divers were dispatched to Hyderabad, 745 miles southeast of
New Delhi, to assist in search and salvage operations.
   The barge was being towed to a rock in the center of the lake,
where the statue was to be installed. Those aboard were
construction company workers in charge of moving the statue.
   About 130 sculptors worked on the statue, which cost $3.5
million to make, United News said. It was to have been unveiled at
a ceremony May 9 as part of a beautification project at the lake.
   Hyderabad, the capital of Andhra Pradesh state, was a major
Buddhist center in the time of King Ashoka in the 3rd century B.C.
before the Hindu and Moslem conquests.

<HEAD>Vermont Supreme Court Upholds Drug Conviction Of Ferraro's Son</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court upheld the drug
conviction of John Zaccaro Jr., son of 1984 vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro.
   Zaccaro's attorney, Kathleen Sullivan, said the court's decision
Friday showed it didn't realize the importance of protecting the
home from undercover searches.
   Zaccaro, then a student at Middlebury College, was arrested Feb.
20, 1986, at his Middlebury home after selling $25 worth of cocaine
to an undercover state police officer.
   Police searched Zaccaro's home and car before making the arrest.
   In a unanimous decision, the court rejected defense arguments
that the undercover operation was illegal or that Zaccaro was the
victim of selective prosecution because of his mother's fame.
   Zaccaro, convicted in 1988, was sentenced to one to five years
in prison, but was permitted to serve three months under house
arrest.
   The program he was sentenced under came under fire when it was
learned that he served his time in a $1,500-a-month Burlington
apartment with maid service.
   Zaccaro also completed more than 500 hours of community service
by working at the King Street Youth Center, in a program for
troubled youths.

   A man convicted in a murder that was cited by the
group claiming responsibility for two deadly mail bombs was
sentenced to die in the electric chair.
   Emmanuel Hammond, 24, was sentenced Friday by the jury that had
convicted him Wednesday of the kidnapping, murder and armed robbery
of Julie Love, a 27-year-old Atlanta preschool fitness teacher.
   A racist letter from a group claiming responsibility for the
pre-Christmas mail bomb deaths of Judge Robert Vance of the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and Savannah lawyer Robert Robinson
said the attacks were motivated by outrage over Miss Love's killing.
   Hammond is black. Love was white.
   Miss Love's father, Jerry Love; her stepmother; and her fiance
were in the courtroom when the sentence was announced.
   ``I'm very grateful to the jury, the prosecutor and the judge
for what they did, and I feel that justice was done,'' Love said.
``It's a victory of sorts, but a very shallow victory.''
   The victim's fiance, Mark Kaplan, said, ``An impartial jury,
black, white, male and female, made a decision that sent out a
strong signal _ that society is not going to put up with this type
of savage behavior.''
   The judge ordered the execution to take place next month, but
the conviction and sentence automatically will be appealed.
   Miss Love disappeared in July 1988. Her body was found in a
wooded dumping ground 13 months later. She had been shot in the
head.
   Hammond's co-defendant and cousin, W. Maurice Porter, has
pleaded guilty to murder, armed robbery and rape in the killing. He
has not been sentenced.

<HEAD>Tax Protesters Attack Police For Fifth Night</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tax protesters burned an effigy of Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and pelted police with bricks and paint bombs in
a fifth straight night of violence against new higher tax bills.
   Ten officers were injured and 37 people arrested in the violent
confrontations that ended early today in Brixton in the south
London borough of Lambeth, Scotland Yard said.
   The clashes were the latest in a popular revolt against the new
community charge, dubbed the poll tax by opponents, which takes
effect in England and Wales on April 1. Unlike income tax, or the
property tax it replaces, it must be paid by everyone over the age
of 18 regardless of their income or earnings.
   In recent opinion polls, Mrs. Thatcher's party has plunged to
its lowest level in a decade of rule, and the tax is considered a
leading factor.
   The Chartered Institute of Public Finance Accountants says the
average household paying about $830 under the current local
property tax system will pay about $1,110 under the new tax.
   Friday night's confrontation started as a carnival-type protest
outside Lambeth town hall, where Lambeth Council was meeting to
discuss an individual community charge of $900, which would be one
of the highest in Britain. It ended without a rate being set.
   During the meeting, the crowd swelled to about 2,000 and an
effigy of Mrs. Thatcher was burned, but police described the mood
as good-natured.
   Later, however, groups of protesters broke away and moved into
nearby Brixton, throwing eggs, cans, bottles and paint-filled
balloons at police, stoning a police van, and overturning a police
car, trapping an officer inside. Scotland Yard said he suffered a
concussion and broken jaw.
   A group of about 200 demonstrators continued throwing objects at
police armed with riot shields as well as at passing civilian cars,
Scotland Yard said. Police also came under attack from youths
throwing objects from a pedestrian overpass in a public housing
project.
   The violence ended shortly after midnight, Scotland Yard said.
   Anger at the new tax has sparked protests across the country,
many turning violent.
   Mrs. Thatcher on Friday blamed leftist militants for the
protests. ``Any conduct intimidating or violent is absolutely
contradictory to democracy,'' she said.
   Labor leader Neil Kinnock denounced 28 Labor lawmakers who
advocate non-payment of the new tax as ``toytown revolutionaries''
who were playing into the government's hands.
   He told the Scottish Labor Party's conference that a Labor
government would abolish the poll tax, which he dubbed ``Maggie's
tax,'' and replace it with a tax based on property and the ability
to pay. But he urged that opposition supporters pay it and stay
within the law.
   The community charge varies widely from area to area. London's
Conservative-controlled Wandsworth Council set a charge of $240 per
adult for the year. London's Labor-controlled Haringay Council on
Friday set a charge of $975 per adult.

   A teen-ager was doused with gasoline as he
slept and set ablaze by two friends apparently playing ``chicken.''
   Shaun Woods, 15, suffered first- and second-degree burns over
his chest and neck and was listed in critical condition Friday
night at the Erie County Medical Center's burn unit, hospital
officials said.
   The teen-ager's mother, Margaret Woods, said Shaun will need
extensive skin grafting.
   Woods said two boys _ one age 13 and the other age 17 _ poured
gasoline on Shaun as he slept Thursday night and then tossed a
match in his direction.
   ``My son and two other boys he has been associated with have
been playing this stupid game lately,'' Mrs. Wood said. ``It's like
a game of chicken. If they fall asleep, they throw a lighted match
at each other.''
   Shaun was at one of the boys' home when the incident occurred.
There were no adults in the home at the time, Mrs. Woods said.
   No arrests have been made and police were not releasing the
boys' names. Mrs. Wood said she would press charges.
   The incident was the second of its kind reported this week.
   David Opont, 12, was set on fire on Wednesday by a 13-year-old
in his New York City neighborhood. The boy underwent a four-hour
operation Friday to graft a thin layer of skin from his lower legs
onto his badly burned arms. Hospital officials said he faces
numerous other operations.

<HEAD>Christian Forces Skirmish Despite Aoun's Conciliatory Move</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Christian forces skirmished with
machine guns in east Beirut overnight, despite Gen. Michel Aoun's
declared readiness to negotiate peace. Police today said four
people were wounded.
   The command of Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia blamed the
violations of the week-old cease-fire on Aoun's troops and demanded
``strict measures to prevent such attempts that jeopardize
security.''
   Aoun's command said the militia fired four mortar rounds into
territories held by the general's 19,000 troops in east Beirut.
   A police spokesman, who requested anonymity in line with
regulations, said the four casualties were wounded in
militia-controlled districts.
   By police count, 750 people have been killed and 2,093 wounded
since Jan. 30, when the inconclusive showdown began for mastery of
the 310-square-mile enclave.
   The overnight exchanges, the fiercest since a mediation
committee called a cease-fire March 3, came after Aoun, in an
unexpected conciliatory move, called for dialogue with Geagea as
well as with the various other Moslem and leftist leaders to end
the nation's 15-year-old civil war.
   Aoun on Friday also dropped his outright rejection of an Arab
league-brokered peace plan worked out by Lebanese legislators in
the Saudi Arabian resort of Taif last fall.
   However, the 54-year-old general proposed that the plan be
amended, calling for a ``Taif accord No. 2.''
   Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, rejected Aoun's
proposal to amend the peace accord, declaring: ``we adhere to the
Taif agreement both in letter and spirit.''
   Voice of the People Radio, which is close to Hoss' government,
said Aoun was ``maneuvering and stalling for time.''
   The Taif accord called for a redistribution of political power
in Lebanon, doing away with Christian domination and dividing power
equally between Moslems and Christians.
   Aoun earlier had rejected the pact because it did not provide
for the immediate withdrawal of Syria's 40,000 troops, in Lebanon
under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate.
   Aoun also has ignored orders by President Elias Hrawi to step
down as army commander and turn over the Presidential Palace.
   The intra-Christian showdown has forced one-fourth of the
enclave's 1 million population to evacuate and seek refuge in safer
areas.
   The police spokesman said the estimated 250,000 evacuees who had
fled the Christian enclave due to the clashes ``do not seem to
trust the cease-fire.''
   ``Some of the evacuees return to the enclave early in the day to
check on their damaged property, but leave before dark,'' the
spokesman said.
   A mediation committee is meeting separately with Aoun and Geagea
in an effort to consolidate the cease-fire and form a ``national
authority'' grouping representatives of the warring factions and
independent figures to work out a political settlement to the
intra-Christian conflict.

<TEXT>
   At least 10 bombs exploded near the U.S.
Consulate, the state-run communications company, the home of an
army colonel and other buildings in the capital, police said today.
One person was wounded.
   There was no claim of responsibility in the attacks Friday
night, and police did not say whether they believed the attacks
were connected to Sunday's inauguration of a civilian president
after 16 years of Gen. Augusto Pinochet's military rule. Pinochet
will turn over government to President-elect Patricio Aylwin.
   The blasts, within 45 minutes of each other, damaged some of the
buildings, police said.
   The wounded man, a night maintenance worker, was hurt in a blast
in a park near downtown about 200 feet away from the U.S. Consulate.
   Bombs also went off at a courthouse in Santiago, at a building
belonging to the state National Communications Co., another one at
a Mormon church in a working-class neighborhood in the south.
   Others exploded off near the house of an army colonel who was
not identified, at a public school, at a government tourist office,
at a suburban city hall, and in front of two private businesses.
   In an emotional farewell, Pinochet on Friday pinned ``Mission
Accomplished'' medals on his Cabinet ministers and said his 16
-year-old military government restored order.
   The general said he called the final Cabinet meeting Friday to
``reaffirm the absolute peace of mind that we should feel for
having fully accomplished our mission.''
   Pinochet, however, has said he remain commander of the military
despite Aylwin's call for him to hand over control.
   In a low voice charged with emotion, Pinochet said his
right-wing military government was leaving behind ``a society that
is free, at peace and orderly.''
   Pinochet presented each minister with a ``Mission Accomplished''
medal. The award was recently minted by the government and Pinochet
received the first medal.
   International human rights organizations have repeatedly
criticized the government for grave human rights abuses since
Pinochet led the Sept. 11, 1973, coup that toppled elected
President Salvador Allende.
   Also Friday, in a separate ceremony to decorate the new
commander of the navy, Pinochet said the armed forces will remain
strong and united after he gives up power.
   ``We can never be defeated, no matter how treacherous the
actions of those who try to destroy us,'' he said.
   He did not elaborate, but in other recent speeches Pinochet and
other military leaders have warned of alleged efforts by
anti-Pinochet political groups to infiltrate and destroy the armed
forces.
   Under a 1980 constitution written by his administration,
Pinochet, 74, cannot be replaced for eight years as commander of
the powerful 60,000-member army.
   The Constitution also makes the armed forces the ``guarantor''
of Chile's internal security and legal framework.
   Since the Dec. 14 national elections, Pinochet has pushed
through legislation that limits the president's power to promote or
retire military officers and restricts the civil leadership's role
in making military appointments.
   Aylwin, a 71-year-old lawyer and veteran politician, is backed
by a coalition of leftist and centrist parties that battled for an
end to Pinochet's long reign. In the elections he won 55 percent of
the vote, compared with 29 percent for a pro-Pinochet candidate.
   On Friday, preparations for Aylwin's weekend inauguration were
in full swing. In the Pacific port city of Valparaiso, workers were
busily outfitting the new congressional palace, still under
construction, where the ceremony is to take place.
   Vice President Dan Quayle will represent the United States at
the inauguration and will stay at the U.S. ambassador's residence.
   In Santiago, the presidential palace was nearly empty, as
members of Pinochet's administration vacated their offices and
military officials moved back to army facilities.

   The motorman who operated a subway train
that derailed and killed three people tested postive for cocaine,
and mechanics inspected cars to make sure their motors are
installed correctly.
   John K. Lauber of the National Transportation Safety Board on
Friday said urine tests uncovered traces of cocaine in the
motorman's system. Louis Gambaccini, general manager of the
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, said the
motorman would be suspended as of Monday.
   No other details about the employee, including his name, were
released.
   Lauber said inspectors examined 76 motors on 19 cars Friday.
They found 27 cotter pins, which help hold the motors in place
underneath the cars, installed improperly.
   Lauber said the cotter pins are designed to slip through a nut
and the bolt the nut is screwed onto. The improperly fitted cotter
pins were turned down too far on the bolts, failing to lock the
nuts.
   ``That is not the proper way of securing that mechanism,'' he
said.
   The NTSB recommended that the transit authority immediately
inspect the motors on all 240 subway cars. Gambaccini said the
recommendation would be carried out.
   Investigators believe a motor on a car came loose Wednesday, hit
a switch and sent half of a six-car train onto another set of
tracks. The fourth car smashed into steel support beams, killing
three passengers and trapping survivors.
   Of 94 injured, 10 remained hospitalized Friday, all in good or
satisfactory condition, hospital officials said.
   Within three hours of the accident, the train conductor and
motorman underwent tests for alcohol and drugs, Lauber said. Both
tested negative for alcohol use. A urine test on the conductor for
other drugs also was negative.
   Investigators have not determined whether cocaine played a role
in the accident, he said.
   ``We have no idea when the cocaine was ingested, at what time
and whether or not it had an effect or was a factor in this
accident,'' Lauber said. That question, he said, would receive
``further analysis.''
   Lauber declined to comment on whether the worker had been
disciplined for or had tested positive for drug use in the past,
saying the investigation was continuing.
   Gambaccini said the transportation authority has initiated a
comprehensive drug-testing program.
   ``It is our understanding that SEPTA is only one of two of the
larger urban transit authorities that conducts random drug
testing,'' he said.
   He also insisted Philadelphia's rail system was safe.
   ``Transportation in all modes has accidents,'' he said. ``I
believe that it is safe. This is the single, most tragic accident
in the history of'' the system.
   The accident was the worst since the Market-Frankford Line began
operation 21 years ago. A 37-block stretch of that line remained
closed Friday. Service was expected to resume Monday.

   An Iranian newspaper today said a ``media
blitz'' on U.S. hostages in Lebanon was designed in part to prepare
the American public for a military mission to try to free the
captives.
   In Beirut, a key Shiite Moslem leader, Mohammed Hussein
Fadlallah, said of the hostages: ``We believe there are encouraging
elements regarding readiness to deal with this issue.''
   Fadlallah, spiritual leader of the pro-Iran Hezbollah, or Party
of God, was answering a question from the newspaper al-Liwa if he
thought the hostages would be released in 1990.
   On Feb. 23, after returning from a trip to Iran, Fadlallah had
called for ``realistic and humanitarian means to free the
hostages.'' Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for groups
holding some of the 18 Western hostages.
   The newspaper Kayhan International, in an editorial, said a U.S.
military rescue mission, involving Israel, would ``end the
so-called crisis with the death of at least the American hostages.''
   The newspaper cited no source or facts to back its assertions.
   Eight American hostages are among the 18 Westerners being held
by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, who was abducted March 16, 1985.
   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, called the Iranian newspaper
report ``rather bizarre.''
   ``There's so much flying around out there, that one doesn't know
what to put stock in,'' said Mrs. Say, who recently completed a
trip to Europe and the Middle East to discuss the hostage issue
with political leaders.
   But she added: ``I think the `media blitz' remark is well
founded because the media have built themselves into a frenzy that
something will happen by March 16, and neither I nor anybody else
can do anything to dissuade them.''
   Kayhan International, which is often at variance with Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani, said: ``If the U.S. and Israel embark
on military adventurism, the hostages will in fact be a pretext for
crippling the Islamic movement.''
   Rafsanjani said earlier this week that the hostage issue was
nearing solution, and recent editorials in the Tehran Times have
also said the hostages were near release.
   The Iranian president, attempting to consolidate his hold on
power, is opposed by radicals who disagree with his wish to end
Iran's isolation and gain Western participation in rebuilding the
country after an eight-year war with Iraq.
   Kayhan's editorial today said said other reasons for the current
media campaign in the U.S. press is to evaluate the reaction of
Iranian officials and to use the humanitarian aspect to put
pressure on Iran.
   It said another reason for the U.S. ``hostage propaganda'' was
aimed at positioning American firms to take part in rebuilding Iran.
   ``That is why (America) is looking red-eyed and sullen at the
lively competition being waged by Italians, Germans, Russians and
Japanese,'' Kayhan said.
   The editorial was reported by Iran's official Islamic Republic
News Agency, monitored in Nicosia.
   It said recent stories on the hostages were ``a media blitz
designed to create activity and certain conditions that at present
are non-existant,'' Kayhan said without elaborating.
   Kayhan mentioned the February incident in which Bush was
persuaded to talk to someone he thought was Rafsanjani but was not.
The incident was first reported Thursday.
   It called the Bush attempt at diplomacy ``callow.''
   In a Friday sermon, Rafsanjani said the phone hoax showed the
``confusion of leaders inside the White House.'' He said that
although the United States needs to talk to Iran, Iran is not ready
to talk to the United States.
   Iran denies any connection with the kidnappings but has said it
would use its influence for their release if the United States
fulfilled certain conditions such as freeing frozen Iranian assets.

``strong action'' if the hostages were not released, state Gov.
Jagmohan said.
   The governor said the five men, abducted at gunpoint from their
jeep on Friday night, were released early today after government
loudspeakers blared all-night warnings. Jagmohan said they had not
been harmed.
   The kidnappings were the latest example of unrest that has
occurred since a Jan. 20 crackdown on the separatist movement. At
173 people have died, mostly Moslem separatists killed in clashes
with federal security troops.
   ``Our approach of firmness in dealing with the terrorists
worked,'' Jagmohan said of the releases. He said the five men,
members of the Jammu-Kashmir state police intelligence branch,
reappeared without warning in the same area where they were
abducted.
   No reponsibility claims or demands were made on behalf of the
abductors.
   The five officers had been in a jeep patrolling a congested
residential area in the heart of Srinagar, core of the movement
demanding mostly Moslem Kashmir's independence from predominantly
Hindu India.
   A curfew designed to confine people indoors was in effect at the
time of the abduction, but suddenly the intelligence officers' jeep
was surrounded by a crowd, Jagmohan said. He said three young men
took the officers from the jeep at gunpoint and set fire to the
vehicle.
   ``Had we succumbed to their pressure, we would have surrendered
to the terrorists, but this time we did not,'' said Jagmohan, who
uses only one name.
   He was referring to December's abduction of the daughter of the
federal home minister. The young woman, a Srinagar medical student
who was taken from a van by armed men, was freed unharmed when the
government bowed to the kidnappers' demands and released five
detained members of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front. Jagmohan, a
Hindu with a reputation as a tough administrator, was appointed
governor of Jammu-Kashmir state on Jan. 18.
   The curfew in Srinagar was lifted between 5 a.m. and 10 a.m.
today for the first time in 48 hours.
   An around-the-clock curfew had been in effect from midday
Thursday and throughout Friday while a high-powered delegation from
New Delhi, including ex-Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, visited
Srinagar to assess the situation.
   On Friday, the government said it had opened indirect talks with
the militants in an effort to resolve escalating violence and
demands for independence.

   The Soviet Union will cut back on underground
nuclear testing and move the site for the explosions from Asia to
an island inside the Arctic Circle, says a report published today.
   The move to the Arctic location will force the Soviets to
conduct fewer tests and will hamper development of weapons that
could be used against the United States, The Washington Post
reported in today's editions.
   The decision came after strong political pressure inside the
Soviet Union, The Post said, citing unidentified Soviet and U.S.
sources.
   Col. Gen. Vladmir Gerasimov was reported as telling committees
of the Supreme Soviet, the national legislature, that the defense
ministry plans to conduct 27 more tests at the Semipalatinsk site
in south-central Asia before closing it in 1993. That rate is
roughly 40 percent below the current pace of testing.
   U.S. officials were quoted as saying the Soviet announcement
came as no surprise and added that it still may not curb pressure
within that country for a complete moratorium on underground
nuclear explosions.
   The Soviet test site will be moved to Novaya Zemlya, a large
island in the Barents Sea within the Arctic Circle, the newspaper
said. The inhospitable surroundings will make work difficult and
will further slow testing, U.S. officials told the newspaper.

<HEAD>10 Dead in New Unrest, Widespread Arrests Reported</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

   Police said today that at
least 10 people were killed in factional clashes, and authorities
reportedly arrested more than 70 suspects in nationwide raids to
curb growing violent unrest.
   Meanwhile, police firing shotguns, tear gas and rubber bullets
clashed with protesters in several parts of the country, but no
serious injuries were reported, a police report said.
   The black-on-black factional fighting came amid the worst
violence in South Africa since the mid-1980s. More than 200 people
have died in the past month.
   The state-run South African Broadcasting Corporation reported
today that more than 70 people were detained nationwide to try to
halt the violence. The report gave no other details.
   In the factional fighting overnight, nine protesters died and
one police officer was killed by gunmen, the police report said.
   The worst violence in recent days was in the black township of
Kathlehong outside Johannesburg, where police reported finding
three more bodies today, bringing the death toll in the devastated
township during the past week to at least 22, with scores injured.
   A fight between rival taxi companies in the township exploded
into a major factional fight, and hundreds of residents have fled
the area. The South African Police sent extra units into the area
to protect residents and halt the fighting, police said.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok told Parliament on Friday
that the government was determined to end unrest and was prepared
to use its extensive powers under the 3{-year-old state of
emergency to quell the violence.
   The pro-apartheid Conservative Party blamed the government for
the violence. Opposition leaders said President F.W. de Klerk's
decision to legalize the African National Congress and other
opposition groups encouraged radicals to attempt to seize power.
   De Klerk legalized the ANC last month to try and clear the way
for talks on ending white minority rule and sharing political power
with the black majority.
   The government has charged that some anti-apartheid groups are
behind the outbreak of violence in South Africa and some tribal
homelands because they are not ready to participate in negotiations
with the white government.
   But ANC leader Walter Sisulu said Friday that the government was
reverting ``to the old approach of looking for scapegoats and
hidden `instigators.'''
   ``The primary reason for the unrest, conflict and confrontation
has always been the poverty and violence caused by apartheid,'' he
said.

   Israeli police shot and killed two Palestinians
at stone-throwing protests in a refugee camp in Arab east
Jerusalem, Arab reports said, prompting other skirmishes and a
strike today.
   The shootings Friday night and early today and were among the
worst in Jerusalem during the 27-month-old Palestinian uprising
against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Police confirmed one dead and two wounded, saying in a statement
that the incidents are being investigated. Arab and U.N. reports
said two people were killed.
   The trouble occurred after Israeli leaders repeated their claim
to the Arab sector of Jerusalem despite recent U.S. statements that
the status of the land was in dispute and should be resolved by
negotiation.
   Israel radio linked the violence to the U.S.-Israeli dispute
over the status of Jerusalem. It said camp residents ``were
encouraged by U.S. statements.''
   Jerusalem mayor Teddy Kollek also linked the violence to the
dispute, and noted ``the impatience of radical elements in east
Jerusalem with the slowness and uncertainty of the Israeli
government in advancing the peace process.''
   Israel captured the Gaza Strip from Egypt and the West Bank and
east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war. It has
since annexed east Jerusalem, home to 140,000 Palestinians, and has
been building Jewish neighborhoods around the Arab enclave to
strengthen its hold on the land.
   Both President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III
have said in the past 10 days that Israel's policy of settling Jews
in the occupied lands is an impediment to peace.
   The incidents apparently began Friday night when Palestinians in
the Shufat refugee camp, the only camp within Jerusalem's city
limits, tried to barricade entrances and threw stones at police,
Arab reports said.
   The reports said stones also were thrown at passing Israeli cars
on a nearby highway, damaging 14 vehicles. Police said only that
``there was damage to a number of vehicles.''
   Arab reports said police opened fire in Shufat on Friday night
and again today to quell stone-throwing protesters.
   Residents of the camp identified the victims as Mahmud Fawzi Abu
Khalife, 21, who was shot in the stomach, and Sufian Mohammed
Abdullah Khalil, 25, who was hit with a bullet in the head.
   Officials with the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which oversees
aid programs for the refugees, confirmed both deaths and said at
least two other Palestinians were wounded, one critically.
   As word of the deaths spread, scattered stone-throwing clashes
broke out this morning in east Jerusalem and merchants shuttered
their stores in protest at the deaths. Barricades were put up by
camp residents again this morning, the Arab reports said.
   Students were seen blocking city streets with boulders and
overturned trash cans and hurling stones at police. Passing cars
and police squads also were stoned, and several windows were
reported broken, merchants said.
   Tear gas was used to disperse demonstrators outside at least two
east Jerusalem schools.
   After the shooting today, paramilitary border police ordered
residents to remain in their homes and rounded up hundreds of young
Palestinians in a schoolyard for questioning.
   Reporters were blocked from entering the camp and could see some
of the police activity from the camp entrances.
   The deaths raised to 661 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israelis in the uprising, which began in December 1987. A total of
194 other Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs, most on
suspicion of collaborating with Israeli authorities. Forty-three
Israelis also have been killed.
   The toll in Jerusalem rose to at least 10 dead, including six
Palestinians and four Israelis.

<HEAD>Agreement on Total Withdrawal of Troops Signed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union and Hungary today
signed an agreement calling for all Red Army troops to be withdrawn
from Hungarian territory by the middle of next year, Hungarian
radio reported.
   The pullout will begin Monday, according to the agreement signed
in Moscow by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and his
Hungarian counterpart, Gyula Horn, the report said.
   Hungary is the second Warsaw Pact country to negotiate a
complete withdrawal of Soviet troops.
   Prague and Moscow reached an agreement last month on the removal
of 73,500 Soviet troops from Czechoslovakia. The pullout there
began Feb. 26.
   Such pullouts were requested after pro-democracy revolutions
swept Communists from power across Eastern Europe late last year
and early this year.
   The signing of the Hungarian-Soviet agreement came just one day
after negotiations were completed on its terms and a timetable for
the withdrawal.
   There had been initial disagreement over the date for the
pullout to be completed, but the two sides finally agreed that all
troops and equipment should be withdrawn by June 30, 1991. That's
the same date that the withdrawal from Czechoslovakia is to be
finished.
   The Soviets reportedly had wanted the Hungarian withdrawal to be
completed on Aug. 31, 1991, to give them more time for dismantling
military stockpiles but agreed to the earlier date sought by the
Hungarians.
   There are 49,700 Soviet soldiers in Hungary as well as 27,146
combat vehicles, including 860 tanks and 1,500 armored personnel
carriers, accoriding to Hungarian military officials.
   According to the Hungarian radio report, two-thirds of the
withdrawal of Soviet forces and equipment is to be completed by the
end of this year.
   Horn traveled to Moscow today. The agreement was initialed
Friday by the heads of the two delegations negotiating the terms of
the withdrawal.
   Attending the final round of talks that ended in Moscow on
Friday were three Hungarian observers representing opposition
parties competing in national elections March 25. They are to be
the first free, multiparty elections since the Communists
consolidated power in 1948.

   Georgia has become the fourth Soviet republic to
condemn its annexation to the Soviet Union, calling the move ``an
international crime'' and demanding talks to secure independence, a
local news agency reported.
   In Lithuania, meanwhile, activists preparing for an expected
declaration of independence said the powerful Sajudis movement
wants to replace the republic's Communist president, who could
stand in the way of immediate secession.
   Lithuania would be the first of the Soviet Union's 15 republics
to declare independence and would confront President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev with one of the worst crises in five years of governing.
The Soviet Parliament is to vote Monday on his proposal to increase
presidential power over unruly republics.
   All three Baltic republics _ Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania _
have condemned the Soviet annexation of their lands a half century
ago and have strong pro-independence movements.
   Sajudis, the pro-independence popular movement that dominates
Lithuanian politics, will probably back one of its three leading
figures for president of the republic, activists said as tonight's
legislative session neared.
   Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas backs independence and
his Communist Party broke away from the national party in December.
But Sajudis activist Haroldas Subachius said the group decided it
would be unfitting for him to be reelected because the Communists
lost their majority in elections last month.
   Many Sajudis members also fear Brazauskas is ``not firm enough''
in his support for independence, Subachius said.
   As chairman of the republic's 141-seat Supreme Soviet,
Brazauskas conceivably could stave off immediate confrontation with
the Kremlin by delaying debate on the secession issue, which is
expected to begin Sunday.
   The resolution by the Georgian Supreme Soviet legislature,
quoted by the Independent News Agency of Georgia, ``denounces the
occupation and annexation of Georgia by Soviet Russia and considers
it to be an international crime.''
   It calls the entrance of troops ``a military interference,
intervention and occupation with the aim of overthrowing the
existing political order'' and says: ``It is necessary to start
talks on restoration of an independent state of Georgia.''
   The official news agency Tass, in a four-sentence report on the
resolution, said nothing about the sections condemning the Red
Army's occupation of Georgia in Feb. 1921 and the subsequent
treaties that made Georgia part of the Soviet Union.
   The mountainous Caucasus republic, the birthplace of former
Soviet ruler Josef Stalin, has 5 million residents. It first became
a part of the Russian empire in the early 1800s. It was briefly
independent again after the Bolshevik revolution.
   It has long had an active independence movement. In April,
Soviet troops armed with gas and sharpened shovels killed 19
pro-independence demonstrators while chasing them off the main
street of Georgia's capital Tbilisi.
   The Georgian resolution calls ``inadmissible'' Gorbachev's
proposal for the president to declare a state of emergency and
martial law.
   The declaration says that would ``introduce an authoritarian
presidential rule, which may be interpreted as the president's
right to remove organs of power in a union republic and thus to
completely eliminate the republic's sovereignty.''
   The resolution says the republic's deputies' participation in
approving the draft law also would be ``inadmissible.''
   Gorbachev hopes to win approval of the constitutional amendment
in Monday's special session of the Congress of People's Deputies,
despite progressives' complaints that the draft would give him
``dictatorial'' powers.
   The resolution says presidential measures taken to protect the
nation's territorial unity ``should not conflict with the
realization of a republic's right to secede from the USSR.''
   Lithuania moved up its vote on declaring independence to Sunday
precisely because activists fear Gorbachev will use his new powers
to forcibly prevent them from splitting from the Soviet Union.
   Lithuania's newly elected lawmakers on Friday pressed on toward
a showdown with Moscow, discussing how to take the reins of power
after a declaration of independence.
   ``Moscow is menacing us. We hope it's only with words,'' said
Anderus Kubilus, secretary of Sajudis, Lithuania's pro-independence
movement. ``We don't think there will be an acute economic
blockade. It wouldn't be profitable for them, either economically
or in terms of international opinion. But we don't know.''
   In comments reported Wednesday by official Radio Vilnius,
Gorbachev appeared to accept Lithuania's right to secede, but
cautioned that the once-independent state would have to pay $34
billion in compensation for factories built and money invested
during a half-century of Soviet rule.
   The republic's parliament will be asked to reaffirm an act first
passed on Feb. 16, 1918 declaring the state independent. Lawmakers
already have declared illegal Lithuania's incorporation into the
Soviet Union in 1940 under a secret Nazi-Soviet pact.
   Lawmakers also will be asked to restore the 1938 constitution
that was swept away by Josef Stalin's Kremlin in favor of a
Soviet-style law.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A Western ambassador and a
high-ranking army source said today that Haiti's ruler, Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril, will step down in the face of violent
anti-government demonstrations.
   Avril was to resign today and hand over power to the army chief
who will preside over a transition to civilian rule, the sources
said on condition of anonymity. The Western ambassador said Avril
will relinquish power to Maj. Gen. Herard Abraham, the army's
commander-in-chief.
   Abraham, in turn, will have 72 hours to hand over the government
to a civilian council headed by a Supreme Court justice, the
ambassador said.
   The Army High Command source said Avril would remain in Haiti
after stepping down and a 48-hour curfew would be imposed to
prevent disorder.
   The prediction came after five days of anti-government
demonstrations and calls by an opposition coalition that Avril
relinquish power.
   The army source said the main problem facing the High Command
was how to handle possible resistance among the 1,000-member
Presidential Guard, many of whom are hostile to the idea of
democratic government.
   A palace source said, however, that the guards would not resist
the transfer of power. The source also spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   If Avril steps down, it will be the fifth change in leadership
in Haiti since 1986, when President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled the
impoverished country during widespread protests, ending a 29-year
family dictatorship.
   The idea of setting up a civilian council headed by the Supreme
Court's vice president, Gabriel Volcy, was proposed last week by
the Unity Assembly, an umbrella group of 11 opposition political
parties and a civic organization. The council is to prepare for
legitimate elections.
   On Friday night, the Unity Assembly issued a statement calling
for an ``unlimited total paralysis of the country'' if Avril didn't
resign by Monday.
   Also Friday, troops fired on 250 student demonstrators in
Port-au-Prince, and three protesters were reported wounded.
   State television said Avril met with his Army High Command and
with church leaders about ``bringing peace'' to Haiti.
   A U.S. Embassy diplomat said the United States was not involved
in negotiations with Avril but added without elaboration that the
talks were expected to be successful.
   ``We are keeping in touch with them but we are in no way
involved with negotiations. We are not putting together a deal. It
is up to Haitians to decide if there's to be a change in
government,'' the diplomat said on condition of anonymity.
   Avril, who came to power in a soldiers' revolt in September
1988, promised political reform and elections after taking power,
but he exiled seven opposition activists and arrested scores of
people in a crackdown in January. Avril scheduled general elections
this year, but most parties refuse to participate, saying they
don't trust him to give up power.
   The latest round of mass protests in Haiti began Monday after
troops killed an 11-year-old girl studying on her porch.
   On Friday, witnesses and radio reports said soldiers opened fire
on about 250 students protesting at the state university, wounding
three. Three people were killed Thursday, including a soldier beat
to death by an angry mob.
   Demonstrations also broke out Friday in the outskirts of
Port-au-Prince and continued until sundown with protesters putting
up flaming tire barricades and soldiers shooting in the air to
break up crowds.
   In the heart of Port-au-Prince, groups of heavily armed soldiers
guarded the National Palace and two manned anti-aircraft guns were
positioned on the palace's front lawn.
   The capital of 1 million, usually teeming with people on weekend
nights, was deserted Friday night and early today.
   The remnants of smoldering tire barricades remained in many
intersections and there was sporadic gunfire heard around the
palace.

<TEXT>
   A journalist for a British newspaper has been
sentenced to death in Iraq for alleged espionage, and a British
nurse has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for allegedly
helping him, the Foreign Office said today.
   Farzad Bazoft, a 31-year-old stateless Iranian exile who travels
with British documents and works for London's weekly Observer
newspaper, was arrested in September while investigating reports of
an explosion at an Iraqi military plant. Nurse Daphne Parish, 52,
was accused of helping him by driving him to the plant.
   An Iraqi who was in contact with Bazoft in Baghdad was also
given a 10-year sentence for communicating government secrets to a
foreigner, the Foreign Office said.
   Bazoft and Mrs. Parish went on trial Thursday in a revolutionary
court, charged with committing hostile acts against Iraq. The
Iraqi, identified only as Rahim, was tried with them.
   The proceedings, which were not open to the public, adjourned
after five hours, and the Foreign Office said it received a report
by telephone this morning of the sentences.
   Under Iraqi law, no appeal is allowed.
   ``We utterly deplore these harsh and excessive sentences,'' a
Foreign Office statement said.
   Iraq's ambassador to Britain, Dr. Azmi Shafiq Al-Salihi, was
being summoned to the Foreign Office to hear the government's
``utter dismay'' and an appeal for clemency was being made to
Iraq's President Saddam Hussein, the Foreign Office said.
   ``No evidence was produced at the trial which would justify
sentences of this severity,'' the Foreign Office said. ``They come
ill from a regime which is trying to show a more liberal face to
the world.''
   In November, Bazoft appeared on Iraqi state television and said
he had been spying for Israel. Mrs. Parish, a senior nursing
administrator for the Irish-run, Ibn al-Bitar hospital in Baghdad,
did not appear in the broadcast.
   Observer editor Donald Trelford said the paper was certain that
Bazoft was not spying for anyone. He said the statement must have
been made under duress and noted that Bazoft appeared to be in poor
physical shape.
   Trelford said today that although Bazoft said at his trial that
the TV confession was made under duress, it was admitted as
evidence nonetheless.
   ``The sentences are barbaric and unjust,'' Trelford said. ``Our
first objective is to have the death sentence lifted prior to their
release and return to Britain.''
   Trelford said Bazoft had sought official permission to visit the
Al-Iskandaria military complex south of Baghdad, had told the paper
of his movements, and had talked openly about the visit to
colleagues on his return to Baghdad.
   ``None of this conduct is consistent with espionage. It is
entirely consistent with journalism,'' he said.
   Trelford said Iraq refused to allow a British lawyer to attend
the trial or The Observer to be represented.
   As Bazoft is an Iranian, the Foreign Office said it was not in
the same position to argue on his behalf as it was for Mrs. Parish,
who is British-born. But it said it was appealing on Bazoft's
behalf for humanitarian reasons and because he lived in Britain for
years.
   Britain has brought up the case with every prominent Iraqi
minister or official who has visited London in the past few months,
the Foreign Office said.
   It said it had also complained to Iraq about ``shortcomings in
the treatment'' of the two, particularly the denial of consular
access to Mrs. Parish for almost three months.
   The explosion at a military complex was reported in London to
have killed up to 700 people, but the Iraqis later said 19 people
were killed in a fuel depot blast.

   The Libyan legislature has issued a strong defense
of the plant the United States says is producing poison gas, the
official Libyan news agency reported today.
   Libya's people will ``stand as a shield to protect'' the Rabta
``pharmaceutical factory,'' the JANA news agency quoted the General
Poeple's Congress as saying.
   JANA, in a dispatch monitored in Rome, also said the congress
denounced chemical weapons, saying the Libyans are ``against all
types of weapons of mass destruction'' including ``nuclear,
bacteriological and chemical'' ones.
   The congress, made up of representatives from local grass-roots
governing committees throughout the North African nation and
roughly the equivalent of a parliament, met Friday night in
Tripoli, the Libyan capital, JANA said.
   The White House has charged that the plant at Rabta, 65 miles
southwest of Tripoli, is apparently producing poison gas. Other
U.S. officials said the plant was making some mustard gas and nerve
agents.
   Libyans made similar vows early last year following the first
round of U.S. accusations that the facility was gearing up to
produce chemical weapons.
   The congress reiterated previous Libyan statements that the
country supports international inspection, provided that controls
are universally applied, JANA said.
   Last year, Col. Moammar Gadhafi's government offered to open the
plant to inspection provided the United States also lets its

   King Moshoeshoe II of Lesotho is going
into exile in Britain after a bitter dispute with the country's
military government, palace officials said today.
   The king of the mountainous African nation left for London
today, according to palace officials who declined to be named.
   But government officials, who also spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the king was going on vacation to rest for an
indefinite period.
   The palace officials said the king decided to go into exile
after Maj. Gen. Justin Lekhanya, head of the military government,
stripped him of all constitutional powers last month and arrested
some of his friends and relatives.
   King Moshoeshoe has protested Lekhanya's steps, but has been
powerless to resist. Lekhanya and his allies on the ruling military
council control the country, which is completely surrounded by
South Africa.
   The king went into exile in 1970, spending several months in the
Netherlands, during a dispute with the authoritarian civilian
government that controlled Lesotho at the time.
   The Lesotho military took power in a 1986 coup headed by
Lekhanya, ousting the authoritarian regime of Leabua Jonathon.
   The military government and the king have been locked in a
struggle for power, with the monarch attempting to assert his
control over the country.

   Vice President Dan Quayle turned to
economic and trade talks in a meeting today with leaders of
Caribbean nations as he continued his weeklong trip to shore up
American relations in Latin America.
   Quayle arrived Friday in Barbados after discussions in Venezuela
on the prospects of moving the Nicaraguan Contra rebels from their
Honduran border camps to enclaves within Nicaragua as an interim
step in demobilization.
   Quayle also discussed Central America with Barbados Prime
Minister Lloyd Erskine Sandiford. And he was briefing the leaders
of five other Caribbean nations on his talks with Venezuelan
President Carlos Andres Perez and Spanish Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez, who also was in Venezuela.
   The meeting today, held against a backdrop of palm trees and an
ocean view at the official residence of the American charges
d'affaires, included Sandiford and the leaders from Barbados,
Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Kitts, St. Lucia and
Antigua.
   Quayle said he promised Sandiford on Friday that he would pursue
a resolution to the ``very important subject'' involving a
U.S.-Barbados taxation agreement.
   The issue centers on U.S. taxes on American insurance and
banking companies that lose incentive to locate in Barbados unless
they can escape those taxes.
   Quayle was flying later today to Santiago, Chile, where he and
his wife Marilyn will represent the United States at the
inauguration Sunday of President-elect Patricio Aylwin.
   On the first day of his week-long trip to Barbados and South
America, the vice president was pressed by Perez and Gonzalez on
the need for rapid disbandment of the U.S.-built Contra army.
   ``They were pressing very hard for very early disbandment,''
said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who is accompanying Quayle to
Chile and who sat in on the meetings Friday.
   Kennedy said he agrees the Contras should be demobilized
immediately, regardless of the Bush administration's insistence
that their security must be assured for reintegrating into
Nicaragua.
   One official traveling with Quayle indicated the administration
is leaning to the idea of interim relocation in designated areas.
United Nations peacekeeping troops would insure order under that
scenario, making sure there were no clashes between the Contras and
members of the Nicaraguan army, which is still controlled by the
outgoing leftist Sandinista government.
   ``That might be a way station to disarmament,'' the official
said when asked whether the administration envisions having the
Contras keep their weapons in such camps. The official spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The official reiterated that the administration wants the
Contras to disband before Violeta Chamorro, the U.S.-backed
candidate who defeated Sandinista President Daniel Ortega in the
Feb. 25 election, takes office April 25.
   He said the United States expects at the same time, however,
that the Sandinistas will submit to a peaceful transfer of power,
including relinquishing control of the 70,000-man army.
   But Quayle later said in Barbados, ``I'm not saying everything
will be accomplished by the 25th of April. We hope to accomplish a
lot by then. I don't believe it's important to focus on whether
it's the 25th or the 26th. I think it's important to focus on the
concept, and the goal,'' of having the new government succeed.
   Quayle's discussions in Venezuela focused almost entirely on how
to ensure a peaceful transfer of power in Nicaragua after a decade
of Marxist rule.
   Quayle said the administration will announce next week its aid
package to help get the country's desperate economy moving again.
   The package will weigh heavily on agricultural assistance,
because Nicaragua is largely agrarian, and will include trade
assistance as well, said the official traveling with Quayle.

<HEAD>Many Jews Feel Uneasy and Helpless About the New Germany</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After the speakers had finished wrestling with the
subject of their symposium _``Germany in the 1990s; Jewish Hopes
and Fears'' _ an old, white-haired man in the audience struggled to
his feet.
   ``Everybody says reunification of Germany is unavoidable, but is
everybody really happy about this forthcoming reunification?'' he
said. ``I, a refugee from Vienna in 1939, am not, and I suspect
that there must be many people here who equally are not happy.''
   His remarks encapsulated the unease and helplessness felt by
many Western European Jews _ although clearly not all _ at the
prospect of a united Germany.
   ``It is happening too soon; it is happening too fast,'' said
Claude Lanzmann, the Frenchman who made the epic Holocaust
documentary ``Shoah.''
   ``Germany is a special country,'' he said in a telephone
interview from Paris. ``One cannot guess now what this new Germany
will be, what the contradictions and the tensions will be inside
this country. The new German nationalism will have, in my opinion,
a very strong revival.
   ``Nobody can say calmly today that this new Germany will behave
like the former Federal Republic'' of West Germany, Lanzmann said.
   The London symposium's audience consisted mostly of elderly Jews
_ Holocaust survivors, refugees, people who had achieved peace and
prosperity in Britain but were still sufficiently preoccupied with
the Nazi past to crowd into a basement auditorium and air their
fears.
   Reassurances that there could never be another Hitler were
coupled with vaguely expressed fears for the future. A man spoke of
``this feeling of impotence'' in the face of a German giant risen
again.
   Like a dark backdrop to the proceedings lay the fears Jews feel
about reawakened anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union and in Eastern
and Central Europe.
   ``No matter what the structure will be, at this moment, as Jews,
as people who have often experienced Germany at its worst, we have
great fears that cannot be easily laid aside,'' said Albert
Friedlander, a London rabbi and Holocaust survivor.
   There were moments when the panel of rabbis and scholars seemed
sharply at odds with the audience.
   When a speaker, professor Geoffrey Alderman, remarked that
Germany was not wholly responsible for the two world wars, there
were angry mutterings of ``nonsense'' and ``rubbish.''
   Friedlander said he was more worried about French anti-Semitism
than about a reunited Germany. Alderman declared that some remarks
he had heard privately from orthodox Jews about Germany ``quite
frankly strike me as racist.''
   In a letter last month to Rabbi Marvin Hier of Los Angeles, who
demanded measures by a united Germany to preserve the memory of the
Holocaust, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany sounded aggrieved.
   He listed the many measures already taken and said: ``To my
mind, there is no doubt that these provisions will also apply in a
united Germany. This certainly does not require any special
demand.''
   European Jews readily acknowledge West Germany's record of
liberal democracy and support for Israel. They also are gratified
by East Germany's apparent new-found readiness to share the blame
for the Nazi era and make amends to the Jews.
   ``I don't think a democratic German state will represent any
danger for Jews or Israel,'' said Leo Eitinger, a Czechoslovak
survivor of the Holocaust who is a psychiatrist in Norway.
   Jean Bloch, a Belgian Jew who experienced the Hitler era, noted
the conditions that spawned Nazism _ economic crisis and national
humiliation _ do not exist now.
   ``We must be careful not to stir the same feeling of humiliation
by opposing unification,'' he said.
   Ronnie Naftaniel, a spokesman for Dutch Jewry, said: ``The fact
that Israel is on the map makes Jews everywhere sleep better.''
   Many Jews, when asked, admit to an instinctive anxiety. It is
shared by many non-Jews in Europe, but for Jews it is compounded by
memories of the Holocaust that stripped them down to tiny
minorities in many European countries.
   An oft-heard remark, laced with bitterness, is that if there's
no anti-Semitism in Germany it must because so few Jews are left
there _ about 41,500, compared to 560,000 before World War II.
   ``The Germans always were unpredictable,'' said Simon
Wiesenthal, the Nazi hunter. ``They become foolhardy as soon as
they feel strong. They have to be careful not to repeat mistakes.''
   Alderman told the London symposium that, to orthodox Jews, the
division of Germany was not just a product of the Cold War, but a
punishment ``visited by the Almighty upon the Germans for their
unspeakable crimes toward the Jews.''
   Now that the division is ending, he said, ``the Jewish people
will have to take stock again of their attitude toward Germany.''
   One sensitive theme is the fear that unification will embolden
Germans to shrug off their awareness of the Holocaust.
   Professor Peter Pulzer, a refugee from Vienna now at Oxford
University, worries that, once Germany is united, ``a lot of
Germans who aren't racists or neo-Nazis may say, `OK, that's over;
we've drawn a line underneath the nasty bits.'''
   If one reason for dividing Germany was its Nazi past, Lanzmann
said, ``today this seems to be, if not forgotten, left aside. It
has become unimportant in a way.''
   Fears seem most acute among the generation old enough to
remember Nazi Germany. Shalom, an Italian Jewish monthly, surveyed
opinion and concluded: ``In general, optimism prevails among the
young and pessimism among those less young.''
   Most Jews acknowledge there is nothing they can do to stop
unification. ``What we must avoid at all costs ... is nostalgia''
for the old, Cold War order, said Alain Finkielkraut, a French
Jewish intellectual.
   Lord Jakobovits, chief rabbi of Britain, has been quoted as
calling for ``a chair for a Jewish spokesman'' at an international
conference on the shape of a new Germany. Other Jews say the Jews
could never agree who should represent them.
   ``We hope that Jewish victims of the Holocaust will have their
say in laying down rules and laws forbidding exclusion,
discrimination, racism and anti-Semitism of any kind,'' said Jean
Kahn, head of the Representative Council of French Jewish
Organizations.
   The European Jewish Congress, meeting last month in Brussels,
said the Jewish communities of Europe, ``which suffered so much
under the Third Reich, must express their preoccupations about a
reunited Germany.'' It said Germany should ``recognize now and
forever its collective responsibility for the Holocaust and its
victims.''

   Here are some quotations from European Jews who
have reacted in speeches, interviews and articles to the prospect
of German reunification:
   ``It is happening too soon; it is happening too fast.'' _ Claude
Lanzmann, French filmmaker who made the Holocaust documentary
``Shoah.''
   ``Amongst religious Jews ... there has been for a long time a
feeling toward Germany and toward Germans which is almost
apocalyptic in its implications. That is to say that the division
of Germany was somehow visited by the Almighty upon the Germans for
their unspeakable crimes toward the Jews, and that that division is
a symbol of divine wrath. That division is now coming to an end ..
. and the Jewish people will have to take stock again of their
attitude toward Germany.'' _ Geoffrey Alderman, British university
professor.
   ``It would be unwise to oppose unification. On the contrary, we
must welcome it with good will as a deep desire of the German
people. But we must get assurances that the new German generation
will respect all human values and any minority.'' _ Albert Guigui,
Belgian chief rabbi.
   ``You cannot argue from the past. If we were to argue from the
past, we would have to say that the major danger we perceive is
that the French will get to Moscow again as Napoleon did.'' _ Lord
Beloff, British historian.
   ``The Germans always were unpredictable. They become foolhardy
as soon as they feel strong. They have to be careful not to repeat
mistakes.'' _ Simon Wiesenthal, Nazi hunter based in Vienna.
   ``The Germans don't think any more about us. My feeling is that
the great majority of (German) people have other things on their
minds.'' _ Fiamma Nirenstein, Italian journalist.
   ``The fact that Israel is on the map makes Jews everywhere sleep
better.'' _ Ronnie Naftaniel, a spokesman for Dutch Jewry.

   Criminal proceedings are under way against 20
officials in connection with the deaths of 42 gold miners in a
snowstorm last year, the official Xinhua news agency reported
Saturday.
   The 20 were among 41 officials charged with corruption as part
of a nationwide campaign against wrongdoing that has badly tainted
the Communist Party's reputation.
   The charges were filed as a result of an investigation into the
miners' deaths last May. For more than a month, 8,000 gold
prospectors were stranded on the 16,400-foot-high Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau.
   Xinhua said an investigation into how the miners came to be
stranded revealed that provincial and municipal officials had
issued licenses to 28,000 individual gold miners last year,
violating a government ban on private prospecting, and had either
embezzled funds or accepted bribes worth $325,500.
   Those accused of wrongdoing include former Qinghai Gov. Song
Ruixiang and former Vice Gov. Ma Yuanbiao, Xinhua said.

   Pope John Paul II will meet with President
Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia next month during the pontiff's
visit to Prague, the Vatican said Saturday.
   The pope's 33-hour trip to Czechoslovakia will be his first
visit to a Warsaw Pact country other than his native Poland.
   The April 21-22 visit will include a visit to Havel in the
official presidential residence.
   Havel, a playwright, was a vigorous opponent of the former
Communist regime of Czechoslovakia. He came to power in the
peaceful revolution late last year that ended the Communists'
monopoly on power.
   Since the revolution in Czechoslovakia and similar upheavals in
East bloc countries, the Vatican has moved quickly to take
advantage of the new climate to boost the position of local Roman
Catholic churches.
   Last month the pope named five bishops for Czechoslovakia,
filling the country's 13 dioceses for the first time since World
War II. In the past, Communist regimes had blocked the nomination
of new bishops.

<TEXT>
   On the brink of its finale, the trial
of Joseph Hazelwood has become a battle of expert, high-priced
witnesses trying to unravel the tangled tale of the Exxon Valdez
skipper's seamanship.
   Prosecutors spent more than $140,000 to hire five experts. The
defense will spend perhaps half that on more experts to give
opinions on how well the skipper performed his job.
   ``You can't build a case totally on experts,'' said Thomas
Russo, one of Hazelwood's lawyers. ``But in any case where the
issues are not within common knowledge, experts are useful to
explain things to jurors.''
   Russo said the defense has tried to use experts less likely to
confuse or intimidate jurors: sea captains who sail, a naval
architect who builds ships and a computer expert who had never
before testified in a court.
   Prosecutors appeared to go for impressive credentials.
   Their toxicologist, Dr. Richard Prouty, spent more than an hour
reciting his qualifications before venturing the opinion that
Hazelwood probably was drunk on the crucial night. He said he has
testified more than 1,000 times.
   The case, with its discussions of rudder angles and nautical
miles, fathom markers and buoyancy, soundings and engine thrust,
has not been easy for a non-mariner to understand.
   For weeks, the courtroom of Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone
has been littered with huge nautical charts and diagrams tracking
the Exxon Valdez on its disastrous voyage through the Valdez
Narrows into Prince William Sound.
   There is a detailed, beautifully painted, color mockup of the
987-foot tanker that would be the envy of amateur model makers.
Expert witnesses carry it around and point out its features to the
jury. Another pull-apart model shows the ship's bridge. Lift off
the top and you can look down to the deck where the skipper sat in
his cabin during the grounding on March 24.
   It was just after midnight when the fully loaded tanker struck
Bligh Reef, spewing nearly 11 million gallons of oil into the clear
waters of scenic Prince William Sound. The spill, largest in U.S.
history, devastated the area's rich fisheries and wildlife and
fouled hundreds of miles of rocky shore.
   Was it an accident or a crime? That question underlies five
weeks of testimony. The jury's answer is likely to have
repercussions beyond the fairly mild charges against Hazelwood.
Civil suits abound and federal criminal charges have been filed
against Exxon.
   Hazelwood, 43, from Huntington, N.Y., is accused of one felony,
criminal mischief, and three misdemanors: reckless endangerment,
operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil.
   The trial began with testimony from those who saw Hazelwood in
the port town of Valdez on the day the ship sailed, crew members
who accompanied him and officers who carried out the ship's
carefully organized functions. Coast Guard officers and a state
trooper related their investigations.
   Then, Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole brought on his
experts.
   George Greiner Jr., a retired Coast Guardsman with a consulting
firm, said he figured Hazelwood had tried to move his stranded ship
off the reef after the grounding, risking capsizing and killing the
crew. The defense elicited his statement that the Exxon Valdez was
so deeply impaled that it could not have moved.
   Robert Beevers, a retired tanker captain, told jurors everything
that Hazelwood did was reckless. William Milwee Jr., a salvage
expert, said the Exxon Valdez could have capsized and sunk.
   On the crucial question of whether Hazelwood was drunk, the
state presented Prouty who ``calculated backwards'' to conclude
Hazelwood probably was drunk.
   He conceded there is dispute on his technique among scientists.
The defense is expected to offer an alcohol expert this week.
   The defense has called a naval architect, Edward Hoffman, to say
the ship would not have sunk even if dislodged from the reef. They
brought in computer whiz Peter Shizume who simulated the voyage and
found a simple rudder turn by the helmsman would have saved the
ship.
   A marine surveyor, Joseph Winer, analyzed charts to support the
conclusions. When court recessed for the weekend, a former tanker
captain, Shiras Walker, had declared Hazelwood was not reckless.
   ``I would have done exactly what Captain Hazelwood did,'' he
said. Walker faces cross-examination on Monday.

   A red-violet eclectus parrot, a green-wing macaw
and an ostrichlike emu are among the missing _ victims in a rash of
40 exotic birds thefts in the Miami area over the past five months.
   The popularity of the valuable tropical birds and federal limits
on imports have combined to produce a profitable black market in
birds, Ron Magill, assistant to the curator at Miami's MetroZoo,
said Friday.
   ``You see these birds that are stolen being sold everywhere from
classified advertising to flea markets,'' he said. ``I wouldn't be
surprised from what's going on now that some of these birds aren't
sold before they're stolen.''
   The 9-year-old zoo lost a female eclectus parrot valued at more
than $1,000 to someone who ducked into a screened breeding cage two
weeks ago while the staff member on duty was gone for about 20
minutes.
   ``The only other time that I know of that we had a theft of an
animal at MetroZoo since we opened was about five years ago at the
bird show area,'' said Magill.
   But the law of supply and demand is at work, even at the
criminal level.
   ``The population of these birds in the wild is becoming so
depleted that federal regulations are making it extremely difficult
to import them. Therefore the price is becoming very high on these
birds,'' he said. ``What's happening now is people are starting to
steal from the private owners and collectors in this country.''
   Warren and Jude Werner, stars of their Gold Coast Mime Co., used
a macaw named Miami Beak in their act until the $3,000 bird was
stolen from their Miami Beach home March 3.
   ``These were people who knew birds,'' Werner said. ``They didn't
take anything but the bird.''
   Susan Boyd, president of the Miami Parrot Club, improved
security after two blind eclectus parrots, two lovebirds and a
cockatoo were taken from her home Feb. 21. Two days later,
birdnappers struck again, this time making off another cockatoo and
a blue and gold macaw.
   Bird dealer Joe Wasilewski of Natural Selections lost four birds
in a break-in at his warehouse Dec. 27 but recovered three in a
police sting that resulted in two arrests. But he still misses the
fourth bird, a 7-year-old African gray named Lola. African grays
are considered the best talkers, or mimics, among parrots.
   ``She used to talk and sing and whistle and drive around with
me,'' he said. ``It's part of my family.''
   Victims suspect a ring is behind the spate of thefts dating back
to late October, Wasilewski said.
   ``If you don't have the training to handle them, you're going to
get bit,'' he said. ``They have to have training to steal all the
wide variety that they are.''

<HEAD>First Big Show of Rembrandt Landscapes Opens in Washington</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legend has it that Rembrandt once bet he could
prepare an etching of the Dutch countryside before a friend's
servant could fetch mustard from a nearby village.
   Rembrandt won the wager, according to the Frenchman responsible
for the tale, although it was not said how long the waiter took to
run his errand. The old master's spontaneous touch with a normally
slow and painstaking medium is known, and the results can be seen
Sunday through May 20 at Washington's National Gallery of Art.
   The etching, ``Six's Bridge,'' is part of the first major
exhibit devoted to Rembrandt's landscape prints and drawings. The
etching shows a canal, two boats, two bushes, a church, a bridge
and two men standing on it _ all on a plate 5 inches by 10 inches.
   Rembrandt is better known for his oil paintings, but only eight
of his surviving oils are landscapes. Largely scattered among
European museums, they are not among the 99 works in this exhibit,
though one of them can be seen in another part of the gallery.
   Etching can be one of the most difficult, time-consuming
processes, lending itself to tightly controlled, highly detailed
works.
   The works are begun on metal plates coated with a soft wax
formula. The artist cuts through the mixture with a needle so that
acid can bite into the resulting scratches on the plate, from which
the etching is later printed. Rembrandt took prepared plates with
him during his long walks around the city.
   Because of its self-imposed narrow scope, the exhibit contains
much of Rembrandt's most intimate work, homely scenes that roused
his personal interest: boats, bridges, churches, towers, cottages,
a man rowing a boat and an artist sketching by the road.
   This is the story told by Edme Francois Gersaint, who made the
first catalogue of Rembrandt's works more than 80 years after the
artist died in 1669:
   One overcast day in the year 1645 Rembrandt sat down to lunch at
the country house of his friend Jan Six, later mayor of Amsterdam,
when they made a discovery: there was no mustard. Six sent a
servant to the village.
   ``Rembrandt knew how slow servants usually are in his country:
when they reply `anstons,' which means `right away,' they take at
least half an hour to appear,'' wrote Gersaint in one of the few
stories about the artist.
   So Rembrandt made the bet.
   Art history professor Cynthia P. Schneider of Georgetown
University calls the story ``apocryphal.'' But she added in the
catalogue for this exhibit that the work was a miracle of artistic
economy.
   ``The swift and spare strokes of the etching have all the
freedom of a sketch from life,'' she said.
   She also pointed out that it is done from a low viewpoint, as if
the artist were sitting on the ground. Gersaint said it was the
scene from the window of the room the two men were in.
   A Dutch scholar has claimed to identify the church and Six's
property along the Amstel River in the suburbs of Amsterdam. Then
it was called Klein-Kostverloren, ``Little Money-Lost.'' How much
was the bet? Are those the two friends on the bridge?
   The show will not travel elsewhere after closing in Washington.
Roger Mandle, the gallery's deputy director, said he expected large
crowds but did not intend to use a ticket system unless they get
too big for comfortable viewing.

   Abortion-rights advocates can expect to have
at least three new allies in Congress next year, according to a
survey of candidates running in 79 key House and Senate races.
   The survey by Congressional Quarterly magazine also found the
abortion issue is causing internal conflicts among party members in
both Democratic and Republican primaries.
   The magazine found many candidates are trying to stake out
positions somewhere between ``pro-choice'' and ``pro-life.''
   In at least three cases, the magazine reported, anti-abortion
incumbents are retiring and all the candidates running to succeed
them favor abortion rights.
   The races are for the Senate seat from Colorado being vacated by
Republican Sen. William Armstrong, the House seat held by retiring
Rep. Wes Watkins, D-Okla., and the New York seat vacated by
Republican Rep. Guy Molinari, who resigned to become borough
president for Staten Island.
   The survey focused on open seats and close contests for 16
Senate and 63 House seats. It found 23 races in which
abortion-rights Democrats face anti-abortion Republicans.
   But it also found the issue is not purely partisan:
   _In 15 contests, the leading candidates of both parties support
abortion rights; in 14 races, both oppose abortion.
   _Democratic candidates disagreed on abortion in 10 of the
primary races surveyed, while Republicans disagreed among
themselves in 12 primary contests.
   _In at least one competitive House race, an anti-abortion
Democrat faces a pro-choice Republican. The Democrat is Rep. George
Sangmeister of Illinois. His opponent is insurance broker Manny
Hoffman.
   Congressional Quarterly said its survey found many candidates
are trying to find a middle position that will appeal to voters not
allied with either side in the abortion debate.
   In nine of the 14 races that involve only abortion opponents,
the magazine said, at least one candidate supports federal funding
of abortions for poor women in cases of rape or incest. It said
many pro-choice candidates, meanwhile, are wary of opposing
parental involvement in abortion decisions by minors.
   CQ, a weekly publication about Congress, conducted its telephone
survey between Feb. 16 and March 8. Some candidates' positions may
have changed since then, the authors said.

   The son of Nationalist Chinese leader
Chiang Kai-shek withdrew his candidacy Saturday for vice president
in a contest that had threatened an unprecedented split in the
governing party.
   Chiang Wego pulled out of the race a day after his running mate,
popular judicial chief Lin Yang-kang, decided against challenging
President Lee Teng-hui in the presidential election March 21.
   ``I will follow the steps of Mr. Lin Yang-kang,'' Chiang, 73,
told reporters.
   The Nationalist Party's 180-member central committee unanimously
backed Lee's candidacy for a six-year presidential term last month.
But Lee, 67, angered elderly party members when he rejected their
choice of Chiang as his running mate and instead selected
presidential adviser Li Yuan-zu, 66.
   The elderly party members retaliated by endorsing Lin, 62, and
Chiang as a rival team to contest the election.
   Taiwan's 752-seat National Assembly, which will elect the
president, is dominated by the elderly legislators. They fled to
Taiwan in 1949 when the Nationalists lost a civil war on the
Chinese mainland to Communist forces.
   The elders have been frozen in office to support the Nationalist
claim of being the legitimate government of all China. They are
concerned that Lee's pragmatic policies toward the rival Communist
government will weaken their dream to reunify China under
Nationalist rule.
   Lee is the first native Taiwanese to head the Nationalist
government. He was elevated to the post from the vice presidency in
1988 when President Chiang Ching-kuo died.
   Chiang Wego, a retired general and Chiang Ching-kuo's half
brother, is viewed by many of the older assemblymen as the defender
of their nationalistic ambitions. He is the sole surviving son of
Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek.
   He said earlier that he would not actively campaign for the vice
presidency, but would not discourage the electoral college from
supporting him.
   His stand has been criticized, most recently on Friday when his
nephew, Chiang Hsiao-wu, accused him of ``wanting to be elected but
claiming he would not campaign.''
   Chiang Hsiao-wu, the son of Chiang Ching-kuo, is head of
Taiwan's unofficial diplomatic mission in Japan.
   The opposition Democratic Progressive Party has accused Chiang
Wego of using his influence with Taiwan's military to block native
Taiwanese from gaining power in the government.
   The Democratic Progressive Party, formed three years ago by
Taiwanese, does not have enough members in the National Assembly to
nominate its own candidate for president.

   Police opened fire and killed two Hindu
fundamentalists Saturday in an attempt to break up a fight between
political groups protesting the killing of 34 Hindus by Sikh
militants, authorities said.
   An indefinite curfew was clamped on the town of Abohar in Punjab
state after the shooting, which also injured 15 people, said Deputy
Commissioner Rakesh Singh.
   He said members of the opposition Congress Party and the Hindu
fundamentalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or National
Self-Service League, were separately protesting the killing of 34
people Wednesday in an attack by Sikh militants.
   The two groups began throwing stones at each other, Singh said,
and police opened fire to control the situation. The officer did
not know why the two groups began fighting.
   Singh was contacted by telephone from Amritsar, a town about 100
miles to the north of Abohar. Amritsar is the focal point of the
8-year-old Sikh militant campaign for an independent nation in
Punjab state.
   The campaign has resulted in at least 318 deaths in Punjab this
year. Most were killed in attacks by militants.
   On Wednesday, Sikh militants opened fire in Abohar's main market
and left timed explosives before escaping from the area. All the
victims were Hindus.
   Sikhs are in a slight majority in Punjab state but form only 2
percent of India's 880 million people.
   Sikh militants claim their community is discriminated against by
Hindus, who make up 82 percent of the nation's population.

<TEXT>
   A 6-year-old girl who suffered severe burns in the
crash last month of an Indian Airlines jet near Bangalore died
Saturday, bringing the death toll to 93 people.
   Rakhee Patel died at Mount Vernon Hospital in Northwood,
Middlesex, just north of London, a hospital spokesman said.
Surgeons on Feb. 20 performed a rare graft using skin from a dead
donor in an effort to save her life.
   ``Despite the efforts of a team of plastic surgeons, Rakhee
succumbed to her very serious burn injuries,'' said the spokesman,
who was not identified.
   The senior plastic surgeon, Dr. Nigel Mercer, said Rakhee
suffered burns over 85 percent of her body when the Indian Airlines
Airbus crashed short of the runway at the Indian city of Bangalore
on Feb. 14.
   The jet carried 146 people, including Rakhee's parents, Jaisukh
and Neeta Patel. They were injured.
   Their relatives raised thousands of dollars to fly Rakhee, her
parents and younger sister to Britain for hospital treatment. A
relative said the other members of Rakhee's family were
hospitalized in stable condition.
   The cause of the crash has not been determined.

<TEXT>
   The government has named Wilson Ndolo Ayah
as Kenya's new foreign minister. He replaces Robert Ouko, who was
slain last month.
   President Daniel arap Moi announced Ayah's appointment on Friday
along with three other Cabinet changes. Ayah had been Moi's
minister for water development.
   Ayah, 57, entered politics in 1969, winning a parliamentary seat
from western Kisumu, the same region Ouko represented in Parliament.
   He was named assistant minister for finance in 1987 and later
served as minister for research, science and technology. He was
given the water portfolio in 1988.
   Ayah holds a master's degree in agricultural economics from the
University of Wisconsin.
   Ouko's partly burned body was found near his home in western
Kenya three weeks ago. He had been shot once in the head. An
investigation into his slaying continues.
   In other Cabinet changes, Onyango Midika, an assistant minister
for labor, was named minister for regional development. He replaced
John Okwanyo, who took Ayah's former chair in the water ministry.
John Ryalo, a member of Parliament, was named minister of state in
the president's office. He replaced Johnstone Makau, who was fired
last week.

<TEXT>
   The army said Saturday that it repelled
three rebel attacks on the strategic southern town of Yei last week
in fighting that killed 40 rebels and one army soldier.
   A military communique said six government soldiers and scores of
rebels were wounded in the battles Tuesday and Wednesday. The
official Sudan News Agency distributed the communique.
   Forces of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army attacked Yei,
800 miles southwest of Khartoum, three times using tanks, artillery
and rocket launchers, according to the communique.
   Government soldiers captured a rebel tank and its driver, as
well as large quantities of ammunition and arms, it said.
   Yei is near the borders of Zaire and Uganda. It is important
because many supplies for Juba, the region's capital, are trucked
to Yei across the borders before going on to Juba.
   The rebels claimed several weeks ago that they controlled the
Yei-Juba highway, but the government denied this.
   Elaborating on the communique, Chief of Staff Gen. Ishak Ibrahim
Omar said that two rebel battalions were routed in the Yei fighting.
   He said the army also had repulsed two rebel attacks in other
areas of the Equatoria and Bahr el-Ghazal regions with unspecified
``heavy losses'' on the rebel side.
   The rebel army took up arms against the government in 1983. It
demands greater autonomy in the south from the Moslem-dominated
government, as well as administrative and economic reforms.

   Civil rights activists commemorating the
25th anniversary of the Selma-to-Montgomery march began their final
walk toward Alabama's Capitol today, chanting and singing their way
through the Cradle of the Confederacy.
   ``We could not stop in Montgomery in 1965. We cannot stop
today,'' Jesse Jackson told marchers lining up. ``We've got to go
on to Washington, where there's the budget to shift national
priorities.''
   A mostly black crowd of about 1,000 marchers began the two-mile
walk to downtown Montgomery, where 25,000 people gathered in 1965
to demand voting rights for blacks. In both marches they headed for
the white-domed Capitol, where Jefferson Davis was sworn in as
president of the Confederacy. The Rebel banner still flies over the
building, despite protests by blacks.
   Jackson and others, including Coretta Scott King, the widow of
the Martin Luther King Jr., and U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., were
scheduled to speak on the Capitol steps.
   On Friday night, actor Lou Gossett Jr. acted as master of
ceremonies for a program featuring musical styles ranging from
Broadway to rap in an attempt to draw a huge crowd for today's
march.
   Singer Melba Moore, rap artist Jessie West and civil rights
activist-comedian Dick Gregory were some of the celebrities on hand.
   ``You have to carry it on,'' Gossett told the cheering crowd of
about 2,000 people. ``You have to carry it in your hearts, in your
lifestyles ... You have to think about it and carry it on.''
   In 1965, Peter, Paul and Mary, Harry Belafonte, Joan Baez and
other entertainers performed the night before the march to help
drum up a crowd.
   This week about 150 people made the 50-mile walk along the
four-lane highway linking Selma with Montgomery, and an organizer
said it was an invigorating experience for young and old.
   ``I think we're talking about reclaiming the values of the
past,'' said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference. ``I don't think the 1990s will get
by like the 80s.''

<HEAD>Nations Raise Holdings of Foreign Currencies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States led the way last year as
central banks around the world raised their holdings of foreign
currency to a record $768 billion, the International Monetary Fund
reported.
   The holdings reflect efforts by industrialized countries to
influence trade through international exchange rates and by Third
World countries to stockpile cash for emergencies. Last year's
worldwide level was $726 billion.
   The holdings do not include gold.
   The largest increase was in total U.S. holdings of foreign
currency, especially West German marks and Japanese yen, IMF said
in its March compilation of international financial statistics.
   Total U.S. holdings at the end of 1989 were valued at $63.3
billion, up from $36.9 billion in 1988, IMF reported. Japan held
$83.7 billion worth of reserves, down from $97 billion at the end
of 1988.
   ``The United States and Japan were both trying to keep the price
of the dollar low so that the United States could sell more goods,
and Japan and others would buy more,'' said Robert Solomon of the
Brookings Institution, a private policy studies group.
   ``So the United States sold a lot of dollars to push the price
down and got a lot of yen and marks in return.''
   Solomon is a former adviser to the board of governors of the
Federal Reserve System, the American central bank.
   ``The Japanese were trying to buy more American goods, so they
sold some of their dollars to push the price down,'' Solomon
explained.
   A lower price for the dollar makes American goods cheaper and
more attractive to Japanese. When the dollar is cheaper, the yen is
more expensive. That makes Japanese goods less attractive to
Americans.
   Both effects tend to lower the U.S. deficit in world trade,
which dropped to $108.6 billion in 1989. That deficit was still a
major world problem though it was down by more than $10 billion
from the year before.
   Like other market operations, government buying and selling of
currencies does not always work as well as intended. Japanese
authorities have been complaining that the dollar has risen lately
despite the intervention. It rose once again on Friday, to more
than 151 yen and 1.7 marks.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and finance ministers of
six other major industrial countries have just called a meeting in
Paris for April 7. Ups and downs of the dollar and other currencies
will be a major topic.
   In most of the Third World, reserves are an insurance against a
rainy day when a country needs to buy more goods abroad than it can
earn by selling its own products.
   Reserves rose for 130 Third World countries to a record $267
billion, the fund reported.

   Ah, spring: When young folks' fancies
lightly turn to thoughts of suds, sex, sunburn, loud music, wet
T-shirt and belly flop contests at this, ``The World's Most Famous
Beach.''
   A local task force, hoping this year to minimize the
bacchanalian havoc wrought by 400,000 booze-guzzling collegians, is
trying to slow down the fast times with a campaign to ``Party
Smart'' in Daytona.
   ``The theme means enjoy yourself, have a great time, be safe, go
home safe and having had a wonderful time, come back in 1991,''
said Ray Eddy, chairman of the task force.
   Beach Police Chief John Kirvan said laws barring alcohol on the
beach will be strictly enforced, and his officers will take a
``no-nonsense approach to drinking and rowdyism.''
   Little else has changed in this year's student pilgrimage, which
began in early March and continues through mid-April.
   MTV, the cable TV music channel which helped establish the area
as a spring break mecca, is returning. So is Playboy magazine,
National Lampoon and the rock concerts, product displays, beauty
pageants and sporting events. Breweries, automakers and sun product
companies will vie for student attention. This year, condom
manufacturer Carter-Wallace Inc. will introduce ``Trojan Man'' to
promote the need for safe sex.
   Parker Brothers is unveiling its new water- or air-filled Oopee
ball.
   And there's 28 miles of hard-packed beach, where each year the
swimsuits of men and women get a little more daring and ogling is a
popular pastime for both sexes.
   Daytona Beach has been the spring break mecca for sun-starved
Northern college students for about three years, since Fort
Lauderdale let it be known that spring breakers were not welcome.
   Last year, some Daytonans grew tired of drunken excesses,
property destruction, under-age drinking, gridlocked traffic and
public urination. They urged officials to pull in the welcome mat.
   Hoping to keep the economic boon that will put an estimated $120
million into the local economy this year, the Daytona Beach Spring
Break Festival Task Force was formed to make the partying more
bearable for the locals.
   It has tripled available parking, increased trash receptacles
and planted 100 portable toilets and hopes to control illegal
drinking. It has organized activities for students and even created
a code of conduct, Eddy said.
   The Daytona Beach police and the Volusia County Beach Patrol are
pledging beefed-up forces and stringent enforcement of laws,
especially those involving alcohol. Noise-control ordinances also
will be enforced.
   ``Our problems haven't been with the college kids,'' said
Daytona Police Chief Paul Crow. Contrary to public perceptions,
Crow said, about 65 percent of those arrested last year were
Florida youths, many under-age high schoolers. The task force is
doing its best to ``un-invite'' high schoolers who skip classes and
try to participate in activities designed for college-age students.
   As a result, the names of rock groups giving spring break
concerts will not be publicized to anyone other than those staying
at the beach.
   This year, Crow said police will restrict traffic to the beaches
when they fill to help prevent gridlock. ``We are going to close
the gate,'' Crow said.
   New city ordinances aimed at maintaining a more orderly crowd
will close bars at 2 a.m., instead of 3 a.m. Hotels and motels
cannot serve beer on pool decks until after 2 p.m. and must close
the taps at 11 p.m.
   Wristbands will be issued to identify students who are 21, the
legal drinking age in Florida.
   Task force members hope their plans will save spring break at
Daytona.
   The first of an estimated 100,000 spring breakers also have
begun arriving at coastal Texas' South Padre and Mustang islands,
where Chamber of Commerce officials report 90 percent occupancy
next weekend at hotels and motels.
   Police and Nueces County authorities will be bolstered by state
police and officers of the state Alcohol Beverage Commission, said
Constable DeeWayne Mathews.
   ``Our problem is the alcohol and the long, long hours they spend
on the beach,'' Matthews said. ``You sit there and drink for 24
hours, you have a tendency to get drunk.''

   A lone trumpeter played taps and a
helicopter dropped flower petals from above Saturday as 1,000
mourners buried a popular army officer who was killed while trying
to arrest a rebellious governor.
   The coffin bearing Brig. Gen. Oscar Florendo's body was lowered
into a concrete tomb after a three-gun salute. Relatives, close
friends and even some reporters cried openly as the trumpeter
played and the flowers rained down.
   Florendo, chief of the military's civil relations office and a
popular former armed forces spokesman, was slain March 4 in the
northern Philippines.
   He died during a clash between government troops and supporters
of a suspended governor accused of taking part in December's coup
attempt. The troops were called in after supporters of the
governor, Rodolfo Aguinaldo, resisted attempts to arrest him and
took Florendo hostage.
   Aguinaldo escaped during the confusion and remained at large
Saturday. On Thursday, he said from hiding that he took
responsibility for Florendo's death, and he called it a ``terrible
mistake.''
   At least 150 vehicles formed a convoy that brought Florendo's
coffin from Camp Aguinaldo, the armed forces headquarters in
suburban Manila, to Heroes Cemetery nine miles to the south. Many
people living along the route lighted candles and offered prayers
as the hearse passed.
   Eight brigadier generals, all Florendo's classmates at the elite
Philippine Military Academy, acted as pallbearers and carried his
coffin to a jeep-drawn cart that carried it the final 200 yards to
the burial site.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos, a former armed forces chief of
staff who had worked closely with Florendo, said after the funeral
that the general was ``a special person whose sincerity and
compassion is unmatched among our own personnel in the armed forces
as well as in government.''
   Sen. Ernesto Maceda, who also attended the funeral, said he
hoped Florendo's death ``will shock us into reality and do some
soul searching in order to gain the determination to unite for
peace.''
   ``When will this syndrome of violence that we are seeing every
day end?'' said Maceda, chairman of the Senate Defense Committee.
   Florendo had been trying to serve an arrest warrant on
Aguinaldo, the suspended governor of northern Cagayan province in
connection with the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt. At least 113 people died
and more than 600 were wounded in the coup try.
   Aguinaldo made a broadcast the first day of the coup declaring
his support for the rebel soldiers and offering to send ``artillery
and armor'' to Manila.
   After four days of trying to persuade Aguinaldo to surrender,
the governor and his supporters seized a hotel in Cagayan's
capital, Tuguegarao, took Florendo hostage and trapped several
other military and government officials.
   Florendo and 11 other people died during fighting when
government troops recaptured the hotel.

   A robber who broke into a home and held the owner
at knifepoint apparently decided his victim was worse off than he
was and gave back the $8 he was going to steal.
   ``I think he was disgusted,'' said the 32-year-old victim.
   The thief came into the house through an unlocked carport door
early Friday and jumped on the victim, who was in bed. There was a
brief struggle in which the victim was hit several times on the
head with the butt of the knife.
   The victim said the robber ransacked his room, scooping up a
watch, rings, $3 in change and $5 from his wallet.
   ``This house is not worth robbing,'' the thief suddenly said,
giving back the money. But he kept the six rings and a watch valued
at $61, according to a police report.
   ``He couldn't believe that was all the money I had,'' the victim
said. ``He just dumped it in my hands and left.''

   An inmate escaped from prison one day
before he was to be released, and now faces up to 20 years in
prison if recaptured.
   Donald M. Thomas, 34, of Newport, began serving a 90-day term
for disorderly conduct Dec. 8 at the Adult Correctional Institution
and his release papers were to have been handed to him Friday.
   Thomas was reported missing at 2:55 p.m. Thursday, shortly after
he and 14 other prisoners returned to the minimum-security unit
from an off-grounds work detail, said prison spokesman Joseph
DiNitto.
   Thomas apparently got out of the van and hid behind it as
several other work crews arrived and went into the prison, then he
fled. A few minutes later, guards conducted a head count and
realized someone was missing.
   ``For the life of me I don't know what possessed him to leave
with only one day of his sentence left to serve,'' said DiNitto.
   Thomas was still missing Saturday.
   DiNitto said once Thomas is captured he will be arraigned on a
charge of escaping, which carries a sentence of one to 20 years.

   Two women convicted in the 1985 drowning
of a teen-ager linked romantically with their boyfriends were
sentenced to 15 years to life in prison.
   Karen Severson and Laura Doyle, both 22 and of Arleta, were
sentenced in Superior Court Friday after jurors found them guilty
of second-degree murder.
   They were convicted of killing Michele ``Missy'' Avila, 17, by
holding her head under ankle-deep water in a stream in Big Tujuna
Canyon in Angeles National Forest.
   Judge Jack B. Tso dismissed defense pleas for leniency, saying
the brutality of the crime justified a maximum penalty. Defense
lawyers argued that the women had troubled childhoods and drug
problems.
   The prosecution's key witness was a woman who testified that she
saw the two defendants push Miss Avila down a path toward the
creek, accusing her of having had sex with their boyfriends. Hikers
found the girl's body three days later.

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seattle Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen has
canceled plans to train more deacons until the role of women in the
Roman Catholic Church is addressed more thoroughly.
   Women are not allowed to be deacons.
   ``Many women and men told us that the church didn't seem to
respect the personhood of women, that the church was patriarchal
and unappreciative of women's gifts,'' said Hunthausen, who with
Coadjutor Archbishop Thomas Murphy is helping the U.S. Catholic
bishops to write a pastoral letter, ``Women in Society and the
Church.''
   Some priests, deacons and lay Catholics praised the archbishop's
decision in calling attention to women's role in the church, but
others said they thought it would have no effect other than slowing
the flow of deacons into parishes.
   Deacons perform considerable work in some parishes, such as
administering the sacraments of baptism and marriage.

<HEAD>Dismissal of Ethics Complaint Caps Gingrich's Political Ascent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Richard Nixon was making his
first visit to the House since being driven from office by the
Watergate scandal when Rep. Newt Gingrich learned that his own
ethics cloud had evaporated.
   Gingrich, second-ranking Republican in the House, said it was
during Nixon's hourlong meeting Thursday with GOP members of
Congress that he was handed the letter ending 11 ``psychologically
difficult'' months.
   The letter said the committee had dismissed ethics complaints
brought by Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., against the Georgia
lawmaker after he had caused the investigation that led to the
resignation of former Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.
   The committee, however, criticized Gingrich for not reporting on
his annual financial disclosure forms that he had co-signed the
mortgage on his daughter's home. It also criticized Gingrich for
his staff's use of official letterhead to promote a private
company's senior citizens cruise.
   But on each of Alexander's major allegations of misconduct, the
committee said it found that ``no adequate basis'' existed to
launch a full-scale ethics investigation.
   Most of the allegations focused on a partnership Gingrich
created in 1984 to promote a book he helped write, ``Window of
Opportunity.'' Alexander contended Gingrich had violated House
rules on gifts and outside income, as well as federal campaign
finance laws, with the partnership and book deal.
   The committee's letter capped Gingrich's meteoric rise _ in less
than two years _ from a back-bench Republican firebrand to the
leading contender to replace 67-year-old Republican leader Bob
Michel when he retires.
   Along the way, Gingrich's tactics made him the target of choice
for House Democrats.
   Gingrich compiled lists of Democrats he claimed should be
investigated, he traveled the country denouncing ``House Democratic
corruption'' and he filed the complaint that led the ethics
committee to charge Wright with 69 violations of House rules,
including charges that he accepted $145,000 in gifts from a Fort
Worth, Texas, business executive.
   As the ethics investigation grew more serious for Wright, House
Republicans rewarded Gingrich by electing him whip last year when
Dick Cheney left the job to become secretary of Defense. Democrats
vowed revenge when Wright decided to resign last June.
   ``There's no question Democrats were mad as hell and wanted to
pin him to the wall'' after Wright was forced from office, said
Thomas Mann, a congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution.
   But Mann said Gingrich benefited both from the changed
atmosphere in the House since Wright's resignation and from the
apparent weakness of the charges.
   ``Politically motivated charges aren't going to go anywhere
unless there's something really there to begin with and unless the
overall atmosphere that made it possible remains the same,'' he
said.
   When he resigned, Wright called for an end to ``mindless
cannibalism,'' and the new Democratic leadership team moved to
reduce the partisan tone in the House.
   But Gingrich said he's convinced the committee would have
reached the same conclusion in his case anyway.
   ``On item after item after item, they said there is no grounds
for these charges,'' Gingrich said. ``So my presumption is that
even in a more intensely partisan environment, the truth beats
passion in the end.''
   With the ethics case resolved in Gingrich's favor, Mann
predicted, Democrats likely will reorient their campaign but not
abandon it.
   ``They still want to get him, but I think it will switch from
ethics and legal wars to political wars,'' he said.

   ``In view of continuing civil disturbances in various parts of
Haiti, the Department of State recommends that American citizens
defer all non-essential travel to Haiti at this time,'' a
department statement said.
   The department said that although there did not appear to be any

and avoid crowds and areas affected by current unrest.
   The department said U.S. citizens who do travel to Haiti should
register upon arrival with the consular section of the American

   Zsa Zsa Gabor, who sued Delta Air Lines for $10
million after she was ejected from a flight for letting her dogs
roam free, has had her lawsuit tossed out of court for the moment,
a federal judge said Saturday.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler said Miss Gabor's attorneys
can refile the complaint once they fix its flaws.
   Miss Gabor sued alleging negligence, defamation and assault and
battery after she was removed from Flight 462 while stopping in
Atlanta en route from Los Angeles to West Palm Beach on Jan. 6,
1989.
   A flight attendant and the pilot asked their first-class
passenger to put her dogs Genghis Kahn and Macho Man in her
carry-on kennel, but she refused.
   ``You know Zsa Zsa. She'll speak her mind,'' said her lawyer,
Donald Norton. ``She told the stewardess what she thought of her.''
   Norton said only one dog was loose and that the argument was
over Miss Gabor's refusal to put a jewel-filled Gucci bag in an
overhead compartment.
   In Atlanta, a Delta vice president boarded the Boeing 767 to ask
again, but the airline said she rejected the requests with
``considerable vulgarity'' and was escorted off the flight by a
police officer.
   The incident occurred before Miss Gabor's celebrated run-in with
a Beverly Hills motorcycle officer on June 14. She is appealing a
three-day jail sentence; and the officer is suing her for $10
million, charging slander, emotional distress and assault and
battery.

   Teen-age actor Corey Feldman was arrested for
alleged heroin possession after several balloons containing the
drug were found in his car, police said.
   Feldman, 18, was booked for investigation of possessing
narcotics late Friday, said police Sgt. Thomas Jones, adding the
quantity of heroin was described as ``numerous balloons'' _ the
street packaging for the drug.
   Feldman, who has appeared in such films as ``The Goonies,''
``Dream A Little Dream'' and ``The Bad News Bears'' TV series, was
released on bail early Saturday.
   Details of the arrest following a traffic stop were not
disclosed, although Jones said Feldman was the only person in the

   A weapons charge has been dropped against New
York Mets outfielder Darryl Strawberry, who finished a 27-day stay
in an alcohol rehabilitation clinic earlier this month, prosecutors
said.
   The charge, which stemmed from a domestic dispute in January,
will not be prosecuted because of insufficient evidence. A further
charge of spousal battery will not be filed, City Attorney James K.
Hahn said.
   Strawberry, 27, was booked for investigation of assault with a
deadly weapon on Jan. 26 after a dispute with his wife at their
Encino home.
   Police said Lisa Strawberry, 25, accused her husband of
threatening her with a gun that was registered to her. However, she
later told the city attorney's office she did not want her husband
to be prosecuted.
   Strawberry, who is participating in the Mets Assistance Program,
has agreed to provide prosecutors with biweekly written progress
reports for three months, while continuing alcohol counseling and
beginning family counseling, Hahn said.
   The decision not to prosecute was reached after hearings
involving Strawberry's wife and her mother, Virginia Andrews, and
an ``especially frank'' discussion with Strawberry, the city
attorney's office said.

   Actor Ralph Waite, who played the Blue
Ridge Mountains patriarch on the long-running television series
``The Waltons,'' wants a seat in Congress.
   Waite, 61, of Rancho Mirage filed papers Thursday to enter the
37th Congressional District race. The self-described moderate
Democrat hopes to unseat Republican Rep. Al McCandless of La Quinta.
   Waite said he hoped to capitalize on his role as John Walton in
the family series that ran from 1972 to 1980, to sway a heavily
Republican district.
   ``I'm glad for that background and image,'' Waite said.
   He said he will probably need $900,000 to beat McCandless, a
four-term congressman who has handily defeated all opponents since
his election in 1982.
   There are two other Democratic candidates in the race, Johnny
Pearson of the Lake Elsinore area and Jeffrey Jacobs of Moreno
Valley. The district covers most of Riverside County.

   Liz Taylor, Roberto Duran and a pack of
marauding mussels all came to Congress this past week, in one form
or another.
   If you thought your representatives spent all week on such
weighty matters as aid for Eastern Europe and the Clean Air bill,
think again.
   Most members of Congress devote only a small portion of their
days to such pursuits. Just as many hours, and usually many more,
are spent on keeping constituents happy, getting one's picture or
name mentioned in the hometown or national press, attending
receptions, and lavishing praise on colleagues and witnesses.
   A typical two-hour congressional hearing, for example, will
devote 20 minutes or so to rituals of accolade. The Democratic
chairman of the committee praises a colleague for helping prepare
the session; the ranking Republican praises the chairman for
holding the hearing; the members praise the witness _ an
administration official or specialist of some sort _ for his or her
work on the subject, and so on.
   With some 250 committees and subcommittees in Congress, the 100
Senate members and their 435 colleagues in the House are busy
people. Most sit on three or four committees, which is where most
congressional action is taken.
   Except during floor votes, the main chambers of the House and
Senate are virtually empty, with only a speaker on the podium and a
stray clerk or usher in the aisles.
   More often than not, lawmakers will stay away from a plenary
session to make time for a meeting with constituents visiting
Washington. After all, these are the people who will get them
re-elected.
   On a recent day, Rep. Dave McCurdy's schedule had 15 constituent
visits. Aides to the Oklahoma Democrat say this is an unusally
heavy load, although not rare.
   McCurdy and his colleagues also have to travel to their home
districts periodically to meet with voters and tend to local
business. Last year, McCurdy flew home 11 times.
   No wonder, then, that much of the work on Capitol Hill gets
accomplished by staff members rather than by the lawmakers
themselves. Most members have a staff of about 20, although some _
especially if they chair influential committees _ have double that.
In all, Congress employs about 20,000 people _ including security
police, cleaners and clerks.
   While visits by foreign visitors _ presidents, prime ministers
and the like _ usually get bigger headlines, American celebrities
are often a much bigger draw at the Capitol itself.
   Elizabeth Taylor came to Capitol Hill to lobby for a bill that
would give $600 million to AIDS sufferers.
   Although Congress has been discussing the proposed bill for
weeks, Miss Taylor's appearance at a hearing and a news conference
drew dozens of lawmakers eager to shake her hand or stare into her
famous violet eyes.
   ``It took Elizabeth Taylor to get you to one of my hearings,''
the panel's chairman, California Rep. Barbara Boxer, admonished her
Democratic colleague from Illinois, Richard Durbin.
   Dante Fascell, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
made time last week for boxer Roberto Duran. The former
welterweight champion came to Congress to seek aid for his native
Panama, food for hungry children and housing for Panamanians left
homeless by the U.S. invasion last December.
   And then there were the marauding mollusks.
   Reporters on Capitol Hill, sifting through their mail boxes,
pulled out a plastic bag stuffed with mussel shells appended to a
press release.
   ``Sen. John Glenn and Rep. Henry Nowak today proposed a $40
million plan to control the zebra mussel, the small shellfish
attacking water intake pipes and creating environmental problems in
the Great Lakes,'' the release said.
   Glenn was joined at a news conference by seven lawmakers
battling the spread of the mollusks, which reached the Great Lakes
by stowing away on freighters from Europe.
   ``I can tell you it's no joke,'' Glenn said.

<HEAD>Recall Election Highlights Growth, Leadership Issues</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A recall election on Tuesday, the second time
in a month residents will cast ballots, is shaping up as a battle
between old-timers who favor slow growth and newcomers who say
development is vital to the economy.
   Voters must decide whether to recall four-term Mayor Bill
Stirling and three other city councilmen _ Steve Crockett, Frank
Peters and Michael Gassman.
   Their critics say the four run a confrontational and
unprofessional government and have done little to solve pressing
housing and traffic problems. Also, they have been accused of being
rude to constituents and promoting favorite causes _ as in
Stirling's widely publicized campaign to ban fur sales, which
failed in an election Feb. 13.
   The four members of the five-member council drew the ire of many
when they opposed a large-scale Ritz-Carlton Hotel at the base of
Aspen mountain.
   Residents voted 60 percent to 40 percent in February to let
developer Mohamed Hadid build a 292-room, 66-foot-tall, $70 million
luxury hotel. Stirling and his supporters on the council wanted to
scale back the hotel's size by 25 percent and down to 44 feet high.
   The slow-growth advocates who have dominated city and county
politics for decades fear they are becoming suddenly unfashionable.
   Voter approval of the hotel ``was a real big departure _ an
aberration,'' said Michael Kinsley, a Pitkin County commissioner
from 1975 to 1985. ``For the last several years, nobody has been
elected to office who explicitly favored growth. And this election
approved a major hotel.''
   Kinsley, who had favored the scaled-back hotel plan, attributed
the vote to intensive lobbying and campaign spending by Hadid.
   The strongest supporters of the hotel came from more recent
arrivals to Aspen, from the wealthy, and from people who call
themselves moderates or conservatives, according to an Aspen Times
Daily exit poll Feb. 13. About 70 percent of the town's 3,700
registered voters turned out for that election.
   Supporters of the larger hotel plan say voters simply recognized
the reality that Aspen has become a world-class resort.
   ``This town's 15 years behind the times as far as
accommodations,'' said Don Kopf, 61, a contractor who passes out
recall buttons.
   He believes the City Council has failed to direct growth and has
let the housing problem reach crisis dimensions. ``Government
should be run like a business, not like a fraternity,'' he said.
   Kopf accuses those in power of trying to close the door on
future development. ``It's an attitude that, `I've got mine, you
can't have yours.'''
   Carol Craig, an Aspenite for 34 years and a volunteer at the
Thrift Shop, opposed both the larger hotel and a measure approved
by voters to widen and straighten Highway 82 into town. She says
the roads should be closed to cars entirely.
   ``That would preserve the essence of Aspen,'' she says. ``People
come here for the beauty and the security of the place.''
   In the recall election, voters will vote first on whether to
recall each councilman, then may vote on a candidate to replace him.
   Stirling's post is being sought by Wainwright Dawson, 54, a
management consultant and former Stirling aide; and Terry Butler,
who lost to Stirling in last year's mayoral race.
   Rick Head, Margot Pendleton, Augie Reno and Ward Hauenstein seek
to serve the remaining three years of Crockett's and Peters' terms.
Marcia Goshorn is running to replace Gassman, whose term is up this
fall.
   Of the four subjected to a recall, Crockett is considered the
most vulnerable. Critics say he made fun of a speaker at a city
council meeting. He also was accused of calling tourists
``parasites'' on national television, but provided videotape
disproving that charge. His accusers, however, refuse to apologize.
   Stirling, who departed from his usual laid-back style and began
taking out newspaper ads a month before this election, said there's
a new rancor in Aspen than goes beyond the spirited debate that
always has characterized the town.
   Pitkin County Sheriff Bob Braudis agrees. ``Several issues have
driven a wedge between 30-year friends here. There's a
mean-spiritedness that's descended on this little valley here
that's new to us.''
   Judy Gerbaz, who manages the Thrift Shop, says she's weary of
the infighting: ``Even the school board meetings in this town are
wild.''
   Still, she takes pride in Aspen's argumentative and progressive
spirit.
   ``Some say we're a laughingstock, but I think we're educating
the world.''

   Jerusalem's mayor Saturday blamed recent
statements by President Bush for raising tensions in the city,
which over the weekend experienced some of its worst violence in
the Palestinian uprising.
   Israeli police shot and killed two Palestinians in a refugee
camp of Arab east Jerusalem on Friday night, sparking riots
Saturday.
   Israeli leaders recently restated their claim to the Arab sector
of Jerusalem, despite recent U.S. statements that the status of the
land is in dispute and should be resolved by negotiation.
   Israel captured east Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan and
the Gaza Strip from Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. It has since
annexed east Jerusalem, home to 140,000 Palestinians, and has been
building Jewish neighborhoods around the Arab enclave to strengthen
its hold on the land.
   Both Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III said in the
past 10 days that Israel's policy of settling Jews in the occupied
lands, including east Jerusalem, was an impediment to peace.
   ``We do not believe there should be new settlements in the West
Bank or east Jerusalem,'' Bush said at a news conference March 3.
   Mayor Teddy Kollek of Jerusalem called Bush's remarks untimely
and unjustified.
   ``I feel offended by lack of knowledge about what is going on
here on part of very important people who are our friends who have
no idea what's happening,'' the mayor said on Israel radio.
   He said that on one hand Bush supported the unity of the city
and the right of Jews to live there, but on the other he referred
to Jewish neighborhoods in east Jerusalem as settlements. This, he
said, ``is inconsistent with the facts.''
   Kollek also said Palestinian frustration over the lack of
progress in peace efforts was mounting in advance of a debate
Sunday in the inner Cabinet. The left-leaning Labor Party and the
right-wing Likud bloc will once again attempt to reach a decision
on whether to accept U.S. proposals for holding peace talks in
Cairo.
   Violence erupted Friday night in the Shufat refugee camp in Arab
east Jerusalem, the only camp within Jerusalem's city limits.
Residents said police opened fire that night and again Saturday
morning to quell stone-throwing demonstrations.
   Camp residents and U.N. officials identified the victims as
Mahmud Fawzi Abu Khalife, 21, and Sufian Mohammed Abdullah Khalil,
25. They said at least two other Palestinians were wounded, one
critically.
   Police spokesman Uzi Sandori confirmed one dead and two wounded.
He said the man was killed when 40 masked youths charged police
with iron bars Saturday morning. About a dozen camp residents were
detained for questioning, he said.
   It was some of the worst violence in the city since the uprising
against Israeli rule began in December 1987.
   The deaths raised to 662 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli troops or civilians in the uprising. Forthy-three Israelis
also have been killed.
   Word of the deaths sparked rioting in east Jerusalem. Police
dispersed students who had overturned a vehicle and hurled stones
at passing cars, Sandori said.
   Later, about 400 Israeli and Palestinian women held a peaceful
rally along the border where east and west Jerusalem meet. They
called on Israel to negotiate with the Palestine Liberation
Organization and halt Jewish settlements in occupied lands.
   In the Gaza Strip, Arab reports said masked assailants killed a
Palestinian man, Ibrahim el-Batnaje, with axes and daggers for
allegedly collaborating with Israeli authorities.
   His death brought to 195 the number of Palestinians slain by
their fellow Arabs on suspicion of collaborating with Israel.

   The government acknowledged Saturday
that civilian casualties in last week's coup attempt were almost
four times higher than originally reported.
   Government spokesman Naqib Sameer said 70 more bodies of
civilians were pulled from the rubble of destroyed buildings,
bringing the death toll to 95. President Najib orignally said 25
civilians died during the fighting Tuesday and Wednesday.
   No figures were released Saturday for military casualties. A
Western military expert estimated hundreds of officers and elite
commandos died when Afghan warplanes bombed the capital, causing
extensive damage to the city of 2 million.
   The military also appeared have suffered heavy material losses.
At least 10 jet fighters and 15 tanks were believed destroyed,
government and diplomatic sources said. The government has said it
shot down three rebel planes.
   Meanwhile, Eastern European diplomatic sources and one Afghan
government official provided some insight into the failure of the
coup, which was launched Tuesday by Defense Minister Shah Nawaz
Tanai, a hard-line Communist.
   According to their statements, forces from the Afghan
intelligence agency surrounded two renegade tank corps late Monday
amid indications a coup might be attempted. This prevented critical
ground suport for Tanai when the assault began Tuesday.
   One corps was bottled up near Pulcharki prison on the outskirts
of Kabul and another tank unit was surrounded behind the Defense
Ministry. Only two tanks from the unit near Pulcharki broke free
Tuesday. They attacked the military university near the prison but
were soon destroyed, the Eastern European source said.
   The renegades were limited to air strikes on the capital.
Although the strikes were bloody and destructive, they were not
enough to unseat Najib.
   The trapped tanks, coupled with the army's use of destructive
Scud missiles against mutineers, appeared to have been central in
quelling the coup. A Western diplomat in Islamabad said the prompt
smashing of Tanai's communications network also hurt the defense
minister's plot.
   By Wednesday, most of the fighting was over, although rebels and
diplomats in Islamabad claimed fighting went on until Friday.
   On Saturday, Kabul was calm except for two rockets, apparently
fired by Moslem rebels who have been fighting the Soviet-backed
Kabul government for 12 years. Six people were injured, Sameer said.
   Government figrures released Saturday showed four bazaars, nine
restaurants, 230 shops, 18 buildings and 282 apartments were
destroyed during the coup attempt.
   ``Hundreds of residential houses and public facilities were also
damaged,'' Sameer said.
   A purge of forces loyal to Tanai continued Saturday. Government
sources reported arrests among officials in the state television
station and among lower-ranking officers in the military and the
security forces.
   Five members of the ruling Politburo, five members of the
National Defense Council and two members of the Central Committee
of the ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan have been
purged, Bakhtar News Agency reported.
   One Eastern European source, quoting Afghan government
officials, said more than 2,000 people were jailed Wednesday and
Thursday. The reports could not be independently confirmed.
   Of the arrests, Sameer would say only, ``We have arrested a
number of people involved in the coup plot and will continue to
arrest others.''
   The losses of men and equipment appeared likely to weaken the
fighting strength of the Afghan army, which remains locked in civil
war with the U.S.-backed rebels, the Western military expert said.
   The Afghan air force, which was the center of the coup attempt,
has been credited in large part with helping Najib survive since
the Kremlin ended nine years of military intervention in February
1989.
   But it also seemed unlikely guerrilla forces would be able to
capitalize on the chaos. They remained in relative disunity,
diplomats based in Kabul said.
   Afghan government radio and television continued to link Tanai's
plot to fundamentalist rebel leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, but
diplomats in Kabul said they believed the rebel leader had nothing
to do with the operation.
   Hekmatyar has said, however, he supports the coup and is
reportedly involved in negotiations with Tanai supporters. Tanai
fled to Pakistan on Wednesday and then allied himself with
Hekmatyar.

   Barraged by drug questions, death penalty
claims and million-dollar television advertising, Texas voters go
to the polls Tuesday to cast their primary election ballots for
governor.
   The Democratic primary _ pitting Treasurer Ann Richards,
Attorney General Jim Mattox and former Gov. Mark White _ is
especially bitter. Republican hopefuls are scrambling to hold
oilman Clayton Williams under the 50 percent mark he needs to avoid
an April runoff election.
   The races appeared headed toward an all-time state spending
record for a gubernatorial primary. Together, the top three
Democrats and top four Republicans spent $25 million through March
5.
   A Dallas Morning News-Houston Chronicle poll conducted last week
showed the Democrats in a dead heat and Williams widening his
already substantial lead over the Republican pack.
   The poll, to be published in the newspapers' Sunday editions,
showed 28 percent of those surveyed backed Ms. Richards, while
Mattox had 25 percent and White garnered 24 percent. But the poll's
margin of error of 4.5 percentage points meant it was too close to
call.
   The Democratic race was so contentious that Mattox, whose own
slogan was ``Texas Tough,'' decried what he called the
``cannibalism'' of his party's infighting.
   Ms. Richards, a rising Democratic star after her keynote speech
at the party's 1988 national convention, found herself under siege
from opponents and the news media after repeatedly refusing to say
whether she ever used illegal drugs.
   ``This question was never raised in the eight years that I was
managing a portfolio of $4 billion a day. It was only when I got in
the way of these two boys who want to be governor that it came
up,'' she said.
   A recovering alcoholic, Ms. Richards said she hadn't used a
``mood-altering chemical'' in 10 years, and she accused both White
and Mattox of profiteering from public service.
   ``They've got the best resumes money can buy,'' Ms. Richards
said, suggesting that besides a drug test, the candidates should
take lie-detector tests as well.
   Mattox called on her to ``stop running the down-in-the-gutter
type of campaign you're running.''
   White and Mattox sparred with each other over the death penalty.
   Mattox aired television commercials claiming he was responsible
for the executions of 32 felons.
   White, governor from 1983 to 1987, responded with an ad that
showed him walking past giant photos of criminals put to death
during his tenure, saying, ``Only a governor can make executions
happen. I did. And I will.''
   The Republicans dueled more politely, with pundits predicting
that the colorful and popular ``Claytie'' will coast to victory.
   ``The question is not, `Will Williams fall under 50 (percent),'
but `Will he get over 60?''' said Richard Murray, director of the
poll for the newspapers by the Public Policy Center at the
University of Houston.
   Williams' nearest rival, Railroad Commissioner Kent Hance,
nonetheless predicted a runoff. A former Democrat and congressman,
Hance said he would quit politics if he didn't win the GOP
nomination.
   Williams, a Midland businessman so popular that his campaign
appearances drew autograph seekers, said he hoped to avoid a runoff
so he could turn his guns on the Democrats.
   ``As a Republican, it would be much better for our party if I
were able to make it without a runoff,'' he said.
   He has spent $8 million on the campaign _ $6 million out of his
own pocket _a record for one candidate in a Texas gubernatorial
primary.
   The Williams campaign dominated the television airwaves with
lavishly produced commercials. His final ad showed him wearing a
cowboy hat and standing in front of a chuck wagon, talking about
the spirit of Texas.
   ``I'm a fourth-generation Texan and I'm very proud of it,'' he
tells the camera. ``We sure as heck haven't lost that spirit.''
   Besides Hance, two other GOP hopefuls aimed at a runoff.
   Dallas lawyer Tom Luce, an associate of billionaire H. Ross
Perot, won endorsements from most of the state's largest newspapers
for offering detailed programs on such issues as education and the
environment.
   But confronted with Williams' slick TV performances, Luce said
perhaps he could have used a ``charisma transplant'' to compete.
   Former Secretary of State Jack Rains was counting on a big vote
in his hometown of Houston to carry him after winning praise as a
skillful orator in three debates televised statewide.
   While the governor's race monopolized the public's attention,
Tuesday's primary ballots also will include dozens of other races _
from the U.S. Senate to the state Legislature.
   In the Senate race, Republican Phil Gramm is uncontested. On the
Democratic side, state Sen. Hugh Parmer of Fort Worth faces a
Lyndon LaRouche supporter, Harley Schlanger of Houston.
   Secretary of State George Bayoud and the two party chairmen have
predicted that about 25 percent of the state's 8.3 million
registered voters will cast ballots.
   GOP turnout is forecast at 750,000 to 1 million, while
Democratic turnout is estimated at 1.4 million to 1.6 million.

<TEXT>
   The government acknowledged Saturday
that civilian casualties in last week's coup attempt were almost
four times higher than originally reported.
   Government spokesman Naqib Sameer said 70 more bodies of
civilians were pulled from the rubble of destroyed buildings,
bringing the death toll to 95. President Najib orignally said 25
civilians died during the fighting Tuesday and Wednesday.
   No figures were released Saturday for military casualties. A
Western military expert estimated hundreds of officers and elite
commandos died when Afghan warplanes bombed the capital, causing
extensive damage to the city of 2 million.
   The military also appeared have suffered heavy material losses.
At least 10 jet fighters and 15 tanks were believed destroyed,
government and diplomatic sources said. The government has said it
shot down three rebel planes.
   Meanwhile, Eastern European diplomatic sources and one Afghan
government official provided some insight into the failure of the
coup, which was launched Tuesday by Defense Minister Shah Nawaz
Tanai, a hard-line Communist.
   According to their statements, forces from the Afghan
intelligence agency surrounded two renegade tank corps late Monday
amid indications a coup might be attempted. This prevented critical
ground suport for Tanai when the assault began Tuesday.
   One corps was bottled up near Pulcharki prison on the outskirts
of Kabul and another tank unit was surrounded behind the Defense
Ministry. Only two tanks from the unit near Pulcharki broke free
Tuesday. They attacked the military university near the prison but
were soon destroyed, the Eastern European source said.
   The renegades were limited to air strikes on the capital.
Although the strikes were bloody and destructive, they were not
enough to unseat Najib.
   The trapped tanks, coupled with the army's use of destructive
Scud missiles against mutineers, appeared to have been central in
quelling the coup. A Western diplomat in Islamabad said the prompt
smashing of Tanai's communications network also hurt the defense
minister's plot.
   By Wednesday, most of the fighting was over, although rebels and
diplomats in Islamabad claimed fighting went on until Friday.
   On Saturday, Kabul was calm except for two rockets, apparently
fired by Moslem rebels who have been fighting the Soviet-backed
Kabul government for 12 years. Six people were injured, Sameer said.
   Government figrures released Saturday showed four bazaars, nine
restaurants, 230 shops, 18 buildings and 282 apartments were
destroyed during the coup attempt.
   ``Hundreds of residential houses and public facilities were also
damaged,'' Sameer said.
   A purge of forces loyal to Tanai continued Saturday. Government
sources reported arrests among officials in the state television
station and among lower-ranking officers in the military and the
security forces.
   Five members of the ruling Politburo, five members of the
National Defense Council and two members of the Central Committee
of the ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan have been
purged, Bakhtar News Agency reported.
   One Eastern European source, quoting Afghan government
officials, said more than 2,000 people were jailed Wednesday and
Thursday. The reports could not be independently confirmed.
   Of the arrests, Sameer would say only, ``We have arrested a
number of people involved in the coup plot and will continue to
arrest others.''
   The losses of men and equipment appeared likely to weaken the
fighting strength of the Afghan army, which remains locked in civil
war with the U.S.-backed rebels, the Western military expert said.
   The Afghan air force, which was the center of the coup attempt,
has been credited in large part with helping Najib survive since
the Kremlin ended nine years of military intervention in February
1989.
   But it also seemed unlikely guerrilla forces would be able to
capitalize on the chaos. They remained in relative disunity,
diplomats based in Kabul said.
   Afghan government radio and television continued to link Tanai's
plot to fundamentalist rebel leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, but
diplomats in Kabul said they believed the rebel leader had nothing
to do with the operation.
   Hekmatyar has said, however, he supports the coup and is
reportedly involved in negotiations with Tanai supporters. Tanai
fled to Pakistan on Wednesday and then allied himself with
Hekmatyar.

   A state lawmaker flying south for a
Florida vacation this month will hold ``office hours'' in two
cocktail lounges there for constituents who are spending the winter
in that state.
   ``Just because these folks spend the winter away from the North
Country does not mean that they do not need to be represented,''
said Rep. Jeff Woodburn, a 24-year-old Democrat from Whitefield in
northern New Hampshire.
   A news release Friday said the first-term lawmaker will hold a
series of informal ``office hours'' March 26th at 2 p.m. at Perry's
Ocean Edge Lounge in Daytona Beach and March 31 at 4 p.m. in the
Elbow Room in Fort Lauderdale.
   ``It was sort of a nice Friday afternoon joke,'' Woodburn said
Saturday. ``I don't expect anybody will show up, but ... you never
know.''
   Woodburn, who was planning to vacation in Florida that week,
said he often holds office hours in local bars or restaurants in
his district, and at least 300 of his 6,000 or 7,000 constituents
spend the winter in Florida.
   Woodburn said he would not collect mileage or expenses from the
state for his trip.

   Louie the Llama doesn't have to be a
follower any more. The 5-month-old, 72-pound South American
ruminant had cataracts removed from his right eye in an operation
that lets him to see for the first time.
   Dr. James Clinton, the Medford veterinarian who performed the
50-minute surgery Thursday, said Louie's history suggests the llama
could not see because he never started any activities with fellow
animals.
   ``This one always followed,'' Clinton said. ``It never led.''
   Louie is recovering at Popcorn Park Zoo, home to about 300
injured or abandoned animals ranging from chickens to deer, said
zoo director John Bergmann.
   With cataracts, the crystalline lens of the eye becomes opaque,
blocking light rays instead of refracting them. The surgeon removes
the lens, leaving the cornea, the transparent tissue over the front
of the eyeball.
   Clinton compared the crystalline lens to a fine-tuning
instrument. He said its removal results in about 90 percent vision.
   Clinton, an eye specialist whose prior patients have included
owls and a leopard, said Louie was his first llama.
   Clinton operated on just one eye because the surgery prompts a
release of a protein that causes inflammation. Most animals can see
well enough with one eye but Louie could get surgery in his left
eye after 16 weeks, Clinton said.
   Bergmann is checking on how Louie is faring with eyesight for
the first time. ``Last night, it moved away from us for the first
time when we brought it food,'' Bergmann said Friday.

   The U.S. District Court that serves
Georgia's Southern District has become the first in the nation to
get its own flag.
   The red, white and blue flag, designed by Clerk Henry R. Crumley
Jr. and given official recognition in a Dec. 8 court order by Chief
Judge Anthony A. Alaimo, will be displayed in each federal
courtroom in the 43-county district.
   David Sellers, spokesman for the Washington administrative
office of all U.S. courts, said Friday that he knows of no other
court district in the nation that has its own flag.
   Crumley said he and Alaimo felt the judiciary, as the third
branch of government, should have its own flag. Most federal
agencies already have flags.
   His court flag has a white stripe through the middle, separating
its red top and blue bottom. In the center is the Great Seal of the
United States.
   Curved above the seal are the words, ``United States Courts,''
and below are the words ``Southern District of Georgia.''
   Crumley said the red symbolizes the blood that has been shed to
preserve the judicial system, the white, the purity of the system
and the blue, the commitment of the courts to upholding the law.
   ``People who have seen it think it's beautiful,'' said Crumley.

<HEAD>Accused Northwest Crew Loses Licenses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials have revoked the licenses
of three Northwest Airlines flight crew members accused of flying
under the influence of alcohol.
   ``Safety and alcohol do not mix,'' said Federal Aviation
Administration Administrator James B. Busey, in a swift action that
he said Friday should serve as a lesson to other crews.
   Capt. Norman Prouse, 51, of Conyers, Ga., first officer Robert
J. Kirchner, 35, of Highland Ranch, Colo., and second officer
Joseph W. Balzer, 34, of Antioch, Tenn., were arrested Thursday
when Northwest Flight 650, a Boeing 727 with 91 passengers aboard,
arrived without incident in Minneapolis from Fargo, N.D., airport
police said.
   FAA officials had received an anonymous call indicating that the
three had been drinking in the Fargo area Wednesday night, said
Alan Muncaster, a Northwest spokesman.
   Minnesota law prohibits flying with a blood-alcohol level above
0.04 percent. The case will be referred to the city attorney's
office by Tuesday, said Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport
police chief Jim Welna.
   Busey said the crew had violated the Minnesota law and federal
rules against flying within eight hours of drinking alcohol.
   ``We will take equally forceful action against any other airman
who violates the agency's regulations against alcohol,'' Busey said.
   Violation of the agency's alcohol rules ``is not common at
all,'' said FAA spokesman Bob Buckhorn.
   Buckhorn said Busey acted after the three crew members were
reported by an FAA inspector to have been flying within eight hours
of drinking, being under the influence of alcohol and having
blood-alcohol concentrations greater than 0.04 percent.
   The three crew members have the right to appeal their emergency
license revocations within 10 days to the National Transportation
Safety Board.
   Kirchner and Balzer have not returned phone calls and Prouse has
an unlisted number.
   The Air Line Pilots Association issued a statement expressing
its support for a ``100 percent alcohol- and drug-free cockpit on
every flight'' and called any deviation from that standard as an
``extremely rare anomaly.''
   Bob Gibbons, another spokesman for Eagan-based Northwest, said
that the airline was conducting its own investigation to see
whether the crew had violated the company's rule against drinking
within 12 hours before a flight.
   The three men were removed from flight duty, he said. ``Upon the
completion of our investigation they could be subjected to
discipline which could be as severe as discharge from the
company,'' he said.
   Northwest spokesmen were silent on specifics of the case pending
the outcome of the investigation, but promised to make public the
outcome and suggested that the matter may be settled next week.
   FAA records show that since 1984, the industry has recorded 237
incidents of drug and alcohol abuse by crew members, including 126
in which licenses were revoked. The rest were suspensions of 30
days to a year. At least six involved major carriers, but none
appeared to involve Northwest.
   Friday also marked the last day for comments to the U.S.
Transportation Department as it debates whether to formally
introduce a new rule allowing random testing of essential
transportation-system workers for alcohol abuse.
   Drug testing in the airline industry, including pilots and
mechanics at Northwest, began Jan. 1.

   At least 10 people were killed
overnight in clashes related to black factional fighting, police
said Saturday. Authorities arrested about 140 people for protesting
or looting as the government clamped down on unrest.
   Nine people were killed in black factional fighting in various
areas and a police officer was killed by gunmen, a police report
said. The worst unrest was in the black township of Kathlehong
outside Johannesburg, where three new deaths brought the toll in a
week of factional violence to at least 22. Scores of people have
been injured.
   South Africa has been hit by a wave of violent unrest that has
claimed about 200 lives during the past month. The unrest is
regarded as the worst to hit the country since the mid-1980s. The
government threatened to use emergency measures to end it.
   Police arrested about 80 people in Cape Town on Saturday for
taking part in a protest to demand the release of political
prisoners. Police declared the march illegal and moved in after
about 300 protesters attempted to march with signs saying:
``Release Political Prisoners.''
   Authorities in Bophuthatswana, a black homeland north of
Johannesburg, said they arrested about 60 people Saturday for
looting and taking part in protests Feb. 5 and 6.
   South African police also reported a number of minor clashes
with protesters in various areas. Officers fired shotguns, tear gas
and rubber bullets, but no serious injuries were reported.
   The Star newspaper reported Saturday that the government is
considering further measures to halt the unrest, and more arrests
are expected. The violence has stemmed from various causes,
including black factional fighting and unrest in the tribal
homelands.
   In Kathlehong, a fight between rival taxi companies in the
township exploded into a major factional fight last week. Hundreds
of residents have fled the area. The South African Police sent
extra units into the area to protect residents, police said.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok told Parliament Friday the
government was prepared to use its extensive powers under the
3{-year-old state of emergency to quell the violence.
   The emergency regulations allow police to detain suspects for up
to six months without charge, ban protests, and bar journalists and
the general public from protests and areas of unrest.
   The pro-apartheid Conservative Party charged the government is
responsible for the violence. Opposition leaders said President
F.W. de Klerk's decision to legalize the African National Congress
and other opposition groups encouraged radicals to attempt to seize
power.
   Walter Sisulu, an ANC leader, said Friday the government was
reverting ``to the old approach of looking for scapegoats and
hidden `instigators.'''
   ``The primary reason for the unrest, conflict and confrontation
has always been the poverty and violence caused by apartheid,'' he
said.
   Under apartheid, the black majority has no voice in national
affairs.

<HEAD>Nuclear Weapon Detonated in Nevada Underground Test</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The first U.S. nuclear weapon test of 1990
rocked the Nevada desert Saturday, the same day a published report
said the Soviet Union is phasing out testing on its mainland
because of citizens' safety concerns.
   The Washington Post reported that the Soviet Union would move
its nuclear testing site from south-central Asia to an island
inside the Arctic Circle. It cited sources it did not name in the
Soviet Union and the United States.
   The tested weapon, code-named Metropolis, was detonated at the
bottom of a 1,500-foot shaft at Yucca Flat at the remote Nevada
Test Site. The device was listed as having an explosive force of
20,000 to 150,000 tons of TNT, but was believed to be near the
upper limits because of warnings issued in advance by the Energy
Department.
   The test registered 5.1 on the Richter scale at the National
Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., according to
spokesman John Minsch.
   Seismic equipment atop Fitzgerald's Hotel and Casino in downtown
Las Vegas, 85 miles away, registered slight motion from the blast.
   ``There's definitely ground motion,'' DOE spokesman Chris West
said by telephone from a control point 12 miles from ground zero,
where the test was monitored by video camera.
   ``It's a little like sitting in a rowboat in the water; there's
a mild rocking motion,'' West said.
   He said 11 anti-nuclear weapons protesters turned out at a gate
about 30 miles from ground zero shortly before the 8 a.m.
detonation. Two protesters were arrested on trespassing charges.
   The Washington Post said the Soviets had decided to phase out
nuclear testing at their main testing grounds at Seimipalatinsk, in
south-central Asia, and halt testing there by 1993. The Soviets
plan to shift their testing program to Novaya Zemlya, a large
island in the Barents Sea within the Arctic Circle, the sources
told the paper.
   A Russian anti-nuclear group named Nevada has been campaigning
to halt testing at Semipalatinsk, complaining of radiation leaks
from the underground tests.
   ``The Soviets have had a second major test site for many years,
and have done a lot of testing there,'' West said Saturday. ``The
Soviets are not stopping testing but are just moving to another
location. The U.S. doesn't have the luxury of a backup site.''
   Metropolis was the 700th announced test conducted in Nevada
since testing began at the desert site in 1951. The last test was
Dec. 20.

   Jackson Martindell, a management
consultant and former publisher of Who's Who in America, has died
of cancer. He was 89.
   Martindell, who died Wednesday, was born in Amarillo, Texas, and
was a graduate of the University of Colorado and Columbia
University. He served in the Army's American Expeditionary Force
during World War I.
   By 1932, Martindell was in New York City and had founded
Fiduciary Counsel Inc., which advised prominent business families.
He also was treasurer of the Marshall Field Foundation.
   Over the next two decades, Martindell made a reputation as a
banker, financier, consultant and economic adviser.
   After World War II, he worked as a U.S. government volunteer to
help the Yugoslavian government re-establish that nation's economy.
   In 1948 he married Anne Clark, who later became a New Jersey
state senator and U.S. ambassador to New Zealand.
   In 1949, Martindell founded the New American Institute of
Management, which developed the ``management audit'' technique to
assess business leadership. For many years, he ran the company from
his Fort Lauderdale home.
   In 1956, he became publisher of Marquis' Who's Who of Chicago,
which published the annual Who's Who in America. He sold the
publication to ITT in 1969 for a sum he described as ``fantastic''
and retired.
   He is survived by three sons and a daughter.

in disputed election.
   April 1, 1964 _ Duvalier proclaims himself president for life.
   April 21, 1971 _ Duvalier dies and 19-year-old Jean-Claude
``Baby Doc'' Duvalier becomes president.
   Feb. 7, 1986 _ Duvalier flees to exile in France after a month
of anti-government unrest that leaves more than 50 people dead. A
three-man junta led by Duvalier's army chief of staff, Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy, takes power.
   Oct. 19, 1986 _ Low participation in first national election in
30 years for a 41-member Constituent Assembly to write a new
constitution.
   March 29, 1987 _ Voters overwhelmingly approve a new
constitution putting elections for president and National Assembly
in the hands of a civilian election commission.
   June 1987 _ Namphy's junta tries to take over elections.
Haitians take to the streets and soldiers kill at least 30 armed
demonstrators. Anti-government unrest and diplomatic pressure force
junta to back down.
   Nov. 29, 1987 _ Election Day. Assassins protected by the army
kill at least 34 voters and confiscate ballots. The election is
called off three hours after it begins. Namphy and junta dissolve

   Lithuania's first freely elected
parliament in 50 years convened Saturday night to prepare for a
historic vote on independence from the Soviet Union.
   ``Tomorrow, the festival begins,'' said Longinas Vasiliauskas, a
spokesman for the pro-independence Sajudis movement, which won a
two-thirds majority of the deputies in the new parliament.
   The parliament, which votes Sunday on whether to secede, is the
country's first legislature not dominated by Communists.
   Its deputies represent a variety of political parties, with no
single party dominant. In municipal elections earlier this month,
Sajudis backed candidates based on their views on democracy and
independence, regardless of party.
   At the modern building housing the parliament, citizens and
legislators sang the Lithuanian anthem as the session opened
Saturday night. Outside, about 100 demonstrators waved the
red-yellow-and-green flags of independent Lithuania and joked about
the day when they would need passports to travel to Moscow.
   Inside, Lithuanian leaders stood in front of a huge banner
depicting the Soviet star and the Communist Party's famous
hammer-and-sickle emblem.
   Asked if the banner would be removed when Lithuania declares
independence, activist Eduardas Potashinskas replied, ``That's
easy. If only that were all that we had to change.''
   Lithuania was an independent country between the two world wars.
In 1940, Lithuania and the other Baltic states, Latvia and Estonia,
were forcibly annexed to the Soviet Union while under Red Army
occupation.
   The bold move to declare Lithuania independent could present
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev with his greatest crisis in five
years in power. Gorbachev and other Soviet officials have indicated
the Kremlin may grudgingly accept Lithuanian secession, but at a
steep price.
   Specifically, Gorbachev has suggested a bill of $34 billion in
compensation for factories and other infrastructures built during a
half-century of Soviet rule. Lithuanians replied that their bill to
the Soviet Union for decades of repression would be higher.
   The independence proposal is widely expected to pass Sunday, due
to the commanding majority of seats won by Sajudis candidates who
favor independence. Sajudis has already won 95 of 130 seats filled
so far, said spokesman Haroldas Subachius.
   The last 11 races were being decided in run-offs Saturday and
Sunday, but the new parliament chose to rush into session with a
minimal quorum so it can vote on independence before Gorbachev is
given broad new powers by the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies
on Monday.
   Gorbachev is seeking the authority to declare a state of
emergency on his own, which would include the power to suspend
republic parliaments and take over administration of a republic.
Progressives consider the proposed powers potentially dictatorial.
   Also high on the parliament's agenda is election of the
Ireland-sized republic's two top leaders: the premier and the
chairman of the Supreme Soviet legislature. The second slot is
sometimes called the presidency, and Sajudis wants its own man in
the job instead of the current Communist Party leader, Algirdas
Brazauskas.
   A Sajudis council decided that because Communists are a minority
in the new Lithuanian parliament, it would be unfitting to re-elect
Brazauskas, activist Subachius said.
   Brazauskas enjoys widespread personal popularity because he led
the Lithuanian Communists when they split from the Soviet party in
December and joined the drive for independence.
   Sajudis probably will back one of its three leading figures for
the post of president, activists said.
   Gorbachev's reforms have provoked strong pro-independence
sentiments in many of the country's 15 republics. On Friday, the
Georgian parliament passed a resolution condemning the republic's
annexation to the Soviet Union, mirroring moves already made in
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
   The parliament will be asked to reaffirm an act first passed on
Feb. 16, 1918 declaring the state independent. Lawmakers already
have declared illegal Lithuania's incorporation into the Soviet
Union in 1940 under a secret Nazi-Soviet pact.
   Lawmakers also will be asked to restore the 1938 constitution
that was swept away by Josef Stalin's Kremlin in favor of
Soviet-style law.
   In remarks reported by the official Tass news agency, Lithuanian
economist Bronislovas Zaikauskas said his homeland, poor in natural
resources, could exploit its location on the Soviet Union's western
fringe to become a ``trampoline'' for Western firms seeking entry
to the Soviet market.
   However, Brazauskas has indicated the Kremlin might demand to
retain control of the city of Klaipeda if Lithuania secedes.
Klaipeda is the republic's main port.

<HEAD>Troop Withdrawal Agreement Signed, Hungary Wants End of Mutual Aid
Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Soviet Union and Hungary signed an agreement
Saturday calling for all Red Army troops to be withdrawn from
Hungary by the middle of next year, and Budapest proposed an end to
the mutual assistance pact between the nations.
   The pact was the Soviet pretext for invading Hungary in 1956.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn hinted it is time for the
Soviets to apologize for that invasion.
   ``We must give a clear picture of the events of 1956 and the
Soviet interference,'' he said. In December, the Soviets apologized
for the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   ``This is a new page in Hungarian history,'' Horn told a news
conference after he and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
signed the troop withdrawal agreement.
   He credited Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's new foreign
policy for the agreement. It calls for all 49,700 Red Army soldiers
and 27,146 military vehicles to start heading home Monday and to be
out of Hungary entirely by June 30, 1991.
   The Soviets have already agreed to remove their 73,500 soldiers
from Czechoslovakia by the same date. That means Moscow is
committed to withdrawing 123,200 troops from countries on the East
bloc's front line within 14 months.
   Horn said it is time to drop the ``obsolete'' mutual assistance
pact, which the Soviets cited when their troops poured into Hungary
in 1956 to crush its drive for democratic reforms.
   On March 25, Hungary will hold its first free national elections
since the Communists consolidated power in 1948.
   ``The treaty of friendship and cooperation is obsolete,'' Horn
said. ``We must now replace it with a joint statement reflecting
changes in our bilateral relations and in the international
sphere.''
   ``We should get rid of the ideological elements still remaining
in our relationship,'' he said, a clear reference to the Soviet
Union's decades of forcing Communism on resisting Hungarians. The
foreign minister said the Soviets have agreed to discuss the issue.
   In an interview with Hungarian radio, Horn also said he could
see the possibility of NATO and the Warsaw Pact converging someday,
if the East bloc continues to democratize.
   Asked if he preferred a united Germany to be neutral or a member
of the Western alliance, Horn said bluntly: ``If the future Germany
wants to remain a member of NATO, we should respond to that wish.''
He also said the wishes of all of Europe should be taken into
account.
   Hungarian radio reported that the two governments are still
negotiating on the property being left behind by the Soviet troops.
   The Soviets were reported to have preferred a final pullout date
from Hungary of Aug. 31, 1991, giving them more time for
dismantling military stockpiles. Hungarian military officials say
the equipment includes 860 tanks and 1,500 armored personnel
carriers.
   According to Hungarian radio, two-thirds of the withdrawal of
Soviet troops and equipment is to be completed by the end of this
year.
   Horn said the Hungarian side first brought up the troop issue
two years ago and it was initialed Friday, in time for Horn's
planned arrival Saturday for the signing ceremony.

   An opposition leader was placed
under house arrest Saturday after demanding multiparty democracy
and expressing support for demonstrators protesting austerity
measures.
   Soldiers surrounded Laurent Gbagbo's house and prevented
reporters from entering.
   Gbagbo at first was allowed to make telephone calls. He said he
was ordered to remain at the house after he returned from the
French Embassy, where he was refused a visa to travel to France to
participate in a television debate on African economies.
   But several hours after police arrived at his home, telephone
callers received an announcement saying Gbago's number was no
longer in service.
   Gbagbo has been under house arrest twice in the ast two years.
He is a history professor who founded the unauthorized Ivorian
Popular Front eight years ago and has been calling for multiparty
elections.
   He also has said his party supports recent anti-government
protests. The protests turned violent and produced the worst unrest
in years in this normally peaceful country.
   Demonstrators, mainly university students, said the poor were
being burdened with an unfair load of austerity measures. They
demanded the ouster of President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, accusing
him of siphoning money from state coffers.
   Soldiers and police broke up protests with harsh beatings, tear
gas and stun grenades. Many protesters were peaceful, but others
stoned and burned cars and ransacked several stores. It is not
known how many people were injured in the violence.
   Troops still patrol Abidjan, the capital, though there have been
no demonstrations for a week.
   The government defused the unrest by promising to review planned
austerity measures. Those measures would cut salaries of civil
servants by up to 40 percent and charge a 10 percent austerity tax
for some people.
   Authorities also have promised to cut prices of staple foods and
rents on government housing.
   But World Bank and International Monetary Fund officials say
wage cuts are necessary if Ivory Coast is to control an economic
crisis rooted in slumping prices of cocoa and coffee, its main
exports.
   Gbagbo has blamed the crisis on the ruling Democratic Party and
Houphouet-Boigny, who has ruled the nation as a one-party state
since its independence from France in 1960.
   Several of Gbagbo's supporters have been detained recently for
distributing a newsletter calling for the peaceful creation of a
multiparty democracy. The newsletter cost the equivalent of $2, but
photocopies now are being sold for $7.

   Former leaders of a leftist guerrilla
group campaigned in mayoral and congressional races Saturday, just
hours after signing a treaty with the government that ended their
16-year insurgency.
   President Virgilio Barco initialed the agreement with Carlos
Pizarro, the commander of the April 19 Movement, or M19 rebel
group, in a historic ceremony late Friday at the government palace.
   On Thursday, the estimated 1,800 members of M19 laid down their
weapons in two towns in Colombia's southern mountains. The weapons,
including automatic rifles, pistols and shotguns, were melted down
to forge a monument to peace.
   The government agreed to create a fund to help develop rural
areas, incorporate former guerrillas into civilian life, and create
a commission to study the effects of cocaine trafficking on
Colombia and other countries.
   Barco told reporters after signing the agreement that it had
``bolstered the hope of finding civilized paths for resolving
conflicts and differences.'' But the president added that other
leftist guerrilla groups were ``persisting in their terrorist
actions against the Colombian people.''
   He reiterated his willingness to negotiate with the
organizations.
   Two other rebel groups, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia and the People's Liberation Army, have continued attacking
police and military targets.
   Another leftist guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army,
has said it will never enter peace talks. It has carried out a
campaign of kidnappings and other terrorism to disrupt Sunday's
balloting.
   Colombians in all regions will elect all 313 members of the
nation's bicameral legislature, 9,042 city councilmen, 1,009
mayors, and 421 state assembly members. The governing Liberal Party
also will nominate the candidate it will back in the May
presidential election.
   The government has said that only a few southern and
northeastern towns are threatened by the National Liberation Army
offensive and that elections will not be suspended in any of
country's 1,009 municipalities.
   Pizarro is running as the M19's candidate in Bogota's mayoral
race and many and his former comrades in arms are seeking
congressional seats.
   Political analysts give them little chance of winning, but
government sources say that Pizarro may act as an official mediator
between the government and other leftist guerrilla groups in any
future peace talks.

<TEXT>
   Major opposition parties Saturday
demanded a delay in May elections to allow more time to challenge
the post-revolutionary leadership, which has been attacked for its
ties to the old regime.
   The demand represents the first time the fractious opposition
has openly pooled its forces to stop the National Salvation Front's
bid for long-term power.
   The National Peasants' Party and the National Liberal Party, the
two largest opposition groups, joined forces with smaller parties
in seeking the election postponement in a letter to interim
President Ion Iliescu. They did not say when the letter would be
sent.
   However, the government has reacted with scorn to previous
demands for a delay in elections. ``They are idiots,'' government
spokesman Cristian Unteanu said recently.
   The vote is set for May 20, but the opposition wants more time
to build up electoral momentum against the dominant National
Salvation Front. Many of its members have been assailed for having
held posts in the government of Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu, who was toppled in a bloody revolution in December.
   A draft of the opposition's letter to Iliescu said Romanians are
not ready for democratic elections because they don't know the true
state of the nation's devastated economy.
   The country's rulers gained some economic maneuvering room
Saturday, though, as four strikes were reportedly settled. The
actions involved Bucharest subway workers, 15 Carpathian coal
mines, pilots and sailors in the Black Sea port of Constanta and
public transport workers in the Danube port city of Galati,
according to Bucharest Radio.
   The opposition also argued in its letter that May elections
would hurt the nation's agricultural sector by distracting workers
from the vital spring planting.
   However, the primary reason for seeking postponement clearly is
opposition fears that the National Salvation Front would have an
unassailable lead in elections as early as May. The Front has
dominated Romanian politics and government since the December
revolution.
   The 150-member Front took power during the revolt. It
relinquished only part of its power to a multiparty Council of
National Unity in February after the Front announced it would run
candidates in the elections, reversing an earlier pledge. The
reversal touched off an outcry from the opposition, because the
Front was also organizing the elections.
   The Front has since styled itself as a political movement rather
than a ruling body, but its members dominate both the government
and the Council, which is serving as a parliament until the
elections.
   In his earlier interview with The Associated Press, Unteanu
said: ``If they decide to postpone the elections, it will be a
signal for political instability.''
   ``The government needs to have the legitimacy of elections,'' he
said.
   The government is struggling to restructure the economy from the
centralized, state-run Communist model to a free-enterprise, market
economy.

   The re-enactment of the historic,
50-mile march from Selma to Montgomery ended Saturday with 3,000
people gathered in the shadow of Alabama's Capitol to rekindle the
spirit of the civil rights movement.
   The turnout paled in comparison to the 1965 march, when 25,000
people gathered in ``the Cradle of the Confederacy'' to demand
voting rights, but organizers hoped the 1990 trek would herald a
new age of activism.
   ``It would be a shameful waste if we marched all the way from
Selma to Montgomery to go home and sit on our seats of apathy,''
said Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christan Leadership
Conference, who led the week-long, commemorative march.
   At the Capitol, where the Confederate battle flag still flies
over the white dome despite blacks' protests, Jesse Jackson told
the chanting crowd their message must be taken to the nation's
capital.
   ``On to Washington for jobs,'' Jackson exhorted the gathering.
``On to Washington for peace dividends. Keep hope alive.''
   Coretta Scott King encouraged the mostly black crowd to keep
fighting for racial equality.
   ``These are the faithful few, and God always uses those who are
willing to be used,'' said the widow of slain civil rights leader
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., whose first church is a block down the
street from the Capitol steps.
   Mrs. King, Jackson and others said blacks had made progress but
much remained to be done. Lowery called for corporations ``to
engage in equitable reinvestment in our communities.''
   Jackson later went to meet with former Gov. George C. Wallace at
his home. Wallace, who opposed the 1965 march, later won widespread
black support that helped win his fourth and final term as governor
in 1982.
   ``If the governor can come from where he was 20 years ago and
speak of a moral society where there is economic justice, there is
hope for blacks and whites alike,'' Jackson told reporters after
the meeting.
   The rally capped a week in which about 150 marchers crossed the
Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma and headed east along a rural highway
to Montgomery, covering the same path activists took in 1965.
   The march 25 years ago came two weeks after ``Bloody Sunday,''
where white authorities routed black marchers with clubs and tear
gas as they tried to cross the bridge over the Alabama River.
   The violence at Selma was recorded by television cameras and
helped spur Congress to pass the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which
guaranteed ballot box rights for blacks.
   James P. Turner, an acting assistant attorney general in the
civil rights division of the Justice Department, said the law's
effect was almost immediate. In Alabama alone, he said, black voter
registration increased from about 92,000 in 1964 to nearly 250,000
in 1967.
   ``Nationwide, the number of black elected officials has leaped
from 103 in 1964 to 7,226 today,'' Turner told the rally.
   The final, two-mile leg of the commemoration began about two
hours before the Capitol ceremony, with Lowery and Mrs. King
leading about 1,000 blacks and a few whites through some of
Montgomery's black neighborhoods.
   Blue skies and warm temperatures greeted the sign-carrying
marchers, who chanted ``Fired up!'' and ``We ain't gonna take it no
more'' on their way downtown.
   Lowery said blacks must reclaim values of the civil rights era
that some have lost en route to 1990. ``We crossed the Edmund
Pettus Bridge but now we've got to cross the rivers of apathy and
loss of self-esteem,'' he said.

   Harlem residents fed up with billboards enticing
them to buy alcohol and cigarettes splashed paint over more than a
dozen of the signs Saturday and cheered a company that followed
suit.
   Singing ``Yield Not to Temptation,'' about 50 members of the
Abyssinian Baptist Church marched with buckets and paint rollers
down a street in Harlem, a section of New York where a recent study
found men have shorter lifespans than in Bangladesh.
   ``Alcohol kills more people than heroin, marijuana, crack and
cocaine together,'' said the Rev. Calvin O. Butts, the protest
organizer and church pastor. It was the group's second swing
through Harlem in two weeks.
   Butts said billboards advertising such products as whiskey and
cigarettes ``proliferate in the African-American community more
than any other community,'' often degrade women and are designed to
entice youths.
   ``The board says `Alive with pleasure,' but tell that to someone
dying of lung cancer,'' Butts said.
   The group passed graffiti-covered tenements and a dozen or so
men drinking out of brown paper bags at 10 a.m. The protesters
whitewashed more than a dozen 6-foot-by-12-foot billboards.
   Four police cars and a police van tailed the crowd, which
included several children.
   ``We are using discretion,'' said police Capt. Terry Tunnock.
``We haven't had complaints from anyone. If any of the companies do
complain there could be arrests, but none have come forward.''
   Butts and others painted over several billboards a week earlier,
prompting one outdoor advertising company, Scheiffelin &amp; Somerset
Co., to announce Johnny Walker Scotch and Hennessey Cognac would be
banned from its billboards in low-income communities.
   Protesters gathered at the church Saturday before hitting the
streets with their whitewash and rollers. They got a surprise
announcement from a visitor, John Brown, who is vice president of
another sign company, Metropolitan Outdoor Advertising.
   Brown announced that his company, one of the largest in the city
and one of the biggest distributors of small billboards in the
United States, would remove liquor and cigarette billboards within
five blocks of places of worship, schools and play areas in New
York. He said the company would consider doing the same elsewhere
in the country.
   Brown noted similar whitewashing campaigns under way in Chicago,
Detroit and Oakland, Calif.
   ``If we are to survive as advertisers in the '90s, we need to
take positive action,'' he said.
   The billboard-blotting campaigns come at a time of heightened
criticism of manufacturers that target advertising for cigarettes
and alcohol at minority consumers.
   In January, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. canceled plans to market a
new cigarette, Uptown, with ads tailored to win over blacks, after
Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan joined
Philadelphia community groups in criticizing the campaign.
   Officials in Richmond, Calif., are considering a ban on alcohol
and tobacco billboard advertising near schools.
   ``We have to get at the basic, underlying motivations of people
and we believe that these alcohol and cigarette billboards send a
mixed message to kids who are being taught in a school to shun
drugs,'' said Jim Rogers, chairman of an anti-drug task force in
Richmond.
   A Metropolitan Outdoor Advertising worker perched on a ladder
got cheers and applause from paint-slinging protesters as he
papered over a billboard advertising beer with a new message: ``God
makes house calls.''
   A few bystanders, some sipping from cans or bottles hidden
inside brown paper bags, seemed unimpressed with the effort.
   ``It ain't going to work,'' said an elderly man watching the
group. He nudged a young man standing next to him who held up his
brown paper bag and said, ``This is a personal thing.''
   The protesters worked at one point in a vacant lot littered with
garbage and ankle deep in spots with empty cans. Across the street,
21-year-old Larry Rodgers said he didn't think the billboard
campaign would change much.
   ``On every corner there's a liquor store and a bar,'' said
Rodgers, who described himself as a recovering alcoholic. ``It's a
good idea, but it's not going to help.''

   The subway train had just left
Philadelphia's big, bustling 30th Street Station when morning
commuters noticed something was wrong.
   ``It kind of hit a bump or something and then it rocked really
hard,'' said Rose McGurl, 35. ``And then it hit the posts that
separate the two lanes of trains and then it came off the tracks.''
   Three people were killed and 94 injured when the Southeastern
Pennsylvania Transportation Authority's six-car Train 61, filled
with hundreds of people heading to work, derailed at 8:21 a.m.
Wednesday.
   The last three cars abruptly were jerked onto adjacent tracks;
one car was ripped open by steel pillars in the 83-year-old tunnel.
   Then, after President Bush and Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner had unveiled a national transportation policy urging
further cuts in federal support for mass transit, investigators'
findings came in:
   _ One of four motors on the train's third car had lost its
primary and backup supports, come loose and gouged 1,555 feet of
ties before hitting a crossover switch, the National Transportation
Safety Board said.
   _ On Friday, the NTSB said 27 of 76 motors it inspected on 19
cars were improperly secured, including one other motor on the same
car on which the motor had dislodged.
   _ The motorman driving the train had tested positive for cocaine
use, but the NTSB said it hadn't been determined whether the drug
was a factor in the accident. The motorman, whose name was
withheld, will be suspended without pay Monday, SEPTA spokesman
Dave Murdock said.
   _ Still unexplained by SEPTA or city officials was a 17-minute
delay, in which a SEPTA dispatcher didn't issue an alarm for nine
minutes after the derailment and paramedics weren't summoned for
eight minutes more.
   The safety board recommended none of the Budd Co.-built cars be
used until inspected and repaired, and commuters had to take
shuttle buses the rest of the week for a 37-block stretch of the
12.8-mile subway and elevated line.
   SEPTA general manager Louis Gambaccini pledged to complete the
inspections by Monday, when full service was scheduled to resume.
   He insisted the rail system was safe. The accident was the first
fatal derailment since 1961 on the line, which typically carries
100,000 passengers twice a day and which SEPTA has operated since
1969.
   Operator error, equipment failure and vandalism have caused
several major accidents in the past decade on SEPTA's suburban
train and trolley systems, including one fatality and 246 injuries
in three accidents during a 22-month stretch from 1984 to 1986.
   NTSB members John K. Lauber and Susan M. Coughlin returned to
Washington on Saturday, but 10 employees were expected to stay in
Philadelphia through the middle of this week, said Russell Gober,
investigator in charge.
   Investigators were still interviewing survivors, looking at
track and signals and going over earlier findings, he said.
``Mostly we're just getting the information that we've already
developed in perspective,'' he said.
   The NTSB's report on the accident isn't expected for nine months
to a year.
   Gov. Robert P. Casey toured the crash site Thursday and was
questioned about SEPTA's complaints of inadequate financing by
local, state and federal governments.
   ``President Bush cut $27 million from SEPTA this year,'' Casey
said. ``I've never cut five cents from SEPTA. I've done nothing but
increase money for SEPTA.''
   Gambaccini agreed the state's recent increases have been crucial
to SEPTA's survival, but he said more was needed, especially in
light of the federal government's proposed end of mass transit
subsidies.
   Gambaccini later said SEPTA's financial problems sometimes force
maintenance workers to take ``shortcuts,'' but dismissed them as a
possible factor in the subway crash.
   When the cocaine results were revealed, Gambaccini said he hoped
the findings wouldn't taint other SEPTA workers, whom he
characterized as ``a workforce of dedicated and responsible human
beings.''
   Of nearly 1,000 SEPTA employees tested since the Transport
Workers Union agreed to random tests a year ago, 2.32 percent
tested positive for illegal drug use, Gambaccini said.
   ``In every case, immediate and appropriate action was taken,''
he said.

   The Rev. Billy Graham took his crusade to the
open Berlin Wall on Saturday and appealed to East Germans he sees
as spiritually adrift following the demise of Communist ideology.
   In a one-hour sermon at the wall, the U.S. evangelist warned of
materialism and the lure of ``hedonism and self-gratification'' at
``this time of rejoicing.'' He was referring to democratic changes
sweeping the Communist world.
   ``The people I've met in Germany are living in both hope and
fear,'' Graham told a rain-soaked rally of about 10,000 people on a
vast, grassy square in front of the imposing Reichstag, the
parliament of Germany prior to World War II.
   He noted that while many Germans hope for renewed national unity
and prosperity, worries about the future abound.
   ``Many people feel insecure. The old roots are shaking
everywhere,'' Graham said.
   Hartmut Stepp, a West German Evangelical Church leader from
Stuttgart, said Graham's ministry was sought since ``a spiritual,
ideological vacuum exists because of this social upheaval.''
   At least half of the crowd was East German, judging from a show
of hands sought by one speaker at the rally.
   Horst Arold, 50, said he had traveled 175 miles from Weimar,
East Germany, for an event that would have been inaccessible only
five months ago. East Germany's old Communist regime flung open the
Berlin Wall in November, under pressure from mass protests for
democratic reform.
   ``This is fantastic,'' Arold said. ``It's the first time in
years that we can take part in something like this.''
   Rally organizers set up a giant video screen and public address
loudspeakers on the Reichstag steps, where Graham spoke under a
portico inscription that reads ``To the German people.''
   However, turnout was only a fraction of what organizers had
expected.
   Graham spoke a week before East Germany's first free
parliamentary elections on March 18, but said he had no political
message.
   The East German Christian Democratic Union, which is backed by
its West German counterpart led by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, has
emphasized its religious roots in the campaign.
   Graham last held rallies in Berlin in 1960, the year before the
wall went up. He has conducted eight previous evangelical crusades
in Germany, the first in 1954 when much of the nation still lay in
ruins from World War II.
   Graham, who was ordained a minister in the Southern Baptists'
Church in 1939, has also preached in the Soviet Union and other
East European countries in recent years.

   Lawyers for a man sentenced to 16 years
imprisonment in the nation's worst drunken-driving accident have
filed notice they will appeal his conviction.
   Larry Mahoney, 36, was convicted Dec. 23 on 81 charges in the
May 14, 1988, crash that killed 24 teen-agers and three adults
traveling in a school bus.
   Mahoney's pickup truck, going the wrong way on Interstate 71
near Carrollton, slammed head on into the bus, which was quickly
engulfed in flames. The victims were on a church outing.
   Twelve others on the bus were seriously hurt.
   Mahoney was convicted on 27 counts of second-degree
manslaughter, 12 counts of first-degree assault, 27 counts of
first-degree wanton endangerment, 14 counts of second-degree wanton
endangerment and one count of driving under the influence.
   Mahoney was sentenced to 16 years in prison and must serve half
the sentence before being eligible for parole.
   Attorneys filed a notice of appeal Friday in Carroll Circuit
Court.

   Jim Lahr sat ramrod straight in his wheelchair,
tears welling in his eyes as his field commander in Vietnam added a
long-delayed Bronze Star Saturday to the rows of medals pinned to
his Marine uniform.
   ``The good guys finally won one,'' said Col. Donald Meyers, who
retired from the Corps less than two years ago. ``It doesn't happen
very often.''
   While on patrol in Vietnam on March 21, 1969, 16 days before the
end of his 13-month tour of duty, Lahr and several other Marines
descended the steep banks of a stream to fill canteens.
   It turned out they had stumbled on a huge North Vietnamese
supply cache, said Denver Lawson Freeman, who probably would have
died there if it weren't for Lahr. As they stooped in the
2-foot-deep water, they were suddenly ambushed with machine-gun
fire and rocket-propelled grenades.
   ``The whole hill basically just exploded,'' Freeman said.
   A grenade fell nearby, wounding Freeman and several others.
   ``Corporal Lahr, with complete disregard for his own safety ...
assisted several Marines to safety,'' the award citation says.
``Despite the heavy fire, he made several trips ... until he
himself was wounded and unable to continue.''
   Lahr said he took one round from a rifle. The bullet went into
his shoulder, grazed his lung, hit three ribs and finally lodged in
his spine, paralyzing him from the waist down.
   For 20 years, neither Freeman nor Lahr knew that the other had
survived.
   But through a contact he made at a Marine Corps reunion last
summer, Freeman learned that Lahr was living in Lincoln, Ill. He
set out to see that his friend received the honor he deserved.
   If he hadn't pulled me out of the river that day I wouldn't be
here today,'' Freeman said after the awards ceremony Saturday at
the Marine Reserve base in St. Louis. ``There's just no doubt in my
mind about that.''
   Freeman ``started the ball rolling,'' said Marine Sgt. Major
Wallace Poyner, writing letters and petitions to the awards section
of the Marine Corps.
   Lahr downplayed his heroism, saying he did it all on impulse and
didn't even know immediately that he was shot.
   ``It all happened so fast,'' he said as he fingered the citation
for heroism. ``I fell down in the water and grabbed a big rock. I
didn't know I was hit until I looked down and saw the blood running
away from me in the water.''
   He remembers nothing more until he awoke on a hospital ship some
days later.
   Freeman suffered a crushed bone in his right thigh in the battle
and was hospitalized for 10 months after the attack. He now sells
insurance in South Charleston, W.Va.
   Lahr is active in veterans' groups, said Nancy, his wife of 20
years.

<HEAD>Panamanian President Says Aid Delay Hurts Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democracy will fail in Panama unless promised
U.S. economic help arrives soon, President Guillermo Endara said
Saturday as he entered the 10th day of a hunger strike to press for
the aid.
   ``People cannot eat democracy,'' Endara told The Associated
Press in an interview in the nave of Metropolitan Cathedral, where
he is fasting in ``solidarity with the suffering of the people of
Panama.''
   Endara, whose electoral victory in May 1989 was annulled by
former dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega, was sworn in secretly on
Dec. 19 only hours before U.S. forces invaded Panama and ousted
Noriega.
   But Endara's government is faced with severe economic problems.
The United States has turned over only $160 million of $400 million
it withheld in back pay during the last two years of Noriega's
rule. Meanwhile, President Bush's promises of economic assistance
are being discussed in Congress.
   The invasion and ensuing looting destroyed most of Panama City's
business districts, costing nearly $700 million in losses and
thousands of jobs. Unemployment, estimated at 20 percent before the
invasion, is now more than 30 percent, the government says.
   ``It is painful to see that for ridiculous and foolish reasons
they are holding back money that belongs to Panama,'' Endara said.
   The 52-year-old president added that he understands bureaucracy.
``I am sure President Bush is doing the best he can. There are
legal requirements that have to do with the releasing of the funds,
but still I do not see why the people of Panama have to wait,'' he
said.
   One of hundreds of people who visit the cathedral daily to draw
Endara's attention to the president's problems was Raul Kennedy,
who belonged to a military unit dismissed by Noriega because of its
participation in a failed coup last October.
   Kennedy was called back to serve in the new police force and
said he has been working since January.
   ``But I have not gotten paid yet because my appointment is not
official yet,'' he said. ``They tell me everything is being delayed
or suspended for lack of money. I understand the country is in bad
shape, but I have a wife and two children to support.''
   Said Endara: ``In order to survive, democracy must show that it
is effective, that it can provide people food and justice. If it
does not do that, it fails.''
   ``I am still optimistic. I think our experiment will be
successful, but I see signs of concern. There could be popular
unrest, unless there are some quick solutions. The congressional
delay of approval endangers our democracy,'' he said.
   Endara, a portly man who normally weighs around 240 pounds, has
lost more than 10 pounds since he started his fast.
   He is under medical care and drinks only water. He sleeps on a
canvass cot cooled by a fan. There is a phone by his side and he
attends government meetings.
   Not everyone agrees with how Endara is conducting Panama's
affairs.
   The daily newspaper La Prensa ran a cartoon showing the
president and his fiance, 22-year-old Ana Diaz, holding hands in
the cathedral, ignoring the rise in crime and other social
upheavals.
   On Friday police arrested more than 700 suspects while searching
for drugs and guns.
   The rise in crime is alarming, and police officials blame some
of it on unemployment and the amount of weapons believed to be in
the hands paramilitary bands set up by Noriega.
   ``We used to have an average of four murders per month,'' said
Capt. Leslie Loaiza, director of the technical police. ``We now
have 30.''

<TEXT>
   It's starting to sprinkle on the election-year
parade that last March brought the nation's 27 million veterans
more access to the White House.
   Not that the marching and music will stop anytime soon.
   The Bush administration's 1991 budget proposal asks for a record
$31 billion for the Veterans Affairs Department, including an
unheard of $12.3 billion for health programs.
   The proposal is ``the best VA medical care budget request by a
president in more than a decade,'' says Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee.
   And VA Secretary Edward J. Derwinski has raised the hopes of the
3.1 million Vietnam War veterans by promising he will personally
settle the Agent Orange question this spring. Derwinski, more than
any VA official in the recent past, has opened his doors to that
group of veterans, says Paul S. Egan of the Vietnam Veterans of
America.
   But the same members of Congress who praised the budget have
already begun tinkering with it and refused to go along with a
review of the VA medical system that could mean closing hospitals
or clinics. Veterans groups demanded $1.1 billion more and are
attacking VA's effort to review the benefits system.
   Derwinski is the first VA secretary of the United States. Until
March 15, 1989, VA stood for the Veterans Administration _ just
another government agency, albeit a massive one. Now it is a
department, giving Derwinski full Cabinet status.
   VA helps educate, house, treat and bury the people who served
the country in war or peace. It operates the largest health-care
system in the free world and is the fifth-largest life insurance
provider in the country.
   Second in size only to the nation's veterans-producing machine,
the Pentagon, the VA employs about a quarter of a million people.
VA's 172 medical centers and its other facilities are choice cuts
of meat in the federal pork barrel.
   Since they make up well over a tenth of the U.S. population and
are all of voting age, veterans are a political force, especially
when politicians wrap themselves in the flag as they did in 1988.
   That is why it was easy for President Reagan to sign the
Department of Veterans Affairs Act in October of that year even
though, as an avowed enemy of big government, he had tried to strip
the Education and Energy departments of Cabinet status.
   ``Given the broad political support which already exists for the
VA and its programs, the gain from elevation to a Cabinet
department would be at the margin,'' the independent National
Academy of Public Administration told Congress in 1988.
   That assessment is also why Derwinski, a wily former congressman
from Chicago, knows that hard times lie ahead.
   Derwinski must decide what to do about the 9 million or so World
War II veterans who are getting older _ and many of them sicker and
poorer. Large numbers have moved South and West away from existing
facilities in the East and Midwest.
   He must also decide how much special attention to give to the
nearly half-million Vietnam-era veterans who have continuing
post-combat trauma or to countless others who say they have cancer
or other ailments caused by exposure to Agent Orange.
   He must deal with an overstrained bureaucracy that forces young
veterans to wait months for their claims to be handled or just
can't get through to VA on the telephone. He must deal with
chronically underpaid doctors and nurses.
   Finally, Derwinski must develop and maintain good working
relationships with Congress, where he served 12 terms before
joining the Reagan State Department, and with the veterans' lobby.
   Congress and the veterans groups ``tend to be better
second-guessers than blocking backs,'' Derwinski said recently in a
rare show of pique.
   ``They tend to be less cooperative about proposals to innovate
than they do critiquing our past performance,'' he said. ``That's
the headache part of the job.''
   When Derwinski made those remarks, the Disabled American
Veterans had just questioned ``the department's commitment to its
role as veterans' advocate.'' The group had discovered VA was
quietly studying ``benefit reforms.''
   That in-house study includes a look at the sacred cow known as
disability payments. VA says it is looking at ways to restore
fairness to the system, including equal death benefits for
survivors of privates or generals.
   Derwinski ran up against a brick wall in Congress last July when
he asked for legislation to create a study commission that would
examine the VA's network of hospitals and clinics. He said no such
review had been done for a quarter of a century.
   ``We got caught in the debate about military base closings, so
our timing wasn't good,'' said Derwinski, who decided this year to
appoint his own review commission. It will make its proposals to
Congress in two years.
   Derwinski has also eliminated 27 medical districts ``that
everyone told me were layers of bureaucracy.''
   Although Congress cheered the new budget request, the House
Veterans Affairs Committee wasted no time tacking another $729
million on to it. Veterans groups asked for $1.1 billion more.
   Derwinski's considerable reserve of goodwill could rise or drop
depending on what he does about Agent Orange this spring.
   ``The advice is so terribly conflicting,'' Derwinski said.
``There's no consensus out there.''
   He gave strong hints starting last May he would give veterans
the benefit of the doubt and award them compensation payments on
Agent Orange claims _ adding perhaps $36 million to the VA's cost
of doing business.
   Derwinski backed off from a chance to decide last November. But
this year he's promising action, depending on the outcome of a
Centers for Disease Control study on cancer in Vietnam veterans.

<HEAD>Radioactive Pellet Found in Cross-Country Shipment, NRC
Investigates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials spent Saturday laboriously trying to
track down truck drivers, warehouse workers and others who may have
been exposed to an intensely radioactive pellet buried within a
transcontinental cargo shipment.
   The radioactive pellet _ the size of a pencil eraser _ was
discovered Thursday lying loose in a shipment of what were supposed
to have been empty containers trucked to Massachusetts. The pellet,
called a source, is used for making X-ray-type pictures of welds,
structural steel and other industrial objects.
   Technicians at the shipment's last stop, Amersham Inc. of
Burlington, discovered the pellet when they detected radioactivity
coming from the shipment of containers used to carry sources. The
container that the source was found in lacked a shielding device
that would have prevented the radiation from leaking out.
   ``It's safe to say that this is extraordinarily rare,'' said
Karl Abraham, a Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman. ``There
should be concern but certainly not panic until we have a chance to
contact all the individuals who have had exposure.''
   Abraham said it would take several days to determine how many
people may have received radiation during the shipment's transit
from South Korea to Los Angeles, where it was stored for a month
before being trucked cross-country to Amersham, which manufactures
equipment used to test industrial structures.
   ``It appears to be an old source, a decayed source,'' Abraham
said of the pellet. New pellets radiate at a level of 60 to 75
curies; radiation from the one that was found was at levels from 3
to 7 curies, he said.
   Initial measurements taken 4 to 6 inches away form the pellet
found the level of radiation to be 150 rems per hour _ millions of
times higher than that people normally are exposed to from the
environment and X-rays. A rem is a measure of the estimated damage
done to living tissue by radiation.
   People generally receive about one-tenth of a rem, or 100
millirem, of radiation annually from natural sources; the average
American is exposed to an annual dose of 77 millirem from medical
X-rays.
   Abraham said investigators would better be able to determine the
radiation field after reconstructing the way in which the cargo was
stored.
   ``Then we have to determine the relation of that to where the
driver was sitting, where the people in the warehouse were and how
long these people were near the source,'' he said. ``It's going to
be a laborious process that will take many days.''
   The NRC has enlisted the help of state officials in
Massachusetts, California, Pennsylvania and Maryland in their
efforts to reconstruct the radioactive shipment's path. The Sate
Department has also contacted the South Korean government, he said.
   Abraham said it wasn't immediately clear how or at what point
the radioactive pellet slipped into the cargo, but ``the shipment
supposedly came in sealed up under bond like most things do when
they go from one continent to another.''

<TEXT>
   Federal officials proposing a $200,000 fine
against Northwest Airlines say improper maintenance was involved
when an engine fell off a Northwest plane over Florida in January.
   Northwest said Friday it would seek to have the fine reduced.
   A three-engine Boeing 727 en route from Miami to Minneapolis on
Jan. 4 landed safely in Tampa, Fla., after losing the right rear
engine, which fell onto ranch land north of Tampa. There were no
injuries.
   The National Transportation Safety Board said in January that
preliminary findings showed blue fluid that apparently leaked from
the plane's forward lavatory solidified into chunks of ice as the
plane cruised at 35,000 feet.
   The ``blue ice'' then flew into the engine, damaging it until it
broke loose and fell off, as the engines are designed to do to
prevent damage to the fuselage, the official said.
   Northwest has maintained that various problems with the lavatory
had been repaired several times in the weeks before the incident,
but the Federal Aviation Administration said late Friday that a
leaking valve reported to the airline on several occasions between
Dec. 23 and Jan. 4, wasn't repaired.
   ``As a result, during that period the aircraft was operated in
an unairworthy condition on 53 flights,'' the FAA said.
   Northwest spokesman Alan Muncaster said Friday he expects the
airline will negotiate with federal officials in an attempt to get
the fine reduced.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration on Saturday welcomed a
promise by Haiti's new leader to set the stage for national
elections by turning over power within 72 hours.
   A U.S. statement called on the country's armed forces to join
with political and business leaders in a spirit of reconciliation.
   Stressing the longtime U.S. call for human rights in Haiti, the
statement said, ``We obviously hope the latest developments
contribute to a realization of this objective.''
   The administration has had mixed feelings about the regime of
Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril in Haiti, finding it responsive to U.S.
human rights demands but unconvincing about its commitment to free
elections.
   There is no U.S. economic or military aid to Haiti except for a
small program to combat narcotics. A $10 million emergency food
program for what is one of the poorest and most densely populated
countries in the Western Hemisphere was not continued this year.
   However, $41.4 million for agricultural development and other
humanitarian assistance is being distributed through voluntary
agencies.
   Shortly after Avril yielded power to Maj. Gen. Herard Abraham
the State Department responded by saying it welcomed the intermim
leader's promise to give way to a panel led by the Supreme Court
president in order to arrange elections.
   This step by Arabahm ``is in conformity with the spirit of the
constitution,'' said Adam Shub, State Department spokesman.
   The department, in its human rights report last month, linked
the Haitian army to human rights abuses in rural areas and said
armed bands, some possibly traced to remnants of the feared Tonton
Macoute militia of the Duvalier years, had committed a number of
murders.
   And yet, the report said: ``Human rights abuses perpetrated or
directed by government leaders were the hallmark of previous
Haitian regimes. The Avril government avoided the egregious
violations _ massacres and politically motivated killings _
characteristic of its predecessors.''
   This slightly favorable report to Congress on Haiti's record in
1989 took a nosedive at the start of this year.
   In January, the Avril government imposed a state of siege,
suspending basic civil liberties. Prominent opposition politicians
were beaten and deported. The Bush administration registered its
outrage. Within 10 days, the ban and censorship of the press was
lifted, constitutional guarantees were revived.
   And on Feb. 7, political prisoners arrested since November were
released in an amnesty. But the State Department said the actions
were insufficient evidence of the Avril government's commitment to
human rights and free elections. Ambassador Alvin Adams was
recalled to Washington.
   It was amid this re-evaluation of U.S. relations with Haiti, and
a strategy designed to wrench a positive response from
Port-Au-Prince, that the latest crisis developed.
   Reports that Mrs. Avril had taken refuge in Washington were not
confirmed. The State Department on Saturday watched unfolding
developments in Port-Au-Prince without a word of comment.
   The Avril government is the fifth in Haiti since Jean-Claude
Duvalier fled for France in February 1986 aboard a U.S. Air Force
transport. His family's 29-year rule was replaced by a national
governing council.
   ``Baby Doc'' left Haiti with a strong shove from the Reagan
administration, though Duvalier left a taped message behind
suggesting he had made the decision himself ``so a bloodbath
(would) be avoided for my people.''
   ``We don't want to take too much credit,'' a U.S. official told
an Associated Press reporter at the time. ``But, yes, we did (force
him out). And he knows it. He knew that sooner or later we would
make sure that he did (leave). But we wanted it done in a way that
would bring about democracy and help prevent another Iran or
Nicaragua.''
   As it turned out, Haiti became neither democratic nor as
instable as Iran after the departure of the shah. Haitians gained
freedom of expression, of the press and of association that did not
exist under the Duvaliers. But arbitrary arrests continued.

<HEAD>Report: 6 Die of Complications Tied to Experimental AIDS Drug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six AIDS patients taking the experimental
drug DDI have died of pancreatitis, a toxic side effect attributed
to the drug, according to a published report.
   The Los Angeles Times reported Saturday that the deaths have
occurred in the five months since the federal government made DDI _
dideoxyinosine _ available on a limited basis.
   Five of the dead were among the 8,000 patients receiving DDI as
part of an expanded access program through the Food and Drug
Administration, according to the drug's manufacturer, Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. The sixth was one of 700 patients taking part in
government-sponsored trials of the drug, the Times said.
   In a news release Saturday, the FDA said officials were aware of
adverse reactions to the drug, including deaths, but didn't provide
further detail. The FDA said it asked Bristol-Myers to provide
detailed information as soon as possible so the agency could
determine if changes are needed ``to make the ongoing protocols as
safe as possible.''
   The FDA also asked the drug company to write doctors caring for
patients receiving DDI ``providing them and their patients with the
best available information about this situation and urging them to
monitor their patients closely for signs of pancreatitis.''
   Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of AIDS activities for the
National Institutes of Health, told the paper ``toxic side-effects,
some of which will be serious,'' were expected.
   Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas, a digestive
organ. Severe inflammation can lead to kidney failure, respiratory
failure and death.
   Kathryn R. Bloom, a spokeswoman for Bristol-Myers, told the
Times the it hadn't been proven the deaths were caused by DDI.
   Bloom said there have been 44 reports of pancreatitis, including
the six fatalities.
   ``We are taking this very seriously,'' Bloom told the newspaper.
In addition to the letter being prepared for doctors, the company
is studying the affects of dose levels and the length of therapy.
   The expanded access program is to make DDI available to patients
with advanced infections by HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, who
are unqualified to take part in formal research studies. This
includes patients who are medically unable to take AZT _ another
drug for AIDS treatment.
   When the expanded access to DDI was approved last year, eight
non-fatal cases of pancreatitis had already been reported among
about 100 AIDS patients who had received the drug, the Times said,
citing government statistics.
   Many of those patients, however, were receiving far higher does
of DDI than those approved for widespread experimental use by the
FDA.

   Italian Communists applauded and sang
Saturday after party leader Achille Occhetto, moved to tears by the
embrace of his chief opponents, made an impassioned call for unity
in creating a new party.
   Occhetto has emerged victorious at the party congress in his
effort to relaunch the Italian Communist Party, a move that
eventually is expected to lead to a new party name and the
elimination of the hammer-and-sickle symbol.
   Delegates representing the West's largest Communist Party began
voting at about 11:20 p.m. on the proposal. But the result was
assured and delegates passed resolutions during the evening to
regulate how they will plan for the new party.
   The party said the voting booths would be open for three hours
and the result would be announced later Sunday. The final vote had
been expected earlier but was backed up behind a series of
resolutions and speeches.
   ``We want to change many things, but we do not intend to leave
the historic path from which we came _ we want to widen it,'' said
Occhetto.
   ``Together we will construct our future, we will struggle
together for democracy, for Italy and for Europe and socialism.''
   Occhetto's proposal was spurred by the collapse of communism in
Eastern Europe and the party's steady decline in membership and
electoral strength in Italy.
   Occetto was interrupted by applause 24 times during the
hour-long speech. He urged unity and outlined how the new party
would seek to create a ``democratic alternative'' in Italy to
represent the workers, the poor, the weak and the disenfranchised.
   The party leader came to the congress with the support of almost
67 percent of the delegates. That was more than enough to ensure
the success of his bid to create a new party.
   However, his proposal risks splitting the party, which claims
1.4 million members.
   Old Guard Communists waged an impassioned battle against
revisions, which were expected to include the name change and
elimination of the party's revered symbols.
   But fears of a party split seemed to vanish when the party's old
lion, Pietro Ingrao, and former party secretary Alessandro Natta,
two of the leading opponents of change, embraced Occhetto at the
end of his speech.
   The 1,092 delegates gave Occhetto a standing ovation, applauding
and singing ``Bandiera Rosa'' (Red Flag), the party anthem.
Occhetto wiped tears from his eyes as he took his seat on the high
red multi-tiered platform. The sports arena was awash in red
banners and Communist symbols.
   The Communists nearly came to power in 1976 when they won 34
percent of the vote, but they dropped to about 27 percent in the
last parliamentary elections in 1987.
   The Italian party has long proclaimed itself independent of
Moscow. It has espoused Western parliamentary democracy, supported
Italy's membership in NATO and condemned the Soviet intervention in
Czechoslovakia in 1968 and Afghanistan in 1979.
   But while the party has portrayed itself as a critic of
international communism, Occhetto has argued it cannot ignore the
march of history and the collapse of Communist governments in
Eastern Europe.
   He has maintained that a revamped Italian party can move closer
to the mainstream of European socialism and perhaps unite Italy's
fractured political left to offer an alternative to the Christian
Democrats, who have dominated Italian politics more than four
decades.

   An Iraqi court sentenced a journalist with a
British newspaper to death on espionage charges Saturday and
ordered a British nurse jailed for 15 years for allegedly helping
him, the Foreign Office said.
   Under Iraqi law, no appeal is allowed.
   The journalist, Iranian-born Farzad Bazoft of London's weekly
Observer newspaper, was arrested in September while investigating
reports of an explosion at an Iraqi military complex. The nurse,
Daphne Parish, was accused of helping Bazoft by driving him to the
plant.
   Bazoft, 31, and Mrs. Parish, 52, were tried by a revolutionary
court on charges of committing hostile acts against Iraq. The
proceedings, which were not open to the public, began Thursday then
were adjourned after five hours. They resumed for 35 minutes
Saturday, the Foreign Office said.
   The defendents were assigned Iraqi lawyers, but a British
diplomat was allowed to attend the trial.
   There was no indication when the execution of Bazoft might be
carried out. The 31-year-old stateless Iranian has lived in Britain
since 1975 and travels on British documents.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was ``horrified by the severity
of the sentence'' against Bazoft, a Foreign Office spokesman said.
He said she will appeal to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein for
clemency on humanitarian grounds.
   Junior Foreign Office minister William Waldegrave said the
government was concentrating on ``the immediate next few hours,''
to get the death sentence lifted.
   He said the government was considering sending a top-level
emissary to Baghdad. ``We rule out nothing,'' he said.
   The sentences, if carried out, ``are bound to have a
far-reaching effect on relations between the two countries,''
Waldegrave added.
   Amnesty International appealed for clemency.
   The London-based human rights organization said in a statement
that it ``opposes the death penalty in all cases'' and supports the
``right not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading
treatment or punishment.''
   Iraq's ambassador to Britain, Dr. Azmi Al-Salihi, told
Independent Television News he passed Mrs. Thatcher's plea for
clemency to Baghdad.
   Asked whether Hussein would consider the request, he said: ``Let
us see. We have good relations with the British government. We want
all the aspects of our good relations continued.''
   Bazoft, an Iranian exile, has lived in Britain since 1975 and
travels on British documents. Mrs. Parish lives in Baghdad, where
she is a senior nursing administrator for the Irish-run Ibn
al-Bitar hospital.
   Her daughter, Michelle de Vries, who lives in London, said she
was ``extremely shocked and distressed'' by her mother's sentence.
   An Iraqi who was in contact with Bazoft in Baghdad was also
tried and received a 10-year sentence for communicating government
secrets to a foreigner, the Foreign Office said. The Iraqi was
identified only as Rahim.
   ``We utterly deplore these harsh and excessive sentences,'' a
Foreign Office statement said. ``No evidence was produced at the
trial which would justify sentences of this severity. They come ill
from a regime which is trying to show a more liberal face to the
world.''
   In a front-page editorial on Sunday, The Observer called the
Iraqi court's action ``a monstrous piece of injustice that will
damage the country's reputation around the world.''
   ``It is an outrage demanding the same firmness which the prime
minister showed when she broke diplomatic relations with the
regimes of Libya and Syria for their official association with
terrorism.
   ``Terrorism is not the issue here, but cruelty barbarity and
injustice, which can be demonstrated many times over in Iraq.''
   In November, Bazoft appeared on Iraqi state television and said
he had been spying for Israel. Mrs. Parish did not appear in the
broadcast.
   The editor of the Sunday Observer, Donald Trelford, said the
paper was certain Bazoft was not spying for anyone. He said the
statement must have been made under duress and noted that Bazoft
appeared to be in poor physical shape.
   Trelford said Bazoft had sought official permission to visit the
Al-Iskandaria military complex south of Baghdad, had told the paper
of his movements, and had talked openly about the visit to
colleagues on his return to Baghdad.
   ``None of this conduct is consistent with espionage. It is
entirely consistent with journalism,'' he said.
   As Bazoft is an Iranian, the Foreign Office said it was not in
the same position to argue on his behalf as it was for Mrs. Parish,
who is British-born. But it said it was appealing on Bazoft's
behalf for humanitarian reasons and because he lived in Britain for
years.
   The explosion at the military complex was reported in London to
have killed up to 700 people, but the Iraqis later said 19 people
were killed in a fuel depot blast.

<HEAD>Iranian Paper Says Washington Plans Hostage Rescue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iranian newspaper said Saturday the
United States and Israel are planning a military rescue mission to
free Western hostages in Lebanon.
   The newspaper, the English-language Kayhan International, said
the eight captive Americans would be killed if such an attempt were
made to free them and the 10 other Westerners.
   The paper did not cite sources, and its unconfirmed report gave
no further details. There was no immediate comment from Washington.
   The newspaper, quoted by Iran's official Islamic Republic News
Agency, said any joint U.S.-Israeli rescue mission would ``end the
so-called hostage crisis with the death of at least the American
hostages.''
   Meanwhile, a key Moslem leader in Beirut, Lebanon, Mohammed
Hussein Fadlallah, said of the hostages: ``We believe there are
encouraging elements regarding readiness to deal with this issue.''
   He is spiritual leader of Hezbollah, or Party of God, an
Iranian-linked group believed to be an umbrella for organizations
holding most of the Western hostages.
   On Feb. 23, after returning from a trip to Iran, Fadlallah
called in a sermon for ``realistic and humanitarian means to free
the hostages.''
   There have been several Iranian reports since then that some
hostages might be freed. President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran
recently said the hostages were being used by the West as a
propaganda weapon and should be freed.
   There have also been reports that U.S. officials were talking
indirectly to Iranian officials in an effort to win the release of
captives.
   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Kayhan International said Saturday a recent ``media blitz'' on
the U.S. hostages in Lebanon was designed in part to prepare the
American public for the planned military operation.
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization said last week it had
``acquired accurate information that an American military operation
is imminent against areas where the Americans believe hostages are
held.''
   The pro-Iranian group, which holds two U.S. hostages, said in a
statement it had ``no intention'' of freeing hostages it was
holding.
   Kayhan International's positions are often at variance with
those of Rafsanjani, who favors good ties with the West to attract
investment and technology for Iran's sluggish economy.
   Former President Carter authorized an attempt to rescue 52
American hostages held in Iran in 1980. However, the operation
ended in disaster on April 25 of that year when a helicopter
collided with a tanker aircraft over an Iranian desert, killing
eight servicemen. The hostages were finally freed in January 1981
after 444 days in
   captivity.

   Rain and snow fell in the Pacific Northwest Saturday, and fog
slowed air traffic in Milwaukee and Chicago.
   Showers also fell across the South.
   Snow advisories were posted over the Cascade range in Washington
and northern Oregon, where heavy snow fell late in the week.
   Snowfall overnight Friday amounted to 3 inches at Timberline,
Ore., and the day before, eight inches fell at Stampede Pass,
Wash., bringing the season's total to 8{ feet.
   Wisconsin was almost completely blanketed with fog, and air
traffic at Mitchell Field International Airport in Milwaukee was
disrupted for much of the day.
   With visibility at 600 feet, all incoming flights and many
departures were halted from 8 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., said Ron LaMarche,
supervisor for the Federal Aviation Administration at the Mitchell
Field tower.
   At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, fog caused delays of
up to 90 minutes, and air traffic was running an hour late at the
city's other airport, Midway.
   For an hour in the morning, United Airlines, O'Hare's largest
tenant, ordered a ``ground stop,'' which directed controllers at
airports in cities to halt United flights to Chicago, said to
Chicago Aviation Department spokeswoman Lisa Howard.
   The dense fog, caused by a warm weather front moving through the
region, stretched from Chicago to Dubuque, Iowa, according to the
National Weather Service.
   It was rainy Saturday in much of the South and parts of the
Midwest.
   Showers fell from Virginia and the Carolinas across to northern
Georgia. Rain also fell in eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania and
New York state and southeast Minnesota.
   The low temperature for the nation Saturday was 4 degrees
Saranac Lake, in New York's Adirondack Mountains.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 33
degrees in both Duluth, Minn., and Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., to 86
degrees at Harlingen, Texas.

   A proposal to declare Ann Arbor a ``zone
for reproductive freedom'' by limiting punishment for abortions to
a $5 fine has generated little visible opposition from residents.
   The fines, similar to parking tickets, would go into effect only
if the U.S. Supreme Court reversed its 1973 decision permitting
abortions and Michigan decided to restrict abortions.
   ``There seems to be more discussion nationally than in Ann Arbor
about this,'' City Attorney R. Bruce Laidlaw said this week.
   Ann Arbor resident Sabra Briere said she led the effort to get
the referendum on the April 2 city ballot because abortion bans
don't stop women from having abortions.
   ``In the event the Dark Ages return, Ann Arbor will have a core
group of committed pro-choice people anyway,'' Briere said.
   Briere predicted the measure would pass easily in Ann Arbor, a
city of about 112,000 that is home to the University of Michigan.
   The effect of the proposed revision in the city charter would be
limited, because Ann Arbor can't prevent state police from
enforcing state laws, Laidlaw said. The measure wouldn't protect
doctors from losing their licenses or facing other penalties for
performing illegal abortions, he said.
   Briere said anti-abortion laws don't work. She said they didn't
stop her grandmother from having two abortions in the early 1900s.
   ``I think abortions will be performed all over, including in Ann
Arbor, just as they always have been,'' Briere said.
   Briere headed the effort to gather 4,127 signatures to get the
proposal on the ballot to declare Ann Arbor a ``zone of
reproductive freedom.'' She needed 3,720 signatures. The measure
was approved last month for the April election.
   Ann Arbor residents voted overwhelmingly against a 1988 proposal
to ban state-funded abortions for poor women. The measure passed
statewide by a wide margin.
   Barbara Listing, president of the anti-abortion group Right to
Life of Michigan, views the $5 fine proposal as a publicity stunt
by those who believe a woman have a right to have abortions.
   ``I doubt very much if any city could pass a local ordinance
excluding a state penalty, especially for a felony,'' she said.
   RaeAnn Houbeck, who chairs Washtenaw County Right to Life in Ann
Arbor, urged its members to vote against the proposal.
   ``I think it sends out a message to the rest of the state sort
of naming Ann Arbor as an abortion capital of the state, which I
think is appalling,'' she said.
   The measure is patterened on an Ann Arbor charter provision that
limits the fine for marijuana possession in the city to $5, despite
stiffer penalties at the state level.
   ``I can tell you we do have more than a legal leg to stand on,''
said Briere, a secretary at the University of Michigan who is the
chairwoman of Citizens for Reproductive Freedom.
   A hefty majority in favor of the measure would be a signal to
lawmakers to avoid restrictions on abortion, said Carol King,
executive director of the Michigan Abortion Rights Action League.
   ``I think it's a statement on the part of Ann Arbor people that
they think abortion should be legal and available. I don't think
it's an empty gesture at all,'' she said.

   Federal mediators called the striking Greyhound employees' union
to Washington and may ask the company to a separate meeting in an
attempt to revive contract negotiations in the second week of the
walkout.
   Strikers continued picketing Saturday and Greyhound reported
some violence in a nationwide series of memorials Friday for a
driver killed on a California picket line.
   The Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions, which
represents 6,300 drivers and more than 3,000 office and maintenance
workers, went on strike March 2 against the only nationwide bus
company. The two sides had failed to agree on a new, three-year
contract.
   ``Our goal is to put 9,300 people back to work and we will
participate in anything that will lead to that,'' said union
spokesman Jeffery Nelson. ``We called for federal mediation in
January but the company refused.
   ``Hopefully, they are now predisposed to accept an independent
third party's involvement in the issues.''
   A Greyhound negotiator said the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service is going to meet with the union Monday ``on a
fact-finding mission.''
   ``After that happens, they might contact us. But there's been no
formal date for a meeting,'' said the negotiator, George Gravely.
   He said there were no meetings scheduled between the company and
union.
   Pickets at the Greyhound terminal in Dallas Saturday carried
copies of a letter from the Rev. Jesse Jackson urging U.S. Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole to intervene in the strike, said Don
Hardin of Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1313 in Dallas.
   Some Greyhound travel was disrupted Friday by bullets, a bomb
threat and a beating.
   In Phoenix, Greyhound officials said a passing vehicle shot
through the passenger door window of a bus en route Saturday to Los
Angeles, but there were no injuries. Police had a suspect in the
shooting, a Greyhound spokesman said.
   Strikers held memorial services Friday at terminals nationwide
for Bob Waterhouse, killed one week ago when a bus crushed him
against a wall while he was picketing in Redding, Calif.
   ``We are pleased by the wide support demonstrated by the general
public and supporting groups during yesterday's events,'' said
Nelson. ``The report from Washington's rally was great and
Cleveland and New York were gigantic. They marched at the Port
Authority'' bus terminal.
   Cleveland Mayor Michael White marched with strikers on Friday
evening, and ministers in Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis and Detroit
led prayers and had moments of silence in Waterhouse's memory, he
said.
   Tracy Nichols, a 16-year-old girl struck by a bus while walking
in a picket line in Orlando, Fla., remained in serious but
improving condition Saturday.
   In Indianapolis, about 150 strikers were joined by their
families in picketing outside a Greyhound bus terminal. Carrying
handmade signs with the messages `Go Scabhound' and `Let my Grandpa
work.''
   In central Ohio, authorities were investigating three shots
fired from a passing car that hit a Greyhound bus carrying 29
passengers. No one was injured in the shooting on Interstate 71
about 25 miles southwest of Columbus.
   Bullets struck a window near the driver, a window at the back of
the bus, and above the baggage bin, said Greyhound spokeswoman
Elizabeth Hale.
   Nelson said the union does not condone violence. ``We are fully
prepared to cooperate with local authorities should they seek our
assistance,'' he said.
   At a Seattle terminal, a Cascade Trailways bus bound for
Portland, Ore., was delayed about 30 minutes by a crowd of striking
Greyhound workers and other supporters. Police said about 20
officers helped keep order and one man was cited for misdemeanor
``pedestrian interference.''
   In Pittsburgh, union members said police beat a striking driver
as officers struggled Thursday night with pickets who were
attempting to block a bus bound for Columbus, Ohio.
   Authorities said a bomb threat prompted the evacuation of
passengers from a Greyhound bus en route from Las Vegas to Los
Angeles, but a search with bomb-sniffing dogs on Interstate 15 near
Baker, Calif., found no bomb.

   Sheriff Michael Ashe's unique solution
to chronic jail overcrowding _ commandeering a National Guard
armory _ may have unlocked new approaches to the problem, lawmen
said.
   ``In these extraordinary times you can't just sit back and
conduct your operations as business as usual,'' said Robert C.
Rufo, president of the Massachusetts Sheriff's Association.
   ``Sheriff Ashe took a real public sector entrepreneurial
approach and was highly creative,'' he said.
   Ashe got extra space for jail inmates Thursday, when a judge
approved a compromise offer from the state for the Hampden County
sheriff to move inmates from the Springfield armory to a vacant one
in Holyoke, about 10 miles to the north.
   Holyoke officials promptly launched a legal challenge, but
Hampden County Superior Court Judge George Keady refused to
immediately block the compromise. He scheduled a hearing on the
matter for next week.
   The saga began Feb. 16, when Ashe shocked state officials by
marching into the armory and ordering officials to make room for
prisoners under a 17th-century statute that orders citizens to give
``suitable aid'' to law enforcement efforts.
   The 102-year-old Hampden County jail, built to hold 279
prisoners, had reached its federal limit of 500 inmates and the
only alternative to seizing the armory was putting criminals back
on the streets, Ashe said.
   The sheriff's action, which initially met with strong resistance
from the state government, drew the support of sheriffs around the
country, Ashe said.
   ``It resurrected all of these unresolved issues, which is not
just here but all over the nation,'' he said.
   ``You have to commend the guy,'' said Dick Ford, executive
director of the American Jail Association in Hagerstown, Md. ``He
took the initiative to do something about which no one else had
acted.''
   Other sheriffs struggling with crowded jails have taken direct
action, such as self-imposed caps on jail populations, Ford said.
   In Massachusetts, sheriffs quickly called a meeting after the
armory takeover and presented a letter to Gov. Michael S. Dukakis
expressing their interest in more than two dozen National Guard
armories recently closed because of a fiscal crisis in the state.
   Rufo said the sheriffs received an encouraging response and will
meet with state officials next week to talk about the possibility
of using the empty armories to house overflow inmates.

   More than half the delegates to the Republican
State Convention endorsed Steven Pierce for governor Saturday, but
one of his chief opponents in the GOP primary vowed to stay in the
race.
   Pierce, minority leader in the Massachusetts House, received a
so-called ``supermajority'' _ a margin wide enough to allow the GOP
to endorse him before the Sept. 18 primary.
   His chief rival, William Weld, said he would remain in the race,
upsetting state GOP chairman Raymond Shamie's plan to get the party
to unite behind one candidate.
   A third GOP gubernatorial contender, Paul Cronin, failed to get
enough votes to stay in the race and won't be on the primary ballot.
   Massachusetts hasn't had a Republican governor since 1970, but
the party's fortunes rose after Democratic Gov. Michael S. Dukakis
lost his 1988 presidential bid. Dukakis returned home to find the
Massachusetts economic miracle he made a centerpiece of his
campaign had collapsed.
   ``I am very gratified and very excited about my victory today,''
Pierce said. ``We're going to win the primary. I don't know what
the margin will be.''
   The convention vote was 2,672 for Pierce, or 52.6 percent. Weld
received 1,845 votes, or 36.3 percent. Cronin garnered 563 votes,
or 11.1 percent.
   Under convention rules, candidates needed at least 15 percent of
the votes to go to the primary.
   The rules also provided that a candidate who beat his closest
rival by 15 percent or more got the supermajority, freeing the GOP
from neutrality.
   Weld, a former federal prosecutor, made it clear he planned to
continue his campaign, though he didn't question the results of the
convention vote.
   ``I think my strength is in the primary,'' said Weld, who has
positioned himself as more moderate than Pierce. ``I think it will
be a real service to the party and the voters.''
   Shamie stopped short of saying he would ask Weld to drop out.
   At first, Shamie said, ``I have no plans to ask Bill Weld to
withdraw.'' But later Saturday, he said, ``I might, I might'' when
asked the same question.
   The state that bragged of having a budget surplus and one of the
nation's lowest unemployment rates before 1988 now has a budget
deficit of more than $500 million and a jobless rate of 5.3
percent, which equals the national average. The fiscal crisis is
the top issue in the gubernatorial race.
   On the Democratic side, none of four top candidates for governor
have emerged to lead the pack. They are state Rep. John Flood,
former state Attorney General Francis Bellotti, on-leave Boston
University President John Silber and Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy.
   Republican U.S. Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia told delegates to
the GOP convention that the Democratic Party in the state is the
Democratic candidates' biggest problem.
   ``If you are running as a Democrat, if you are part of the
Democratic machine, you are the problem and electing you can't
solve it,'' Gingrich said.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ When Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril came to
power in in 1988, he talked of free elections and leading the
country toward democracy.
   Saturday, it was Avril himself who was on the move. He was
forced from power in a popular uprising by opponents who feared he
would not make good on his promises.
   Like many Haitian rulers, Avril came to power in violence and
left in violence.
   A week before the September 1988 coup that brought him to power,
thugs armed with machetes, guns and spears stormed the Roman
Catholic church of the Rev. Bertrand Aristide, a popular government
critic. They massacred a dozen people there.
   The bloodbath split the military, and lower-ranking soldiers
revolted against Lt. Henri Namphy. He was the army chief of staff
who took charge of the government after dictator Jean-Claude
Duvalier fled to France in February 1986 during another mass
uprising.
   The 1988 soldiers' rebellion was apparently not orchestrated by
Avril, then army chief of staff. But it was Avril who finally came
out on top, declaring himself president.
   He quickly went on national television and promised the
impoverished Caribbean nation democratic reform and free
presidential elections. Haitians, accustomed to lies and brutality
from their leaders, were skeptical.
   Avril, a 52-year-old with a quiet demeanor, never seemed
comfortable in the public eye. His wife, Marie-Ange, is a captain
in the army and a nurse. The couple has four children.
   Avril had been in the background as a financial adviser to
Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier, Jean-Claude's father who founded
the 29-year Duvalier family regime. Avril later advised Duvalier's
son when he replaced his father.
   Because of that close relationship, critics called Avril a
``bagman'' who reputedly became a millionaire and negotiated
military weapons and equipment sales abroad.
   Meanwhile, the Duvaliers created an authoritarian regime using
the dreaded forces known as Tonton Macoutes to keep opponents in
check.
   Despite his earlier association with the Duvaliers, Avril won
some public support a few months into his rule. He held public
meetings with civilian political leaders, talked with union leaders
and restored most of the 1987 constitution that Namphy suspended.
   He also approved the formation of an independent electoral
council to organize and oversee this year's general elections.
   Although there was skepticism, many thought it was better to
work with Avril than against him.
   ``You're not going to get power if there's not a reasonable
understanding with those guys,'' Marc Bazin, a presidential hopeful
and former World Bank economist, said at the time.
   The U.S. government has had mixed feelings about Avril's regime.
In its human rights report, it said the Haitian army was linked to
human rights abuses in rural areas but that it ``avoided the
egregious violations, massacres and politically motivated killings
_ characteristic of his predecessors.''
   Nevertheless, in March 1989, it said the resumption of $60
million in aid must be tied to democratic reform and cooperation in
fighting drug trafficking. Immediately afterward, Avril's
government accused four high-ranking army officers of drug
trafficking and discharged them.
   The next month, Avril showed he had the loyalty of his
1,100-member Presidential Guard when they put down a rebellion by
two army units.
   But Avril started looking more like a dictator.
   After the unsolved killing of an army colonel, his government
imposed a state of siege on Jan. 20, jailed 50 opposition activists
and sent seven political leaders into exile abroad. Many detainees
were reportedly beaten or tortured.
   Nearly all political parties decided to boycott elections unless
Avril stepped down.
   Speculation began to swirl Monday that Avril was on his way out
after the army killed an 11-year-old girl, apparently by accident.
Mass demonstrations followed, and at least three people were killed.
   President Bush, in a speech, mentioned Haiti in the same breath
with Cuba. This time, Avril's government was characterized as a
black mark on democracy.

   The widow of an American whose arrest and
slaying in a 1973 military coup inspired the movie ``Missing''
returned to Chile on Saturday to witness the end of Gen. Augusto
Pinochet's 16{-year rule.
   ``It's not the Chile of my nightmares,'' said Joyce Horman, who
was invited by the elected government that takes power Sunday.
   Mrs. Horman told The Associated Press in an interview that she
no longer expects any new information on her husband's death.
   ``I think it would be a very special circumstance for anyone
with direct knowledge to step forward at this time,'' she said. But
she added: ``I haven't ruled it out.''
   ``But the most important thing is that democracy is established
for Chileans, that there is respect for human rights.''
   Her husband, Charles Horman, then 29, was among thousands of
people arrested when Pinochet seized power in a bloody coup on
Sept. 11, 1973. It toppled the elected government of President
Salvador Allende, a Marxist. Horman, a free-lance journalist, and
his wife were living in Chile at the time.
   According to the family and testimony collected by human rights
groups, Horman was among many suspected dissidents held and
executed at Santiago's National Stadium. The military government
has denied the allegations.
   Horman's father, Ed Horman, pressed for years for details on his
son's death and wrote a book about his efforts. The book provided
the story for the movie ``Missing,'' starring Sissy Spacek as
Horman's wife and Jack Lemmon as the father.
   The movie is officially banned in Chile. ``Maybe now they'll
show it,'' Mrs. Horman said.
   In the AP interview, she said she found the country much more
open and friendly than it was when she and her father-in-law were
ushered out by U.S. diplomats and military authorities on Oct. 18,
1973.
   ``The air feels lighter. It's a different place,'' she said.
``It's not the place I remember.''
   Both Mrs. Horman, a 45-year-old computer specialist, and
Horman's father live in New York City. Horman's father is not
attending the inauguration.
   On Monday, the National Stadium will be the site of a massive
celebration to mark the end of Pinochet's rule.
   Patricio Aylwin, a 71-year-old Christian Democrat, was the
candidate of a center-left coalition that defeated Pinochet in Dec.
14 national elections, winning 55 percent of the vote.
   Mrs. Horman was one of about 400 people invited by Aylwin to
witness the change of government.

   Musher Susan Butcher gobbled a hot,
six-course meal early Saturday as a reward for leading racers into
this Yukon River settlement in the 18th annual Iditarod Trail Sled
Dog Race.
   The gourmet meal is traditional for the first musher to reach
Ruby, which is more than halfway in the 1,160-mile endurance run
across mountains, rivers, ice and tundra. In addition to the meal
of veal lafitte with a Thai shrimp appetizer, chocolate cheescake
and other delights, she collected $2,500 in cash for being first
into Ruby.
   Seventy teams left Anchorage March 3 in the annual race to Nome.
Leaders reached the official halfway point Friday at Cripple.
   Butcher grabbed the lead from Lavon Barve, who had headed the
pack for several days.
   ``There's a definite top five now and they're the same top five
from last year,'' Butcher said.
   Leaders kept up with Butcher Saturday afternoon as they raced
for the next checkpoint at Galena, 52 miles up the Yukon River.
   Barve was second into Ruby, followed by Dee Dee Jonrowe,
defending champion Joe Runyan and Tim Osmar.
   Butcher said the hot food was welcome after living on dried
rations.
   ``I just threw in some emergency food, a pretty bad selection,''
Butcher said.
   The Iditarod, which commemorates a 1925 dogsled run to bring
life-saving diphtheria serum to Nome, is named for a ghost town on
the route.
   A Wyoming musher, Frank Teasley, was disqualified Saturday, when
a race judge declared that his dogs were too sick to continue
because of a virus that has hit other teams as well. The judge
found there wasn't any negligence by Teasley's.
   Teasley's disqualification came just days after he killed a
moose that he said was terrorizing another team along the trail.

   Reformers who occupied a museum in the Georgian
city of Tbilisi on Saturday were among protesters in at least four
cities who demanded change, according to activists and news reports.
   In the Ukrainian city of Kiev, an activist said a crowd
estimated at 50,000 gathered for a pro-democracy election rally.
   In Nazran, thousands of Ingushi residents held their fifth day
of protests, calling for restoration of their autonomous republic
in their southern homeland, Tass reported.
   Hundreds of thousands of Ingushi residents were deported from
their homes in the Caucasus in 1944 after dictator Josef Stalin
accused them of collaboration with the Nazis.
   Ingushi protesters insisted their demand for restoration of
their homeland did not mean they intended to oust the Ossetians now
living in the area, Tass said. There is a Checheno-Ingushi
republic, but much of the Ingushi land was allocated to what is now
Northern Ossetia when the natives were deported.
   In Tbilisi, a crowd gathered at the Museum of Marxism-Leninism
and then occupied it to demand office space for non-Communist
political groups. Authorities agreed, and the incident ended
peacefully.
   The crowd was estimated by police at 1,200 and by activists at
3,000.
   In Kiev, speakers said election rigging was rampant in the
Ukraine. But democratic candidates for the Ukrainian parliament
have still won 33 races and advanced to runoffs in 120 others, said
Yaroslav Tropimov of the Rukh people's front.
   Activists claim 10 percent of the ballots cast in the town of
Ivankov were falsified to benefit Ukrainian Communist Party second
secretary Stanislav Gurenko, Tropimov said.
   Both the Tbilisi and the Kiev activists spoke against Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's request for vastly expanded powers,
activists said.
   Gorbachev's proposal to create a Soviet presidency is scheduled
for adoption on Monday.

   About 100 demonstrators entered the Haitian
consulate in Miami on Saturday, demanding a say in naming a new
consul following the resignation of Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril as the
nation's military ruler.
   The protesters, most of them Haitian exiles, climbed the walls
outside the downtown consulate and entered the empty building.
   The group occupied the offices for several hours until an armed
FBI unit, State Department officials and a police SWAT team arrived
and talked them into surrendering, said FBI spokesman Paul Miller.
   Miller said the FBI decided against making arrests immediately
``because of the emotions involved.'' No one was injured, he said.
Miller initially estimated the number of protesters at 40 or 50,
but later revised the number upward.
   Some of the demonstrators carried papers apparently taken from
the consulate, but no material was confiscated from them, Miller
said.
   Avril, who came to power in September 1988 in a coup, stepped
down Saturday and Maj. Gen. Herard Abraham promised to transfer
power to a panel led by the Supreme Court president by Monday.
   Moments after word reached Miami's Little Haiti section,
spontaneous celebrations erupted.
   But Haitian exile leader Gerard Jean-Juste sounded a note of
caution. He noted it was the fifth transition of power in Haiti
since February 1986, when dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to
exile.
   ``We are more mature now. We have seen this before and the
country fell into repression,'' said Jean-Juste, director of
Miami's Haitian Refugee Center.
   Jean-Juste said Miami's Haitian community would push for a new
consulate staff and oppose the appointment of a consul linked to
the Avril regime.
   ``We want someone from our own community. It's the one thing we
hope to come out of this,'' he said.

   Vice President Dan Quayle, arriving
Saturday to celebrate Chile's return to democracy, said the United
States expects outgoing President General Augusto Pinochet to honor
``a new era'' of civilian rule despite his continued control of the
military.
   Under the constitution his regime wrote, Pinochet still heads
Chile's 60,000-member military.
   But Quayle told reporters traveling with him that the ultimate
authority is Patricio Aylwin, being inaugurated president Sunday.
   On another matter, Quayle raised the possibility of talking with
outgoing Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, also here for Aylwin's
inauguration.
   He noted that the Feb. 25 elections in Nicaragua and Ortega's
promise to abide by the results and turn over power to Violeta
Chamorro makes it ``a different situation now'' and leaves ``no
reason that I shouldn't talk'' to Ortega.
   He said no meeting with Ortega was scheduled, but added that ``I
anticipate it could happen.''
   During a brief airport arrival ceremony Saturday night, Quayle
congratulated Chileans for bringing `the dawn of a new era of
democracy'' through election.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., a member of the U.S. party and
sponsor of an arms ban against Chile, responded to Chilean
reporters seeking a comment by proclaiming: ``It's extraordinary to
breath the free air of Chile. Tomorrow is a day that I would not
have missed in all the world.''
   Quayle was to meet Sunday with Pinochet for what he called ``a
short meeting in the line of protocol.'' He said he would carry
messages from various individuals, including President Bush.
   During his stay in Chile, Quayle said he expected to raise the
matter of the United States continued unsuccessful attempts to
extradite two Chilean military officers wanted for trial in the
1976 killing in Washington of exiled former Chilean cabinet
minister Orlando Letelier.
   Earlier in Bridgetown, Barbados, Quayle wrapped up talks with
Caribbean leaders by pledging greater U.S. assistance to the region.
   Chile became the last country in South America to return to
democracy.
   A potentially troubled future already looms, with Pinochet
insisting on retaining control of the country's 60,000 strong
military and victims of human rights abuses vowing to file
thousands of criminal complaints against the military.
   Pinochet called the Dec. 14 election that Aylwin won after
voters rejected a referendum in October 1988 that would have
extended his rule to 1997.
   Quayle on Saturday met with six Caribbean heads of state in a
session hosted by Barbados Prime Minister Lloyd Erskine Sandiford.
   Quayle told reporters the meeting focused on economic
development issues of concern to Barbados, Dominica, St. Vincent
and the Grenadines, St. Kitts, St. Lucia and Antigua.
   ``I had it pointed out to me very clearly ... the lack of
adequate contribution this year,'' from the United States to the
region, he said.
   ``I believe next year we will be able to do better,'' he added,
but refused to give any dollar amounts.
   The talks covered educational opportunities and ``reforms in the
way we approach agriculture,'' and other economic development,
Quayle said.
   They touched only briefly on anti-drug cooperation, said
Quayle's press secretary, David Beckwith. The meeting came a day
after the Pentagon announced it would increase aircraft and warship
presence in the Caribbean to step up interdiction efforts.
   Quayle repeated what is becoming a refrain for his trip to
Barbados and South America. He said people in the region should not
believe the United States is overlooking them because of the
intense interest in the Eastern Europe reforms.
   ``We are interested in the world, and we are particularly
interested in the Western Hemisphere,'' he said.
   ``We are all Americans,'' he said, adding the Caribbean is ``a
priority'' with Bush.

   Police have charged a 39-year-old man with
placing a fake bomb at a synagogue featured in the movie ``Driving
Miss Daisy.''
   Gerald Bertolini of Forest Park was scheduled for arraignment on
a misdemeanor charge Monday, said Atlanta Police Lt. LaSalle Smith.
   A package discovered on the front steps of The Temple March 3
caused the evacuation of 150 people attending a bat mitzvah. The
package, wrapped in garbage bags and made to look like a bomb, also
contained a videocassette tape and messages to Coretta Scott King
and a local television anchorwoman.
   Smith alleged that Bertolini's name was found inside the package.
   Police said they don't believe Bertolini has a police record or
a history of violence, or racist or anti-Semitic acts, but they
haven't established a motive for the hoax.
   The Temple was bombed in 1958 in an attack that some said
prompted religious leaders in the city to come together to fight
anti-Semitism. Nobody was injured in the 1958 bombing, which
blasted a 20-foot hole in a wall of the synagogue.
   That bombing figures in ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' about an elderly
Jewish woman's friendship with her black chauffeur.

   An organization of Colorado physicians may no
longer negotiate prices with hospitals and insurance companies on
behalf of its members, a federal judge has ruled in a lawsuit
brought by the state.
   The ruling Friday concluded a state attorney general's
price-fixing investigation into the Colorado Union of Physicians
and Surgeons, which has more than 100 members.
   State Attorney General Duane Woodard said U.S. District Judge
Sherman G. Finesilver barred the organization from acting as a
collective bargaining unit on behalf of the physicians it
represents, many of whom are in direct competition.
   The group's telephone number is unlisted.
   A state complaint contended the organization violated federal
and state antitrust laws by engaging in a pattern of price-fixing.
   Woodard said the organization, with members in Denver and
Pueblo, ``is not a bona fide labor union and its physician members
are not employees.''
   ``Therefore, the collective bargaining done by CUPS with various
hospitals and health insurance plans is an illegal restraint of
trade and amounts to price-fixing,'' he said.
   The organization agreed in a settlement of the complaint to pay
the state $8,000 for investigative costs and attorney's fees.
   The complaint said the doctors' group and its members agreed on
reimbursement for providing medical services to patients, then
would negotiate for increased compensation with insurance
companies, hospitals and health maintenance organizations.
   The complaint alleged that the group and its members threatened
termination of existing contracts with insurance companies,
hospitals and health maintenance organizations and threatened
patients with billing on a ``fee for service basis'' if the
companies refused to cooperate.
   Garth Lucero, first assistant attorney general, said a ``fee for
service basis'' meant a patient would have been unable to get
reimbursed for medical treatment.

   The National Assembly on Saturday
pardoned both the Contra rebels and Sandinista government workers
accused of wrongdoing in a sweeping amnesty law of ``national
reconciliation.''
   ``We must avoid political vengeance and block any moves by
hotheads in the National Opposition Union,'' said Carlos Nunez,
president of the legislature. He was apparently referring to
possible reprisals against Sandinista government workers after the
opposition takes over April 25.
   The amnesty was proposed by leftist President Daniel Ortega
after he lost the Feb. 25 presidential elections to Violeta Barrios
de Chamorro, who headed the National Opposition Union's ticket.
   The leftist Sandinistas control the National Assembly, and
lawmakers passed the law on a vote of 72 in favor with six
abstentions. Only 78 of the 96 members were present.
   The law absolves Nicaraguans, ``residents or not in the country,
who commit crimes against public order and against internal
security of the state.''
   The U.S.-backed Contras, who have fought to overthrow the
Sandinistas, have resisted calls from the outgoing and incoming
governments to lay down their weapons. About 11,000 Contras are
based in border camps in Honduras.
   The ``Law of General Amnesty and Reconciliation'' was introduced
Thursday, replacing an earlier version that prompted significant
opposition. The wording of the new version was changed to make the
amnesty more sweeping.
   The amnesty covers public employees who ``presumably committed
crimes of failing in their duties, fraud or theft and have not been
prosecuted'' between July 1979, when the Sandinistas came to power,
and the day the law takes effect.
   Legislators said it will take effect between March 20-23 when it
is published in the official government gazette.
   Edwin Illescas of the Democratic Conservative Party said he
supported the law because he recognized that by holding elections,
the Sandinistas were working for peace. He said similar laws had
been passed in Argentina, Uruguay and Chile and hastened the return
of democracy.
   The law says it is designed ``to contribute to the national
reconciliation of all the sectors of society with the goal of peace
and tranquillity to Nicaraguan families.''
   ``The union of Nicaraguan families needs the pardon and to
forget those deeds that brought anxiety and restlessness in the
nation.''
   ``The law is not to protect criminals'' but benefits ``people
who have worked more than 10 years protecting the revolution,''
Nunez said.
   The Sandinistas hold 61 seats in the present legislature to 35
for the opposition. The 14-party National Opposition Union will
hold a majority in the new legislature, with the Sandinistas
remaining the largest single party.

<HEAD>Former Foreign Secretary, Lord Stewart Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former British Foreign Secretary Michael Stewart
died Saturday at Charing Cross Hospital after a brief illness, a
hospital spokesman said. He was 83.
   The nature of Stewart's illness was not disclosed.
   During 1964-70 Stewart served as foreign secretary twice in the
Labor government of former Prime Minister Harold Wilson. He also
held the position of secretary of state for economic affairs.
   Stewart was a Labor member of Parliament for 34 years before
receiving a life peerage in 1979. He became Lord Stewart of Fulham
and moved into the House of Lords, where he remained active until
his illness.
   As foreign secretary during the Vietnam war, Stewart came under
pressure from the opposition Conservative Party for the
government's policy, which refused to commit troops to aid the
United States. He also faced criticism from left-wing Labor Party
members who believed that the government was too sympathetic to the
United States.
   The London-born former school teacher graduated from Oxford
University and served in the Army Intelligence Corps during World
War II.
   Lady Stewart, the former Mary Birkinshaw, died in 1985. The
Stewarts had no children.

   To supporters' cheers and opponents'
cries of ``murderer,'' right-wing Gen. Augusto Pinochet ended his
last full day in power Saturday with a call for national unity
behind his elected successor.
   Pinochet was snubbed by 10 foreign leaders, who delayed their
arrivals for Sunday's inaugural ceremonies until he hands over
power to Patricio Aylwin. Only three heads of state arrived during
the day Saturday.
   In a taped good-bye speech broadcast nationally on television
and radio Saturday night, Pinochet called on his countrymen ``to
unite their forces to those of the new authorities.''
   ``The president who is assuming power has the right to expect,
from each of us, a responsible attitude,'' he said, standing erect
in a white dress army uniform with the presidential sash.
   ``I want the best for my country, and I always will be ready to
serve her,'' Pinochet said.
   The 74-year-old general plans to stay on as commander of the
60,000-man army, despite requests by Aylwin that he fully retire.
   In 1988, a proposal to extend Pinochet's rule to 1997 was
defeated in a referendum, and the loss forced him to call elections
last December.
   Aylwin, a 71-year-old Christian Democrat backed by a coalition
of 17 centrist and leftist parties, won 55 percent of the vote. His
closest challenger, a former Pinochet finance minister, won 29
percent.
   Pinochet feted visiting dignitaries in the presidential palace
Saturday afternoon.
   Those who arrived Saturday included presidents Alberto LaCalle
of Uruguay, Carlos Menem of Argentina and Jose Sarney of Brazil.
Their visits ended years of international political isolation for
the general.
   Among those delaying their arrivals were presidents Carlos
Andres Perez of Venezuela, Alan Garcia of Peru, Daniel Ortega of
Nicaragua, and prime ministers Giulio Andreotti of Italy and Felipe
Gonzalez of Spain.
   Chilean Foreign Minister Hernan Errazuriz criticized their
decisions, saying they displayed ``a lack of education.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle arrived late Saturday from Venezuela
and planned to meet with Pinochet at his residence in a Santiago
neighborhood Sunday morning. Speaking at the airport, Quayle said
the United States expects Pinochet to honor ``a new era'' of
civilian rule.
   Traveling with Quayle was Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
despised by Pinochet and his supporters for his outspoken criticism
of human rights abuses under the military government. Kennedy
sponsored a 1976 ban, still in effect, on U.S. arms sales to Chile.
   Except for a papal tour in 1987, the last visit by a head of
state to Chile was that of Brazilian military President Joao
Figueiredo in 1982. Pinochet's last attempt to go abroad, in 1980,
had to be aborted when then-Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos
withdrew an invitiation even though Pinochet already was in
mid-flight.
   Pinochet left the three-story presidential palace late Saturday
afternoon for the last time by the front door, to both cheers and
boos.
   ``Viva Pinochet!'' shouted supporters.
   Others cried ``Murderer!'' and yelled obscenities as he climbed
into his armored Mercedes Benz and drove off with his customary,
heavily armed military escort.
   As he took his leave after ruling for 16{ years, some palace
functionaires wept. But he gently chided them: ``No one has died
here.'' He called on everyone ``to keep working.''
   Workmen in Valparaiso, a resort town near Santiago, prepared a
new, half-finished congressional palace for Sunday's inaugural
ceremony. Others in Santiago swept up debris from a series of small
terrorist bomb blasts Friday that left one person injured.
   About 40 relatives and sympathizers of leftists jailed on
terrorism charges staged a protest inside Santiago's downtown
cathedral on Saturday, occupying the pews. But the protest was
peaceful and they vacated the building without incident after about
seven hours.
   A spokesman for the protesters, Mirnas Rivas, told reporters:
``There can be no transition to democracy in Chile if political
prisoners aren't freed.'' Aylwin has said he favors freeing
prisoners of conscience but not those convicted of guerrilla or
terrorist actions.
   The military government says all of those now jailed are charged
or convicted in connection with guerrilla activity.
   Pinochet took power in September 1973 in a bloody coup that
toppled the elected government of President Salvador Allende, an
avowed Marxist, during a period of political and economic disorder.
   He suspended congress and launched a harsh crackdown on leftists
and dissidents that earned his government a worldwide reputation
for systematic human rights abuses.
   Also attending Aylwin's inauguration will be Joyce Horman, widow
of Charles Horman, an American free-lance journalist whose arrest
and killing during the 1973 coup inspired the movie ``Missing.''
   According to the family and testimony collected by human rights
groups, Horman was among many suspected dissidents held and
executed at Santiago's National Stadium. The military government
has denied the allegations.
   Mrs. Horman of New York was invited by the new government and
was expected to attend several events surrounding the inauguration.
She arrived Saturday.
   Police said at least 11 small bombs went off across Santiago
during a 45-minute period late Friday night. No one claimed
responsibility for the blasts.
   In one of the explosions, in an underground tool shed at a city
park near the downtown U.S. Consulate, one worker was injured in
the face and hands, police said.
   Other bombs went off at or near several government offices, a
Mormon chapel, a courthouse, an army colonel's house and two
businesses. Aylwin characterized the bombings as ``strange.''
   He spoke to reporters in front of his home before leaving for
Valparaiso, where he planned to spend the night.
   Small groups of leftist extremists are active in Chile, but
there is widespread suspicion that at least in some cases the
attacks attributed to them are the work of rightists who want to
exaggerate the leftist threat.

<HEAD>L.A. Archbishop Seeks Nuns, Priests to Test AIDS Vaccine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles
has asked elderly nuns and priests to volunteer to be inoculated
with an experimental AIDS vaccine.
   Archbishop Roger Mahony has sent a letter to the 3,500 priests
and nuns in the Los Angeles archdiocese, seeking 10 volunteers age
65 or older. The prototype vaccine was developed by Dr. Jonas Salk,
father of the commercial polio vaccine.
   The appeal was first reported by the Chicago Tribune, which said
some scientists are concerned about the proposed experiment and the
safety of Salk's vaccine. That is because the prototype vaccine is
the only one among several being developed that is made from the
whole AIDS virus.
   Critics say that if live strains of the virus contaminate the
vacine, the volunteers could be accidentally infected, the paper
said in its Sunday editions.
   The main reason for seeking volunteers from the ranks of the
church was that they presumably would be most unlikely to have been
infected with AIDS through the two most common means _ sexual
intercourse or intravenous drug use, the paper said.
   The Rev. Kevin Kostelnik, who was working Saturday night at St.
Vibiana's Church adjacent to Mahony's residence, said a letter
requesting volunteers was sent out two months ago.
   ``The letter really didn't go into detail,'' Kostelnik said. ``I
work in the office so I didn't see the need to respond to it.''
   Kostelnik said he couldn't recall the details of the letter, but
that it was sent to all the nuns and priests in Los Angeles and was
seeking five to ten volunteers.
   Mahony is in Rome until March 19, Kostelnik said.
   Scores of Americans were infected with polio in the early 1950s
when Salk used the same technique in developing the polio vaccine
that eventually saved thousands of lives.
   A government investigation later determined the infections
resulted when the virus contained in the vaccine hadn't been
killed, as it was supposed to have been.
   Thus, if any of the volunteers were to test positive later for
the AIDS virus, the infection could be traced directly to live
virus that had contaminated the vaccine.
   The appeal by Mahony to the religious community was accompanied
by a letter in which Dr. Brian Henderson of the University of
Southern California said Salk would be the first volunteer.
   The 75-year-old Salk works at the La Jolla, Calif., institute
that bears his name.
   Henderson, one of Salk's collaborators, added another reason for
appealing to priests and nuns: the need for ``individuals who would
find a role as such a volunteer a meaningful part of their life.''
   Salk said he hasn't inoculated himself or any voluteers because
the proposed experiment had yet to be approved by California
authorities, the Tribune said.
   Salk developed the first polio vaccine, which was pronounced
safe and effective on April 12, 1955. The dead-virus vaccine was
administered by injection.
   In the 1960s, an oral polio vaccine was developed by Dr. Albert
Sabin, and it has generally replaced the Salk vaccine, in part
because of the ease of giving it. The vaccine developed by Sabin is
also more potent and long-lasting, but because it uses tamed live
virus, one of about every 3.2 million doses results in paralytic
polio, according to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haitian ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper
Avril, who rose to power 18 months ago in a revolt by pro-democracy
soldiers, resigned Saturday during a popular uprising against his
military regime.
   The embattled Haitian leader turned over power to Maj. Gen.
Herard Abraham, the army chief of staff, who said he would transfer
rule to a civilian-led government within 72 hours. Abraham said the
interim government would prepare for elections but did not give a
date.
   Diplomat sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Avril
would leave the country within two days. There was no word on where
he would go and how he would get there.
   Immediately after Avril's resignation, members of a coalition of
opposition parties disagreed over the provisions for Abraham's rule
and there also was discord over who would lead the civilian
government. The opposition members later met with Abraham and it
was not immediately known whether they reached agreement. They
scheduled a news conference for Sunday morning.
   It was Haiti's fifth change of government since February 1986,
when dictator Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier fled the
impoverished Caribbean nation into exile in France.
   Avril's departure followed five days of mass protests. His
opponents said they no longer trusted him to usher in fair
elections that had been scheduled for October.
   Thousands of residents poured into the streets of the capital to
celebrate. Youths erected flaming tire barricades at major
intersections, and black smoke filled the sky over the capital.
   The television station Tele-Haiti said teen-agers shouted
slogans outside the house of a special police agent in the slum
suburb of Martissant, and that the agent and backers ``wildly''
opened fire, killing six. Radio Metropole said seven were killed.
   Sporadic gunfire was heard throughout the capital,
Port-au-Prince, and there were power outages in some neighborhoods.
   Independent Radio Metropole said the houses of some Duvalier and
Avril sympathizers had been ransacked and their cars burned. On
radio talk shows, callers demanded that Avril be thrown out of the
country.
   Abraham, in uniform, appeared on state television at 3:05 p.m.
EST to announce Avril's resignation.
   ``In light of the resignation of the military government of Lt.
Gen. Prosper Avril, the armed forces of Haiti accept the heavy
task,'' Abraham said in French.
   ``The mission is clear and the objective is precise: to
re-establish peace and order within 72 hours so, in conformity with
the constitution, a provisional government can organize elections.''
   Abraham and the army want to give the interim presidency to
Supreme Court President Gilbert Austin, who had been appointed by
Avril as chief justice last year after serving as the general's
justice minister.
   However, the opposition coalition _ called the Unity Assembly _
said he would be a puppet of the army and that it wanted him to
resign as president of the high court.
   ``It is the president of the Supreme Court who, according to the
constitution, should be president,'' Austin said Saturday night.
   There had been speculation that 51-year-old Avril wanted to
return to his old job as army chief of staff. However, Tele-Haiti,
an independent television station, said he was retiring from the
army.
   Radio Metropole said Avril left the palace Saturday afternoon
and was at his private residence in the wealthy suburb of Canape
Vert, on the hills overlooking Port-au-Prince.
   Conservative leader Hubert De Ronceray, one of seven prominent
politicians forced into exile in a government crackdown in January,
said Avril's resignation was ``an encouraging first step.''
   ``But Prosper Avril is still a public danger if he stays in
Haiti,'' said De Ronceray, speaking by telephone from Miami.
   Another exile, Louis Roy, principal author of Haiti's 1987
constitution, said from the Caribbean island of Martinique that the
Haitian people had ``risen and overthrown a regime which had tried
to destroy its desire for a democratic form of government.''
   But, he added: ``It remains to be seen whether the army deserves
the confidence which has been placed in it.''
   In Washington, the Bush administration welcomed the promise by
Haiti's new leader to set the stage for national elections by
turning over power within 72 hours.
   The statement said the United States long has called for
improved human rights in Haiti and added: ``We obviously hope the
latest developments contribute to a realization of this objective.''
   Tele-Haiti said the interim president would be advised by an
11-member council representing civic groups, churches, the army and
eight provincial districts.
   Earlier, the opposition coalition had said it wanted Supreme
Court vice president Gabriel Volcy as the new provisional head. But
Antoine Izmery, a prominent businessman who belongs to the Unity
Assembly, said Volcy refused.
   He said ``it's an all-out war'' if Abraham remains in power for
72 hours.
   However, other political leaders were more conciliatory.
   Mark Bazin, an economist who leads a center-right party said he
was ``reassured about Abraham's good faith to play according to the
rules.'' He did not elaborate.
   Avril came to power in September 1988 in a coup by
non-commissioned officers. He promised to hand over power to a
civilian government after elections this fall. But critics said a
brutal crackdown in January on government critics made clear that
Avril intended to renege on that promise and make himself a
dictator.
   Speculation Avril might be on his way out began growing Monday
after a soldier killed an 11-year-old girl, apparently accidentally
during a demonstration. The killing set off a spate of violent
anti-government protests across the country that resulted in the
deaths of at least three people.
   Haiti, the poorest country in the hemisphere, has been ruled by
force of arms for most of its history since independence from
France in 1804.
   After Jean-Claude Duvalier went into exile in 1986, he was
replaced by Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, Duvalier's army chief of staff.
He headed a three-man provisional junta that was to rule until
elections for a new government.
   The first election attempt in November 1987 was called off hours
into the vote after thugs killed at least 34 voters and confiscated
ballots. In January 1988, Leslie Manigat, a university professor,
was elected president. Few Haitians voted, and most opposition
leaders refused to participate.
   Five months later, Namphy entered the picture again. His troops
deposed Manigat, who had tried to fire Namphy. Avril replaced
Namphy in the coup of September 1988.

   The Senate agreed Friday to protect cities

their pollution comes from Mexico.
   The government, in assessing whether a city or region is in
compliance with clean air standards, would have to consider whether
the emissions originate across the border, according to the
amendment to the clean air bill.
   ``Without this amendment, if the pollution in Juarez continues
to get worse, it could technically shut down El Paso because of

   ``It is imperative to not let cities along the border, in Texas,

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Friday unanimously confirmed
John R. Dunne to be assistant attorney general for civil rights,
filling a 15-month-old vacancy at the Justice Department.
   Dunne, a former New York state senator with little prior
involvement in civil rights issues, was confirmed by voice vote. A
day earlier, the Senate Judiciary Committee had recommended Dunne
despite criticism over his former memberships in clubs that
excluded women and stock holdings in a company that does business
in South Africa
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum D-Ohio, the only committee member to vote
against Dunne on Thursday, complained that Dunne ``will probably be
as good an appointee to head the division as we are going to get
from this administration.''
   Dunne, 60, of Garden City, N.Y., was nominated in January for
the post, which had been vacant since December 1988 when William
Bradford Reynolds resigned.
   President Bush's first choice for the job, William C. Lucas of
Michigan, a former sheriff and county executive, was rejected by
the Judiciary Committee by a 7-7 vote last August. Lucas had spent
most of his career in law enforcement and had little litigation
experience. He was opposed by many civil rights organizations.
   A virtual unknown in Washington, Dunne played a minor role in
Bush's New York campaign. He had a powerful booster in Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh, whom he has known since 1972 when they
traveled to Japan among a group of young American political leaders.
   Dunne was a New York state senator for 24 years, resigning last
year after losing a race for majority leader. Dunne is a partner in
the Uniondale, N.Y., law firm of Rivkin, Radler, Dunne &amp; Bayh.
   Civil rights groups criticized Dunne's almost non-existent civil
rights record, but none opposed his nomination. Many had praise for
the work he did helping to reform the New York prison system after
the deadly 1971 riot at Attica state prison.
   But Dunne drew fire for having held longtime memberships in the
Fort Orange Club in Albany, N.Y., and the Garden City Golf Club on
Long Island, N.Y. The Fort Orange admitted women in 1988; the golf
club is still sex-segregated.
   During his confirmation hearing, Dunne expressed regret at
having joined the clubs.
   As for his nearly $20,000 worth of stock in a company doing
business in South Africa, Dunne expressed willingness to divest it.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reuters filed court papers Friday opposing
United Press International's request for a preliminary injunction
barring Reuters from backing out of a picture exchange agreement.
   The memorandum was in response to a counterclaim made by UPI to
a Reuters' lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Manhattan that seeks
to void the contract between the two news services.
   Reuters denied allegations made by UPI that it had ``poached''
certain UPI clients, taken away employees and was trying to drive
UPI out of business.
   ``It is a collection of inflammatory statements based on no
authority whatever or on serious distortions of the documents at
issue,'' Reuters said.
   Oral arguments on the request for a preliminary injunction will
be heard Monday by Judge Peter K. Leisure. A temporary restraining
order against Reuters is in effect until the judge decides whether
to issue the injunction.
   Milt Capps, UPI's senior vice president for corporate affairs,
was traveling and not available for comment, his office said.
   The agreement at issue was entered into in 1984 and called for
UPI to supply Reuters with pictures from the United States, while
Reuters would provide UPI with pictures from other countries. It
was to run for 10 years.
   Last month Reuters said the agreement was not living up to its
expectations and it was terminating it. UPI is opposing such a move.

   Comedian Pat Paulsen, a perennial
presidential candidate, has announced plans to enter the race for
the last time in 1992. But first, he said, he will run for mayor of
Longboat Key.
   Paulsen unveiled his plans at a beach resort Thursday.
   ``My good friend _ what's his name? _ Dr. Murf Klauber, asked me
to come down and straighten the town out,'' Paulsen said. ``I'm
down here to take the shackles off of Longboat, get some more
involved people as commissioners.''
   Paulsen announced tongue-in-cheek plans for local improvements.
   ``See that sand out there,'' he said pointing to the beach. ``It
gets in your shoes. I think it should be paved over.''
   That should squelch concerns about beach erosion, he said.
   What about the turtles? ``Who needs turtles?'' he said.
   Paulsen said he had $79 in his treasury before his Florida stop.
   In his 1972 run for president, Paulsen said he captured 2
percent of the vote in the New Hampshire primary and should have
been elected.
   ``I can't run a tape recorder,'' he said. ``I would have been in
no trouble.''
   His slogan is ``Pat Who? in '92.''
   The 62-year-old Paulsen said his chances look good this time _
his last to hit the trail _ if he runs as a Democrat.
   ``They don't know which way is up,'' he said. ``There will be
lots of comedians in the race, especially the Democrats.''

<TEXT>
   Air Force plans to build a $2.5 billion
electronic battlefield in Utah have been scrapped because of cuts
in the military budget, Sen. Jake Garn said.
   Garn, R-Utah, met Thursday with Air Force Lt. Col. Neal Branford
and an Air Force fiscal analyst. The senator had sought the meeting
following rumors that the future of the battlefield proposed for
Utah's western desert was in jeopardy.
   Garn said the Air Force officials told him that given the
military budget cuts President Bush has proposed, and with Congress
expected to make even deeper cuts in the Pentagon budget, the
battlefield ``simply will not be built.'' The officials also said
the costs of the battlefield had grown over what they had
originally estimated, Garn said.
   The Air Force requested no money for the battlefield in the
fiscal 1991 budget. The Air Force officials told Garn their
projected five-year budget also includes no money for the
battlefield.
   Garn said, however, that operational electronic warfare
simulation ranges in other states, most likely Nevada and
California, will be upgraded.
   Rumors in military and civilian circles have pointed to plans
for augmenting electronic battle capability projects at Fallon
Naval Station in Nevada and at the China Lake Naval Weapons Station
in California.
   The electronic battlefield, known in the Air Force as Electronic
Combat Test Capability, simulates enemy defense systems such as
radio- and radar-jamming devices and radar signals from
surface-to-air missiles.
   Opponents of the Utah battlefield, which would have sprinkled
sophisticated electronic combat simulation devices throughout the
state's west desert, were jubilant over the announcement.
   ``I feel real good about it,'' said Juab County Commissioner
Richard Brough. ``It was just an excuse on the part of the Air
Force to get more airspace. That's all it amounted to.''
   Desert ranchers had been worried about the effect of low-level
warplane flights on herds.

   Customs officers found 110 pounds of
heroin in the fuel tank of a truck from Turkey, and on Friday the
driver was arrested, authorities said. It was one of Britain's
largest heroin seizures.
   The heroin, with a street value of at least $7 million, was
discovered late Thursday when the truck arrived at the southeastern
port of Ramsgate on a cross-channel ferry, officials said.
   The driver had driven a cargo of rugs from Turkey to Dunkirk,
France, where he boarded the ferry, they said.
   The heroin, concealed in a secret compartment, was discovered
during a routine check.
   ``Turkey is a source-country for heroin and we carry out random
checks,'' said a customs spokesman, who was not identified in
accordance with British practice. ``This time we struck it lucky.''
   The driver, Ihsan Uskupluoglu, 27, was charged with illegally
importing heroin, Customs said.

<TEXT>
   The war of words between the Bush
administration and House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt spread
to the Senate floor Friday as the No.2 Republican called Gephardt
``a frustrated font of trivia.''
   ``Old Richard is just going bananas,'' Sen. Alan Simpson,
R-Wyo., the assistant GOP leader, said in a five-minute floor
speech devoted primarily to attacks on Gephardt.
   Gephardt this week criticized President Bush for failing to
wield leadership in Eastern Europe and proposed to provide direct
economic aid to the Soviet Union. White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater fired back that Gephardt has become the ``Maxwell Smart''
of politics, likening the Missouri Democrat to the bumbling
character of the 1960s ``Get Smart'' TV show.
   Simpson, while acknowledging that Gephardt is talented and
articulate, complained he ``has taken some pretty personal potshots
at the president ... He seems to delight in that. I think its time
to take a swift look at the institutional life of this frustrated
font of trivia about our fine president.''
   Simpson said Gephardt's criticism was prompted by the failure of
his race for the Democratic presidential nomination and the success
of the Bush campaign for the White House.
   ``It doesn't take any brains to be a critic,'' Simpson said.
``Anyone can qualify. All you need is a shrill voice and usually a
human target.''
   Gephardt communications director David Dreyer said in a
statement that it ``shows a low opinion of the American people when
the Republicans launch a personal attack against Congressman
Gephardt, who is urging greater American leadership to advance
democracy in the Eastern Bloc.''

<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Puerto Rican nationalists burned
and stomped on an American flag Friday to protest congressional
hearings on the island's future ties with the United States.
   The protest by dozens of independence supporters coincided with
the first of three days of hearings in San Juan by an eight-member
congressional delegation. Eighty witnesses are scheduled to testify
on a proposed referendum in June 1991 on the Caribbean island's
future.
   About 100 protesters calling themselves the Socialist Front
Against the Plebiscite carried signs saying ``No to Colonialism''
and ``Independence'' outside the hearings at the Fine Arts
Performing Center. They also sang the Puerto Rican anthem.
   Some of the protesters then torched the U.S. flag and stomped on
it before peacefully dispersing.
   Voters are to choose whether Puerto Rico will become the 51st
state, gain independence or take on an ``enhanced'' form of
commonwealth with more autonomy.
   The issue of political status is an emotional one on this U.S.
commonwealth of 3.3 million people. It has virtually dominated
politics since the island was ceded by Spain in 1898 after the
Spanish-American War.
   The 1991 referendum would be the first vote in more than 20
years on the island's status. In a 1967 referendum, 60 percent
voted to continue as a commonwealth, 39 percent favored statehood,
and 1 percent backed independence.
   Under commonwealth status, Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens
eligible for military service, food stamps and other benefits. But
they don't pay taxes or vote for president.
   The hearings by the House Insular and International Affairs
Subcommittee are chaired by U.S. Virgin Islands congressional
delegate, Ron de Lugo.
   The hearings are aimed at determining how much each option would
cost the U.S. Treasury, whether the vote should be automatically
binding, and whether a simple majority should be enough to adopt a
given option.

   Federal regulators sold a failed Texas savings
institution Friday to a holding company controlled by financier
Ronald O. Perelman in a deal that will cost the government $890
million.
   The buyer is putting up $10 million.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., created in August to dispose of
failed thrifts, sold San Antonio Savings Savings Association to
First Gibraltar Holdings Inc.
   The holding company already owns First Gibraltar Bank, a
Dallas-based S&amp;L with assets of over $9 billion. It was formed in
1988 from five smaller insolvent S&amp;Ls in a much criticized bailout
deal that required $5.1 billion in federal assistance and favorable
tax breaks.
   The name of the San Antonio S&amp;L will be changed to First
Gibraltar Bank, but it will be maintained as a separate financial
institution. Earlier this week, the Resolution Trust Corp. board
voted to allow thrifts created in earlier bailouts to bid for newly
failed S&amp;Ls.
   However, because Congress has ordered the corporation to review
the old bailouts, the agency is requiring First Gibralatar Holdings
to maintain the San Antonio institution as a separately capitalized
entity.
   The corporation said First Gibraltar's proposal was the cheapest
of seven received. The holding company is taking $1.1 billion of
San Antonio's $2.3 billion in assets. It agreed to assume
responsibility for deposits of $2 billion in 220,000 accounts and
other liabilities of $750 million. It is putting up $10 million of
its own money.
   In return, the corporation agreed to advance $1.6 billion to
First Gibraltar. The agency is keeping about $1.1 billion in sour
loans. After those are sold, the net expense to the government will
total an estimated $890 million.
   An investor group, MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings Inc., controls
First Gibralatar Holdings. Its investors include Perelman and
Revlon Inc.
   Dallas newspapers reported earlier this week that Perelman's
group had emerged as the winner of a bidding war. Others reportedly
interested in the San Antonio S&amp;L were NCNB Texas, Banc One Corp.
of Columbus, Ohio, and Security Pacific Corp. of Los Angeles.
   Analysts say the deal is a good one for First Gibraltar,
expanding its retail base from Dallas to both Houston and San
Antonio.
   It is the second big S&amp;L bailout in Texas this year. Last month,
the RTC pledged $1.1 billion in the sale of Bright Banc Savings
Association of Dallas to Banc One Corp. of Columbus Ohio.
   The Resolution Trust Corp. has taken over more than 390 S&amp;Ls,
disposing of 51 mostly small institutions.
   In another action Friday, the agency moved to protect itself
against the claims of creditors of CenTrust Bank, Miami. CenTrust,
with $8.9 billion in assets, was seized by the government on Feb.
2. It was placed into receivership on Friday.
   Receiverships also were established for Hiawatha Savings and
Loan Association of Hiawatha, Kan., and Westport Savings Bank of
Hanford, Calif.
   In other S&amp;L developments Friday:
   _The Treasury Department-led RTC Oversight Board, which controls
the policy and pursestrings of the bailout, approved a change
designed to speed the sale of repossessed real estate. It
authorized the corporation to accept down payments as low as 15
percent, a reduction from 25 percent.
   _The Federal Housing Finance Board announced it had allowed the
first two commercial banks to join the Federal Home Loan Bank
System. Membership in the system, created in 1934 to provide
low-cost financing for home mortgages, had previously been
restricted to savings institutions.
   The S&amp;L law enacted last August allows banks and credit unions
to join if they devote at least 10 percent of their assets to
residential housing. The two new members are the National Bank of
Bremerton, Bremerton, Wash., and North American Bank and Trust Co.,
Waterbury, Conn.
   _The Bush administration filled out its S&amp;L bureaucracy. It
appointed Frank G. Zarb, chairman of Smith Barney, a New York
brokerage firm, as chairman of a national advisory board overseeing
the RTC's real estate sales. Six five-member regional advisory
boards were created with headquarters in New York, Atlanta, Kansas
City, Dallas, Denver and Los Angeles. The national board will
consist of the regional chairmen and Zarb.

<DATELINE>PLOVDIV, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delegates from dozens of independent
groups opened a three-day conference Friday to unite Bulgaria's
non-Communist opposition prior to multiparty elections in June.
   As the meeting began in Plovdiv, the country's second largest
city, about 150,000 people demonstrated in the capital, Sofia, for
a free press, the state media reported.
   The Sofia rally was called by the Union of Democratic Forces, or
UDF, the leading opposition alliance, and by editors of several
recently formed independent publications.
   Speakers called for a larger distribution of newsprint to
opposition publications and no limit on subscriptions, the state
BTA news agency and state-run television reported.
   The Plovdiv gathering is the first such opposition conference.
Its main purpose is to seek ways to mount a common front to
challenge the Communists in the elections by uniting the UDF; a
recently formed Political Opposition Bloc, and other independent
parties.
   But the going will apparently not be easy. Some delegates
suggested that the UDF leadership shun groups organized along
ethnic or religious lines.
   Petko Simeonov, a senior leader in UDF, said his group now
includes 15 parties and political groups and four other parties are
about to join.
   ``The UDF has always been in favor of united actions of the
opposition,'' Simeonov told delegates. ``We want to know who the
other political parties are who in the future want to establish a
common program with us and a common list of candidates.''
   The UDF is the only opposition alliance involved in talks with
the ruling Communists.
   The Communists began the talks and other reforms after Todor
Zhivkov, the longtime, hard-line Communist leader, was ousted in
November during mass demonstrations.
   Representatives of Bulgaria's more than 1.2 million Turks and
other Moslems were not invited to the Plovdiv meeting, nor was an
organization representing the country's 800,000 Gypsies.
   The local Christian Democratic Party, a member of the Political
Opposition Bloc, was acting as host in Plovdiv, about 100 miles
southeast of Sofia.
   A total of 23 political parties and groups made brief political
statements outlining their programs. Their memberships were said to
range from 600 to more than 200,000.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Fernando Collor de Mello
on Friday named as his minister of agriculture Gov. Joaquim Roriz
of the capital district, who immediately pledged more agrarian
reform.
   The issue has often caused bloody clashes and divided this vast
nation of 150 million people. Half the arable land is in the hands
of 4 percent of the population, according to government figures.
   In another appointment, Brazil's top police officer, Romeu Tuma,
was picked to monitor tax collecting and prices. The incoming
president says he wants to wage war on the ``abuses of the elites.''
   Economist-rancher Roriz, 53, was named as minister of
agriculture and agrarian reform Friday at a news conference in the
capital, Brasilia.
   Roriz, named governor of the federal district of Brasilia in
1988 by President Jose Sarney, had planned to run for re-election
behind a swell of popular support.
   Collor de Mello, who takes office on Nov. 15 for a five-year
term, said Roriz had been instructed to start ``an agricultural
revolution in the country.'' He gave no details.
   The future minister said ``only a peaceful, social and fair
agrarian reform'' would bring about such a revolution, but he also
was not specific.
   Collor de Mello is a conservative who ran as a free-market
advocate, but he also claimed to champion the causes of Brazil's
masses.
   In 1985, Sarney promised to distribute 90 million acres of land
among 1.4 million families before 1989. He said 5.7 million
families would be relocated by the year 2000.
   But only about 20,000 families have received land, while
government statistics show 12 million farmers live in poverty.
   The president-elect named Tuma to take over the Federal Income
bureau _ Brazil's equivalent of the Internal Revenue Service _ and
the Supply and Prices Superintendency. He also will continue as
chief of federal police.
   Tuma, 58, immediately declared, ``From now on, corruption and
tax evasion are problems for the police.''
   He began his career in 1953 as an investigator for the
``political police.'' The secret service investigated leftists and
political opponents of the right-wing military regime, which ruled
from 1964 to 1985.
   As director of the Sao Paulo state political police, Tuma
received world acclaim in 1985 for discovering and identifying the
remains of Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele.
   Tuma is the only top-level member of Sarney's administration who
will keep his post under Collor de Mello.

   The motorman who operated a subway train
during a fatal derailment this week tested positive for cocaine,
and federal investigators Friday found problems with other cars
that run the same underground line.
   John K. Lauber of the National Transportation Safety Board said
urine tests uncovered traces of cocaine in the motorman's system.
Louis Gambaccini, general manager of the Southeastern Pennsylvania
Transportation Authority, said the motorman would be suspended as
of Monday.
   No other details about the employee, including his name, were
released.
   Investigators believe a motor under a subway car became
dislodged Wednesday, hitting a switch and sending half the six-car
train onto a second set of tracks. The fourth car smashed into
steel support beams, killing three passengers and trapping
survivors.
   Of 94 injured, 10 were still hospitalized Friday, all in good or
satisfactory condition, hospital officials said.
   A 37-block stretch of the subway and elevated train line
remained closed Friday, with buses ferrying passengers through west
Philadelphia. Service was expected to resume Monday.
   In another development, Lauber said inspectors examined 76
motors on 19 cars. They found 27 pins installed incorrectly in nuts
that help hold the motors under the cars.
   SEPTA has agreed to thoroughly inspect all cars running the
line, Lauber said.
   The motor that became partially dislodged and was dragged along
the subway tracks shortly before Wednesday's crash should have been
attached to the car by a long vertical bolt, held on by a nut with
a cotter pin inserted through the bolt and nut.
   A horizontal bolt and safety bracket would have been a backup in
case the vertical bolt came loose. But the safety bracket, two
thick steel loops that normally hold a horizontal bolt, had worn
through in two places.
   In addition, the nut and cotter pin holding the vertical bolt
onto the car apparently were lost before the crash, Lauber said.
   The safety bracket tore loose and the motor fell, he said. The
motor gouged a 1,500-foot section of railroad ties before hitting
the crossover switch and jerking the last three cars to a second
set of tracks, Lauber said.
   The fourth car was peeled open and nearly cut in half by steel
support beams. Seven people were trapped, including the three who
died.
   NTSB investigators had been told of at least three times _ once
during the past six months, once from 1980 to 1982 and once in 1975
_ when motors broke loose, Lauber said.
   But investigators did not know whether those motors had fallen
to the tracks, NTSB spokesman Alan Pollock said Friday. ``We're
trying to get the exact details,'' he said.
   Erich Vogel, chief mechanical officer for SEPTA, confirmed that
bolts had come loose previously, but he believed the motors always
had been caught by the safety brackets.
   ``I've been here since 1985 and we haven't lost a motor that I
know of,'' he said.
   The cars are inspected visually once a month and more thoroughly
every 12,000 miles, or about four to five months, Vogel said. Each
car also has an annual inspection, the most thorough of the three
types, he said.

<TEXT>
   Jack Lindsay, a prolific Australian
man of letters and lifelong Marxist, died at his home in the
English university city of Cambridge. He was 89.
   Lindsay, who had written, edited or translated more than 170
books, died Thursday, according to his family.
   ``He died peacefully of old age after a good, long life,'' his
Dutch wife, Meta, told The Associated Press on Friday.
   Lindsay came to England in 1926 and never returned to his
homeland. But his reputation during self-imposed exile flourished
in Australia, where he was given the title of Officer of the Order
of Australia in 1981.
   His book that year, ``The Crisis of Marxism,'' was an often
agonized analysis of failures he perceived in contemporary Marxist
philosophy.
   Lindsay's works included novels, plays and poetry, literary
criticism, history and biographies of historical figures, writers
and artists, as well as translations of classical writers.
   Mrs. Lindsay said her husband liked best his biography of the
English painter, J.M.W. Turner.
   An obituary in The Times of London described Lindsay as ``an
immensely learned man.'' It said his socialist beliefs deprived his
work of ``the serious attention it deserves.''
   Lindsay was born in Melbourne in 1900 into a literary and
artistic family. He tried to start a literary movement in Sydney
but then emigrated to London. There, he founded the Fanfrolico
Press, which published classical translations.
   More than 1 million copies of his novels of British life were
published in translation in the Soviet Union. He was given the
Soviet Order of Merit in 1968.
   Lindsay was active in socialist politics in the 1930s and served
in the Signal Corps and at the War Office during World War II. His
four volumes of autobiography contain accounts of literary life in
Australia, England and France.
   He married twice. He had a son and daughter with his second
wife, Meta Waterdrinker, who he met at a peace conference in the
Netherlands and married in 1958. Their children, Philip and Helen,
survive.
   There will be a private family funeral in Cambridge on Wednesday.

<HEAD>Death Sentence in Murder Case Linked to Mail Bombings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man was sentenced to die Friday for the shotgun
slaying of a woman whose death was cited in a letter claiming
responsibility for a series of fatal mail bombings in the South.
   A state jury deliberated about 4{ hours before sentencing
Emmanuel Hammond to die in the electric chair for the 1988 murder
of Julie Love, a 27-year-old preschool fitness instructor.
   Hammond, 24, was convicted by the same jury Wednesday of murder,
kidnapping and armed robbery.
   Superior Court Judge Ralph Hicks sentenced Hammond to life in
prison on the armed robbery count and 20 years for kidnapping.
   Miss Love, 27, of Atlanta disappeared in July 1988 and was the
subject of a much-publicized search until her body was found in a
northeast Atlanta wooded dumping ground last August. She had been
shot in the head with a shotgun.
   Hammond denied on the witness stand that he had killed Miss Love.
   The trial was held under heavy security, in part because of a
letter claiming responsibility for four mail bombings in the South
in December. Two of the bombs killed 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals Judge Robert Vance and Savannah lawyer Robert Robinson.
   The letter, signed by ``Americans for a Competent Federal
Judicial System,'' expressed outrage over the killing of Miss Love
and threatened violence if other white women were attacked by black
men in Alabama, Florida or Georgia. Miss Love was white. Hammond is
black.
   Hammond's co-defendant and cousin, W. Maurice Porter, has
pleaded guilty to murder, armed robbery and rape in Miss Love's
killing. He has yet to be sentenced.

   Oliver North says he lied repeatedly to
Congress after national security adviser John Poindexter told him
to ``take care of'' inquiries into whether he was secretly
assisting the Nicaraguan rebels.
   But ``nobody ever told me to lie to Congress,'' North testified
Friday at Poindexter's trial, insisting that he decided on his own
to make the false statements after his boss sent him to meet with
House Intelligence Committee members on Aug. 6, 1986.
   Poindexter watched intently while North spent the day on the
witness stand in U.S. District Court, reluctantly testifying
against his former boss on the National Security Council staff.
North, the government's first witness, returns Monday to face
questioning about the Iran initiative.
   Iran-Contra prosecutor Dan Webb led North through his
recollections of a conversation with Poindexter, in which North
said he didn't think it would be a ``very good idea'' to meet with
the congressmen.

   Georgia has become the fourth Soviet republic
condemning its annexation to the Soviet Union, calling the move
``an international crime'' and demanding talks to secure
independence, a local news agency reported.
   The decision Friday by Georgia's lawmakers came on the eve of a
Lithuanian parliamentary session expected to consider secession.
   Lithuania would be the first of the Soviet Union's 15 republics
to declare independence and would confront President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev in one of his gravest crises during his 5-year-old rule.
The Soviet Parliament is to vote Monday on his proposal to increase
presidential power over unruly republics.
   All three Baltic republics _ Latvia and Estonia as well as
Lithuania _ have condemned Soviet annexation of their lands a half
century ago and have strong pro-independence movements.

   The state House approved a bill that would
outlaw abortion as a method of birth control and provide the
nation's strongest challenge to a 1973 Supreme Court ruling
legalizing abortion.
   ``We're really excited,'' Nancy Myers, a spokeswoman for
National Right to Life Committee in Washington, D.C., said after
Friday's 47-36 vote. ``We consider it to be extremely significant.''
   The measure was forwarded to the Senate after more than three
hours of debate before a gallery packed with activists from both
sides of the issue.
   The bill could come to a final Senate floor vote as early as
Friday, and opponents said it stood a good chance of passing. The
GOP controls both houses of the Legislature.
   The bill, like legislation rejected recently in Minnesota and
Utah, would outlaw abortion as a method of birth control. It would
allow abortions only in cases of rape, incest, ``profound and
irremediable'' fetal disabilities, or to save the life or prevent
``severe and long-lasting physical health damage'' to the mother.

   A presidential commission is trying to find
out how many people changed travel plans when the U.S. Embassy in
Moscow disseminated a terrorism warning before the 1988 bombing of
Pan American Flight 103.
   Two embassy witnesses testified under oath Friday that a notice
from the Federal Aviation Administration of bomb threats against
Pan Am flights en route to the United States was posted in several
places around the diplomatic compound and outside and also was sent
to Soviet officials.
   The State Department previously acknowledged only that the
notice was improperly posted in the embassy a week before Flight
103 blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people on Dec.
21, 1988.
   Officials said the posting violated a policy against notifying
government personnel when others are not told of a threat.

   ``American troops will be entering a quagmire more complex than
Vietnam,'' said Kevin Zeese, vice president of the Drug Policy
Foundation, a Washington think tank that emphasizes the economic
and social issues behind the drug problem.
   Zeese commented after the Defense Department announced Friday
that it was adding warships, aircraft, radar equipment, dog teams
and other military resources in the Atlantic, Pacific, Caribbean
and along the southern U.S. border.
   The plan greatly extends the military's involvement in efforts
to stem the flow of drugs into the United States and to help
Colombia, Bolivia and other Latin American countries combat their
drug cartels on land, sea and in the air.

   The United States risks losing its
international partners in the manned space station project if
Congress cuts back on the $2.6 billion requested for the project in
1991, NASA Administrator Richard H. Truly says.
   ``I think a major reduction would cause them to look very
seriously at our commitment to the project,'' Truly told the Senate
science, technology and space subcommittee Friday.
   The space station Freedom is part of the Bush administration's
$15.1 billion request for space programs in fiscal 1991, which
begins Oct. 1. The project, with European, Japanese and Canadian
partners, has been called the largest international research and
development enterprise ever undertaken.
   Relations with the project partners were strained by the United
States' decision last year to delay completion of construction for
one year without consulting them.

   Pigs may not need encouragement to belly
up to the feed trough, but scientists are looking for ways to make
swine more efficient eaters.
   Researchers are trying to determine if bacteria found in the
digestive tracts of American buffalo can be implanted in pigs and
help farmers save money fattening their hogs for market.
   ``We know what it does in the test tube. We don't know yet what
happens in the animal,'' says Vincent Varel, a research
microbiologist for the government's Agricultural Research Service.
   A lot could be riding on the outcome of the tests at the
Department of Agriculture's U.S. Meat Animal Research Center at
Clay Center, Neb.
   Feed represents about half a farmer's production costs. An
efficient, low-cost method to improve the digestive process and
increase the weight gain from each pound of feed would lower farm
costs and increase the chance of operating profitably.
   The studies are of special interest in Iowa, which accounts for
one out of every four hogs raised for market in the United States.
   The livestock feed industry also is interested, and Varel says
four feed companies already have contacted him to find out how the
studies are progressing.
   Varel says the research is preliminary and that even if
successful, it would be at least five years before farmers could
apply the results to their hogs.
   The studies are focusing on a bacterium known as clostridium
longisporum, found in bison. When fed or implanted in pigs, the
bacterium stimulates production of a new, yet-to-be-named
microorganism, which previously has not been found in pigs.
   ``The new organism better degrades fiber in pigs fed corn and
soybeans. Metabolic studies will be done to determine how much
energy the pig derives from this organism. If the fiber-degrading
activity in pigs is increased, producers may be able to switch to
less expensive feeds, such as feed grains from ethanol
production,'' the Agricultural Research Service says in a synopsis
of its studies.
   Varel says researchers suspected such an organism existed in
bison because those beasts do a better job digesting a poor quality
diet than domestic cows do.
   In the test tube, researchers found the organism degrades
cellulose fiber 15 percent better than other organisms and decided,
``let's try it in the pig and see what happens there,'' Varel said
in a telephone interview.
   So far, no side effects have been found and none are suspected,
he says.
   The initial round of tests has determined the microorganism can
be established in pigs and a new test will see if it can be done
consistently.
   The next step is to compare the metabolism of pigs that have the
organism with pigs that do not. Metabolism is the process of
breaking down food into energy and waste matter.
   To find out, researchers will analyze what goes into the pig's
mouth and what comes out the other end.
   ``The object is to see if this organism is having an effect on
growth,'' he says. ``Within the next year, we will have a good idea
if we can consistently establish it and whether it has an effect on
the animals or not.''
   Eventually, scientists will want to determine if the organism
helps pigs add lean tissue or fat. Varel also says researchers will
want to know if the organism makes pigs eat less because they make
better use of what they are fed.
   ``We just don't have all the answers yet,'' he says.

<HEAD>Jane Pauley Anchors Her First post-`Today' Special</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 5th graf to CORRECT name of show to `NBC Nightly News'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC's Jane Pauley, safely away from the woes and
slipping ratings of the ``Today'' show she once co-hosted, starts
life anew in prime time Tuesday with an appropriately entitled
special: ``Changes.''
   Her own changes include anchoring a prime-time news series that
NBC once said might start this summer. However, it has no executive
producer yet and may not arrive until fall or even January, she
says.
   But she doesn't consider this the NBC News version of ``Waiting
for Godot.''
   ``I think it's very sensible,'' Pauley says of the delay. In her
view, ``Corporations don't normally behave sensibly if there is
some pressure to put something on the air. But this strikes me as a
very rational way to approach a weekly series, and I'm very pleased
with that.''
   On Saturday, Pauley, who also has been filling in for Tom Brokaw
on the ``NBC Nightly News,'' leaves for East Germany to start
another documentary on sports there. A few more documentaries lie
ahead after that.
   Tuesday's special is about three people and one couple whose
lives are in transition. Work on the first story, about Frank
Morgan, a 56-year-old acclaimed jazz saxophonist who spent much of
his life in prison, began in December.
   That was the month that Pauley, her contract extended to 1992,
bid adieu to 13 years of predawn wakeups for ``Today.'' She had
told its audience in October she was leaving and got a hug then
from her successor, Deborah Norville.
   But since January, ``Today'' hasn't exactly been hugged by
viewers, even though Pauley took pains in October to assure them
she wasn't at odds with Norville or co-host Bryant Gumbel, whom she
called her friends.
   Although NBC executives say they have no research to indicate
it, ``Today'' likely was hurt and ABC's ``Good Morning America''
helped by the turmoil preceding Pauley's decision to leave.
   Those off-camera troubles last year included the leak of
Gumbel's caustic memo criticizing staffers, notably weatherman
Willard Scott, and the decision of NBC executives, including
``Today'' vice president Dick Ebersol, to replace veteran ``Today''
news anchor John Palmer with Norville.
   Although NBC officials have said they expected a dip in
``Today'' ratings when Norville moved up from news anchor to
succeed Pauley in January, the dip now is in its third month.
   ABC's ``Good Morning America'' easily won the important February
ratings ``sweeps,'' the results used by TV stations to set their
advertising rates. It averaged a 4.5 rating, which was good news
for ABC affiliates.
   No so for NBC affiliates. ``Today,'' according to NBC's
estimate, had a 3.65 average in the sweeps _ well below the 4.6 it
had in February 1989 when it won the reveille ratings race. Each
ratings point now represents 921,000 homes.
   Pauley, who last year kept a stiff upper lip and never publicly
complained about the behind-camera woes at ``Today,'' is
sympathetic to its current ratings problems.
   ``Well, I've been there before,'' she says, harking back to a
time when she co-hosted ``Today'' with Brokaw and the Nielsen
verdict was that ``Good Morning America,'' then hosted by David
Hartman, had become No. 1.
   ``It was almost a relief when it finally happened,'' she says.
``Because from that moment on, we were able to scramble and get our
act together and come back.''
   She thinks the same thing will happen again, and that those in
charge of ``Today,'' including new executive producer Tom Capra,
will ``be able to put together something that comes on pretty
strong.''
   Pauley laughed uproariously when asked about an upcoming report
in the National Enquirer confiding that NBC, on bended knee, had
begged her to return to ``Today'' and that she has agreed to
interview guests on two of five shows each week, starting in April.
   ``Totally bogus,'' she said.
   Her own thoughts about the ``Today'' turmoil and its effect on
the show's ratings?
   ``Obviously, I can't personalize it,'' she said. ``And yet, I
think that an explanation is that there were `dislocations,' shall
we say, on the `Today' show. ... And I think that bothers people,
especially early in the morning.
   ``It's not just that `Jane is gone.' It's just that there was
too much disruption. In the morning, you want, er, regularity.''

   ABC-NBC SUMMIT REPORT, PART TWO: Former ``Today'' co-host
Barbara Walters will be taping a chat with Bryant Gumbel for
Friday's ``20-20'' on ABC. But officials of that show decline to
tell inquiring reporters _ who no doubt suspect amazing revelations
may be afoot _ when or where the taping is to be held.
   Anchorfolk interviewing each other has become commonplace. Last
month, NBC aired an interview of its late-night inquirer, Bob
Costas, with ABC's late-night interviewer, Ted Koppel of
``Nightline.'' Then, last week, Dick Cavett of NBC's cable service,
CBNC, interviewed Costas for ``The Dick Cavett Show.'' Costas,
among other things, criticized former ABC sportcaster Howard Cosell.

<DATELINE>BARAMULLA, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Both say they do not want war in
Kashmir, but India and Pakistan are preparing their armies to turn
the lush, rugged region into a battleground for the third time
since 1947.
   An estimated 240,000 Indian soldiers, supported by armor and
aircraft, are in Kashmir. A provocation or misunderstanding arising
from the Moslem insurgency in India's part of the region could send
them into action.
   India and Pakistan have fought over the mountains and valleys of
Kashmir since Britain carved the subcontinent into two nations,
along Hindu and Moslem religious lines, and granted them
independence 43 years ago.
   On the Indian side of the 41-year-old truce line, nearly 200
people have been killed since late January in battles between
Kashmiri Moslem secessionists and Indian troops.
   ``Militarily speaking, it is a near-war scenario; both sides are
ready,'' a retired Indian infantry officer in Srinagar said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The irony of the situation is
that both sides ... claim day after day that they do not want war.''
   In Baramulla, a major Indian army base and the last town before
the cease-fire line, convoys of army trucks and artillery roll
toward the frontier 25 miles away. Soldiers in battle fatigues
practice battle tactics, firing live rounds at mock targets.
   ``The military activity you see here is more or less normal,''
Chewang Phunsog, chief civilian administrator of the strategic
border districts Baramulla and Kupwara, said in an interview.
   ``I do not know if a war is on the cards, but if we are drawn
into it, the other side will not find us lacking,'' he said.
   In Islamabad, a spokesman for Pakistan's Defense Ministry said a
buildup of Indian paramilitary forces had occurred along the
frontier.
   ``We think it is primarily for internal security, but it can
always be used once it's there,'' said the spokesman, whose name
cannot be used under briefing rules.
   Indian military sources said the number of troops deployed in
Jammu-Kashmir, the only Indian state with a Moslem majority, had
grown from 150,000 a few months ago to about 240,000.
   At least three border incidents have occurred since an Indian
crackdown on Kashmiri separatists began Jan. 20.
   The most serious was Feb. 5, when about 4,000 Pakistani
civilians tried to cross the border to help their Moslem brethren.
Troopers opened fire, killing as many as 10, according to Indian
newspapers.
   ``Here was a classic case of provocation,'' said an Indian
officer in Srinagar, summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir, who also
would not let his name be used.
   ``We could have killed a thousand of them, but we did not,
because that could have escalated into a major confrontation,'' he
said. ``Today, political consideration comes first, but if we are
pushed and pushed, we may not have any option but to go flat out.''
   India and Pakistan fought their first war in 1948. It officially
ended with the declaration of a U.N.-sponsored truce in January
1949, and Kashmir has been divided since.
   In 1965, they fought a second war over Kashmir. It lasted 16
days and ended with no real gains for either side.
   Their third war, in 1971, did not concern the disputed region.
India entered the civil war between East Pakistan and West Pakistan
and helped transform East Pakistan into independent Bangladesh.
   On paper, India has a great military advantage. It has 1.36
million men in the armed forces and 240,000 in reserve, compared
with 500,000 men under arms in Pakistan.
   India has 3,150 battle tanks to Pakistan's 1,600 and 714
warplanes to Pakistan's 338. The Indian aircraft include advanced
Soviet MiG-29s and Pakistan has U.S. F-16s.
   The 35-member U.N. military observer group continues the task it
began four decades ago.
   ``Our job is to report any abnormal increase in military
activities on the border to our headquarters in New York,'' said
Capt. Idesbald van Biesebroeck of Belgium.
   The radio at the observer office in Srinagar crackles all day.
So far, the words heard most often are ``normal'' and ``peaceful.''

<HEAD>St Patrick's a Protestant, and a Catholic Too</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DOWNPATRICK, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   St. Patrick is a
Protestant, and a Catholic too, in the town where tradition says he
is buried.
   ``Things that would separate us nowadays would not separate us
from St. Patrick,'' said the Rev. T.J. Simpson, a Presbyterian who
will be preaching in the church near the grave on St. Patrick's Day.
   ``Our common ground is St. Patrick's ground,'' said Simpson,
general secretary of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland.
   Very little can be proved about Patrick's life and work, but
tradition associates him strongly with the counties of Northern
Ireland, where a cycle of sectarian violence began more than 20
years ago.
   Roman Catholics, Anglicans, Methodists and Presbyterians will
pray together on St. Patrick's Day in this placid town 20 miles
southeast of Belfast, close to the places where Patrick is believed
to have begun his mission and won his first converts.
   ``This is what people find hard to understand,'' said the Rev.
Brian Mayne, whose Anglican cathedral is host for the service. A
big slab of granite marking Patrick's grave is south of the church
tower.
   ``We take it for granted that people of all persuasions would be
involved,'' Mayne said. ``It's a recognition that Downpatrick is
Patrick.''
   Their common ground is not the legendary figure who drove the
snakes from Ireland and had more powerful magic than the Druids,
but the 5th century missionary as he describes himself in his
``Confession.''
   ``The modern Protestant evangelical would be surprised at how
modern Patrick is,'' said Brian Turner, curator of the Down Museum
a few hundred yards from the grave site.
   ``He is very biblically based. He is always quoting the Bible as
justification for what he does.''
   Turner, a Methodist, finds the Protestant in Patrick's
description of his inner turmoil while he was a captive in Ireland
and forced to herd flocks.
   ``The Lord there made me aware of my unbelief that I might at
last advert to my sins and turn wholeheartedly to the Lord my
God,'' Patrick writes in his ``Confession,'' one of the few pieces
of writing to survive from that time in Ireland.
   ``He showed concern for my weakness, and pity for my youth and
ignorance; he watched over me before I got to know him and before I
was able to distinguish good from evil.''
   In other words, Turner says, Patrick claimed he was saved by
grace, a fundamental principle of the Reformation.
   Canon Joseph P. Maguire at the Roman Catholic cathedral also is
attracted to this Patrick.
   ``St. Patrick was a humble man of great faith,'' Maguire said,
pointing to the saint's declaration that, while a captive, he
prayed a hundred times by day and as many by night.
   ``I would hope that the image of St. Patrick for this present
day is as a healer and reconciler, and as a person of prayer,'' he
said, but added: ``We have a sneaking regard _ a regard for the man
of the snakes and shamrocks.''
   A few years ago, Maguire became the first Roman Catholic to
preach in the Anglican cathedral since the Reformation.
   Despite all the clerical talk of ecumenism, the visitor may get
a strong feeling of division.
   Two miles away in Saul, the traditional site of Patrick's
landing in 432, there are an Anglican church at an old monastic
site and a large statue of St. Patrick atop a nearby hill
appropriated by the Catholics.
   Both were erected in 1932 for the 1,500th anniversary of
Patrick's arrival.
   ``People come to Downpatrick and they say, `When did St. Patrick
become a Protestant?''' Maguire said, and related an old joke that
``St. Patrick became a Protestant in 1932.''
   Mayne winced at hearing that gibe repeated, and insisted, ``The
Church of Ireland has always celebrated St. Patrick.''
   Simpson grew up in Ballymena, near Mount Slemish, where St.
Patrick is said to have been a herdsman. ``I, as a child, was very
close to all that,'' he said.
   Turner thinks Downpatrick is untypical in its regard for
Patrick. In Armagh, the seat supposedly chosen by Patrick, there
are no plans for ecumenical services on the 17th.
   There will be the usual parade in Dublin, which is cheerfully
conceded to be a copy of the one in New York, and shamrocks will be
distributed at many Catholic church services.
   The state primary school in Downpatrick usually closes on St.
Patrick's Day, Turner said, although it is not an official holiday
and the great majority of the school's pupils are Protestants.

<HEAD>GOP's New `Big Tent' Welcomes Pro-Choice Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pro-choice training film at a recent
candidate workshop was most notable for its audience and its star.
   The candidates were Republicans getting a pro-choice message
from one of their own, GOP Rep. Connie Morella of Maryland.
   She's still at odds with her president and her party's platform
on abortion. But in the new GOP, a GOP that says it is scrapping
litmus tests in favor of a ``big tent'' that takes in many views,
Morella no longer is a dissident. She's a role model for
like-minded Republicans.
   ``We're proof that there can be differences of opinion,''
Morella says.
   The GOP never was as single-minded as its platform suggests.
Plenty of its members have long supported abortion rights, for
example.
   But that diversity has been widely acknowledged only since last
November, when anti-abortion Republicans lost the New Jersey and
Virginia gubernatorial elections in races where abortion was a key
issue.
   It was less than two years ago that GOP leaders turned off Rep.
Nancy Johnson's microphone when she moved to delete some
anti-abortion language from the Republican platform at a party
meeting in New Orleans.
   Johnson, R-Conn., doesn't think that would happen now.
   ``We have moved from a climate in which the party was trying to
avoid the issue to a climate in which not only is discussion seen
as inevitable, but people are beginning to re-evaluate their
positions,'' she said.
   Some Republican women in Congress attribute the party's new
openness to reawakened consciences, but others are less charitable.
   ``There is a greater desire, clearly motivated by political
expediency, to make the issue less black and white,'' says Rep.
Claudine Schneider, R-R.I., who is running for the Senate.
   Either way, the women say, the end results are the same: a
greater sensitivity to women's concerns and a possible windfall of
support for bills that are important to women voters.
   ``They don't want to get hung with being anti-woman or
anti-progress,'' says Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., another candidate
for the Senate. ``People are looking for areas that all sides can
come together on. Legislators always like finding the middle.''
   Some gestures are cosmetic, such as a recent stampede to honor
women in sports. But there also could be new support for more
substantive options, including bills to provide better child care
benefits, job-protected family leave, easier adoptions and better
nutrition and health care programs for pregnant women and children.
   Several anti-abortion lawmakers from both parties have said
they'll back a new contraceptive research bill, a shift that is
encouraging to House co-sponsors Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, and
Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., sees a willingness among some
legislators to look at family planning in a new light. ``They are
saying, wait a minute, this is not an abortion issue. This is a
preventive issue. It's about health, counseling and a support
system,'' she said.
   Some GOP women say the true test of any attitude shift will be
whether the mostly male Congress shows any urgency to pass bills
that would expand the federal child care role and require most
employers to offer unpaid leave to new parents.
   Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., sees improved prospects for the
family leave bill in light of developments in her home state, where
such a measure was approved by the legislature in a special
session. The bill had been considered dead until anti-abortion
Republican Jim Courter lost the gubernatorial election by a wide
margin.
   ``There's no doubt about the political dynamics,'' Roukema said
of the turnaround in New Jersey. ``A lot of people who were afraid
they were on the wrong side of the choice question ... reassessed
their positions and voted for the bill.''
   Roukema said she's signed up more supporters for the national
family-leave bill as a result of what happened in New Jersey, ``and
a lot of people have told me they are keeping their options open.''
   Some pro-choice GOP activists would like their allies in
Congress to press for relaxed rules on abortion itself. Among other
things, they want to restore federal funds for all Medicaid
abortions and enact a ``freedom of choice'' act that would take the
future of abortion rights out of the Supreme Court's hands.
   But many GOP women say such crusades are bound to fail.
   ``Those are the kinds of changes that legislators are leery
of,'' Martin said. ``They are looking for a different package that
could let people work together.''
   But if most Republicans are not prepared to do an about-face on
abortion, many may be ready to approach the issue in a less
confrontational way, pro-choice women say. They hope that will
improve chances for restoring federal Medicaid abortion funds for
victims of rape and incest.
   President Bush condones abortion under those circumstances and
might be persuaded to release federal Medicaid dollars if there
were strict regulations, according to Snowe and others who have met
with him on the subject.
   ``Hopefully we can soften the party's position and bring some
political benefits,'' Snowe said. ``The Republican Party is going
to be looking for ways to modify the whole issue.''

<HEAD>Life After Drexel For Junk Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The junk bond kingpin is dead _ long live the
junk bond market.
   That's the theme that has emerged in many Wall Street post
mortems of Drexel Burnham Lambert, now that a month has passed
since the dominant firm in underwriting and trading of
lower-quality bonds collapsed into bankruptcy proceedings.
   On first reaction, Drexel's demise came as a severe blow to the
junk market, by abruptly removing from the scene the chief advocate
of high-yield finance.
   Participants in the market lost their primary sponsor,
facilitator and cheerleader. Even greater, perhaps, was the
symbolic impact on the faith and trust of junk bond investors.
   Nevertheless, some observers say, the junk bond market seems
very likely to endure once the current storms have passed. Indeed,
they add, the latest developments may actually prove a boon to
fanciers of ``junk'' in its original sense _ the depressed bonds of
companies in trouble.
   ``It's likely that what we've known as the junk market in recent
years, with its emphasis on takeover bonds, is gone,'' say analysts
at IDS Financial Services Inc. in Minneapolis.
   ``But high-yield securities are a legitimate investment, and the
high-yield market will emerge from the current situation in some
form.
   ``In fact, the shakeout now occurring should remove some of the
excesses that have gone on in recent years and result in a market
that is more fundamentally sound.''
   Perhaps the greatest irony in the current picture, observers
say, is that trouble in the new sectors of the junk bond game may
well expand activity in the earliest form of junk securities.
   Before Drexel came along, the junk bond market was largely made
up of once-respectable issues that had fallen on hard times. Though
some of these offered high (and risky) yields, others held out the
promise of no current return at all, since their issuers were in
default and making no interest or dividend payments.
   Investors bought no-yield junk bonds just as they would
depressed common stocks, speculating on the chances for a
turnaround in the issuer's fortunes.
   In part because of Drexel's failure, ``we expect to see a steady
flow of new distressed securities in the coming months,'' says
George Putnam III in the current edition of the Boston-based
advisory service The Turnaround Letter.
   ``There will probably be several highly leveraged companies that
might have been able to squeak by with Drexel's help but now will
not make it.''
   This kind of fire-sale merchandise has always appealed to a
hardy breed of speculators. Historically, all you needed in this
game was one or two big scores to offset the losses from other
investments that never come back.
   But analysts caution that junk bonds of that kind have always
been, and will continue to be, a long-shot proposition suitable
only for people who can afford to absorb losses and be patient.
   Concludes IDS: ``1990 is a watershed year for the high-yield
market. A number of the sources of the market's problems will
resolve themselves this year. If investors begin to feel that deals
are being made for sound reasons and in a prudent manner, they will
return.''

<TEXT>
   Recession fears have been fading on Wall Street
lately, helping the stock market to rally. But not all investors
are happy to see those worries go.
   As spring approaches in the financial world, the U.S. economy
apparently is gathering momentum again, resuming the expansion that
has been running for nearly 7{ years.
   Analysts still have some major reservations about the state of
business activity. Interest rates are higher than many people might
wish, and corporate profits remain in a slump.
   Nevertheless, the view seems to be spreading that those
misgivings will be alleviated as the year progresses by an
increasingly healthy combination of growth and slackening inflation.
   That would presumably allow stock prices to climb substantially
even before any marked improvement in corporate finances worked its
way through to the bottom line.
   ``At this stage the United States is the only developed country
with a declining inflation rate,'' said John Connolly, an analyst
at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``While the U.S. economy is troughing,
others are peaking.
   ``Right now our fundamentals are excellent _ perhaps the best
that can be found in the world.''
   For others who look at the same picture from a less optimistic
viewpoint, the prospect of a pickup in business conjures up
memories of difficult periods for investors in recent years.
   Conceivably, they say, it could usher in a new bout of concerns
before long about possible credit-tightening by the Federal
Reserve, which has been waging a long-term campaign against
inflation whenever the economy was strong enough to permit it.
   ``I expect to see more takers for the idea that the U.S. economy
is indeed growing _ not growing rapidly enough to generate strong
profits, but growing too rapidly to effect any improvement in
inflation or interest rates,'' said Greg Smith at Prudential-Bache
Securities.
   ``I suspect the triumph of this view will create another decline
in the market, and may perhaps create a buying opportunity sometime
in the second quarter. I anticipate a relatively difficult period
marked by a paucity of brave and exciting new ideas.''
   Undaunted by such warnings, buyers took stock prices to their
highest levels since early January in the past week. The Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials climbed 22.97 to 2,683.33, on top of a
96.17-point gain the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange index of all listed common stocks
rose 1.21 to 186.18; the NASDAQ composite index for the
over-the-counter market gained 5.74 to 436.76, and the American
Stock Exchange market value index was up 5.03 at 361.15.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 157.73 million shares a day,
against 161.60 million in the previous week.
   If corporate profits were the gauge rather than overall economic
output, the U.S. economy already would have lapsed into a certified
recession.
   By most measures profits declined in the third and fourth
quarters of last year, and they are expected to show another
decline in the three-month period through the end of March.
   ``Most investors are resigned to weak earnings in the first half
of 1990,'' observed Thomas Doerflinger at PaineWebber Inc. ``The
next surprise is likely to be that earnings fail to improve much in
the second half of 1990.''
   A primary reason for this, Doerflinger argues, is the recent
rise of interest rates, which stands to act as a drag on growth and
to increase companies' interest costs at the expense of profits.
   ``Of course,'' he adds, ``rising U.S. rates partly reflect
higher rates overseas.
   ``A significant risk for U.S. corporate profits is that these
rate increases will suppress economic growth overseas. This would
eliminate one of the few remaining bright spots for the earnings of
U.S. companies.''

<HEAD>USX Throws a Small Bone to Icahn, Symbolizing Lost Might of the
Raiders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corporate raiders once used junk bonds like
kryptonite to intimidate companies with takeover forays.
   But the sagging market for junk has given potential targets a
lead shield to protect themselves, and the raiders are resorting to
other, less powerful weapons.
   The latest example came this past week when USX Corp., harried
by Carl Icahn, consented to his proposal for a non-binding
shareholder vote on whether the company should vacate the steel
business.
   Icahn, USX's largest shareholder, once could have taken much
more drastic action, ultimately a hostile takeover, backed by
billions of dollars in borrowed money provided by eager banks and
the sale of junk debt securities.
   ``This shows that raiders, without the junk market and with
banks much more conservative, are now toothless and don't have the
financing to back takeover threats,'' said Charles LaLoggia, author
of a Special Situation Report, a Rochester, N.Y.-based investment
newsletter that focuses on takeover stocks. ``It shows management
is just able to say, `Go away. No. Leave.'''
   For USX, consenting to the May 7 shareholder vote was a shrewd
move, takeover experts said, largely because the steel-and-energy
giant relinquished practically nothing while giving the appearance
of responsiveness.
   Icahn is considered to have a slight chance of winning majority
support for his proposal, which would recommend that the nation's
biggest steel company sell the steel operations because they aren't
profitable enough.
   But even if he won, the company's board isn't required to
oblige. Moreover, allowing the vote enables the board to deflect
complaints that it isn't acting in the shareholders' best interests.
   ``It's like the line in `The Godfather:' `Keep your friends
close, keep your enemies closer,''' LaLoggia said. ``It appears to
accommodate Icahn and it avoids shareholder lawsuits.''
   Others said the Icahn-USX arrangement reflects how takeover
strategists are increasingly relying on shareholder votes to gain
control of target companies because they can no longer rely on bank
credit and the junk-bond market, which has slumped badly because of
a dearth of buyers and a glut of sellers. Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., the biggest junk underwriter, collapsed a month ago.
   More than half a dozen large American corporations already are
facing proxy fights, which are efforts by minority shareholders to
put an issue to a vote at annual meetings. The objective is usually
to sack the directors and replace them with allies who will take
control or force the company's sale.
   The most prominent of these fights is an effort by Dallas
investor Harold Simmons, who owns about 19 percent Lockheed Corp.,
to replace directors up for election with a slate of his own and
nullify the aerospace giant's ``poison pill'' antitakeover defense.
   Other examples include UAL Corp., facing a proxy challenge by
Coniston Partners, a New York-based takeover investment group, and
Armstrong World Industries Inc., challenged by the Belzbergs, a
wealthy Canadian family.
   The end of easily available money for takeovers isn't the only
obstacle confronting the Icahns, Simmonses and Belzbergs who were
once much more aggressive in their tactics. Corporate management
has been strengthened by recent court decisions and a number of
state antitakeover laws.
   Many takeover strategists are particularly alarmed about a
proposed strengthening of a Pennsylvania law that could serve as a
model for other states, which would require hostile buyers to
surrender their profits from the sale of an acquired company.
   ``This bill is anti-capitalist and would set a dangerous
precedent with far-reaching consequences,'' the dean of the
takeover strategists, T. Boone Pickens, wrote recently in the
newsletter of his Washington lobby group, the United Shareholders
Association. ``With management untouchable by shareholders, no
matter how poorly it performs, there will be little incentive for
anyone to own stock.''
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _New weaknesses surfaced in American manufacturing. Domestic
automakers said U.S. car and truck sales fell nearly 8 percent in
February, the lowest showing in seven years, while Japanese
automakers strengthened their share of the market. The government
said U.S. factory orders fell 5.4 percent in January, the biggest
drop in 15 years.
   _Stocks and bonds slumped at the end of the week, hurt by
renewed fear of higher inflation. The catalyst for the drop was the
government report on February unemployment, which showed the
economy produced the most jobs in nearly two years.
   _The best-known soft-drink makers in the United States and
France attempted to inject fresh fizz into classic flops. Coca-Cola
Co. announced the test marketing of Coke II, five years after the
introduction of a marketing debacle, New Coke. Perrier, which
recalled its soda water worldwide because of benzene contamination,
announced an ambitious campaign to relaunch it with an ambitious
sales and advertising campaign.

<HEAD>Bush's New Transportation Plan Could Spur Muni Bond Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The municipal bond market could be in for a
major boost in the coming decade thanks to President Bush's new
national transportation policy.
   The policy, released this past week, calls for shifting much of
the cost of the nation's transportation system to state and local
governments. It also envisions users of the system paying for
upkeep as much as possible, and private investors taking a larger
role in the funding.
   The result, experts say, should be greater sales of tax-exempt
bonds by state and local governments, the historical way that
highways, airports, ports and transit systems are paid for.
   ``It will cause a major increase in bond issuance over the next
decade,'' predicted Peter J. Schmitt, chief operating officer of
Financial Guaranty Insurance Co., which insures municipal bonds
   Other experts are more cautious.
   ``It is the beginning of a process. It may take a couple of
years before you begin to see specific results from it,'' said
Austin Koenen, chairman of the Public Securities Association, a
trade group for companies that underwrite municipal bonds.
   For years, many groups, including the PSA, have been saying the
nation's infrastructure _ roads, rails, airports and waterways _
needs a major upgrading. Koenen said Bush's plan is a recognition
of this concern.
   The Bush policy outlines new ways for state and local
governments to raise funds for transportation, such as airport
passenger taxes and tolls on roads built with federal funds _ both
of which are now prohibited.
   Koenen said this means the policy should favor the use of
municipal revenue bonds, rather than general obligation bonds.
General obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing authority
of a government, while revenue bonds are tied to a specific revenue
source linked to the project to be funded, such as tolls charged
for use of a highway built with bonds.
   Another reason revenue bonds should be more popular than general
obligation bonds is that raising taxes is a political pitfall for
most state and local governments. Legislatures and voters are much
more willing to approve bond issues if they are paid off by a fee
tied to the project funded, instead of by a general tax on all
residents.
   While the Bush plan is encouraging, the PSA said it will
continue to press for easing of tax-code rules that it contends
hinder the issuance of municipal bonds.
   Schmitt said the plan appears to favor increased use of
public-private partnerships in funding transportation. But those
partnerships were reined in by the 1986 code revision.
   ``You can't have it both ways,'' he said.
   The 1986 tax revision reduced the percentage of revenue from a
municipal bond issue that may benefit private interests from 25
percent to 10 percent. The revision also put caps on each state on
the amount of tax-exempt bond funding they may issue for private
uses.
   The change was made in response to what was perceived to be
abuse of the tax-exempt fund-raising ability of local governments
for the benefit of private companies.
   But Bob Brown, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
said the restriction should be eased for transportation projects,
since transportation traditionally is a function of government.
   While the Bush policy statement appears to promote municipal
bonds, Brown said it is more important as a recognition of the
needs of the nation's transportation system.
   ``The real thing that drives the municipal market is not so much
federal policy as the need for infrastructure,'' he said. ``What
will have a much greater effect over the next five years is how
people begin to look at infrastructure needs. Do they see that as a
top priority to address at all levels of government?''

<HEAD>National Lampoon Pitches New Image at Spring Break</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When things seemed darkest for the fraternity
brothers in National Lampoon's movie ``Animal House,'' they staged
a wild Roman toga party.
   Life sometimes imitates art. With circulation down and
publication schedules scaled back at the 20-year-old humor and
satire magazine, National Lampoon executives decided it was time to
let loose.
   This month, National Lampoon is spending $500,000 to promote a
revamped look to the college spring break crowd in Daytona Beach.
The campaign will include billboards, sports contests, bikini
competitions and, of course, a toga bash.
   ``We're going to the college students and saying, `Take a look
at our magazine. We think you'll like it,''' said Michael Carr, a
former advertising director at Playboy hired last year as publisher
of New York-based National Lampoon.
   The April issue already shows the new direction of the magazine,
which built its reputation in the 1970s on locker room-level
guffaws and a sardonic eye.
   For the first time in many years, there is no nudity in the
magazine. But it still contains many male-oriented sex jokes, a
National Lampoon staple.
   Plans include improved graphics, more short fiction, articles on
comedians and humor and an emphasis on listings and tips. ``We want
to make it a guidebook to your funny bone,'' said Carr.
   Carr said none of the spring break promotions will feature
alcohol, which showers most other activities for the estimated
400,000 college students expected in Daytona Beach this year.
   ``The days of the Fort Lauderdale-party-till-you-puke mentality
is gone,'' said Carr. ``We want the kids to go home with good
memories of spring break.''
   ``Spring break is a marketing paradise,'' said James Spanfeller,
associate publisher of Playboy magazine, which was launching its
own three-week Daytona Beach promotions.
   The 1980s was a boom-time for comedy clubs and films, but the
yuppie era was tough for National Lampoon, an outgrowth of The
Harvard Lampoon in Cambridge, Mass.
   Circulation, which peaked at nearly 850,000 in 1974, fell to
230,000 before a slight rebound last year. In 1986, the magazine
started publishing every two months, but Carr said monthly
publication will resume with the 20th anniversary issue in October.
   Media analysts say part of the magazine's decline stemmed from
its failure to keep pace with the growing sophistication and
changing tastes of its readership _ defined by Carr as 80 percent
male, about 28 years old, college-educated and earning $36,000 a
year.
   ``A magazine must continually invigorate to bring in a new
audience,'' said Hollywood, Calif-based producer Daniel Grodnik,
who purchased National Lampoon Inc. last year. His partner in the
venture is actor Tim Matheson, who played the character Otter in
``Animal House.''
   On Friday, Grodnik and Matheson announced they had agreed to
sell the company to J2, a home-video producer and distributor, in
an exchange of stock valued at $4.67 million. Both will continue to
run the company as a division of J2, which will provide additional
capital for the magazine.
   The two investors hired Carr, several new writers and Billy
Kimball, who edited The Harvard Lampoon's 1981 parody of People
magazine.
   Carr says advertisers already have begun to respond to the
shake-up. In its February issue, the 112-page National Lampoon had
six pages of advertising. The 96-page April issue, which sells for
$3.95, has 40 pages of ads, including big-budget companies such as
Molson Beer, R.J. Reynolds and Playboy.
   In 1988, the most recent financial reports available, National
Lampoon Inc. reported revenue of about $5 million, slightly down
from 1987. But the report does not include the third of National
Lampoon's ``vacation'' films, ``Christmas Vacation,'' which grossed
more than $75 million at the box office following its late 1989
release.
   ``If the Lampoon will tone itself down and have that
sophisticated look and content to match, advertisers will put their
label on it,'' said Paul DuCharme, head of print advertising at
Grey Advertising.
   But analysts note that other publications are competing for the
chuckles of U.S. readers.
   Four-year-old Spy magazine, which often satirizes modern urban
culture, announced last month it is seeking either a buyer or
cash-rich investors for expansion. Time Warner Inc.'s 38-year-old
Mad magazine focuses on a school-age crowd and reports a growing
circulation of about 1.4 million worldwide.
   Problems, however, may loom for publications that cater to a
mostly male readership, said David Orlow, chairman of Periodical
Studies Service Inc. in New York.
   ``That usually means a lot of cigarette and alcohol ads,'' he
said. ``The way things are going with public attitudes, it appears
that type of advertising is on the decline.''

<HEAD>Digital To Expand Voluntary Severance Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp. said Friday it will cut
thousands of employees from its payroll by expanding a voluntary
severance program as it contends with a slumping U.S. computer
market.
   Digital officials would not give specific figures on how many
jobs would be eliminated, saying the plan was under preparation.
But Brad Allen, manager of shareholder relations, said the number
was ``in the ballpark'' of previous estimates by industry analysts.
   Analysts have said Digital, which employs about 125,900 people
worldwide and more than 70,000 in the United States, wants to pare
its payroll by at least 5,000 and eventually redeploy as many as
15,000 employees in new jobs.
   ``The momentum has picked up, the program definitely will be
expanded,'' Allen said, adding the program was to be implemented by
the end of the company's fiscal year on June 30.
   Digital spokeswoman Nikki Richardson said the severance program
will be similar to a package offered last year to 700 employees at
the company's manufacturing plant in Salem, N.H.
   Under that volunteer plan, which has been accepted by 260
workers so far, employees received a cash payment based on years of
service, as well as medical, dental and life insurance coverage for
one year.
   Workers with up to two years of service, for example, received
40 weeks of pay. Those with three to 10 years got 40 weeks, plus
three weeks for each year between three and 10 years.
   ``We are looking at all transition programs on a
business-by-business basis,'' Richardson said.
   Digital, the world's second-largest computer company after
International Business Machines Corp., saw its earnings fall 39
percent for the six months ended Dec. 31.
   The company, based in suburban Maynard, blames the drop on a
lackluster computer market in the United States, which has forced
other companies to make cutbacks as well.
   Digital also has reassigned hundreds of employees from
manufacturing to sales.

<HEAD>Hunts Having Trouble Meeting Penrod Loan, May Lose Drilling
Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of banks and investors may take control of
Penrod Drilling Co. on March 31 because its owners, the Hunt
brothers, are having problems raising cash for a loan payment, a
newspaper reported Friday.
   The Dallas Morning News, quoting anonymous sources, said Penrod
may not be able to meet the first of 32 payments on $525 million
owed a group of six banks.
   Penrod was founded by the late billionaire H.L. Hunt and passed
on through trusts to his children, William Herbert Hunt, Nelson
Bunker Hunt and Lamar Hunt.
   If the Hunt brothers default on the payment, which includes $15
million in principal and about the same amount in interest, they
would lose control of their 50 percent stake in Penrod.
   Leon Crozier, who leads Penrod's land-based drilling operations,
said Friday the company had no comment on the report.
   The newspaper said control of the drilling company may
eventually wind up with Fort Worth investor Richard E. Rainwater
and his partners, including Energy Service Co.
   Rainwater's group has purchased 27 percent of Penrod's debt. The
group this week bought Penrod debt held by Bank of America,
according to a spokesman for the San Francisco-based bank.
   The Hunt family fortune has been entangled for almost a decade
in a series of lawsuits, bankruptcies and battles with the Internal
Revenue Service and various federal regulators.
   The half of Penrod owned by the Hunt brothers' personal trusts
is pledged as collateral for the drilling equipment company's
borrowing.
   In case of a default, the loan agreement calls for the brothers'
stake to pass to whoever holds the notes.
   The newspaper also said the Hunts are negotiating with the banks
to remove a claim on the future earnings of Placid Oil Co., the
Hunts' oil exploration firm, in exchange for control of Penrod. As
part of Penrod's 1988 restructuring, the banks were promised first
claim to income from the oil company's projects.
   The banks gradually have been selling their 50 percent of
Penrod's stock to contract drillers interested in acquiring
Penrod's 40 offshore drilling rigs, considered to be among the most
modern in the world.

<HEAD>Exxon Shareholders' Environment Proposals On Proxy Statement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp. shareholders and environmentalists
said Friday that their attempts to prod the giant oil company into
a more environmentally sensitive direction could include a call at
Exxon's annual meeting to oust its chairman.
   Six shareholder proposals on environmental issues have been
cleared by the Securities and Exchange Commission for inclusion in
Exxon's proxy statement and will be voted on at the company's April
25 annual meeting.
   The company opposes all six proposals, which among other things
call for Exxon to ``take leadership in dealing with (the) damage''
caused by its Alaska oil spill.
   Another resolution for an environmental report card based on the
Valdez Principles, which is a set of corporate guidelines calling
for conservation, restoration of damaged environments, reduction of
wastes and other moves to protect the environment.
   Shareholders were unable to get such measures in the proxy
statement last year because the huge oil spill in Alaska, which
created a lingering public outcry against Exxon, occurred after the
deadline for submitting resolutions.
   Instead shareholders, including some representing pension funds
with large holdings of Exxon stock, had to be content with
questioning company leaders about the spill and demanding greater
accountability.
   As occurred last year, some shareholders again are likely to ask
at the annual meeting for the resignation of Lawrence G. Rawl,
Exxon's chairman and chief executive officer, said Gray Davis,
trustee for the California Public Employee Retirement System, the
nation's largest public pension fund.
   ``I've never seen a less concerned and less tuned in CEO,'' said
Davis, who also is comptroller for the state of California. ``Maybe
it requires a new CEO to understand that America will not tolerate
this.''
   Davis said a shareholder request for Rawl to resign is
``obviously on the table and the outside directors should look
seriously at making a management change.''
   Davis said 8.24 million shares of Exxon stock owned by Calpers
will be voted in favor of at least some of the environmental
resolutions. New York City also will be tossing its 5.1 million
Exxon shares into the environmental pool, said Tim Smith, executive
director of InterFaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, which
represents 250 religious groups nationwide, some of whom own Exxon
stock.
   Together, the pension funds own less than 1 percent of Exxon's
1.3 billion outstanding shares.
   Smith, who helped draw up the Valdez Principles, said most of
the 25 companies asked to approve the principles had agreed to
submit a report describing their company's programs and progress
toward achieving the objectives.
   Mobil Corp., Texaco Inc., Chevron Corp. and Amoco Corp. have
agreed to supply a report in six months, preventing a shareholder
resolution on the matter in their proxy statements, Smith said
   Several other big companies, including Exxon, Atlantic Richfield
Co. and American Express Co., declined to provide the report card
and will have resolutions put to a vote at upcoming meetings.
   ``There has been no response from Exxon. It surprises me because
one of the things they said they are doing is this kind of
report,'' said Smith.
   Brent Blackwelder, an Exxon shareholder and vice president of
Friends of the Earth, a Washington D.C.-based environmental
organization with 50,000 members, said his group endorses the
resolutions and would support a change in Exxon management.
   Despite getting the resolutions included in Exxon's proxy,
supporters concede it is unlikely they will be adopted because
passage of shareholder proposals is rare. Nonetheless,
environmentalists hope the proposals will increase pressure on
Exxon to become more environmentally sensitive.
   ``At a minimum hopefully they will get the attention of the CEO
and the board,'' Davis said.

<HEAD>MCorp Sells Bank in Corpus Christi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>

   MCorp will sell its interest in MBank Corpus
Christi to the bank's managers, company officials said Friday. It
would be the second such transaction in less than two weeks.
   The deal, which is subject to regulatory and bankruptcy court
approvals, would leave MCorp, once the state's second-largest bank
holding company, with three subsidiaries to sell.
   A group of investors led by Jerry Gates, chairman and chief
executive officer of MBank Corpus Christi, will become the bank's
owner under an agreement with MCorp. The sale is expected to be
complete by July 31.
   The bank had assets of $582 million and deposits of $502 million
on Dec. 31, 1989.
   The bank's name will be changed to Corpus Christi National Bank,
the name under which it was originally chartered 100 years ago.
   ``Over the past few months, as events unfolded which made it
appear that local ownership of the bank was a possibility, we've
received hundreds of comments from customers and community leaders
expressing their support for the return of Corpus Christi National
Bank,'' Gates said.
   Terms of the agreement call for MCorp to receive an undisclosed
amount of assets, mostly loans and real estate, for the bank's
stock. MBank Corpus Christi will simultaneously issue $20 million
in new stock.
   MCorp, which has been in bankruptcy proceedings since March
1989, last week said it had reached an agreement to sell MBank El
Paso to its managers.
   The Dallas-based firm is trying to sell its remaining banking
subsidiaries in Brownsville, New Braunfels and Waco.
   ``We are looking to sell those assuming we can get what we view
as adequate or proper value for the benefit of our shareholders,''
said MCorp spokesman Doug Hughes.
   The five banks remained with MCorp after the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. stripped it of 20 banking subsidiaries following
the bankruptcy filing. Those 20 banks were bought by Banc One
Corp., an Ohio banking company, and now operate as Bank One-Texas.
   MCorp's federally assisted bailout was the third largest in
history after those of Continental Illinois in 1984 and First
Republic Corp. of Dallas in 1988.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Gyrate In Hectic Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIO FOX</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Coffee futures went from boiling hot on Monday, when prices went
over $1 a pound, to ice cold on Friday, when they dropped 700
points.
   Technical factors and speculation about Brazilian coffee
supplies helped trigger the late-week selloff.
   Everything looked sweet as the week began, with concern about
tight availability of high-quality coffee boosting prices on the
New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange to eight-month highs.
   Coffee futures had fallen below 70 cents a pound last year as
producers sold out their warehoused stocks, but the price moved
higher as the supply-demand situation became more balanced.
   Monday was the fourth straight day of strength for the market,
but the advances didn't have anything to do with any fresh news,
traders said.
   There was civil strife in the Ivory Coast, a shortfall in
Mexico's coffee supply, poor growing conditions in Colombia and a
lack of availability from Ecuador. But traders essentially already
known about those factors, analysts said.
   During the week, coffee prices started slipping. Then on Friday,
futures tumbled on talk that Brazil was ready to put more of its
crop on the world market.
   March's futures contract for coffee dipped to 95.18 cents a
pound, falling 732 points in ``monster volume,'' said Bert Ruiz, a
vice president of Balfour Maclaine Corp.
   The Brazilian coffee agency estimated Thursday that it had over
16 million bags on hand, Ruiz said.
   Although much of that coffee was not apparently of the finer,
exportable grade, there apparently was enough to scare traders,
many of whom were speculating coffee had been overbought earlier
this week when the near-month contract topped $1.05 a pound, Ruiz
said.
   Coffee settled 4.25 cents to 7.32 cents lower, with the contract
for delivery in March at 95.18 cents.
   Here are some other weekly commodity price trends:
   Soybeans and corn prices advanced, but wheat futures fell on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat for delivery in March settled Friday at $3.83{ a bushel,
falling from $3.88} a week earlier; March corn rose from $2.45} to
$2.43\ a bushel; oats for March advance to $1.46 a bushel from
$1.44\; and soybeans for March climbed from $5.68} to $5.87{ a
bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, livestock and meat futures
were higher.
   April cattle were 77.62 cents a pound, up from 76.25 cents;
March feeder cattle advanced from 80.47 cents to 82.10 cents a
pound; live hogs for April jumped from 50.67 cents to 51.92 cents a
pound; and frozen pork bellies in March went from 48.75 cents to
50.95 cents a pound.
   Precious metals declined on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
   March gold dropped from $403 to $399.80 a troy ounce; and March
silver fell to $5.10 a troy ounce from $5.13.
   Energy products futures sank on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Crude oil for April dipped from $21.35 to $20.43 a barrel; April
heating oil was down to 53.86 cents a gallon from 55.87 cents; and
unleaded gasoline for April was 54.99 cents a gallon, down from
56.47 cents.

<HEAD>English May Back User Fee On Futures Trades</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: This is for Saturday PMs.</NOTE>

   Rep. Glenn English says he may
reluctantly support a user fee on futures trades to fund tougher
enforcement by the industry's federal regulator, the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.
   In a speech Friday to the Futures Industry Association's annual
convention, English also criticized the Securities and Exchange
Commission's bid for jurisdiction over stock-index futures, calling
it a bureaucratic ``power grab.''
   English, D-Okla., sponsored a CFTC reauthorization bill passed
last year by the House. The bill would increase the agency's budget
by about 30 percent to $44 million over the next two years to pay
for tougher policing of the nation's futures exchanges.
   The Bush administration has proposed an 11-cent user fee on
every futures transaction to provide nearly all of the CFTC's
revenue, a plan the industry strongly opposes.
   English, who chairs a House credit subcommittee with CFTC
oversight authority, said he might support a smaller user fee to
pay only for the proposed increase in the agency's budget. The
Chicago Mercantile Exchange has said it could back such a plan.
   English said he usually opposes user fees, which he also called
taxes.
   But he said that ``given the realities of the budget we face
today, if we can find no other way to meet the funding requirements
that we have authorized in the House and Senate legislation, I
would very reluctantly accept user fees in making up that
difference.''
   A version of English's bill has been approved by the Senate
agriculture committee and a Senate vote is expected after Easter.
   User fees and jurisdictional issues are among the concerns being
addressed by Congress in the debate over CFTC reauthorization in
the wake of the 1987 stock-market crash and the federal
investigation of trading fraud at the Chicago Board of Trade and
Chicago Merc.
   On the question of regulatory jurisdiction over stock-index
futures, English said the SEC is outmoded and lacks the expertise
to effectively regulate futures markets.
   The SEC, which regulates the stock and bond markets, has been
gaining congressional support in its long-running battle for
control over index futures, which are regulated by the CFTC.
   Stock-index futures _ which are based on such indexes as the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index _ enable investors to speculate
on the stock market's general trend without actually having to buy
hundreds of different issues.
   Strategies involving the simultaneous trading of stock-index
futures and the stocks they represent _ known as index arbitrage _
has been blamed by some for causing excessive price volatility in
the stock market.
   But English said the SEC has no business in the futures markets.
   ``The Securities and Exchange Commission ... has been living on
its reputation and may in fact be archaic and old-fashioned in many
of their methods,'' English said.
   He said the recent collapse of of the junk-bond giant Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. raised ``serious questions'' about whether the
SEC ``can handle their own business, much less anyone else's.''
