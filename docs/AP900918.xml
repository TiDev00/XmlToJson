   President Bush, attacking Saddam Hussein from
the campaign trail Tuesday, said Iraq's military must not be
allowed to benefit frm any humanitarian shipments of food and
medicine intended for innocent civilians.
   He also said there is no reason the Persian Gulf crisis should
keep politicians from actively campaigning. ``I am sure every
Democrat agrees - we will not allow our political life to be held
hostage to a crisis,'' Bush said.
   Bush made his comments in GOP fund-raising events in Denver and
Los Angeles at the start of a two-day trip. On Wednesday he will
campaign in San Francisco before returning to Washington.
   ``We mean to keep the sanctions in place - to keep the pressure
on - and prove to Saddam Hussein that aggression does not pay,''
Bush said. He said Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has caused ``misery
and suffering for millions.''
   The chief beneficiaries of Bush's visits were Rep. Hank Brown,
who is trying to move up to the Colorado Senate seat being vacated
by Republican Sen. William Armstrong, and Sen. Pete Wilson, in a
close race for governor in California.
   Wilson's race is the No. 1 target for the GOP this year, and
Bush's appearances were expected to raise $2 million.
   In his speeches, Bush combined his assault against Saddam with
standard campaign appeals to Congress for action on the budget
deficit, anti-crime legislation and an overhaul of the Clean Air
Act.
   `It's time to reach a binding budget agreement that shows the
American people that we are serious about real deficit reduction,''
Bush said.
   He also called for energy conservation and development of
alternative fuel sources to curb dependence on foreign oil. ``We've
indulged a dangerous habit as a nation far too long,'' he said.
   Despite the partisan nature of his outing, Bush avoided any
direct criticism of Democrats. However, Democrats seized on the
occasion to twit Bush on allegations that his son, Neil, acted
improperly in the $1 billion failure of a Denver savings and loan.
   Dick Freese, chairman of the Colorado Democratic Party, issued a
statement challenging Bush to turn over the profits from Brown's
fund-raiser to the savings and loan bailout.
   ``Any good father knows what needs to be done,'' Freese said.
``When our boys hit a ball through a neighbor's window, we don't
make the guy next door pay to fix his own window. We get it fixed
and work with the kids to make good on it.''
   Bush did not comment in his speech on the S&amp;L scandal.
   Discussing the Persian Gulf, Bush raised the possibility that
humanitarian aid eventually may have to be sent to Iraq to offset
hardships resulting from U.N. sanctions and a blockade on Iraqi
commerce.
   ``Should aid become necessary,'' he said, ``it must be
distributed under strict international supervision, to make certain
that emergency aid reaches those Iraqis who need it most.
   ``We cannot allow Saddam Hussein to divert needed humanitarian
aid in order to sustain his army of occupation,'' the president
said.
   In a speech in Los Angeles, Bush said the gulf crisis requires
that patriotism take precedence over politics.
   ``So it's good that politics stop at the water's edge, but that
still leaves a lot of America in between,'' Bush said. ``From Long
Beach to Long Island, we should and we will vigorously campaign
right up to the November election.
   ``For those of us at home,' he added, ``we can serve our country
by being the best candidates, the best citizens and, yes, the best
Republicans and Democrats we can be.''
   Struggling to maintain a global consensus against Iraq's
aggression, Bush has kept the Persian Gulf crisis at the center of
his public appearances. While Congress and the public stand united
behind his policy, Bush has been expressing concern that the
support might fade in a prolonged desert showdown with Saddam.
   ``Never before has the world community been so united,'' Bush
said. ``Never since the invasion began has Iraq stood so isolated
and alone. The key is collective action, sharing the
responsibilities and the risks, the challenges and the costs.'' He
said more than 20 countries have forces in the gulf.
   He said that despite the gulf crisis, ``we can all see the
outlines emerging of a stronger, more peaceful world order. ...
   ``And let me be clear: With all that's at stake, the world will
not allow one dictator's aggressive ambitions to stand in the
way.''
   Flying to Denver on Air Force One, Bush signed into law a bill
allowing members of the armed forces in the Persian Gulf to send
mail to the United States without cost. The law covers the sending
of letters and recorded tapes.

   Oklahoma became the first state in the
nation to put a limit on the length of service of state legislators
by giving overwhelming approval Tuesday to a constitutional
amendment.
   The amendment, which becomes effective Jan. 1, puts a lifetime
cap of 12 years on legislative service. Legislators currently in
office will be allowed to serve 12 more years.
   With 95 percent of the precincts reporting, ``yes'' votes
outnumbered ``nos'' by 427,347 to 205,023, or 68 percent to 32
percent.
   Tulsa businessman Lloyd Noble II backed the circulation of an
initiative petition to get the issue on the ballot. He contended
that the term limitation was needed to keep legislators from
becoming entrenched in office and beholden to vested interests
instead of the people they were supposed to serve.
   Opponents argued that a remedy already was available - the
ballot box. They pointed out that only 16 members of the 48-member
state Senate and 14 of the 101 House members had 12 or more years
of service at the end of the 1990 legislative session.
   The opponents also argued that voters would be giving up some of
their rights by approving the term limitation bill. But most
observers had predicted from the outset it would pass, particularly
after the people approved another state question in 1989 that
sharply limited the time the Legislature can remain in session.
   Although state legislators elected this year will take office in
November, Noble said he believed the 12-year limit would apply to
them.
   Colorado and California will vote on term limitation proposals
Nov. 6, according to the National Council of State Legislatures.
Similar legislation has been introduced in Florida and New York,
the council said.

   EDITOR'S NTE - The drama that plays daily in criminal
courtrooms around the country is mostly tragedy, and Judge Earl
Strayhorn knows its characters and sad speeches well. Still, in
this second part of the series ``City Faces, City Fears,'' the
jurist who grew up in the inner city says he cannot let his
``sorrow and pity'' cloud the tough judgments he must make.

   It's late morning in Judge Earl Strayhorn's
chambers and today's topic is wasted lives. One young man is dead
in a shooting over drugs. Another, a 19-year-old gang member, will
pay for the crime.
   Now it's bargaining time.
   The 19-year-old's lawyer pleads for mercy. The prosecutor talks
of murder. Then the judge makes his offer: 20 years, take it or
leave it.
   Minutes later, the boyish cocaine dealer, jaw jutting, head
cocked back defiantly, pleads guilty to murder. His mother,
straining to hear in the court's front row, cups her tearful face
in her hands. As she leaves, she's comforted by a youth whose
T-shirt has a moniker on the back: ``Killer.''
   So goes another day in the Cook County courts, another day where
dreams die, where mothers cry, where the strangest and saddest
stories are told, where a few words from the honorable Earl
Strayhorn can mean life or death.
   ``Yes, this IS justice,'' the judge says of the five-minute
bargaining session he estimates saved seven trial days. ``He's not
walking away with a slap on the wrist. Twenty years ain't chopped
liver. The penitentiary is not a country club.''
   For almost 20 years, Strayhorn has judged the crimes and
misdemeanors of urban America. This tart-tongued veteran of the
nation's largest court system says he's a pragmatist, not a
dreamy-eyed crusader out to right every wrong.
   ``I am NOT society's avenging angel,'' he declares. ``I am NOT
sitting in order to act as the conscience of society and to impose
the horrible wrath of the Lord on people who commit horrible
crimes.''
   And he has heard his share: the teen who threw her baby down a
garbage chute into a compacter, the guy who axed his grandmother to
death, the man who hacked off his lover's head and toes and mailed
them.
   ``Life in this day and age is cheaper than a piece of meat in
the meat market,'' Strayhorn says. ``People will haggle over the
cost of steak more than they will consider the worth of a human
life.
   ``I cope with that. But,'' he adds slowly, ``I never get used to
it.''
   In fact, Strayhorn believes the world has turned harsher since
he first donned black robes: more vicious crimes, more drug use,
younger offenders.
   But this man who has climbed the steps of the Depression-era
criminal courts building for 42 of his 72 years, as a prosecutor,
defense attorney and now judge, decided long ago not to allow the
cruelty eat him up.
   ``I put a shield on. I don't let it get behind that shield,'' he
says, sitting in his chambers, lined with awards, memorabilia and
photos of his wife, lawyer-son, doctor-daughter and grandchild.
   Strayhorn disposes of 500 to 550 cases a year, about 60 percent
in pleas or bench trials. In 1989, 28,647 felony cases were filed
in the county's criminal division, more than triple the number of a
decade earlier, officials say. An estimated 75 percent were tied to
drugs.
   Strayhorn says being a black raised in Chicago - he now lives a
15-minute drive from work - better prepared him to be a judge: He
understands the environment and experiences of many who become
court statistics.
   But when the white-haired, bespectacled judge takes the bench in
his cavernous marble and wood courtroom, he's no soft touch.
   ``Why are you wearing that junk?'' he snaps at a bearded drug
offender whose earring he takes as a sign of gang membership.
``When you come into court, you better take it out. You're caught
with them, their dirt is going to spill over on you and I'm going
to send you to the penitentiary. Do you understand?''
   A suspected burglar fares no better. His lawyer wants his bond
reduced, arguing that he supports four children. Strayhorn asks how
much he gives the mother each week and questions his claim that a
job's waiting. The man mumbles a confused answer.
   Strayhorn interrupts, snarling at the lawyer: ``Don't make him
lie. Tell him to SHUT UP.... That's why he's here. He's a liar!''
   ``You can't put anything over on the guy,'' says Jack Murphy, a
prosecutor. ``He's seen it all. He's heard it all.''
   But Strayhorn has a lighter side, too. He teases a balding
lawyer: ``This case has got all the hair on it you lost off your
head.'' He needles another, ``You're starting off on the short end
of the stick. This one happened in my neighborhood.''
   And at a civil marriage ceremony for a jail inmate, Strayhorn
suddenly looks up from his paperwork and barks: ``Hey, man, kiss
her!''
   After a generation on the bench, Strayhorn says punishment
remains the toughest part of the job.
   He has imposed the death penalty twice, though he morally
opposes it, and once sentenced a gang rapist to 125 years,
prompting the man to retort: ``I hope you croak in bed tonight.''
   But he also acknowledges he probably gives more probation than
other judges - in about 85 percent of his cases.
   ``My probation is harder to do than doing time,'' he argues.
``You have to use some self-discipline. ...That's punishment,
particularly when they know what they've got hanging over their
head is a big sword.
   ``If I send this malleable kid down to the penitentiary, all
he's going to learn down there is how to be a bigger, worse
crook,'' he adds.
   When ordering probation, Strayhorn always tells criminals what
their prison sentences will be if they violate it. He gives no
second chances.
   ``I'm arrogant,'' he says. ``I have confidence in myself. I feel
I'm better than most and as good as the best.''
   Still, he says, ``not a day goes by that I don't remember that I
am black and being a judge really hasn't changed that.''
   It becomes a theme when he speaks to groups of young people.
   ``When does a black person become a nigger in our society?'' he
says he asks such groups. ``And their eyes widen and then somebody
says, `I don't know, when?' I say, `When you leave the room.' ''
   ``The moral of the story ... I know I'm good, but I'm still
black. That means I'm not going to receive the benefit of being
good merely because I have been good. I'm going to have to be
something more.''
   Strayhorn says he knows racism and other urban ills often are
factors in crimes. That doesn't sway him.
   ``All I can do is put a Band-Aid on the cancer,'' he says. ``If
I allow my sorrow and my pity and my understanding that there is an
explainable reason this person is just a step above an animal, if I
allow the feeling to outweigh my judgment, I'm not going to be a
good judge.''

   Drug cases have clogged urban courts, delayed
civil matters, overcrowded jails and stirred new debate over the
best possible solution - legalization or more judges.
   ``If you want to look at the largest single cause of caseload
glut, drugs are it,'' said Albert Alschuler, professor at the
University of Chicago Law School. ``We're having fewer and fewer
trials, particularly on the civil side. No one can afford to wait.
The system's just become unworkable.''
   Much of the impact is on state courts, which process about 97
percent of drug arrests. But the federal system also is feeling the
crunch. Consider:
   - Drug cases in federal courts increased by 280 percent since
1980, Chief Justice William Rehnquist said last December in his
annual end-of-the-year report. He urged Congress to act immediately
on a proposal to create new judgeships.
   In July, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved a measure to
create 77 new judgeships. The bill is pending in the Senate.
   - Federal drug cases represented more than 26 percent of new
criminal filings, and up to 60 percent in some districts, Rehnquist
said. Nearly 55 percent of criminal appeals involved drug offenses,
compared with 30 percent in 1980.
   - The drug caseload rose by 56 percent in 17 big-city courts
between 1983 and 1987, according to a 1989 report, ``The Impact of
Drug Cases on Case Processing in Urban Trial Courts.'' Among the
major increases: Boston - 175 percent; Jersey City, N.J. - 114
percent; the Bronx borough of New York City - 109 percent; and
Oakland, Calif. - 95 percent.
   - Drug-related cases made up about a quarter of felonies
disposed of in 26 big-city courts in 1987, the report said. It
noted that number actuallyis low because it doesn't count
incidents in which drugs were involved but didn't constitute the
most serious charge.
   The situation has turned even grimmer since then; in Detroit,
the percentage of state court drug cases more than doubled from
1987 to 1989, said John Goerdt, the report's co-author and senior
staff attorney at the National Center for State Courts.
   Drug cases, he added, are ``starting to show up in family
courts, in juvenile courts, with abused and neglected kids.''
   When courts are stressed, ``nobody can render the same quality
of justice,'' said James Fyfe, a criminal justice professor at
American University in Washington, D.C. ``We all know the old saw
that justice delayed is justice denied. ... Evidence disappears.
Recollections grow dimmer.''
   Complicating matters, experts say, are new mandatory sentencing
laws, leading some defendants to seek trial rather than pleading
guilty, adding to the backlog.
   In Goerdt's report, jury trials in the 26 big-city courts
disposed of only 6 percent of all felonies in 1987.
   While some propose more staff, U.S. District Judge Robert W.
Sweet in New York last year became the first federal judge to
publicly advocate drug legalization. The burden is so great, he
said, that in September 1989, no federal juries in Manhattan were
available to hear civil trials.
   Others who have previously supported legalization include
Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke and conservative columnist William F.
Buckley.
   Regardless of different proposals, experts agree the impact is
enormous.
   ``The taxpayers are spending lots of money to warehouse people
in jail,'' Alschuler said. ``(Inmates) are sleeping on floors on
mattresses. ... Everybody in the system suffers.''

   Bush administration and congressional budget
negotiators were an impasse late Monday after both sides made new
offers that still left them far apart in the area of new taxes and
with important disagreements over spending cuts.
   Congressional leaders of both parties and top administration
aides planned to abandon the talks at nearby Andrews Air Force Base
and, instead, were scheduled to meet at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday
in an attempt to get the discussions going again.
   Bargainers said they were not giving up hope that a
deficit-cutting deal could ultimately be reached, but they
expressed uncertainty over how that could be done.
   ``It's not quite an impasse, but its pretty close to one,'' said
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan. ``After 10 grueling days,
there are still major differences on dozens of issues, all the way
from A for agriculture to Z for enterprise zones.''
   ``It's going to be tough, but it's still not impossible and no
one is giving up,'' Dole continued. ``The problem is we're running
out of time.''
   Asked if the talks had collapsed, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
another negotiator, said, ``No, but at this point we've reached an
impasse. We're apart on every major area.''
   A Democratic official involved in the talks, speaking on
condition of anonymity, declined to call the bargaining at an
impasse. He said the only remaining areas of discord was over
President Bush's insistence that the package include a cut in the
capital gains tax.
   The lawmakers and administration officials had met for the last
10 days at Andrews in hopes the isolation from Capitol Hill might
help them reach an agreement on ways to ease the deficit.
   Bush earlier Monday called on the bargainers to complete a
deficit-reduction package, but reiterated that he wanted a capital
gains tax cut to be part of the deal.
   ``We've made some headway recently in budget talks,'' Bush told
reporters. ``But it really is time now to get an agreement now. I
think we owe that to the American people.''
   Negotiators at the talks, which entered their tenth day, have
said the fight between Democrats and Republicans over reducing the
capital gains tax rate is the key dispute blocking an agreement.
   Republicans have pushed to reduce that tax, which is charged on
the profits from the sales of property, arguing that it would
stimulate the economy. But Democrats have said the proposal would
help almost exclusively the wealthy, and have insisted that if it
is included in the package, there must also be a tax rate hike for
the rich.
   The bargainers, meeting at Andrews om nearby Maryland, swapped
new budget cutting offers late Monday. Both packages were aimed at
reducing the deficit by about $50 billion next year and by $500
billion through 1995. The two sides both wanted about $25 billion
of the savings next year to come from new taxes and fees.
   But the Democrat offer was contingent on not having a capital
gains cut as part of the package, while the Republican offer
contained the cut and offset it by eliminating the deduction for
state and local taxes for people earning more than $200,000
annually, said one official close to the talks.
   But Republicans said there were major additional differences
between the two sides that had caused the Andrews talks to end.
   They complained that while their package cut defense spending by
$170 billion over five years, the Democratic plan specified cuts of
only $10 billion next year and $23 billion in fiscal 1992. The
reductions for the three years beyond that were left unclear.
   In recent days, Democrats had offered to cut military spending
by $200 billion over the next five years.
   Republicans also complained that Democrats were not willing to
cut domestic programs deeply enough. GOP bargainers wanted to pare
benefit programs like Medicare by $123.3 billion over the money
they would need to stay even with inflation over the next five
years. Democrats wanted to limit the cut to $120.6 billion.
   Unless a deficit-cutting package is in place by Oct. 1, the
beginning of the next fiscal year, the Gramm-Rudman law will
automatically trigger about $100 billion in cuts in the $1.2
trillion federal budget, an amount considered high enough to
seriously disrupt government operations.
   ``There hasn't been one darn thing since we started that anybody
has agreed on,'' complained one of the bargainers, Rep. Silvio
Conte, R-Mass. earlier Monday.
   Conte and House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., said some
lawmakers are beginning to discuss legislation that would
temporarily postpone the Gramm-Rudman spending cuts unless a budget
deal is worked out. Both men said they opposed the idea, but
declined to say who was considering it.
   Ever since making it an issue during his 1988 election campaign,
Bush has pushed to lower the top tax rate on capital gains, the
profits from the sale of property. He has argued that a reduction
would invigorate the economy by encouraging people to sell.
   Democrats have labeled the proposal a boon to the wealthy that
would lower government revenues in the long run. They have said
that if the tax cut is to be included in a deficit-cutting package,
they want it accompanied by higher income tax rates on the rich.
   Without a budget deal, next year's shortfall is expected to
exceed $250 billion, which would be the highest mark ever.

   Nearly a year after an earthquake killed 67
people and jolted nationwide TV viewers expecting the World Series,
San Francisco's supervisors still enter their chambers through an
archway braced by timbers.
   The Embarcadero Freeway is still deserted, weeds sprouting from
cracked concrete. An estimated 1,000 people left homeless by the
7.1-magnitude tremor sleep in doorways and shelters while the city
negotiates redevelopment funds to rebuild hotels.
   In Santa Cruz, a seaside tourist town eight miles from the Oct.
17 quake's epicenter, chain-link fences ring downtown craters where
the shuddering Earth crumbled Victorian buildings, cracking
colonnades and toppling turrets.
   From San Francisco to Watsonville, businesses, homes and
freeways severely damaged by the Loma Prieta quake remain in ruins,
and officials estimate it will be five to 10 years before the worst
of the $7 billion-$10 billion damage is repaired.
   None of the agencies involved was willing to estimate the final
price tag, which will include seismic renovations to protect
against the ``The Really Big One.''
   ``It's one of the most depressing things I've ever been through
in my life. It's like it was nuclear bombed. All the buildings are
gone ... I can imagine going through World War II and coming home
to see your city totally destroyed,'' said Bob Shepherd. He was
Santa Cruz city finance manager until he resigned Aug. 17 to teach.
   Only one of the 15 buildings demolished in the town centerpiece,
Pacific Garden Mall, is under construction. Five others have
permits, said Ceil Cerillo, executive director of the city's
redevelopment agency.
   More than 35 businesses sell their wares out of six tent
pavilions.
   Ten miles south in Watsonville, a town of migrant field hands
and cannery workers, the gutted Main Street has barely begun to
revive. The largest retailer, Ford's Department Store, announced in
mid-August it will rebuild with help from Federal Emergency
Management Agency funds.
   In Oakland, where the quake stunned a downtown revitalization
effort, several blocks of stores and office buildings remain
boarded up.
   Oakland City Hall, which dates to 1914, is ringed with
scaffolding and closed to the public while the city dickers with
FEMA over how much of the $90 million renovation the agency will
reimburse.
   San Francisco officials won't begin the $100 million repair of
the Beaux Arts City Hall until they settle with FEMA.
   ``There is still no agreement. It's stupid to work on our
buildings while we're negotiating what's eligible. ... We'd have
removed the evidence,'' said Tom Jones of the mayor's Office of
Community Development and Housing.
   Drivers in and out of the city continue to face traffic jams on
U.S. 101 and Interstate 280, sections of which remain closed. The
Embarcadero, the lifeline to Chinatown and North Beach nightclubs,
remains a hulking ruin while the city decides whether to replace it
with an underground expressway.
   Repairs to these roads are estimated at $160 million. That does
not include $100 million to replace Interstate 880's Cypress
overpass, where 42 of the quake victims died after it collapsed.
   ``When the freeways reopen, we'll be the foremost engineers in
the world on earthquake repairs. We want to do it right; safety is
the main issue,'' said Greg Bayol, spokesman for the state
Department of Transportation.
   Some homeowners in San Francisco's heavily damaged Marina
District, where only two of 54 demolished buildings have been
reoccupied, found $500,000 Small Business Administration loans too
little too late.
   One woman interviewed by the city received word she was eligible
for a no-interest 20-year loan from CALDAP, a state program, one
day after she agreed to sell her $2.5 million property for $1
million to pay her note.
   ``The earthquake happened at the same time as the savings and
loan crisis,'' said Jones. ``Most lenders were willing to forgive
one or two months, but when the crisis hit, the lenders starting
calling their loans.''
   Owners of transient hotels in Oakland and San Francisco found
SBA loans inadequate to repair the dilapidated buildings that
housed an estimated 2,500 elderly, mentally disabled and poor
people left permanently homeless by the quake.
   Officials estimate it will be five years before the freeways are
restored and at least three years before hotels are rebuilt with
help of emergency redevelopment funds, said Bill Rumpf, chief of
San Francisco's redevelopment agency.
   ``The process takes months and years,'' said Henry Renteria,
Oakland's head of emergency services. ``In Whittier and Coalinga,
their earthquakes were years ago and there are still buildings with
issues not resolved.''

   As one of the Senate's staunchest
conservatives for a dozen years, Orrin Hatch might be expected to
be among lawmakers campaigning to slash federal grants for the
arts.
   But the Utah Republican who spent two years as a Mormon
missionary is taking a pass.
   He shakes his head glumly at moves to curb funding for the
National Endowment for the Arts on grounds that some of the money
has gone to projects tainted by obscenity.
   ``No one is more against obscenity and pornography than I am,
but I just don't believe that the Congress should impose censorship
through the authorization process,'' Hatch said.
   ``Some of these people, if they had lived in the time of
Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, the Sistine Chapel would never
have been painted,'' Hatch says of lawmakers heading the drive.
``They wouldn't allow you to hang a Reubens in the Senate.''
   Hatch is scrupulously polite and soft-spoken, although sometimes
an emotional side surfaces unexpectedly.
   When the Senate debated rights for the disabled in July, Hatch
was telling how his brother-in-law suffered as a victim of polio.
Suddenly, he ``just broke down.''
   ``I mean I just wept, tears rolling down my cheeks,'' Hatch
recalls. ``I was embarrassed because I don't like people to know
that side of me that much.''
   From the scourge of the liberals to patron of the arts and other
issues irksome to conservatives, Hatch's political persona is
undergoing a distinct change.
   When Hatch arrived in the Senate in 1977, he was immediately
accepted as one of the fiercest conservatives to prowl the floor.
Over the last two years, though, he's been at odds with old allies
more than once.
   Despite conservative opposition, he spearheaded in 1989 a $1.75
billion-a-year package of child-care grants. He's campaigned for
escalation of the battle against AIDS. And he sponsored a Justice
Department program aimed at fighting ``hate crimes'' motivated by
racial and religious bias.
   The hate crimes bill put Hatch on a collision course with Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who called it ``the flagship of the gay rights
agenda.''
   Hatch, 56, scoffs at the notion that he's changed: He remains a
supporter of capital punishment, a critic of gun control and an
opponent of a major civil rights bill on Capitol Hill whose
minority-hiring provision, he says, would inevitably lead to hiring
quotas.
   All the same, a recent poll showed many Utah voters believe he's
moved in a more liberal direction.
   And he's finding increasing favor with lawmakers he once fought.
   ``He is open on some things,'' said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill. ``He
has grown, and I hope we can all grow. He was superb on the
hate-crimes bill.''
   Lean at 6-foot-4, with every silvery hair in place and a taste
for conservatively tailored dark suits and blazers, Hatch likes to
tell of his humble origins as the son of a Pittsburgh metal lather.
   ``I grew up on the wrong side of the tracks,'' he says. ``We
were poor, poor people.''
   He worked as a janitor to help pay his way through Brigham Young
University, where he met his wife, Elaine. They have three sons,
three daughters and 10 grandchildren.
   He graduated from the University of Pittsburgh Law School and
practiced in that city before returning to Utah.
   In 1976, he upset incumbent Democratic Sen. Frank Moss, in part
with the help of hundreds of Hatches in rural Utah, their numbers a
legacy of the heavily Mormon state's polygamous past.
   Moss and other Democrats, however, blamed rough-and-tumble
tactics by New Right conservatives - Washington groups whose
trademark was mail-order campaigns designed to rise funds and
energize voters around issues such as abortion and school prayer.
   In the Senate, Hatch is a vocal member of the Judiciary
Committee where he ranks second behind Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
But his major post is that of top Republican on the Labor
Committee, where he's often at odds with Chairman Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass.
   But frequently, Hatch and Kennedy reach a compromise, as they
did on a Hatch bill opposed by some liberals that allows export of
pharmaceuticals not yet approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for use in this country.
   Indeed, the Hatch record on such matters gives business little
to complain about.
   He is a firm backer of bills to rein in court damages in product
liability and medical malpractice lawsuits - major goals of the
insurance industry. And he's sponsoring a bill to allow the federal
government to pre-empt tough state standards governing pesticides
in foods.
   Hatch scoffs at complaints from liberal consumer groups that his
bill would allow unsafe concentrations of pesticides in foods.
   ``That's not based on science,'' he says. ``That's based on old
wives' tales.''
   Senate Republicans take little notice of strained ties between
Hatch and conservative activists. They hail him as hard-working and
effective.
   ``I'm a real admirer of Orrin Hatch,'' said Sen. John C.
Danforth, R-Mo.
   ``He undertakes the toughest chores in the Senate because he is
the ranking Republican on the Labor Committee,'' Danforth said.
``The issues he involves himself in are often hotly controversial
and take up a good deal of the Senate's time, but he does his job
with unflappable competence.''
   But such testimonials leave hard-core conservatives unmoved.
   ``He has separated himself from us ... on social welfare
legislation, on what we would call gay rights legislation, on a
whole range of issues,'' said New Right pioneer Paul Weyrich.
   Weyrich says Hatch has been shopping for issues to help broaden
his support and hopes for an appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Indeed, when Justice William Brennan announced his retirement,
reporters were quick to corner Hatch and ask if he wanted the post.
He said no.
   Hatch also says he's always been a champion of the underdog and
that perhaps his conservative critics just haven't noticed.
   ``I have always been an advocate of those with disabilities,
those who are downtrodden, who really can't help themselves,'' he
said. ``What I have a problem with is people who can help
themselves but won't.''
   At the same time, he says his conservative critics should take a
more careful look at his overall record.
   ``I wonder who they think took the lead in fighting for a lot of
the changes around here,'' he said, his voice rising. ``I wonder
who they think fought for fairness in the Iran-Contra hearings.''
   That view is echoed by writer-activist Patrick McGuigan, author
of a recent book on the battle over Robert Bork's nomination to the
Supreme Court. McGuigan is an outspoken Hatch admirer, but says
many would disagree.
   ``There are a lot ofconservatives who don't know him as well as
I do who think Orrin Hatch has gone around the bend,'' says
McGuigan. ``They think he isn't a conservative anymore.''

   Children in this biblical Arab town
used to copy stone-throwing Palestinians of the occupied
territories in a game called ``Intefadeh.'' Now they play ``Burn
the American flag.''
   They are responding to what many adults in Kufr Kanna and other
Arab towns in Israel have said since the U.S.-Iraqi showdown began:
Saddam Hussein is a hero who will unite Arabs against the United
States and its ally, Israel.
   Most Israeli Jews have been startled by such wide support for
the Iraqi president among Israel's 800,000 Arab citizens. Liberals
are disappointed and hard-liners cry ``treason,'' some even urging
that Arab citizens be expelled.
   ``The Arabs in Israel are crossing a red line, support for an
enemy who is threatening to annihilate half of Israel with chemical
weapons,'' said Eliezer Tsafrir, Arab affairs adviser to Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   ``We used to say the majority of our Arab citizens are loyal to
the state. We must go on saying that, but I'm not sure any longer
how accurate it is.''
   Tsafrir said ``Saddamania'' was further weakening Jewish-Arab
coexistence already hurt by Israeli Arab support for the
33-month-old Palestinian intefadeh, or uprising, in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Support for Saddam among Israeli Arabs springs partly from anger
about their treatment by the Jewish majority.
   They were under military government until 1966 and, today, their
communities get only about one-quarter the government funds given
to similar Jewish towns.
   Moslem fundamentalism also plays a role. The fundamentalists are
angry that American ``infidels'' have been sent into Saudi Arabia
near Moslem holy places.
   A study by Givat Haviva, a left-wing Israeli think tank, found
that Israeli Arab intellectuals initially condemned the Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, but rallied behind Saddam when U.S.
troops entered Arab lands.
   Outspoken support for Saddam is the rule in Kufr Kanna, a
hillside farming town of 12,000 north of Nazareth that is believed
to be where Jesus changed water into wine.
   Two weeks after Iraq's invasion, about 2,000 people marched
through town, carrying banners with such slogans as ``Saddam, hit
the Americans and Israel with chemical weapons.''
   The marchers burned an American flag and pictures of Hosni
Mubarak, president of Egypt, who has cooperated with the U.S.
defense of Saudi Arabia.
   Omar Saeed, a leader of the nationalist Sons of the Village
movement, said the demonstration inspired the children's game of
pretending to burn makeshift American flags.
   Saeed, a self-proclaimed socialist, sees Saddam as a fellow
revolutionary because he ousted Kuwait's oil-rich royal family.
   ``Saddam is leading the revolution of the poor; he is the Arabs'
Robin Hood,'' Saeed, 30, said in the living room of his father's
two-story home overlooking the town.
   He has an apartment in Haifa, where he is studying for a
doctorate in pharmacology at an Israeli university, and said most
of his Jewish neighbors call him a traitor.
   ``They are saying, `If you are with Saddam, you are against us,'
but my professor said he would fight for my right to speak my
mind,'' said Saeed, who spent four years under house arrest and six
months in prison for nationalist activities.
   His 65-year-old father, Radwan, described Saddam as a savior
fighting to unite Arabs, in the tradition of the late Egyptian
president, Gamal Abdel Nasser.
   Radwan Saeed, who been under town arrest for 10 years because of
nationalist activities, pointed to a picture of Nasser on the wall
and said: ``Tomorrow, we'll have a picture of Saddam up there as
well.''
   Jews are shocked by such sentiments from Arab countrymen, who
remained silent during Israel's wars with its Arab neighbors.
   ``I didn't expect to find them on friendly terms with such a
dictator,'' said Yossi Sarid of the left-wing Citizens Rights
Movement. ``Maybe they haven't digested deeply the democratic rules
of the game.''
   Conservative Israeli newspapers suggested the government crack
down on Arabs supporting Saddam.
   ``No one asks that they identify with Israeli policy, but no
state that values its existence can accept the identification of
its citizens with an enemy,'' said an editorial in the daily
Maariv. ``One does not play with fire.''
   On the extremist fringe, U.S.-born Rabbi Meir Kahane of the
anti-Arab Kach movement said Israeli Arabs should be expelled.
   ``I saw on television, how the Arabs of Kufr Kanna . . . our
Arabs, good Arabs, faithful Arabs, marched in support of this
dictator,'' Kahane said at a rally. ``Friends, if we want a common
policy, it is `Throw the Arabs out'.''
   Tsafrir said there were no plans for action against Israeli
Arabs unless they broke the law, but noted that growing resentment
by Jews would make it more difficult to redress the imbalance in
funding for Arab towns.
   In Kufr Kanna, Mayor Aref Hamdan said Arabs were angry over
``separate and unequal'' policies under which a permit for building
a factory had been denied. The town's unemployment rate is about 25
percent, more than twice the Jewish rate.
   Mohammed Abbas, unemployed after losing jobs in his field of
biology and as a waiter, said: ``The Jews think we are weak,
inferior people. We have to explain ourselves to them all the time,
say that we are loyal to the state. They never explain themselves
to us.''

   No one stays at this assembly area for
more than a day, the sergeant major explained. Except that a day
can sometimes last two weeks or more.
   This industrial area in the desert is first stop for many new
troops arriving in Saudi Arabia. The gritty landscape of dusty
mills and corrogated metal buildings is covered with long rows of
olive drab tents.
   Units arrive here each day to receive their assignments. The
expectation is they will quickly be shipped somewhere else.
   ``Welcome to Ellis Island,'' one officer said by way of
explanation.
   The 265th Quartermaster Detachment, a South Carolina National
Guard unit mobilized to run water purification equipment in this
dry country, arrived over the weekend.
   But so far the only water the 14 men have seen is in the 1.5
liter bottles handed out to them several times a day. Like so many
other units staying here, the 265th is an orphan looking for a
home.
   ``We got to get going here,'' said Sgt. Ronnie Jackson, who
leads the 14 men from Allendale, S.C. ``We need to go to a place we
can start working.''
   The urgency to get out isn't rooted in work ethic alone. As an
intelligence officer pointed out matter-of-factly, this place is
considered a prime Iraqi target.
   It doesn't take much to see that. There are no bunkers, no
trenches; no where to run or hide.
   ``You get an air strike in here, this place will get torn up
bad,'' said Jackson.
   So the sergeant spent his time looking to get the unit
officially adopted, driving to various headquarters areas, trying
to learn where his unit is headed.
   The wide, empty six-lane highways carried only a light traffic
of U.S. troops in HUM-VEE's and pickups and Saudis in Toyotas and
Mercedes. Many of the Saudis waved as they rocketed past at speeds
well over 60 mph.
   Jackson's quest took him to a civilian airport still under
construction. Inside the broad concourses and baggage areas,
Americans with charts, lists and field telephones were busy keeping
up with the paperwork of near-war.
   The initial news wasn't good. The battalion the 265th is
assigned to hasn't made it in country yet.
   ``That's Uncle Sam for you,'' said Spc. Bobby Youmans. ``He'll
put you on hold like a telephone.''
   Back at the assembly area, the unit settled into temporary
housekeeping in a 15-by-60-foot tent set in the sandy dirt.
   There wasn't much to do in the heat of the day. Mostly the men
snoozed on their cots, listened to the radio, swapped portions of
their rations and kidded each other about sex.
   The relative peace was broken several times a day as F-15s
screamed overhead on their way to patrol duty to the north.
   Most were a little disappointed with their first glimpses of
Saudi Arabia.
   ``This isn't what I expected,'' said Spc. Mark Rooker as he
tried to clear the grit off his clothes. ``I didn't think it'd be
this dirty.''
   Youmans was waiting to take in the sights. ``I need to see a
camel bad,'' he said.
   What passed for sightseeing was a stroll down sunblasted streets
to a variety store off base. Latrines were down the street. So were
a hastily constructed set of showers.
   Sunset came with a hint of relief from the day's dusty heat as
three members of the 265th took up guard duty, stopping vehicles
coming onto post. The M-16s on their shoulders weren't loaded.
Clips of ammunition were in their pockets.

<HEAD>Prosecutors: Barry Will Not Be Tried Again</HEAD>

   Prosecutors are hinting they may seek a jail
term for Mayor Marion Barry on his cocaine possession conviction,
but they say he won't be retried on a dozen charges that deadlocked
a federal jury.
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens announced Monday that Barry would
not be retried on the 12 charges, including one involving an FBI
videotape of the mayor smoking crack cocaine.
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson set sentencing
for Oct. 26.
   Asked whether he will recommend that Barry be sent to prison,
Stephens said ``the latitude is there for ... (sentencing) of a
full year in prison, which we believe is an adequate basis of
punishment for Mr. Barry.''
   The prosecutor refused to elaborate, saying only that he will
make a sentencing recommendation to Jackson.
   Under federal sentencing guidelines, Barry could face a maximum
penalty of one year in prison and a $100,000 fine.
   ``I'm obviously relieved at this phase of the legal
proceedings,'' Barry said after the U.S. attorney's decision was
announced. He declined further comment.
   Barry is running for an at-large city council seat. Earlier, he
had announced he would not seek a fourth, four-year term as mayor.
   During a five-minute court hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Judith Retchin said simply, ``The government has made a
determination not to seek retrial on the pending counts.''
   The government's decision comes five weeks after Barry's
two-month trial ended with his conviction on one misdemeanor
cocaine possession charge, acquittal on another and a mistrial on
the 12 remaining counts - three felony perjury charges and nine
misdemeanor counts.
   Stephens said, ``Mr. Barry's political status and political
future are not factors we considered when making decisions about
this prosecution.''
   The jury's verdict was widely interpreted at the time as a
victory for the mayor.
   But Stephens said Monday, ``When all the dust is settled, in the
final analysis, the ultimate truth will remain - that the chief
executive of this city charged with the responsibility of leading
the fight against illegal drugs and violence has himself been
convicted of contributing to that human devastation.''
   While Barry escaped conviction on most of the charges against
him - including the three felonies, which carried mandatory jail
sentences - he was forced to pay a political price.
   Current and former Barry administration sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said one reason Barry announced he would
not seek re-election as mayor was to let the jury know he had
already made sacrifices and cast himself in a sympathetic light.
   Barry's decision not to seek re-election opened the door for
political newcomer Sharon Pratt Dixon, who won last week's
Democratic mayoral primary. Dixon's pledges to clean up the
government and reduce the city work force drew support that was
interpreted by many as a sign that city voters want a change from
Barry's ways.
   After Dixon's victory, the mayor acknowledged that ``the people
have said they want something different,'' but he has stood by his
decision to attempt a political comeback.
   The jury's decision followed a dramatic eight-week trial
featuring a videotape of Barry smoking crack cocaine the night he
was arrested in an FBI sting operation.
   Barry's lawyer argued that federal prosecutors had improperly
trapped him by asking a female friend to invite him to the hotel
and to press him repeatedly about whether he wanted drugs.
   Before Monday's status hearing, prosecutors gave no indication
whether they would try the mayor again. Earlier this month, Terry
Halperin, the U.S. attorney for the Virgin Islands, announced that
she would not bring charges against the mayor there.
   One of the felony perjury charges and a conspiracy charge
against Barry involved alleged drug activity in the Virgin Islands
during 1986 and 1988.

<HEAD>Arts Endowment Chief Backs Senate Bill on `Obscene Art'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The beleaguered chairman of the National
Endowment for the Arts is applauding a Senate bill that would give
the courts - not his agency - the burden of deciding whether some
federally subsidized works of art are obscene.
   NEA chairman John E. Frohnmayer said the Senate measure and a
report by a bipartisan commission last week ``give us hope that the
crisis will soon pass'' over federal support for controversial art.
   Frohnmayer refused, however, to scrap a much-criticized
requirement that NEA grant recipients sign an anti-obscenity pledge
before they can receive federal money.
   He said he would delay a decision on eliminating the pledge
until Congress decides whether to impose new anti-obscenity
restrictions on the endowment and a federal court in New York rules
on the constitutionality of the pledge.
   At a news conference Monday at the National Press Club,
Frohnmayer said there was ``zero truth to those rumors'' that he
would resign soon, after a turbulent year as NEA chairman.
   The endowment is an independent, $171 million federal agency
that supports a wide variety of artists and arts organizations. It
has been the target of heavy criticism for the past 18 months from
conservative lawmakers and religious fundamentalists who accuse the
NEA of subsidizing obscene and sacrilegious works.
   Last week, the Senate Labor and Human Resources approved a
bipartisan compromise bill extending the NEA for five years beyond
Sept. 30, when its statutory authority expires. The bill would
require the NEA to recoup funds from grant recipients who are
convicted of violating obscenity laws.
   Frohnmayer said this provision ``puts the determination of
obscenity in the courts, where it should be.''
   Last October, at the urging of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
Congress voted to prohibit the NEA from spending federal funds on
any works that ``may be considered obscene,'' including depictions
of homoeroticism, sadomasochism and the sexual exploitation of
children.
   A month later, Frohnmayer began requiring grant recipients to
sign a pledge that they would not use federal money to produce
works that might be deemed obscene.
   The anti-obscenity pledge stirred widespread protests in the
arts community. A dozen grant recipients refused to sign it and
forfeited their grants. Three federal lawsuits filed in New York
and Los Angeles charge that the pledge violates First Amendment
guarantees of free expression.
   The 12-member independent study commission created by Congress
urged Frohnmayer last week to scrap the pledge. A similar plea was
made earlier by the NEA's presidentially appointed advisory body,
the National Council on the Arts.
   The study commission endorsed the NEA but recommended changes in
its grant-making procedures to make the agency more responsive to
the public's interests. The panel also urged Congress not to impose
any new restrictions on the kinds of art eligible for NEA subsidies
when the current anti-obscenity ban expires on Sept. 30.

   Six blacks are among a dozen candidates
scrambling to claim the House seat in Louisiana being vacated by
Rep. Lindy Boggs, the only white in Congress who represents a
district that is mostly black.
   Mrs. Boggs, 74, announced in July that she was stepping down for
personal reasons after more than 17 years in the House. The popular
Democratic congresswoman enjoyed strong support from New Orleans
voters in all age, ethnic and economic groups throughout her
tenure.
   But despite Mrs. Boggs' strong record on civil rights issues and
her support in the black community, blacks were growing anxious to
elect one of their own in the district, which has a 60 percent
black voting majority.
   Many believe 1990 may be the last year a black can be elected
from the district. Since New Orleans lost people in the 1980s,
district lines drawn after the 1990 census are expected to reduce
or eliminate the black majority.
   Even before Mrs. Boggs announced in July that she would retire
at the end of this term, two prominent black Democrats had
announced plans to run for her seat.
   But since she dropped out, race has not been much of an issue,
since four of the five major candidates are black.
   One of them, attorney Michael Bagneris, has said that whites who
live in New Orleans are starting to feel as disenfranchised as
blacks did before the civil rights movement. Black political groups
must work to include whites and avoid repeating the ``folly'' of
the past, he says.
   ``I see as the major issue getting everyone to focus on the
major issues and not to focus, as we have so often done in the
past, on superficial things such as personality or race,'' he says.
   Mrs. Boggs had taken 75 to 90 percent of the vote in almost
every race since she decided to run to succeed her husband, Rep.
Hale Boggs, who disappeared on a plane flight over Alaska in 1973.
   Her most serious challenge was in 1984, after court-ordered
redistricting to meet the requirements of the Voting Rights Act
altered the makeup of her district and left it 60 percent black.
   In that race, Israel Augustine, a respected black judge, got 39
percent of the vote. Still, Mrs. Boggs' long record of work for
civil rights and her political power brought her 38 percent of the
black vote in that election.
   Mrs. Boggs did not elaborate on her reasons for retiring, but it
has been widely reported that she wanted to spend more time with
her daughter, Barbara Sigmund, the mayor of Princeton, N.J., who
has cancer.
   Political observers say the leading black candidates to succeed
Mrs. Boggs are state Sens. William Jefferson and Jon Johnson and
attorneys Marc Morial and Bagneris. The leading white candidate is
school board member Harwood ``Woody'' Koppel. All are Democrats.
   They and most of the other seven candidates are running on a
pledge to improve New Orleans' economy, which never recovered from
the 1980s collapse in oil prices.
   In all, six Democrats, two Republicans and four independents are
running in Louisiana's open primary, in which all candidates are on
the same Oct. 6 ballot regardless of party. If nobody gets more
than half the vote, the top two will be in a runoff Nov. 6.
   With less than a month to go before the primary, it's too early
to predict who will make a runoff, said Loyola University pollster
and political analyst Ed Renwick.
   ``I think it's quite possible that a runoff would be between two
blacks,'' Renwick said.
   Jefferson has been endorsed by Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, and
Johnson by Gov. Buddy Roemer.
   Morial, son of the late former Mayor Dutch Morial, has his
father's name and his mother Sybil's active and influential
support. Bagneris is a protege of the elder Morial but has support
from both blacks and whites.
   Koppel got 21 percent of the vote in the five-person 1973
Democratic primary for the special election that put Mrs. Boggs
into the House.
   Currently, there are 23 black members of the U.S. House.

   Remarks about plans for possible U.S. air
assaults on Iraq cost Gen. Michael J. Dugan his job as Air Force
chief of staff, but the incident was not the first time the
four-star general rankled his Pentagon bosses.
   Dugan, fired by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Monday, said in
a statement that he regretted ``any embarrassment'' his comments
caused the Bush administration. Cheney said Dugan, 53, would be
forced to retire, ending a 32-year Air Force career that included a
stint as commander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe.
   Several days after President Bush committed U.S. troops to
Operation Desert Shield on Aug. 7 to deter a possible Iraqi
invasion of Saudi Arabia, Dugan was quoted in a published report as
saying the United States had ruled out using chemical weapons or
battlefield nuclear arms if fighting broke out with Iraq.
   That comment caused a stir in the Pentagon, where military
authorities have been careful not to preclude any options in order
to complicate Baghdad's planning.
   Dugan also had been the object of private complaints by U.S.
commanders in Saudi Arabia.
   An aide to Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, told a reporter during Powell's visit to Saudi Arabia last
week that Dugan was one of several military authorities who were
talking too much in public about contingency plans.
   ``Saddam already has you guys giving away the store, we don't
need to help him any more,'' the aide said, speaking privately.
   In explaining his decision to dump Dugan, Cheney told a Pentagon
news conference that the Air Force chief displayed a ``lack of
judgment'' by engaging publicly in ``wide-ranging speculation''
about U.S. military options in Iraq.
   Dugan was quoted by the Los Angeles Times and The Washington
Post as saying the Joint Chiefs of Staff had decided that U.S. air
power - including a massive bombing campaign against Baghdad that
specifically targeted President Saddam Hussein - was the only
effective way to force Iraq out of Kuwait if war erupted.
   ``If and when we choose violence he ought to be at the focus of
our efforts,'' Dugan was quoted as saying, referring to a military
strategy known as decapitation.
   Cheney said Dugan confirmed to him that he had made the
comments, which were reported by the newspapers during Dugan's
visit last week to U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia.
   In his brief statement issued through the Air Force public
affairs office at the Pentagon, Dugan said his comments to the
Times and Post reflected his personal views and ``should not be
construed to reflect any plans or the position'' of the Bush
administration.
   ``I sincerely regret any embarrassment that my comments may have
caused the administration,'' Dugan said. Officials in his Pentagon
office said he was not available for further comment Monday.
   Cheney told reporters he would recommend to Bush that Gen.
Merrill A. McPeak replace Dugan. McPeak, 54, is commander of
Pacific Air Forces, based in Hawaii.
   Dugan took the top Air Force job in July and quickly gained a
reputation for openness with the news media and Congress. One
gesture that illustrated this departure from past Air Force
practice was his decision to give defense reporters laminated cards
listing his office phone number and the numbers of his chief aides.
   An Irishman with a breezy personal style, Dugan's attempts at
openness were a clear departure from the practice of his
predecessors. A small example of Dugan's approach was his recent
insistence that his public affairs office respond immediately to a
published report in which an airman in Saudi Arabia complained of a
lack of gear designed to protect against chemical arms attacks.
   Cheney lauded Dugan's long Air Force career but said the
four-star general has no future in the military.
   ``He will be retired,'' Cheney said. ``Gen. Dugan is a fine
officer with an outstanding record of 32 years of service to the
Air Force and to the nation,'' Cheney said. ``This was not a
pleasant action for me to take but a necessary one.''

<HEAD>President Heads Out On Behalf of GOP Candidates</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Bush leaves 9:55 a.m. EDT for Denver</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush is embarking on a heavy
campaign schedule for GOP candidates, and nowhere is his stumping
as important to his party as in the California gubernatorial
contest he visits this week.
   Bush hopes to raise at least $2 million in a trio of appearances
devoted to helping Sen. Pete Wilson become the next California
governor.
   Bush told a news conference Monday that he hopes he won't be
drawn anew into a controversy over drilling off California's coast.
   ``I've got enough problems right here in Washington without
commenting on a provision out there,'' Bush said when asked about a
proposed state initiative - opposed by Wilson - to ban offshore
drilling.
   Bush has imposed a 10-year moratorium on new drilling off
California.
   ``If the question is put to me at a press conference, `Do you
want to ban offshore drilling' the answer will be no,''' Bush
continued.
   But, he said, if he were asked whether he should change his
decision on the moratorium, ``I'll say, `No, I don't think I need
to do that.'''
   Before flying to the West Coast today, Bush planned to stop in
Denver en route to lend a hand in Rep. Hank Brown's bid for the
U.S. Senate.
   The two-day trip is one of several campaign swings the White
House has scheduled for Bush between now and the November election.
   From Denver today, he was heading to a $1,000-a-person
fund-raising dinner in Los Angeles, to boost Wilson's campaign
coffers.
   On Wednesday, Bush attends a breakfast for the California
Republican Party before heading to San Francisco for a
$1,000-a-ticket luncheon that also benefits the Wilson campaign.
   The California race pits Wilson, the state's low-key, two-term
U.S. senator, against the Democratic nominee, former San Francisco
Mayor Dianne Feinstein.
   Bush's help with fund-raising is key in a race that is based
mostly on expensive, dueling TV commercials. Wilson plans to spend
more than $15 million to defeat Feinstein, campaign aides say.
   Beyond keeping control of the governor's seat in the nation's
largest state, national strategists are pulling out all the stops
in the campaign because of its implications in the future makeup of
Congress.
   California will gain seven new seats in Congress in the 1991
redistricting because of its population growth which now gives it
one-ninth of the nation's population.
   The process redraws congressional district lines based on
population, and the boundaries can determine which party will win
the district's House seat.
   With California's Democratic-controlled legislature in charge of
approving the new district boundaries, only a gubernatorial veto
gives the Republicans hope of staving off a Democratic windfall in
congressional seats.
   ``It is the motherlode of congressional seats,'' said Ed Rogers,
who heads the White House political office. Wilson's race, he said,
``is the number one target'' for the Republican Party.
   Recent polls have shown the race a virtual dead heat, although
the Wilson camp says its polling shows the senator is inching
ahead.
   Bush made a political trip to Calfornia in February and is
expected to return again before election day.
   He was expected to tailor his remarks in Los Angeles and San
Francisco to coordinate with Wilson's current campaign emphasis on
crime issues.
   Wilson is airing two tough-on-crime commercials: one
spotlighting his advocacy of legislation to treat drug-addicted
mothers who give birth to so-called crack babies, and his work for
a successful state anti-crime initiative.
   In Colorado, Brown had no primary opposition and faces Josie
Heath, whose only background in elected office was as Boulder
County commissioner.
   Still the Republicans are not taking the race for granted, GOP
strategists say, and are focusing on keeping the state's
non-aligned independent voters from gravitating toward Heath, who
ran a strong campaign.
   Brown and Heath are vying to succeed retiring Sen. William
Armstrong, one of three Republican senators stepping down
nationwide.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal researchers should be more open-minded
about unconventional treatments that show some potential to help
cancer patients, a four-year congressional study concludes.
   The study by the Office of Technology Assessment found that none
of the alternative methods it reviewed - including psychological,
nutritional and herbal remedies - was obviously or dramatically
effective.
   But the report also said these treatments have had little, if
any, scientific review, which leaves patients with no guidance if
they want to supplement or replace their conventional treatment.
   ``It's very hard to get information beyond promotional
brochures,'' said Roger C. Herdman, who supervised the report,
which was released Monday. ``There isn't a lot in the peer-reviewed
literature,'' where scientific findings are reported.
   Yet, thousands of cancer patients have turned to alternative
treatments, most after undergoing at least some conventional
treatment for their disease, the report said.
   ``It's worthwhile to give serious thought to unconventional
approaches to serious diseases,'' Herdman said.
   ``We suggested a more systematic and more aggressive look be
taken by some of the responsible agencies,'' including the National
Cancer Institute, provided there was reason to believe the
treatment could benefit patients, he said.
   The report urges researchers ``to take a sympathetic and
thoughtful look at some of these treatments,'' he said.
   Officials at the National Cancer Institute had not seen the
report and therefore could not comment on it, institute spokesman
Paul Van Nevel said.
   The study was not intended to evaluate the effectiveness of
alternative cancer treatments, but rather to help members of
Congress deal with such issues as insurance reimbursement of cancer
treatments and research and development funding. Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee,
requested the review in August 1986.
   Dingell called the report ``balanced'' and said it ``tells us
that some alternative approaches to cancer treatment can have both
physiological and psychological benefits, which should not be
ignored by physicians.
   ``It is clear we need better information on these treatments,
and that the federal government should consider its role in that
effort,'' he said.
   Proponents of unconventional treatments had been very critical
of an earlier, draft version of the report. It was filled with
errors and failed to fault the current system of evaluating these
therapies, they said.
   However, after hearing reports about the final version, the
criticism softened.
   The report recommends that more information be gathered on the
types of patients who use unconventional treatments. It suggests
the federal government could start a registry for documented
reports of tumor regression that appears to be unrelated to
conventional treatment. The government also could collect
information on documented adverse reactions, the report said.
   The report also urged federal funding of efforts to evaluate
unconventional treatments.
   Some methods have been studied, but overall these reviews
``generally have not been well designed and have not met with the
approval of academic researchers,'' the report said.
   Currently, cancer treatments that are considered ``mainstream''
and are usually covered by medical insurance include surgery,
radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and
immunotherapy, which involves manipulating a patient's immune
system to fight the cancer.
   The report said that based on the little information available,
most of the patients who turn to an alternative treatment have had
at least some conventional therapy. Many continue the mainstream
approach while incorporating an alternative method, the report
said.
   Major clinics that offer unconventional therapies charge in the
range of $5,000 to $40,000 for a course of treatment, the report
said.
   Among the alternatives reviewed, the report found that
well-designed studies are beginning to look at the potential of
psychological interventions, like mental imagery and meditation. It
called the results so far ``encouraging,'' but said the value of
these approaches remain uncertain.
   The report also reviews dietary treatments, mixtures of herbal
products and such biologic agents as laetrile, which was popular in
the 1970s and is currently offered by several clinics in Mexico.

   Much of what Air Force Gen. Michael
J. Dugan said that got him fired is indeed part of U.S. contingency
plans for war with Iraq - but Dugan was the only military leader
who discussed the plans publicly in such detail.
   The sheer numbers of the Iraqi military make air power vital for
the United States to defend Saudi Arabia and to launch any
offensive attack, U.S.military leaders have made clear in recent
weeks.
   Interviews with American commanders, Pentagon deployment
announcements and other information released publicly have
indicated that U.S. contingencies include massive air strikes
against Iraqi military and political targets.
   U.S. commanders have said privately that the politics of the
Middle East made it preferable that any attack on Iraq avoid damage
to religious and cultural monuments, so that the United States
would not destroy any chances of diplomatic relations with any
Iraqi government after Saddam Hussein's.
   ``This is Saddam Hussein's war, not the Iraqi people's,'' a
senior Army officer said recently. ``They should not be punished
for his madness.''
   But, until Dugan gave detailed interviews about what he said
were Air Force plans if President Bush ordered an offensive action,
any detailed picture of contingencies for bombing Iraq was
available only by piecing together information from a number of
sources.
   Dugan was fired Monday as commander of the Air Force by Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney, who said Dugan was relieved for discussing
classified ``operational matters'' in great detail.
   Dugan, in interviews with The Los Angeles Times and The
Washington Post, said Air Force contingencies included bombing
places frequented by Saddam Hussein and his inner circle, as well
as military and economic targets.
   From the early stages of the deployment the United States had
announced it was sending massive air power to the region. Some
commanders have been willing to discuss the plans for massive air
strikes, although none in the detail provided by Dugan.
   The publicly announced deployments to the region included F-111
bombers, now stationed in Turkey and Saudi Arabia, the F-117
stealth fighter-bomber and long-range B-52 bombers. Aircraft
carriers in the Red Sea and just outside the Persian Gulf carry A-6
bombers.
   A squadron commander aboard one carrier said two weeks ago his
unit had been briefed on possible bombing runs against Iraqi
targets.
   The United States also sent several AWACS planes to help Saudi
AWACS maintain 24-hour patrols. A U.S. Air Force officer said the
large deployment guaranteed there would be enough AWACS available
to monitor enemy activity in the Middle East and to direct
offensive air activities if ordered to do so.
   In public statements, military leaders including Joint Chiefs of
Staff Chairman Gen. Colin L. Powell and Army Gen. H. Norman
Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, have said
air power is the only way the U.S.-led force could defeat Iraq's
million-man army without overwhelming casualties and extended
fighting. The Iraqi army's strength in the Iran-Iraq war was
holding defensive positions.
   ``We will not start a war but we will finish one quickly in the
air,'' Air Force Col. John McBroom said shortly after the first
U.S. forces arrived in Saudi Arabia. But when asked to be more
specific, McBroom chose a different course than Dugan, responding,
``I'm not going to talk about that.''
   Within two weeks of arriving on Saudi soil, according to
military sources, some U.S. commanders were being briefed on
potential Iraqi targets, including military bases, munitions
factories, power plants and other facilities considered vital to
supplying the Iraqi army in general and its occupation force in
Kuwait in particular.
   A map shown to an Associated Press reporter about two weeks ago
had numerous potential targets in Iraq circled, some as far north
as Baghdad; others in areas closer to Kuwait and Iraq's border with
Saudi Arabia. A handful of Iraqi military bases were among the
potential targets, according to an officer who briefed a reporter
on the condition of anonymity. The officer insisted the specific
locations and names of targets not be identified.
   ``We will use our air superiority to knock out their fighters
and then clear a path allowing us to take out their command and
control operations and supply lines,'' one senior military
commander in Saudi Arabia said privately last week.
   ``Then we will be able to string them out,'' the officer said.
``Without orders and supplies the greater numbers won't be of much
use to Iraq's ground forces.''

<DATELINE>SILOPI, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten years of boom times have suddenly gone
bad along the dusty highway to Iraq.
   The U.N.-ordered embargo on trade with Turkey's neighbor has
struck a devastating blow along the road to the border, forcing
hundreds of merchants to close their shops and seek jobs elsewhere,
local officials say.
   ``The highway was all they had. Now, of course, they will go,''
said Neset Okten, mayor of Silopi.
   A string of small businesses, including bakeries, groceries and
car repair shops, are now empty, forming an extended ghost town
along the route.
   Silopi, nine miles west of the Iraqi border and neighboring
Cizre, 18 miles farther west, are on the only highway linking
Turkey with Iraq.
   In the past decade as Turkish trade with Iraq grew, these
once-sleepy towns of a few thousand population each enjoyed a boom
and populations swelled to 30,000 for Silopi and 70,000 for Cizre.
   About 5,000 trucks and oil tankers passed through the towns
daily, local officials said. Last year, Turkey earned $480 million
from transit fees.
   The highway is two lanes in the border area but is also part of
the E-5 international highway that runs from Western Europe through
Turkey to the Middle East.
   Most of the trucks carried goods for Iraq - food, machinery,
even parts intended for an Iraqi supergun that Turkish officials
managed to intercept. Moving in the other direction, tankers
carried crude oil from Iraq to Turkey.
   The local people, selling spare car parts, food, drinks and
other goods to the drivers, reaped profits from the heavy traffic.
   Now the road is empty, save for some passenger buses and Turkish
military vehicles patrolling the border area for Kurdush
guerrillas.
   Merchants' losses, while devastating to local economies, are
believed to be only a fraction of the $4 billion Turkey says it is
losing this year because it closed two Iraqi oil pipelines that run
through the country and banned all trade with Iraq.
   Bags of sugar, spaghetti, flour and spices were piled up against
a wall at Mehmet Emin's shop in Cizre's market place.
   ``I haven't sold anything today,'' he said.
   Emin said he used to gross $110 a day before Iraq invaded Kuwait
on Aug. 2 and set the Persian Gulf crisis in motion.
   ``Trucks don't drive by anymore,'' he said. ``There are no
customers.''
   Resul Akyurek, who sells sugar, cooking oil, tea, lollipops,
chewing gum and even shoes, said his earnings are down to about $7
a day from about $185 before the crisis.
   ``I cannot even pay my rent now,'' he said.
   The troubles also hit Silopi, an ethnic Kurdish town through
which tens of thousands fleeing Kuwait and Iraq, mostly Asians,
have been crossing into Turkey.
   ``You are the only person who has entered my shop today,'' Salim
Guntas, who sells clothing and shoes, told a reporter.
   At Habur, the border crossing post between Turkey and Iraq, one
man kept watch over arrivals and offered about 20 cents per Kuwaiti
dinar. The dinar was worth $3.80 before the Turkish Central Bank
stopped accepting Kuwaiti and Iraqi currency. The arrivals, mostly
Pakistanis in cars and on foot, were happy to get anything at all
for the money.
   As he counted the bills in the stacks of dinars he had bought,
the money changer explained that he would become rich one day if
the Kuwaiti dinar rose to its old value.

<HEAD>Feinstein Promises to Put Schools First</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dianne Feinstein promises that as governor
she would uphold the provisions of a school financing initiative
that Gov. George Deukmejian and others say contributed greatly to
the state budget crisis.
   Democrat Feinstein said Monday she is committed ``to the
carrying out of the spirit, the letter and the intent of
Proposition 98'' and pledged to make education her top priority at
budget time.
   ``No matter what, schools, aren't going to be shorted,''
Feinstein said. ``No matter what, schools, for the reason of
survival of our people, have to be No. 1 among those budget
priorities.''
   By putting schools first, Feinstein drew a distinction between
her agenda and that of Republican challenger Pete Wilson. The U.S.
senator says public safety is his No. 1 priority, perhaps even at
the expense of education.
   Wilson also says that in reaching budget reform, the state may
have to rethink Proposition 98, which voters approved in November
1988. The measure inserted financial protection for schools into
the state constitution.

<HEAD>Crump Wants Name Removed From November Ballot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State Rep. Dewey Crump, convicted
last week on three felony drug charges, said he has asked the
Missouri Democratic Party to do whatever it can to get his name off
the November ballot.
   ``I believe my constituents are entitled to be represented by
someone who is not the subject of such notoriety as I have
experienced,'' Crump, D-Maryland Heights, said in a statement
released Monday.
   ``Because in my professional life I have always tried to
represent the people I have served to the best of my abilities, I
believe that my recent personal problems would impair my capability
to be the effective state legislator these citizens deserve,'' the
43-year-old lawmaker added.
   Republican Mark Holloway is on the Nov. 6 ballot for Crump's
seat. Last Thursday, Democrat Robert Weatherly filed as a write-in
candidate for the seat.
   State election officials said the deadline for Crump to get his
name off the general election ballot was last Tuesday and that only
death or disqualification could remove the lawmaker's name.

<HEAD>Racing Groups Could `Own' State Government; Loftus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Gov. Tommy G. Thompson's
campaign has engaged in a ``systematic shakedown'' of racing
interests while amassing a $4.6 million treasury, says his
Democratic opponent for governor.
   The comment Monday by state Assembly Speaker Thomas Loftus came
after The Milwaukee Journal reported that dog racing interests had
donated at least $286,00 to Thompson's campaign.
   Thompson's top adviser, Administration Secretary James Klauser,
says Loftus' use of the word ``shakedown'' was a ``dishonest
characterization in an effort to smear (Thompson) through
innuendo.''
   Scott Jensen, director of the governor's campaign, assailed the
Loftus camp for hiring David Fechheimer, a San Francisco
investigator, to review state Racing Board records.
   Michele Carrier, the top Loftus adviser, said Fechheimer was
hired because of his experience in dealing with financial
investigations and the racing industry.
   At a news conference, Loftus questioned why a Florida family
seeking a track license would hire attorney Michael Grebe, chairman
of the Republican Party of Wisconsin, to represent it.
   ``I think it has more to do with his position as Tommy
Thompson's hand-picked chairman of the Republican Party and the
influence he has with the governor than with his legal expertise,''
Loftus said.

<TEXT>
   Abdullah Al Shabnan, smiling the
smile of a 12-year-old, holds in his hand an image of war.
   Abdullah's drawing shows Saddam Hussein, a skull and bones
insignia on his beret, a bloody knife in his hand.
   ``He will die. He will not live,'' Abdullah tells a visitor,
speaking slowly and deliberately, still smiling. ``If I have to, I
will go and fight.''
   Abdullah should be in school back in Kuwait, but he lives these
days as a refugee in a Saudi hotel, spending most of the day
playing in the halls.
   For two hours each day, he gathers with other Kuwaiti children
for a makeshift lesson.
   During a break, they gather on the floor around a table, joking
among themselves as they reach for paper and crayons, rolling on
the floor and running in circles.
   The art they produce is disturbing - dominated by violence,
tanks, blood and destruction.
   ``Of course it bothers us,'' says Khadija, one of the Kuwaiti
women who supervise the children. ``They are children, they should
not have these feelings. But these memories will never go out of
their minds.''
   Khadija, who did not want her family name published because she
fears for relatives still in Kuwait, said the children are not told
what to draw.
   However, in daily lectures to the children women denounce Saddam
and Iraq for invading Kuwait. The talks refer to Saddam as a
killer, madman and thief.
   The children's art is full of the same message.
   Alah, like Abdullah, is 12 and should be in her first week in
the sixth grade, learning English, science, math and other
subjects.
   She pauses, darting her eyes around the room at the drawings on
the wall, when asked if she enjoys living in a hotel.
   ``I want to go home,'' she says, ``to Kuwait.''
   Her latest drawing shows a mosque. It also shows tanks rolling
down a street, with bursts of smoke coming from the guns, and
Saddam's head on the body of what Alah says is a wolf.
   ``Because he conquered Kuwait,'' is her answer when asked why
she likens Saddam to a wolf. ``He is a bad man who has stolen
Kuwait.''
   She is grinning broadly and tugging at the dress of a friend
when asked what she wants Saddam to do next. ``To die,'' she says.
   Alah was on vacation in Turkey when Iraq invaded her country six
weeks ago. Her father, brother and sister are still there. She
shrugs when asked if she thinks they are safe.
   A friend, 11-year-old Shaimaa, takes a visitor by the hand and
shows her a drawing. It depicts a sword drawn in the colors of the
Kuwaiti flag decapitating Saddam.
   ``The friends of Kuwait will cut his head off,'' she says.
   Does she expect to go home? ``Sure,'' she says. ``When Saddam
dies, I will go back.''

   A set of valleys said to resemble the
animated character Gumby and a meteorite impact crater unlike any
other seen in the solar system are visible in the Magellan
spacecraft's newest pictures of Venus.
   The computer-assembled pictures, released by NASA Monday, were
made from data Magellan collected Saturday as it started its
243-day mission to peer through the planet's thick clouds and map
its rugged landscape.
   ``It's just excitement time. The scientists are in there like
bees to honey,'' said Ed Sherry, a Magellan technical assistant at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   One picture shows a 40-mile-long set of valleys or troughs.
   ``It's a feature we nicknamed Gumby,'' said Steve Saunders,
Magellan's chief scientist, referring to the animated clay figure
from a children's TV show of the 1950s.
   Two valleys, each about three miles wide, look like Gumby's
legs. The north end of the two valleys converge into a single
trough, resembling Gumby's upper body. And the trough ends in a box
canyon that looks a bit like Gumby's head.
   The Gumby-like feature probably formed when underground molten
rock flowed out of the area, causing the ground above to collapse
along fault lines and create the valleys, Saunders said. Similar
features have been seen on Mars, he said.
   Another picture released Monday shows a meteorite impact crater
about five miles wide and seven miles long.
   Large lobes of material ejected by the impact are visible north,
south and east of the crater. That means the crater was formed when
a meteorite slammed into Venus at a low angle, rather than from
directly above, Saunders said.
   Shaped like a kidney, it is unlike any other impact crater seen
in the solar system, NASA said. A possible explanation for the
strange shape is that the meteorite broke into several large chunks
just before it hit, Saunders said.
   Magellan, which was launched from the shuttle Atlantis in May
1989, was to have formally begun its $744 million mapping mission
on Aug. 29, almost three weeks after it went into orbit around
Venus. But engineers temporarily lost radio contact with the
spacecraft on Aug. 16 and again Aug. 21.

<HEAD>Montana is Proud of its Tyrannosaurus Rex</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE DENNISON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOZEMAN, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When trucker Bill McKamey heard that
Montana's Museum of the Rockies had found a Tyrannosaurus rex
skeleton, he offered to make his vehicle and services available any
time, anywhere.
   ``How many times in your life do you haul a dinosaur?'' he
asked.
   The fossil T-rex found in the badlands of eastern Montana is the
largest and most complete skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus ever
discovered. It also is the first of four T-rex skeletons discovered
in Montana that will be staying here.
   That has become a source of pride for people in Montana.
   McKamey, for example, was one of scores of volunteers who helped
bring the fossil of the meat-eating beast from its 65
million-year-old bed in the dry, rugged territory around the
Missouri River to the display room in Bozeman.
   Although the Tyrannosaurus is the best known dinosaur, only
eight have been found - four in Montana, two in Canada and one each
in South Dakota and Wyoming.
   While Montana may be the most fertile hunting ground for the
T-rex, none of the fossils has stayed in the state.
   ``Until this, I didn't realize how many people were upset about
fossils going out of state,'' said Pat Leiggi, chief preparator of
paleontology for the museum. ``A lot of people told me they had a
ranch here and there, and certain people would come and take
fossils out and they never heard about them again.''
   He said that until the Museum of the Rockies opened its
paleontology department eight years ago, the state had no facility
to research the fossils. Now the museum has one of the largest
palentology departments in the country, and it has more of a say.
   ``Now, we know who's doing what,'' he said. ``Montana is in this
network of paleontology departments.''
   The Tyrannosarus rex was the largest carnivore ever to walk the
Earth. It grew to 35 to 40 feet long and up to 12 feet high, with
teeth 6 inches long.
   Museum staffers dug up the 90 percent complete skeleton over
four weeks this summer on federal land near the small farming town
of Circle.
   Army Corps of Engineer engineers built a dirt road into the
remote site and helped load the seven tons of fossils onto trucks.
McKamey was waiting nearby with a flatbed truck and hauled the
bones nearly 400 miles to the museum at Montana State University.
   The fossils, packed in plaster and caked with rock and hardened
mud, then had to be unloaded, weighed and set up for display. But
the museum worried that the floor wouldn't be able to support the
3{-ton pelvic section.
   ``We had a reporter in here and he wrote about it, and the next
morning, we got a whole bunch of calls, saying, `What do you need?'
It sure made my life easier,'' Leiggi said.
   Two state workers helped weigh the pieces, an architect
volunteered to examine the floor, a rental firm loaned dollies, a
construction company loaned a forklift and a driver, and a concrete
casting firm brought in a crane.
   ``We read a little blurb in the newspaper that they needed to
turn (the pelvis) over and that the largest forklift couldn't do
it,'' said Steve Anderson of Bozeman, who operated the crane. ``So
I called them and talked to them. ... It was a chance to see
something really rare.''
   Eventually, the floor was reinforced.
   Museum visitors can watch staffers cleaning and preparing the
bones in a display room, a process that will take many months. The
museum may eventually erect a mold of the skeleton or exhibit the
bones themselves.
   The skeleton was discovered almost two years ago by two amateur
fossil collectors, Tom and Kathy Wankel of Angela. Leiggi said a
call came from the front desk of the museum that someone had some
fossils they wanted identified.
   ``People ask us to identify bones all the time,'' he said. ``To
me it was just another bunch of people who wanted me to look at
their bones.''
   But when curator and chief paleontologist Jack Horner confirmed
that the Wankels had found the arm and hand of a Tyrannosaurus,
``our eyes were just popping out of our head,'' Leiggi said.
   Since the story broke nearly a year ago, reporters, scientists
and dinosaur enthusiasts from around the world have focused their
attention on Montana.
   ``When you find a T-rex, it turns out to be an overnight success
internationally,'' Leiggi said. ``I never expected this.''

<TEXT>
   Gen. Mike Dugan's bluntness was apparent from
the day he testified before a Senate committee judging his
nomination as Air Force chief of staff. In the three months since,
his plain spoken ways became even more obvious.
   On Monday, Dugan was fired by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney for
his frank description of U.S. strategic planning in the Mideast.
   In an interview published a day earlier in The Washington Post
and the Los Angeles Times, Dugan said the military had contingency
plans to ``decapitate'' the Iraqi leadership by targeting President
Saddam Hussein, his family and even his mistress.
   President Bush's national security adviser immediately disavowed
the statement. Cheney consulted with President Bush about firing
Dugan and, by noon Monday, the 53-year-old, decorated ex-fighter
pilot was history.
   His bluntness was apparent in June, when Dugan, then Air Force
commander in Europe, testified before the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
   He told the panel that as the service's European commander, ``I
have been at the `front line' of change and have had the
opportunity to witness and, in some regards, manage its initial
impact on the United States Air Force.''
   The overriding question among lawmakers was the word from the
Pentagon that the Air Force had proposed to Cheney that the
modernization of land-based missiles be delayed.
   Asked if the service had made the recommendation, Dugan replied:
   ``I understand that. I accept that, approve that and I support
that. One needs to look at affordability issues in every regard.''
   Dugan made it clear that the Air Force's No. 1 priority was the
B-2 stealth bomber and that plans to build the single-warhead
Midgetman missile and move the multiple-warhead MX missile from
silos to rail cars could wait.
   In crafting its defense budget, the Senate responded to the
signal from the Air Force, eliminating $1.6 billion in procurement
money for the MX rail-garrison missile program.
   Shortly after taking over from Gen. Larry Welch on July 1, Dugan
began an aggressive campaign to meet with reporters, giving
reporters laminated cards listing his office phone number and the
numbers of his chief aides.
   And he was quotable.
   On Sept. 14, he told reporters in Saudi Arabia that the United
States had two possible courses of action, ``patience and sweat or
... violence and blood.'' He added:
   ``If there's any culture in the world that's impatient, it's
mine, it's the United States.''
   Asked at another time about Soviet military advisers still in
Iraq despite the United Nations embargo on trade with Saddam's
regime, Dugan said flippantly that he was ``more or less satisfied
that the Soviets have decided they are on the same side as us.''
   For weeks, commanders in Saudi Arabia criticized Dugan for his
open assessment of U.S. military capabilities. By last week, even
aides to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin
Powell, were saying that Dugan was among several military officers
who were talking too much about U.S. plans.
   ``Saddam already has you guys giving away the store,'' one aide
told reporters. ``We don't need to help him any more.''
   Dugan, a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point,
flew more than 300 combat missions during the Vietnam war. He
logged 4,500 flying hours.
   Among his decorations: The Distinguished Service Medal, Silver
Star, Purple Heart, Distinguished Flying Cross and the Republic of
Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm.
   Dugan and his wife, Grace Ann have six children. Two - daughters
Colleen and Erin - are Air Force captains.

   Heather Anderson was buried in a pauper's
grave under marker 609 in the city cemetery, laid to rest with her
stuffed animals as tokens of the childhood the 16-year-old never
had.
   Heather, a runaway who didn't run far, lived and died on the
streets of this industrial city of 100,000 south of Boston where
homicides are rare.
   A week ago, an unseen assailant sprayed gunfire at the
teen-ager, her boyfriend and his roommate as they sat on a wall
outside a row of stores. She died in surgery, an artery in her
abdomen severed by a .22-caliber slug.
   Heather, who since age 7 had lived in a successsion of foster
homes here but had been a runaway for nearly a year, was one of
those street children who didn't seem to belong anywhere or to
anyone.
   But at her graveside Friday, it was clear there were many who
cared.
   One of her foster mothers, Mary Hatfield, dedicated a poem to
her: ``How shall we explain the life that slips away like shadows
fading into the black of night? She is not unrecognized. She will
not be unremembered.''
   Hatfield remembered Heather as both charming and difficult.
   ``She was starved for affection. She never knew the potential
she had. She always had to ask, `Do you like me? Am I pretty?' ''
she said.
   ``Heather had been without her family since she was 7,'' said
Heather's aunt, Suzanne Gonsalves. ``She was left at a very early
age. ... It's hard to be a teen-ager when you never got to be a
child.''
   In a eulogy, the Rev. Jeanne Bell said, ``We are overwhelmed by
the tragedy of her violent and cruel death at 16. We think of her
as loving animals and babies. We think of her with a good sense of
humor and a winsome smile.''
   Authorities would not disclose details about Heather's family
history and how she ended up in foster care.
   Her friends said she was tough and self-reliant - or at least
seemed that way. Social workers who tried to help said they were
limited by Heather's resistance.
   ``It's very difficult when a child runs away from a system that
is trying to help,'' said Lorraine Carli, spokeswoman for the state
Department of Social Services. ``It's hard to deal with
adolescents. You can't hold them down in one place.''
   The killing remained a mystery. Police have so far drawn a blank
on suspects.
   Heather was talking with her boyfriend, Jose ``Tony'' Pena, 19,
and his roommate, Gary ``Danny'' Nelson, 26, when someone fired
seven shots in their direction, hitting all of them. Heather
stumbled across the street to a friend's house.
   ``She ran down my driveway,'' said Sara Fonseca. ``She tried to
climb the back stairs but fell.'' As she lay dying, Fonseca said,
``she wanted to tell me something. She wanted to tell me who did it
but she couldn't breathe.''
   ``She had a rough life,'' Fonseca said. ``She always tried to
make jokes about it, and laugh about it, but it really hurt her
inside. All she wanted was for somebody to love her.''
   The two men are recovering from their wounds.
   ``As far as I know, we don't know right now whether it was a
drive-by or if someone walked up to them and shot them,'' said Sgt.
Joe Silver.
   It was the city's second homicide this year.
   Another friend, Laurie Buckley, said Heather was attacked and
beaten with a jagged beer can by two women last month and spent
three days in Brockton Hospital. Police said they had no
information about that incident.
   Heather's foster sister, Judy Darling, said, ``She was a happy
person, she did have a lot on her mind. I've seen kids come and go.
She was one that just stuck in my head.
   ``Heather was trying to get her life straightened out. She
wanted to. She really wanted to.''

<HEAD>USDA Proposes More Reliance on Meat Packers in Beef Inspections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department says it may be
ready to put into use within two years a controversial proposal to
streamline beef inspections, including the notion of putting
greater reliance on packing companies.
   Officials hailed a report by the National Academy of Sciences as
an important step in the development of the experimental inspection
system for cattle slaughter plants.
   The academy's report generally supported adoption of the
Streamlined Inspection System for cattle - called SIS-C - but had
some important qualifications for its approval.
   For example, the report said, if the department does rely more
heavily on private industry to maintain meat quality, the agency
should ``concentrate its resources on safety'' to guard consumers
against microbial and chemical contamination.
   ``The federal government should design its inspection programs
to focus on contemporary health issues,'' the report said. ``It
should insist that industry comply with policies and procedures
required to protect public health and foster public confidence in
the safety of the food supply.''
   Although supporting the speeded-up inspection system for cattle,
the report said the Food Safety and Inspection Service should
develop methods for quickly testing carcasses for microbial and
chemical contamination.
   The SIS-C plan was studied by a panel of the academy's Institute
of Medicine under a $154,000 grant from the department.
   ``From a food safety viewpoint, SIS-C alone is probably no
better, and in some situations can be less effective, than
traditional inspection because the reduced oversight by government
inspectors is not compensated by a total commitment to product
quality on the part of the industry,'' the report said.
   But the report also called the streamlined system ``the most
important change in bovine meat inspection'' since federal
supervision was begun in 1906.
   ``For this system to work in practice, both FSIS and industry
must fully endorse the philosophy of shifting responsibility for
meat quality from FSIS to industry so that the government can
concentrate on safety,'' the report said.
   The plan was officially proposed in November 1988. USDA
spokesman Jim Greene said an amended proposal probably would be
made based on the new study.
   Greene said the department plans to begin using the revised
system within two years, but only in plants that slaughter ``fed''
cattle for the slaughter market. These cattle are mostly
grain-fattened steers and heifers from feedlots.
   The report said about 80 of the nation's more than 1,300
USDA-inspected cattle slaughter plants would be eligible to use the
system. Those account for an estimated 80 percent of the fed cattle
slaughtered for the consumer market.
   Lester M. Crawford, FSIS administrator, said the 11-month study
by the scientific panel ``confirms our ongoing commitment to
modernize inspection at cattle slaughter plants is on solid
footing.''
   Crawford said the report shows the experts agree the proposed
system ``is a single, successful step'' toward an optimal
scientific inspection program that was envisioned by the academy in
a 1985 report to the agency.
   Under traditional inspections, federal inspectors check bile
ducts, heart, cheek muscles and numerous lymph nodes for disease
and other abnormalities. They also are responsible for condemnation
and disposition of diseased carcasses, as well as supervising the
trimming of undesirable parts.
   But under SIS-C, plant employees would incise heart and cheek
muscles, position parts for inspectors and assume responsibility
for some trimming.
   Inspectors still would be responsible for condemnation and
disposition of diseased carcasses, and still would examine every
head, viscera and carcass.
   The streamlined inspection system is currently used
experimentally in five meat plants using high-speed techniques to
slaughter steers and heifers for the beef market.
   Agency officials said those include two Montfort plants, in
Greeley, Colo., and Grand Island, Neb.; two Excel plants, in Friona
and Plainview, Texas; and a National Beef plant in Liberal, Kan.
   The industry's American Meat Institute called the report ``an
objective assessment'' of the new inspection program and said it
may help to end the controversy over the merits of SIS-C.
   Tom Devine of the consumer-oriented Government Accountability
Project, which has helped federal whistleblowers to criticize USDA
inspection operations, said he was ``delighted'' by the report.
   ``It's a gratifying vindication for the concerns raised by
whistleblowers'' who as USDA inspectors alleged there have been
many slipshod, unsanitary practices in plants where the new system
has been used, he said.
   Park Wilde of the Community Nutrition Institute, another
advocacy group, said he had reservations about the academy
committee's conclusions.
   ``The report was produced in a secretive manner, shutting out
the concerns of consumer groups and the inspectors themselves,'' he
said.
   Further, Wilde said a lot of the report's information about the
suitability of SIS-C came from the department's inspection agency
itself. Some of that, he said, included data that consumer
advocates had requested but had not been able to obtain from the
agency.
   Under such circumstances, he said, the report's ``conclusions
have to be (considered) a charade.''

<HEAD>Economists Expect Gulf Crisis Caused Inflation to Double in August</HEAD>

   The turmoil in the Persian Gulf is hitting
American consumers where it hurts - in their wallets.
   Energy prices began soaring immediately after the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait on Aug. 2, crimping consumers' power to purchase other
items and threatening to topple the nation into a recession.
   The government is scheduled today to release its first
assessment of the inflationary damage at the retail level, where it
counts for consumers.
   In advance, most economists were predicting the Labor
Department's Consumer Price Index soared 0.8 percent in August,
double the 0.4 percent rise in July.
   That's the equivalent of a 10 percent annual inflation rate and
would be the steepest monthly increase since January when a cold
snap sent fuel oil and vegetable prices skyrocketing and produced a
1.1 percent overall price rise.
   In a report last week, the department said wholesale prices paid
to producers such as factories and farmers jumped 1.3 percent, the
steepest rise in seven months.
   Georgia State University economist Donald Ratajczak, who
conducts his own inflation surveys, was predicting about two-thirds
of the August consumer price rise would be attributed to energy. He
forecast a gasoline hike of 17 percent and a fuel oil rise of 26
percent.
   Analysts are divided over how long the inflation jolt will last.
Some are predicting the bad news will continue for months as the
inflation works its way into chemicals, plastics and other
petroleum-based products.
   By the end of 1990, the inflation rate for the year will
register at around 6 percent, Ratajczak predicted up significantly
from the 5 percent expected before the invasion and from the 4.6
percent recorded in 1989.
   Others, however, believe the pain will be relatively
short-lived. They say economic growth is too weak to support an
inflationary spiral.
   ``The inflation climate will remain unpleasant for the next
several months,'' economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch said
in a recent newsletter. But ``the economy is extremely weak,
possibly recessionary. Within a year, the inflation rate is likely
to be lower than it was just prior to the oil shock.''

<HEAD>Oklahoma Voters Consider Limiting State Lawmakers' Terms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oklahoma voters decide today whether to
limit state lawmakers' terms, something no state ever has done.
   The proposed constitutional amendment would put a 12-year cap on
service by members of the state House or Senate.
   Supporters argued it would keep incumbents from becoming so
entrenched they no longer worked for the people. Opponents
contended passage would concentrate power in the hands of
non-elected career bureaucrats and lobbyists.
   Oklahoma is the first state to bring such a proposal to the
ballot, said the National Council of State Legislators. Colorado
and California will vote on similar proposals Nov. 6. Similar
legislation has been introduced in Florida and New York.
   There have been no limits on the terms of state or federal
lawmakers since the Constitution superseded the Articles of
Confederation, which had limited House terms to three years out of
every six.
   The Oklahoma proposal got on the ballot through an initiative
petition circulated by Tulsa businessman Lloyd Noble II. He argued
that legislators are so concerned about getting re-elected they
ignore important matters, like waste in government.
   ``All our legislators talk about cutting waste, but they don't
cut any waste that gets them elected,'' Noble said.
   Opponents said voters already can limit lawmakers' terms - by
not re-electing them.
   ``I just basically hate to see any deterioration of the right of
the voters to decide his or her own representatives,'' said Senate
President Pro Tem Bob Cullison.
   Other opponents noted that only 16 members of the 48-member
Senate and 14 of the 101 House members had 12 or more years of
service when the 1990 Legislature adjourned.
   Legislators now in office would be allowed to serve 12 more
years. The ballot measure also provided that the constitutional
provision would not go into effect until Jan. 1.
   Although legislators elected this year will take office in
November, Noble said he believes the 12-year limit would apply to
them.

<HEAD>Analysts: Weakened Economy Could Shrink Expected Growth in Trade
Deficit</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Will be led with report at 8:30 a.m. EDT</NOTE>

   The weakening U.S. economy ironically could
help soften the expected balloon in the nation's merchandise trade
deficit brought on by the oil-price shock of the Persian Gulf
crisis, analysts say.
   The price of oil has soared since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
on Aug. 2, driving up America's energy bill. The United States
imports about 50 percent of its oil consumption.
   But while oil prices are rising, the U.S. economy is slowing,
draining the amount of money consumers have to spend on cars made
in Japan and computers shipped from South Korea. The deficit is the
difference between imports and exports. Thus, trade deficit relief
might be in the offing.
   Oil prices were rising even before the Iraqi invasion, however,
and analysts were looking for today's Commerce Department report on
merchandise trade to see what effect it had on the July deficit.
   Many analysts thought it would top $7 billion. The deficit
totaled $5.07 billion in June, the lowest since June 1983 when it
fell to $3.96 billion.
   ``Higher July imported crude oil prices ... are likely to boost
the oil deficit by about $500 million,'' economists at Mitsubishi
Bank wrote in their current Weekly Economic Indicator Report.
   Michael K. Evans, head of Evans Economics Inc., a Washington
forecasting firm, said oil prices rose between $2 and $3 in July to
about $17 a barrel. They had averaged $14.64 a barrel in June.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. economy is slumping, with growth in the
first half of the year down to an annual rate of 1.2 percent from
2.5 percent in 1989 and 4.5 percent in 1988. Many analysts expect
the business cycle to slide into a recession by the fourth quarter
of this year - if it is not already experiencing one.
   And as the economy grows more sluggish, consumers are growing
more reluctant to spend - not only on American-made goods but on
items imported from overseas as well.
   ``If you look at imports of other commodities (other than
energy), I would expect them to be fairly weak,'' said economist
Cynthia Latta of DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass. ``That should
hold (overall) imports down.''
   For the first six months of 1990, the deficit averaged $7.64
billion a month, compared to $9.12 billion in 1989.
   And before Kuwait, many analysts and government officials were
predicting the deficit would total less than $100 billion this year
for the first time since 1983. Whether that goal can be attained
now is questionable.
   ``Unless we have a recession that really is pretty nasty
cropping up, I wouldn't expect imports to fall sharply enough to
allow us to get anywhere close to that number,'' said Robert
Brusca, chief financial economist with Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc. in New York.
   At the same time, the United States ``will see a slowdown in
export growth because economic conditions are deteriorating
overseas,'' added Lawrence Chimerine, senior fellow at the Economic
Strategy Institute, a Washington research organization.

   The targets lay spread-eagle on a
mound of dirt. Sheldon Smith leveled his 12-gauge shotgun and
gleefully pumped away, aiming mainly for the knees and ankles.
   When the smoke cleared, another set of blue jeans lay crumpled
on the chewed-up embankment, riddled with holes.
   The 24-year-old Smith is a clothing designer. He sells Shotgun
Wash Jeans and is making a fortune. His Jensen-Smith company is
expected to gross more than $1 million this year, selling
shotgun-ventilated jeans for $60 a pop.
   The tiny Chattanooga company made a flashy debut nearly three
years ago with a line of snakeskin-and-denim jackets.
   ``Part of the image we portray is real bold,'' he said. ``It's
almost reckless, like we'll do anything in jeanswear. We got that
attitude when we started in the Western business, because they all
thought we were crazy.
   ``From that time on, we've kind of kept on shaking people up
with crazy things,'' he said.
   Which is why Smith and a couple of employees, loaded down with
shotguns and boxes of blue jeans, recently traveled to a shooting
range on Mowbray Mountain north of Chattanooga.
   ``You guys shoot the knees and ankles. I'll get the rest,''
Smith said as jeans were spread two-deep on the embankment.
   He advised them about different techniques. Stand close, and you
make a nice, solid hole. A few paces back, and the result is an
equally pleasing spray pattern.
   ``If one little pellet hits the zipper, it'll ruin them,'' he
warned. ``Remember, knees and ankles. No crotches or butts.''
   Once the bright new blue jeans are blasted, they are bleached
and washed until they fray. An empty shotgun shell is added as a
tag.
   Smith got the idea after his brother-in-law was wounded in the
hip during a hunting accident. ``He was fine, but he had a hole in
his jeans. My sister would always show people, and they were
fascinated by them,'' he said.
   Sales have been good since Jensen-Smith began marketing the
ventilated jeans about three months ago, even though it's mostly a
gag on the current popularity of ripped denim.
   ``We want to have fun with it for a while, make a statement and
let it run its course, then get back to our normal business - which
is still not real normal,'' he said.

   The Iraqi army has set up camp around the
U.S. Embassy in Kuwait, and tanks have their cannons pointed at the
embassy premises and the nearby Egyptian mission, says a Kuwaiti
who has just fled his homeland.
   The man, his wife, and four sons were among the first to cross
into Saudi Arabia at Khafji. The only border crossing between
Kuwaiti and Saudi territory, it was opened on Saturday for the
first time in a month.
   The man would be identified only as a state technocrat, fearing
reprisals against relatives he left behind.
   He said the Iraqis are rapidly changing the face of Kuwait,
which Iraq's Saddam Hussein annexed after his troops seized it on
Aug. 2, renaming streets and buildings. The Kuwaiti
government-in-exile says Saddam is trying to depopulate the captive
nation and move in Iraqis.
   Even the nine-member puppet government the Iraqis installed in
the oil-rich emirate shortly after the invasion has disappeared,
the man said in an interview.
   ``They've gone with the wind. I heard they hanged Alaa.'' He was
referring to Col. Alaa Hussein Ali, the puppet government's prime
minister. Alaa was last seen by the Kuwaitis via television about a
week after the invasion, being received by Saddam in Baghdad.
   The man said the Iraqi occupation forces were out ``to demolish
anything that has to do with Kuwait or anything to do with ruling
(al-Sabah) family.''
   They pull down street signs as they did on King Khaled Street,
which they renamed Fao Street, he said. The al-Sabah Hospital was
renamed Saddam Hospital. The traffic circle in Kuwait City opposite
the Sheraton Hotel was being dismantled by the Iraqis, who were
preparing to put up a life-size statue of Saddam in its place. the
man said.
   ``It is all becoming Iraqi,'' he said, estimating that only
300,000 Kuwaiti nationals remain behind, with about half a million
having fled.
   He said those remaining behind from the estimated 1 million
expatriates were mainly Palestinians, with some cooperating with
the Iraqis but some hostile to them. ``The Palestinians are split
among themselves,'' he said.
   The man described an armed camp in the embassy district, where
diplomats from more than a dozen countries including the United
States, Britain and Egypt are defying an order by Saddam to leave.
   ``I saw the American Embassy surrounded by the army. Tanks are
around most embassies, including the Egyptian and American, with
turrets and cannons pointed at the embassies,'' he said.
   ``I do not know what is happening inside the embassies, but at
the American Embassy the Iraqis are not allowing anyone in or out,
there is only a one-way man-made path that they control.''
   The man described Kuwait City as a ``ghost city, especially
after dark,'' but said had wanted to stay on ``because it is my
home.'' Then he heard that the Khafji border crossing was to be
opened and decided to try his luck.
   He said Iraqi soldiers had broken into his 65-year-old aunt's
home and searched it while she was on ground in Moslem prayer.
   He said he had been bombarded by tales from relatives and
acquaintances about the Iraqis raping women and burning down the
houses of those they suspected of involvement in the resistance.
   ``I want the world to know that the Iraqis threatened to take my
9-month-old baby boy from the lap of his mother at the border post
if we would not give them our passports, all our identification
papers including car registration,'' said the man.
   ``They insisted they take every document, anything that bears
the name of Kuwait,'' he said. But he also suspected they could be
using those papers to disguise Iraqis for sabotage in various
countries.
   ``The world has to wake up,'' his wife said, almost screaming.
``Military buildup for what if they don't strike at Saddam
Hussein.''
   ``The soldier was pulling my baby from the head and I was
pulling him from the bottom, screaming and crying, his three
brothers in the car also screaming,'' she said.
   She said first they asked whether the baby was a boy or a girl
and when she said boy, one replied: `we have orders to take away
all Kuwaiti boys.''
   Others among the thousands of Kuwaitis who fled their homeland
through the Khafji border crossing after was opened on Saturday
said the Iraqis were rounding up men between the ages of 17 and 35
who were trying to leave.

   Could a generous donation from Bill Cosby be
enough to stave off bankruptcy for his hometown of Philadelphia?
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode is open to offers from the world's highest
paid entertainer.
   ``Maybe the answer to this problem really is to have Bill Cosby
come here and just give us his salary for the next five years and
we could bail our way out of this problem,'' Goode joked in an
interview Monday on the Financial News Network.
   He was responding to a remark by the interviewer, who said the
city's newspapers gave ``bigger play to Bill Cosby's salary than
the problems of Philadelphia.''
   On Monday, Cosby topped Forbes' list of the world's 40 richest
entertainers with two-year earnings projected at $115 million
   Philadelphia projects a $206 million deficit in its $2.1 billion
budget by June, and several banks have refused to guarantee more

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Ol' Blue Eyes is miffed. Now that George
Michael has made it to the top, Frank Sinatra says, he shouldn't
squander his talent by withdrawing from public view.
   ``Come on, George. Loosen up. Swing, man,'' Sinatra wrote in a
letter to the Los Angeles Times a week after the newspaper featured
a complaining Michael.
   ``Here's a kid who `wanted to be a pop star since I was about 7
years old,' '' Sinatra wrote. ``And now that he's a smash performer
and songwriter at 27, he wants to quit doing what tons of gifted
youngsters all over the world would shoot Grandma for - just one
crack at what he's complaining about.''
   In an interview, Michael said he was releasing his new album
without promotional videos or a concert tour and planned to keep
out of public view to reduce the strain of his celebrity status.
   ``Those who who have talent must hug it, embrace it, nurture it
and share it lest it be taken away from you as fast as it was
loaned to you,'' wrote Sinatra, who will be 75 on Dec. 12. ``Trust
me. I've been there.''

   BOSTON (AP) - The case of Charles Stuart, who allegedly shot his
pregnant wife, summoned police to the scene over his car phone and
later killed himself, is the subject of a TV movie starring
``thirtysomething'' actor Ken Olin.
   ``Good Night Sweet Wife: A Murder in Boston,'' will be broadcast
Sept. 25 on CBS.
   The movie was produced in association with Arnold Shapiro, who
was taping a segment of the show ``Rescue 911'' in Boston when
Carol Start was slain Oct. 30.
   Public interest in the crime was heightened by a dramatic,
tape-recorded telephone conversation between Stuart and an
emergency dispatcher who tracked down the Stuarts' location to send
an ambulance.
   The crime shocked Bostonians and aggravated racial tensions,
particularly after a black man was named as a suspect. The crime's
hold on the public imagination grew greater still when it became
clear that the prime suspect was Stuart himself.

   PHOENIX (AP) - Robert Redford has begun shooting ``The Dark
Wind'' on the Hopi and Navajo reservations in Arizona despite
threats of a blockade by leaders of a Hopi village.
   The film is based on a novel by Tony Hillerman.
   Tribal officials gave permission for filming on the reservation,
saying they had been assured by Redford'sproduction company that
the movie would be sensitive to Hopi culture and religion.
   But leaders of the Hopi village of Shungopavi claimed the
script, which was not written by Hillerman, gives a sacrilegious
portrayal of Hopi secret ceremonies and depicts Hopis as inept,
profane, murderous drug users.
   Spokeswoman Bertha Torres said the script's ``underlying theme
was that Hopis are not very bright compared to Navajo people.''
Village leaders want all aspects of Hopi religious beliefs deleted
from the script, she said.
   The village has threatened a blockade, but Hopi police said they
knew of no attempts to disrupt the filming, which began Monday.
   Some Navajos have objected to Redford offering the leading role
of a Navajo policeman to Lou Diamond Phillips instead of a Navajo.
Phillips says he is part Cherokee.

   Ally Milder needs all the help she can get for
her campaign to unseat Nebraska Democratic congressman Peter
Hoagland. But she has no intention of asking Veterans Affairs
Secretary Edward Derwinski for a return visit to Omaha.
   The former Illinois congressman said Monday that Milder's
concern was ``understandable'' in the aftermath of his reference to
illegal aliens as ``wetbacks,'' a remark he conceded was ``a dumb
mistake.''
   ``There's no place in government for people who have attitudes
like this,'' said Milder, who said it was up to President Bush to
decide whether the remark was enough to force the Cabinet secretary
to resign.
   ``We're not going to comment,'' said White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater.
   Milder wouldn't discuss the incident which occurred Friday
morning and stirred an unwanted controversy over the weekend.
   ``That's certainly not the way she feels in the least sense of
the word,'' said Kent Grisham, a spokesman for the Nebraska
Republican Party. ``I think she made an interesting point that
being Jewish she has experienced a lot of prejudice first-hand.''
   Riccardo Correa, an Omaha businessman who is active in Hispanic
affairs, said Derwinski's remark had not altered his long-standing
support for Milder.
   Correa said her apology was ``not for people like me but for
people who would use this against her.''
   Hoagland won the Omaha congressional seat in 1988 by a margin of
fewer than 3,000 votes, succeeding Republican Hal Daub who ran for
the Senate.
   Howard Schloss, spokesman for the House Democratic campaign
committee, called the Hoagland-Milder contest ``a very tight race''
and he relished the opportunity to link Milder to Derwinski.
   ``It showed very bad judgment on her part to even invite him out
there in the first place,'' he said. Calling Derwinski
``insensitive not only to minorities but to women,'' Schloss said
Milder ``brought him out there regardless of his views on these
matters.''
   Derwinski aides confirmed published reports that the Cabinet
secretary often refers to women on his staff by nicknames such as
``Little Miss Coffee Maker,'' ``Zsa Zsa,'' ``Little Miss Muffett''
and ``Lena.'' He also has nicknames for several male aides.
   Derwinski said the nicknames were part of his policy of running
``a completely informal office.''
   He called it ``just one of my efforts to have one great big
happy family on my staff.''
   Derwinski aides refer to him as ``The Big Cheese.''
   Sandy Peyton, a program assistant at the Department of Veterans
Affairs, said Derwinski calls her ``Miss America,'' and ``I don't
mind at all being called that.''
   Peyton said there was ``a good warm atmosphere'' in the office
and that the women employees ``were all livid'' to read a story
suggesting they were offended by the secretary's habit of giving
them nicknames.
   Derwinski said his use of the term ``wetback'' was ``just one of
those dumb slips ... that law of averages you have them, I guess.''
   He said he used the term during a breakfast meeting when he was
asked what his department was doing to combat drugs.
   ``I just volunteered that one of the problems with drugs is
they're so easy to smuggle and that therefore curing addiction in
the long run was the way we had to go,'' he recalled. ``And then I
just got so carried away with my subject that without even thinking
of exactly what I said, I said the drug cartel even uses wetbacks
to get drugs into the country.''
   He said he hadn't realized what he said and ``the first
opportunity I apologized ... I said, obviously, it was a dumb
mistake. ... It was an inadvertent, almost unconscious comment.''

   Ally Milder needs all the help she can get for
her campaign to unseat Nebraska Democratic congressman Peter
Hoagland. But she has no intention of asking Veterans Affairs
Secretary Edward Derwinski for a return visit to Omaha.
   The former Illinois congressman said Monday that Milder's
concern was ``understandable'' in the aftermath of his reference to
illegal aliens as ``wetbacks,'' a remark he conceded was ``a dumb
mistake.''
   ``There's no place in government for people who have attitudes
like this,'' said Milder, who said it was up to President Bush to
decide whether the remark was enough to force the Cabinet secretary
to resign.
   ``We're not going to comment,'' said White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater.
   Milder wouldn't discuss the incident which occurred Friday
morning and stirred an unwanted controversy over the weekend.
   ``That's certainly not the way she feels in the least sense of
the word,'' said Kent Grisham, a spokesman for the Nebraska
Republican Party. ``I think she made an interesting point that
being Jewish she has experienced a lot of prejudice first-hand.''
   Riccardo Correa, an Omaha businessman who is active in Hispanic

<DATELINE>AQABA, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Persian Gulf crisis has cut short the
economic boom of Jordan's only port and main tourist resort.
   Beaches normally packed with tourists are deserted. Aqaba's
wide, tree-lined boulevards and once-crowded shopping malls have
become the haunt of stray cats searching vainly for scraps of food.
   Until Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and the resulting turmoil
in trade throughout the Middle East, Aqaba was Jordan's fastest
growing city and had a bright future.
   ``But now tourism is dead, the port is at a practical standstill
and so is business in general,'' bemoans Bassam Kakish, president
of the Aqaba Region Development Authority.
   Thewalls of Kakish's office are lined with colored architects'
drawings of the tourism and other development projects along the
sandy beaches and crystal-clear waters of the Red Sea.
   The port has been severely affected because 70 percent of its
business was Iraqi imports and exports and that trade has been
killed by the U.N.-ordered embargo on trade with Iraq in
retaliation for its seizure of Kuwait.
   Aqaba, with an estimated population of 45,000, is near Jordan's
southern tip, sandwiched between Saudi Arabia and Israel; it sits
next to the Israeli resort city of Eilat.
   Only two or three ships a day dock in the port, compared with
more than 20 before the crisis. More than 7,000 of the 11,000
Jordanian trucks engaged in hauling goods to and from the port have
been idled, Kakish said.
   ``Thousands of people have been flung out of work - dockers in
the port, truck drivers and hundreds more providing auxiliary
services. This has brought business in town to a virtual
standstill.''
   In the tourist sector, Kakish said, ``Aqaba catered to 150,000
European tourists last year and this year we expected even more. We
were actually 5,000 beds short.
   ``All the local hotels are expanding and new ones are under
construction. Yet now all the hotels are empty, and this is the
beginning of the high season,'' he said.
   Hoteliers confirmed that with the outbreak of the crisis guests
began leaving, fearing the region would be engulfed in a war.
   ``The only guests we have now are the occasional journalists
that come down from Amman to visit the port and see how the
sanctions are implemented,'' said a receptionist at one of the main
hotels who gave his name as Mohammed.
   ``We've had hundreds of cancellations, and future bookings have
dried up,'' he said.
   Kakish estimates that Aqaba will lose more than $1.2 billion
from the combined collapse of its tourism and port business. No end
is in sight to the falloff, which Kakish believes is unfair since
Jordan is abiding by U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
   ``People talk without reason of Jordan as a war zone,'' he said.
``When will they regain confidence? How long will this period of
uncertainty continue - one or two months, one or two years?''

   Here is a chronology of events in the
political career and drug case of District of Columbia Mayor Marion
Barry:
   1974: Barry, a civil rights activist, is elected to the D.C.
City Council.
   1976: Barry is re-elected to the council.
   March 9, 1977: Hanafi Muslims shoot Barry in the chest during
their seizure of the District Building, the capital's city hall.
The bullet barely misses Barry's heart, but he's back at work a
week later.
   November 1978: Barry is elected mayor.
   January 1979: Barry is inaugurated, pledges that ``here in
Washington D.C., we will be our brother's keeper.'' During his
first term, the city deficit mushrooms, forcing him to cut jobs and
services and press for more federal aid. He weathers a major
snowstorm and a drawn-out teacher's strike.
   November 1982: Barry is re-elected. His second term sees
improved fiscal health, renewal of the downtown area, a decline in
unemployment and crime. Scandals begin to take their toll as 10 top
city officials are convicted of financial crimes.
   Sept. 25, 1983: Barry is stricken with chest pains while
attending a meeting in a downtown hotel; hospital officials blame
the episode on a hiatal hernia. A physician not involved in his
treatment tells police the mayor suffered a drug overdose, a report
not revealed for six years. Police say they could find no evidence
to support the physician.
   Nov. 4, 1986: Despite his mounting troubles, Barry is re-elected
to an unprecedented third term, taking 61 percent of the vote.
   1987:
   Jan. 26: Vacationing in California, Barry is hospitalized
briefly after suffering chest pains, later explained as a flare-up
of the hiatal hernia.
   May 22: U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova announces a federal
investigation into allegations of fraud in city government.
   June 18: Barry denies a local television station's report that
he used cocaine with a former city employee.
   1988:
   Dec. 22: Police officers planning to attempt a drug buy from
Charles Lewis, a former Virgin Islands official and acquaintance of
Barry's, are called back when it's discovered that the mayor is in
Lewis' hotel room. Traces of cocaine are found in the room.
   Dec. 29: U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens announces plans to
investigate Lewis episode.
   Dec. 31: Barry apologizes for ``bad judgment'' in the incident.
   1989:
   Jan. 5: A grand jury investigating allegations of Barry
interference in a police drug probe has the mayor's telephone logs
subpoenaed.
   Jan. 6: Lewis denies ever using drugs with the mayor.
   Jan. 19: Barry appears under subpoena before the grand jury and
testifies for three hours. He tells reporters he has done nothing
wrong.
   April 24: Lewis is convicted in the Virgin Islands on four
counts of possession of cocaine.
   Sept. 17: Barry responds to hecklers at an outdoor festival by
making an obscene hand gesture.
   Nov. 6: Lewis pleads guilty in a plea bargain in Washington to
two counts of conspiring to distribute cocaine and names Barry as a
person for whom he bought crack cocaine while staying at the hotel
where Barry visited him in 1988.
   1990:
   Jan. 18: Barry is arrested on a drug charge in a downtown hotel.
   Jan. 21: Barry announces he will seek assistance ``to heal my
body, mind and soul,'' but makes no mention of drug abuse.
   Jan. 22: Barry checks into Hanley-Hazelden Treatment Center in
West Palm Beach, Fla. His spokeswoman says the mayor will be
treated for alcoholism.
   Feb. 15: A federal grand jury indicts Barry on three felony
counts of perjury and five misdemeanor counts of possession of a
controlled substance.
   May 10: The grand jury indicts Barry on six more misdemeanor
possession charges.
   June 4: Jury selection begins in Barry's trial.
   June 13: Barry announces he will not seek re-election.
   June 19: Opening arguments at the trial.
   June 28: The jury is shown a videotape in which Barry smokes
crack cocaine from a pipe during the January FBI sting operation at
a Washington hotel.
   Aug. 2: The case goes to the jury after closing arguments.
Prosecutors say jurors should convict a man who ``smoked and
snorted his way through 1987 and 1988 ... right into 1989.'' The
mayor's lawyer says the jury should disbelieve witnesses he calls
``facile liars.''
   Aug. 10: The jury convicts Barry of one drug possession charge,
acquits him of another and says it is deadlocked on the other seven
misdemeanor and three felony charges. The judge declares a mistrial
on the unresolved charges.
   Aug. 13: Barry changes his political affiliation from Democrat
to independent.
   Aug. 28: He files petitions that would allow him to run as an
independent for the city council.
   Sept. 17: Federal prosecutors say they will not retry Barry on
the 12 charges.

<HEAD>Ford Says No Recall Warranted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. says it is not recalling light
trucks for gear shift repairs because there is no safety hazard if
the levers break. That decision is drawing fire from a consumer
advocacy group.
   The Center for Auto Safety, founded by Ralph Nader, asked the
government Monday to order a recall of 240,000 Ford Ranger pickups
and Bronco II utility vehicles from the 1986 and 1987 model years.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched an
investigation in June of reports that the manual transmission
levers were breaking off in the driver's hand.
   ``Ford's approach to such a blatant, widespread defect is
woefully inadequate,'' said Samuel Cole, vehicle safety staffer for
the consumer organization.
   Ford provided the government agency with a September 1988
internal report that disclosed 6,473 gear-shift lever failures on
1986 and 1987 Ranger pickups with manual transmissions made by
Mazda.
   That translates into a failure rate of one in every 37 vehicles,
the Center for Auto Safety said.
   The Bronco II has the same transmission as the Ranger, Ford
spokeswoman Joy Stinson said. Ford began using an improved lever
assembly with 1988 models.
   Ms. Stinson said the company did not consider the problem a
safety hazard. Even if the lever breaks, the vehicle remains in
gear and the driver is able to pull off the road without losing
control, she said.
   ``Whatever gear it breaks in, it's driveable,'' she said. ``For
that reason ... a safety recall is not warranted.''
   Cole disagreed, saying that ``it will only be a matter of time
before we begin seeing accidents attributed to the gear shift
defect.''

<HEAD>Hinckley Loses Bid to Vote in DC Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The board of elections in the District of
Columbia has ruled that presidential assailant John W. Hinckley Jr.
cannot vote in the city where he has been confined since the
shooting of then-President Reagan more than nine years ago.
   In a petition arguing his right to vote, Hinckley claimed that
he had resided and paid taxes in the District and should have been
given the right to vote in the upcoming general election.
   But after a hearing Monday, the board concluded that a person
involuntarily confined cannot change his address to the
jurisdiction where he is being held.
   Hinckley, charged with the attempted assassination of the
president, was found innocent by reason of insanity in 1982 and
since has been confined at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington
D.C.

<HEAD>California Businessman Pleads Guilty to Bribery for Navy Contracts</HEAD>

   A California businessman has pleaded guilty to
conspiring to bribe two Navy procurement officials. Manuel R.
Caldera admitted to paying the military officials more than $26,000
to help his company obtain lucrative electronics contracts.
   Caldera, 59, former chairman of Amex Systems, Inc., of Los
Angeles, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to pay bribes and making an
illegal payment to a public official.
   Together, the charges carry a maximum sentence of seven years
imprisonment and fines of $500,000.
   The guilty plea before U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton in
Alexandria, Va., marked the latest conviction in the government's
investigation of Pentagon procurement fraud.
   Thirty-nine defense consultants, procurement officials and
contractors plus several companies have been convicted since the
investigation known as ``Operation Ill Wind'' became public more
than two years ago.
   Caldera, a Mexican-American who was honored in 1983 by President
Reagan as a minority businessman, admitted paying bribes to former
Navy procurement officals Stuart E. Berlin and James D. Sampson
between 1978 and 1985.
   The two former officials, who worked for the Naval Electronics
System Command in Arlington, Va., agreed to approve additional
contract work for Amex in return for the money, according to court
papers.

<HEAD>Loyalists Set Fires, Air Attacks Reported in Liberia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Liberia's civil war has entered a
new phase of chaos, with encircled government soldiers setting huge
fires around the capital and Nigerian jets bombing a rebel army,
news reports and military sources say.
   Clouds of smoke hung over the ravaged capital, Monrovia, on
Monday as rival rebel forces under Charles Taylor and Prince
Johnson battled each other and loyalists of slain President Samuel
Doe with artillery and machine guns.
   There were no immediate reports on casualties.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. said from Monrovia that Doe
loyalists doused buildings with gasoline, setting huge fires that
burned out of control.
   ``No Doe, No Liberia. No President, No Capital,'' it quoted the
soldiers as chanting. The BBC said the remnants of Doe's army have
decided to go down fighting, expecting no mercy from insurgents who
have been hunting them down since Doe died this month in rebel
hands.
   The rebels control most of the country and have confined
government holdouts to a section of Monrovia.
   Military sources in Lagos, the Nigerian capital, said Monday
that that country's jets had bombed strongholds of rebel leader
Charles Taylor.
   The reports of those attacks Sunday were the latest indication
that West African nations, who said they were sending a joint
military force to Liberia to restore peace, were instead becoming
more involved in the fighting.
   Over the weekend, Ghanaian warplanes also bombed Taylor's forces
in retaliation for shelling that killed five people on a ship and
at the West African force's headquarters in Monrovia.
   Herman Cohen, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for Africa,
met in Sierra Leone with Gambian and Nigerian officials to discuss
a possible visit Wednesday to Monrovia. The State Department said
Cohen's schedule had not been finalized.
   Nigeria sent 650 troops to Freetown, Sierra Leone, where they
were waiting to board warships bound for Monrovia. They are to join
1,000 Nigerian troops already participating in the 3,000-member
regional force, which also includes troops from Gambia, Ghana,
Guinea and Sierra Leone.
   The new Nigerian contingent includes paratroopers. Military
sources said they would be dropped into the port of Buchanan,
southeast of Monrovia, and Kakata, north of the capital.
   Both are held by Taylor, who is opposed to the West African
force. He has seized 2,000 West African citizens as hostages.
   The rival rebel leader, Johnson, has welcomed West African
intervention and its call for an interim government followed by
elections.
   Members of the West African force, and many Liberians, have
criticized the United States for not sending troops to end the
8-month-old war. At least 5,000 people have died in the fighting,
most of them civilians.
   The war began in December when Taylor invaded from the Ivory
Coast. Prince Johnson, a former Taylor ally, formed a rival force
over the summer.
   The rebels claimed Doe's government was corrupt and mismanaged,
but the conflict has largely been fought along tribal lines.
   ``We've got to a stage where really we have to think deeply on
what to do to bring a very bad, very confused and violent situation
to an end,'' said Gambian President Sir Dawda Jawara, the chairman
of the Economic Community of West African States.
   About 2,100 U.S. Marines have evacuated hundreds of foreigners.
They are also guarding the U.S. Embassy and residential compound in
Monrovia, but they have orders not to intervene militarily.
   Liberia was founded by freed American slaves in 1847.

   After four failures, NASA gave up
trying to launch the leaky space shuttle Columbia so that it can
concentrate on getting Discovery aloft in October before the
planets fall out of the proper alignment.
   NASA scrbbed the fourth attempt to launch Columbia about seven
hours before it was to lift off at 1:28 a.m. today after a buildup
of hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, was detected in the engine
compartment during fueling.
   A baffled Robert Crippen, shuttle director, said: ``I do not
understand it. Our plan is that we are going to understand it.''
   Columbia was to have lifted off with the $150 million Astro
observatory to study some of the hottest objects in the universe.
   Driven by the need to launch Discovery next month, NASA ran out
of time and patience with Columbia. The Discovery mission has
priority: its crew is to launch the Ulysses space probe toward the
sun during an alignment of Earth, sun and Jupiter that won't
reoccur for 13 months.
   Another effort to launch Columbia is not likely before November,
if then, NASA said.
   Columbia's crew of seven, which includes four astronomers, was
to head back to Houston today.
   Three of Columbia's scrubs were for hydrogen leaks; the fourth
was because of a problem communicating with one of the four
telescopes Columbia was to carry on a 10-day astronomical mission.
   The latest failure only added to what has been a difficult year
for NASA. It means that nearly six months will have gone by without
a shuttle flight if Discovery goes in October, the longest gap
between missions since flights resumed after the Challenger
disaster.
   The space agency planned on nine missions this year; so far it
has had only three.
   This also has been the year when the Hubble Space Telescope was
found to have blurred vision and when the Magellan spacecraft
orbiting Venus twice slipped its communications bonds with Earth.
   ``I believe that we still have people out there who are capable
of solving this kind of a problem,'' Crippen said. But he added,
``We certainly haven't done this in a very expeditious manner, I
know that.''
   Engineers had not decided on the next step, which probably will
involve installing cameras and lights in Columbia's engine
compartment and going through the tanking procedure again. Crippen
said there may be three or more leaks.
   After a fueling attempt on May 29, when the first hydrogen
buildup occurred both outside the shuttle and inside the engine
compartment, NASA focused on a plumbing connection between the fuel
tank and the shuttle. A similar leak was found in Atlantis,
prompting NASA to ground the three-shuttle fleet temporarily.
   Engineers determined that microscopic glass beads somehow worked
their way into Columbia's seals and provided a path for the leaks.
The connecting pipe was replaced, but on Sept. 5 hydrogen flooded
the aft compartment again.
   NASA replaced three small pumps and a damaged Teflon seal over a
valve.
   Now, Crippen said, the leak may have had ``something to do with
us going through, taking things apart,'' after Columbia returned
from its last mission in January with some systems contaminated
with an abrasive used to polish metal.

<TEXT>
   Authorities ordered all packets of M&amp;Ms candy
withdrawn from Hong Kong stores today after an anonymous letter
claimed one bag of the candy had been poisoned to punish the U.S.
manufacturer for co-sponsoring the Asian Games in Beijing.
   The letter, delivered to several newspapers late Monday, says
one packet of M&amp;Ms had been laced with sodium cyanide, a deadly
poison.
   The letter condemns Mars. Inc. of Hackettstown, N.J., which
makes M&amp;Ms, for sponsoring the games, which open in Beijing on
Saturday.
   It criticizes China's Communist leaders for their bloody
crackdown on a movement for democracy in China in June 1989.
Hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed then when the military
cleared central Beijing of protesters.
   ``M&amp;M chocolates, which called itself the official sponsor of
the Games, is guilty of supporting the illegal regime,'' the letter
said.
   Peter Maslen, a spokesman for the Effem Foods Co., which makes

<HEAD>S&amp;P Lowers Philly Bond Rating</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. has dropped
Philadelphia's bond rating ``about as low as you can go,'' and
Mayor W. Wilson Goode appealed to the state for help in solving the
city's deepening fiscal crisis.
   The Legislature must recognize that Philadelphia ``is the
heartbeat of this commonwealth'' and give the city the authority to
raise taxes, Goode said Monday.
   ``I think that had New York City not raised taxes by nearly $1
billion this past year it would be in the same position that we are
in right now,'' he said.
   The bond rating agency downgraded its rating on Philadelphia's
$1.3 billion of general obligation bonds Monday to the weakest
credit rating short of default. Moody's, another national bond
agency, took similar action on Friday.
   ``You can't lower it any more,'' said Hyman C. Grossman, S&amp;P
managing director. ``It's about as low as you can go.''
   The credit rating makes it more difficult and more expensive for
the city to borrow money.
   Philadelphia, starved for revenue because of the economic
downturn in the Northeast, has been trying to sell $375 million in
short-term notes but has found no banks to guarantee them.
   City Finance Director Betsy Reveal has said that without an
infusion of cash, Philadelphia will be out of money by the end of
the year or shortly thereafter.
   The Goode administration Monday ordered a one-week freeze on new
spending, prohibiting hiring, executing new contracts and buying
supplies. Reveal also instructed city department heads to defer
payments if possible.
   The reduced rating - to triple-C from triple-B-minus - will stay
in place until there is a ``solid, credible plan to restore
Philadelphia's fiscal posture to a level where it can meet all of
its financial obligations,'' Standard &amp; Poor's said in a statement.
   During an appearance on Financial News Network on Monday night,
Goode said the city had to find more revenue.
   ``I think you have an option,'' he said. ``You can cut your way
out of this problem and therefore cut your services to a point
where nobody wants to be around because your services are so far
gone you can't resolve any problems.
   ``On the other hand you have to have sufficient revenue to
maintain the quality of life,'' he said.
   Grossman said the city needs a special tax to pay its debt, in
return for which it will have to give up some of its authority.
   ``The time is long gone,'' he said. ``There is no access to the
(credit) market.''
   He said he hopes the rating sends a ``message to the city and
the state that together they need to construct a mechanism to
enable the city to begin to address its chronic financial
distress.''

<HEAD>Gorbachev's Referendum Call: Democracy or Morass?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's unexpected call
for a referendum on ending collectived farming indicates he is now
having second thoughts about pushing ahead with a compromise plan
to create a market economy. Gorbachev's proposal to put to the
people whether to allow private ownership of land came Monday as
Parliament opened debate on competing plans for salvaging the
shortage-plagued and grossly inefficient economy.
   Gorbachev, speaking to Parliament, did not say when the
referendum would be held, who would vote, or where he personally
stood on the issue.
   He is apparently reluctant, either personally or politically, to
part with six decades of Communist Party ideological opposition to
private ownership of land, said Professor Murray Feshbach of
Georgetown University in Washington.
   ``Gorbachev just can't bring himself to turn in his party
card,'' Feshbach said in a telephone interview.
   Soviet peasants were coerced into collectivization and all land
became state property during a 1929-1932 campaign led by Josef V.
Stalin that is believed to have claimed the lives of between 5
million and 10 million people.
   The debate in the legislature Monday turned tumultuous as
delegates and economists rose to attack parts of all three economic
reform proposals presented in the past week.
   The compromise supported by Gorbachev was criticized by
supporters of both the other plans, and the chances of a broad
consensus appeared dim.
   The most radical proposal - known as the Shatalin plan for its
principal author, economist Stanislav Shatalin - would in 500 days
give land back to farmers, sell factories to private owners and
move the Soviet Union toward a free market.
   It would shift most economic authority from the central
government to the increasingly separatist republics and deprive the
national government of the right to levy taxes.
   A more conservative proposal, supported by Prime Minister
Nikolai Ryzhkov, would retain central control over the economy and
move more slowly toward a heavily regulated market.
   Gorbachev on Friday presented the compromise plan, written by
Shatalin and another leading Soviet economist, Abel Aganbegyan. It
contains many elements of Shatalin's radical 500-day plan but would
move at a slower pace and not disturb the central government's
power to levy taxes.
   The compromise proposal also backs away from private ownership
of land. While Shatalin's 500-day plan calls for selling some land
to individuals for nominal prices, the compromise calls for leasing
it.
   Gorbachev has urged a compromise to avoid a split with the
parliament of the Russian Federation, the largest of the 15 Soviet
republics with half the country's people and three-quarters of its
land.
   The Russian parliament overwhelmingly adopted Shatalin's 500-day
plan last week.
   Thousands of people marched through Moscow on Sunday to demand
the resignation of Gorbachev, Ryzhkov and the Council of Ministers
for failing to solve the country's economic problems.
   Gorbachev rejected the calls Monday, saying reshuffling ``the
top echelons of power ... would draw us into grim political
battles, (and) would heighten confrontation in society at a time
when we most badly need consolidation to carry out the market
economy program.''

   Boston University's hard-bitten president battled
a former attorney general for the Democratic nomination for
governr today after a wild campaign that saw an attempted coup
against retiring Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   In the nation's other gubernatorial contest, both parties in
Oklahoma had runoffs for candidates to succeed Republican Henry
Bellmon. He, too, decided not to seek re-election.
   Two political newcomers enlivened Oklahoma's Republican
campaign, and the GOP race in Massachusetts took a surprising turn
this month. But the Massachusetts Democratic race has been the most
heated and, at times, bizarre. Turnout was expected to be huge.
   Earlier in the race, polls had shown John Silber, on leave as BU
president, running neck-and-neck with former state Attorney General
Francis Belloti. Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy had lagged badly in
fund-raising and in the polls.
   Then Murphy tried to grab control of the state's ailing finances
from Dukakis while he was on a European trade mission earlier this
month.
   What Republican candidate Steven Pierce dubbed ``mutiny on the
Titanic'' wound up sinking Murphy's campaign. She withdrew from the
race and threw her support to Bellotti, though her name remains on
the ballot.
   Silber, a 63-year-old philosopher, gained a reputation for
outspokenness as BU president for 20 years. He didn't tone down his
style in making his first bid for public office.
   The ``Silber shocker'' that may have caused the biggest furor
came when he suggested during a debate that the state may want to
ration health care. ``When you've had a long life and you're ripe,
then it's time to go,'' he said.
   Last week, asked about giving a crime control speech in an
inner-city neighborhood, Silber said there was no point addressing
``a group of drug addicts.''
   Silber criticized the news media for focusing on such remarks
and not the substance of his speeches.
   Bellotti called Silber ``irrational'' and ``intemperate.''
   A poll taken for WBZ-TV and The Boston Globe and released Sunday
showed Bellotti leading Silber 50 percent to 39 percent. The poll
by KRC Communications Inc. surveyed 696 likely Democratic primary
voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage
points.
   The GOP race had been relatively sleepy until this month, when
polls indicated former federal prosecutor William Weld overtook
Pierce, the state House Minority Leader.
   Weld spent more than $1 million of his own money on the
campaign. He also debated aggressively.
   The Globe-WBZ poll of 682 likely Republican voters showed Weld
with 51 percent to Pierce's 41 percent, with a 4-point margin of
error.
   All four remaining candidates all have pledged to turn around
the state's deficit-ridden budget and an economy marked by rising
unemployment and loss of businesses.
   The Massachusetts economy has been sliding since Dukakis won the
Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and then lost the
general election that year.
   In Oklahoma, the GOP runoff will end a hotly contested race for
the gubernatorial nomination between businessman Vince Orza and
former U.S. Attorney Bill Price. Both are political newcomers.
   The Democrats were 1986 nominee David Walters and U.S. Rep. Wes
Watkins.
   A big issue in the Republican race has been education. Price
advocates repeal through a statewide vote of the $223 million
education reform bill enacted earlier this year. Orza has aids that
would be a mistake that would hurt the state's image nationally. He
said he would work to change the measure.
   Watkins and Walters have taken similar stands on most issues.
   Oklahoma voters also were deciding whether to limit state
lawmakers' terms. It would be the first time any state enacted such
a limit. If approved, it would put a 12-year cap on service by
members of the House or Senate.
   In Washington state, former Gov. John D. Spellman was trying an
unusual political comeback. The Seattle attorney, an affable,
pipe-puffing Republican moderate, wanted a seat on the state
Supreme Court.
   He was challenging Justice Richard Guy, who was appointed last
fall by Gov. Booth Gardner, the Democrat who ousted Spellman in
1984.

   Diplomats gathered today for a new General
Assembly new session in an atmosphere of unprecedented cooperation
among leading powers but unremitting tension over Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait.
   ``The United Nations finally is achieving the purpose which was
envisaged by its founders, and it is becoming a far more
influential actor on the world stage,'' Ronald I. Spiers,
undersecretary-general for political and General Assembly affairs,
has said.
   The 44th General Assembly closed its final meeting Monday with a
unanimous appeal to South African authorities to suppress the
violence that has killed nearly 800 blacks the last six weeks.
   The 45th General Assembly was to convene today for its first
post-Cold War session. The assembly is expected to be dominated by
the Persian Gulf crisis and economic development, debt and the
environment.
   At today's gathering, the new assembly was expected to elect as
its president by acclamation Guido de Marco, deputy prime minister
and foreign minister of Malta.
   The position rotates among regional groups each year. It is
largely ceremonial, but the president has power to arrange the
agenda and mediate among various interest groups.
   The annual general debate and speeches by world leaders begin
Sept. 24, when President Bush is to address the 159-nation
assembly. He is to be followed by 27 heads of state, 18 prime
ministers and more than 100 foreign ministers. The assembly
convenes at a time when the prestige of the organization never has
been higher because of a series of tough Security Council
resolutions condemning Iraq's seizure of Kuwait and ordering an
embargo on trade with Iraq.
   It also comes during unprecedented U.S.-Soviet cooperation and
harmony between those two countries and the other three permanent
members of the Security Council: France, Britain and China.
   The General Assembly, often likened to a global town meeting,
cannot adopt legally binding resolutions, as can the Security
Council. But its increasingly unified voice carries considerable
weight as an expression of will of the international community.
   Monday's resolution on South Africa noted that country's
progress over the last year, such as freeing Nelson Mandela and
other political prisoners, and lifting the ban on the African
National Congress and other organizations.
   South Africa's voting rights in the General Assembly have been
suspended since 1974 for its refusal to abolish apartheid.
   The new session will admit Liechtenstein as the 160th U.N.
member, but the reunification of East and West Germany on Oct. 3
and its membership with a single U.N. seat will keep the membership
at 159.
   The Cambodian seat, previously held by the anti-Vietnamese
coalition of Democratic Kampuchia, is to be filled by a member of a
provisional government being formed to organize elections under
U.N. auspices. Details of a Cambodia settlement and U.N.
administration remain to be worked out.
   ``This is the first post-Cold War General Assembly,'' Spiers
said.
   He said he expected the Middle East and especially the Persian
Gulf crisis to be recurrent themes in speeches by world leaders,
but he emphasized that the ``great issues'' of today and years to
come are Third World debt and development, poverty, the
environment, narcotics and other social issues.
   Except for the Middle East and the Persian Gulf crisis, few
contentious issues remain on the U.N. agenda, as the Soviet Union
seeks to end its involvement in regional conflicts and cooperate
with the United States.
   But Cambodia, Western Sahara, Afghanistan and Cyprus remain
trouble spots and unresolved conflicts.
   At a time when the United Nations is called upon as never before
to make peace, it remains far in financial arrears, largely because
the United States owes more than $700 million.
   For years, the United States withheld funds because it said the
world body was biased against the United States and tilted in favor
of the Soviet Union and the Third World.
   Bush has asked the U.S. Congress to restore funding, however.

   The Northeast shivered in record early-morning cold today.
   Rain was forecast today for the mountains of New England, some
of which were sprinkled with snow on Monday. Rain also was expected
in the Midwest, and Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin were in for more
cool weather.
   Rain also was forecast for Texas along the lower coastal areas,
although portions of the area flooded by rain since Saturday were
expecting drier weather.
   Temperatures dipped below freezing overnight as far south as
Virginia.
   Isolated thunderstorms were forecast for the southern Rockies,
but most of the far West - from Washington to Arizona - looked for
dry, seasonable weather.
   Thunderstorms overnight in Colorado produced golf ball size hail
at Haswell and 2{ inches of rain, causing minor flooding.
   The high for the nation Monday was 107 degrees at Borrego
Springs, Calif.

   A teen-ager trying to avenge his mother's
mugging was charged with manslaughter in the fatal stabbing of her
assailant.
   Victor Lopez, 18, tracked Lazara O'Farrill to a drug-plagued
park and stabbed him three times, hours after his mother, Maria
Lopez, 37, was mugged early Saturday in the South Bronx, police
said Monday. Lopez was jailed on $5,000 bail.
   ``A lot of people hurt for what happened to him,'' said Lopez's
aunt, Mildred Maldonado. ``He was incarcerated for defending his
mother.''
   A tourist from Utah was killed earlier this month when he tried
to defend his mother from muggers on a subway platform.
   Lt. Michael Bramble said he saw Lopez's situation differently.
   ``Basically, someone took the law into their own hands. Instead
of coming to the police, they acted irrationally and emotionally,''
he said.
   O'Farrill, 25, died at a hospital after being stabbed in the
chest, arm and leg, authorities said.
   Maria Lopez talked her son into surrendering after two area
teen-agers were arrested and charged with the slaying. ``I believed
it wasn't right,'' she said. ``I told him there's no need to be
hiding.''
   ``I feel guilty,'' sobbed Mrs. Lopez, a single mother who said
she struggled to keep her nine children away from trouble in a
drug-plagued neighborhood. ``If I hadn't called my son, this
wouldn't have happened.''
   Mrs. Lopez was mugged as she walked to the subway on her way to
work as a nurse's aide at a hospital. She was approached by two
men, one of whom grabbed two gold chains from her neck and put his
hand down her blouse to see if she was carrying any money in her
bra.
   ``I screamed, I was nervous, I called 911, then I followed one
of them,'' she recounted. Mrs. Lopez also called home and told her
sons Victor and Raymond, 21, what had happened. ``I never knew a
killing would happen,'' she cried.
   She went to work while her sons found one of the muggers, who
told them he only tagged along when O'Farrill mugged their mother
to buy crack, police said.
   The sons found O'Farrill at a drug-plagued park. As they
approached him, he swore at them and ``tried to pull something from
his waist and that's when my son stabbed him in the arm,'' Mrs.
Lopez sobbed.
   Victor Lopez told his mother he was too scared of O'Farrill to
try to hold him until police came, Mrs. Lopez said.
   Mrs. Lopez said O'Farrill belonged to a neighborhood gang known
as ``Los Machoteros,'' or the machete-wielders, who mugged women
and children.

   The dollar was mostly lower against major
currencies in European trading this morning.
   Gold was marginally higher.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 137.68 yen, up 0.68 yen from
Monday's close. Later in London, it was quoted at 137.55 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   -1.5540 German marks, down from 1.5575
   -1.2890 Swiss francs, up from 1.2865
   -5.2045 French francs, down from 5.2160
   -1.7535 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7550
   -1,163.00 Italian lire, down from 1,165.00
   -1.1585 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1593
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9115, compared
with $1.9025 late Monday.
   ``Life insurance companies and securities houses bought (pounds)
sterling and marks against the yen, so the dollar-yen (rate) was
pushed up,'' said Tadashi Sazaki, assistant general manager in the
foreign exchange and international treasury department at Mitsui
Taiyo Kobe Bank.
   Short-covering lifted the dollar to its high for the day before
life insurance companies began buying the U.S. currency, sending it
back down again toward the end of trading, he said.
   Dealers in London said a surge in oil prices has undermined the
yen. Meanwhile, interest in the dollar and the German mark remain
low, prompting some investors to drift into high-yielding
currencies, such as the Canadian dollar and the British pound.
   Many more players are simply bailing out, said Richard Wemsley,
senior dealer at Fuji Bank in London. ``People are pulling out left
right and center,'' he said.
   ``The market's gone into its shell,'' agreed Richard Longbourne,
senior dealer at First City Texas Houston in London.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$390.55 per ounce at midmorning, up from $389.75 bid per ounce late
Monday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $389.30, up from $389.00 late
Monday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $2.48 an ounce today, to close at
$389.85.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $4.81 a troy ounce,
from $4.78.

   A man questioned about a forest fire in
which a helicopter pilot died shot himself to death after leaving a
three-mile trail of orange ribbon leading to his body.
   Lester W. Stensgar, 33, of Inchelium, whose body was found
Friday on the Colville Reservation, also apparently set two small
blazes nearby before killing himself, authorities said Monday.
   Stensgar had admitted setting fires on the Indian reservation in
1988 and 1989 but denied responsibility for a 915-acre arson fire
last week in which a Canadian pilot died, investigators said.
   FBI agent Jeffrey John said the agency had questioned Stensgar,
a nephew of Tribal Business Council Chairman Jude Stensgar, and
evidence was to have been presented to a grand jury today.
   John Dick, acting reservation police chief, said Stensgar had
stretched orange ribbon nearly three miles from a road to the spot
where his truck and body were found.
   A note was found at the scene, but investigators would not
disclose its contents.
   Two small fires were burning nearby, tribal spokeswoman Sheila
Whitelaw said. The fires burned a tree stump and some brush, she
said.
   Robert Wiebe, 54, of British Columbia, died when his helicopter
crashed into a ravine while he was dropping 200-gallon buckets of
water on the arson fire last week. The blaze started Sept. 10 and
was declared controlled Sunday.

<HEAD>Tropical Storm Marie Closes in on Hawaii Island</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tropical Storm Marie, downgraded from a
hurricane, moved today toward Hawaii. Residents were advised to
prepare for winds of up to 73 mph.
   Hurricane Marie was downgraded late Sunday after its top
sustained winds fell from 85 mph to 70 mph. A storm must have
sustained winds of 74 mph to be classified a hurricane. Marie's
winds still gusted to 85 mph, the National Weather Service said.
   Marie storm was 210 miles southeast of Hilo on Monday night,
heading for Hawaii at 9 mph, forecasters said. If it stays on the
same course, the storm center would pass 130 miles south of South
Point on Hawaii, known as the Big Island, this afternoon,
forecasters said.
   A tropical storm warning, meaning winds of 39 mph to 73 mph were
possible, was posted for Hawaii Island. A tropical storm watch was
posted for Maui County, including the islands of Maui, Molokai and
Lanai. There were no warnings for Oahu Island, where Honolulu is
located.
   Gale-force winds, ranging from 39 to 54 mph, extend 140 miles
from the center, the weather service said.
   High surf kicked up by the storm hammered the east and south
shores of Hawaii Island, prompting the closing of Punaluu Beach
Park with surf on Monday ranging from 8 to 10 feet where it
normally averages 1 to 2 feet, said County Civil Defense
Administrator Harry Kim.
   The southeast section of the island was already experiencing
some strong gusty winds Monday, blowing debris onto some roadways,
Kim said.
   There were no reports of any property damage related to the surf
or wind, he said.

   The United States acknowledged today
that the days of a large U.S. military presence in the Philippines
are numbered, and asked for time to phase out its oldest and
largest bases abroad.
   ``It is clear to me ... that the days of a very large presence
of U.S. sailors and airmen in the Philippines are coming to an
end,'' chief American negotiator Richard Armitage told the opening
session of talks on the bases' future.
   ``What remains for us to determine is the rate at which this
presence will be reduced and the nature of the relationship our two
governments wish to pursue during and after this transitional
period.''
   It was the first time a U.S. official had publicly raised the
possibility that Washington is prepared to give up the six bases.
   The talks continue negotiations begun in May on the future of
Clark Air Base, Subic Bay naval base and four smaller
installations. Their lease expires in September 1991, and
Philippine opposition to the installations is growing.
   On Monday, a bomb exploded at a Voice of America relay station
60 miles north of Manila, and Communist rebels claimed
responsibility in a statement, saying they were protesting U.S.
``domination'' of the Philippines.
   There were no injuries, and U.S. officials said damage was
slight.
   The talks are being held in the Central Bank building, guarded
by more than 1,500 police and soldiers. About 1,000 leftist workers
and students rallied near the bank today to protest the bases but
dispersed peacefully after police refused to allow them to march to
the site.
   At least 17 people were arrested and 14 injured during
anti-bases protets in Manila on Monday.
   U.S. diplomats have said in the past that U.S. troops will
remain in the Philippines only as long as they are wanted.
   On Monday, however, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
said Washington wants to keep its bases in the Philippines.
   In his comments today, Armitage did not propose a timetable for
removing the 40,000 troops, Defense Department civilians and
military dependents. But he hinted that the process could extend
until the end of the century.
   He said the U.S. and Philippine military, Filipino base workers
and other nations in the region need time to adjust to the possible
closing of the bases.
   ``Let the voters of the 21st Century decide whether or not they
believe a continued U.S. presence will be helpful,'' Armitage said.
   Rafael Alunan, spokesman for the Philippine negotiators, said
Manila welcomed Armitage's ``willingness ... to discuss the
crafting of a new relationship between our two countries.''
   But he took exception to Armitage's call for voters of the next
century to decide on the American presence. ``This matter is not to
be decided in the 21st century,'' Alunan said. ``The time for
decision is now.''
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, chairman of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs, said Friday that U.S.
officials were considering a 10-year phaseout.
   Last month, Manila newspapers quoted unidentified sources as
saying the Philippines was considering allowing the Americans to
remain in Subic for up to 10 years if they returned Clark and the
other installations in 1991.
   Opponents believe the bases infringe on national sovereignty and
represent a vestige of American colonial rule, which ended with
independence in 1946. U.S. forces have been in the Philippines
since the Americans captured the islands from Spain in 1898.
   During a nationally televised speech Monday, President Corazon
Aquino said her government wants to maintain close ties with
Washington. But she said the end of the Cold War and absence of any
external threat to the Philippines made the bases less important.
   ``It is now necessary for our government to work with the United
States for arrangements regarding the orderly withdrawal of their
forces from our country,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
   She noted that a government committee is drafting plans to
convert the bases into civilian use, including a commercial airport
at Clark and a ship repair facility at Subic.
   The United States has strongly supported the Aquino
administration since a 1986 revolution ended the 20-year rule of
the late President Ferdinand Marcos, a longtime U.S. ally.
   In December, U.S. jets from Clark flew air cover for government
forces during an unsuccessful bid by military rebels to oust Mrs.
Aquino.
   American troops from the bases also provided help for the
government during a July earthquake that killed nearly 1,700
people.

   Former state Sen. Paul Carpenter faces
up to 80 years in prison after being convicted of shaking down
political lobbyists for campaign contributions.
   The 62-year-old Democrat from Long Beach, once a powerful figure
in the state Legislature, was found guilty on racketeering,
conspiracy and extortion charges stemming from a 5-year-old FBI
investigation at the Capitol.
   He is the second California elected state official convicted on
corruption charges. Joseph Montoya, a Democrat who was convicted in
February while still a member of the state Senate, is serving a
6{-year prison sentence for racketeering, extortion and money
laundering.
   Carpenter, who served 12 years as a state senator and was a
Senate Democratic Caucus chairman, is expected to appeal, said his
attorney, Gerard Hinckley.
   Sentencing was not immediately set for Carpenter, who for
several years was one of the Senate's leading fund-raisers.
   He faces a maximum of 80 years in prison and $750,000 in fines.
He also risks losing his seat on a powerful state tax board. He is
up for re-election to the Board of Equalization in November.
   The jury deliberated for nearly two days before reaching
verdicts on Carpenter, who was indicted in March. The charges arose
from alleged wrongdong before Carpenter left the Legislature to
join the tax board in 1987.
   They centered around $20,000 in campaign contributions that
Carpenter received in 1986 from an FBI undercover agent posing as
an Alabama businessman.
   The prosecution contended the money was a payoff to ease passage
of a bill the businessman was sponsoring, supposedly to obtain
financing for a shrimp plant in the Sacramento area.
   Carpenter acknowledged he took some steps that could have been
interpreted as helping the bill. However, he contended that he did
nothing for the bill in exchange for the money, saying he had been
assured by an aide that the businessman agreed Carpenter could take
the contributions without any strings attached.

   A man who tried to extort $30,000 from a
local anchorwoman to block publication of nude photos that did not
exist was sentenced to five years in prison.
   ``He's a leech,'' KTLA-TV anchorwoman Jann Carl said after
Superior Court Judge Jacqueline Connor imposed the maximum penalty
on Gilbert Cabot.
   A jury last month convicted Cabot, 44, of attempted extortion
and conspiracy in connection with the 1988 plot.
   Prosecutors described Cabot as a veteran con artist.
   They said Cabot called Carl and told her a woman planned to sell
nude photos of the anchorwoman to a national magazine. Cabot said
the photos were taken from a sexually explicit videotape, and that
he could block their publication by paying the woman $30,000,
prosecutors said.
   Carl, knowing the video did not exist, went to the police, who
netted Cabot in a sting operation.
   Defense attorney Rowan Klein contended Cabot did not attempt to
extort money.

   Former President Reagan lectured Moscow university
students today on the virtues of capitalism, democracy and religion
- and said he'd be following the same course as Mikhail S.
Gorbachev if he were Soviet leader.
   During the question-and-answer session at Moscow State, Reagan
also said he believes ``Germany has rejoined the civilized world''
and will not repeat Nazi atrocities.
   Reagan, in the Soviet Union at Gorbachev's invitation, said,
``We should be teaching our students the languages of each others'
countries so that we can really cement the friendship.''
   ``If young people like you, in the world, could get to know each
other, there would never be another war,'' he said in the
conference room of the university's mammoth administration
building.
   Reagan went to the campus accompanied by U.S. Ambassador Jack
Matlock.
   During his remarks, the former president mused about Gorbachev's
job.
   He said that if he were suddenly catapulted into the Soviet
presidency and faced with the crumbling Soviet economy, he would
act just as Gorbachev is.
   ``I'd be doing the things that President Gorbachev is trying to
do to bring about private ownership, to bring about the free
economy. ...,'' he said.
   Gorbachev's economic reform proposals were among the topics the
two discussed in the Kremlin on Monday, including the possibility
of a Soviet referendum on ending farm collectivization.
   A key to the reform, Reagan said, is a person's right to own
land.
   ``Until you've done so, you can't realize the patriotism and the
pride that you have when you can stand on a piece of land and say
`this is mine,''' Reagan told the group.
   Asked how he maintained his psychological fitness during eight
years in the White House, Reagan quoted another former president,
Abraham Lincoln:
   ``He said at one point that he could not perform the duties of
his office for 15 minutes if he did not know that he could call
upon one who was wiser and stronger than all others,'' Reagan said.
   ``He was speaking, of course, of God. I learned while I was in
the White House why he said that. I discovered that I had that same
need.''
   On Monday, Reagan, who used to call the Soviet Union an ``evil
empire,'' urged those in the country's breakaway republics to keep
cool heads.
   Visiting for the first time since leaving office, the former
president made his appeal while speaking to lawmakers of the
national parliament.
   ``Freedom can bring out passions between groups of people that
may boil over,'' he said in a reference to the recent Soviet
reforms. ``When they do, cool and calm decisions are called for by
leaders, so as to lower temperatures all around.''

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell
for the fourth day today, dropping at one point to its lowest level
of the year because of worry over high oil prices and the Middle
East, traders said.
   The dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues plummeted in the
morning, falling at one point to 23,308.31, its lowest level this
year. It then climbed back in the afternoon to finish trading at
23,884.82, down 480.78 points, or 1.97 percent, from Monday's
close.
   The index's previous low for the year was 23,405.71, reached
briefly on Sept. 7.
   The Nikkei index fell 531.86 points, or 2.13 percent, on Monday.
   Stock traders said the same group of influences - high oil
prices, rising interest rates and pessimism over the stalemate in
the Middle East - discouraged investors today as on the previous
three days.
   Also fueling the decline was an article in the respected
economic newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun which suggested that
long-term interest rates would be raised. Japan's official discount
rate has been raised five times since May last year.
   The price of benchmark Brent crude oil for November delivery was
valued this afternoon at around $33.53 a barrel, up from $32.30 a
barrel in New York late Monday.
   Prices for Dubai crude soared at one point to an eight-year high
of $31.10-31.20 a barrel, the highest level since November 1982,
Kyodo News Service said.
   Volume on the stock market's first section was estimated at a
moderate 400 million shares.
   ``There just weren't any buyers out there,'' said Chip Mesics,
an equity salesman at Kidder Peabody International Corp.
   Traders said index arbitrage trading and the weak bond market
sent stocks down steeply in the morning, but the Nikkei index
headed up in the afternoon when major trading companies began
buying up issues to support the market.
   The release in the afternoon of money supply figures, which were
close to expectations, also helped pull the market back up from its
morning fall, said Kazuhiro Nomura of New Japan Securities Co.
   Japan's broadly defined money supply, M2 plus certificates of
deposit, expanded by 11.9 percent in August from a year earlier,
the Bank of Japan announced. In July, the figure was 12.2 percent.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar finished trading at
137.68 yen, up 0.68 yen from Monday's close. The U.S. currency
opened at 137.17 yen and ranged between 136.95 yen and 138.10 yen.
   ``Life insurance companies and securities houses bought (pounds)
Sterling and (German) marks against the yen, so the dollar-yen
(exchange rate) was pushed up,'' said Tadashi Sazaki, assistant
general manager in the foreign exchange and international treasury
department at Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank.
   Short-covering lifted the dollar to its high for the day before
life insurance companies began buying the U.S. currency, sending it
back down again toward the end of trading, he said.
   The yield of benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government bonds
closed at 8.540 percent, down from Monday's 8.565 percent finish.
Their price closed at 81.29 points, up from Monday's 81.19 points.

   Flowing black robes have no place in the
courtroom of Circuit Judge John Ashworth.
   In Raleigh County Circuit Court, Ashworth wears a red robe at
Christmastime, for weddings and occasionally, as he puts it, ``just
for the devilment of it.''
   But his favorite robe is electric-blue.
   ``I really don't like a black robe,'' he said. ``Why should you
wear a black robe when you have so many other colors to choose
from?''
   His colorful taste extends to his regular wardrobe. He recently
came to work in a lilac suit with matching suspenders and bow tie.
   He also favors hats, including a straw hat that he rarely is
seen without during the spring and summer.
   ``I usually remember to wear a hat wherever I go,'' said
Ashworth, who is known to friends as ``the Mad Hatter.''
   ``I've got about 15 straw hats, three derbies, felt hats, wool
caps and even a hat from Australia,'' he said.
   Lawyers say Ashworth's eccentricity livens up his courtroom.
   ``It adds a little color to the courtroom,'' Beckley lawyer John
Wootin said. ``I think it's a nice change.''
   Ashworth does own a black robe, but not the kind the hangs to
the floor.
   ``I had the sleeves altered so they're not in my way, and the
bottom shortened,'' he said. ``I like my sawed-off one very much.
... It can't get caught in my chair.''

<HEAD>New Orleans Teachers' Strike in Second Day; No End in Sight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teachers union leaders and rank-and-file
members prepared for a long siege in their strike for improvements
in pay and other benefits.
   ``This is a solid strike,'' said Nat Lacour, president of the
United Teachers of New Orleans, which represents most of the 4,500
teachers in the state's largest school system.
   Lloyd Daly and his wife, Mary, both teachers and veterans of the
last New Orleans teachers' strike 12 years ago, said they will walk
the picket lines ``as long as it takes.''
   School system figures indicated that 68 percent of the 4,500
teachers failed to report to work Monday. The union claimed the
number was greater than 80 percent. A spot check of principals
indicated most of the 84,000 students attended classes Monday.
   No new contract negotiations were scheduled.
   When negotiations broke off during the weekend, the teachers
union reverted to its original demand for a $45 million package
including 10 percent raises each year of a three-year contract.
   On the first day of school Sept. 4, teachers voted to postpone a
strike and limit their demands primarily to better health insurance
benefits and raises for clerical workers and teacher aides.
   On Saturday, the union made a new proposal, asking for $1
million to improve health benefits and agreeing to wait until later
in the year for raises for aides and clerical workers. But the
board rejected that, sticking to its offer of $600,000, union
leaders said.
   Then on Monday, the School Board cut the $600,000 offer in half.
   Frank Fudesco, an associate superintendent and the board's chief
negotiator, said the $300,000 pulled back would have come from the
school system's self-insured workers' compensation fund.
   ``We cannot give what we do not have,'' Fudesco said.
   Sixth-grade teacher Katy Hall, picketing at Lafayette Elementary
School, said the teachers are ``not striking just for money. ...
We're looking for professional respect.''
   In 1978, New Orleans teachers struck for 12 days, returning
after they were promised a 7 percent pay raise.
   Most money for teachers' pay comes from the state, which now
pays $14,472 for a starting teacher with a bachelor's degree and
$25,737 for one with a doctorate and 25 years of experience, said
W.J. Cleveland of the state Eduction Department. The state
increased its share 7 percent this year.
   Some poor rural parishes don't add anything to that. Cleveland
estimated that the average parish supplement is $3,500.
   New Orleans adds $4,983 to a starting salary and $9,374 at the
top of the scale, so that starting teachers get $19,455 and someone
with a doctorate and 25 years of experience gets $35,111.
   About 650 teachers' aides, who make about $10,000 a year, and
450 clerical workers, who make about $17,000, also are covered
under the contract.

<DATELINE>KHAFJI, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kuwaiti refugees trickled across the
border to Saudi Arabia today, their numbers sharply decreased after
Iraqi troops began seizing young men from among the thousands
wanting to leave a day earlier.
   Since Iraq unexpectedly opened the border Saturday for the first
time in more than a month, about 6,000 refugees have entered Saudi
Arabia.
   By mid-morning today, 100 cars had arrived at the Khafji border
crossing in Saudi Arabia. Passenger said about 300 were waiting on
the other side of the checkpoint, the only frontier crossing
between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
   More men under the age of 40 were grabbed as cars were picked to
leave the country in a haphazard manner, the refugees said. The
seizures began Monday with the Iraqis taking away men between the
ages of 17 and 40 and sending them north in buses.
   A man who said he was 55 years old related how four men in their
20s were taken at gunpoint from his car as he approached the
frontier today. He said he had not heard of the seizures the day
before; otherwise he would not have brought the young men.
   ``I didn't get the news,'' he repeated, staring at the ground.
He would not give his name.
   Some Kuwaitis said the young men would be forced into the
military, others said they will be interned in Iraq. There was no
explanation given to the men or their travel companions when they
were seized.
   Today, Iraqi soldiers were allowing one car to cross into Saudi
Arabia every 10 minutes. Six checkpoints on the 120-mile route from
Kuwait City to the border eliminated the possibility of random
escapes, the refugees said.
   In Kuwait, the refugees said, police and military officers, as
well as any of the Westerners still left in Kuwait, were the
particular targets of manhunts. They said the new Iraqi-appointed
governor of Kuwait, Ali Hussein Abdel-Majid, had previously been in
charge of eradicating Kurdish resistance in northern Iraq.
   Iraq was widely condemned for using outlawed chemical weapons in
the crackdown on the rebellious Kurds in 1988.
   Iraq annexed Kuwait six days after invading it on Aug.2. Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein then declared the emirate Iraq's 19th
province, and appointed Abdel-Majid its governor last week.
   One Kuwaiti who fled his homeland said the Iraqi army has set up
camp around the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait, and tanks have their
cannons pointed at the embassy premises and the nearby Egyptian
mission.
   The man, his wife, and four sons were among the first to cross
into Saudi Arabia at Khafji. The man would allow himself to be
identified only as a state technocrat, fearing reprisals against
relatives he left behind.
   He said the Iraqis are rapidly changing the face of Kuwait,
renaming streets and buildings. The Kuwaiti government-in-exile
says Saddam is trying to depopulate the captive nation and move in
Iraqis.
   ``It is all becoming Iraqi,'' the refygee said. He estimated
that only 300,000 Kuwaiti nationals remain behind, with about half
a million having fled.
   The man described an armed camp in the embassy district, where
diplomats from more than a dozen countries including the United
States, Britain and Egypt are defying an order by Saddam to leave.
   ``I saw the American Embassy surrounded by the army. Tanks are
around most embassies, including the Egyptian and American, with
turrets and cannons pointed at the embassies,'' he said.
   ``I do not know what is happening inside the embassies, but at
the American Embassy the Iraqis are not allowing anyone in or out,
there is only a one-way man-made path that they control.''
   The man described Kuwait City as a ``ghost city, especially
after dark.''
   The refugees were not being allowed to leave Khafji while their
documents were being checked. The Saudis are worried about
infiltration of spies and provocateurs.
   Refugees were transported to air-conditioned schools where they
were to be fed and housed until they had all been processed,
officials said.

<TEXT>
   Fireworks and balloons filled Atlanta's morning
sky today when the International Olympic Committee announced the
city will be the site of the 1996 Summer Olympics.
   Pandemonium broke out at the downtown retail-entertainment
complex called Underground Atlanta, where thousands of people
gathered to watch the announcement over televisions broadcasting
the IOC meeting live from Tokyo.
   Bright orange and green fireworks lighted the sky even though
the sun had already risen when the news came about 7:50 a.m. The
boom of the fireworks could be heard throughout downtown.
   A band played the Olympic theme, and strangers hugged each
other.
   ``This was exciting. This was unbelievable,'' Mayor Maynard
Jackson said at a news conference in Tokyo just after the vote.
``This proves that if you don't run the race, you don't have a
chance to win.''
   ``It's not my victory, it's a victory for Atlanta,'' said former
Mayor Andrew Young, who helped lead the campaign for the Olympics.
``We have to thank God and pray that we are worthy and that all of
the things that we have said, we can make come true.'' He also was
in Tokyo.
   Atlanta entered the race late by most standards - in 1987 - with
nine volunteers. Some cities spent more money on the bids; for
example, Athens spent nearly $30 million compared with Atlanta's
$750,000. And some spent more time: Belgrade entered the race in
1985.
   To win, a city needed 44 votes from the 88-member IOC.
   The committee's choice basically came down to the history and
tradition of Athens or the 21st century stadiums, communications
and commercial appeal of its rivals, which also included Belgrade,
Yugoslavia; Manchester, England; Melbourne, Australia, and Toronto.
   According to a study done jointly by an accounting firm and the
University of Georgia, the Games would pump $3.5 billion over six
years into Georgia's economy, add 85,000 jobs and create global
exposure.
   ``It made me feel I was making the Olympic team again,'' said
Evander Holyfield, the former Olympic boxer who is from Atlanta.
   Seconds after the announcement, crowds in Atlanta were six-deep
at an Atlanta Organizing Committee cart selling T-shirts and hats
with the city's Olympic logo.
   In the minutes before the announcement, the crowd alternated
between nervous silence and good-natured jeers as IOC President
Juan Antonio Samaranch fumbled with the card holding the name of
the host city.
   ``I wanted this so bad,'' said Janice Stockard of suburban
Decatur. ``I wanted it because Atlanta's great. This means a lot.

   ``I am absolutely amazed. I can't believe Atlanta has gone from
a place nobody thought had a chance to really getting those
games,'' said Michael Lomax, chairman of the Fulton County
Commission.
   Afterward, many in the crowd headed for work, but others hung
around to scoop up the last remaining souvenirs and to get started
on an all-day party planned for Underground Atlanta.

   Columbia, NASA's oldest and most
delayed shuttle, has been grounded three times in four months by
hydrogen leaks and once by payload problems.
   Columbia set the record for the most launch delays in January
1986, when it was delayed seven times before a satellite delivery
mission.
   So far this year, only three shuttles have flown. NASA
originally planned nine missions for 1990, but now is hoping for
six.
   The following is a chronology of this year's shuttle flights and
Columbia's delays since May:
   Jan. 9 - Columbia lifts off on a mission to retrieve a
scientific satellite. The flight had been scheduled for Dec. 18,
but its launch pad was being refurbished and not ready. Bad weather
delayed a Jan. 8 launch attempt.
   Feb. 28 - Atlantis is sent on a secret military mission
following five delays due to bad weather and the commander's cold.
It was one delay short of tying the second-place record for launch
postponements.
   April 24 - Discovery is launched with the Hubble Space
Telescope. An April 10 launch attempt had been halted with four
minutes to go because of a faulty valve in a hydraulic power unit.
   May 29 - NASA called off Columbia's May 30 launch attempt after
hydrogen leaked during fueling. It was the first countdown for the
astronomy mission.
   Aug. 30 - NASA halted Columbia's second countdown, canceling a
Sept. 1 launch attempt, because of a failed electronic part on one
of four telescopes inside the shuttle.
   Sept. 5 - NASA called off Columbia's Sept. 6 launch attempt
after hydrogen flooded the aft compartment during fueling.
   Sept. 17 - NASA scrubbed the Sept. 18 attempt after a hydrogen
buildup was detected in Columbia's engine compartment.

<HEAD>Tamil Fire Kills Two In Battle Around Sri Lankan Fort</HEAD>

   Tamil rebels pounded a government fort
with homemade mortars, rockets and machine guns, killing two
policemen and wounding three soldiers, military officials said
today.
   They said army sharpshooters picked off 27 Tamil Tiger rebels in
surrounding bombed-out buildings and underground bunkers during
battles around 17th century Jaffna Fort.
   On Monday, the military evacuated the 200-member garrison that
had defended the fort during a three-month rebel siege, airlifting
it to medical facilities in outposts in the northern Jaffna
Peninsula. They left behind 300 other men who had earlier broken
the rebel siege on the fortress.
   A defense ministry communique said 28 men have been killed and
more than 140 injured since Aug. 22, when a major operation was
launched to relieve the government soldiers holed up in the fort.
   The latest casualties, which occurred Monday, included a pilot
whose plane crashed into a lagoon when it failed to pull out of a
attack dive against a rebel gun position. The rebels claimed they
downed the plane with a SAM-7 missile.
   The officials also said the Tigers were using a new incendiary
mortar shell.
   ``It is a nasty firebomb. It explodes and sets everything ablaze
in a tremendously wide radius when it hits its target,'' said one
official, speaking under standing rules of anonymity.
   The military said it has been consolidating positions and
inching out of the star-shaped fortress towards Jaffna town, across
a few hundred yards of no-man's land.
   The Tigers say they still have the fort surrounded and have
beaten back some reinforcements.
   The Dutch colonial fortress is the only government stronghold in
the rebel-held town 185 miles northeast of Colombo. It is the
political and military base of the rebels, who seek a Tamil
homeland independent of the Sinhalese-dominated government.
   In the eastern Ampara district, police commandos on a search and
destroy mission shot dead four rebels and discovered a field
hospital near the Kanjimadichiaru village, north of Ampara town,
the military officials said.
   In northeastern Trincomalee, troops also killed seven rebels in
a clash at a rebel camp near the Sri Lankan naval dockyard, the
officials said.
   At least 14,000 people have been killed in the insurrection,
which broke out in 1983. Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people, accuse the Sinhalese of discrimination.
Sinhalese constitute 75 percent of the population of this island
off the southern tip of India.

<HEAD>Government Accused of Suppressing Report Implicating Libya in
Bombing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year after a French airliner was blown up over
the Sahara, killing 170 people, the government stands accused of
suppressing a report that implicates Libya.
   The UTA DC-10 exploded Sept. 19, 1989, over Niger en route from
Brazzaville, Congo, to Paris. The victims included the wife of the
U.S. ambassador to Chad and a Chadian Cabinet minister.
   According to the French news magazine Le Point, investigators
have determined that three Congolese dissidents carried out the
bombing on the instructions of Libyan agents.
   French officials have refused to comment on the article or a
subsequent report in The Times of London that said Syria, as well
as Libya, had been implicated.
   The Times said France is withholding the findings of the
investigation because it does not want to upset relations with
Libya and Syria at this point in the Persian Gulf crisis set off by
Iraq's takeover of Kuwait.
   The investigation of the bombing has been headed by Judge
Jean-Louis Bruguiere, one of France's leading experts on
international terrorism.
   He reportedly briefed President Francois Mitterrand on his
findings in early August, about the time of the Iraqi invasion.
   The inquiry gathered momentum after search teams, working in
scorching desert heat, retrieved the victims' remains and aircraft
debris that were scattered over 150 square miles of moonscape
terrain in central Niger.
   Investigators reassembled the plane in a hangar outside Paris
and eventually concluded that the bomb exploded inside a Samsonite
suitcase loaded aboard the DC-10 in Brazzaville.
   According to Le Point, investigators identified the probable
chief suspect as Apolinaire Mangatany, listed as boarding the plane
in Brazzaville.
   Investigators reportedly suspect that Mangatany got off the
plane during a stop in N'Djamena, Chad. Only 105 of the bodies of
the victims were positively identified, and Mangatany's was not
among them.
   In January, according to Le Point, Congolese security officers
arrested one of Mangatany's associates, Bernard Yanga, and learned
the identity of a third possible accomplice.
   Yanga, whose current whereabouts are unknown, rportedly
recounted how the bombing was planned under the guidance of a
Libyan Embassy staff member identified as Abdallah Elazrag. Yanga
reportedly said the motive was to punish France for supporting Chad
in its war against Libya.
   Two other possible motives have been suggested - retaliation for
perceived French aid to Christian forces in Lebanon's civil war or
an attempt to kill exiled Libyan opposition leader Yusuf
al-Magariaf.
   According to Le Point and The Times, al-Magariaf decided at the
last minute not to take the flight.
   The government plans a memorial service Wednesday in Paris in
honor of the victims, but some relatives are upset by the handling
of the inquiry.
   Claude Peinchaud, whose daughter died aboard the plane,
expressed his anger to the newspaper Le Figaro last week.
   ``We have the right to know all the results of the inquiry,'' he
said.
   ``It's essential that they tell us who the masterminds are and
that those responsible are caught and punished. Too bad if this
doesn't suit the government.''

   A former autoworker living in a rented
mobile home since he was laid off has stepped forward to claim his
one-sixth share of Florida's $106.5 million lottery jackpot.
   A woman who last week set up a legal partnership with 11
relatives and friends in case they won also had her winning ticket
verified Monday.
   The holders of the four other tickets good for a share of the
nation's second-largest lottery jackpot remained unknown as of
midmorning today, said lottery spokesman Ed George. The winners
have six months to come forward.
   Each winner will get $17.75 million, before taxes, over 20
years, or $887,500 a year. The winning numbers were drawn Saturday
night.
   One winner was Richard J. Piasecki, 58, a car-body repairman. He
and his wife moved to a mobile home in New Smyrna Beach after he
had to take early retirement from Chrysler when its Kenosha, Wis.,
plant closed in 1988. He had worked for the automaker for 32 years.
   Piasecki and his wife, Jeanne, plan to split their winnings with
their daughter and son.
   The daughter, Mary Jo Bednarski, met her husband with the news
by running into the driveway of their Wisconsin home in her
bathrobe yelling, ``We're rich! We're rich!''
   Piasecki and his wife plan to buy a small home with a little
land, as well as a bigger motor home and a boat. Mrs. Piasecki also
said the they plan to travel throughout the United States.
   Mrs. Bednarski, 34, said she is quitting her job at Hardee's and
that she, her husband and their four children might move to
Florida.
   The other winner who came forward Monday, Kathy Smith of
Longwood, also said she'd share her newfound wealth with family
members and friends. Legally, she has to.
   Her brother, Scott, a Tampa accountant, came up with the idea of
creating a legal trust in case they won. He and the others - mostly
relatives - signed the formal agreement last week. The group bought
50 tickets.
   Ms. Smith will get one-fourth of the $17.75 million share. Her
brother and his wife will get another 25 percent, and Ms. Smith's
mother and stepfather will get another quarter. Seven others will
split the final 25 percent.
   Ms. Smith said she would not quit her job as a nurse in a
doctor's office because she loved her work. The 34-year-old woman
said she would buy a car and some land for horses.
   She said when she realized Sunday morning she had a ticket with
all six numbers, ``I shook so bad I dropped the ticket.''
   Pennsylvania holds the record for the nation's largest lottery
jackpot, $115 million in April 1989. The holders of 14 tickets
split the prize.
   The record for a lottery prize to a single winner is held by
Florida. Sheelah Ryan of Winter Springs won $55.1 million two years
ago.
   Ms. Ryan called the Lottery Department on Monday to wish the new
winners well, Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul said.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
of Britain today proposed that a 35-nation summit this fall adopt a
universal code of rights for Europe and North America.
   In a speech to Czechoslovakia's parliament - the country's first
democratically elected legislature in five decades - she also urged
that the 12-nation European Community offer full membership to
Czechoslovakia and Eastern Europe's other new democracies as soon
as they have introduced Western-style economies.
   ``If we can create a great area of democracy stretching from the
west coast of the United States right across to the Soviet Far
East, that would give us the best guarantee of all for security -
because democracies don't go to war with each other,'' the British
leader said.
   Mrs. Thatcher also apologized for the 1938 Munich Treaty, in
which Britain endorsed Adolf Hitler's division of Czechoslovakia.
   ``We failed you in 1938, when a disastrous policy of appeasement
allowed Hitler to extinguish your independence,'' she said.
  Although Britain's wartime leader Winston Churchill was quick to
repudiate the agreement, the British ``still remember it with
shame,'' she added.
   ``In contrast to 1938, the United States, Europe and, indeed,
the wider world have responded with an impressive display of unity
to Saddam Hussein's aggression,'' she said of Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Turning to Alexander Dubcek, whose 1968 Prague Spring attempts
to create ``socialism with a human face'' were crushed by Soviet
tanks, Mrs. Thatcher also referred ruefully to the West's lack of
action then.
   ``The pictures of that brave venture are etched in our memory,
and our inability to help remains a burden on the free world's
conscience,'' she said.
   Dubcek is now president of Parliament.
   Mrs. Thatcher, the first British prime minister to visit
Czechoslovakia, is on a trip celebrating the downfall of communism
in Central Europe. She will also visit Hungary.
   Her visit followed one last week by French President Francois
Mitterrand, whose country also signed the Munich agreement
endorsing Hitler's annexation of the Sudetenland in northern
Czechoslovakia.
   A year later Germany invaded Poland and World War II broke out.
   After her speech, Mrs. Thatcher walked to central Wenceslas
Square with Dubcek and President Vaclav Havel.
   The square is the heart of Prague's peaceful November revolution
and the British leader laid flowers at the statue of Bohemian
patron St. Wenceslas - the rallying point for most of the
revolution's protests.
   Crowds gathered despite the drizzle and applauded as Mrs.
Thatcher laid the flowers and then went over to shake hands with
several well-wishers.
   Before leaving Prague for Bratislava, she formally renamed a
nearby square Winston Churchill Square after Britain's World War II
leader. It was formerly named after Antonin Zapotocky, a post-war
Communist Party secretary.
   In Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, she planned to meet with
Slovak leaders before leaving for Budapest late today.
   Underlining her proposal for a 35-nation universal code of
rights, Mrs. Thatcher presented the assembly with a copy of
England's 13th century Magna Carta, which guaranteed basic freedoms
for the population.
   Mrs. Thatcher did not provide details of her proposal, but it
seemed to involve a document guaranteeing basic human rights.
   She said she wanted a ``European Magna Carta'' adopted at the
summit of the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe to be held in Paris in November. The conference includes all
European countries, except Albania, in addition to the United
States and Canada.
   Mrs. Thatcher has urged repeatedly that the group become a key
consultative body for the new Europe and its relations with North
America following the collapse of Communist rule in most of the
East Bloc last year and reforms in the Soviet Union.

   Nationalist protesters attacked KGB headquarters
in the capital of the republic of Georgia, smashing windows and
hurling documents into the street, Soviet news agencies and
newspapers reported today.
   The attack early Monday in the city of Tbilisi followed a
demonstration by members of the ``Round Table,'' who declared the
formation of a ``Free Georgia'' bloc of political parties for
elections next month, the Tass news agency reported.
   The demonstrators demanded the release of activist David
Gelashvili, who was arrested on charges of illegally storing
firearms and attacking a police station, according to Tass and the
independent Postfactum news agency. Gelashvili later was freed on
bail on Monday, Postfactum reported.
   According to the newspaper Red Star, marchers stormed the first
and second floors of the KGB headquarters. They ransacked offices
of the secret police's investigation department, broke windows,
threw documents in the street and stole some papers, the newspaper
said.
   Postfactum reported that some firearms were stolen.
   No arrests were reported. According to Red Star, the local
police decided not to interfere in the demonstration.
   The Sunday evening rally was addressed by Zviyad Gamsakhurdia,
who leads the ``Round Table,'' Red Star reported.
   The group's platform urges outlawing Soviet power in Georgia,
proclaiming the republic's independence, and preventing Communist
Party members from being elected to parliament, the newspaper said.
   Nationalists also want the KGB disbanded in Georgia, Postfactum
reported, and it quoted Gamsakhurdia as saying demonstrations
against the secret police will continue in the republic.
   On Oct. 28, Georgia will hold multiparty elections that were
postponed in June to give parties time to organize against the
ruling Communists.
   Pro-independence groups have done well in local elections this
year elsewhere in the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Soviet Prime Minister Threatens to Resist Radical Economic Plan</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts 1 graf after 4th, `Asked by...' with Ryzhkov comment
last week.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov indicated today
he will resign or refuse to cooperate if the national legislature
adopts radical economic reforms that he opposes.
   Ryzhkov's comments came during a break in the Supreme Soviet
legislature's second day of debate over three competing economic
reform plans, the most conservative of which Ryzhkov put forward
last week.
   As prime minister, Ryzhkov, 61, oversees the government
bureaucracy and could play a key role in putting any reform plan
into effect - or obstructing it.
   Asked by a reporter whether he would step down if the
legislature rejected his plan, Ryzhkov said: ``I will carry out
that in which I believe. That's all. I will not carry out any other
(plan).''
   Ryzhkov also said last week that if his plan was defeated, he
would ``take responsibility for it before the people and the
Supreme Soviet.'' But he has avoided making a clear promise to step
aside if radical reforms are enacted.
   Several leading reformers, including Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov,
have demanded Ryzhkov's resignation since he presented his plan,
which envisions continued central control of the economy while slow
moves are made toward a market-based system.
   By contrast, the radical reform plan adopted a week ago by the
parliament of Russia, the largest Soviet republic, calls for
switching to a market within just 500 days. It would retur land to
private farmers, sell government enterprises to private
stockholders and gradually remove state-controlled prices on many
goods.
   Thousands of people marched through Moscow on Sunday to demand
that Ryzhkov resign for failing to improve the Soviet economy,
plagued by shortages of consumer goods ranging from tobacco to
paper and shoes.
   But President Mikhail S. Gorbachev rejected those demands
Monday, telling parliament that reshuffling ``the top echelons of
power ... would draw us into grim political battles, (and) would
heighten confrontation in society at a time when we most badly need
consolidation to carry out the market economy program.''
   Instead, Gorbachev proposed a national referendum on ending
collectivized farming. He did not say when the referendum would be
held, who would vote or where he personally stood on the issue.
   Soviet peasants were coerced into joining collective farms and
all land became state property during a 1929-1932 campaign led by
Josef Stalin that is believed to have claimed the lives of between
5 million and 10 million people.
   Gorbachev has backed a compromise economic plan that contains
many elements of the radical 500-day plan but would move at a
slower pace and not disturb the central government's power to levy
taxes.
   The compromise proposal also backs away from private ownership
of land. While economist Stanislav Shatalin's 500-day plan calls
for selling some land to individuals for nominal prices, the
compromise calls for leasing it.
   Gorbachev apparently is reluctant, either personally or
politically, to part with six decades of Communist Party
ideological opposition to private ownership of land, said Professor
Murray Feshbach of Georgetown University in Washington.
   ``Gorbachev just can't bring himself to turn in his party
card,'' Feshbach said in a telephone interview.
   Gorbachev has urged a compromise to avoid a split with the
parliament of the Russian Federation, the largest of the 15 Soviet
republics with half the country's people and three-quarters of its
land. The Russian parliament overwhelmingly adopted Shatalin's
500-day plan last week.

   Gen. Merrill A. McPeak, tapped to succeed
fired Air Force Chief of Staff Michael J. Dugan, is a
much-decorated pilot who has flown combat missions in Vietnam and
performed in daring air shows at home.
   McPeak, 54, is commander in chief of the Pacific Air Forces at
Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii. His responsibility includes U.S.
air operations over half the globe - from Japan to the United
States. He commands over 60,000 people.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Monday he would recommend to
President Bush that McPeak replace Dugan, whom Cheney dismissed for
revealing to reporters U.S. contingency plans to bomb Baghdad and
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Cheney said Dugan, a four-star
general, displayed ``lack of judgment.''
   McPeak entered the Air Force in 1957, getting his pilot wings a
year later.
   In his 33 years of service, McPeak has flown over 4,000 hours on
fighter planes and also became a skilled parachutist.
   For two years starting in 1966, he flew solo or the lead
position in nearly 200 air shows as a member of the Thunderbirds -
the U.S. Air Force Air Demonstration Squadron.
   The stunt flying was good preparation for his next mission:
Vietnam.
   McPeak flew 269 combat sorties during the year he served there,
earning several decorations.
   He then turned to the academic world, completing the National
War College in 1974 and earning a master's degree at the same time.
   McPeak was assigned to command U.S. air bases in England and
Spain, and was promoted to chief of staff of U.S. air forces in
Europe.
   He subsequently held several command positions at home, assuming
his current job in July 1988. He was made a full general at the
same time.
   McPeak is married and has two sons.

<TEXT>
   As European nations showed strengthened resolve in the Persian
Gulf crisis, the United States today indicated the toll it has
taken at home, reporting that soaring energy prices last month
pushed the cost of living up by 0.8 percent.
   Members of nine European nations were meeting today in Paris to
discuss building up their forces in the gulf. The meeting came as
European countries joined President Bush in expressing support for
expanding U.N. sanctions against Iraq to air corridors.
   The governments were angered by Iraq's rough treatment of
Western diplomats in occupied Kuwait last week, when some had their
compounds raided.
   The latest picture of the situation inside Kuwait, drawn from
the tales of refugees suddenly allowed to flee via the lone border
crossing into Saudi Arabia, was of a wealthy nation broken and in
despair.
   Stunned refugees among the thousands who have fled their
homeland since the border was opened Saturday told of husbands and
sons pulled out of cars and hauled away by Iraqi troops.
   The Iraqis were not explaining what they intended to do with the
men.
   Because of the apparently random seizures of men ages 17 to 40,
the number of refugees crossing into Saudi Arabia had decreased to
a trickle today. Iraqi soldiers were allowing one car across the
border every 10 minutes or so.
   Refugees said today that the Iraqis had set up six checkpoints
on the 120-mile route from Kuwait City to the Khafji border
crossing.
   They said the Iraqis - seeking to break their spirit - had
mounted an escalating campaign of torture, beatings and shootings.
   One fleeing professional said the Iraqis were out ``to demolish
anything that has to do with Kuwait'' or its ruling al-Sabah
family, changing the names of streets, hospitals, traffic circles.
   The al-Sabahs, forced into exile by Saddam Hussein's Aug. 2
invasion, say the Iraqi leader intends to empty their oil-rich land
of its people.
   ``It is all becoming Iraqi,'' the professional said, estimating
that just 300,000 Kuwaiti nationals remain behind, with about half
a million having fled. Saddam has declared Kuwait part of Iraq and
annexed it, and the professional said a prominent traffic circle in
Kuwait City was being demolished to make way for a life-size statue
of Saddam.
   In Washington, meanwhile, the government said the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait Aug. 2 had sent gasoline prices up by 7.6 percent and
fuel prices jumped 15.4 percent - the steepest rise in those
categories since January.
   Economists said they believe more bad news is coming. They said
crude prices continued to rise in September and the increase would
be felt at the gas pump.
   Diplomatic activity continued today with the announcement that
Syrian President Hafez Assad would make his first trip to Iran, a
strong ally.
   Assad will fly to Tehran next week to discuss the Persian Gulf
crisis, the issue of hostages in Lebanon and Iran's poor relations
with Egypt and Saudi Arabia, now allied with Syria against Iraq,
officials in Iran and Syria said.
   The visit was expected to boost Assad's drive to project himself
as a dependable ally of the West and clean up his country's image.
   Also, PLO chief Yasser Arafat arrived in Amman, Jordan, for
talks with King Hussein. Arafat arrived from Baghdad, where he met
with Saddam to discuss ways to resolve the crisis.
   In Paris, defense and foreign ministers of nine nations were to
gather to discuss building up Western European forces in the gulf
following a dramatic rise in tensions between Europe and Iraq in
recent days.
   The French navy, meanwhile, announced that France, Britain,
Italy and the Netherlands have carved out patrol districts in the
gulf region distinct from U.S. and Australian flotillas - part of
France's quest to maintain military independence.
   Meeting in Brussels on Monday, foreign ministers of the
12-nation European Community agreed to expel all Iraqi military
attaches in retaliation for the Iraqi raids Friday on the French,
Belgian, Dutch and Canadian embassy compounds in Kuwait.
   They also restricted the movement of Iraq's diplomats and called
on the Iraq to ``realize the suicidal character of its behavior
toward the international community.''
   In addition, Britain ousted eight officials at the Iraqi Embassy
and deported 23 other Iraqi citizens. France has expelled 29 Iraqis
since Friday.
   A 17-member Japanese medical team flew to Saudi Arabia today,
the first Japanese personnel sent to assist the U.S.-led force
against Iraq.
   The five doctors, four nurses and eight support staff will visit
the capital, Riyadh, and other major Saudi cities for about two
months to study how a planned 100-member Japanese medical
contingent will be able to contribute to the gulf force, the
Foreign Ministry said.
   Japan, after being criticized for moving too slowly, has pledged
$4 billion to the U.S.-led multinational gulf forces.
   President Bush on Monday endorsed expanding the U.N.-ordered
embargo on trade with Iraq to include air traffic.
   ``What we want to do is tighten up the United Nations sanctions
so nothing is going in,'' he told reporters in Washington. ``Some
countries ... seem to be more willing than others to avoid the
sanctions.''
   The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council have
been meeting since the weekend, but Western diplomats say it will
be difficult to achieve unanimity on the air blockade issue.
   The United States, Britain and France support the blockade, but
China and the Soviet Union were said to oppose it. All five council
members appeared to back a resolution that would take punitive
measures against violators of the existing embargo.
   An air blockade is considered risky because halting planes is
difficult without the use of deadly force.
   Bush said Americans were ``magnificently united'' behind the
deployment of some 150,000 U.S. troops in the region to stand up to
Saddam and forestall a possible invasion of Saudi Arabia.
   But he acknowledged: ``I'm not clear in my own mind how long
this kind of support holds up.''
   In an indication of the sensitivity surrounding the U.S.
deployment, the head of the air force was fired Monday after
discussing contingency plans for air strikes against Baghdad.
   Air Force chief of staff Gen. Mike Dugan, made the remarks while
touring U.S. military installations in Saudi Arabia, and they were
published Sunday in The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times.
   ``There are certain things we never talk about,'' an angry
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told reporters in Washington.
   Also today in Jerusalem, an Israeli Cabinet minister said Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had called Saddam a ``wild beast''
during a meeting last week in Moscow with two Israeli officials.
   The talks were the highest-level encounter between the two
countries, which have had no formal relations since Moscow cut the
ties in 1967.

   A gasoline-laden tanker on the Saginaw
River burned early today after a series of explosions reignited
flames that firefighters doused hours earlier.
   The Coast Guard said it was too dangerous to try to put out the
fire aboard the listing hulk in the dark.
   This morning, officials again were considering whether to let
the fire burn itself out or apply foam to the blaze. And
authorities flew over the site by helicopter to check for signs of
environmental damage.
   The M.V. Jupiter, carrying 1 million gallons of gasoline, first
exploded and burned while unloading at a pier Sunday, leaving one
crew member missing and presumed dead. Three others remained
hospitalized today in fair condition.
   The fire burned nearly 30 hours before specialists from Texas
smothered it with foam Monday afternoon. But eight hours later, the
ship exploded again.
   ``Obviously, the vessel was still hot and there was still fuel
in the cargo bin,'' said Dan Lacy, a spokesman for Ashland Oil Inc.
of Ashland, Ky., parent of Cleveland Tankers Inc., which owns the
tanker.
   No new injuries were reported early today. Coast Guard Petty
Officer Patrick Higgins said firefighters hoped to quench the
flames again using foam.
   Authorities planned to inspect the crippled ship to gauge
damage, how much fuel remained and how to remove the fuel and the
tanker.
   State police Lt. Robert Nelson the Jupiter may have to be pumped
free of fuel, water and firefighting chemicals before it can be
moved.
   By the time the blaze was put out Monday, the rail of the ship
where the fire was most intense had sunk to within 6 inches of the
water's surface and some fuel splashed out and burned on the water,
said Terry Walkington, spokesman for the state Department of
Natural Resources.
   Barbara Singleton, a sheriff's emergency worker, was sitting in
a car with a co-worker on shore near the ship when it exploded
again.
   ``I went out one door and he went out the other,'' Singleton
said. ``About a minute after the blast ... there came that smell
again'' of burning gasoline.
   State specialists were awaiting results of air- and
water-pollution tests after hundreds of dead fish washed ashore
near the tanker but said there was little evidence of a big pill
downtream.
   ``We don't know if it was the explosion, or if it was from the
heat that caused stress on the fish,'' said Mike Moore, Department
fo Natural Resources deputy director.
   The cause of the explosion was unclear, but Ashland spokesman
Lacy said the wake of a passing ship could have parted some of the
Jupiter's mooring lines and its gasoline transfer connection,
spilling fuel that ignited the blast.

<HEAD>Police Plan DNA Tests on Former Minister Suspected in Wife's
Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blood and saliva taken from a former Dallas
minister suspected in the near strangulation of his wife will be
used for DNA profiling, a newspaper reported today.
   Federal and local authorities hope the scientific process will
help identify the attacker of Margaret Railey, who has been
comatose since the attack in April 1987, the Dallas Times Herald
reported.
   Walker Railey, formerly a prominent Methodist minister, has been
the only suspect. While maintaining his innocence, he has declined
to testify before a grand jury, and a judge found him responsible
in a civil proceeding.
   FBI agents in California on Friday took Railey to a detention
center, where he gave court-ordered blood and saliva samples.
   FBI and Dallas police wouldn't comment officially, but sources
within both agencies told the newspaper they were taking the body
fluids for DNA testing.
   DNA - deoxyribonucleic acid - is found in every cell and is
unique in each person. Its use as an identification tool is
considered the most important development in criminal
investigations since fingerprinting. Body tissue, such as hair,
skin or blood, is often found at crime scenes.
   The Railey attack happened before DNA testing was available, but
the technique can still be applied because ``there is a long shelf
life of the physical evidence,'' the newspaper quoted an
unidentified FBI agent as saying.
   Norman Kinne, the chief assistant Dallas district attorney, said
DNA profiling of Railey was the FBI's idea. He added that if the
testing links Railey to the crime scene, ``it certainly would be
significant to the case.''
   The FBI has been investigating the attack because of Railey's
claims he received threatening letters before his wife was
attacked. Police later concluded that they had been typed at
Railey's own church.
   Mrs. Railey was attacked in the garage of the couple's home
while Railey claimed to have been at a library. It was later
determined he also had been at the home of his mistress, a Dallas
psychologist with whom he later lived in California.
   At the time of the attack, Railey was pastor at the 6,000-member
First United Methodist Church of Dallas. Subsequently, he left the
ministry, gave guardianship of his two children over to friends,
and moved to California.
   Railey was held responsible for his wife's attack in a civil
trial and was ordered to pay $18 million. He has since filed for
divorce from Mrs. Railey, who remains in a vegetative state in a
nursing home.

   President Hafez Assad of Syria will make
his first trip to his ally Iran next week to discuss the Persian
Gulf crisis and Western hostages in Lebanon, diplomats said today.
   Official announcements in Tehran and Damascus said that Asasd
will fly to Iran ``next week'' at the invitation of Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   Tehran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, said, ``Observers attach special significance to President
Assad's visit in the wake of the crisis in the Persian Gulf.'' It
did not elaborate on the topics to be discussed nor mention the
length of the visit.
   Diplomats in Damascus, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
a number of sensitive issues were expected to be on the Assad's
agenda - the gulf crisis, the plight of Western hostages in
Lebanon, and Iran's poor relations with Egypt and Saudi Arabia,
with whom Damascus is allied in the confrontation with Iraq.
   The visit was expected to boost Assad's drive to project himself
as a dependable ally of the West and clean up his country's image
after years of isolation because of its implication in terrorism.
   The trip follows talks in Damascus last week between Assad and
Secretary of State James Baker III. That was the first major
face-to-face contact between Damascus and Washington since
President Bush was elected in 1988.
   On his trip, Baker won a pledge from Assad to commit more troops
and armor to a U.S.-led multinational force that assembled in Saudi
Arabia after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   About 4,000 Syrian troops already had been sent to the region,
and diplomats said Assad promised to send 15,000 more.
   Assad's stance on the gulf crisis, motivated largely by personal
hatred of Iraq's Saddam Hussein and loyalty toward his Kuwaiti
bankrollers, marks the first time that he has sided with the United
States in a Middle East conflict.
   Baker said while in Damascus that he was concerned about Iranian
calls for a jihad, or holy war, against foreign forces in the gulf.
   U.S. officials also have been alarmed by reports that Iran was
punching holes in the emabrgo imposed on Iraq by the U.N. Security
Council.
   Many foodstuffs tat had disappeared from the Iraqi market have
reappeared in recent days and residents have said the goods are
coming from Iran, Iraq's enemy in a 1980-88 war.
   Diplomats in Damascus said the talks with Iran may produce a
breakthrough on the hostages in Lebanon, although Baker said Assad
did not indicate a hostage release was imminent.
   Six of the 13 Western captives held in Lebanon are Americans.
The others are four Britons, two Western Germans and an Italian.
   American journalist Terry Anderson, 42, is the longest-held
hostage. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, was kidnapped on March 16, 1985.
   Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon with 40,000 of its
troops controlling two-thirds of the country.
   But it has avoided a showdown with the Shiite extremists, mainly
because Iran had been its only ally while the Western world rallied
against Damascus.
   The Syrian government was implicated in the April 1986 attempt
to blow up an Israeli jetliner at London's Heathrow Airport.
   The explosion of a Pan Am jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
which 290 people were killed in December 1988, was blamed on the
radical Popular front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command.
   The United States urged Damascus to close down PFLP-GC bases in
Syria and expel the group's leader, Ahmed Jibril, a former Syrian
army captain. But Syria refused on the grounds the evidence
implicating Jibril was not solid.
   Baker said before he left Damascus that the differences over
terrorism and Jibril's presence in Syria remained unresolved.

   Supporters of abortion rights asked the Senate
Judiciary Committee today to reject David Souter's nomination to
the Supreme Court. ``The health and lives of millions of American
women'' are at stake, they said.
   A leading conservative, meanwhile, said Souter should not be
confirmed because he hasn't done enough to stop abortion.
   In three days of testimony that ended Monday night, Souter
declined to disclose his views on abortion. The nominee said he had
not made up his mind on whether to overturn the 1973 court ruling
legalizing abortion.
   ``We consider placing Judge Souter on the Supreme Court to be
too great a risk,'' said Kate Michelman, executive director of the
National Abortion Rights Action League.
   ``The health and lives of million of American women, for
generations to come, may depend on where David Souter stands,''
said Faye Wattleton, president of Planned Parenthood of America.
   Their testimony was criticized by committee members, including
Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., himself a backer of abortion rights.
   ``You're making a big mistake,'' Simpson said. ``There are going
to be other Supreme Court cases, where you're really going to have
to be in the trenches,'' he said. Simpson added that, as a federal
judge, Souter could not answer the abortion question because of
judicial ethics.
   A strong anti-abortion conservative, Howard Phillips, said in
prepared testimony that Souter should be rejected as too
pro-abortion. Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus, cited
the fact that Souter served on the boards of two hospitals where
abortions were performed and had gone along with the practice.
   ``He lacked the moral courage or discernment to help prevent the
destruction of so many innocent human lives when he had the
authority - indeed the responsibility - to do so,'' Phillips said.
   Committee members said Souter appeared assured of confirmation
when his testimony ended Monday night.
   Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., told Souter his
appearance had been ``a tour de force on your part.''
   Biden said some senators, including himself, were still
undecided on the nomination. But he told Souter, who marked his
51st birthday Monday, that cause to celebrate could come ``in two
or three weeks'' - the presumed schedule for committee approval and
Senate confirmation.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who repeatedly probed Souter's
suitability with questions on rights issues, including abortion,
appeared to concede at the end that Souter would be confirmed.
   As the New Hampshire judge's appearance drew to a close Monday
night, Kennedy told Souter that he would tip the balance in
discrimination cases before the court.
   ``You're going to be, really, the swing (vote) on this issue as
well as many others,'' he said.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., asked Souter to ``err on the side of
freedom'' once on the court.
   Simpson, reflecting the apparent unanimous support of the six
Republicans on the 14-member panel, told Souter he had impressed
the nation during the televised testimony.
   ``Out in the land, there is a good feeling,'' said Simpson.
   ``A lot of people have the feeling that your confirmation
processis over,'' Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., told Souter.
   In his testimony, Souter worked without the help of notes and
displayed a vast knowledge of constitutional disputes. But he
avoided giving the committee even a clue of how he would vote on
the hottest issues before the court.
   All three days, Souter repeatedly pushed aside attempts by
senators on both sides of the issue to extract his views on
abortion. He maintained his mind was still open.
   On Monday, he expressed his appreciation for the gravity of the
case, saying that overturning the 1973 Roe vs. Wade abortion
decision would affect thousands of lives, could result in widely
different laws from state to state, and could throw into question
other rulings on privacy issues.
   On other topics Monday, he:
   -Said he believed the death penalty was constitutional and not
prohibited by the ban on ``cruel and unusual punishment.''
   -Stated that he wished he had insisted, while New Hampshire's
attorney general, that the state return money to a utility that
donated funds for prosecuting protesters at its Seabrook nuclear
plant.
   -Repeated his aversion to being portrayed personally as an
isolated scholar unaware of societal problems, and promised to
learn more about the nation as he had with his native state. ``We
cannot seal ourselves away,'' he said of the judiciary.
   After completing its hearings, the Judiciary Committee will meet
to vote on the Souter nomination and send its recommendation to the
full Senate.
   Sen. Herbert Kohl, D-Wis., the newest committee member going
through his first Supreme Court confirmation process, said he
thought Souter had gone far to ensure his success.
   But he expressed doubt the hearings had unveiled the nominee's
thoughts. While Souter's record suggested he was very conservative,
Kohl said, he appeared before the committee as a moderate.
   ``There's a certain mystery'' as to how he will appear on the
court, Kohl said. ``We can't open up a person's mind.''

   Atlanta brought the Olympics to the American South
today, winning a long race over Athens and four other rivals to be
host of the 1996 Summer Games.
   The victory in voting by the International Olympic Committee
means the 100th birthday of the modern Olympics will be staged in
one of the world's most modern cities and take the Games into their
second century on a high-tech, big-money road.
   The decision, read from a sealed ballot by International Olympic
Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch, ended the hopes of
Athens to stage the '96 Games in the country where the Olympics
were born in 776 B.C. and reincarnated in 1896.
   Atlanta had entered the final days of the four-year contest
generally rated among the front-runners. It received a boost in its
formal presentation with a videotaped appeal by President Bush.
   It caught Athens on the third of the maximum five ballots, took
the lead on the fourth and won it 51-35 as it picked up most of the
22 votes Toronto had on the previous round.
   Other runners-up, in order of their elimination, were Belgrade,
Yugoslavia; Manchester, England; and Melbourne, Australia.
   Atlanta is world headquarters of Coca-Cola, one of the Olympics'
biggest sponsors. It is the home of pro football, baseball and
basketball teams, prestigious universities large and small, and the
civil rights movement.
   It's ``Gone with the Wind'' and Stone Mountain, catfish and
Cable News Network's Ted Turner. And now, it's also an Olympic
city.
   In Atlanta today, fireworks and balloons filled the morning sky
when the International Olympic Committee gave the city the Games.
   Thousands of people, gathered at the Underground Atlanta
shopping and entertainment district for an Olympic party, shouted
with joy when they heard the announcement over huge televisions
broadcasting the committee meeting live from Tokyo.
   The boom of fireworks could be heard throughout the downtown
area. A band played the Olympic theme, and strangers hugged each
other.
   ``I am absolutely amazed. I can't believe Atlanta has gone from
a place nobody thought had a chance to really getting those
games,'' said Michael Lomax, chairman of the Fulton County
Commission.
   ``It made me feel I was making the Olympic team again,'' said
Evander Holyfield, the former Olympic boxer who is from Atlanta.
   Atlanta joined Los Angeles (1932 and 1984) and St. Louis (1904)
as U.S. Summer Olympic hosts. The '84 Games ushered in an era of
unimagined money for the International Olympic Committee, and
holding the Games in Atlanta increased the chances for big money
from American TV networks. The IOC announced last week the Olympic
movement would make $1.84 billion in the four years leading up to
1992, not bad for an organization that was almost broke a decade
ago.
   With solid facilities built or planned, impeccable hotels and
infrastructure and glowing reports from various evaluation
commissions, the International Olympic Committee decided to go for
the gold again.
   ``The IOC awards the 1996 Olympic Games to the city of
Atlanta,'' Samaranch said.
   The Atlanta delegation, led by chief organizer Billy Payne,
appeared overcome by joy. Payne had left the session room in tears
after presenting Atlanta's final report earlier in the day.
   The conference hall erupted in cheers.
   Greece was the birthplace of the Olympics, and staged their
rebirth a century ago. Athens had good facilities, and it certainly
had history on its side. ``We have sent the torch away 25 times in
100 years. We are only asking for it once,'' Greek Prime Minister
Constantine Mitsotakis told the members.
   But Spyros Metaxa, the leader of Athens' campaign, had upset
some Olympic Committee members by saying that ``morally, the Games
belong to us.'' The Greeks also were accused of arrogance and
flouting the rules of the bidding.
   Exiled King Constantine of Greece, an International Olympic
Committee member, said he was ``deeply disappointed along with all
Greeks that the centenary Games were not awarded to Athens.''
   ``But we must bow to the democratic process of the IOC and I
congratulate the winner on its successful election,'' Constantine
said.
   Beginning in 1994, the Summer and Winter Olympic Games will be
staggered, rather than held during the same year.
   For example in 1992, the Winter Games will be held Feb. 8-23 in
Albertville, France, and the Summer Games July 25-Aug. 9 in
Barcelona, Spain.
   In 1994, the Winter Games will be held in Lillehammer, Norway,
followed two years later by the Summer Games in Atlanta.
   The cities bidding for the 1998 Winter Games include Salt Lake
City; Aosta, Italy; Jaca, Spain; Nagano, Japan; Ostersund, Sweden,
and Sotchi, U.S.S.R.

<TEXT>
   Ireland's first contested presidential
election in 17 years will be held on Nov. 7, the government said
today.
   A civil rights activist from Northern Ireland, a women's rights
campaigner from Dublin and a popular defense minister are in the
race to succeed President Patrick Hillery, who is barred from
seeking a third seven-year term.
   Fianna Fail, the nation's largest political party, on Monday
nominated Defense Minister Brian Lenihan for the largely ceremonial
post.
   Fine Gael, the second-largest party, earlier selected Austin
Currie, a Roman Catholic civil rights leader. The Labor Party
nominated Mary Robinson, a lawyer and former member of the Irish
senate.
   Lenihan, 59, was foreign minister from 1987 to 1989, and he is
also the deputy prime minister.
   Currie, 50, was a leader in the Catholic civil rights campaign
in Northern Ireland in the 1960s and a founder of the Social
Democratic and Labor Party, the largest predominantly Catholic
political party in the province. He and his family moved to Ireland
last year.
   He says that Northern Ireland will be an issue in his campaign,
because ``it is one of the greatest problems facing this nation as
a whole.''
   Mrs. Robinson, 46, has been a champion of women's rights and of
liberal social legislation such as the ill-fated attempt to
legalize divorce in 1986.
   Last year, she successfully defended students at Trinity College
against an anti-abortion group's attempt to prevent them from
distributing information about abortion services in Britain.
   The incumbent, Hillery, was chosen under an all-party agreement
in 1976, and was installed as president without an election. In
1983, parties also agreed on Hillery, and no polling was held for
the post.

   Jimmy Carter is outpolling Ronald Reagan.
   A Times Mirror survey released Tuesday found that Carter gets
higher favorability ratings than Reagan.
   Sixty-seven percent of the people questioned said they had a
very favorable or mostly favorable opinion of Carter, while 62
percent had comparable views of Reagan, the man who defeated Carter
in 1980.
   Despite recent favorable attention connected to the opening of
his presidential library, Richard M. Nixon continues to be held in
low esteem. Thirty-eight percent had favorable opinions of Nixon,
while 58 percent viewed him unfavorably.
   The results were based on interviews with 3,004 adults and had a
margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.

   Three security personnel were injured by the rocks during the
clash Monday in Mandalay, the country's second-largest city, the
radio said. It said several demonstrators were detained.
   A transcript of Monday's broadcast was seen in Bangkok on
Tuesday. Accounts from Western diplomats in Rangoon suggest that
the radio generally downplays the seriousness of demonstrations and
the extent of injuries to demonstrators.
   The clash occurred on the eve of the anniversary of the brutal
military takeover of Sept. 18, 1988. In it, Army Chief Gen. Saw
Maung overthrew civilian President Maung Maung and his soldiers
killed hundreds of unarmed pro-democracy demonstrators.
   In May, Saw Maung allowed the country's first free elections in
three decades but he has not allowed the victorious National League
For Democracy to form a new government. Instead, he has imprisoned
the party's leaders as well as students and other supporters.
   Mandalay was a center of the 1988 uprising.
   The state radio said Monday's clash began when five students who
had been expelled from the highs achool climbed over its back wall,
wielding a sword, a dagger and slingshots.
   They joined students who were waiting for them and unfurled a
flag, chanted slogans, made threats, and called on students in the
classrooms to join in, the broadcast said.
   It said they then threatened the principal and a teacher with
their weapons. In a field in front of the school, they burned
examination papers they had seized from students.
   The broadcast said security personnel appealed to the crowd of
about 50 onlookers to disperse before moving in. But it said
students and others were ``bent on creating disturbances.''

   The restoration of diplomatic ties
between the Soviet Union and Saudi Arabia further isolates Iraq and
allows the kingdom to counter Iraqi charges that it is too
dependent on the United States.
   Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait helped speed the Soviet-Saudi
agreement to exchange ambassadors for the first time in 52 years.
The agreement was announced Monday in Moscow.
   ``This is a move that has been in the works for a long time and
is the natural culmination of a series of events,'' said a Western
diplomatic source. ``There was no question that it would come
within a year, but the events of Aug. 2 accelerated it.''
   The agreement also paves the way for arms deals between the
Soviet Union and Saudi Arabia, which has long been allied with the
United States.
   Prince Abdul-Rahman bin Abdul-Aziz, the deputy defense minister,
made off-the-cuff comments to reporters Tuesday referring to the
general Saudi military procurement policy of seeking ``developed
weapons whatever the type.''
   ``The Soviet Union is a superpower and events have proved it is
an important element of the United Nations and its resolutions,''
Prince Abdul-Rahman said.
   The Soviets have endorsed seven Security Council resolutions
against Iraq since the invasion of Kuwait. Moscow also has cut off
arms shipments to its longtime ally.
   In Moscow on Tuesday, the Saudi foreign minister noted that,
like the Soviet Union, Saudi Arabia had been a previous ally of
Baghdad.
   ``Saudi Arabia stood with Iraq through many crises and we
supported Iraq in every possible way,'' Prince Saud Al-Faisal said
at a news conference.
   ``When these two countries stand together for the withdrawal of
Iraqi troops from Kuwait and for territorial legitimacy and
identify their position in a common way, this, I believe, should
give a message to the leadership of Iraq that their position is
untenable,'' Saud said.
   Pro-government Saudi papers welcomed the diplomatic relations.
The daily Okaz underscored the importance of the ties with a
country ``of such important political weight ... which has has
lately been clearly evident through the balanced policy that won
wide international support.''
   The Saudi newspapers noted that Soviet transformations on
religious freedom and human rights were conducive to a policy
``much in harmony with the kingdom's policy,'' Okaz said.
   Riyadh-based diplomats said that while the Persian Gulf crisis
has accelerated the re-establishment of formal relations, they were
not surprised at the development.
   ``It was the most logical move,'' said one diplomat, who like
the others spoke on condition of anonymity.
   When Saudi Arabia forged diplomatic ties with China in July,
experts predicted that relations with the Soviet Union would follow
within a year.
   During the Persian Gulf war, one source said, the Saudis
realized the advantage of having diplomatic relations with all
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. With the formal
exchange of envoys with the Soviet Union, the Saudis will have
achieved that goal.
   The communique issued Monday stated that both countries would
``work actively to achieve settlements to regional conflicts,
develop international cooperation, and strengthen overall peace and
security.''
   Sources here say the Soviet Union is not likely to contribute
either militarily or monetarily to solve the gulf crisis.
   ``The Soviet Union is so absorbed in its own problems, they
shouldn't be expected to contribute forces,'' one diplomat said.
``But what they're doing in the U.N. has been quite helpful. It's
an extra show of solidarity.''
   The Soviet Union, the first country to officially recognize King
Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia, called back its last ambassador to the
kingdom in 1938. He was later executed.

<HEAD>20 Years After His Death, Hendrix Fans Keep Guitar Great's Memory
Alive</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Twenty years after his death, legendary
rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix still packs 'em in.
   They don't come in large numbers at any one time, but they come.
Some bring guitars, some bring flowers. Visitors might spend a
little time at his grave, strumming tunes.
   ``The crowds here have mellowed a bit, as has the mood of the
country,'' said Hank Kerns, general manager of Greenwood Memorial
Park, where Hendrix is buried.
   ``Once in a while they'll leave a beer can, but we're careful to
get it picked up right away.''
   Kerns said the number of visitors to Hendrix's grave has
increased during the past few years, and the Goodwill Games brought
more than usual. One national magazine, he said, listed visiting
the gravesite as one of the things to do in Seattle while attending
the international athletic contest.
   Hendrix died in London on Sept. 18, 1970. According to coroner's
records, he died when he choked on his vomit. A non-lethal amount
of barbituate drugs was found in his system.
   ``Forever in our hearts,'' reads his headstone, which includes
an electric guitar carved in bas-relief. There is little to
indicate he was the king of acid rock, but by the time of his death
at age 27 he had forged a lasting legacy.
   ``I heard he was buried around here. I needed to make the
pilgrimage,'' Peg Wood said Sunday during a visit to the cemetery.
   The 26-year-old recently moved to Seattle from Illinois to begin
an internship with the Veterans Administration as she pursues a
Ph.D. in psychology. Her ``other life'' is playing rock guitar.
   ``My parents named me Peggy Sue, for God's sake. I was destined
for a life of decadent rock 'n' roll,'' she said, laughing.
   Hendrix, who grew up in Seattle's predominantly black Central
Area, was about 14 when he talked his father into buying him a $5
used guitar, according to Al Hendrix.
   ``He wore that thing out,'' the father said. ``Later on I got
him his first electric guitar and I got a sax. I didn't know much
about the sax and he didn't know much about the guitar. So we'd
make quite a bit of noise.''
   At first, the young Hendrix was content to play along with
recordings of blues greats B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
   ``So I told him, `Come up with something original,' and he
did,'' recalled Al Hendrix. ``The first time I heard `Are You
Experienced?' (the first Jimi Hendrix Experience album), it was
something altogether different than what I was used to listening
to.''
   It didn't take long for the elder Hendrix to become one of his
son's biggest fans. Innovative, sometimes outrageous and blaring
with his music, Jimi was quiet and unassuming offstage, his father
said.
   Al Hendrix still goes to his son's grave about once a month,
still gets a kick out of recalling the times he has found fans
sitting around the grave with guitars in hand.
   Fans frequently leave small items. Peg Wood added a guitar pick
to the collection there.
   ``He was the most inventive guitar player I ever heard,'' she
said. ``I like the blues. But I felt he rewrote them. He changed
the rules so that there weren't any rules. He freed me up.''

<TEXT>
   She was once known as ``Mother
of the Nation,'' a symbol of black defiance of South Africa's
racial policies. Now Winnie Mandela faces criminal charges and an
uncertain future in South Africa's anti-apartheid movement.
   The wife of African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela has
endured repeated hardships inflicted by the white-led government
throughout their 32 years of marriage.
   But in recent years, her controversial statements and sometimes
erratic behavior have put her at odds with anti-apartheid activists
and blacks in her own community.
   The government said Tuesday that Mrs. Mandela, 56, will be
charged with the 1988 kidnapping and assault of four young men,
including 14-year-old Stompei Seipei, who was killed.
   The head of her bodyguard unit, Jerry Richardson, was convicted
this year of murder and sentenced to death in the case.
   Mrs. Mandela has denied wrongdoing. She and her husband have
accused the government of using its investigation as a propaganda
campaign and said she would welcome a chance to defend herself.
   She will stand trial with seven members of the now-disbanded
Mandela United Football Club, which played few matches but served
as her entourage and bodyguard.
   Tuesday's announcement came as Mrs. Mandela appeared to have
reclaimed a leading role in the anti-apartheid movement. After her
husband's release in February from 27 years in prison, Mrs. Mandela
was highly visible though silent as she accompanied him on
international trips and to local rallies.
   She recently began to make strong anti-government statements
that sometimes contradicted official ANC policy.
   The ANC last month named her social welfare director, a move
criticized by some black leaders. It is the first official post she
has held in any anti-apartheid group.
   Some anti-apartheid figures have privately criticized Mrs.
Mandela for preferring the spotlight of international publicity to
the less glamorous task of political organization.
   ``She is blunt, rash, emotional and speaks from the heart - that
is why people respond to her and why she is controversial,'' said
Fatima Meer, author of a biography of Mandela.
   Following her husband's imprisonment in 1962, Mrs. Mandela
raised their two daughters alone while under constant restrictions,
including house arrest. She was held in solitary confinement for
more than a year, though never charged with a crime.
   She defied the government restrictions during nationwide unrest
in the mid-1980s, making fiery speeches at public rallies and
funerals of activists.
   Anti-apartheid leaders launched a campaign to promote her as
``Mother of the Nation.'' But a series of controversial statements
and actions eroded her stature.
   She told a 1986 rally, ``With our boxes of matches and our
necklaces, we shall liberate this country.'' The remark was a
reference to ``necklacing'' - the killing of suspected government
collaborators by setting ablaze a tire placed around the neck.
   The exiled ANC leadership disassociated itself from the remark
endorsing the practice.
   Many of Mrs. Mandela's recent troubles have stemmed from her
association with the soccer team. The Mandela home was burned down
in July 1988 by a group of black youths that clashed with Mandela
United.
   Then came accusations that Seipei and three others were abducted
by soccer team members and brought to Mrs. Mandela's new home,
where she allegedly beat them with a whip.

   A U.S. negotiator said Tuesday
Washington is prepared to give up its bases in the Philippines but
wants a final decision delayed until the next century and voted on
by the Filipino people.
   Chief U.S. negotiator Richard Armitage made the statement during
the opening session of talks here on the future of the U.S.-run
military facilities.
   ``It is clear to me ... that the days of a very large presence
of U.S. sailors and airmen in the Philippines are coming to an
end,'' Armitage said. ``What remains for us to determine is the
rate at which this presence will be reduced and the nature of the
relationship our two governments wish to pursue during and after
this transitional period.''
   ``Let the voters of the 21st century decide whether or not they
believe a continued U.S. presence will be helpful,'' Armitage said.
   A spokesman for the Philippine negotiators, Rafael Alunan,
welcomed Armitage's ``willingness ... to discuss the crafting of a
new relationship between our two countries'' but took exception to
Armitage's call for Filipino voters in the next century to decide
on the American presence.
   ``This matter is not to be decided in the 21st century,'' Alunan
said. ``The time for decision is now.''
   The lease on the U.S. bases expires in September 1991. Any
extension of the American presence after that must be approved by
the 23-member Senate, where opposition to the bases is strong, and
also by a national referendum if ordered by the Philippines
Congress.
   Analysts say most Filipinos would vote for the U.S. bases to
remain because of their economic benefits.
   The current talks are a continuation of negotiations that began
in May on the future of Clark Air Base, Subic Bay Naval Base and
four smaller U.S. facilities.
   U.S. officials previously stated U.S. troops would remain in the
Philippines only as long as they are wanted. But on Monday, State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Washington wants to keep
its bases in the Philippines.
   Armitage's statement marked the first time a U.S. official had
publicly raised the possibility of Washington's readiness to give
up the bases. He did not propose a timetable for removing the
40,000 troops, Defense Department civilians and military
dependents. U.S. sources said Washington hopes for continued access
to the facilities, perhaps on a commercial basis, after
relinquishing formal control.
   The United States has strongly supported President Corazon
Aquino's administration since 1986 when a civilian-military
uprising ended the 20-year rule of the late President Ferdinand
Marcos.
   In December, U.S. jets flew air cover for government forces
during an unsuccessful bid by military rebels to oust Mrs. Aquino.
American troops from the bases also provided help for the
government during a July earthquake that killed nearly 1,700
people.
   But opponents believe the bases infringe on national sovereignty
and represent a vestige of American colonial rule, which ended with
independence in 1946. U.S. forces have been in the Philippines
since the Americans captured the islands from Spain in 1898, except
for a period of Japanese occupation during World War II.
   Mrs. Aquino said Monday her government wants to maintain close
ties with Washington but that the end of the Cold War and absence
of any external threat to the Philippines made the bases less
important.
   Mrs. Aquino said a government committee was drafting plans to
convert the bases into civilian use, including a commercial airport
at Clark and a ship repair facility at Subic.
   Meanwhile, Communist rebels claimed responsibility for a bombing
late Monday at a Voice of America station 60 miles north of Manila.
The insurgents said the bombing was to protest continued U.S.
``domination'' of this former colony. There were no injuries, and
U.S. officials said damage was slight.
   Last May, Communist rebels killed two American airmen near Clark
on the eve of talks on the bases. American troops and their
families have been restricted to base to prevent possible attacks
during the current negotiations.

   If the Persian Gulf crisis culminates with the
removal of Saddam Hussein from power, experts on that part of the
world say they wouldn't look for democracy to blossom under the
Iraqi sun. Saddam's most likely successor would be a Saddam clone.
   The nature of any new government in Iraq, no matter what the
denouement of the current crisis, is one of the puzzlements for
those trying to visualize how the crisis might end.
   Saddam could lose his showdown with George Bush and hang on. But
it is just as likely that he could not survive such a humiliating
defeat. In that event, the experts suspect his successor would be
someone from his inner military circles, someone much like him.
   In Eastern Europe in the winter of 1989 and the spring of 1990,
the world saw one autocracy after another fall, to be replaced by
governments responsive to the popular will.
   But democracy is alien to Iraq and most of the rest of the Arab
world. Egypt is the only Arab country with a semblance of it.
   So the best betting is that whatever follows Saddam is likely to
be ``a government similar to the one that exists now'' - an
autocratic, one-man rule - says Herman Eilts, former U.S.
ambassador to Egypt and Saudi Arabia, now a Boston University
professor.
   ``Its presumably someone in the military,'' agrees Daniel Pipes,
director of the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia.
But, he says, the successor would probably only be a new face
behind the same old iron fist.
   The next government, like the present one, Pipes says, is likely
to be based on power, not principles. ``Saddam Hussein doesn't
stand for anything,'' he says, and neither would his successor.
   By contrast, Iran, Iraq's neighbor, is a government based on
ideology, the Muslim principles of the ayatollahs.
   The ``traditional'' way for governments to change in Iraq,
former CIA Director William Colby has noted, is when ``the
successor murders his predecessor.''
   But Saddam has already survived dozens of plots against him and
wiped out any visible opposition.
   The experts are uncertain whether Saddam can meet President
Bush's demand for Iraq to withdraw ``completely, immediately and
without condition'' from Kuwait and still survive.
   To find an ally for his conquest of Kuwait, Saddam gave back to
Iran virtually everything gained in the bloody eight-year Iran-Iraq
war. Buckling now to Bush's demands would make Iraqis look upon
both the war and the invasion as worthless enterprises for which
much was paid.
   ``The regime sustains power by doling out goodies and if he
withdraws from Kuwait, it's another blunder; he won't have any
goodies,'' says Laurie Mylroie, a fellow at the Harvard Center for
Middle Eastern Studies. In that event, she posits, the military may
move against him.
   ``If he were made to retreat with nothing to show for it, it
would be a serious humiliation and weaken his position,'' says
historian Shaul Bakhash of George Mason University in Virginia,
author of ``Reign of the Ayatollahs: Iran and the Islamic
Revolution.''
   But Eilts says that as long as Saddam keeps control of ``the
instruments of coercion'' - the army and the police - ``he can
still control the situation.''
   He notes reports that Saddam recently had 14 Army officers
executed to remind their survivors in the officer corps of the
price of dissent. There has been a spate of rumors of executions of
generals for opposing the takeover of Kuwait.
   If war comes, Pipes says, and the United States and its allies
defeat Iraq, Saddam of course would be removed by the victors, who
would then have the duty of replacing him.
   In a society with no democratic tradition, installing a new
government, one that will no longer be a threat to the region, will
become a responsibility of America and its allies.
   ``It is,'' he says, ``a staggering thought.''

<HEAD>Feds Cut Off Aid to DeKalb County, Ga., Schools</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Department of Education has cut up
to $7 million in aid to DeKalb County schools after a six-year
battle over whether or not the school system discriminates against
handicapped students.
   The school system contends the Department of Education's Office
for Civil Rights is overstepping its authority in investigating
allegations of discrimination.
   Among other things, the fund cut announced Monday would affect
special mathematics instruction for low-income pupils, assistance
for the handicapped and programs for immigrant children.
   School Superintendent Robert Freeman and the system's attorneys
went to U.S. District Court in Washington today, seeking a
temporary restraining order on removal of the funds until a lawsuit
being heard in that court is resolved. If that court rules against
DeKalb, May said, the system would appeal to the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court, said School spokeswoman Christine May.
   Freeman earlier acknowledged that the school system cannot
sustain the programs for long without federal aid, and said the
schools will back down if they lose in court.
   ``We can't afford to fight the U.S. government. We can't afford
to surrender any of our federal funds,'' said Freeman.
   ``Taking funds away from a school district is the most drastic
means for this office to enforce the law,'' said Michael L.
Williams, assistant U.S. secretary of education for civil rights.
``But when it is necessary to guarantee the protection of civil
rights for all, this administration will not hesitate to do so.''
   The county school system, just east of Atlanta, has about 71,000
students. As of May, 3,200 of those are either in
``self-contained'' centers, or taking four or more courses in
special education.
   Parents complained in 1984 the county refused to pay for
private, residential placements for handicapped children.
   May declined to comment on the parents' complaint.
   The parents could have filed complaints under the Education of
the Handicapped Act, which requires a ``free, appropriate public
education'' for disabled students.
   But they filed complaints instead under Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1983, a civil rights law barring
discrimination against the disabled in federally funded programs.
   The county refused to cooperate with the Education Department's
investigation of the complaints, saying the department had no
jurisdiction. The state of Georgia also refused to cooperate.
   While the Education of the Handicapped Act covers a set list of
disabilities, Section 504, school officials contend, could be used
to cover a wide range of problems, including illegal drug use.
   In a 1987 ruling on a procedural issue in the DeKalb case, a
federal judge in Atlanta said the dispute over authority under the
two laws had not been resolved by the courts.

<HEAD>Congressional Report Accidents Increase After Pilots Reach 60</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pilots over age 60 have twice as many
accidents as those in their 50s, but they're still safer than
pilots in their 20s or 30s, according to a congressional report.
   The Office of Technology Assessment reached no conclusion on
whether the Federal Aviation Administration should revise its
regulation forcing retirement at age 60 for pilots on major
airlines - those which operate planes with more than 30 seats.
There is no such requirement for corporate, private or
commuter-airline pilots.
   Critics have argued the age-60 rule for airlines arbitrarily
grounds many healthy, experienced pilots and denies the traveling
public the benefit of their skill.
   They have called for more flexible rules tied to stringent
medical examinations, but the OTA questioned whether current
testing techniques could adequately detect the subtle mental
deterioration which it deems the principal hazard posed by aging
pilots.
   The OTA's study, based on average accidents per 100,000 flight
hours for all pilots with more than 1,000 hours of flight
experience, found that ``pilots between ages 60 to 69 have an
accident rate that is 2.1 times higher than the accident rate for
50- to 59-year-olds.
   ``However, the same data show that the accident rate for the
60-to 69-year-old pilots is less than that for pilots in the
30-39-year-old and 20-29-year-old age groups,'' the report said.
   It found that experience clearly counts, noting that pilots over
60 with more than 5,000 flight hours have a lower accident rate
than pilots of any age with 1,000 to 5,000 flight hours. But in all
experience groups, the accident rate goes up after 60, the OTA
said.
   The congressional agency said the safety issue for major
airlines has little to do with the vulnerability of aging pilots to
sudden impairment - a heart attack, say - since a copilot and
sometimes a third flight officer are on the flight deck and could
take the controls in such cases.
   Rather, pilot-error accidents are almost always based ``on
mental error rather than the pilot's incapacitation'' and the data
showing higher accident rates for the over-60 bracket ``suggest
that the increase ... may be due to subtle age-related
deterioration in cognitive function.''
   Thus, more stringent or frequent medical exams likely would have
little effect on accident rates unless they involved more accurate
neuropsychological measurements than currently available, the OTA
said.
   The airline industry and the Air Line Pilots Association both
support the age-60 mandatory retirement rule.

   Musicians of the Philadelphia Orchestra
today ratified a contract in a last-ditch vote scheduled just hours
before the opening concert of the orchestra's 91st season.
   The orchestra had voted Mondaynight to reject the contract and
go on strike.
   Orchestra spokeswoman Bonnie Arnold announced the union members'
change of hear as musicians filed onto the stage of the Academy of
Music for rehearsal. She said tonight's performance would go on as
scheduled.
   She did not provide terms of the contract or the vote margin.
   The musicians' three-year contract expired at midnight Sunday.
At issue were pensions, seniority, medical benefits and radio
broadcasts.
   The last strike against the orchestra was in 1966 and lasted
eight weeks.
   Last week, Wolfgang Sawallisch, 67, was selected as the sixth
music director of the orchestra since it was founded in 1900.
Sawallisch will succeed Riccardo Muti starting with the 1993-94
season.
   Muti announced in the spring he would not renew his contract,
which expires in August 1992.

   Former President Reagan tutored Moscow university
students Tuesday on the finer points of capitalism and democracy
and said he'd copy Mikhail Gorbachev's economic reforms if he were
Soviet leader.
   Reagan also said during a question-and-answer session at Moscow
State University that he believes ``Germany has rejoined the
civilized world'' and will not repeat Nazi atrocities.
   Reagan met with about 45 students for an hour in the
university's mammoth administration building in the Lenin Hills
looking down on central Moscow. Later Tuesday, he met with the
board of directors of The Associated Press.
   ``He's great! He impresses me. He radiates energy!'' Yuri
Ammosov, a 21-year-old history student, said after listening to
Reagan.
   ``He does not seem as old as he is,'' said another student,
Edwin Lobinsh. ``I would think that he was about 60. He just keeps
on going.''
   Despite his hearing aid, the 79-year-old former president had
trouble hearing some of the students' questions and had to be
helped by U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock.
   But he had no trouble lauding Gorbachev, one of the school's
best-known graduates, and said the two men continue to build on the
relationship forged in front of a fireplace at their first summit
in Geneva in November 1985.
   ``Who would have thought that the warmth of that fireplace in
Geneva would melt the ice of the Cold War,'' Reagan said later in a
luncheon toast at the U.S. Embassy.
   Reagan told the students that if he suddenly became president of
the Soviet Union and had to salvage its crumbling economy, he would
follow the same course as Gorbachev ``to bring about private
ownership, to bring about the free economy that has proven so
fruitful for our own country.''
   Gorbachev's economic reform proposals were among the topics the
two discussed in the Kremlin on Monday, including the possibility
of a Soviet referendum on the decollectivization of farms.
   A key to the reform, he said, is a person's right to own land.
``Until you've done so, you can't realize the patriotism and the
pride that you have when you can stand on a piece of land and say,
`This is mine,''' Reagan told the group.
   Reagan said that while he wholeheartedly supported German
unification, he understood the apprehensions of many Soviets who
lost millions of people to the Nazis in World War II.
   He said the preservation of concentration camps as memorials
sends a message to young Germans that ``this must never happen
again.''
   ``So I think that Germany has rejoined the civilized world and
there will not be a repeat of the Nazi horror,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan urged more exchanges between Soviet and American
students, saying: ``If young people like you, in the world, could
get to know each other, there would never be another war.''
   Asked how he maintained his mental health during eight years in
the White House, Reagan quoted another former president, Abraham
Lincoln:
   ``He said at one point that he could not perform the duties of
his office for 15 minutes if he did not know that he could call
upon one who was wiser and stronger than all others,'' Reagan said.
   ``He was speaking, of course, of God. I learned while I was in
the White House why he said that.''
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, leave Moscow for Rome on Wednesday
after a five-day visit at Gorbachev's invitation. The two couples
dined together Monday night, but Raisa Gorbachev missed Tuesday's
lunch because of illness, her husband said.

<HEAD>GAO Says Poor Management at USDA Could Add $55 Million to Computer
Costs</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Subs graf 5, Thomas Burke, with Agriculture Department
comment.</NOTE>

   The government could be stuck with a $61.9
million bill for computer systems originally priced at $7 million
because of poor management in the Agriculture Department, says a
congressional report.
   The General Accounting Office said the government is paying
Andersen Consulting, a division of the Arthur Andersen accounting
firm, for the systems to monitor billions of dollars worth of
commodities inventories.
   ``One system was installed two years later than planned, and the
other is scheduled to be installed in July 1991, which would be
almost a six-year delay,'' said the GAO report. The report was
being reviewed today by a congressional subcommittee.
   The GAO, Congress' investigative arm, put heavy blame on
``ineffective project management and oversight'' by the Agriculture
Stabilization and Conservation Service, which commissioned the
work.
   Sarita Schotta, deputy administrator of the service, told the
House Government Operations subcommittee on agriculture she is now
providing the supervision the project should have had all along.
Schotta has been overseeing the project for a year. The costs have
been piling up since 1983.
   ``The delays and cost increase since the awarding of this
contract have been astonishing,'' said Rep. Robert Wise, D-W.Va.,
subcommittee chairman.
   He said the Agriculture Department's inspector general issued
reports in 1986 and 1987 criticizing the agency and Andersen
Consulting, but the ASCS never showed them to Andersen.
   The service deals with billions of dollars, administering farm
commodity, conservation and emergency assistance programs,
including commodity loans and price support payments to farmers.
   In 1989, for example, its program and administrative costs
amounted to $13 billion. By the end of the fiscal year, its
commodities inventories totaled nearly $4 billion.
   Since the 1950s, the service has used an automated system to
track the acquisition, storage, movement, sale and donation of
grain and processed commodities, but the computer system was
becoming outdated.
   In 1983, the service awarded Andersen a contract to update its
systems for $7 million. It tacked on a ``cost plus incentive fee''
because no one would take the job at fixed cost.
   ``Most agencies by now have learned that cost plus is a ticket
for automatic disaster,'' said Wise. He noted that the provision
has cost the taxpayers nine times the amount originally estimated
for work that is not yet complete.
   He said users of one of the systems are moving data into
personal computers to do sensitive reports.
   ``It seems the users do not feel that the system is reliable
enough to do critical work,'' Wise said.
   Wise said he found the nearly $62 million in spending
particularly troubling since the agency plans a massive upgrade of
other systems.
   In May, the agency said it needed an additional $57 million in
procurement authority for minicomputer equipment upgrades,
maintenance and software between July 1990 and September 1992.
   The GAO questioned the $57 million figure, saying it made its
own calculations and found the job could be done for about $25
million.

   The government Tuesday banned food
exports in an effort to improve domestic supplies in time for
winter.
   Sugar, cheese, cooking oil and detergent have been rationed
since late summer in most parts of Bulgaria as the government tries
to alleviate shortages. Other foodstuffs and vital consumer goods
such as soap and toilet paper are in short supply or unavailable.
   According to a government decree carried by the state BTA news
agency, the export ban was imposed ``to ensure the supply (of) the
necessary products for the population during the fall and winter
period.''
   ``Absolutely prohibited is the export of meat and meat products
and milk and milk products until the end of March next year,'' the
decree said. ``In addition, until the next harvest season, the
export is prohibited of feed grain, cereals, sunflower, vegetable
oil, soya, potatoes, onions and garlic.''
   Petko Simeonov, managing director of the opposition newspaper
Demokratsiya, told a rally Monday that ``we are in for hunger and
darkness'' in coming months.
   Energy also is in short supply due in part to the Persian Gulf
crisis, which cut into deliveries of Iraqi crude oil. Authorities
have begun cutting off electricity several times a day. In downtown
Sofia, the capital, power supplies were halted for one hour at 10
a.m., 2 p.m., and 6 p.m. Tuesday.
   The newspaper Duma of the governing Socialist Party warned
recently of the possibility of famine.

<HEAD>Civic Leaders Will Gather to Discuss Strategies to Fight Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Associated Press Writer&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush's drug advisory council Tuesday
announced a fall conference of civic leaders to discuss strategies
for winning the fight against illegal drugs in America's cities.
   The leadership forum, scheduled to be held Nov. 9-10, will be
the basis for organizing a national coalition of the 200 local
anti-drug organizations that have sprung up nationwide, the council
said.
   It is ``based on an emerging belief that a priceless resource in
our nation's war on drugs is a long list of local communities whose
private-sector leadership is both organized and committed to
initiate new activities, and to strengthen ongoing programs to
reduce the use of illegal drugs in that community,'' said Alvah H.
Chapman Jr., an advisory council member and former chairman of
Knight Ridder, Inc., the Miami-based newspaper company.
   Coalitions of local business, civic and religious leaders have
offered advice to schools and private firms about improving drug
education programs, Chapman said.
   Others have launched anti-drug advertising campaigns. A group in
Santa Barbara, Calif., has spurred anti-drug peer pressure among
the city's youth, he said. Still others are fostering programs to
promote drug-free workplace programs in private businesses.
   In Miami, the coalition that Chapman helped found pushed local
officials to eliminate bureaucratic obstacles to efforts to enforce
a law that allows demolition of crack houses in that city. Last
year, 475 crack houses were demolished, he said.
   ``The coalition didn't run the bulldozers that knocked down the
houses, but the coalition did use a bulldozer on the bureaucracy
that was preventing the local law that was in effect from for two
years from being really applied,'' Chapman said.
   Bush appointed the 27-member advisory council to help coordinate
private-sector and non-profit drug programs and to help enlist
volunteer organizations in the war on drugs, said the panel's
chairman, William Moss.
   Chapman said he hoped that the effort will unleash private money
to help expand drug-treatment programs, which he said must provide
24-hour service to those who want help.
   ``If you are making a decision to kick the drug habit and you
find the right phone number to call and you decide to call at 5:05
on a Friday afternoon, you most likely get an answering service to
tell you to call back on Monday,'' Chapman said.
   ``You can imagine what that does to someone who has reached that
point of being willing to break with that drug habit,'' Chapman
said.
   But Chapman said that he was aware of only one community, Miami,
where such a service is being planned. The Miami program has not
been implemented because the local government has yet to help
finance it, Chapman said.

<HEAD>Plight of Orphaned Wolf Pups Hits at Montanans' Heart</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Offers of food for six orphaned wolf pups
are pouring in from Montanans moved by the animals' plight, but
officials say the 4{-month-old animals are making do with some help
from the government.
   ``The response has been amazing,'' said Ed Bangs, head of the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's project to restore wolves in
Montana.
   The animals, protected by the Endangered Species Act, are part
of a federal program to establish 10 breeding pairs of wolves in
Montana.
   One woman wanted to donate venison steaks from her freezer.
Another had some chickens she didn't need. A man offered to set up
a guard station to protect the pups in the Ninemile Valley west of
Missoula.
   Bangs turned them all down.
   The pups are doing fine on road-killed animals and the surplus
deer meat that officials are providing from the Lee Metcalf
National Wildlife Refuge, said Mike Jimenez, the wildlife biologist
who has monitored the litter since spring.
   Jimenez said the pups spend their days chasing grasshoppers,
field mice and gophers. They weigh about 50 pounds and are about
the size of German shepherds.
   The pups' mother was illegally shot to death last summer. The
father fed and protected them until he was hit by a car on
Interstate 90 two weeks ago.
   Federal officials then stepped in, but the animals will be back
on their own by winter when they'll have to start killing their own
game, Bangs said.
   He says some of them probably won't survive, falling victim to
starvation, mountain lions or hunters' stray bullets.
   ``The pups will have more hard knocks than if there was an adult
protecting them,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   On her first day back to school,
7-year-old Wanda colored a mimeographed counting exercise, ate a
hamburger for lunch and took the No. 4 bus home - to a city
shelter.
   For Wanda, and for the thousands of other homeless children,
just going back to school can be a lesson in survival.
   ``These kids have gone through a lot by the time they get into
the classroom,'' said Michelle Linehan, director of the state
Department of Education's Office for Education of Homeless Children
in Boston.
   ``They're not homeless because they want to be,'' said Glenwood
Elementary Principal Robert Kelliher, whose school is near the
motel-shelter where Wanda lives. ``They want the same thing as
other youngsters, a bed to sleep in at night ... a place to study,
a place to play.''
   As of November, 12,000 children were living in Massachusetts
shelters, half of them school age, Linehan said. ``That's only the
numbers that we know of,'' she said.
   The U.S. Department of Education estimated that at the end of
last year, 200,000 of the 272,000 homeless children attended
schools.
   Problems facing homeless children range from ragged clothes and
no place to study to poor self esteem. Families driven to shelters
by house fires often have trouble tracking down duplicates of birth
certificates and immunization records required for school
admission.
   Shelters report that more than 10 percent of their school-age
children do not go to school and tests show that they have a harder
time in the classroom.
   ``A lot of them are tired because they're living in crowded
conditions. They seem distant,'' said Arlene Tanous, who works with
homeless children for the Springfield Action Commission.
   For many parents, the chief concern is keeping their chldren in
the school they attended before homelessness struck.
   The alternative is a fractured education, said Kelliher,
recounting the story of a third-grader who had moved 13 times.
Kelliher persuaded school officials to find money for private
transportation back to Glenwood if the boy moved again.
   ``I was informed the other day that he's moved,'' Kelliher said.
``Utica, New York.''
   A 1987 federal law gives children of homeless families the
choice of going to the school in their last district or one closer
to the shelter. However, the law doesn't provide for transportation
to the old school.
   Then there's the stigma of homelessness.
   Desiree, a fourth grader, doesn't tell her friends that
financial problems led to a change of address over the summer.
   ``I just told her if anybody asks you where you're staying,
you're just staying with a friend,'' said her mother, Naomi, who
spoke on condition that her last name not be used.
   Dealing with that sort of problem is one of the functions of
Linehan's office, founded three years ago with an administrative
budget of about $90,000 a year.
   In addition to collecting information and applying for grants
for such things as home tutoring programs for the homeless,
Linehan's office has prepared guidelines for teachers.
   ``It's just things such as being aware that if you have birthday
parties, this kid may not be able to bring a treat so be aware of
that,'' Linehan said. Teachers also should beware of the importance
a homeless child may attach to seemingly meaningless possessions.
   ``When I used to teach, if a kid came in with a little car,
after the third warning (not to play with it in class) it used to
go in the bottom drawer until after May. You just can't do that to
a homeless kid. It can devastate them,'' she said.
   At 7, Wanda is too young to worry about her classmates finding
out where she lives. But her older sister, 12-year-old Wakena,
isn't. Wakena, scheduled to start at a junior high school this
fall, wasn't too sure last week if she wanted to go.
   ``Some of those kids are cracking on (teasing) you,'' she said.
``About clothes, you know, like $50 sneakers.''
   The junior high would be her sixth or seventh school, she said.
   ``We went to a lot of schools. We never finished a year,'' she
said.
   The family has had a succession of living arrangements during
the past six years, said her mother, Betty Foster. She said she
hopes to get more assistance from the state to get out of the
motel-shelter and into an apartment.
   ``I want them to have good education. You got to find some kind
of opportunity,'' she said. ``I tell them, `What are you going to
do, clean somebody's bathroom?' ''

<HEAD>Recession Fears Grow with Soaring Trade Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. merchandise trade deficit soared 75
percent in July for its steepest increase in eight years, the
government said, renewing recessionary fears even before the
effects of the Persian Gulf crisis are felt.
   The Commerce Department said the deficit totaled $9.33 billion,
up sharply from $5.34 billion in June and the worst imbalance since
last January's $10.2 billion. The surge was the largest since the
shortfall jumped 205 percent to $5.5 billion in August 1982, a
spokesman said.
   Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher noted the July report
contained the last trade data unaffected by the disruptions caused
by the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   ``The rise in oil prices since then is likely to increase the
average trade deficit for the last five months by an amount in
excess of $2 billion per month,'' Mosbacher said.
   In addition to the effects of the oil-price shock, many private
analysts pointed to a 6.4 percent decline in exports in July and
questioned whether much improvement was in the offing.
   Over the past three years, fully one-third of overall U.S.
economic growth has been supplied by surging export sales. That had
become even more important recently as consumer spending faded in
the face of adverse economic news.
   But Mark M. Zandi, an economist with Regional Financial
Associates in West Chester, Pa., said high interest rates and
slower economic growth overseas are ``going to take a bite out of
our export picture,'' he said.
   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a New
York securities dealer, added that ``while it's unlikely the trade
numbers will continue to look as bad as they did in July, they do
give us a hint that we have come to the end of major improvements
in trade.''
   In fact, the United States had a deficit of $1.33 billion with
Western Europe because of falling exports, after posting a surplus
of $806 million in June.
   ``Exports have been the only area of strength in the economy for
several years now,'' said Bruce Steinberg, senior economist for
Merrill Lynch in New York. ``If they fall, there's no area of
strength and that's very bothersome.''
   Exports, which posted a record $34.3 billion in June, fell to
$32.0 billion in July. Imports jumped 4.5 percent to $41.4 billion.
The deficit is the difference between the two.
   Nevertheless, Mosbacher said exports were up 8.1 percent during
the first seven months of the year while imports rose just 3.3
percent, meaning the 1990 deficit was running at an annual rate of
$95.0 billion. The deficit last year totaled $109.40 billion.
   He remained optimistic that the non-oil deficit - which he
called ``a better indicator of international competitiveness'' -
would decline further from the current $45.8 billion rate.
   Oil imports in July rose 7.9 prcent to $3.98 billion, but that
was due to increased volume rather than prices. Americans imported
8.85 million barrels a day, up from 8.40 million in June, while the
average price per barrel edged down from $14.64 to $14.50.
   Since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, however, crude oil
prices have surpassed $33 a barrel.
   Exports slipped in part because of a $500 million drop in
aircraft shipments. But decreases also were posted in all major
categories - capital goods, foods, automobiles, industrial supplies
and consumer goods.
   At the same time, consumer and capital goods, automobiles and
industrial supplies added to the import total.
   As usual, the biggest deficit was with Japan, a $2.97 billion
imbalance, down from a $3.07 billion deficit in June.
   Other deficits included Taiwan, $1.14 billion; China, $1.13
billion; Canada, $992 million; Brazil, $335 million; Korea, $623
million, and Hong Kong, $439 million.

   Americans are growing increasingly
disenchanted with the two major political parties, associating
Republicans with wealth and greed and Democrats with incompetence
according to a survey released Tuesday.
   ``Since 1987, there has been a significant upswing in feelings
of mistrust of political leaders, disillusionment with politics and
feelings of powerlessness,'' said the Times Mirror survey
titled``The People, the Press &amp; Politics 1990.''
   The study said the growing cynicism and economic polarization
among all but the wealthiest Americans ``threatens to subvert
traditional partisan politics or block the effective resolution of
social and economic issues.''
   Another finding was that while ``anti-communism is fading as a
factor in American politics, anti-Japanese sentiment has soared as
economic expectations plummet.'' Equally dramatic was the decline
in support for Israel.
   ``Dislike for the Japanese has become more mainstream,''
concluded the survey. ``It is no longer primarily concentrated
among the kinds of people who have been hit especially hard by
Japanese competition.''
   ``Growing dislike for Israel is evident across all demographic,
political and social groups, except among American Jews,'' the
survey said. But it also said that ``It is important to note that
the sharp decline in identification with Israel has not been
accompanied by a substantial identification with the causes of the
Palestinians.''
   President Bush fared as well in this as in other recent surveys,
with 76 percent giving him very or mostly favorable ratings.
   The findings were based on face-to-face interviews in May with
3,004 adults. A random sample of 1,000 was reinterviewed between
Aug. 19 and 25. The responses for the overall sample had a margin
of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.
   The responses were analyzed by Princeton Research Associates and
compared to the findings of a similar study conducted in 1987.
   In the three years between the two studies, there was little
change in Americans' affiliation with the major parties - the
number of people identifying themselves as Republicans increased 3
percentage points, while those calling themselves Democrats
declined 4 points.
   The survey found 33 percent of the respondents called themselves
Democrats, 28 percent Republicans and 39 percent independents.
   ``Beneath this surface stability however, there are volatile
forces at work,'' said the study. It concluded that ``both parties
have declined precipitously in the public's estimation.''
   Even among people who are the strongest supporters of the
Democratic Party, the party was viewed as ``incapable of governing
America successfully and unclear on what it should stand for.''
   Despite the Republican success at holding the White House, the
survey concluded the party ``has been unable to capitalize on these
declining Democratic fortunes because the GOP itself is now seen by
a majority of the public as the political instrument of the
nation's rich and powerful.''
   Democratic Party chairman Ronald H. Brown said, ``I'm not at all
disheartened by those findings.'' He noted that the survey was
conducted at a time when the Republican president has very high
approval ratings, but that nonetheless it ``reinforces the point
that we've been trying to get across, namely, that the Republican
Party is the party of the privileged few.''
   Brown said his party must do a better job of getting across the
point that Republicans ``have been in charge of government for the
last decade. It hasn't been Democrats, and Republicans have failed
totally in managing this government.''
   The latest survey found growth in the already large numbers of
Americans feeling alienated from their government.
   Among the findings were these:
   -- Thirty percent said they agreed completely with the statement
that ``generally speakng, elected officials in Washington often
lose touch with the people pretty quickly.'' Three years ago, 22
percent agreed completely.
   -- The majority that felt people like themselves have no say in
what government does grew from 52 percent in 1987 to 57 percent in
1990.
   -- The number of people who said that elected officials care
what they think declined from 47 percent to 44 percent.
   -- Thirty-eight percent said they agreed completely with the
statement ``It's really true, the rich get richer and the poor get
poorer.'' That was an increase from 31 percent in 1987.
   Drugs far outstripped other matters when people were asked to
list the most important problems facing the nation.
   Thirty-six percent cited drugs, compared to 11 percent three
years ago. The federal deficit was named by 11 percent, the same
proportion as in 1987. Homelessness and the environment each were
listed by 8 percent. Fewer than 1 percent named either matter three
years ago.
   The proportion of people willing to spend more money to combat
drugs increased from 66 percent in 1987 to 73 percent this year.
   In both surveys, 67 percent said they would be willing to spend
more for the homeless and 35 percent would approve more funds to
aid blacks and other minorities.
   On abortion, the survey found 55 percent saying they opposed
restrictions on access to abortions. However, among Republicans and
those who lean to the GOP, 47 percent opposed restrictions and 48
percent favored them. Democrats and those inclined to support the
party opposed restrictions by a margin of 62 percent to 33 percent.
   When asked about attitudes toward Japan, 56 percent gave a
favorable opinion and 39 percent unfavorable. Three years ago, 69
percent viewed Japan favorably and 27 percent unfavorably.
   The greatest increases in unfavorable opinion toward the
Japanese occurred among whites, men, upper income earners and those
in the Western United States, the survey found.
   On Israel, 44 percent rated the country favorably and 45 percent
unfavorably. Three years ago, the split was 65 percent favorable
and 27 percent unfavorable.

<HEAD>Guatemala a `Drug Problem' Country, US Officials Say</HEAD>

   A sharp increase in opium production in
Guatemala has prompted the State Department to add that country to
its list of ``drug problem'' countries, an administration official
said Tuesday.
   According to official estimates, the Guatemala acreage devoted
to opium is sufficient for a 12-ton yield. Any country with a yield
of 5 tons or more is automatically placed on the State Department
list.
   The official, who asked not to be identified, said that
inclusion on the list does not constitute criticism of Guatemala's
efforts to curb drug trafficking.
   He said smugglers send raw opium from Guatemala to Mexico where
it is refined into heroin for shipment to the United States.
   Guatemala joins 10 other Latin American and Caribbean countries
on the list - Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador, Jamaica, the Bahamas,
Belize, Paraguay, Ecuador, Bolivia and Panama. Fourteen Asian and
Middle Eastern countries are also on the list.
   The only other hemispheric country where there is sizeable opium
production is Mexico. But production in Mexico and Guatemala is
minuscule next to such countries as Burma, Afghanistan, Iran and
Laos, according to official statistics..
   The U.S. Embassy spokesman in Guatemala City, James Dickmeyer,
said the Guatemalan government has tried to curb opium poppy and
marijuana production and to curtail cocaine shipments from
Colombia.
   Diplomatic sources said President Vinicio Cerezo is being urged
to use the Guatemalan military to stop cocaine trafficking through
Guatemala.
   Two prominent citizens were killed recently in what appeared to
be incidents linked to drug trafficking.
   Heavily armed men shot banker Ramiro Castillo Love to death at
his home on Aug. 24.
   ``He refused to launder drug money,'' former vice president
Mario Sandoval Alarcon, a friend of Castillo's, said.
   Danilo Barillas, head of a commission investigating corruption
in the Christian Democrat party and widely believed to have found
links to the Colombian cartels, was killed on Aug. 1.

<TEXT>
   The Seabrook nuclear power plant has been
allowed to go into full operation within three miles of a popular
beach without adequate plans for evacuation in the event of
disaster, the U.S. Court of Appeals was told Tuesday.
   As opponents of the plant demonstrated outside, the court heard
arguments on the petition of Massachusetts officials and
environmental groups to revoke the license issued for the New
Hampshire facility.
   The plant was licensed by the commission in March after nearly
two decades of court challenges and thousands of arrests in mass
demonstrations. It began operations last month.
   Lawyers for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the New
Hampshire Public Service Company, principal owner of the plant,
defended the licensing, saying the NRC followed long-established
principles that provided substantial protection. They said there
was no way to know in advance just how much protection would be
adequate.
   ``The idea is to create a plan that provides some measure of
protection to the people,'' said John F. Cordes Jr., attorney for
the NRC. He said the procedures were not designed to permit the
commission to ``revisit'' a site decision once it was made.
   Judge Stephen F. Williams, a member of the three-judge panel
that heard the arguments, asked if this meant that ``you do the
best you can in the circumstances if that means distributing Bibles
and suicide pills.''
   Cordes replied that the commission's rules would allow it to
change its procedures if it were ``faced with a site where it
believed no one could be evacuated and there was no shelter.''
   ``That is not remotely the case at Seabrook,'' he said.
   Robert A. Backus, representing two citizens' groups opposed to
the plant, said the nearby beach attracts at least 50,000 people on
fine summer days. He said the only shelters available are motels,
cottages and structures such as ice cream parlors with screened
porches.
   Although there is one interstate highway in the area, most of
the potential escape routes are two-lane roads, he said. He said
traffic jams in the area sometimes last for as long as seven hours.
   He said the commission failed to follow its procedures in
approving an evacuation plan for people living in 17 New Hampshire
communities and six in neighboring Massachusetts.
   ``The commission did not make a judgment on whether or not there
were adequate evacuation plans,'' Backus told the court.
   ``They basically made a judgment without looking at the
evidence,'' said John Traficante, assistant Massachusetts attorney
general. ``We are not saying they drew the wrong line. We are
saying they drew no line.''
   Traficante argued that the commission relied on ``a check list
that doesn't have any teeth.'' On this basis, he said, it ``could
approve a site on 42nd and Broadway'' in New York.
   Cordes said the commission's procedures assured that there would
be ``a full measure of planning'' for an emergency and that this
``would be substantial protection'' for the public.
   ``This is not a secret approach,'' he said. ``It's nothing
mysterious.''
   Thomas G. Dignan Jr., representing the owners, argued, ``The
adequacy (of an evacuation plan) is something that will never be
determined at a nuclear site until the day of the accident.''
   He said it would depend on such things as the nature of the
accident and the wind direction at the time.
   Judges James F. Buckley and A. Raymond Randolph are the other
members of the panel, which will rule later on the petition.
   Stephen B. Comley of Rowley, Mass., a leader of the
demonstration that was held outside, said a similar demonstration
is planned for Wednesday at the headquarters of the NRC.
   Ron Sher, spokesman for New Hampshire Yankee, Seabrook's
operator, said by telephone from Seabrook Station, ``It is ironic
and unfortunate that opponents continue to try to stop the
operation of Seabrook when Seabrook is generating electricity and
displacing the need to burn more than a million and a half barrels
of oil a month.''

<HEAD>U.S. Said On Brink of Paying $200 Million Tehran Claim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ABNER KATZMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is on the verge
of paying a $200 million claim brought by Iran, Western diplomats
said Tuesday. The payment would pave the way for the resolution of
a decade-old dispute.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
settlement of the claim, stemming from Iranian payments made on
undelivered U.S. weaponry, was imminent.
   The case is part of the Foreign Military Sales claim being
arbitrated here by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal. The
9-year-old tribunal is charged with arbitrating all commercial and
government-to-government claims between the two nations arising
from the 1979 Iranian revolution and the ensuing expropriations and
broken contracts.
   Iran has set the total military sales claim, involving 1,200
cases in all, at $11 billion, a figure the U.S. government says is
inflated.
   Once the case involving the undelivered weaponry is settled, the
$200 million will be deposited in the so-called security account
from which money is paid out to claimants at the tribunal. The
money is now in a trust fund.
   Another case close to being settled involves weapons that Iran
had sent to the United States for repairs but never got back. The
weapons were impounded by the U.S. government after the 1979
seizing of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by Islamic militants.
   The sources would not give a time frame for settlement of this
case nor put a dollar amount on it, but the settlement is believed
to amount to up to $300 million.
   ``The agreement is we're paying them an agreed-upon value for
the equipment and we get to keep it,'' said a Western diplomat.
   The military equipment impounded by the U.S. government includes
several airplanes, airplane engines and even a World War II-era
diesel-powered submarine now in the Philadelphia Navy Yard.
   At the time of the revolution, Iran had large numbers of
warplanes and several destroyers on order in the United States, but
those were canceled by mutual agreement in light of the freeze on
military transfers.
   The largest foreign military sales claim is Iran's $5 billion
demand for damages resulting from the U.S. government's refusal to
license exports of weaponry and other military material Tehran had
ordered. The Iranian government has never explained precisely how
it arrived at that figure.
   But Tehran has on several occasions said that return of its
assets held by the United States was a pre-condition for its
intervention on behalf of Western hostages held in Lebanon. The
captors of the 13 known Western hostages are believed to be
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militants.
   However, a Western diplomat said the foreign military sales
negotiation process is ``completely internal to the tribunal. It
has nothing to do with any outside events, including hostages and
the Iraq-Kuwait situation.''
   The tribunal is the only official forum for contacts between the
United States and Iran. It was set up in 1980.

<HEAD>Gulf Oil Shock Sends Inflation Soaring; Trade Deficit Worsens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Skyrocketing oil costs pushed retail prices up
a sharp 0.8 percent last month as the Persian Gulf crisis began
hitting Americans' wallets, the government said Tuesday.
   The seasonally adjusted increase in the Labor Department's
Consumer Price Index was double the 0.4 percent rise in July and
the largest since January, when a severe cold snap pushed prices up
1.1 percent.
   In a separate report signalling slackening economic growth, the
Commerce Department reported the sharpest increase in the trade
deficit since August 1982. Americans imported $9.33 billion more
than they exported in July, up 75 percent from June.
   Analysts said the trade deterioration was particularly worrisome
because it was recorded before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait
sent oil prices, and thus the value of U.S. imports, spiraling.
   ``We're looking at the worst of all possible worlds for the
economy: worsening inflation and slower growth,'' said economist
David Jones of Aubrey J. Lanston &amp; Co., a government securities
dealer in New York.
   Financial markets turned down in response to the double dose of
bad news.
   For the first eight months of 1990, prices rose at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 6.2 percent, up sharply from the 4.6
percent rise for all of 1989.
   ``Inflation is now at the worst pace in eight years,'' said
economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch. ``It is the worst since
1982, when the economy was coming out of double-digit inflation.''
   The department attributed nearly half of the August increase to
energy costs, up 4.3 percent. Gasoline prices rose 7.6 percent,
while fuel oil prices jumped 15.4 percent after six consecutive
declines. It was the steepest increase in both categories since
January.
   Food inflation, however, moderated. Prices, held back by a
decline in fruit and vegetable costs, rose 0.3 percent, the
smallest since May. Fresh fruit prices tumbled 4 percent, but dairy
costs rose 1.3 percent. Prices in other food categories also
increased.
   Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, prices rose a
seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent after a 0.6 percent increase in
July. That translates into an annual core inflation rate of more
than 6 percent, a persistently high rate to accompany an economic
slowdown, analysts said.
   They believe more bad news is coming in the next several months.
Crude oil prices have continued to rise in September, topping $33 a
barrel this month, compared with an average of $20 in July. That
will work its way through to the gasoline pump.
   Also, increases are ahead for chemicals, paint, plastics and
other petroleum-based products, said economist Allen Sinai of the
Boston Co.
   ``The chain of effects of oil inflation is massive through the
economy. We calculate that 75 percent to 80 percent of the items in
the consumer index ultimately are affected by oil,'' he said.
   However, many analysts believe economic growth is too slow and
demand too weak to support a sustained inflation burst if oil
prices stabilize.
   In another report, the Labor Department said Americans'
inflation-adjusted earnings fell a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent
in August. Earnings fell 0.5 percent in each of the two preceding
months.
   In other details of price activity in August, housing costs rose
0.7 percent and transportation was up 1.8 percent. Both were driven
by rising energy prices, with gasoline accounting for nearly 90
percent of the transportation rise.
   Medical care rose 0.9 percent, in line with a long string of
sharp increases; tobacco was up 0.3 percent after having risen more
than 2 percent in both July and June; clothing and upkeep costs
were up a slight 0.1 percent.
   The various changes put the index for all consumer goods at
131.6 in August. That means that a hypothetical selection of goods
costing $100 in the 1982-84 base period would have cost $131.60 in
August, up $7 from a year earlier. The index numbers are not
adjusted for seasonal variations.
   The recent combination of oil-induced inflation and slow
economic growth has put monetary policymakers in a quandary. The
Federal Reserve Board normally pushes interest rates higher to
fight inflation and lower to stimulate lagging growth.
   ``It just poses the worst possible dilemma,'' Jones said. ``Fed
policymakers are likely to keep policy unchanged while they let the
dust settle from the Middle East explosion.''

   A judge reversed himself Tuesday and
released a 77-year-old woman from prison, conceding that her eight
days behind bars failed to force her to reveal the whereabouts of
her daughter and granddaughters.
   ``I can't imagine what will be more coercive than what the court
has done in the past few days,'' Superior Court Judge Mark A.
Pfeiffer said. ``I hope somehow you can look into your heart and
your conscience and understand what is being done here.''
   Mary Pigeon has insisted she does not know where to find her
daughter. Her daughter, Elaine Yates, disappeared after a dispute
with her husband five years ago.
   ``I feel much better,'' Mrs. Pigeon said after Pfeiffer's
decision. ``I would win everything if my daughter and grandchildren
would come home.''
   She then went to her Warwick home.
   Mrs. Pigeon returned to court Tuesday on a request by the
Corrections Department to confine her to home rather than keep her
in prison. The request became moot with her release.
   Pfeiffer did not revoke his earlier order requiring Mrs. Pigeon
to provide information about her daughter and granddaughters
Kimberly, 8, and Kelly, 5.
   Mrs. Pigeon's son-in-law, Russell M. Yates Jr., believes Mrs.
Pigeon knows where Mrs. Yates took the children when she
disappeared from their Warwick home.
   Mrs. Yates left in 1985 after she found her husband with another
woman aboard the family's boat. Yates, who did not attend Tuesday's
hearing, has acknowledged hitting his wife and cutting her forehead
with a ring, and that he had an affair with another woman.
   He won custody of the children when Mrs. Yates failed to show up
to contest it. He sued Mrs. Pigeon after the custody hearing in an
effort to find his daughters.
   After Pfeiffer concluded Mrs. Pigeon knew where her daughter is,
he ordered her to pay a $23,000 fine. She has yet to pay it, but
did comply with a later order to do 150 hours of community service.
   The judge's decision last week to send Mrs. Pigeon to prison
provoked widespread criticism from women's groups, Gov. Edward D.
DiPrete and others.
   Neil Philbin, Yates' lawyer, said he disagreed with the judge's
latest decision but added, ``I'm confident Judge Pfeiffer ruled as
his conscience guided him.''
   Pfeiffer said he would listen to any ideas from Philbin about
further penalties, but added he didn't know what else could be
done.

   A pattern of ``widespread murder'' by government
security forces appears to be continuing in Sri Lanka, Amnesty
International said in a report released Wednesday.
   In northeastern Sri Lanka, where government forces are battling
Tamil separatists, ``hundreds of defenseless civilians may have
been victims of extra-judicial execution or `disappearances,''' the
report said.
   ``Indeed, the government appears to condone the summary killing
of suspected (Tamil Tiger) members,'' it added.
   As many as 30,000 people are believed to have died in 1988 and
1989 in the south of Sri Lanka, where the government faced
Sinhalese rebels, the report said.
   ``Although reports of extra-judicial executions and
`disappearances' in southern Sri Lanka diminished after March 1990,
they did not cease, and intimidation and death threats by
government forces continued,'' the international human rights
organization said.
   ``With the renewed heavy fighting between government and the
Tamil Tigers ... in the northeast since June, Amnesty International
fears the pervasive pattern of violations is continuing.''
   The human rights group said the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna
opposition, Tamil separatists and the Indian peacekeeping force
deployed in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990 were all guilty of
serious human rights abuses.
   In the south, where the dominant group is Sinhalese, the
government is opposed by the armed Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, or
People's Liberation Front. In the northeast the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam, or Tamil Tigers, are fighting for a separate Tamil
state.
   Fighting continues in the northeast, and more than 300,000
people have fled their homes in the Jaffna district, Amnesty
International said.
   Since 1987, the report said, the United National Party
government of President Ranasinghe Premadasa had apparently allowed
its security forces to ruthlessly suppress armed opposition.
   ``Thousands of people have `disappeared' or been killed at the
hands of security forces in recent years in the south and hundreds
more have fallen victim to this violence in the latest wave of
repression in the northeast,'' Amnesty International said.
   ``Entire communities have been attacked in retaliation for
opposition violence and many people have been arbitrarily rounded
up, and sometimes killed, on the basis of anonymous accusations of
subversive involvement,'' it said.
   For example, in June, government soldiers who had regained
control of the town of Kalmunai after the Tamil Tigers left it
``rounded up many young men, stabbed them to death with bayonets,
and burned their bodies in shops,'' said the report.
   ``Elsewhere in the east, patients taken from hospital and
refugees from camps have `disappeared,''' it said.
   Since 1987 the security forces had killed under many guises: in
uniform, in plainclothes operations attributed to ``vigilantes,''
and in death squads, Amnesty International said.
   ``The government has fueled this violence by handing the
security forces extraordinary powers,'' said the report.

   The Pentagon has assigned three cargo planes
to carry relief supplies to refugees arriving in Jordan from Iraq
and will fly more than 400 of them to their home countries, a
Defense Department spokesman said Tuesday.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said three cargo aircraft - two
C-5s and a C-141 - will fly the relief missions over the next
several days.
   The C-141, scheduled to leave McGuire Air Force Base in New
Jersey on Wednesday, will ferry refugees to their home countries of
Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and the Philippines after unloading relief
cargo in Jordan, Williams said.
   He said that on its initial flight from the United States the
aircraft would stop in Copenhagen, Denmark, to pick up some 20 tons
of tents, blankets and other supplies from UNICEF.
   After unloading its cargo in Jordan it will fly three
repatriation missions carrying about 420 displaced people to their
home countries.
   Williams said the first C-5 left Andrews Air Force Base in
suburban Maryland last weekend and would deliver relief supplies to
Jordan after a stopover in Pakistan to deliver a similar cargo for
Afghanistan.
   The second C-5 aircraft was set to leave Dover Air Force Base,
Del., on Tuesday to fly excess Defense Department cots and 5,000
privately donated blankets to Amman, the Jordanian capital.
   Williams said the supplies will be distributed by relief
organizations in Jordan.

<HEAD>Iraq Trying to Break Kuwaitis' Will, Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEIL MacFARQUHAR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KHAFJI, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq's erratic opening of the border
with Saudi Arabia appeared to be part of a harsh campaign to break
the Kuwaiti people's will to resist, Kuwaiti officials, diplomats
and refugees said Tuesday.
   Over the past week Iraqi authorities have introduced a series of
measures that have put the population on edge, they said. They
range from the trivial - like making men shave - to blowing up
houses of suspected resistance members.
   ``They are trying to break our morale, to make us weak,'' said
Faisal, a 27-year-old computer programmer who fled Kuwait Tuesday.
``They want us just to give up.''
   Faisal was one of about 750 refugees who made it to the Saudi
border crossing at Khafji Tuesday, a steep drop from the thousands
who arrived the two previous days. On Monday, Iraqi troops started
seizing men under the age of 40 at random from cars. That sharply
reduced the numbers attempting to leave.
   Also, fewer cars were being permitted across the border. Just
one vehicle with a sick, elderly man in it was allowed over in
midafternoon.
   The family in that car said all others were told to return to
Kuwait City and try again Wednesday.
   The haphazard releases appear designed ``to cause general
consternation and upset the people,'' said a Western diplomat
observing the border in case any of his nationals made it through.
   Saudi police expelled reporters from the border area Tuesday
afternoon before conducting a second thorough search of the
hundreds of people who arrived over the past three days without a
single identity document.
   Iraqi troops have confiscated passports, car registrations and
all other documents they found.
   A team of four dogs trained to sniff explosives and narcotics
assisted in the Saudi search.
   Kuwaiti government officials questioned the refugees closely to
check their accents, family ties and knowledge of Kuwait. Saudi
officials have said they want to make sure no infiltrators make it
through.
   A senior official from the Kuwaiti defense department said Iraq
over the past week had intensified its efforts to break any
resistance, find all foreigners still hiding in Kuwait, infiltrate
the Kuwaiti population with intelligence agents and seize as much
private property as possible.
   The official, who had just returned from Kuwait, said the
campaign stalled resistance plans to leave car bombs throughout the
city.
   ``We cannot move like in earlier days,'' he said, noting that
checkpoints were put up every 300 yards, sometimes closer in
neighborhoods of suspected resistance activity.
   Each checkpoint now had at least one Republican Guard, the
best-trained Iraqi troops, assigned to it in the past week, he
said.
   One refugee arrived at the border crossing with a flier released
two days ago by the Iraqi authorities.
   It was directed at both the armed resistance and the civil
disobedience campaign. All Kuwaitis in essential services have
refused to go to work.
   The flier ordered everyone to return to work or face heavy
fines. Shops would be opened by force, it said.
   Police and military officers are to turn themselves in within a
week or face execution.
   Anyone caught firing a gun will be hanged or shot, it said.
   Anyone found keeping a weapon will have his house ``destroyed on
his head,'' the flier said. And if the authorities confirm shooting
from any house the area 360 degrees around it will be leveled.
   The defense department official said the past week saw a marked
jump in executions, house-to-house searches with the entire
neighborhood sealed off and a higher level of overall harassment.
   ``The situation is misery,'' said Massoud, a 38-year-old
refugee. Like most of those arriving here he appeared somewhat
relieved that he would no longer have to run a daily gauntlet of
Iraqi soldiers. But he was confused and depressed about whether he
made the right decision to flee his country and abandon it to the
Iraqis.
   ``When they invaded, they said they came to protect us,'' the
defense department official said. ``Now their mood has changed and
they are trying to kill the Kuwaiti people.''
   Many refugees spoke of executions over the past week. None could
be independently confirmed but the details of the stories were
similar.
   Farouk Mohammadi, 45, said he fled after the corpses of two
cousins and a friend were returned to their houses two weeks after
they were hauled away, accused of taking part in the resistance.
   The crackdown was pushing people to flee because they were
terrorized about stepping outside but going crazy from inactivity
indoors.
   ``Every Kuwaiti is swimming in a sea of horror,'' he said.

<HEAD>Quayle Says `Berlin Wall' Of Rules In School System Should Be
Removed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

   Vice President Dan Quayle said Tuesday public
schools must dismantle a ``Berlin Wall'' of rules that allow them
to operate like a communist, state-run monopoly.
   Educators should take a lesson from ``the failure of socialized
economies in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union,'' Quayle said.
   He called for wider efforts to give parents choice in public
education and vouchers to allow them to choose between public and
private schools.
   He had in mind vouchers paid for by state and local governments,
not Washington.
   Addressing a Hudson Institute forum at the National Press Club,
the vice president said, ``The people of Eastern Europe are
throwing out these (government-controlled) systems, and the people
of the Soviet Union, hopefully, are not far behind. It is now time
to apply this lesson to our own education system.''
   ``Unfortunately, the education establishment has succeeded in
putting our school system behind a `Berlin Wall' ... of rules and
regulations that stifle ingenuity and limit competition,'' he
charged.
   Parents are denied free choice in selecting their children's
school, he said; schools lack the freedom to hire the most talented
staff, and teachers cannot choose the best curriculum.
   ``Our schools are robbed of the benefits of flexibility and
competition ... that are enjoyed in virtually every other sector of
our society,'' he said.
   The American economy ``flourishes because it operates in a free
market. Our school system is declining because it is a centrally
planned monopoly,'' said Quayle, who sends his three children to
private schools. They attended Fairfax County, Va., public schools
when their father was a senator.
   Quayle praised Minnesota's public school choice program and a
state-backed experiment in Milwaukee giving up to 1,000 poor
children a chance to choose any public school or a $2,500 voucher
toward tuition at a private school.
   Quayle met earlier with Polly Williams, a Democratic state
representative from Milwaukee spearheading that effort to promote
choice.
   He said he will campaign in Oregon next week for a initiative on
the November ballot giving Oregonians a similar choice among
schools.
   ``Let's give the education establishment and the politicians a
little wake-up call,'' said Quayle.
   Public schools now enroll more than 88 percent of the nation's
46 million schoolchildren, private schools just under 12 percent,
according to government figures.

<HEAD>Former Secret Police Chief is Target of Criminal Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's former secret police chief
arranged contacts between Palestinian terrorists and West Germany's
notorious Red Army Faction terror gang in the late 1980s, West
German prosecutors said Tuesday.
   The legacy of the hated secret police, or Stasi, has become the
No. 1 political theme in East Germany and is increasingly spilling
over into West Germany.
   In Bonn, there was a political stalemate over amnesty for the
Stasi's spy corps. That raised the specter of a wave of arrests on
German unification day, Oct. 3.
   Since the fall of East German leader Erich Honecker, there have
been nearly continuous disclosures about his Communist government's
alleged support for terrorism. The latest such disclosure concerns
imprisoned former secret police chief Erich Mielke, 82, and his
former deputy, Gerhard Neiber.
   Both are suspected of having harbored members of West Germany's
leftist terrorist Red Army Faction, West Germany's top-ranking
prosecutor Alexander von Stahl said Tuesday. He said a criminal
investigation was under way.
   East German police, working with their West German colleagues,
rounded up nine Red Army Faction terrorist suspects in June. They
had been living in East Germany under assumed names.
   The Red Army Faction has waged a deadly campaign against West
German businesses, military facilties and other targets.
   In 1987 and 1988, the Stasi helped put Red Army Faction members
in touch with the Palestine Liberation Organization, the chief
prosecutor said.
   There were no further details of the alleged ties to the
Palestinians, although such links have long been suspected. The
former Communist government once trained small cadres of
Palestinians at a military school along East Germany's northern
coast.
   The prosecutors also accused Mielke and Neiber of being
responsible for harboring a rightist terrorist from West Germany.
The suspect, whose name was not disclosed, had fled to East
Germany. He was later convicted of attempted murder.
   Proof of the allegations is contained in nearly 200 pages of
documents seized from the former secret police, von Stahl said in a
statement. A spokesman, Hans-Juergen Foerster, said ``it's still
too early to tell'' when or whether Mielke or Neiber will be
brought to trial.
   Von Stahl, in a television interview Monday night, also said he
believed East German secret police were involved in the bombing of
West Berlin's La Belle discotheque in April 1986.
   That bombing led to the U.S. air raids on the Libyan cities of
Tripoli and Benghazi 10 days later, after Washington blamed Libya
for the attack. The La Belle attack killed two U.S. soldiers and a
Turkish woman.
   The disco was a popular spot for American servicemen in West
Berlin.
   In West Berlin, Justice Department spokesman Cornel Christoffel
said the Stasi had an inside agent who provided the East German
secret police with information before the attack. However, he said
he could not confirm that the Stasi played an active role in the La
Belle bombing.
   Honecker himself is the target of several criminal
investigations, including one in West Germany for obstruction of
justice. The obstruction of justice allegations against the
78-year-old Honecker stem from support for fugitive West German
leftist terrorists.
   In East Germany, the embattled interior minister predicted a new
round of disclosures of alleged secret police ties, this time
targeting himself and Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere.
   Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel said such reports would
be ``defamatory.'' Diestel has already denied rumors he once held
the rank of major in the Stasi.
   Several hundred people took to the streets in the East German
cities of Dresden and Schwerin to demand access to the files of the
disbanded Stasi.
   In the city of Chemnitz, the local leader of the German Social
Union was kicked out of the party. Officials said they had proof
that the leader, Helmut-Joachim Nestler had been a Stasi
collaborator from 1975 to 1985.

<HEAD>US Rebukes Jordan For Hosting Conference of Radicals</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said Tuesday it expects
Jordan will end its continuing purchases of Iraqi oil and also
blasted that country for hosting a conference that featured the
Arab world's most radical anti-American elements.
   According to official estimates, Jordan formerly imported 90 per
cent of its oil requirements from Iraq but has reduced that figure
to 40 per cent since the United Nations economic embargo against
Iraq went into effect six weeks ago.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the
administration understands Jordan's unique dependence on Iraq. The
administration is hopeful, she added, that with the help of
assistance from donor countries, Jordan soon will be in full
compliance with the U.S. goal of a ``total trade embargo'' against
Iraq.
   Ms. Tutwiler was far more critical of Jordan's decision to host
a three-day conference of Arab radicals and guerrillas. The
delegates warned that their objective is ``to strike against the
American interests everywhere and by all means at the same moment
an American military attack is launched against Iraq.''
   Ms. Tutwiler said the United States was ``surprised and dismayed
that this conference took place and we have told the Jordanians so.
We want to work with Jordan during and after this crisis in the
(Persian) Gulf. Hosting this conference is very hard for us to
understand.''
   King Hussein did not attend the conference but his reluctance to
take a strong stand against the Iraqi takeover of Kuwait has
strained what had been a close relationship with Washington dating
back many years.
   The 3,000 delegates attending the meeting also called for the
overthrow of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and said they will
initiate guerrilla actions against the United States and other
countries that have sent troops to Saudi Arabia.
   The sentiments expressed at the meeting, Ms. Tutwiler said,
``were not surprising, given the guest list,'' which included
representatives of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
   ``We are appalled by the statements that were made at that
conference. Such language is not only inflammatory but it can have
the result of inciting the kind of violence which it threatens,''
Ms. Tutwiler said.
   The rhetoric, she added, ignores the overriding threat to the
region, which is ``Iraq's unbridled ambition, evidenced by its
invasion and occupation of neighboring Kuwait.''

<HEAD>Manufacturer Says Seat Buckle Needs Replacement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The manufacturer of Evenflo child safety seats
said Tuesday it was recalling the buckle assembly on some models
because it does not meet government safety standards.
   Consumers can telephone or write for a free repair kit, the
company said in a statement.
   ``The problem with these seats is that at times the buckle can
look buckled and feel buckled even when it is not completely
latched,'' said Jerry Curry, administrator of the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration.
   ``This can give users a false sense of security that the child
is protected,'' Curry said. ``However, if the buckle is not
completely latched, it can release during a crash and substantially
reduce the protection provided to the child.''
   The recall involves more than 3 million child safety seats
manufactured between April 15, 1985, and April 22, 1990. Each seat
has a black buckle housing and a red push-button release.
   People who own the seats should not return them to the retailer,
Evenflo said. They should request a repair kit, which includes a
replacement buckle assembly that is easily installed.
   Consumers should continue using the seat until the replacement
arrives but should make certain the buckle is engaged by pulling
down firmly on the crotch strap, the company said.
   The recall involves infant-only car seats with the model numbers
441, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446, 448, 456, 458, 201 and 202;
convertible infant-toddler seats with model numbers 401, 402, 403,
404, 405, 406, 407, 408, 409, 411, 412, 414, 415, 416, 417, 453,
454, 221, 223, and 228; and booster seats with model numbers 470,
471, and 242.
   To obtain a repair kit, consumers should call 1-800-837-8926 or
write to Evenflo at 1801 Commerce Drive, Piqua, Ohio, 45356.

<TEXT>
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar on Tuesday warned that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait could lead
to the next world war unless a diplomatic settlement is found.
   ``I am old, but I have witnessed wars, global war. Global,
global, global war,'' said the 70-year-old U.N. chief.
   ``And that is the tremendous threat that we are facing now
because injustice was done against a small country, to one which
was one of the most faithful and loyal countries among our ranks,''
he said, referring to Kuwait, overrun Aug. 2 by its neighbor, Iraq.
   In making the remarks, the U.N. chief departed from the text of
a prepared speech to a luncheon of the U.N. Correspondents
Association.
   Perez de Cuellar's pessimistic comments follow his effort at
personal mediation in the Persian Gulf crisis. He traveled to
Jordan last month to meet with Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz,
but the meeting brought no breakthroughs and Perez de Cuellar
expressed disappointment afterward.
   Earlier Tuesday, the secretary-general warned that the Middle
East remains the ``most explosive region of the world today.''
   But in his annual report, Perez de Cuellar pointed with pride to
the U.N. Security Council's ``historic response'' to the Iraqi
invasion.
   In a series of resolutions, the council condemned the invasion,
rejected Iraq's claim to have annexed Kuwait, demanded the release
of all detained foreigners, imposed an economic embargo on Iraq and
occupied Kuwait, and allowed the use of naval force to back up the
embargo.
   The Security Council is now considering tightening the embargo
with a resolution calling for sanctions against any countries
violating it, and imposing an embargo on Iraq's air traffic.
   Perez de Cuellar said Middle East conflicts including the gulf
crisis could be resolved by adhering to some common principles.
   ``In the long run, lasting peace will come to the Middle East
only when the principles of international law govern the relations
between states, when the aspirations of those deprived of their
rights have been fulfilled, and regional security and economic
arrangements - which take into account the concerns of all the
parties in the area - have been established,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pastor, Church Members Accused of Trying To ``Beat the Devil'' Out

<TEXT>
   An Assembly of God pastor and two church
members accused of trying to ``beat the devil'' out of a south
Texas man have gone on trial on false imprisonment charges.
   The Rev. James Douglas Price, 42, pastor of First Assembly of
God Church, and brothers Robert Leo Nixon Jr., 42, and Alvin Ray
Nixon, 31, are accused of false imprisonment in the Jan. 29
incident.
   According to a Medina County grand jury indictment, the three
used force and intimidation to detain Evertt ``Ray'' Weimers, 43,
and slapped him and poured oil on him as part of a religious rite.
   Dr. Ricardo Castillo, who treated Wiemers for facial and
shoulder injuries, testified Monday that Weimers told him several
men tried to beat the devil out of him in an exorcism.
   The doctor said Weimers told him that before the beating he
spoke with Price, pastor of the church in Devine, 30 miles
southwest of San Antonio. He said he told Price he had been
despondent over marital and financial problems.
   ``The preacher told him the reason he was feeling that way was
that he had the devil in him and needed to be exorcised,'' the
doctor said. ``Then the preacher went to get some more parishioners
to beat it out of his system.''

   Tropical Storm Marie headed farther south of the
Hawaiian Islands than previously expected Tuesday, but forecasters
cautioned residents to prepare for effects of the storm.
   High surf kicked up by the storm hammered the eastern and
southern shores of Hawaii Island, prompting the closing of Punaluu
Beach Park. Surf there ranged from 8 to 10 feet, up from a normal
average of 1 to 2 feet, Hawaii County Civil Defense Administrator
Harry Kim said.
   The southeastern section of the island also experienced some
strong, gusty wind that blew debris onto some roads, Kim said.
   There were no reports of any property damage caused by the surf
or wind, he said.
   The storm was expected to pass about 250 miles south of the
South Point area of Hawaii Island.
   On Monday, the National Weather Service predicted the storm
would come within 130 miles of Hawaii Island, the Big Island, but
the storm began veering from a westerly course to the southwest.
   At 2 a.m., the storm was about 235 miles south southeast of
Hilo, on Hawaii Island's east coast, and was moving to the
southwest at 9 mph.
   The storm, downgraded from a hurricane Sunday, had a maximum
sustained wind speed of 65 mph with 85 mph gusts. Gale force wind
extended 125 miles out from the center.
   The storm's intensity was expected to change little until the
same time Wednesday, the weather service said.
   A tropical storm warning remained in effect for Hawaii Island
and a tropical storm watch was in effect for the islands of Maui,
Molokai and Lanai. No storm warnings were issued for Kauai and Oahu
islands; Honolulu is located on Oahu.
   A tropical storm warning means wind blowing at a sustained speed
of 39 mph to 73 mph is possible within 24 hours or less. A watch
means there is a threat of tropical storm conditions within 36
hours.

<HEAD>Budget Hangup Is Decade-Old Fight Over Tax Tilt to Rich or Poor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fight over President Bush's proposed
capital-gains tax cut, which is stalling critical deficit-reduction
talks, extends a decade-long battle pitting Democratic charges of a
tilt to the rich against a Republican focus on a need to spur
economic growth.
   ``It is absolutely incredible that the key item ... (in dispute)
is the president's insistence on giving a new gift to the higher
rollers in this society,'' Rep. David Obey, D-Wis, told reporters
Tuesday.
   However, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said the Democrats'
argument against cutting taxes on capital gains, which are profits
from the sale of investments, was simply wrong.
   ``Let's dispel any notion that the Republican capital-gains tax
(reduction) is to help the rich,'' he said. ``We're supposed to get
growth out of this budget.''
   As Democrats accused Bush and his party of risking a deficit
agreement to win on capital gains, the president sent his top
negotiators to the Capitol to discuss the next step in trying to
avoid massive, arbitrary cuts in most federal programs starting
Oct. 1.
   White House and congressional negotiators working on a plan to
cut the deficit by $50 billion next year hit an impasse Monday
night after reaching tentative agreement on several spending cuts
and tax increases.
   They met for an hour in the Capitol Tuesday, and agreed to
continue working toward a compromise.
   If the capital-gains issue could be settled, said Senate
Majority Leader George J, Mitchell, D-Maine, ``the rest would come
together quickly.''
   Domenici said, ``There are a number of hangups.''
   He noted Republicans have proposed to offset part of the
capital-gains reduction by limiting the state and local income tax
deductions available to people with incomes over $200,000. When the
two items are combined, he said, ``I don't see how that's helping
the rich.''
   Still, Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., declared that a
capital-gains cut ``is an ideological obsession of the right wing
of the Republican party and unfortunately the president has yielded
to it.''
   Economic growth has been Bush's argument for the reduction since
he proposed it during his 1988 campaign. Some economists agree that
reducing the tax would give people with money incentives for making
new investments that could create jobs. Others say there is no
evidence for such a claim.
   But the question of cutting the tax has been fought on another
point. Democratic leaders cite estimates that nearly 80 percent of
the benefit would go to those with incomes over $100,000 a year.
   Democrats note that higher-income people benefited greatly from
major tax laws enacted in 1981 and 1986. The 70 percent top tax
rate on their investment income was slashed to 28 percent as was
the 50 percent top rate on their wages.
   The latest GOP proposal would cut the maximum capital-gains rate
to 15 percent.
   A study by the labor-financed Citizens for Tax Justice provided
opponents this argument against a capital-gains reduction: The
492,000 richest 1 percent of families, with incomes averaging
$737,000, would reap a tax cut averaging nearly $20,000 a year. The
40 million families with incomes under $61,000 would see a tax cut
averaging $30.
   Bush and other backers of the reduction bristle at such
arguments. ``I am sick and tired of the demagogues who call this a
tax cut for the rich,'' Bush said earlier this year. ``It means
jobs, it means savings and it is good for all Americans.''
   Republicans note that millions of less-than-wealthy Americans
are likely to receive a capital gain at some time in their lives.
They say the statistics do not tell the whole story, since a
$50,000-a-year family that received a one-time $60,000 gain from
selling a family business would be listed in that year as among the
over-$100,000-a-year group.
   Capital gains enjoyed preferential tax treatment until the tax
code was thoroughly rewritten in 1986. As a price for cutting
individual income-tax rates across the board, Congress and
then-President Reagan agreed to take away or reduce numerous
special benefits, ranging from the deduction for state and local
sales taxes to the capital-gains preference.
   In its explanation of the new law, Congress concluded that the
lower overall rates eliminated the need for a special lower rate on
capital gains. In addition, the report stated, treating capital
gains like other income ``will result in a tremendous amount of
simplification for many taxpayers.''
   Restoring a special capital-gains rate, Democrats say, would
mean reneging on the 1986 bargain that special provisions should be
given up in favor of lower rates.

   Edwin Allan Lightner Jr., a 40-year U.S.
diplomat who saw the Berlin Wall erected and took part in a Cold
War prisoner exchange with the Soviet Union, has died at his home.
He was 82.
   Lightner died Saturday of congestive heart failure, said his
wife, Dorothy Lightner.
   The New York native joined the Foreign Service after graduating
from Princeton University in 1930. He served in 18 countries before
retiring in 1970. His last foreign post was ambassador to Libya
from 1963-65.
   Lightner served as charge d'affaires of the U.S. Embassy in
South Korea and was assistant chief of the U.S. Mission in Berlin
when the wall was erected in 1961.
   He was twice detained by East German border guards in October
1961 when he crossed into East Berlin to underscore the United
States' determination to have unrestricted access to all occupation
zones in Berlin.
   Lightner also participated in the Berlin exchange of Francis
Gary Powers, the American U-2 pilot shot down during a
reconnaissance flight over the Soviet Union in 1960.
   Lightner is survived by his wife, a brother, two sons and a
daughter.

   Methadone programs could be more effective in
helping stop the spread of AIDS if patients were given doses large
enough to wean them from their heroin habit, addiction treatment
experts told lawmakers Tuesday.
   Experts also testified that needle-exchange and outreach
programs are effective ways to reduce behavior that puts
intravenous drug users at high risk of becoming infected with the
AIDS virus.
   However, more than 80 percent of the estimated 1.5 million IV
drug users are not being reached with treatment programs, they
said.
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y. and chairman of the House Government
Operations subcommittee on human resources, estimated that more
than 2 million people - IV drug users and their sexual partners -
are at high risk of getting AIDS because they share needles and
have sex without protective condoms.
   These users and their partners ``have fallen through the
cracks,'' he said. ``Their addiction is not being treated and they
are not being protected from HIV infection.''
   According to a report by the congressional Office of Technology
Assessment released at the hearing, methadone programs differ
widely, including doses of the synthetic narcotic given to wean
heroin users from their addiction.
   An average daily dosage of 80 milligrams of methadone is
considered sufficient to wean most users from their heroin habit.
The lowest effective dose is believed to be around 60 milligrams,
the report said.
   However, a recent survey of 24 methadone programs found the
average daily dosages ranged from 21 to 67 milligrams, the report
said. Twenty-one of them gave an average daily dose of less than 60
milligrams.
   ``The reluctance to use higher dosages of methadone is rooted in
the belief that the narcotic-free state is optimal, and that
methadone is a medically-supervised narcotic addiction,'' said
Diana Hartel, an assistant professor at Albert Einstein College of
Medicine in New York.
   Most addicts on low-dose methadone treatment will relapse into
drug use repeatedly, putting them at high risk for AIDS again, she
said.
   The human immunodeficiency virus called HIV is spreading rapidly
among intravenous-drug users who often share the needles they use
to inject drugs. They, in turn, transmit the infection to their
sexual partners and the women transmit it to their babies.
   Methadone is not a treatment for cocaine and other non-opiate
drug abuse. Nor is it effective for all heroin users.
   But the OTA report concludes that ``even if treatment for drug
abuse is not 100 percent effective, it may markedly decrease drug
use for extended periods, and therefore decrease the probability of
HIV transmission.''
   ``It should be emphasized that when these interventions are
applied on a very large scale, to hundreds of thousands of people,
the public health impact of an intervention with even limited
effectiveness can be substantial.''
   The report also said the need to prevent the further spread of
AIDS ``increases the pressure for re-examination and scientific
evaluation of public policies with regard to the availability of
syringes and needles.''
   Holly Hagan, an epidemiologist at the Tacoma-Pierce County
Health Department, told the lawmakers that since the Tacoma, Wash.,
needle-exchange program began in August 1988, the number of drug
users in the area has not increased, as some critics feared.
   Also, the program has led IV drug users to cut down their use of
shared needles and to increase their use of bleach to sterilize
syringes, she said.

<HEAD>Europeans Decide To Support Air Embargo</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with European nations calling for air

   European nations, their anger at Saddam Hussein fueled by raids
on their diplomatic compounds in Kuwait, demanded Tuesday that the
U.N. trade embargo on Iraq be extended to the air as well as the
sea.
   The decision reflected the growing resolve among European
leaders to punish Baghdad. It came a day after the European
Community voted to expel Iraqi diplomats and restrict the movements
of others.
   At the United Nations, officials said the five permanent members
of the Security Council had worked out an agreement on terms of an
air embargo and were hoping to get it passed by the full 15
member-council before Monday.
   Under the embargo, officials said, planes on their way to Iraq
would not be forced down but could be challenged.
   The five permanent members are the United States, the Soviet
Union, China, Britain and France.
   In other developments Tuesday, U.S. government economic figures
for the month of August gave an idea of how the gulf crisis is
taking its toll at home: soaring energy prices.
   The flow of Kuwaiti refugees across the newly opened Saudi
border thinned abruptly as news spread that Iraqi troops were
seizing young husbands and sons from families as they tried to
leave.
   Refugees said the erratic manner in which the Iraqis were
treating them appeared part of a harsh campaign to break down their
will to resist.
   International pressure on Saddam Hussein was increasing, with
countries implementing diplomatic sanctions and alliances slowly
shifting in the Middle East.
   Syria and Iran announced that President Hafez Assad would visit
Tehran next week. Assad was expected to try to persuade his Iranian
allies to join the West and other Arab nations against Saddam.
Moscow and Washington have been trying to sway Iran from a possible
alliance with Iraq.
   Assad met last week with Secretary of State James A. Baker III
in the first major face-to-face contact between Damascus and
Washington since President Bush was elected in 1988.
   Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, emphasized that its renewal of ties
with Moscow, another former ally of Baghdad, should send a clear
sign to Saddam.
   ``When these two countries stand together for the withdrawal of
Iraqi troops from Kuwait ... and identify their position in a
common way, this, I believe, should give a message to Iraq that
their position is untenable,'' the Saudi foreign minister said.
   Saudi Arabia has been the staging ground for some 150,000 U.S.
troops that have been deployed since the Aug. 2 Iraqi takeover of
Kuwait.
   Jordan has tended to side with Iraq, its most important trading
partner, and on Tuesday it received some harsh criticism from the
State Department for acting as host to a radical Palestinian
guerrilla conference, where delegates have called for attacks on
U.S. forces.
   Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the United States is
``surprised and dismayed that this conference took place and we
have told the Jordanians so.''
   She also said the United States expects Jordan will end its
continuing purchases of Iraqi oil.
   One of Saddam's few key supporters, PLO chief Yasser Arafat,
arrived in Jordan Tuesday following talks with Saddam in Baghdad.
He met immediately with King Hussein in a continuing effort to come
up with a solution to the crisis, officials said. It was his third
visit to Jordan in less than four weeks.
   The first Japanese presence appeared in the gulf Tuesday - a
17-member Japanese medical team sent to Saudi Arabia.
   In Paris, defense and foreign ministers of nine European nations
- the Western European Union - decided to take steps as soon as
possible to enforce the U.N. embargo by air as well as by sea, a
statement said, and to coordinate air and ground forces.
   The union is the sole European body dealing with defense issues.
Its members include nine of the 12 European Community nations. Only
neutral Ireland, Greece and Denmark are not members.
   France and Britain, both of whom have now sent ground forces to
the gulf, want their allies in the union to join them - at least
symbolically. Italian and Dutch newspapers speculated Tuesday their
governments might sent ground troops. A number of nations have sent
ships and planes.
   On Monday, EC countries decided in Brussels to expel Iraqi
military attaches and restrict movements of Iraqi diplomats. On
Tuesday, Britain told the 41 Iraqi diplomats still in the country
they cannot go more than 25 miles from central London without
permission. Portugal restricted Iraqi diplomats to within 19 miles
of central Lisbon.
   The toll of the nearly 7-week-old crisis hit home Tuesday with
the release in Washington of economic figures for August. The
government said the Iraqi invasion sent gasoline prices up by 7.6
percent and fuel prices jumped 15.4 percent - the steepest rise in
those categories since January.
   The soaring energy prices pushed the cost of living up by 0.8
percent, the government said.
   Also, the gain in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index
was twice the 0.4 percent rise in July and the largest since
January. The department attributed nearly half that increase to the
gulf crisis.
   The trend will continue, economists predicted. They said crude
oil prices have continued to rise in September and will be felt at
the gas pump.
   At the border between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, hundreds of cars
were still lined up with fleeing Kuwaitis Tuesday, but their
numbers were greatly decreased as news spread the Iraqis were
seizing young men.
   Since Iraq unexpectedly opened the border Saturday, about 6,000
refugees have entered Saudi Arabia. Men under the age of 40 were
grabbed as cars were picked to leave the country in a haphazard
manner, the refugees said. Iraqi troops began seizing the men
Monday and sending the north in buses.
   Some Kuwaitis said the men would be forced into the military;
others said they would be interned in Iraq. The Iraqis gave no
explanation.
   A man who said he was 55 years old related how four men in their
20s were taken at gunpoint from his car as he approached the
frontier. He said he had not heard of the seizures the day before;
otherwise he would not have brought the young men.
   ``I didn't get the news,'' he repeated, staring at the ground.
He would not give his name.
   In Kuwait, the refugees said, police and military officers as
well as any Westerners still left were the targets of manhunts.
They said the new Iraqi-appointed governor of Kuwait, Ali Hussein
Abdel-Majid, had previously been in charge of eradicating Kurdish
resistance in northern Iraq.
   Iraq was widely condemned for using outlawed chemical weapons in
the crackdown on the rebellious Kurds in 1988.

<HEAD>Congresswoman Asks Labor Secretary To Intervene for Salvation Army</HEAD>

   Rep. Marge Roukema went to bat for the
Salvation Army Tuesday, askin the labor department to drop its
plan to require the charity to pay a minimum wage to its
client-workers.
   Roukema, R-N.J., asked Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole to grant
the organization an exemption from enforcement of minimum wage laws
at scores of centers around the country.
   ``The people served in the Salvation Army's work therapy
programs are not `employees,' they are participants in
rehabilitation,'' Roukema wrote in a letter to Dole.
   Acting on a complaint from a former Salvation Army client, the
U.S. Department of Labor on Sept. 7 ordered the organizationk,
based in Verona, N.J., to pay its workers a minimum wage.
   The department said other rehabilitation organizations,
including Goodwill Industries Inc., meet minimum wage standards
established under the Fair Labor Standards Act.
   Last Friday, the Salvation Army officials advised the department
that it would contest the order.
   The non-sectarian Christian group provides room, board and a
stipend to down-and-out clients who are expected to assist in the
organization's kitchens or unload discarded furniture and clothing
the Army collects.
   While the labor department views the clients as exploited
workers, Salvation Army attorney William J. Moss described them as
``beneficiaries'' who work at the centers for rehabilitation.
   Roukema repeated the Army's claim that payment of a wage could
doom its social service centers, which are kept financially afloat
by a network of thrift shops across the country.
   ``There are no winners in this scenario,'' she wrote. ``In the
end, the Salvation Army will suffer, the budgets of the cities and
states will suffer and, most importantly, those who will be denied
help will suffer.''

   The government said Tuesday it
will charge Winnie Mandela with kidnapping and assault, a move that
could endanger its peace talks with her husband's African National
Congress.
   Mrs. Mandela, wife of ANC leader Nelson Mandela, will be charged
in the alleged abduction and beatings of four young men at her home
in December 1988. One of them, 14-year-old Stompei Seipei, was
found dead.
   Mrs. Mandela's bodyguard, Jerry Richardson, was convicted of
murdering Seipei and sentenced to death last month. At his trial,
the surviving victims testified that Mrs. Mandela, 56, beat them
with a whip. She has denied wrongdoing.
   The announcement came as Mandela, the country's best-known black
leader, met with other ANC officials to discuss the police
crackdown on black factional fighting in townships around
Johannesburg.
   Mandela on Monday threatened to suspend the peace talks if the
government fails to halt the carnage that has killed nearly 800
blacks since Aug. 12. Most of the fighting has been between Xhosa
and other black ANC supporters and the Zulu-based conservative
Inkatha movement.
   He said new police measures announced Saturday, including
reinforcements, roadblocks, weapons searches and mounted machine
guns on police vehicles, would be ``ineffective'' and were a
``license to kill'' for security forces.
   Mandela has staunchly defended his wife and might be encouraged
by supporters to break off talks if the government proceeds with
the prosecution.
   President F.W. de Klerk and Mandela met twice last week and both
say they want black-white talks on ending apartheid to move forward
as quickly as possible. But the township battles, combined with the
charges against Mrs. Mandela, make setbacks appear more likely than
breakthroughs.
   Klaus von Lieres und Wilkau, attorney general for the
Johannesburg Supreme Court, had said he would await completion of
the Richardson case before deciding whether to charge Mrs. Mandela.
   ``After careful consideration of all the relevant facts,
including possible implications beyond the normal legal ones, I
have decided to prosecute Mrs. Mandela,'' he said in a statement.
   There was no immediate comment from Mrs. Mandela or her husband.
   They have accused the government of using the case as a
propaganda campaign against them and the ANC, the largest black
opposition group. They have said they would welcome a chance for
Mrs. Mandela to defend herself.
   She has denied any wrongdoing but has never given a full account
of the episode.
   An ANC statement refrained from criticizing the government and
urged the news media to let the courts decide the case.
   Mrs. Mandela will stand trial with seven members of her former
bodyguard unit whoalready have been charged, the attorney general
said. She will face four counts of kidnapping and four of assault
with intent to commit grievous bodily harm.
   She is expected to be formally charged Sept. 24, when the former
bodyguards are scheduled to appear in the regional court in Soweto,
outside Johannesburg.
   Her former bodyguards, about two dozen teen-agers known as the
Mandela United Football Club, were repeatedly in confrontations
with police, journalists and black groups in the township.
Anti-apartheid groups accused them of waging a reign of terror.
   According to court testimony, four black youths were kidnapped
in December 1988 from a church in Soweto and taken to Mrs.
Mandela's home in the township, where they were assaulted.
   Mrs. Mandela's bodyguards accused Seipei of being a police
informer and the three men of having homosexual relations with the
white minister who ran the church home, according to the testimony.
   The Methodist church cleared the minister of any misdeeds. There
was no evidence presented that Seipei, a well-known anti-apartheid
activist despite his young age, was a police spy.
   During her husband's 27 years in prison, Mrs. Mandela spent more
than a year in solitary confinement without being charged and was
under government restrictions, including house arrest, for more
than 20 years.
   The decision to prosecute Mrs. Mandela followed by a day the
government's arrest of right-wing extremist Piet Rudolph, who has
claimed responsibility for bombing two offices of de Klerk's
governing National Party. Rudolph also is suspected of a weapons
theft at an air force base.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said Rudolph's arrest showed
that police regarded ``crime as crime'' from either side of the
political spectrum.
   The independent South African Press Association reported that
Eugene TerreBlanche, leader of the extreme right-wing Afrikaner
Resistance Movement, said it was unfair Rudolph was arrested while
Mrs. Mandela remained free.

   Over the last two weeks Iraqi troop strength
in and near Kuwait has risen to 360,000 while some tanks and
artillery have been pulled back from the front lines near Saudi
Arabia, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   The Pentagon's last estimate two weeks ago was that there were
265,000 Iraqi troops and 2,200 tanks in Kuwait and in nearby
sections of Iraq.
   Spokesman Pete Williams said there are now 360,000 Iraqi troops
in those areas together with 2,80 tanks, 1,800 armored vehicles
and 1,450 artillery pieces. Although the number of tanks increased
overall, there are fewer near the Saudi Arabian border.
   In another development, Williams said that a team from the
guided missile cruiser USS Biddle stopped and boarded a Soviet
cargo ship, the Pyotyr Masherov, on Monday, as part of the effort
to block trade with Iraq.
   He described the boarding in the waters of the northern Red Sea
as ``routine'' and said it was conducted with the permission of the
master of the Soviet vessel.
   The Soviet ship was permitted to proceed and it entered the
Jordanian port of Aqaba, Williams said.
   He said it was the first boarding of a Soviet vessel in the
blockade but that there was no protest from the Soviet government.
   In discussing the Iraqi troop buildup, Williams said the overall
combat status of the forces remains about the same with the only
major difference being an increase in infantry.
   Williams said there is no indication Iraq has assumed a more
offensive military posture.
   ``The overall posture continues to be defensive,'' he said.
   But he said Iraq retains the ability to shift to go on the
offensive at short notice by launching an attack on oil-rich Saudi
Arabia.
   Williams noted that the total number of Iraqi soldiers increased
as infantry replaced armored units in regions close to the border
of Saudi Arabia.
   Since the United States began using naval vessels to enforce the
United Nations trade embargo against Iraq, there have been more
than 1,030 interceptions, Williams said. He noted that some vessels
likely were intercepted more than once.
   Seventy ships were boarded, he said, of which five were diverted
by U.S. and allied vessels.
   The five ships were of five separate nationalities, flying the
flags of Iraq, Cypress, the Bahamas, Sri Lanka and Liberia,
Williams said.

<TEXT>
   NASA engineers, baffled by
Columbia's persistent fuel leaks, pored over data Tuesday from the
shuttle's fourth failed launch attempt and pushed ahead for next
month's flight of Discovery.
   Columbia's commander Vance Brand said before leaving for Johnson
Space Center in Houston that he and his six-man crew were
disappointed the shuttle did not lift off early Tuesday as planned.
The next launch attempt for the astronomy mission will be no
earlier than November.
   ``Most of us have been involved in the space flight business for
some time, and we know from experience that hardware problems can
be difficult and it does not pay to fly until the spacecraft is
ready,'' Brand said.
   ``The astronomy mission is very worthwhile, and the crew is
ready and anxious to fly as soon as the remaining hydrogen leaks
are repaired.''
   NASA's fourth attempt to launch Columbia with a $150 million
astronomical observatory ended abruptly Monday evening, about seven
hours before planned liftoff. Despite repairs, hydrogen flooded the
engine compartment as the shuttle was being fueled.
   It was the third time since May that Columbia's countdown was
halted because of leaking hydrogen.
   ``We're really at a loss on this particular problem,'' said
David Winterhalter, director of systems engineering and analysis
for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   ``Engineers are a resourceful group. We're digging in, thinking
more about it, what is it we can do we haven't done.''
   NASA was forming an investigative team Tuesday to look into the
matter.
   Henry Pohl, director of engineering at Johnson Space Center,
said hydrogen appears to be escaping from a pin-size hole or
several tinier cracks inside Columbia's crowded engine compartment.
He said the leaks are difficult to trace because they appear only
when the liquid hydrogen is at its coldest - minus 423 degrees
Fahrenheit.
   Officials believe the leaks are linked to the dismantling of
Columbia after its last flight in January. Workers took apart the
engine compartment in a search for contamination by a
metal-polishing abrasive.
   ``I think we created a problem in that process,'' Pohl said.
``Someplace we didn't get a seal back on right or something.''
   Insulation probably will have to be removed in the engine
compartment, a time-consuming job, Pohl said. Workers are not
expected to gain access to the area until Wednesday.
   Pohl said he's not worried Discovery might have hydrogen leaks
similar to those plaguing Columbia and Atlantis.
   Discovery is scheduled to lift off around Oct. 8 with a
plutonium-powered satellite that will explore the sun's poles.
   If Discovery does not lift off with the Ulysses satellite by
Oct. 23, the $750 million mission will have to wait until late 1991
when Earth, the sun and Jupiter are back in the proper alignment.
   NASA has not decided whether to conduct a tanking test on
Discovery before launch because it takes about five days.
   Discovery experienced no problems during its flight in April
with the Hubble Space Telescope, which later was found to have a
flawed mirror. That was the last time a shuttle has flown.
   John Pike, director of the Federation of American Scientists'
space policy project, said the fact NASA has launched shuttles 35
times proves ``they can make it work in general.''
   ``The problem is making it work in particular right now,'' Pike
said. ``The bottom line is it's more bad news when they really
could use some good news.''

   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat on Tuesday
briefed Jordan's King Hussein on talks he had held a day earlier
with Iraq's President Saddam Hussein, a senior PLO official said.
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said the two
discussed developments in the Persian Gulf crisis set off by Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. It was the third meeting in a month
between the Jordanian monarch and Arafat, chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Meanwhile, George Habash, the leader of the Marxist Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and Nayef Hawatmeh, leader
of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, received
thunderous applause when they made public appearances in Jordan for
the first time in two decades.
   The two, along with Arafat, were banned from Jordan after the
1970 ``Black September'' battles against King Hussein's army.
   Arafat patched up his differences with the king and made his
first return trip to Jordan in 1984. The other two only recently
gained a royal pardon.
   Habash told reporters he had the impression that Jordan and the
PLO ``share the same political ground'' - support for an Arab
settlement of the gulf crisis. Jordan has a large Palestinian
population.
   ``We are facing a common danger,'' he told reporters.
   Habash declared that the solution to the gulf crisis must be
linked to an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Saddam also has demanded that the discussions on Kuwait be
linked to resolving the Palestinian problem.
   The United States and its allies have rejected that position.
   After his flight from Jordan, Habash established the PFLP
headquarters in the Syrian capital, Damascus. This led to a cooling
of his group's relations with Iraq because of the long feud between
President Hafez Assad of Syria and Saddam.
   Palestinian rejection of the U.S. military presence and the new
cooperation between Washington and some Arab states, including
Syria, appears to be altering alignments.
   Habash denied that he had been banned from returning to
Damascus.
   He said the PFLP will open an office in Baghdad, but denied that
it would be the group's new headquarters.
   He said there were no plans to open an Amman office despite the
rapprochement with King Hussein. Palestinian sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Jordanian security was wary of
allowing PFLP radicals to freely travel in Jordan.

   Two young men announced Tuesday at the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial that they will refuse to serve in the Army
because they oppose the U.S. military buildup in Saudi Arabia.
   Matthew Brown, 20, enlisted in June in Albany, Calif., to become
an Army medical corpsman, but said he will refuse to report on Oct.
4 for his basic training.
   ``I'm not going to show up,'' Brown told reporters. ``I don't
support what's going on. I feel the military buildup is
ill-advised.'' He said he was asking the Army to let him out of the
commitment, but not filing for conscientious objector status.
   Patrick Colclough, 21, of Saugerties, N.Y., had been a Reserve
Officer Training Corps cadet at St. Lawrence University in Canton,
N.Y., but decided last year to stop participating in training.
   ``I've been soul-searching, you might say,'' Colclough said.
``The recent events really crystallized my opposition to war.''
   Colclough said he faces a hearing Sept. 26 on his refusal to
fulfill his ROTC contract, which could result in an order to active
duty. He said he would ask for conscientious objector status at the
hearing, and refuse to report if ordered to active duty.
   The news conference was organized by Citizen Soldier, a New
York-based advocacy organization for soldiers and veterans. Tricia
Critchfield, its associate director, said the group was aware of
about a dozen soldiers nationwide who are actively refusing service
because of opposition to U.S. involvement in the mideast crisis.
   President Bush has ordered more than 100,000 troops to Saudi
Arabia in response to Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   After speaking to reporters in a field near the memorial, Brown
and Colclough posed for photographers in front of the black wall
listing the names of American soldiers killed or missing in
Vietnam.
   ``These are thousands of lives that could have gone on to be
part of America,'' Brown said. ``There are so many names it sort of
numbs you.''

<HEAD>Researchers Find Immune System Abnormality Linked to Miscarriages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COLLEEN DISKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women with an abnormal immune condition related
to the thyroid may be twice as likely to suffer miscarriages early
in pregnancy, a study has found.
   But an independent researcher and authors of the report
published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association cautioned that the finding needs further study.
   ``This is the first time anything like this has been found,''
said one of the study's authors, Dr. Alex Stagnaro-Green of the
endocrinology division of Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New
York. ``Before women need to start worrying about this, this study
will have to be replicated.''
   The report is the first to link miscarriages with the presence
of two thyroid auto-antibodies - thyroglobulin and
thyroidperoxidase. An auto-antibody is a type of antibody, but
instead of aiding the body in fighting off disease, it works
against it, Stagnaro-Green said.
   It's unclear what causes the two thyroid auto-antibodies, but
researchers know they are related to a disfunction in the way the
immune system typically works, he said.
   Stagnaro-Green said the study, ``is an important finding in that
it's another instance in which immunological factors have been
linked to miscarriages.''
   Women who test positive for either thyroglobulin and
thyroidperoxidase don't suffer from common hormonal disorders such
as an overactive or underactive thyroid, Stagnaro-Green said.
   ``It really has nothing to do with the hormonal balance,'' he
said. ``The only way to tell whether these auto-antibodies are
present is through a blood test.''
   In the study, researchers at Mount Sinai screened 552 women from
seven obstetric practices in New York during their first trimester
and found that 108, or 19.6 percent, tested positive for thyroid
auto-antibodies. The rest tested negative.
   Researchers then collected information on whether the women
carried the pregnancy to full term. Of the 492 women available for
follow-up, 10.2 percent suffered a miscarriage.
   The report said that 8.4 percent who tested negative for the
auto-antibodies miscarried. Seventeen percent, or twice the rate,
miscarried among women who had tested positive for the
auto-antibodies, the report said.
   Stagnaro-Green said further studies would have to verify his
results, and to determine a cause-and-effect.
   A doctor not associated with the study agreed.
   ``The results of this study are certainly interesting, but also
need to be looked at with caution,'' said Dr. Elliot Main, an
assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology who runs a
reproductive immunology lab at the University of California, San
Francisco.
   Main said the incidence of women who tested positive for the
auto-antibodies - nearly 20 percent - was high.
   ``One should always be suspicious when that large a share of a
group that is otherwise normal reflects an abnormality,'' he said.
``They could suggest some false positives.
   Main also said a study needs to address the question of whether
the process of miscarrying somehow leads to the development of
auto-antibodies, rather than the other way around.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney consulted with
the White House on Tuesday about his selection of a Vietnam veteran
and former Thunderbird pilot to replace the general he fired as Air
Force chief of staff.
   Cheney's spokesman, Pete Williams, said the secretary had
discussed with White House officials his selection of Gen. Merrill
A. McPeak to replace Gen. Mike Dugan, fired Monday after revealing
to reporters secret U.S. plans that contemplate bombing Iraq and
personally targeting Prsident Saddam Hussein.
   Williams declined to say how soon President Bush is expected to
act on Cheney's recommendation.
   White House sources said, however, that the Pentagon had not yet
sent over the paperwork to set in motion the presidential review
process. The sources, who requested anonymity, said that after the
paper arrives, it will take some time for officials there to review
the matter before Bush decides whether to nominate McPeak.
   At the Pentagon, meanwhile, Cheney sought to reassure his
subordinates that they have nothing to fear from talking to
reporters.
   ``It would be a thorough misreading and a total misunderstanding
if anyone were to conclude that we're trying to discourage people
from talking to the press,'' Williams said.
   The spokesman said he had said as much to commanders and other
Pentagon officials.
   ``We encourage our military commanders to be open and
accessible,'' he said.
   In contrast to his predecessors, Dugan had encouraged more
openness with the press - to a point that got him in trouble after
he told three reporters aboard a plane to Saudi Arabia late last
week that the United States has contingency plans to bomb Baghdad
and target Saddam.
   Explaining his decision to dump Dugan, Cheney said Monday that
the chief of staff had displayed a ``lack of judgment'' by engaging
publicly in ``wide-ranging speculation'' about U.S. military
options in Iraq.
   Dugan will receive a full pension, which for an officer with his
rank and seniority totals about $60,000 annually, officials said.
   McPeak, 54, is commander in chief of the Pacific Air Forces at
Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii. His responsibility includes U.S.
air operations from Japan to the United States, and a command of
more than 60,000 people.
   In his 33 years of service, McPeak has flown over 4,000 hours on
fighter planes and became a skilled parachutist.
   For two years starting in 1966 he flew solo or the lead position
in nearly 200 air shows as a member of the Thunderbirds - the U.S.
Air Force Air Demonstration Squadron.
   The stunt flying was good preparation for his next mission:
Vietnam.
   McPeak flew 269 combat sorties in the year he served there,
earning several decorations.
   He then attended the National War College and got a master's
degree at the same time.
   McPeak was assigned to command U.S. air bases in England and
Spain, and was promoted to chief of staff of U.S. air forces in
Europe.
   He subsequently held several command positions at home, assuming
his current job in July 1988. He was made a full general at the
same time.
   A health and fitness buff, McPeak is married and has two sons.

<HEAD>Ozone Hole Detected Early This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Antarctic ozone hole has been detected a
month earlier this year than in the past, due to improved methods
of measuring the chemical, federal officials said Tuesday.
   Instruments aboard a polar orbiting satellite detected the
beginning of an ozone hole on Aug. 22, and the region of depleted
ozone has enlarged since then, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration announced.
   The thin layer of ozone high in the earth's atmosphere protects
the planet from dangerous ultraviolet radiation from the sun.
   Manmade chemicals can damage that layer, however, and if it were
thinned over populated regions scientists fear an increase of skin
cancer and other damage to humans, animals and plants.
   The so-called hole, actually a region of depleted ozone, has
been detected over Antarctica during several recent winters there.
The seasons are reversed south of the Equator.
   In the past, however, instruments have been able to measure
ozone only using visible light. Because Antarctica has nearly six
months of darkness in its winter, detection of the ozone hole has
been possible only after mid-September in past years.
   Now, NOAA reported, satellite-borne instruments have been used
to measure ozone using infrared radiation, allowing the ozone hole
to be detected during the darkness.
   The ozone hole is generally worst in October, which is
springtime in that region. During that period a band of winds
called the polar vortex encircles the region, preventing air there
from mixing with the atmosphere in other parts of the world.
   During the period temperatures drop to -125 degrees Fahrenheit
in the upper atmosphere, creating a situation where
chlorofluorocarbons can react with the ozone and deplete it. Later
in the year temperatures warm somewhat, the vortex breaks down and
outside air mixes in restoring normal ozone levels.
   NOAA officials said that they have collected infrared
measurements from the region for several years but only now have
figured out how to use this data to calculate the ozone loss during
the Antarctic darkness.
   That past data remains in storage and scientists hope that they
can now use it to calculate dates and strength of the ozone hole
for past years.

<HEAD>Computer Ignorance May Have Cost Taxpayers Millions, Congress Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Computer ignorance at the Agriculture
Department cost the public nearly $62 million when $7 million might
have been sufficient to cover the job, according to testimony
Tuesday before Congress.
   At issue is a project started in 1983 when the Agriculture
Stabilization and Conservation Service contracted with the Arthur
Andersen accounting firm to design two nationwide computer systems
to monitor commodities inventories.
   The firm wouldn't take the job unless the $7 million contract
included a ``cost plus'' clause, or one that provides an open-ended
contract in case unforeseen expenses arise. The firm said it needed
that guarantee because of the vagueness of the service's request.
   ``Most agencies by now have learned that cost plus is a ticket
for automatic disaster,'' said Rep. Robert Wise, D-W.Va., whose
House Government Operations subcommittee on agriculture is
investigating the contract.
   Basically, Andersen's job was to design a system for users who
didn't know exactly what they wanted, said JayEtta Hecker a
director at the General Accounting Office which conducted a review
of the computer system for Wise.
   She said Andersen was not always required to correct defects at
its own expense, but did nothing illegal under the contract.
   It was ``ineffective management and oversight'' along with
poorly defined needs and inconsistent direction at the top levels
of the agriculture service that caused costs to escalate, she said.
   ``In the last seven years, six people have served as the deputy
administrator for management,'' Hecker said. ``This lack of
continuity has contributed to decisions to start, stop and restart
the project which has resulted in additional costs.''
   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., pointed out that administrator's
job at the stabilization and conservation service has been filled
by political appointees whose credentials have not always included
computer expertise.
   ``Basically, we've had political hacks holding the job,'' he
said.
   ``They didn't know enough about what they wanted and where they
were going, did they?'' he asked Hecker. ``They were sheep to be
shorn.''
   ``That's a pretty good characterization,'' she said.
   Dr. Sarita Schotta, a computer expert who has been deputy
administrator of the service for the last year, tried to assure the
congressional subcommittee that she was providing the kind of
supervision the project should have had all along.
   She said the computer system should be complete by next year.
She emphasized that the technological advances involved 3,000 field
offices.
   Part of the oversight problem came because the agency was ``so
overwhelmed with getting software out in 300 counties,'' she said.
``The folks they were training already had 20 to 30 years in county
office. The last they thought they'd be doing was using
computers.''
   The stabilization and conservation service is in charge of
administering farm commodity, conservation and emergency assistance
programs, including commodity loans and price support payments to
farmers. It handles billions of dollars each year.
   In 1989, for example, its program and administrative costs
amounted to $13 billion. By the end of the fiscal year, its
commodities inventories totaled nearly $4 billion.
   Its automated system for tracking acquisition, storage,
movement, sale and donation of grain and processed commodities had
not been updated since the 1950s.

   Honolulu Mayor Frank Fasi is objecting to a
campaign ad that shows him shaking hands with Republican
gubernatorial candidate Leonard Mednick. Fasi says he voted for
someone else.
   Hawaii's primary election is scheduled for Saturday but Fasi
said he already has voted by absentee ballot for someone other than
Mednick.
   There are six Republicans running in the primary, with state
Rep. Fred Hemmings favored to win.
   Fasi said he also has a problem with a subtitle running on
Mednick's ad, which states, ``Leonard Mednick, the Fasi-Republican
for Governor.''
   Gov. John Waihee, who is seeking election to a second four-year
term, is favored over three challengers in the Democratic primary.

<HEAD>Democrat Criticizes GOP's $300,000 Pledge to Taft Criticized</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pledge of $300,000 from the Ohio GOP
that helped persuade Robert Taft II to run for secretary of state
rather than governor was a payoff, a spokesman for Democratic
incumbent Sherrod Brown said Tuesday.
   ``Bob Taft became a candidate for secretary of state not because
he thought the job was right, but because the price was right,''
said Dale Butland, a spokesman for the Brown campaign.
   Butland said a Dayton Daily News story about the state GOP's
campaign pledge shows that Taft was pressured out of the governor's
race by promises of campaign money.
   The newspaper reported Tuesday that Taft abandoned his bid for
governor 12 days after being offered the check by Ohio Republican
Party Chairman Robert Bennett. The check was voided after a Feb. 2
meeting between Bennett and Taft, which ended with Taft publicly
maintaining he would remain in the governor's race.
   But about four months after Taft changed his mind, he received
$300,000 in contributions from the Ohio Republican Party and the
Republican National Committee.
   Brian Berry, executive director of the state party, acknowledged
that Bennett had offered the check.
   ``It's no big surprise to anybody that the state party was ready
to commit dollars. No big surprise. This is a phony issue,'' Berry
said.
   Bennett told the Daily News the $300,000 check had been a prop
for his meeting with Taft, designed to demonstrate the GOP's
commitment to winning the Secretary of State's office. The meeting
was aimed at avoiding a costly, divisive primary with ultimate GOP
gubernatorial nominee George Voinovich.
   Taft told the Daily News the party's commitment of money helped
persuade him to leave the governor's race.
   ``Certainly one factor in my decision was knowing what kind of
support there would be from the state and national party,'' he was
quoted as saying.

<HEAD>Andrus Promises Tax Relief To Property Owners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic Gov. Cecil Andrus on Tuesday
pledged to use the Idaho's budget surplus to slash local property
taxes if he is re-elected to a fourth term in November.
   Andrus said state budget analysts already were drafting the
tax-cut plan.
   ``I believe we will have adequate revenue to target that tax
relief to substantial reductions in local property taxes,'' the
governor said in a statement.
   His underdog opponent, former Republican state Sen. Roger
Fairchild, said this summer that he would use the state surplus to
underwrite a revenue sharing program for local governments that
would include property tax relief.
   Based on revenue estimates from administration economists, the
state will have a onetime windfall of around $45 million.
   ``The property tax is for most Idahoans the most onerous tax,''
the governor said. ``It is time to return some of the budget
surplus we have enjoyed to our citizens.''

<HEAD>Democrats Accuse Gingrich Group Of Violating Election Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional Democrats filed a complaint
Tuesday accusing a group headed by House Minority Whip Newt
Gingrich of violating federal election law.
   The complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission by
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. It said the
Gingrich group, GOPAC, has been working to influence federal
elections but has not registered with the FEC, as required by law.
   The complaint was based on a recent direct mail campaign in
which GOPAC solicited contributions and urged people to sign a
``citizens veto'' to protest the congressional franking privilege.
   Letters used in the direct mail campaign stated that GOPAC hopes
to raise $180,000 to campaign for a Republican majority in Congress
in 1992 by fighting the franking privilege and the practice of
gerrymandering in congressional redistricting.
   Under federal election law, any group that raises or spends more
than $1,000 to influence federal elections must register as a
political committee with the FEC.
   Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, is general chairman of GOPAC. He
said the DCCC complaint ``is as phony and as inaccurate as
everything else the DCCC has said about me in the last two years.''

<HEAD>45th General Assembly Opens, New President Elected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 45th U.N. General Assembly, the first
of the post-Cold War era, convened Tuesday for a three-month
session. The Persian Gulf crisis was expected to dominate the
agenda.
   The 159 nations welcomed their newest colleague in the
international forum, Liechtenstein, which became the 160th member.
When East and West Germany unite in October and occupy a single
seat, the membership again will fall to 159.
   Guido de Marco, the foreign minister of Malta, was chosen by
acclaim president of the General Assembly, a largely ceremonial
post, but one with influence on the agenda of more than 155 items.
   The presidency rotates yearly among regional groupings.
   De Marco, in his inaugural speech, called the forthcoming
unification of Germany a sign of new optimism.
   He called it ``a symbol of the new healing role of Europe with
its dismantling of barriers, the freeing of peoples, the
reinstating of democratic institutions and the progressive
abandonment of armaments.''
   But the president said Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait was a
sign of the dangers ahead. He called Iraq's attack on its neighbor
not only ``an outrageous and illegal action in itself, but an
action which also reflects the bitterness and turmoil, the hatred
and injustice that prevail in the Middle East.''
   De Marco told the assembly: ``The world is indeed at a turning
point in history. The question is, ``In which direction are we
turning?''
   The Security Council, he said, has responded clearly and
unequivocally in demanding the immediate withdrawal of Iraqi forces
and restoration of the government of Kuwait.
   ``We cannot shirk our responsibities,'' he said, adding that
people around the world were looking to the assembly for moral and
political guidance.
   The General Assembly cannot adopt legally binding resolutions,
but its statements carry weight as representing the will of the
international community.
   In addition to the Persian Gulf crisis, he said, the
international community faces continuing unsolved conflicts, such
as the status of Palestinians, many living in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``The Palestinian question has a dimension which goes far beyond
the occupied territories,'' he said. ``It creates rancor,
soul-searching, prejudices and, unfortunately, hatred.''
   He said convening an international conference on the Middle East
was a fundamental step to peace in the region. The current U.N.
session, he said, must try to reach a comprehensive settlement of
the Palestinian question.
   ``Delay in solving the Palestinian issue is a denial to the
Palestinian people of the country which is theirs, and to Israel of
those secure and guaranteed frontiers to which it is entitled.''
   He also cited debt and development, poverty, terrorism,
narcotics, the environment and the role of women as major issues
confronting the forthcoming General Assembly.

<HEAD>Antarctic Explorer Urges Protection For Continent</HEAD>

   Polar explorer Will Steger entertained members
of Congress Tuesday with tales of his dog-sled trek across
Antarctica. But his support for legislation to make the frozen
continent a ``world park'' met with a cold response.
   Steger, of Ely, Minn., was the star witness when the House
Interior subcommittee opened hearings on legislation sponsored by
Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., that would ban U.S. mineral exploration
and curtail other development damaging Antarctica's environment.
   ``Internationally we've been dragging our feet when it comes to
the Antarctic issue,'' Steger told the panel. ``There's an
opportunity to take a leadership role for the environment.''
   Steger co-led a six-member international trans-Antarctica
expedition which completed the longest unmechanized passage across
the continent in March.
   He described the team's battle with a 2-month-long storm, when
winds hit 35 to 50 mph, and their fears that they wouldn't find a
companion who became lost overnight shortly before the end of the
3,741-mile trek.
   ``It's almost like crossing another planet,'' Steger said.
   The United States should take the lead to ensure the continent
stays as pristine as it is now, even though it may contain valuable
deposits of uranium and platinum, he said.
   ``In order to preserve this place it may be best that we leave
it,'' said Rep. Jim Oberstar, D-Minn.
   But officials with the departments of State and Interior said
other nations with interests in Antarctica must cooperate before
the United States could agree to banning mining and turning
Antarctica into a nature reserve.
   ``However unlikely it may seem now, it is possible to envision
circumstances where shortages of critical mineral resources may
force other nations to ignore a ban,'' said William Houston, a
deputy assistant secretary of Interior.
   ``Negotiating an effective agreement to protect the Antarctic
environment under these circumstances would be very difficult.''
   The existing Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral
Resource Activities prohibits mineral exploration on the continent
unless there is a consensus that it would not hurt the environment,
Houston said.
   Vento argued that CRAMRA, signed in 1988, ``was a step in the
wrong direction'' in that it provided the basis for future mining.
The United States instead should take the initiative in prohibiting
Antarctic mineral development, he said.
   Peter Wilkins, director of polar programs for the National
Science Foundation, said the Antarctic legislation could disrupt
scientific research in the region at a time when NSF is remedying
past environmental problems.
   The legislation would apply all U.S. environmental and historic
preservation laws to the continent without regard to its unique
situation, he said.
   For example, U.S. law could require chemical processing of waste
water and cause more damage than current treatment methods
recommended by scientists, Wilkins said.

   Poland's feuding leaders, led by
Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa and Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, agreed on the need for early, free elections but little
else in meetings Tuesday, participants said.
   The six hours of discussions, called by the powerful Roman
Catholic primate, brought together more prominent officials than
any meeting since the spring 1989 negotiations that led to the
downfall of the Communist regime.
   Participants had cautioned before starting that no decisions
would be made behind closed doors, and indicated afterward they
were divided on key issues concerning the nation's next steps
toward democracy.
   They said the session served as preparation for Thursday's
potentially fiery debate in Parliament on the schedule for
post-Communist Poland's first fully democratic presidential and
parliamentary elections.
   ``There couldn't have been any decisions because it was just a
conversation,'' said Walesa - the only declared presidential
candidate - as he left Primate Jozef Glemp's residence.
   Mazowiecki said there had been a ``broad exchange ... about all
the problems Poland faces.'' But asked if there was a convergence
of views, he said: ``I don't think so.''
   Minister Aleksander Hall, responsible for contacts among
political parties, said two concepts emerged: one to hold a
presidential election first and the other to hold balloting for the
presidency and parliament at the same time.
   ``All are of the opinion that those events should take place in
the next few months,'' he said.
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski, the former Communist Party leader
who has indicated he will leave office early, said the
``constructive'' exchange ``brings us closer to decisions.''
   ``The primate's intention is to create the most civilized
conditions for further political evolution in Poland,'' deputy
government spokesman Edward Krzemien told Polish radio. ``The point
is that the coming elections shouldn't divide and tear Poland apart
but provide transition to democracy.''
   The once-united Solidarity movement has split into two camps.
One, Center Alliance, backs Walesa and is identified with workers
and the Solidarity union headquartered in Gdansk. The other, known
by the acronym ROAD, includes many intellectuals and supports
Mazowiecki and the government in Warsaw.
   Leaders of both groups, evolving as political parties after four
decades of one-party Communist leadership, were among the 25 people
invited. Also included were other Parliamentary leaders.
   The session followed Walesa's announcement Monday that he will
run for president in the elections expected as early as this fall
and no later than spring.
   There has been no word on a bid by Mazowiecki. Walesa parted
ways with his former adviser over the pace of reforms, saying the
government has lost sight of the issues and that too many
Communists remain in positions of power.
   A public opinion poll conducted Sept. 3-4 and published Tuesday
showed Mazowiecki was supported for president by 48 percent of
those surveyed, compared with 37 percent for Walesa. The rest had
no opinion.
   However, Walesa's prominence, political instincts and authority
are incalculable and he has said he is confident of victory. He
received the loudest cheers from the crowd watching the arrivals at
the primate's residence. Jaruzelski was greeted by derisive
whistles.
   The poll also showed a drop in confidence in the government from
82 percent in January to 61 percent. About half of those questioned
had never heard of either the Center Alliance or ROAD.
   The church's position in the election will be critical in
overwhelmingly Catholic Poland.
   The Polish media first dubbed the session a ``small
round-table,'' reminiscent of the unprecedented spring 1989
meetings of the former Communist authorities and the Solidarity-led
opposition. The talks opened the way for reform in Poland and
across Eastern Europe.
   But Walesa and others objected and the session became known as
``tea at the primate's.''
   ``Free elections will become our new round-table, not any
agreement behind the back of society,'' Walesa said.
   Jaruzelski, the former Communist Party leader who jailed Walesa
and Mazowiecki during martial law, imposed in 1981, has said he is
willing to resign early from his six-year term.

<HEAD>27 Become Citizens in Constitution Week Celebration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Standing before the glass-enclosed original of
the U.S. Constitution, 27 foreigners took the oath as American
citizens this week to begin the annual ``Constitution Week''
celebration of the signing of the nation's charter 203 years ago.
   The former citizens of 27 countries, from Peru and the
Philippines to Ireland and Africa's Ivory Coast, were sworn in
Monday by U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene in the rotunda of
the National Archives, where the original Constitution, the
Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights are on display.
   ``The blending of peoples and ideas has brought vitality to our
history and remains America's continued source of strength,'' said
Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., who welcomed the new citizens to
their adopted homeland.
   ``The decision to change one's citizenship must surely be
accompanied by a bittersweet mix of cherished memories of the past
and spirited hopes for the future,'' she said. ``Many Americans
have a close relative who can recall these feelings.''
   Thousands of communities across the country were encouraged to
observe Constitution Week with parades, speeches, public readings
of the Constitution, worship services, school assemblies and
historical pageants.
   Some communities held bell-ringing ceremonies at 4 p.m. EDT
Monday, the hour when the Constitution was signed in Philadelphia
on Sept. 17, 1787.
   Constitution Week, an annual event established by Congress in
1956, is being coordinated this year by the Commission on the
Bicentennial of the United States Constitution, which is sponsoring
a five-year celebration of the beginnings of the U.S. government.
   ``Constitution Week is an observance not only of our freedoms,
but of our responsibilities as citizens as well,'' said former
Chief Justice Warren Burger, the commission chairman.
   ``Constitution Week enables us to involve millions of Americans
in recognizing the significance of the Constitution in our lives
and as a symbol of freedom to the world,'' Burger said in a message
to Americans.
   The commission began in 1987 with a commemoration of the signing
of the Constitution and will end next year with a celebration of
the 200th anniversary of the adoption of the Bill of Rights.
   This year, the commission is focusing public attention on the
convening of the Supreme Court in 1790 and the formation of the
federal judiciary. Burger will address a national conference of
bicentennial officials in Washington on Friday.

<HEAD>OSHA Seeks $1.2 Million Fine From Texas Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal safety officials proposed a $1.2
million fine Tuesday against a Texas metal company accused of
failing to report workplace injuries such as amputations, cuts,
fractures and eye injuries.
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited Kaspar
Wire Works, Inc., of Shiner, Texas, for knowingly and repeatedly
violating federal laws governing the record keeping and reporting
of workplace injuries and illnesses.
   Kaspar spokesman Dan Price said company officials would not
comment until they could review the allegations.
   The company was cited for 385 instances of alleged ``willful''
failure to record or accurately record injuries and illnesses in
1988 and 1989, OSHA said.
   Other alleged violations included failure to provide medical
records in a timely fashion and not reporting injuries to
employees.
   In addition, there were several serious'' violations of OSHA
standards governing handrails on stairs, air compressor alarms,
containers for hazardous liquids, electrical grounding and labeling
containers of hazardous chemicals.
   Willful violations are those committed with an intentional
disregard of, or plain indifference to, federal job safety laws.
   A serious violation is one in which there is a substantial
probability that death or serious physical harm could result, and
the employer knew or should have known of the hazard.
   Kaspar, located about 90 miles south of Austin, employs about
850 workers. It makes newspaper vending machines and other metal
products, including wire baskets and barbecue grills.
   Kaspar has 15 working days to contest the allegations before an
independent review commission.

   A fire aboard a gasoline tanker was
declared under control a second time Tuesday and firefighters
boarded the vessel to pump fire-retardant foam inside as a
precaution.
   The fire erupted with a series of explosions Sunday aboard the
M.V. Jupiter moored in the Saginaw River. One crewman is missing
and believed dead.
   Private specialist firefighters working from a Coast Guard
vessel at first declared victory over the blaze Monday afternoon,
but it re-ignited that evening, burning all night and into Tuesday.
   On Tuesday, firefighters from the Texas firm Boots &amp; Coots
returned and knocked the flames down with fire-retardant foam. They
believed the fire was put out Tuesday afternoon, said Tom Dalesio,
a spokesman for Ashland Oil Inc. of Ashland, Ky., parent of the
company that owns the Jupiter.
   After the flames appeared out, a crew boarded the mangled tanker
to spray more foam inside the ship and begin inspecting it, Dalesio
said.
   Damage estimates weren't expected before Wednesday, when experts
would begin planning how to salvage the ship, he said.
   The tanker had unloaded just over half its cargo of 2.3 million
gallons of gasoline when the fire broke out Sunday and raged for 30
hours, and officials are unsure how much, if any, gas may have
leaked into the river.
   The tanker's bow was lodged on the river floor in a shallow spot
but its stern remained afloat.
   The blaze erupted after a transfer hose snapped, spewing
gasoline.
   Ashland blamed the accident on a passing vessel, saying its wake
rocked the Jupiter, parting mooring lines and the hose.
   Ashland attorneys have written American Steamship Co., owner of
the coal freighter Buffalo, to say ``we hold them responsible,''
said Roger Schrum, an Ashland spokesman.
   American Steamship spokeswoman Kelly Pezone denied the
allegation.
   Some fuel splashed into the water Tuesday, prompting crews to
pile absorbent booms around the tanker, said state Department of
Natural Resources spokesman Terry Walkington.
   The Coast Guard is investigating the accident.
   No one is sure is how much gasoline remains on the ship or
spilled, said Ashland spokesman Dan Lacy.
   DNR and state health experts were awaiting results of water- and
air-pollution tests.
   At the height of the blaze, black smoke spread for 100 miles and
hundreds of dead fish were found near the tanker. The test results
were expected later in the week.
   Some residents were angry that evacuations hadn't been ordered.
   ``We have human health at risk here,'' said Terry Miller,
chairman of the Lone Tree Council, an area environmental group. ``I
would think just as a precautionary measure, they should have asked
local residents to evacuate even if it's just gasoline burning.''
   Tim Bosco, 29, owner of Bosco's fruit market located a half mile
from the burning tanker, said the fumes gave him a headache. ``With
all that raw gas burning, it was real bad. We couldn't get away
from the smell,'' he said.
   Mike Lupo, 42, Bosco's cousin, said: ``It really shook up the
city. There are a lot of people complaining that their houses and
cars are covered with an oily soot.
   ``Yesterday it got so bad, there was this haze for three or four
miles.''
   Gov. James Blanchard, speaking on the banks of the river
Tuesday, the state would review safety at the 13 Michigan spots
where petroleum products are offloaded.
   The missing Jupiter crewman, Tom Sexton, 46, of Iowa, was
believed to have died while trying to swim ashore from the burning
tanker. Three other crew members, who were thrown or jumped from
the tanker, remained hospitalized Tuesday in fair condition.

   The top State Department official
for Africa flew into the burning capital of Liberia on Tuesday and
met with a rebel leader at the U.S. Embassy as machine-guns rattled
outside.
   Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen arrived in Monrovia
aboard a Marine helicopter and met rebel leader Prince Johnson, who
he described later as ``helpful and pro-democratic,'' the British
Broadcasting Corp. reported.
   Volleys of shots could be heard outside the white-walled embassy
in the diplomatic enclave at Mamba Point. The embassy is guarded by
part of a 2,100-member Marine contingent flown to Liberia in August
to evacuate and protect foreigners.
   Cohen hoped to meet later with rival rebel leader Charles Taylor
in neighboring Ivory Coast, to ``bring Taylor to the peace table or
into the national interim government of Liberia,'' said a U.S.
diplomat in Freetown.
   Taylor started the war in December when he invaded from Ivory
Coast. Johnson, Taylor's former aide, split off to form his own
group and managed to seize most of the capital before Taylor got
there. His troops shot and captured President Samuel Doe earlier
this month, and Doe died in captivity.
   Johnson has embraced a peace plan put forward by the Economic
Community of West African States to install an interim government
that would organize fair elections.
   But Taylor calls it a plot to install a puppet government. He
has refused to talk peace before the departure of a 3,000-man West
African peacekeeping force - which arrived in Monrovia on Aug. 24.
   Shelling by Taylor's troops left five members of the West
African force dead last week. Ghana and Nigeria responded by
bombing Taylor's troops.
   Meanwhile, the remaining soldiers loyal to the late president
have run amok in the capital, looting and torching buildings and
skirmishing with the rebels.
   Brig. Gen. David Nimley, who took over from Doe, said Monday his
troops were fighting through downtown Monrovia toward the port to
protect members of their faction waiting there to be evacuated, the
BBC reported.
   Nimley accused the five-nation West African task force of
failing to protect Doe's people from the rebels. The task force
includes troops from Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea and
Gambia.
   More than 5,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in Liberia's
war.

<HEAD>Second Summer of Alaska Beach Cleanup Ends, Buried Blobs Feared</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The second summer cleanup of beaches
tarred with crude oil spilled from the Exxon Valdez ended with
state officials still worried that buried blobs of oil could cause
more environmental damage.
   Exxon crews scoured contaminated shorelines for five months,
starting in April, to remove oil left through the winter after the
987-foot tanker slammed onto a reef in March 1989 and spilled
nearly 11 million gallons into Prince William Sound.
   Most beaches still covered with oil after the agitation of
typically violent winter storms were cleaned up, but many large
collections of crude oil lie offshore, covered by shifting sand and
gravel.
   ``The same forces that buried it can unbury it,'' state
spokesman Ernie Piper said.
   Gov. Steve Cowper said he's worried that oil untouched by the
cleanup will ``leach toxic substances for a long, long time.''
   Initially, 1,245 miles were coated with spilled oil, Piper said.
At the start of the 1990 cleanup, about 100 miles of beach remained
tainted, he said.
   By Saturday, when Exxon shut down operations for the winter,
only four miles were classified as heavily oiled, Piper said.
   Cowper commended Exxon and the Coast Guard for what was
accomplished, but fretted about the environmental future of the
area where thousands of animals live and breed.
   ``I don't think we'll ever see the point where the spiller and
the regulator will ever agree to everything,'' Cowper said last
week. ``It's our job to bark at the heels of everyone. It's our
beach.''
   There is no agreement about how to best deal with buried oil.
Some say it should be dug up, others say environmental disruption
caused by digging would be worse than leaving the oil untouched.
   Otto Harrison, Exxon's general manager in Alaska, said cleanup
work and winter wave action produced ``a rapid recovery'' of Prince
William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska.
   The oil company pointed to a record 1990 salmon catch as partial
proof. Fishermen hauled in 43 million pink salmon, nearly 50
percent more than the record set in 1987. The salmon have a
two-year life cycle, meaning the ones caught this year were those
that swam out to sea in 1989, during the height of the spill.
   Inspectors said this year's catch was high quality.
   Coast Guard Rear Adm. David Ciancaglini said he was happy with
the second summer cleanup and discounted the flurry of state
complaints accompanying its close.
   ``The controversy is over as far as I'm concerned,'' he said.
``Let's get out of here on a happy note and do whatever we have to
do to finish up next year.''
   Exxon said it would resume the cleanup in 1991 if the Coast
Guard decides it is needed. The state plans to draw up its own list
of areas to be cleaned. The oil company said it spent $2 billion on
the cleanup in 1989 and $200 million more this year.

   A suspect arrested last month in
an alleged coup plot to topple President Said Mohamed Djohar has
died in custody, official Radio Comores announced.
   Said Mlinde showed no signs of bruises or other signs of
mistreatment when he was rushed from his jail cell to Al Maarouf
hospital Saturday in a coma, the radio said Monday. It gave no
other details.
   Mlinde, a postal worker, was one of about 20 people arrested for
plotting against Djohar, elected in March to lead this string of
islands in the Indian Ocean that became independent from France in
1975.
   Djohar became interim president in November when President Ahmed
Abdallah Abderrahmane died in a dispute with French mercenary Bob
Denard, who had been in charge of Abdallah's Presidential Guard.
   French Judge Chantal Pedrix last week charged one of Denard's
men, Jean-Paul Guerrier, with assassinating Abdallah. Denard, who
fled to South Africa, admits being in the room when Abdallah was
shot but said he wasn't responsible for his death.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. syphilis rate is at its highest level in
40 years, and the biggest increase in the sexually transmitted
disease has been among blacks, according to a federal study.
   A separate study also published in Wednesday's Journal of the
American Medical Association says the common, inexpensive methods
of treating gonorrhea should be abandoned because of sharp rises in
both the penicillin-resistant and tetracycline-resistant strains of
the disease.
   In the first study, researchers at the Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta report a 34 percent increase in the number of
Americans treated for syphilis between 1981 and 1989.
   They said 18.4 of every 100,000 Americans were treated for
syphilis last year, up from the 13.7 cases per 100,000 treated in
1981.
   The 1989 rate was higher than at any time since 1949, the study
said.
   The overall rate has risen most sharply in the last four years,
which may be an indication that precautions spurred in the early
1980s by the AIDS outbreak are on the wane, said one of the study's
authors, Dr. Allyn K. Nakashima of the CDC's division of sexually
transmitted diseases.
   ``Obviously the message has not gotten out to certain groups,''
Nakashima said in a telephone interview Monday.
   Especially worrisome though, the study's authors say, is the
high rate among blacks. The study shows the incidence of syphilis
among blacks more than doubled between 1985 and 1989, to 121.8
cases from 52.6 cases per 100,000 people.
   In contrast, syphilis rates among white males have dropped by 69
percent since 1982. The disease rate for white females remained low
and unchanged.
   Data for the study came from quarterly and annual reports sent
to the CDC by state health departments over the nine-year period
reviewed.
   Researchers were unable to give concrete reasons for the
differences between the racial groups, although they suggest that
the higher rate among blacks may be linked to a higher incidence of
drug abuse, poverty and homelessness.
   ``This is just one more problem that can be attached to that
disenfranchised group,'' Nakashima said.
   Commenting on the new study, the March of Dimes Birth Defects
Foundation said in a statement that it has seen ``a shocking 186
percent jump'' in the number babies born with syphilis passed on by
infected mothers in the last five years.
   ``The ravages of syphilis among newborns closely follow trends
in infection among women,'' said Dr. Reed V. Tuckson, a senior vice
president at the March of Dimes in White Plains, N.Y. ``The
resurgence of this disease among adults is clearly reflected by a
rapid rise in the number of babies who develop serious disorders
and die.''
   The gonorrhea study shows that, although the incidence of the
disease has decreased since 1975, there is an increasing problem
with infections caused by strains that are resistant to treatment
with penicillin and tetracycline.
   In the study conducted from September 1987 through December
1988, researchers examined 6,204 cases from 21 clinics nationwide
and 21 percent showed potential for resistance to both treatments
as well as two other often used drugs, cefoxitin and spectinomycin.
   Results of the study helped the CDC write new guidelines, which
were published last year, for treating gonorrhea.
   The CDC recommends gonorrhea be treated with ceftriaxone. It's
at least seven times more expensive and is the only treatment that
all of the disease's strains have been susceptible to, said the
study's primary author, Dr. Sandra K. Schwarcz, also of the CDC.
   But the practice has not caught on yet in many areas, said Dr.
Jane Schwebke, assistant director of programs for sexually
transmitted diseases at the Harborview Medical Center in Seattle.
   ``In the outlying areas a lot of people are still using
penicillin, which can be a problem,'' she said.

   Five senators asked federal health officials
Tuesday to investigate a California foundation that allegedly
misused funds it raised to help patients needing bone marrow
transplants.
   The senators said in a letter they were disturbed about
complaints from transplant patients and their families who said
they had difficulty getting Life-Savers Foundation of America to
account for funds contributed for specific patients.
   By mid-1990, the foundation reported it had raised more than
$7.6 million under a contract with the National Marrow Donor
Program, the lawmakers said.
   Under the $500,000 contract signed in May 1989, the foundation
was to recruit bone-marrow donors, conduct public education
campaigns about the need for donors and raise money for testing of
potential donors, said Douglas A. Shaw, executive director of the
marrow donor program.
   The program terminated the agreement June 27 this year, charging
the foundation breached the contract by failing to submit the names
of thousands of recruited donors to the program's national
registry.
   ``By withholding the names ... it meant that when we searched
our computers (for names of potential donors) we were missing about
21,600 names,'' Shaw said.
   The donor program went to court to force the foundation to turn
over the names. Shaw said it appeared the foundation was trying to
start its own donor registry. He said about 10,000 names have been
turned over, so far.
   Spokeswoman Susan Rafkin said officials at the Covina,
Calif.-based foundation could not comment because they had not
received the senators' letter. She said the foundation welcomes any
inquiries into its activities.
   The program, established by Congress in 1984 and partially
finance with federal funds, has about 200,000 names of potential
donors in its registry. It is based in St. Paul, Minn.
   The foundation's contract involved working with patients trying
to find a suitable bone-marrow donor, Shaw said. The funds raised
by the foundation were to be used to offset laboratory-testing
costs incurred by patients searching for an appropriately matched
donor, Shaw said.
   However, families have complained that Life-Savers refused to
pay some laboratory bills incurred by patients for whom the group
had received contributions, and then refused to turn over the funds
contributed for that patient to another organization, the senators
said.
   ``We find such charges deeply disturbing,'' said the letter to
Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan.
   Sullivan's office had no comment.
   The letter was signed by Sens. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., Barbara
Mikulski, D-Md., Al Gore, D-Tenn., Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Dave
Durenberger, R-Minn.

   The Senate passed a $4 billion spending bill
for the District of Columbia Tuesday, but disputes over abortion
language, gay rights and aid for artists at a city university must
still be worked out between House and Senate lawmakers.
   The Senate version of the bill, passed without debate, contains
abortion language that prompted President Bush to twice veto the
bill last year.
   The bill also contains a controversial amendment that permits
private volunteer organizations in the district, such as the Big
Brothers, to set their own policies on whether to allow homosexuals
to serve as mentors for minors.
   Gay rights groups vehemently opposed this measure, introduced by
Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo. The House version of the bill
contains no such provision.
   The legislation passed by the Senate also restores $1.6 million
for the University of the District of Columbia that the House had
blocked. The House struck the money after some members complained
that ``The Dinner Party,'' was erotic and should not receive
federal support.
   The Senate bill restored that money and required the university
to make quarterly financial reports to the House and Senate
Appropriations Committees.
   The Senate abortion language, however, may prove to be the most
controversial amendment in the package.
   The bill would allow the city to use locally-raised tax money to
pay for Medicaid abortions and would allow the federal government
to reimburse the city for the costs of abortions performed in cases
where the pregnancy either endangered the life of the mother or is
the result of rape or incest.
   The White House has said that Bush's advisers will recommend a
veto unless it prohibits the use of all funds - federal or local -
to pay for abortions except where the mother's life would be
endangered.
   The House version of the bill contained more restrictive
abortion language.
   House and Senate conferees must meet to resolve these
differences.
   The federal government will pay the city $430.5 million for tax
revenue lost on federally-owned property. Congress has not
increased its contribution to the city tax base since 1985, despite
a surge in local property values.
   The Senate version of the bill would authorize $371 million more
than the previous year.

<HEAD>Butte Supervisors Vote To Accept Bailout Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OROVILLE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Butte County supervisors narrowly
averted the nation's first county bankruptcy Tuesday by approving
an $11.1 million bailout offered by Gov. George Deukmejian.
   The board voted 3-2 to accept the Republican governor's
proposal, which local officials said will avert immediate
bankruptcy but won't stave off the possibility of bankruptcy next
year.
   ``We're only putting off the inevitable,'' said Supervisor Hack
McInturf.
   County officials blamed the expense of programs required by the
state.
   Under the agreement, Deukmejian proposed deferring payment of
more than $6.3 million owed the state for fire protection services,
postponed the state's demand for payment of a $2 million matching
share for a new Butte County jail and offered a $1.15 million
direct cash grant.
   The proposal also calls for the county to raise some $1.65
million by boosting local fees, including property tax collections
and jail booking fees. The payment deferrals will allow the county
to use those funds for local programs and services.
   In return, the county agreed to scale back requests for new law
enforcement services, increases in pay for county workers and other
programs. The county said earlier it needed $14.1 million to keep
from going bankrupt, a figure that included expanded jail
facilities and more deputies.
   The agreement followed weeks of acrimonious negotiations between
the state and the county, which is last among California's 58
counties in the amount of money it spends per capita on government
services, and last in the proportion of sheriff's deputies to
population.
   The county in northern Califrnia is largely rural, with an
economy based on ranching and farming, and has less than 200,000
people. Oroville, the county seat, is 66 miles north of Sacramento.
   The crisis arose after county officials were unable to balance
this year's $155 million budget.
   They complained that fully 85 percent of their money was locked
into existing programs by state statute - such as welfare and
health care for the poor, and fire protection services.
   Board chairman Ed McLaughlin, along with the County Supervisors
Association of California, said that since the state didn't fully
reimburse the county for the mandated services, the county was
forced to cut local services in order to finance the state's
demands.
   McLaughlin voted against accepting the agreement, saying the
county had earlier pledged to declare bankruptcy unless the state
offered the full $14.1 million.

<HEAD>Toothpaste, Mouthwash Makers Must Prove Plaque-Reduction Claims</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Makers of toothpastes and mouthwashes claiming
to prevent plaque and other dental conditions must prove their
products work, federal health officials said Tuesday.
   The Food and Drug Administration told manufacturers to submit
data supporting their claims within the next six months.
   Several toothpaste and mouthwash manufacturers have been heavily
promoting their products' ability to reduce or prevent plaque,
tartar and other deposits on teeth and guard against gum disease
and other dental conditions.
   The FDA said these statements amount to drug claims because they
deal with the treatment or prevention of disease and because they
affect the structure or function of the body.
   Under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, manufacturers
making drug claims must show that the ingredients in their products
are safe and effective, the agency said.
   If the claims cannot be supported with scientific data,
manufacturers would have to remove such claims from the labels of
their products, the FDA said.
   The American Dental Association welcomed the FDA's action.
   ``It's well known that many of these products are effective in
reducing plaque and problems related to plaque,'' said Philip
Weintraub, a spokesman for the association.
   The association has given its ``seal of acceptance'' to several
toothpaste and mouthwash manufacturers that make anti-plaque
claims, he said.
   ``We've looked at their extensive clinical data and determined
(their products) are safe and will perform as the manufacturers say
they will,'' he said.
   The FDA request for data was to be published in the Federal
Register on Wednesday.
   The agency considered oral health-care products years earlier in
its review of nonprescription drugs, but much research has been
conducted since then on plaque and its prevention, an FDA
spokeswoman said.
   Plaque is a thin deposit on teeth that promotes bacteria growth.
Studies have implicated plaque in the development of cavities and
to gingivitis, a painful inflammation of the gums.
   Some manufacturers claim that the abrasives in their toothpaste
scrapes off plaque. Some mouth rinses claim to remove plaque
through antimicrobial or chemical activity.

   A Soviet newspaper Tuesday published an article by
Alexander Solzhenitsyn urging a populist revival of democracy and
spirituality in Russia without Western cultural ``garbage'' or
capitalist exploitation.
   ``The time of Communism is over,'' the exiled Nobel laureate
wrote. ``But its concrete structure hasn't collapsed yet. And let
us not find ourselves under its rubble instead of becoming free.''
   Solzhenitsyn, 71, wrote the article at his home in Cavendish,
Vt. It was published in a special supplement to the reformist
newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda and took up the equivalent of four
full pages.
   The publication of Solzhenitsyn's hopes for his homeland
represented another step in his official re-emergence in the Soviet
Union. His long-banned books are being published in the nation that
expelled him in 1974 for treason, and last month, President Mikhail
Gorbachev ordered his citizenship restored.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda's circulation is 22 million. The article
also will be published in this week's Literaturnaya Gazeta, a
literary journal with a circulation of 4.5 million.
  individuals sick with severe illnesses
such as lung cancer and in great financial need get paid before
those with less pressing ailments.
   Weinstein appointed a former federal Judge, Marvin Frankel, to
hold hearings on whether a class action is warranted on the claims
against the Manville trust.
   After similar hearings, Frankel earlier this month ruled that
Eagle-Picher qualified for a class action. The company, which makes
industrial products, has more than 64,000 lawsuits pending and is
being named in 20,000 more a year.
   Frankel said Eagle-Picher faces insolvency because of its
liability. Weinstein is expected to rule on whether to approve a
class action at a hearing next week, though lawyers for the company
and plaintiffs have not yet agreed on how the money would be paid
in such a settlement.
   In addition to a financial restructuring covered by Manville's
$520 million infusion, Weinstein has ordered the trust to alter the
way it pays claims to meet those with the greatest need first.
Currently, claims are resolved based the time of filing.

<TEXT>
   Somebody asked Chris Rock, one of two new
members of the ``Saturday Night Live'' cast introduced at a news
conference Tuesday, if he felt ``haunted by the ghost of Eddie
Murphy.''
   Rock looked nonplussed. ``Eddie's still alive, ain't he?'' he
said. Rock, 23, a standup comedian since age 18, then allowed that
he was bringing his own perspective to the 16th season of the
late-night NBC variety show.
   ``I always wanted to be, like, a black guy on `Saturday Night
Live,''' said Rock, an 8-year-old when ``SNL'' premiered in 1975.
Murphy, who joined the show in 1980, went to become one of the
nation's biggest box office draws.
   ``I always wanted to be on it, too,'' said stocky, blond,
blue-eyed Chris Farley, 26, a former Second City trouper, and the
other new member of the cast. A native of Wisconsin, Farley is a
graduate of Marquette University. He joined the Chicago comedy
troupe in the fall of 1988 and traveled with The Second City
National Touring Company.
   Rock makes his home in Brooklyn's Fort Greene neighborhood ``a
block over from Spike,'' he said, referring to moviemaker Spike
Lee.
   Rock and Farley are replacing Jon Lovitz and Nora Dunn, who have
left the show to pursue other ventures in the entertainment
business.
   The returning cast members are Dana Carvey, Dennis Miller, Jan
Hooks, Phil Hartman, Victoria Jackson, Kevin Nealon and Mike Myers.
The two Chrises are ``featured performers'' with A. Whitney Brown
and Al Franken.
   ``I think this will be a great season and I think you'll see
lots of new characters,'' said the show's producer, Lorne Michaels.
   The season premiere with host Kyle MacLachlan, who plays
demented FBI agent Dale Cooper on ABC's ``Twin Peaks, and musical
guest Sinead O'Connor.
   Last season, O'Connor and departing cast member Dunn boycotted
the show which had raunch comedian Andrew Dice Clay as its host.
The show was the season's highest-rated.
   Other ``SNL'' guest hosts slated for the new season include
``All My Children'' soap opera star Susan Lucci, former New York
Yankees president George Steinbrenner, musician Paul Simon, and
actors Patrick Swayze, Christian Slater and Tom Hanks, Michaels
said.

<TEXT>
   The commander of Syrian
troops in the Saudi desert described his men Tuesday as a buffer
between the feuding Arab brothers of Arabia and Iraq, and said of
Saddam Hussein: ``I hope that he dies very soon.''
   Gen. Mohammed Deeb Dhaher, opening his camp to reporters for the
first time, said his battle-hardened commandos could shift quickly
into offensive posture if their orders were changed.
   ``The Syrians are here for the defense of Saudi Arabia, but if
they have to go for offense they will be ready,'' said Dhaher, who
said all of his men have experience fighting in Lebanon.
   The Syrians, who have photographs of President Hafez Assad at
the entrance of their camp, are the fittest-looking and most
experienced of all the Arab forces on the front lines in the
multinational defense of Saudi Arabia. But their numbers are low
pending reinforcements.
   While several hundred of his colleagues jogged across the desert
in formation, soldier Ramzi Salim said the Syrians would have no
problem fighting with Americans if hostilities erupt with the Iraqi
forces to the north in occupied Kuwait.
   ``Everyone in the world is against Saddam Hussein,'' Salim said.
``Kuwait will be Kuwait again.''
   Nodding nearby was another commando, Mohammed Nosra, who said
the Syrians were ``proud to be in Saudi Arabia to defend the holy
mosques and ready to stop any army that makes aggression against an
Arab.''
   Gen. Dhaher, wearing a skull and sword inginia on his uniform,
nodded yes when asked if he would have fought wth Iraq if Assad had
ordered him to do so. ``We are soldiers,'' he said, adding, ``We
would not have been as enthusiatic about our mission.''
   Saddam and Assad head rival wings of the Baath Party. Prior to
the invasion of Kuwait, Assad figured more prominently on the list
of U.S. troubles in the Mideast than did Saddam. U.S.
administrations accuse Syria of harboring terrorists.
   The Saudi government the past month has been taking reporters on
weekly trips to Arab camps near Hafr al Batin, in the northern
Arabian desert about 65 miles from the Kuwaiti border. But until
Tuesday the Syrians had not opened their camp, which is near camps
of Saudi, Kuwaiti and Egyptian forces.
   The Syrians are about 1,200 strong, with armored units said to
be on the way. At the moment the commandos have virtually no
equipment other than what they carry on their backs and belts.
   For now, the Syrians and 2,000 Egyptian front-line forces are
more a political statement than a military force.
   The American forces, which have been fortifying their forward
positions with tanks and other heavy armor and artillery in the
past two weeks, remain in most areas about 30 miles behind the Arab
forces.
   At the Kuwaiti camp, officers acknowledged that about 70 percent
of the 20,000-strong Army has been lost as a result of the Aug. 2
Iraqi invasion, including a good number of Kuwaiti troops who were
on vacation when Iraq invaded.
   But the Kuwaiti commanders said they wanted to lead any
offensive action to force Iraq from Kuwait.

   An assailant shot and wounded the
former governor of Gibraltar and his wife Tuesday night at their
home in northern England.
   Police said the attack had the ``connotations'' of an IRA
action.
   Air Chief Marshall Sir Peter Terry and Lady Terry were treated
for gunshot wounds from the 9 p.m. attack at their home in Milford,
a village near Stafford about 130 miles northwest of London.
   ``I understand that Sir Peter has sustained a serious gunshot
wound ... but that Lady Terry has only a very slight injury,'' said
Assistant Chief Constable Graham Goulding.
   Terry was governor and commander-in-chief of Gibraltar from 1985
until he retired in 1989.
   In March 1988, British SAS soldiers shot and killed Irish
Republican Army guerrillas Mairead Farrell, Danny McCann and Sean
Savage about 500 yards from Terry's home. British authorities said
the unarmed rebels were apprehended planting a car bomb.
   Staffordshire police were searching for a man seen running from
the Terrys' home.
   Asked if he thought the IRA was involved, Goulding replied,
``Maybe it's a little early to draw that conclusion, and no one has
claimed responsibility at this stage. But of course it has the
obvious connotations of similar events.''
   The IRA has attacked British targets overseas in its campaign to
drive the British out of the province of Northern Ireland and unite
it with the Irish Republic.

   Nine European nations called on the U.N. Security
Council Tuesday to impose an air embargo on Iraq and agreed to
coordinate their air and ground forces in the Persian Gulf.
   Defense and foreign ministers of the Western European Union,
meeting in Paris, urged the Security Council to quickly endorse
closing Iraq's air routes to enforce the economic embargo imposed
after the invasion of Kuwait.
   The Security Council has already endorsed the use of naval force
to back up the embargo.
   The decision follows a dramatic rise in tensions between Europe
and Iraq following raids last week by Iraqi soldiers on the
diplomatic quarters of at least four nations in Kuwait.
   The meeting of the Western European Union follows agreement
Monday by the 12-nation European Community to expel Iraqi military
aides and restrict movements of Iraq's diplomats in their capitals.
   The EC also was acting in retaliation for the raids Friday on
the ambassadorial residences or embassies of France, Belgium and
Canada in Kuwait, and an earlier raid against the Dutch compound.
The troops briefly detained the French military attache and took
three other French nationals prisoner.
   France responded by expelling 29 Iraqis, proposing to extend the
U.N. embargo of Iraq to air traffic, and promising to dispatch
warplanes, tanks, helicopters and 4,200 soldiers to Saudi Arabia.
   France, current president of the Western European Union, called
Tuesday's meeting.
   There are currently 28 warships in the gulf region belonging to
the nine Western European Union nations. But only Britain and
France have committed ground troops in the gulf.
   The Netherlands offered Tuesday to send a squadron of 18 F-16
jet fighters to Turkey if the United Nations declares an air
blockade.
   France and Britain, the other Western European power with
significant forces in the region, wanted their WEU allies to send
at least token ground troops, according to diplomatic sources.
   The WEU is the sole European body dealing with defense issues.
Its members include nine of the 12 European Community nations.
Neutral Ireland, Greece and Denmark are not members.
   U.N. diplomats on Sunday began drafting a new resolution to
close Iraq's air routes and punish nations flouting the economic
embargo, U.S. officials said.
   An air blockade would involve the interception of planes
approaching Iraq and would pose a far greater danger of triggering
hostilities than the boarding of ships in the Persian Gulf.

<HEAD>Senate Votes on Garbage Ban Proposed by Coats</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate endorsed a measure Tuesday that
would allow states to close their borders to other states' garbage
to protect shrinking landfill capacity.
   Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., said the proposal would give ``every
state the right to determine its own destiny'' in managing trash
through bans or higher fees for out-of-state waste.
   ``I wanted a fair shot at this,'' the freshman senator said
after prevailing over the objections of New Jersey Democratic
senators Bill Bradley and Frank Lautenberg on a 68-31 vote. ``I'm
content with it.''
   Under Coats' proposal, offered as an amendment to the District
of Columbia appropriations bill, states could block garbage imports
as long as they had a 20-year solid waste plan in place.
   Bradley and Lautenberg, concerned their state would be overrun
by trash if the measure were to become law, promised to continue
fighting when the appropriations bill reaches a House-Senate
conference committee.
   The D.C. appropriations bill is also in danger of a presidential
veto because it contains abortion funding language that led to two
vetoes last year.
   Coats promised a tough fight to keep his measure alive.
   ``If it's knocked out, we'll be back next year. At minimum, we
have established a 2-to-1 majority to do something about this
problem.''
   Lautenberg has accused Coats of playing election-year politics
with the garbage issue. ``We knew we were on the less-popular side
of the issue,'' he said.
   New Jersey is the largest exporter of solid waste to Indiana
landfills, which are eight to 10 years from reaching their
capacity, Coats said.
   ``The amendment would give any state the power to impose
unlimited, punitive fees on out-of-state garbage,'' said
Lautenberg, who said bans could be imposed suddenly and without
Environmental Protection Agency review. ``A state writes its own
ticket.''
   Bradley and Lautenberg charged the Coats measure would block
development of a comprehensive national solid waste policy by
pitting state against state. They said it also would undermine
recycling. New Jersey has set a 60 percent recycling goal by 1995.

   Kuwait's national airline has moved its
headquarters to Cairo and will start operating there next month, an
airline official said Tuesday.
   Abdel-Razzak al-Otaki, manager of the Cairo office, said eight
Boeing planes that were outside Kuwait when Iraqi troops invaded
his country Aug. 2 will be used.
   ``The main goal is to keep the Kuwaiti flag flying in foreign
capitals and countries,'' al-Otaki said in a telephone interview.
   On Monday, Iraq ordered the dissolution of Kuwait Airways and
transferred all its assets to the government-run Iraqi Airways.
Baghdad also dissolved all offices of the Kuwaiti flagship air
carrier abroad and dismissed its personnel.
   The move to transfer the headquarters of the company to Cairo
began even before the dissolution order was announced in Iraq,
Al-Otaki said.
   He said destinations from Cairo would be the United States and
countries in Europe, the Middle East, the Persian Gulf and Asia.
   The eight-plane fleet includes Boeing 747 jumbo and 767
airliners.

   The United States is withdrawing about
60,000 of its quarter-million troops from West Germany as part of a
major cutback of U.S. forces abroad, the West German Defense
Ministry said Tuesday.
   A statement said most of the reduction would be completed by
1993. In Washington, the Pentagon said it was ending U.S. military
operations at 94 sites and reducing them at 14 other locations in
West Germany.
   The Pentagon said the disolution of Cold War conflicts was
allowing cutbacks at 150 bases in 10 countries around the world.
   Many West Germans have chafed at the U.S. troop presence as an
obstacle to achieving full national sovereignty. Residents near
U.S. bases complain about the noise of training flights and the
disruption caused by frequent exercises.
   West German officials have said the houses of the departing U.S.
troops could be used by hundreds of thousands of immigrants from
Eastern Europe who have flooded into the country the last year.

   Ezra Taft Benson, the 91-year-old
president of the Mormon Church, was hospitalized Tuesday for an
unspecified ailment.
   LDS Hospital spokesman Tim Madden said Benson was admitted about
12:30 p.m. for observation and was in fair condition.
   Madden declined to detail why Benson, who served as secretary of
agriculture in the Eisenhower Administration, was taken to the
hospital.
   Church spokesman Don LeFevre said doctors expected to keep
Benson overnight. He didn't know what the church leader's ailment
was.
   Benson, who became president of the 7.5 million-member church in
1985, was last hospitalized for four days in June for treatment of
a bacterial infection.
   In November 1986, Benson had a heart pacemaker implanted to
control episodes during which his heartbeat was slowing.
   Frail because of his age, Benson has attended but hasn't
addressed recent general conferences of the church.

<TEXT>
   The House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday
approved a plan under which makers of computer softwear could bar
video stores and others from renting them to customers.
   Manufacturers have complained that the rentals of video games
are cutting into sales.
   The bill sponsored by Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., is similar to a
law already passed by Congress under which record manufacturers are
allowed to bar rentals.
   The measure sailed through Judiciary Committee on a voice vote
despite objections from video rental store operators.
   Sponsors are expected to push for early action on the measure,
with Congress expected to leave Washington for the campaign trail
in a matter of weeks. The Senate already has passed similar
legislation.
   The idea behind the bill is that it is easy to copy both records
and computer softwear stored on floppy discs. The rentals are
therefore considered to undercut the copyrights held by the
manufacturers.
   Games often cost between $40 and $50.
   Under the bill, manufacturers would have the option of allowing
rentals or barring them.
   In the case of records, most makers do not allow rentals.
   Actually, the bill applies to a wide range of computer softwear
in addition to video games, but the rental of games by stores that
specialize mainly in renting movies is the main focus of the issue.
   The Japanese manufacturer Nintendo asked to have its games
included in the bill, but the committee balked at that. Lawmakers
said Nintendo games are not readily copied and therefore, the
company's copyrights are not endangered by rentals.
   The bill specifies that the measure not only does not apply to
Nintendo but also softwear embodied in machines, such as cars and
microwaves.

<HEAD>Suspected Murderer of Presidential Candidate Escapes Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man accused of slaying a leading
presidential candidate, whose death led to a year-old war between
the government and drug traffickers, escaped Tuesday from a Bogota
prison, police said.
   Jaime Rueda Rocha was one of three suspects being held in the
shooting death of Liberal Party candidate Sen. Luis Carlos Galan on
Aug. 18, 1989.
   Radio reports said Rueda Rocha used documents provided by his
lawyer to persuade prison workers to let him leave the facility.
   A police spokeswoman said officials were investigating how Rueda
Rocha escaped. She confirmed on condition of anonymity that Rueda
Rocha's lawyer, Carlos Caicedo, had been visiting him at the time
of his escape.
   Rueda Rocha was arrested a month after Galan's murder. The
government blamed the Medellin cocaine cartel for masterminding the
candidate's slaying, which led to a major crackdown on drug
traffickers.
   One of the tactics used by the government in its crackdown that
most angered the drug kingpins was extraditing traffickers wanted
in the United States on drug-running and money laundering charges.
   The cartel responded with an assassination and bombing campaign,
which in the past year killed about 550 people, including three
presidential candidates. During that period, the group reportedly
detonated 300 bombs nationwide.
   A domestic airliner also exploded in air shortly after takeoff
from Bogota's airport, killing more than 100 people.
   On July 27, the Medellin cartel declared a unilateral truce in
its war against the government.
   On Tuesday, a statement signed by cocaine barrons calling
themselves ``The Extraditables'' said despite army claims, they did
not intend to resume their bombings of government targets for now.
   Last weekend the army found 1,000 pounds of dynamite in a
northeastern Colombian region where the leader of the Medellin
cartel, Pablo Escobar, is said to own vast tracks of land.

Stance</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter was
praised by friends Tuesday as a strong supporter of civil
liberties, but a feminist leader called him ``a total disaster for
civil rights and women's rights.''
   The Senate Judiciary Committee, which completed three days of
questioning Souter on Monday, turned its attention to about 40
witnesses testifying for and against him.
   His confirmation as the high court's 105th justice - and a key
vote on such divisive issues as abortion, civil rights and
church-state relations - seemed certain.
   Before Tuesday's hearings began, Molly Yard, president of the
National Organization for Women, told reporters her group had begun
a major drive to block Souter's confirmation.
   ``We know that man will be a fifth vote to overturn Roe vs.
Wade,'' Ms. Yard said, referring to the 1973 Supreme Court decision
legalizing abortion. ``Our lives are on the line. Women in this
country are going to die. We're talking about your daughters, your
granddaughters. He is a disastrous choice, a total disaster for
civil rights and women's rights.''
   During the hearings, Ms. Yard appeared on the verge of tears as
she told the senators, all of them men, ``None of you will ever
face that problem (of an unwanted pregnancy). Not one of you.''
   Eleanor Smeal of the Fund for the Feminist Majority held up a
bracelet bearing the name of a 17-year-old, Becky Bell, she
identified as ``a victim of the parental consent law of Indiana.''
She said the girl died after obtaining an illegal abortion.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he was impressed by the testimony
of Ms. Yard and Ms. Smeal, but added, ``There is another point of
view that is equally as moving.''
   Jerry Diamond, like Souter a former New Hampshire attorney
general, praised his friend's honesty and integrity. Diamond added:
``His central tenet is the dignity and freedom of the individual.
He is a strong supporter of civil liberties.''
   Steven McAuliffe of the New Hampshire Bar Association, whose
schoolteacher wife, Christa, died in the 1986 explosion of the
Challenger space shuttle, spoke of Souter's compassion.
   ``I have some experience with personal pain,'' McAuliffe said.
``I know many of you share my pain as I share yours. I want you to
know that David Souter feels and shares and understands the pain of
others with great compassion and great dignity.''
   The 14-member committee was expected to conclude its hearings
Wednesday, and vote on Souter's nomination next week. The
committee's recommendation then will go to the full Senate.
   Tuesday's first witnesses, Kate Michelman of the National
Abortion Rights Action League and Faye Wattleton of Planned
Parenthood, urged Souter's defeat.
   ``Judge Souter's personal qualifications are not at issue,'' Ms.
Michelman said. ``The issue is whether or not the Supreme Court
will continue to uphold the fundamental constitutional right to
privacy, including the right to choose.''
   Ms. Wattleton asked the senators to ``send a message that the
period of tolerance for political gamesmanship around our
fundamental reproductive rights has ended.''
   In three days of testimony, Souter steered clear of giving his
personal views on abortion or stating how he might vote if asked to
overturn Roe vs. Wade.
   But some of his answers made him appear more moderate than his
staunchly conservative reputation. In fact, several conservative
senators appeared concerned by some of Souter's testimony.
   Two senators on record as supporting abortion rights said
Tuesday the Souter opponents were engaging in poor strategy.
   ``I really believe you're making a big mistake,'' said Sen. Alan
Simpson, R-Wyo. ``I'm on your side but I think you're hurting your
cause.''
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said, ``It's not realistic to expect
that if Judge Souter is turned down, we will get a nominee who ...
will commit in advance to uphold Roe vs. Wade.''
   Specter noted that President Bush, who nominated Souter, favors
overturning the 1973 ruling.
   Howard Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus, said in
written testimony prepared for delivery Wednesday that Souter
should be opposed because he hasn't fought against abortion.
   Phillips cited Souter's tenure on a hospital governing board,
during which he voted to allow abortions at the facility in light
of the Roe v. Wade ruling.
   ``If... Mr. Souter believed each fetus to be a human person and
failed to act against the performance of abortion, he was morally
delinquent,'' Phillips said.
   Those testifying in favor of Souter's nomination were former
Attorney General Griffin Bell and former Virginia Gov. Gerald
Baliles.
   Bell said Souter ``has the right vision of our country and the
law of our country.'' Baliles, who has known Souter since both men
were deputy attorneys general of their respective states, said, ``I
believe he will serve with distinction.''
   Norma McCorvey, the woman who used the pseudonym Jane Roe when
her challenge to a Texas abortion law led to the Supreme Court's
1973 ruling, attended the hearing and urged Souter's defeat.
   Ms. McCorvey's lawyer, Gloria Allred, told the committee:
   ``David Souter ... claims that he may or may not sign a decision
returning millions of women to the fear and second-class status of
17 years ago. Perhaps he would relegate women to back-alley
abortions and unwanted pregnancies. Perhaps not. He's not quite
sure.''
   The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a leader in the
successful campaign to defeat Robert H. Bork's Supreme Court
nomination in 1987, urged the Senate to recall Souter for more
questioning.
   Joseph Rauh, the conference's chief lawyer, said Souter's
testimony that New Hampshire ``has no racial problems'' indicates
that Souter is insensitive to discriminatory practices and ``cannot
see what is right under his nose.''
   Rauh said there is ample proof that New Hampshire has racial
problems.

   The United States, Soviet Union, Britain,
France and China have agreed on the basic guidelines for an air
embargo on Iraq to cut it off from the rest of the world, a top
Soviet official said Tuesday.
   Those nations, which are the five permanent Security Council
members, are now refining the language of a council resolution so
it conforms to international air traffic laws, said Soviet Deputy
Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov.
   ``We don't want anyone to be hurt,'' he said, and then added:
``We just want to hurt Iraq, just a little.''
   U.N. diplomats and officials from the Permanent Five met Tuesday
to continue refining the text of the resolution.
   Defense ministers from nine West European nations agreed Tuesday
at a meeting in Paris to coordinate their air and ground forces in
the gulf and enforce the U.N. air embargo when it takes effect.
   Vorontsov and other diplomats said the full 15-member Security
Council is expected to pass the resolution within days, before
French President Francois Mitterrand arrives to deliver a speech
condemning Iraq on Monday before the General Assembly.
   Mitterrand was outraged by Iraqi raids last Friday on the
French, Belgian, Dutch and Canadian missions in occupied Kuwait, in
which three Frenchmen were abducted and diplomats were temporarily
detained.
   The council passed its seventh resolution condemning Iraq last
Sunday when it denounced the violation of diplomatic privileges.
   The next resolution, sources said, will extend the current naval
embargo to air traffic, block Iraqi goods shipments among other
nations, and call on all nations to restrict the operations of
Iraq's embassies.
   All countries would have to close their airspace to planes
approaching or leaving Iraq or occupied Kuwait.
   Only flights carrying refugees out of Iraq or Kuwait, or
bringing in medical supplies and food specifically authorized by
the Security Council would be allowed to travel to those nations.
   Planes could not be shot down; that is banned by the 1944
international civil aviation convention.
   The resolution would also make it clear that the trade embargo
resolution adopted on Aug. 6 covers commerce in services, which
will be specifically banned under the new resolution.
   At least one Western dredging company is still working in Iraq,
and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev said the 8,000 or so Soviet
civil and military advisors in Iraq were working there on service
contracts.
   Western diplomats said they hope the Soviet Union will use the
new resolution as the pretext for withdrawing its advisors in Iraq.

<HEAD>CIA Chief: Saddam Capable of Terrorism, But Will He Attack?</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: SUBS lead to CORRECT that Webster determining Saddam's

<TEXT>
   Iraq's terrorist capabilities, chemical
weapons and missiles pose a serious international threat, but it is
more difficult to determine whether Saddam Hussein intends to use
them, the CIA chief said Tuesday.
   Even before the crisis triggered by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait, the CIA was concerned about Saddam's links to Palestinian
terrorists who have attacked Western targets, CIA Director William
H. Webster said in the text of a New York speech.
   ``Now, he has both strong ties to Palestinian terrorists and an
elaborate network within his own intelligence service capable of
planning and carrying out terrorist attacks against a variety of
international targets,'' Webster told the Foreign Policy
Association.
   But the intelligence official added that ``capability - whether
in Iraq or in other nations - is easier to measure than intent.''
   ``Knowing the intent of world leaders requires the knowledge
that comes from human intelligence, which is often difficult ot
acquire,'' he said.
   Webster said h is putting additional emphasis on the CIA's
``human intelligence capability,'' to measure the intentions of
leaders involved in conflicts. He gave no details of how such
information might be acquired.
   Iraq's sizable stockpile of chemical and biological weapons is
the largest in the Third World and can be delivered by a wide
variety of weapons, including bombs, shells and artillery rockets,
Webster said.
   ``What is even more troubling is Iraq's ambitious missile
development program - the most aggressive and advanced in the Arab
world,'' he added.
   In general, weapons of mass destruction are becoming easier to
obtain and terrorism could ``extend the battlefield worldwide'' in
future conflicts, Webster said.
   Based on intelligence assessments of Iraq, Webster said United
Nations sanctions have cut off 95 percent of Iraq's oil exports and
halted its efforts to recover from the eight-year war with Iran.
   The exodus of thousands of foreign workers, he said, has
hampered nearly all of Iraq's domestic industries.
   Webster said the CIA gets regular reports on more than 60 Iraqi
army divisions and on every tanker in Iraq's merchant marine fleet
as well as information about the effectiveness of economic
sanctions and the condition of foreign hostages in Iraq and Kuwait.
   CIA agents also are looking at U.S. relations with other Arab
countries whose populations Saddam is trying to influence.
   ``Saddam's ability to sway Arab public opinion - to convince
them that he is the `hero of the masses' - could over time
destabilize the region,'' Webster said.
   On U.S. relations with the Soviet Union, Webster said the recent
Helsinki summit between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev indicates ``a new world order.''
   But he said some concerns remain over Soviet actions, including
concerns among some Asian nations over the fact that reductions of
forces in Soviet Asia have been slower than those in areas near
Europe.
   ``In this era of new relationships, however, an understanding
between Moscow and some of these Asian countries is likely,''
Webster said.

   The publisher who threatened to close the New
York Post unless unions accepted $19 million in job and wage cuts
predicted Tuesday that profits will soon begin rolling in.
   More than 30 employees resigned and took sweetened severage
packages the day after the union holding up the concession deal
voted to take the cuts. Those leaving will get standard severance
pay, along with two months pay they would have received if the
189-year-old paper had shut down.
   Publisher Peter S. Kalikow, surrounded by union leaders and Post
managers, said he expected the tabloid known for racy headlines and
focus on urban crime to turn a profit by Oct. 1. If his prediction
is correct, it would be the first time since the 1970s the paper
became profitable.
   Kalikow said the Post has been losing about $27 million a year.
To secure $19 million in union concessions, he promised the unions
20 percent of company stock and a representative on the board of
directors.
   The remaining $8 million will be saved by other operating cost
reductions, including management wage cuts.
   At a news conference in his office, he thanked those assembled
for helping him save the nation's oldest continuously published
daily paper.
   ``We sat in meetings with these guys, we sat in halls, we sat in
bathrooms with them. They did a fabulous job,'' Kalikow said, also
thanking more than 100 departing employees and the hundreds who
will make less money.
   ``It's in no small part that we owe these people some thanks for
the sacrifices they made,'' Kalikow said. ``The mortgage rate
didn't go down. The price of food didn't go down. The price of gas
didn't go down.''
   The Newspaper Guild, which represents 350 news, advertising and
clerical staff, voted Monday to accept job reductions and a 20
percent pay cut by switching to a four-day workweek. Top pay for
reporters had been $853 a week.
   Ten other unions accepted concessions Friday.
   Kalikow said all the unions had to agree to concessions or he
would shut down the paper. Two years ago, Kalikow won $24 million
in concessions from the unions as a condition of his purchase of
the Post.
   Some Guild holdouts had said they would rather see the paper
close because they would get severance money and 60 days shut-down
pay. Kalikow countered by offering severance and shut-down pay to
anyone who resigns before 5 p.m. Wednesday.
   Daniel F. Cremins, Post executive vice president, said that in
addition to the Guild offer, four other unions will receive a
similar enhanced departure package.
   More than 30 Guild members had resigned by Tuesday afternoon,
Kalikow spokesman Howard Rubenstein said, adding that an
undisclosed number of executives would be let go and others face
pay cuts.
   ``I can't see going through this again,'' said Henry Scott, 61,
a publications clerk at the Post for 18 years who said he resigned
although his wife is fighting cancer. ``I think it's my best bet to
get out now. I can't take it anymore.''
   He expects to get more than $30,000 plus the 60 days pay.
   Some Post reporters were in tears Tuesday and refused comment.
Colleagues said they were upset because they were resigning.
   ``I have a morale problem right now. They're angry and they have
a right to be,'' said editor Jerry Nachman. In the news business
these days, he said, ``You learn sadly that the operational word is
'business.'''

<HEAD>Brazil Deactivates Nuclear Test Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazil on Tuesday scrapped a nuclear
test site at an air force base deep in the Amazonian jungle in a
ceremony to show the government's peaceful intentions in its
nuclear program.
   President Fernando Collor de Mello, acompanied by his three
military ministers, tossed a handful of dirt into a
1,000-foot-deep, concrete- and steel-lined hole that officials said
was constructed 10 years ago to test bombs. It was never used.
   ``The hole was adequate for an eventual nuclear test, but this
will not occur in the Brazil of President Collor de Mello,'' said
spokesman Claudio Humberto Rosa e Silva.
   The hole on the Serra do Cachimbo Air Force Base, 930 miles
northwest of Brasilia, was excavated in 1979 when Brazil was ruled
by its last military president, Gen. Joao Figueredo. Its existence
was a secret until four years ago. Even then, base officials
claimed it was used for testing equipment for a Brazilian space
program.
   Rosa e Silva said the hole was secretly constructed by the
National Security Council, a military agency that has since been
disbanded.
   Civilians took the reins of government in 1985 but full
democracy was not restored until last December's election victory
by Collor.
   The spokesman said Collor confirmed the existence of the hole
last week and decided to go personally to the site to ``signal his
position against secret military adventures.''
   In 1987, Brazil developed the means to enrich uranium, a crucial
step towards the construction of nuclear bombs, and the country now
has the capacity to make such weapons, according to the Brazilian
Society of Physics.
   Historically, the country's nuclear development programs have
been under control of separate branches of the armed forces,
independent of civilian control.
   Brazil has refused to sign the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty and as a result its nuclear program is not monitored by the
International Agency of Atomic Energy.
   Brazilian officials say the treaty is discriminatory because it
discourages the transfer of nuclear technology to developing
countries.
   Last week, Brazil and Argentina - the only two Latin American
countries that possess nuclear know-how - released a statement
promising not to utilize their knowledge to produce atomic wepaons.

<HEAD>Plant Linked to Libya Poison Gas Checked For Toxic Chemicals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cherry-flavoring plant that may have
been used by an Iraqi investor to acquire a poison gas ingredient
for Libya has been inspected by local regulators looking for
hazardous chemicals.
   But Louis Champon, owner of Product Ingredient Technology,
defended his chemical productin process and waste-disposal methods
during Monday's inspection, and once again said he had nothing to
do with his late Iraqi partner's links to Libya.
   Champon opened the Product Ingredient Technology factory last
year with $5 million from investor Ihsan Barbouti.
   Champon invented a process to extract bitter almond oil, a
natural ingredient used in cherry flavoring, from apricot pits. A
byproduct of the process is a cyanide compound.
   Champon said he unwittingly became involved in an effort by
Barbouti to export the factory's cyanide compounds to Libya, where
U.S. officials say they could be used in toxic weapons.
   Champon said he was unaware of Barbouti's alleged role as
contractor for the Libyan chemical weapons plant at Rabta. But
Barbouti, an Iraqi, made no secret of his affection for Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi, Champon said.
   ``Dr. Barbouti wanted me to fly the Libyan flag next to the
American flag at our building,'' Champon said Monday. ``He always
said how friendly he was with Gadhafi. But we kept politics to a
minimum.''
   Champon said seven barrels that stored ferric ferrocyanide, the
plant's byproduct, are missing. He was unsure if they were full
when they left the property.
   Although that cyanide compound is relatively safe, environmental
officials said it can be refined into deadly hydrogen cyanide and
other toxic compounds.
   Champon said his cyanide disposal method was simple: He poured
it down the drain. Boca Raton Fire-Rescue public information
officer Mike Duane said Monday that could have been illegal,
depending on the concentration of cyanide.
   Fire department inspectors and the state Department of
Environmental Regulation took samples Monday of unidentified raw
materials from the plant. Inspectors were uncertain when test
results would be available.
   Fire inspectors on Monday cited the building's owner, Norman
Stolack of Clark, N.J., for having a fire alarm system that doesn't
work. Champon said the alarms don't work because electricity was
turned off in July, when the plant closed for lack of money.
   Champon said he refused Barbouti's efforts to export the cyanide
byproducts to West Germany. He said he also refused to increase
Barbouti's share of the company from 50 percent to 80 percent.
   Disagreements between the men led Champon to file suit in July
1989 to sever their business relationship. Champon is seeking $100
million in damages, which he said is the potential value of his
business.
   U.S. Customs Service officials interviewed Champon last week
about his relationship with Barbouti. Champon said he had called
the State Department two weeks earlier to tell them that Barbouti,
who died in July and also has been linked to a chemical weapons
plant in Iraq, was his partner.

<HEAD>Smoking Implement Makers Plead Guilty in Drug Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four manufacturers of smoking implements
pleaded guilty Tuesday to conspiring to sell drug paraphernalia
through the mail in the first court victory for the federal
government in a nationwide investigation called Operation Pipe.
   Prosecutors said the pleas undermined the traditional defense
among such manufacturers: that their products are meant to be used
with tobacco, and how the buyers use them is their own business.
   The four businessmen and several others not yet prosecuted in a
302-count federal indictment, were wholesalers of water pipes,
roach clips, crack pipes and other items they claimed were used for
smoking tobacco.
   ``These people knew they were selling items used to ingest
drugs. They can't hide it any longer,'' said Henry Hudson, U.S.
attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.
   The government agreed to drop charges of money laundering and
conspiracy cases against other defendants in exchange for the four
guilty pleas, said prosecutor Larry Leiser.
   Defense attorneys said their clients also agreed to the deal in
light of the high cost of appeal.
   Randall Dyer, operator of Tobacco Accessories Distributing Co,
doing business as Choice Supply, Inc., in Alexandria, Va., pleaded
guilty Tuesday along with Page E. Weincek, William L. Love and John
M. Burgess.
   Weincek is the principal in RPM Associates, Inc., doing business
as Penguin Feather in Virginia and the District of Columbia. Love
was doing business as Octopus Garden in Manassas, Va., with its
principal owner, Burgess.
   All four defendants face a maximum of three years in jail, fines
of $250,000 and forfeiture of up to 20 percent of their assets.
Their businesses could be fined an additional $500,000, Hudson
said.
   ``This case is significant because it's the first major
prosecution of the purveyors of drug paraphernalia in the
country,'' he said.
   Hudson said Operation Pipe has confiscated more than $100
million nationwide, with $3 million of that in the Washington, D.C.
and Virginia area.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of rare teddy bears worth
thousands of dollars were bagged by thieves in a motel parking lot.
   About 300 stuffed toy bears, antiques and collectibles worth
about $60,000 were stolen Monday from a trailer carrying them from
a teddy bear convention in Baltimore, police said.
   The empty trailer and the truck hooked to it were found later in
Bridegport, said Milford police Officer Edward Kelly.
   Owner Larry Idema, of Grand Haven, Mich., was headed to Boston
when he stopped overnight at a motel, he said.
   Police had no leads Tuesday but were hoping the thieves would
try to sell the bears on the open market.
   ``If they were amateurs and then discovered the loot, our
chances of recovering of them are much better,'' Kelly said. ``But
if it turns out that they're in the (teddy bear) business, then it
will be much harder. They'll know where to sell them.''
   Idema is offering a cash reward for one teddy bear in
particular, a 1905 Steiff bear that is worth about $5,000.

<HEAD>Thatcher Arrives in Budapest on Her Tour of Eastern Europe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, pressing for close links between Eastern Europe's new
democracies and the West, arrived Tuesday in Hungary after a
rousing speech to the new Czechoslovak parliament.
   In Budapest, Mrs. Thatcher inspected a guard of honor lined up
in Kossuth Square before the ornate Parliament building. She dined
later at a city restaurant with Hungarian Prime Minister Jozsef
Antall.
   She received a standing ovation in the Czechoslovak Federal
Assembly after apologizing for the 1938 Munich treaty and
expressing remorse that the West did nothing when in 1968 Soviet
tanks crushed the ``Prague Spring.''
   She also told the assembly she would urge the 12-nation European
Community, which so far has offered only loose association to the
Eastern European democracies, to quickly offer them full
membership.
   Apologizing for Britain's appeasement of Adolf Hitler before
World War II, Mrs. Thatcher said the world was not making the same
mistake over Iraq's annexation of Kuwait, with Europe, the United
States and the Soviet Union acting in concert.
   ``In that new willingness to act together lies great hope for
future peace, particularly here in Europe,'' she said.
   ``We failed you in 1938 when a disastrous policy of appeasement
allowed Hitler to extinguish your independence,'' she said.
``Churchill was quick to repudiate the Munich agreement, but we
still remember it with shame.''
   The Munich treaty, signed by Britain and France, endorsed
Hitler's invasion of northern Czechoslovakia. A year later, he
invaded Poland to begin World War II.
   Turning to Alexander Dubcek, who led the 1968 reforms, Mrs.
Thatcher said, ``The pictures of that brave venture are etched in
our memory - and our inability to help remains a burden on the free
world's conscience.''
   Dubcek, now president of the newly elected Czechoslovak
Assembly, made no reference to 1968. But he said Mrs. Thatcher's
visit has ``put a full stop'' to the memories of Munich.
   Underlining the healing of pre-World War II wounds and the end
of decades of postwar communist rule, Mrs. Thatcher was present for
the renaming of a square in Prague after Winston Churchill. It was
formerly named for a Communist Party chief, Antonin Zapotcky.
   She proposed to the Czechoslovak parliament that a 35-nation
East-West summit adopt a universal standard of rights.
   ``If we can create a great area of democracy stretching from the
west coast of the United States right across to the Soviet Far
East, that would give us the best guarantee of all for security -
because democracies don't go to war with each other,'' the British
leader said.
   Before coming to Budapest, Mrs. Thatcher conferred with leaders
of the Slovak assembly in Bratislava, capital of Czechoslovakia's
Slovak Republic.

<HEAD>Arens Asks U.S. for Additional $1 Billion in Military Aid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens asked the United
States Tuesday for a special $1 billion grant in military aid to
defray the costs of an Israeli alert during the gulf crisis, Israel
radio reported.
   The grant would be in addition to $1.8 billion in annual U.S.
military aid to Israel, the radio said.
   The report said that Arens, who is in Washington, also asked
U.S. Defense Secretary Richard Cheney to increase Israel's yearly
aid allowance to $2.5 billion. No other details were given.
   Arens' requests appeared to be also in addition to Israel's
earlier appeals to lease more American fighter jets and other
military equipment to balance out a proposed $18 billion U.S. arms
package to Saudi Arabia.
   Israeli officials the past two days have spoken out strongly
against the sale to the Saudis, announced last week.
   Also Tuesday, Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai indicated he will
ask the United States to forgive Israel's $4.5 billion debt with
the United States if Washington erases Egypt's loans. Modai spoke
at a press conference.
   Modai argued that Egypt received increased U.S. aid because it
signed a U.S.-mediated peace accord with Israel in 1979. Egypt is
the only Arab nation to make peace with the Jewish state.
   ``Can you imagine that now the Egyptians' loans would be waived
and Israel would be stuck with its loans?'' Modai asked
rhetorically at a news conference.
   Modai said Egypt faces rising military expenses because it has
sent troops to assist in the Persian Gulf crisis. Israel, he said,
also faces rising costs because of repeated threats from Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein.
   Saddam's forces overran Kuwait on Aug. 2 and Baghdad later
annexed the emirate. The United Nations has condemned the invasion
and imposed economic sanctions on Iraq that also hurt several of
Iraq's Arab neighbors.
   Modai reiterated the government stance that Israel, while not
eager for bloodshed, would be unhappy with a negotiated gulf
solution that leaves Saddam in power.
   ``What will happen next - everybody will go back home, the
embargo will be stopped and Israel will have to face alone this
wild beast,'' Modai said.
   President Bush earlier this month recommended that Egypt's $6.7
billion debt with the United States be forgiven to help the Arab
state cover expenses incurred in the gulf crisis.
   The proposal already has run into opposition in the U.S.
Congress, where legislators have said such a move would invite
similar requests from Israel and other countries.
   Israel is America's largest foreign aid recipient, receiving,
besides the military aid, $1.2 billion in economic assistance.
Egypt is second, at $2.2 billion a year.

   George Hardy, a Depression-era union
organizer who died last week at age 79, was remembered for his
dedication and tough-mindedness.
   ``He spoke up for people without power,'' state Assembly Speaker
Willie Brown said at a memorial Monday, calling Hardy ``a labor
leader of the old school.''
   Hardy died Thursday at Children's Hospital. A union official in
Washington said he died of respiratory failure.
   Former Gov. Jerry Brown, Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy and many of
Hardy's friends in the labor movement attended the service at the
Mission Dolores Basilica.
   Hardy began his career as an organizer for Theater Janitors
Local 9 in San Francisco in 1932 and built the small regional union
into the 935,000-member Service Employees International Union.
   The union represents custodians, health care workers and public
employees. Hardy, a native of North Vancouver, British Colombia and
son of labor leader Charles Hardy, was elected international
president of the union in 1971. He retired in 1980.

   A second ``final'' offer and a second vote
headed off a strike by Philadelphia Orchestra musicians Tuesday,
hours before the first concert of the orchestra's 91st season.
   With the contract dispute settled, the musicians made plans to
go ahead with the performance.
   The musicians voted Monday night to reject what management said
was its final offer and prepared to picket the Academy of Music on
Tuesday. The old contract expired Monday.
   The union reported Monday's vote as 52-52. Tuesday's vote for
ratification was 58-48.
   But negotiators returned to the bargaining table and worked into
the early morning, and the union decided to call a second vote.
   ``It's the closest I've ever seen,'' John Hood, representative
of Local 77 of the American Federation of Musicians, said of the
second vote.
   He declined to release the vote totals or discuss how Tuesday's
offer differed from Monday's
   The union cited unhappiness with benefits involving pensions,
seniority, medical care and radio broadcasts in rejecting the first
offer.
   The union represents 105 musicians and four librarians.
   Joseph H. Kluger, orchestra executive director, said the new
contract provides 5 percent raises over the next three years in
base salaries, which are now $1,100 per week. No other terms were
revealed.
   The orchestra's last strike, in 1966, lasted eight weeks.

   A man described as ``head over heels'' in
love with a woman who dumped him should get his $15,000 engagement
ring back, a jury has ruled.
   Robert Bowersox also should get back $7,200 in cash he gave
Susanne Clair, the Douglas County District Court jurors said
Monday.
   ``Bob Bowersox was very taken by Susanne, this man sort of
tumbled head over heels with her,'' Bowersox's lawyer, Michael
Lazar, said of the two Omaha residents.
   ``His heart was on the table, folks,'' Lazer told the jury.
``Where was her heart?''
   But Ms. Clair's attorney, Warren Zweiback, said the nurse's aide
made it clear she never planned to marry Bowersox and that he knew
she was seeing another man.
   Bowersox, who is retired, also named Ms. Clair as a joint tenant
on his home.
   The couple declined to give their ages.
   She testified Monday that she returned the interest in the house
when she broke off their relationship in May 1989, but decided to
consult with her lawyer about the money and the 3.23 carat
pear-shaped diamond ring.
   Judge James Murphy told the jury during instructions that he
knew of no Nebraska case law on the issue.
   ``Apparently, lovers in Nebraska never have fights ... or ask
for the return of engagement rings, because our Supreme Court has
not had the burden of laying down a path for me to follow,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Barry Says Racial Tension Have Improved In Washington</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite tensions created by his drug and
perjury trial, racial relations are better in the nation's capital
than in ``Chicago, New York, lots of places,'' Mayor Marion Barry
said Tuesday.
   ``I think race relations in America are getting worse,'' Barry
told a mostly-white group of students at George Washington
University. ``My trial certainly brought to the fore some tensions
... but if I were taken from here, I guarantee you, a year from
now, you would still have racism.''
   In his most expansive comments on racism since he was convicted
of a cocaine possession charge last month, Barry stressed several
times during a 45-minute speech that the atmosphere surrounding his
legal drama was just another example of racism in America today.
   ``There are some people who would like to make Marion Barry
responsible for this - but I'm not in Chicago, New York, lots of
places where everyone thinks things are worse,'' the mayor said.
   But Barry, who was convicted of a misdemeanor cocaine possession
charge and acquitted of another last month, acknowledged that his
dwindling number of supporters now are mostly black.
   During the trial, his attorney complained repeatedly that Barry
was prosecuted because of his position. Jurors later said they felt
Barry was prosecuted because he is black.
   Barry did not make reference to recent criminal trials, like the
Central Park jogger case, that have been blamed for heightening
racial tensions. Instead, he listed only political examples:
   ``Take Andy Young,'' said Barry of the former civil rights
leader and mayor of Atlanta who recently lost a bid for Georgia's
Democratic gubernatorial nomination. ``Politically middle of the
road, no controversy ... yet he gets only 14 percent of the white
vote ... I believe race was a significant factor in that.''
   Barry concluded his formal remarks by issuing a call for racial
unity. This prompted a standing ovation from about two dozen black
students scattered throughout the auditorium where the speech took
place. About 200 whites sat quietly.
   ``There were more blacks who stood than whites,'' Barry said in
response to a later question. ``What that shows, I think, is that
we need to do some healing here at George Washington too.''
   In his first public address since learning that he would not be
tried on a dozen drug and perjury charges his jury could not
resolve, the mayor seemed relaxed, and even made some unusual
self-deprecating remarks.
   ``A lot of you have seen me from a distance,'' Barry said at the
beginning of his remarks. ``Primarily on television ... or
videotape.''
   That comment, which referred to the undercover FBI videotape
that showed him smoking crack cocaine on the night of his arrest,
drew laughs from the crowd.

   Soldiers fired tear gas into a crowd of
Mohawks and clashed with Indians at a reservation where soldiers
were searching Tuesday for weapons. Three Mohawks and five soldiers
were injured, authorities said.
   In one of the most violent clashes since the Mohawk standoff
began more than two months ago, soldiers used rifle butts to keep
back Indians protesting the raid on small Tekakwitha Island.
   One soldier was dragged to the ground, kicked and struck
repeatedly over the head with his helmet. That soldier and at least
four others were injured, according to military spokesman, Maj.
Rusty Bassarab.
   A 15-year-old girl and two other Indians were injured, said
Louis Montour, medical director of the nearby Kateri Memorial
Hospital, located on the Kahnawake reservation south of montreal.
   At least 75 people, including several Indian children, received
treatment for the tear gas, Montour said.
   Tuesday's clash began when about 200 Mohawks gathered on the
bridge to the Indian island in response to the army search. About
25 soldiers had gathered outside the Kateri hospital, near the
bridge.
   ``Tell them to get the hell out of here!'' one Mohawk man
shouted at the soldiers, many of whom wore gas masks.
   Kahnawake Chief Joe Norton tried to calm the crowd, which
instead grew more restless.
   ``Stay back, someone is going to get shot,'' Norton warned the
crowd, which surged forward, pelting soldiers with rocks. Punches
and shoves were exchanged as Mohawks battled with troops.
   The soldiers fired several volleys of machine-gunfire into the
air and then shot tear gas into the crowd, forcing the Indians back
across the bridge.
   But many of the gagging, coughing mob were unable to retreat
because Mohawks inadvertently blocked their path with a dump truck
they had brought in to blockade the bridge, witnesses said.
   Dozens of men, women and children leaped into the St. Lawrence
River to escape the stinging gas.
   ``We jumped into river and tried to wet our clothes to get it
off our skin and to hold wet cloth over our mouths and noses so we
wouldn't be overcome,'' one person said of the tear gas.
   Struggling to overcome the effects of the gas, the Mohawks
regrouped and made another charge as army helicopters buzzed back
and forth.
   ``They are invading our territory, it is an outright invasion of
our land,'' one Mohawk man said.
   Mohawk peacekeepers intervened to keep the crowd from the
soldiers.
   Bassarab said about 50 weapons were discovered in the raid,
including shotguns, handguns, hunting rifles and AK-47 assault
rifles.
   Another military spokeswoman, Capt. Yvon Desjardins, said eight
helicopters and about 100 troops participated in the search.
   The dispute came in the aftermath of plans by town officials in
Oka, 18 miles west of Montreal, to expand a golf course onto what
the Mohawks said was tribal land.
   Indians at Kahnawake and another Mohawk community, Kahnesatake,
near Oka, built barriers that blocked traffic on an Oka highway and
on the Mercier Bridge over the St. Lawrence, which connects
Montreal with its southern suburbs.
   The dispute became violent after Oka obtained a court order
demanding the Mohawk barricade be dismantled. Quebec provincial
police tried, and failed, on July 11 to enforce the court order.
   A police officer was shot and killed in the attempt and Mohawks
set up more barricades in Oka and around the Kahawake reservation
south of Montreal, blocking traffic and holding off the police and
army for more than six weeks.
   The Kahnawake barriers sparked an angry reaction from local
residents who saw their 20-minute commute to Montreal grow to two
hours. Several nights of protests and riots occurred during the
blockade, removed a month ago after a deal was reached between the
Indians and the Canadian Forces.
   On the Kahnesatake reservation, 50 Indian men, women and
children have been barricaded behind army barbed wire since Sept. 1
in an alcohol and drug treatment center.
   The army has cut off supplies and communications from about 12
journalists with those Mohawks.
   On Monday, the federal government was officially registered
owner of 92 acres of land near Oka that fueled the standoff. Ottawa
paid $2.78 million for the property.
   The government now can offer it to the Mohawks as part of a
package in a negotiated settlement. But Quebec has ruled the
Mohawks cannot receive the land as long as the standoff continues.

   Geffen Records no longer will distribute
albums from a controversial label whose artists include comedian
Andrew Dice Clay, the rap group Geto Boys and the hard-rock band
Slayer.
   In its announcement Monday, Geffen said it would stop making and
distributing albums from the Def American label because of
differences in ``creative philosophy.''
   The decision comes a month after Geffen decided not to
distribute a new album from Geto Boys because it felt the group
glamorized violence, racism and misogyny. Geffen also had declined
to affix its name to Clay's raunchy comedy album.
   ``We find ourselves increasingly at odds with Def American's
creative philosophy,'' Geffen said in a statement. ``A lot of
soul-searching went into this decision.''
   Founded by producer Rick Rubin in 1988, Def American's artists
include Danzig, The Black Crowes, Wolfsbane, Trouble and The Four
Horsemen.
   In a statement, Rubin said, ``I believe strongly in my artists,
and am willing to personally defend them.''
   Geffen Records was purchased earlier this year by MCA Inc. for
about $550 million in stock.

Exports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former security director of two U.S.
embassies in the Caribbean was arrested Tuesday on charges he
exported guns illegally, federal prosecutors said.
   George R. Mitchell, 42, of Baltimore, presently assigned to the
State Department in Washington, was indicted on eight federal
charges last week. After his arrest, he was freed on $50,000 bond
and will be arraigned Sept. 28.
   ``His position makes it a unique case,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney
Greg Welsh said. ``He was responsible for ensuring security both at
the embassy at Santo Domingo and the embassy at Antigua. He oversaw
private contractors, who are guards, and oversaw state department
personnel.''
   Welsh said Mitchell bought 37 guns in Baltimore and 25 guns in
Miami. Guns and ammunition were sold to a contractor providing
security at the embassies, as well as other buyers, Welsh said.
   The alleged crimes took place between August 1989 and April
1990, while Mitchell worked as a regional security officer at the
embassies in the Dominican Republic and Antigua, Welsh said.
   David Denny, a State Department spokesman, said Tuesday the
department had no comment. Denny said he did not know when Mitchell
had been transferred to his administrative position in Washington.
   The indictment charges Mitchell with exporting weapons, money
laundering, two counts of failing to declare cash brought into the
United States, two counts of improperly accepting a gratuity,
stealing more than 1,000 rounds of State Department ammunition in
Santo Domingo and lying to a Baltimore arms dealer.
   He could be sentenced to a maximum of 59 years in prison and
fined $3 million if convicted of all the charges.

<HEAD>Irish Republican Army Says it Shot Soldier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility
on Tuesday for shooting and wounding a British army sergeant
outside a recruiting office in London.
   The outlawed IRA, in a statement released to news media in
Dublin, Ireland, also claimed responsibility for three bombing
incidents.
   Sgt. Bernard Cox was hospitalized with three bullet wounds
following the attack Monday outside a recruiting office in the
North Finchley area of London.
   Witnesses said a man in a red crash helmet fired several shots
at Cox, who was sitting in a parked car. The gunman then jumped
onto the back of motorcycle and was driven away by an accomplice.
   The IRA statement emphasized that the attack was in the
parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   ``We take this opportunity to remind the Thatcher regime that
they have it in their power to grant peace to Ireland and to end
their futile conflict with our people,'' the statement said,
referring to the conflict in the British province of Northern
Ireland.
   Until Britain withdraws from Northern Ireland, the statement
said, ``attacks such as that at Finchley will continue.''
   The statement also asserted the IRA's responsibility for the
bombing of an army recruiting office in Derby Sept. 10. No one was
killed.
   The statement said IRA members had planted a bomb discovered
Aug. 13 at the home of Gen. Anthony Farrar Hockley, a former
commander of British land forces in Northern Ireland, and one that
fell off a car in London on Aug. 6.
   Neither bomb exploded.
   The bomb at Hockley's home was attached to a garden-hose reel.
   The IRA statement said the third bomb was planted on a car at
what was believed to be the London home of Sir Robert Armstrong, a
former Cabinet secretary. However, Armstrong no longer lived there.
   Instead, the bomb was planted on a car owned by Cherry Freeman,
formerly of San Diego. It fell off the car harmlessly as she drove
to work.
   On July 30, an IRA car bomb killed Conservative Party lawmaker
Ian Gow, a close friend of Mrs. Thatcher.
   The IRA, outlawed both in Britain and Ireland, says it aims to
unite Ireland under a socialist government.

   A two-story brick storefront collapsed onto
a busy downtown sidewalk Tuesday, crushing three people to death
and injuring eight others, authorities said.
   Among the 11 caught in the collapse were four police officers
who had been walking their beat, authorities said.
   The facade apparently was weighted down by metal signs and
security gates that had been anchored in the wall, said Fire
Commission Roger Ulshafer.
   The collapse occurred shortly before 2:30 p.m. between 9th and
10th streets on the south side of Market Street, one of the city's
main arteries.
   ``I looked up and saw a wall of bricks coming at me and all I
could do was close my eyes,'' said Neil Daniel, who was fixing his
car. ``I heard people start screaming.''
   ``I just turned around and the whole thing came tumbling down,''
said David Miller, a passerby.
   At least two people were trapped for a time, police said.
   Don Kligerman of the Department of Licenses and Inspections said
the facade apparently was improperly affixed to the building.
   ``The cumulative effect of that sign, the iron shutters and the
wall that was just free standing - it was really just a matter of
time until it fell over,'' Kligerman said. Further inspection could
lead to criminal charges, he said.
   Alom Kadosh, manager of the Stereo Sound store said he was
sitting in the front when the wall gave way.
   ``It happened so fast you couldn't see anything. But as soon as
it happened people went outside and everybody pitched in to help
pull off the bricks and the metal that covered the people that had
been trapped underneath,'' he said.
   All of the dead and injured were on the sidewalk. There were no
injuries inside the three different buildings that shared the brick
facade, authorities said.
   One woman died of a crushed chest and another of head injuries;
a man died of a crushed chest, according to a hospital spokeswoman.
   The three were dead on arrival at Thomas Jefferson University
Hospital, said spokeswoman Sue Bluemle.
   Five other people also were brought to the hospital, one
23-year-old man in serious condition with head and chest injuries,
she said. The four injured police officers were treated for minor
injuries and later released, she said.
   A woman was brought to Hahnemann University Hospital with leg
injuries, said Linda Clossey-Connelly, a hospital spokeswoman.
   The two who were pulled from the rubble were taken to other
hospitals, said Police Commisioner Willie Williams.
   Cynthia Bayete of the city Licenses and Inspections Department
said the businesses included an electronics store and a
check-cashing agency.
   ``We tried to make a run for it, and that's when the sign hit
the top of my head. And I fell to the ground.
   ``I turned around and looked. That's when I noticed my partner
was down,'' Davenport said. Davenport and others pulled Ms. Shears
free of the rubble.
   Officer Paris Davenport, 21, who joined the police force just
five weeks ago, said she was walking by the store with another
rookie officer when they heard a rumble and saw the store sign
falling down.
   ``We tried to make a run for it, and that's when the sign hit
the top of my head.''

   The teen-age son of a religious cult
leader was convicted Tuesday of helping his father kill a man and
his three children. Jurors acquitted him of the slaying of the
children's mother.
   Damon Lundgren, 19, listened to the verdicts with his head
bowed. He could be sentenced to death.
   The jury deliberated for about 11 hours over two days before
convicting Lundgren on four murder counts and four counts of
kidnapping in the deaths of Dennis Avery and his three children.
   He was acquitted of murder and kidnapping counts in the death of
Avery's wife, Cheryl.
   Prosecutor Joseph Gurley said he was satisfied with the
verdict.Lundgren's attorney, Albert Purola, declined comment. The
trial's penalty phase was scheduled to begin Monday.
   The convictions came the same day Lundgren's father, Jeffrey
Lundgren, 40, appeared at a sentencing hearing. He was convicted
last month on five murder and kidnapping counts.
   The same jury that convicted the elder Lundgren must decide
whether to recommend the death penalty. Other sentencing options
included life in prison without parole for 20 years, and life
without parole for 30 years.
   Damon Lundgren's mother, Alice, last month received five
consecutive life sentences for her conspiracy, complicity and
kidnapping convictions.
   The Averys were killed April 17, 1989. Each was been bound and
gagged, shot to death and dumped into a common grave under a barn
at a farm in Kirtland, 30 miles east of Cleveland.
   The elder Lundgren is a former lay minister of the Reorganized
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, in Kirtland. He was
defrocked in 1988 for inappropriate conduct and later formed his
own sect.

<TEXT>
   The Democratic-controlled House on Tuesday
slashed more than $2 billion from President Bush's budget request
for the Strategic Defense Initiative in fiscal 1991.
   Rejecting Republican arguments that SDI could thwart Iraq if it
develops the capability to unleash ballistic missiles, the House
voted 225-189 to make a deeper cut in the program than its Armed
Services Committee approved last month.
   In crafting a $283 billion defense bill, the panel adopted a
budget for SDI in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 of $2.9 billion.
The House agreed to reduce the program's budget by an additional
$600 million for a spending level of $2.3 billion.
   Bush has requested $4.7 billion for the anti-missile shield
commonly known as Star Wars.
   Twenty Republicans joined 205 Democrats in voting for the
measure while 39 Democrats and 150 Republicans voted against
passage.
   The House also:
   -Narrowly defeated, 216-200, an amendment to allow abortions at
military hospitals abroad. Currently a ban exists on using Defense
Department money to pay for abortions, except when the life of the
mother is in danger. The ban does not say whether military
personnel who pay for the procedure can use government facilities.
   ``It is simply to give our military personnel the same rights
that the rest of us have as long as they're willing to pay for
it,'' said Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif.
   But a longtime abortion opponent, Rep. Christopher Smith,
R-N.J., questioned his colleagues, ``Will the U.S. government
provide the facilities to destroy children at will?''
   The Senate, faced with a similar measure to its bill,
sidestepped the issue in their rush to adjourn for the summer
recess.
   -Approved a measure using $200 million in Defense Department
funds to create a program to assist workers, communities and
businesses hard hit by reductions in military spending. The vote
was 288-128.
   -Approved by voice vote a measure transferring $46 million that
was unused in fiscal 1990 for the MX nuclear missile, rail-garrison
program to environmental cleanup.
   -Turned back an attempt to eliminate $357,000 the Army will have
to reimburse North American Van Lines for property losses incurred
during the U.S. invasion of Panama last December.
   The government does not reimburse claimants who suffer losses or
damages in a combat situation, but Indiana lawmakers urged their
colleagues to help this ``Hoosier company.'' The reimbursement
stands based on a 228-189 vote.
   On SDI, the House approved the lowest level for the program
since 1985 when a spending level of $1.4 billion was adopted.
   ``We know that nations around the world are going to have the
capacity to target our cities. Mr. Hussein said five months ago `if
I had one missile I would hit New York,''' said Rep. Bob McEwen,
R-Ohio, referring to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Rep. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., said the United States should not be
``held hostage by some tinhorn dictator'' with an arsenal of
missiles.
   But Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., a member of the Armed Services
Committee, questioned why only a fraction of the administration's
request for SDI would go to ``research that would knock down or
intercept missiles.''
   Terrorist delivery of a nuclear weapon would likely come by
aircraft or a ship sailing into a U.S. harbor, Dellums said,
quoting testimony from U.S. military officials before Congress.
   ``Face the reality,'' Dellums urged his colleagues.
   The vote to reduce significantly spending levels for SDI
provides House members with a bargaining position in negotiations
with the Senate on the final defense bill.
   The House is expected to complete action on its version of the
defense bill on Wednesday, and talks between the House and Senate
will begin later this month.
   The Senate adopted a $289 billion defense budget for fiscal 1991
that trimmed about $1 billion from the SDI budget proposal.
   Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., argued that the SDI budget should
total about $3 billion. Traditionally House and Senate negotiators
have agreed to a number midway between the two budget totals.
   ``This figure, compromised with their figure, would give us $3
billion,'' Bennett said of the $2.3 billion total.
   The cut in the SDI program marked the second time in two years
that lawmakers have targeted the system. Last year, Congress
approved the first reduction in the program since former President
Reagan introduced it seven years ago. The fiscal 1990 budget level
for SDI was $3.8 billion.
   Earlier Tuesday, the House rejected, 338-83, an amendment by
Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif., to increase the SDI budget in the
House bill to $4.2 billion. It also turned aside, 285-136, an
attempt by Dellums and Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., to cut the
program to $1.5 billion. The vote was 285-136.
   A measure that would provide $3.6 billion for the program, the
amount approved by the Senate, failed, 273-141.
   The House also approved by voice vote a measure requiring the
Defense Department to submit two SDI budgets for fiscal 1992 - a
spending plan for six years and an alternative which keeps the
budget at fiscal 1991 levels for the next five years.
   Originally, Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., proposed a line-item for
the SDI program, a more stringent approach than that adopted by the
Senate. However, Spratt modified his measure in anticipation of the
House-Senate conference.

   A golfer died after being stung inside the
mouth by a bee that was in his beer bottle, authorities said.
   Officials said Elmer Kurzka, 60, apparently suffered an allergic
reaction to the sting, but were awaiting the results of toxicology
tests to be sure.
   Kurzka, of Arlington Heights northwest of Chicago, was stung
when he took a drink from the bottle and the bee entered his mouth,
said Du Page County Coroner Richard Ballinger.
   He was stung as his party prepared to tee off Saturday at the
Medinah Country Club, authorities said.
   His partners teed off and returned to their golf cart to find
Kurzka slumped over and having trouble breathing, said his wife,
Arlene.
   Kurzka's family said he had been stung numerous times in the
past but never had an adverse reaction. Ballinger said Saturday's
sting may have had a greater impact because the mouth is especially
sensitive.

   Remarks about plans for possible U.S. air
assaults on Iraq cost Gen. Michael J. Dugan his job as Air Force
chief of staff, but the incident was not the first time the
four-star general rankled his Pentagon bosses.
   Dugan, fired by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Monday, said in
a statement that he regretted ``any embarrassment'' his comments
caused the Bush administration. Cheney said Dugan, 53, would be
forced to retire, ending a 32-year Air Force career that included a
stint as commander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe.
   Several days after President Bush committed U.S. troops to
Operation Desert Shield on Aug. 7 to deter a possible Iraqi
invasion of Saudi Arabia, Dugan was quoted in a published report as
saying the United States had ruled out using chemical weapons or
battlefield nuclear arms if fighting broke out with Iraq.
   That comment caused a stir in the Pentagon, where military
authorities have been careful not to preclude any options in order
to complicate Baghdad's planning.

   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) - After four failures, NASA gave up
trying to launch the leaky space shuttle Columbia so that it can
concentrate on getting Discovery aloft in October before the
planets fall out of the proper alignment.
   NASA scrubbed the fourth attempt to launch Columbia about seven
hours before it was to lift off at 1:28 a.m. today after a buildup
of hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, was detected in the engine
compartment during fueling.
   A baffled Robert Crippen, shuttle director, said: ``I do not
understand it. Our plan is that we are going to understand it.''
   Columbia was to have lifted off with the $150 million Astro
observatory to study some of the hottest objects in the universe.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Federal researchers should be more open-minded
about unconventional treatments that show some potential to help
cancer patients, a four-year congressional study concludes.
   The study by the Office of Technology Assessment found that none
of the alternative methods it reviewed - including psychological,
nutritional and herbal remedies - was obviously or dramatically
effective.
   But the report also said these treatments have had little, if
any, scientific review, which leaves patients with no guidance if
they want to supplement or replace their conventional treatment.
   ``It's very hard to get information beyond promotional
brochures,'' said Roger C. Herdman, who supervised the report,
which was released Monday. ``There isn't a lot in the peer-reviewed
literature,'' where scientific findings are reported.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Methadone can break the opiate drug habit and
help stem the spread of AIDS, but many patients are being given
doses too low to be effective, according to a study released today.
   The report by the congressional Office of Technology Assessment
said methadone programs differ widely, including the doses of the
synthetic narcotic given to heroin users who can benefit from
methadone.
   An average daily dosage of 80 milligrams of methadone is
considered sufficient to wean most users from their heroin habit.
The lowest effective dose is believed to be around 60 milligrams,
the report said.
   However, a recent survey of 24 methadone programs found the
average daily dosages ranged from 21 to 67 milligrams, the report
said. Twenty-one of them gave an average daily dose of less than 60
milligrams.

   NEW ORLEANS (AP) - Six blacks are among a dozen candidates
scrambling to claim the House seat in Louisiana being vacated by
Rep. Lindy Boggs, the only white in Congress who represents a
district that is mostly black.
   Mrs. Boggs, 74, announced in July that she was stepping down for
personal reasons after more than 17 years in the House. The popular
Democratic congresswoman enjoyed strong support from New Orleans
voters in all age, ethnic and economic groups throughout her
tenure.
   But despite Mrs. Boggs' strong record on civil rights issues and
her support in the black community, blacks were growing anxious to
elect one of their own in the district, which has a 60 percent
black voting majority.
   Many believe 1990 may be the last year a black can be elected
from the district. Since New Orleans lost people in the 1980s,
district lines drawn after the 1990 census are expected to reduce
or eliminate the black majority.

   Elvira Elguera wants to wash her hair. Store
owner Ricardo Correa would love to sell her shampoo. But there'll
be no sale today. The shampoo has no price.
   ``Absurd!'' Miss Elguera declares as she stalks out of the shop.
   ``I don't know what my costs are,'' Correa tries to explain.
``It's better not to sell than to sell at a loss.''
   Peruvians have lived for years under the shelter of price
controls and subsidies. But when President Alberto Fujimori took
office in July and 11 days later announced sweeping reforms, Peru
took a dizzying leap into the economic unknown - a free-market
economy.
   Peruvians are baffled. Neither stores nor consumers seem to know
what things should cost.
   At first, prices soared: a pound of beans from 40 cents to $3, a
bottle of beer from 33 cents to $4. But when sales lagged, many
storeowners dropped their prices.
   Still, prices in one store can be five times higher than those
in a shop across the street. And, as in Correa's store, many
products simply have no price.
   ``Chaos!'' read a recent headline on the front page of a top
Lima daily.
   Even before the reforms, Peru's economy was headed for disaster.
Inflation averaged more than 3,000 percent a year and only one in
five workers had a steady job.
   The country's gross national product has shrunk 20 percent since
1988.
   Fujimori's reforms were aimed at halting rising prices by
drastically cutting consumption and closing a large fiscal deficit,
caused in great part by subsidies. Previous governments have
bridged the gap simply by printing more money.
   Prime Minister Juan Carlos Hurtado, who also is economy
minister, predicts the economy will stabilize by yearend.
   ``But the first 45 days of the plan will be tremendously
recessive,'' said Felipe Ortiz de Zevallos, an economist close to
the government.
   Government services such as telephone, water, light and fuel
cost 10 to 30 times more. This has pushed prices skyhigh throughout
the economy. Inflation in August was nearly 400 percent, highest in
Peru's history.
   Supermarkets are spilling over with unbought goods. Stores in
luxury shopping centers are boarded up. Many factories are closed
and others are preparing to shut.
   ``It's no longer a matter of lowering prices. People just don't
have money,'' said Carlos Chavez, whose men's clothing store is
full of sale signs. ``The only thing anyone thinks about is
eating.''
   Graciela Elias' shoe store hasn't sold anything in days. ``If
things continue as they are, we'll all go under,'' she said.
   A small-business association warns that thousands of companies
verge on bankruptcy.
   The measures will kill off all but the most efficient companies,
says Javier Silva Ruete, economy minister in a military government
from 1978 to 1980.
   ``What about the workers? And the violence? The only way to
impose this plan in Peru is with a dictatorship,'' he said in an
interview.
   The measures have left millions of Peruvians hungry. With wage
increases far below inflation, they simply can't afford sufficient
food.
   So far, there have been few violent protests. But just how long
poor Peruvians will wait for any improvement is unknown.
   The actions of wealthy industrialists may presage problems.
   After the new measures were announced, Peru's six main
pharmaceutical manufacturers jointly raised prices six to 10 times.
This put many life-saving medicines out of reach of all but the
rich.
   The prices have not dropped despite complaints even from
Fujimori.
   Silva Ruete says price-fixing by Peru's many monopolies and
oligopolies will continue until protectionist tariffs are reformed
to allow imports to compete. Fujimori has promised such reforms,
but so far there has been no change.
   Even some retailers have trouble coming to terms with the ways
of supply and demand.
   ``I don't understand where my customers went,'' said one
restaurateur, staring at trays of pasta that he's charging five
times more for than before the reforms.
   Across the street, a restaurant is packed. Prices there have
only doubled.
   Other retailers have adapted. Once-dour market venders now smile
more often at prospective customers. Waiters seem more solicitous.
And some private bus companies have begun offering candies to
attract riders.

<HEAD>IMF Perceived as Source of Resentment, Unrest in Caribbean</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANA HAYWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Efforts by the International
Monetary Fund to restructure the economies of struggling Third
World countries have led to widespread resentment and even domestic
upheaval in the Caribbean.
   Several of the 14 nations in the region have undertaken
belt-tightening programs designed and monitored by the IMF in
conjunction with the World Bank. Many of the countries complain
they are being forced to impose unpopular measures to qualify for
loans and foreign investment.
   ``Unless we are committed to a fund program, our debts will not
be rescheduled, we will not have access to the resources of
multilateral financial agencies . . . donors will not support us
and investors will tend to shy away from us,'' said President
Desmond Hoyte of Guyana.
   Guyana, a founding member of Caricom, Haiti, Jamaica, the
Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago have signed
agreements or begun talks with the IMF to implement programs of
currency devaluations, price hikes and wage freezes in hopes of
cutting inflation and promoting economic growth.
   Critics say the price of a blessing by the IMF is too high:
social unrest, radical politics and a sharp decline in living
standards.
   ``The IMF says, `Either you swallow that bitter pill or we won't
give you a cent,' '' said Paul Latourtue, a Haitian economist at
the University of Puerto Rico. ``But you can't give medicine that's
worse than the disease and you can't kill the patient to save it.''
   In its 1989 annual report, the IMF said its economic
surveillance programs are designed to help impoverished developing
nations ``to raise domestic savings, reduce inflation . . . and
foster growth.''
   With economic growth, creditors respond by rescheduling or
reducing debts and granting new loans, the report said. It added
the Washington-based institution is increasingly aware of the
social implications of economic reforms.
   Dennis Pantin, an economist at the West Indies University in
Trinidad, said the IMF only provides limited relief because it
doesn't take social factors into account.
   ``The IMF option is the most attractive in the narrow sense of
permitting debt rescheduling,'' said Pantin. ``But will today's
relief turn out to be tomorrow's burden?''
   In August, the Dominican Republic was rocked by violence after
President Joaquin Balaguer imposed belt-tightening measures
recommended by the IMF. At least 11 people were killed and 50 were
injured in protests against food and gasoline price hikes.
   Balaguer has said he will have to sign an IMF agreement to
qualify for new loans and meet payments on a $4.1 billion foreign
debt.
   ``Signing a new accord with the fund will mean total misery for
Dominicans,'' warns Francisco Antonio Santos, secretary of the
Central Worker's General, the country's largest labor union.
   Elsewhere in the Caribbean:
   -Trinidad and Tobago, one of the region's most stable
democracies, was plunged into turmoil in July by a coup attempt.
Moslem insurgents blamed the government for widespread poverty in
the once oil-rich nation off Venezuela. An IMF agreement to
reschedule the country's $2.4 billion foreign debt brought sharp
devaluations, wage freezes and cuts in social programs.
   - Guyana, which has had one of the steepest economic declines
among Western nations the past decade, signed a three-year IMF
accord in June 1989 to reschedule its $1.9 billion foreign debt.
The currency was devalued 70 percent and salaries for public
workers were slashed by half. But a year later, the economy of
Guyana shows little sign of improving.
   - Jamaica, with a foreign debt of $4.5 billion, 45 percent of
which is owed to the IMF, the World Bank and other lending
institutions, is the Caribbean's most indebted country. In January,
Prime Minister Michael Manley imposed harsh austerity measures,
including a 19.5-percent increase in basic food prices, as part of
a 15-month standby agreement with the IMF. Manley says Jamaica is
recovering because of a tourism boom but complains that virtually
all the island's earnings are used to pay its debt.
   - In Haiti, one of the world's poorest and most politically
volatile nations, a 50 percent currency devaluation based on IMF
recommendations was not publicly announced for fear of strife at a
time when the provisional government was trying to organize
elections. The government recently said it had a $31 million budget
deficit and was unable to collect sufficient taxes. Haiti's foreign
debt is relatively small, $16 million, because of a suspension of
foreign aid in retaliation for rights abuses.

<HEAD>Two Factors That Might Cushion The Fall of Stocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If it weren't for two unusual factors that
developed during the 1980s, the sharp decline in popular stock
market averages since midyear might have been sharper still.
   Not much attention is given to these factors, important as they
are. But were they absent, it is likely that the latest slump might
have seemed more like a collapse.
   - Factor one is the concentration of investments in big-cap
stocks.
   In the 1980s the big institutional investors concentrated their
funds more narrowly than ever in the stocks of the biggest
companies, those with the greatest capitalization and sales
reported in nine digits or more.
   This concentration might have had the effect of pushing up
prices of the big stocks which comprise the Dow Jones industrial
average and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock average. But it also
put a cushion beneath them.
   The latter effect results from the narrowing of institutional
investment parameters. Rather than moving funds to other stocks
when bad news hit, the institutions simply shifted their money from
one big-cap stock to another.
   Asa result, many of the largest companies fared better than
their smaller cousins. Small stocks indicators, for instance,
trailed those of big-cap stocks in 24 of the past 28 quarters.
   Why the concentration? In part, at least, because of the
tendency of many institutions to index portfolios to the popular
averages, thereby assuring themselves that they won't fare any
worse than the averages.
   Some critics regard this as a copout, contending that fund
managers should do more than ``average'' to earn their keep. Others
defend the practice as simple common sense. They argue that if an
institution's wealthy neighbor is buying huge blocks of certain
stock, it is smart to jump aboard for the ride.
   - Factor two is the shrinking supply of stocks.
   Yes, the supply of equities declined during the 1980s, and it
might still be declining. That was the direction through the first
quarter of this year.
   Shares available for trading decline for two major reasons:
Companies may buy back shares if funds are available and they feel
the shares are a bargain; and corporate mergers and acquisitions
often substitute debt for equity.
   Since 1983, more than $500 billion of U.S. equities have
disappeared from the stock market. That's the net amount - after
accounting for new stock issues brought onto the market. The
decline may continue for many months more.
   But merger mania may have run its course. The common denominator
of merged companies is a debt burden that becomes heavier during
economic downturns, such as now. Many companies have learned a
painful lesson.
   Conceivably, there could even be a reversal in the trend, with
privately held companies - companies that had been removed from the
market through leveraged buyouts - once again seeking to sell
shares to the public.
   Meanwhile, the narrowed universe of investment possibilities -
resulting from institutional indexing and from the substitution of
debt for equities - may be cushioning the decline in the popular
stock averages.

<HEAD>Some Doctors Ask: Are Physicians Too Greedy?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One doctor stopped eating in his hospital's dining
room when he finally tired of hearing other physicians brag about
their fat incomes, megabuck retirement funds and money, money,
money.
   Another remembers a colleague's shock at learning her salary.
How could she be happy when her pay - more than comfortable by most
Americans' standards - seemed so low?
   Money, it seems, is becoming an obsession for many in medicine.
Doctors long have made lucrative livings. But huge fees -
especially for surgery and high-tech procedures - have turned
medical pay into a subject of intense fascination, both for those
who pull down sky-high incomes and those who are jealous of the
doctors who do.
   ``Greediness is becoming more and more an issue,'' said Dr.
Michael V. Buenaflor of Northampton, Penn. ``Guys are a lot more
cynical and are turning to the American way of `Go for it.' ''
   But in the medical world, at least, money does not always buy
happiness. Many doctors say they are fed up with their profession.
They complain of second-guessing insurance companies, burdensome
paperwork, miserly Medicare fees, high malpractice rates and the
constant fear of being sued, among other things.
   Some argue that practicing medicine has become so unsatisfying
that many are bent on making sure the work is financially
rewarding, even if it's no longer fun.
   And rewarding it is. The latest statistics show that monetarily,
at least, doctors are doing very well indeed. Their pay is going up
far faster than almost everyone else's: Last year, according to a
survey, their net income rose 12.5 percent, almost triple the rate
of inflation.
   The survey, conducted among 6,484 doctors by the magazine
Medical Economics, found that the median net income of all U.S.
doctors rose almost $15,000 in 1989 to $133,000.
   Among other figures from the survey:
   - Annual incomes ranged from $87,000 for general practitioners
to $296,000 for cardiovascular surgeons.
   - One in five cardiovascular surgeons makes more than $600,000
annually.
   - The typical obstetrician's pay soared $36,000 last year, more
than any other specialty.
   - Only 6 percent of doctors make less than $50,000 a year.
   Many doctors contend they studied hard and put in long hours.
They deserve to make a good living, they say.
   ``When you consider that we work a 60-some hour week, that we
put 12 years of training in and we owe 50 grand when we start on
average, I don't think anybody is robbing the bank,'' said Dr.
Philip R. Alper, an internist in Burlingame, Calif.
   ``We don't make an excessive wage,'' he said. ``I don't have an
apology to make.''
   Some, in fact, fear they are falling behind.
   ``Nobody feels bad for physicians. We do make a good living,''
said Dr. Craig Czarsty, a family practitioner and doctor's son in
Oakville, Conn. ``But is my earning power the same as my father's
was 20 years ago? Probably not.''
   Specialists are particularly well off, but they contend they
deserve to make more than other people, including doctors in
general care. Their work is often tedious and exacting, they say,
and requires technical skills that take many years to perfect.
   Dr. Thomas Purdon of the University of Arizona Health Science
Center notes the special pressures faced by his colleagues in
obstetrics and gynecology, whose earnings the magazine survey pegs
at $194,000.
   Besides the many hours seeing women through their pregnancies,
labor and early motherhood, there is a real possibility that each
is a potential courtroom opponent.
   ``The public expects an absolutely perfect product and doesn't
want to recognize that there can be genetic problems and other
things that the obstetrician has no control over,'' said Purdon.
   ``If things don't turn out just A-OK, the first thing they do is
try to find a lawyer to sue him.''
   Yet an undercurrent of feeling remains - both inside and outside
the profession - that some doctors are just plain money hungry. A
survey conducted last year for the American Medical Association
found that two-thirds of Americans think doctors are too interested
in making money.
   Some of the criticism even comes from the well-paid specialties.
Dr. Peter S. Czachor of Kittery, Maine, notesthat when he retired
five years ago, he was charging $700 for complete obstetrical care.
Now doctors in his area are charging $2,000 for the same thing, and
their malpractice rates are the same.
   Those complaining loudest about physician avarice often are
doctors in the lower-paying primary care specialties.
   Buenaflor is the doctor who grew weary of dining room talk of
physicians' financial conquests. The final straw for him was an
ear, nose and throat specialist who said he'd finished the year
with an extra $160,000 that he couldn't figure out how to spend.
   Buenaflor is a family practitioner, traditionally the
lowest-paid medical specialty. (Last year, according to the
magazine survey, they netted an average $97,000.)
   Often, when these doctors on the front lines of medical care
talk about money, the conversation turns to specialists in more
technical fields.
   ``I'm going to be in my office 12 hours today,'' Buenaflor said.
``I will net less than a colorectal guy across town will do for a
20-minute colonoscopy,'' a routine diagnostic procedure.
   Dr. Lorilee Smith, a rheumatologist in Modesto, Calif., said she
believes the financial attitudes of many young doctors who set up
practice in the 1980s simply reflect the decade's fixation on
money. She was struck by a conversation with a young dermatologist
who moved into her building.
   ``After she had been here for a while, I told her what I made.
She was shocked. She said, `But you seem so happy.' Compared to
dermatologists, I'm making poverty-level wages, even though I make
great money,'' Smith said.
   Insurers have long paid high fees for technical procedures and
operations and much less for the hours that primary care doctors
spend figuring out which of these treatments their patients need.
But that will change, at least a little.
   Beginning in 1992, Medicare will reimburse doctors more for
their time managing and evaluating patients and less for technical
services and operations. Private insurance companies are expected
to make similar changes.
   This will raise the pay for family doctors and lower it for many
surgeons and radiologists. While the changes will narrow the
spread, it certainly will not eliminate it. Doctors who deliver
babies will still make considerably more than, say, the
pediatricians who care for them later. Is the pay of such
specialists as obstetricians fair?
   ``What's fair payment?'' asks Dr. John Graham, an official of
the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
   He offers a sports analogy to bolster his point:``Is Joe Montana
worth what he gets? I don't know.''

<HEAD>Despite Sanctions, South African Trade Grows With Black Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black African nations still
call for sanctions to punish South Africa for apartheid, but the
Pretoria government says every one takes part in rapidly growing
trade with the white-led country.
   Black Africa has consistently been one of South Africa's
harshest critics - and one of its steadiest partners, buying food,
mining equipment, guns and luxury goods such as designer clothes
and Mercedes-Benz cars to keep their economies afloat.
   President F.W. de Klerk's political reforms, combined with
rising economic desperation in much of the continent, have helped
South African exporters reach African markets heretofore closed.
   The Star newspaper of Johannesburg reported recently that South
African businesses now maintain warehouses in the Ivory Coast,
Togo, Zaire and Rwanda to export goods throughout the continent.
   The South African government also funds more than 100
development projects in 15 African countries, ranging from
cattle-raising in Equatorial Guinea to training midwives in the
Comoros Islands.
   ``Markets that were closed yesterday are open today,'' said
Martin Smith of the South African Foreign Trade Office, a private
consulting firm.
   Smith said his company meets up to 10 businessmen a week from
African countries who are seeking possible deals with South Africa.
   The 51-nation Organization of African Unity in July made its
annual call for sanctions against South Africa to protest
apartheid.
   But while Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, the OAU's outgoing
leader, presided over the meeting, businessmen from his country
were visiting South Africa in search of deals.
   Only 13 OAU members officially acknowledge trading with South
Africa, but in practice every member does, according to Rusty
Evans, deputy director general of the Department of Foreign
Affairs.
   ``Political obstacles aren't going to stop trade,'' said Sally
Gallagher, head of the consulting firm Business Development Africa.
``If someone has the products available, and someone has the money
to pay, then the goods will be sold.''
   South Africa's total trade with Africa exceeded $3 billion in
1987, according to Evans.
   The figure was less than 10 percent of the trade conducted that
year by South Africa, which has the most powerful and diversified
economy on the continent. Its leading trade partners are Western
Europe, the United States, Japan, Taiwan and other Asian nations.
   Southern African countries trade openly with South Africa and
say it would be economic suicide to cut business ties as a protest
against the apartheid system of racial segregation.
   But the South African government refuses to divulge specific
figures on its African trade, saying it does not want to embarrass
those who prefer to conduct business secretly.
   Several factors favor South Africa's effort to improve business,
diplomatic and cultural links with Africa:
   -De Klerk's reforms and stated intention of ending apartheid
have dramatically improved the country's international image,
though anti-apartheid groups have successfully lobbied for the
maintenance of virtually all existing sanctions.
   -Most African economies performed miserably during the 1980s and
no major improvements are forecast for the 1990s. South Africa is
the closest and cheapest source of goods, particularly manufactured
items.
   -There is widespread belief that Western investment and aid will
increasingly be diverted toward newly democratic Eastern Europe and
away from Africa. South Africa says it wants to help fill the gap,
though its resources are limited and its economy in mild recession.
   ``South Africa must persuade its neighbors by its actions that
it is not intent on their destruction,'' said Evans. ``We have to
persuade our neighbors that we are partners in the interest of
development.''
   The inability of African countries to pay in hard currency, and
not political barriers, is the biggest obstacle to increased trade,
Ms. Gallagher said. The trade has always been unbalanced. South
Africa imports only a fraction of what it sells to the rest of the
continent, she added.
   One unlikely example of growing business contacts is Angola. Two
private South African charter airlines have been delivering freight
there, and Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Dawie de Villiers
held exploratory trade talks recently with Angolan President Jose
Eduard dos Santos.
   Just two years ago, South African troops were fighting alongside
rebels battling dos Santos' Marxist government. But the two
countries signed a regional peace treaty in December 1988, and
Angola now looks to South Africa to help rebuild an economy
devastated by a 15-year-old civil war that continues.
   Since de Klerk came to power last year, he has traveled to five
African nations and met several more African leaders in March when
South Africa granted independence to Namibia, the territory it
ruled for 75 years.
   But open government-to-government contacts remain the exception.
South Afica has full diplomatic relations with only one African
nation, Malawi, and trade offices in at least eight countries, from
Botswana to Zimbabwe.

   Ali Hussain goes to school by
candlelight. He works all day punching holes in tin for toy
harmonicas, and daylight has faded before he gets to his books.
Electricity is in short supply.
   So are schools. Until six years ago Tikea Para, one of the
poorest areas in a city notorious for its slums, had no elementary
school.
   The predominantly Moslem residents took matters into their own
hands, chipping in manpower and a few rupees. Today, 400 children
go to a one-room school built, run and taught by people from the
neighborhood.
   Another 80 child laborers go to night class, not always winning
the struggle to stay awake. Ali, 8, says he earns $1.84 a week.
   ``This is a very backward area. These are poor people, and there
are too many child workers,'' said Sekander Khan, secretary of the
residents' committee.
   ``We can't stop child labor,'' Khan said. ``If we can't give
them an education, they will be like this all their lives.''
   The residents of Tikea Para have gone farther than most to
collectively help themselves in a city incapable of coping with its
population explosion.
   In the last 50 years, waves of migrants from Bangladesh and from
Indian villages have swollen Calcutta's population to 12 million.
An estimated 43 percent live in slums, or ``bustees.'' Uncounted
thousands camp on the street.
   Tikea Para is a bustee of about 100,000 people in Howrah, a
municipality across the Hooghly River from Calcutta's business
district.
   The slum dwellers were galvanized into community action when a
woman in the neighborhood was raped by a gang of hoodlums running
an illegal liquor store, Khan said. With police help, they cleaned
out the area, fenced off their bustee and took a hard look at their
children's future.
   The school began in 1984 with 20 children sitting on the dirt in
the neighborhood courtyard. They applied for municipal help but
were told other education projects had higher priority, Khan said.
   Now kids in tidy uniforms attend classes taught by young
unemployed university graduates from the neighborhood. They sit on
wooden benches, jostling papers on their laps because they have no
desks.
   The school operates two daytime shifts, with two grades sitting
in the same room each shift. A row of sewing machines occupies the
back.
   The courtyard has been taken over by a homemade merry-go-round
with wooden horses.
   Twice weekly a volunteer doctor from a nearby German-sponsored
clinic visits the bustee, receiving patients in a tiny back room of
the school.
   Tikea Para has about 70 small factories worked mostly by
children as young as 5. The most recent estimates say India had
16.6 million child laborers in 1986.
   The bustees of Calcutta and Howrah mark the decline of a
once-great city. Some call it the lowest form of urban life.
   Until 1912, Calcutta was the capital of India, the ``Second
City'' of the British empire after London. Its gracious Gothic
buildings, green lawns, wide boulevards and exclusive clubs
provided the backdrop for a lifestyle that symbolized the peak of
the colonial age.
   The Victorian-style buildings are eroding under an assault of
grime and neglect. Shantytowns have sprung up in the open spaces of
well-to-do areas.
   Howrah is a warren of cell-like shacks separated by open sewers.
But inside the shacks, the stone floors are spotlessly clean.
Residents bathe openly - partially dressed - under water pumps,
which kids usually turn into a game.
   Hunger is rife. Rag-draped people can be seen picking through
mounds of garbage for scraps of food, competing with mangy dogs,
crows and cattle.
   It was here that Mother Teresa, a frail Catholic nun, became
known as ``the saint of the gutters'' for giving dying homeless
people a bed, succor and dignity in their last hours.
   But the 800,000 people of Howrah show a surprising resilience
and acceptance in the face of crushing poverty and hunger.
   ``People are not unhappy here, especially the children,'' said
Helgo Meyer-Hamme, a West German doctor on a six-week volunteer
stint in the clinic.
   ``In Germany people are rich, live in nice houses and have
plenty to eat, but they are not happy. Here the children laugh all
the time. They can play with anything. Even a little piece of paper
can be a toy. We can learn from these people,'' said Meyer-Hamme.
   The doctors say most of their patients suffer from hunger- and
hygiene-related diseases: worms, tuberculosis, skin diseases and
respiratory illness. Leprosy is common.
   ``These people have nothing to look forward to,'' concluded
Meyer-Hamme's colleague, Bettina Borgmann. ``But the people

<HEAD>AMERICANS KILL AMERICANS: The 5{-Year Odyssey of Ken Burns</HEAD>

   Ken Burns sprinted up a Gettysburg slope in
the footsteps of Gen. Pickett's screaming Confederates and burst
into tears after climbing the hilltop wall that was the high-water
mark of the Confederacy.
   He mourned the deaths of ``friends'' ranging from Abraham
Lincoln to ordinary soldiers who dropped on battlefields 125 years
ago. And he was kept awake by the deafening sounds and vivid images
of Americans killing Americans.
   After 5{ years of work, the award-winning filmmaker is bringing
the sights, sounds, words and emotions of the Civil War into
millions of living rooms in a landmark public television
miniseries.
   ``We've made a film that has attempted to tell the whole story
and acknowledge that it is as dramatic as Hollywood or anyone could
dream up,'' Burns said. ``The Civil War,'' an 11-hour documentary,
will be broadcast on five nights beginning Sunday.
   The boyish-looking 37-year-old said emotions are the key to his
work and to seeing the war, in which 620,000 Americans died, in a
new light.
   ``We were constantly made aware of how poignant this story was,
how tragic it was,'' he said in his hilltop editing studio in
southwestern New Hampshire. ``The depth and profundity of that
emotion is what affected me more than anything else.''
   Burns tapped the emotions by peering into the innermost thoughts
of his subjects, from Presidents Lincoln and Jefferson Davis to
ordinary soldiers who died in the mud. Their diaries and letters to
loved ones are the script.
   ``We get to know two dozen people so intimately that we had to
take one of the final half hours of the film to consider their
fates,'' he said.
   ``To have met this man, Abraham Lincoln, and gotten to know him,
I consider one of the great honors of my life. To have met Robert
E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant and countless minor soldiers who could
write and speak and fight - and kill and die - has been the
greatest thing.''
   Burns traversed the country seeking information. For
authenticity, he filmed at battlefields on the anniversaries of the
fighting.
   At times he had to stop.
   ``I would dream so vividly about the battles, that it was too
much,'' he said.
   At Gettysburg, where Lee brought his army as far north as it
would get, and where George Pickett led his doomed charge, emotions
overcame him.
   ``I ran the last several hundred yards of Pickett's charge and
went up and over the wall and burst into tears with the sense of
this being the most important moment,'' he said.
   Burns hopes his series will strip away the ``gallant, bloodless
myth'' of the Civil War and show that television can entertain and
inform at the same time.
   His cinematography brings still photographs alive, dragging
viewers along as frightened soldiers feel their way forward looking
for the enemy. In Gettsyburg and Antietam battle scenes, his
zooming, cutting and panning move viewers through a kaleidoscope of
sights toward victory, death or panicked retreat.
   Burns studied and recorded sounds of the birds and insects the
soldiers would have heard, and just how it sounded when 200 cannons
fired at the same time.
   If the images are powerful, the words cut even more deeply.
Rather than use actors, as most documentary filmmakers do, Burns
uses only their voices.
   Here is part of a soldier's letter home after the second battle
of Bull Run: ``Sunday, a soldier in Company A died and was buried.
Everything went on as if nothing had happened, for death is so
common that little sentiment is wasted. It is not like death at
home.''
   History has long been a fascination for Burns in his filmmaking.
His first two documentaries, ``The Brooklyn Bridge'' (1981) and
``Statue of Liberty'' (1985), were both nominated for Academy
Awards. ``The Brooklyn Bridge'' and 1985's ``Huey Long'' won the
Eric Barnouw Prize for historical films.
   The American Film Festival awarded its Blue Ribbon to ``The
Statue of Liberty,'' ``Thomas Hart Benton'' (1988), ``The Brooklyn
Bridge'' and 1984's ``The Shakers: Hands to Work, Hearts to God.''
   Burns, who studied at Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., also
did the documentary ``The Congress.''
   The filmmaker is overwhelmed that PBS, for the first time, is
pitting a miniseries against the commercial networks' new fall
shows. The decision is more remarkable because television
essentially abandoned documentaries 20 years ago, he said.
   The commitment to a lengthy and complex prime-time documentary
is particularly rewarding when much of television has been reduced
to 30-second glimpses and rock videos.
   ``We have to first admit that television is where our children
are getting most of their information,'' he said. ``If you lament
this and merely abdicate it to those who promote its baser
instincts, we've lost the battle.''
   The battle metaphor is no accident.
   ``We are in the front lines attempting to remind people that
television can be used in an honorable, as well as entertaining and
nutritional way, and that's what this series is,'' Burns said.

   Robert Rhodes never knew his
great-grandfather, Elisha Hunt Rhodes, but listened intently when
his father told stories about their ancestor's Civil War exploits.
   This month, the rest of the country will hear about those
exploits in words the Rhode Island volunteer wrote from the
battlefields.
   Rhodes is one of the main characters of the PBS miniseries,
``The Civil War,'' which will be broadcast beginning Sunday.
   Filmmaker Ken Burns searched all over the country for photos and
accounts of the fighting, and found a gem not more than a mile from
his southwestern New Hampshire home. It was a collection of Rhodes'
letters and diary entries compiled by Robert Rhodes, a college
librarian, who had inherited them in the mid-1960s.
   ``Here in my own home town was this soldier who could epitomize
the northern grunt - the struggle of the ordinary man,'' Burns
said.
   Rhodes enlisted as a private at age 19 after the first shots at
Fort Sumter. He was mustered out in 1865 as a colonel, after
witnessing major battles and the surrender at Appomattox.
   He learned to be a soldier in Providence.
   ``We drilled all day and night,'' he wrote in 1861. ``Standing
before a long mirror, I put in many hours of weary work and soon
thought myself quite a soldier. I was elected first sergeant, much
to my surprise. Just what a first sergeant's duties might be, I had
no idea.''
   Rhodes said the film brings his great-grandfather to life.
   ``It put him more in the context of his times, which was good
for me,'' he said. ``I think we are the product of our times, and I
had to overcome that. Some of his remarks might be called racist
now.''
   He said his dad told stories of visiting Elisha as a youngster
and hearing stories about ``Johnny Mud,'' a Union soldier, whom
Rhodes believes was Elisha himself. ``They were bogged down in the
mud quite a lot.''
   Rhodes noted that his family tree would have stopped growing in
the Civil War if Elisha hadn't survived.
   ``It shows how one person can make quite a difference. Hundreds
of people's lives were affected, and that's just family members.
We'll never know who he may have shot, whose other families he may
have changed.''
   Rhodes said his ancestor made no direct mention of killing
anyone. ``He would just say, `We had lot of bad, dirty work to do
today and we did it.' ''
   When writing of hardship, he often said he didn't mind because
it was ``All for the Union,'' which is also the title of the
published collection.
   Elisha Hunt Rhodes returned to Providence after the war, where
he held a number of veterans' and community posts and was even
urged to run for governor. He was an Internal Revenue Service
official from 1875 to 1885 and the city's tax assessor in 1887.
   He also was a member of the school board and an official of the
Central Baptist Church, where there is a stained glass window in
his memory. He died in 1917 at age 75.

   When Annie Honeycutt became a foster mother to
two retarded brothers, she knew it would be an all-consuming job.
But she also knew it carried a bonus: freedom.
   When Ruth Bell turned her baking talents into a business, she
realized it would be a dawn-to-dusk, seven-day work week. But it,
too, had a long-term reward: an easier life.
   Two different paths, the same destination. These Detroit women
hunger for self-sufficiency, to be free of the stigma and shame of
welfare. They're among the thousands of people on public aid
nationwide experimenting with new ways to escape their
skin-of-the-teeth lives. Some are becoming entrepreneurs, others
students. A few even are opting for motherhood again.
   ``There's a welfare revolution going on,'' said Richard Nathan,
director of the Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State
University of New York. ``The question is, how far will it go?
Every state is doing something.''
   In Michigan, former welfare mothers are paid to be foster
mothers to disabled children. In Iowa, the once-unemployed now are
self-employed. In one Indiana county, ``mentors'' advise those on
the public dole. In Ohio, some teen parents earn money for
attending school. And in Wisconsin, some poor families lose money
if their kids don't.
   ``We're trying to change the signals and services and mind-set
... so that the welfare bureaucracy cares more and does more for
people to make it on their own, instead of just paying them
money,'' said Nathan. ``Do you give people fish or do you teach
them to fish? Now what we're trying to do is teach people to
fish.''
   Most of the ventures aren't traditional ``workfare'' programs
trading government welfare checks for jobs. Many emphasize
counseling and training. There's also a bigger push for education;
a California program makes reading and math instruction mandatory,
for example, for people on public aid found to lack those skills.
   Part of the impetus is the Family Support Act, a $3.3 billion
federal initiative passed in 1988 and touted as the biggest welfare
reform in 50 years. States are required to have programs in place
by October to prepare public aid recipients for work and help them
get jobs.
   About 3.8 million families - or about 11 million people,
two-thirds under the age of 18 - received $17.5 billion in Aid to
Families of Dependent Children benefits in 1989, experts say.
   Some already have made the transition from welfare check to
paycheck - in a most unusual way.
   In Michigan, 12 women who once lived off AFDC now earn $18,000
to $21,500 a year as foster mothers to hard-to-place disabled
children in the LIFE, or Living in Family Environments, program.
   ``It's a win-win situation,'' said program director Diane
Devine-Abdullah. ``It empowers them. It raises their self-esteem.
It gives them a meaning in life they didn't have before. They're
not only helping themselves, but they're helping a child.''
   That's the case for Annie Honeycutt, 34, and Fletcher, an
epileptic, retarded 6-year-old who already had lived in five
places. No one wanted the little boy, who was so angry he tried to
choke people, so aggressive he was tied down with restraints, and
so destructive he ripped apart furniture.
   ``When he first came, Fletcher was a monster,'' said Miss
Honeycutt. No more. He's calmer and happier with the woman he calls
``mama.'' He also has been united with his retarded-epileptic
brother, Rico, 3, who recently joined the family.
   As a foster mother, Miss Honeycutt has more responsibility, but
more independence, too.
   ``I never liked the sense of somebody giving you something for
nothing. I'm working for what I get,'' said the mother of four.
   Welfare-turned-foster mother Beverly Street knows the feeling,
raising two retarded teens. Kevin, 17, now reads and counts, quite
a feat considering that three years ago, he pulled the toilet from
the floor and knocked holes in the wall. Michelle, 15, can now feed
herself.
   Mrs. Street feels better about herself, noting that living off
``handouts'' sent the wrong signals to her two other children.
   ``How in the world can you as a parent tell your children,
`Finish your education .... I want you to make something out of
yourself' when you're out hustling food stamps?'' she asks. ``It's
a mockery.''
   Though this seemingly odd pairing has drawn inquiries from 27
states, it's not a likely large-scale solution for shrinking
welfare rolls.
   But another partnership that could encompass more people
recently began in Montgomery County, Ind. - a mentor system
matching welfare recipients with community members.
   Keith Weedman, who heads the county welfare department, said
some people get stuck on welfare because ``they don't see the
possibility of success.''
   ``By being engaged with people who see the world differently,
it's a stimulation,'' Weedman said. ``Each gets to be more tolerant
and accepting of the other.''
   Mentors range from factory workers to corporate executives and
Crawfordsville, Ind., Mayor Philip Michal, who says: ``So many
people on welfare lose hope. They need a friend. They need somebody
in the system to care. That's what this does.''
   Other new projects focus on teen parents, those at high risk of
becoming trapped in the welfare quagmire. One study found that at
any time, half the AFDC recipients were long-termers.
   In Ohio, LEAP - Learning, Earning and Parenting Program - offers
child care, transportation and $62 a month extra for teen-age
parents who return to or stay in school and have good attendance.
   ``They've become parents at a very young age,'' said Ellen
Seusy, who coordinates research for the program. ``Their earning
power is zero.''
   In Wisconsin, the controversial Learnfare program reduces family
benefits if their children play hooky.
   Though a judge in July partially suspended the program, citing
record-keeping errors, the state plans to make changes, believing
Learnfare offers hope for breaking the generational welfare cycle.
   Not so, said Dennis Fengier, whose family has been repeatedly
sanctioned.
   ``You're picking on poor people,'' he said. ``How are you
helping families by taking money from them?''
   Another welfare experiment has the jobless bring in money - by
creating their own jobs.
   Minnesota, Mississippi, Iowa, Michigan and Maryland have small
entrepreneur projects in which welfare recipients receive benefits
past the point where money earned from their businesses would make
them ineligible. The checks continue for a year after they reach
that point under a federal waiver that allows them to try to become
self-sufficient.
   Critics argue this approach is too costly, too limited and too
risky - starting a business is tough enough for those with jobs,
they say. But proponents argue that welfare, ironically, is a good
training school.
   ``Welfare recipients can be more enterprising than some people
in business, the way they have to wheel and deal their resources,''
said Sheila Das, of the Corporation for Enterprise Development,
coordinator of the programs.

   More than 100 businesses have been started - including
restaurants, repair and cleaning services, and caterers - and
dozens more are ready to go.
   Though aspiring entrepreneurs receive training, develop business
plans and sometimes are helped with loans, obstacles remain.
   When Ruth Bell tried to buy equipment for her Detroit bakery,
Chugga's, one store demanded full payment in advance; another
accused her of doing something illegal.
   ``What people think about the system burns me up,'' said Ms.
Bell, 42, who's too embarrassed to tell her three children she
receives welfare. ``They think we're all ignorant sons of guns.
They don't think we want to go anywhere or do anything.''
   And sometimes, discouragement comes from a surprising source.
   ``When they try to break out, they've got family and friends
saying, `You can't do this. What makes you think you can?' '' said
Cheri Huber, who runs the Iowa program.
   Experts say it's too early to gauge success or the impact on the
welfare rolls.
   ``Nobody has really tried many of these things before. We really
don't know how they're going to work,'' said Fred Doolittle of the
Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, which is evaluating
some programs. ``Very few people think it's going to eliminate the
public welfare system entirely.''
   But Ruth Bell is confident she'll make the break.
   Last year, she started by peddling her homemade bread to one
store. Now she helps cater luncheons and has more than 100
customers buying her pies and breads. She hopes to move soon from
her basement to a rented store.
   ``I have come a long way,'' she said. ``I'm on the road to
success.''

<HEAD>Wisconsin's Learnfare: Punishment or Promise for the Poor?

   It's an experiment in education that offers
promise for the poor - or punishment and pain.
   Learnfare, the only statewide program in the nation that ties
benefits of welfare families to their teens' school attendance, has
been praised, panned and put to a court test, leading to a partial
ban.
   Though Learnfare has a simple focus - keeping kids in school -
it stirs thorny debate about some hot-button issues: the role of
government, the responsibility of parents, the rights of the poor.
   Learnfare allows the state of Wisconsin to cut a family's
monthly Aid To Families Of Dependent Children check if a teen-ager
has more than two unexcused absences a month. A mother of two, for
instance, can lose $77 of her $517 monthly check, and sometimes
more.
   Learnfare's boosters, including Gov. Tommy Thompson, say this
cornerstone of Wisconsin's welfare reform package is the first step
toward cracking the cycle of poverty.
   ``The goal is to get these teen-agers back in school so they
won't need welfare in the future,'' said Diane Waller, director of
the Office of Welfare Reform. ``Without a high school education,
their chance to ever be self-supporting as adults is very
limited.''
   U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan has
praised the program's goals; his agency has approved Wisconsin's
request to expand it to younger children, but the state says there
will be no monetary penalties.
   The state has plenty of success stories: the truant who kicked
drugs, returned to school and graduated, teen mothers who write the
governor saying they now have a future for their children, hundreds
of dropouts in alternative programs, all courtesy of Learnfare.
   ``If we can stop this cycle when they are younger and give them
careers ... they won't have this terrible situation by the time
they're 36 and grandmothers still trying to pursue their
education,'' said Kathy Harrell-Patterson, head of an alternative
school for teen parents attending because of Learnfare.
   But opponents, including church and community groups and
parents, say Learnfare penalizes those living a meager
check-to-check existence.
   ``We have families who've been evicted because of this,'' said
Pat DeLessio, attorney for Legal Action of Wisconsin, which has
represented about 300 families sanctioned. ``They can't buy
clothing for their kids. They run out of food, they have to go to
food pantries.''
   Beyond that, some claim it just doesn't work.
   ``Some kids are big-headed about welfare. They say, `I don't
care if my mother gets cut off or not,' '' said Pamela Cooper, 17,
who contends her family's benefits were cut when she was
legitimately ill. ``Some people got kids who just won't listen.
They just won't go to school.''
   Others complain it smacks of discrimination.
   ``What are they doing to keep the children not on welfare in
school? Not a damn thing,'' said Dennis Fengier, whose family has
been repeatedly sanctioned because of what he says are
record-keeping errors.
   His wife, Geneal's, assessment? ``Learnfare - they don't learn
and it's not fair,'' she said.
   The Fengiers are among six Milwaukee families named as
plaintiffs in a class-action suit contending the Learnfare program
violates constitutional rights.
   In a July decision stemming from the suit, U.S. District Judge
Terence T. Evans ordered Learnfare suspended in Milwaukee County,
citing administrative errors. While its goals are worthy, he said,
welfare families ``should not be made homeless and hungry in the
name of social experimentation.''
   However, Evans also said he would lift the ban if changes were
made to improve the system monitoring absences in Milwaukee's
public schools, where the board has opposed the program.
   About 48 percent of 27,000 students ages 13 to 19 subject to
Learnfare live in Milwaukee County; some three-fourths of the
penalties have been imposed there.
   In June, a state audit found ``significant weaknesses'' in the
way Learnfare is run, citing paperwork errors causing some people
to be unfairly penalized.
   Some have branded Learnfare an administrative nightmare, but
state proponents insist it works well everywhere but in Milwaukee
County.
   ``The people can argue about how many and what percent ... (but)
Learnfare is getting kids back in school,'' said Miss Waller.
``There's no question about it.''

   ``We had to spread our resources over a number of institutions
as well, and couldn't just concentrate on Silverado,'' he added.
   When Silverado collapsed, the government sold the company's
solvent operations to First Nationwide Financial Corp. The
transaction required $1 billion in federal assistance.
   The former Silverado operations now are part of Columbia
Savings, the largest savings institution in Colorado, with more
than $5 billion in assets.

   ``Graffiti Bridge'' (Paisley Park) - Prince
   
   Prince is back. Let's haul out the adjectives - thrilling,
audacious, breathtaking, frustrating, aggravating. They all apply.
   In fact, they all apply to the first 17 songs on ``Graffiti
Bridge,'' setting this album's tone. ``Can't Stop This Feeling I
Got'' is a unique combination of '50s rock and '90s funk that
immediately indicates Prince is taking this project seriously. But
just when you expect the song to kick into overdrive comes an
annoying slow break ushered in with the prophetic words, ``Pardon
me for living, but this is my world. You can't make me change.''
   OK, we're willing to accept Prince on his own terms. He hears
things others don't, tries things others won't. When he succeeds,
it opens the endless possibilities of music that retread workers
such as MC Hammer can't even comprehend.
   That's part of what made ``Batman'' so disappointing for Prince
fans. It was paint-by-numbers funk, seemingly written in Prince's
sleep. The preceding ``Lovesexy'' may have been an ungodly mess,
but at least he was trying.
   ``Graffiti Bridge'' is a comeback because Prince indulges
himself while still worrying about public taste. And the exciting
moments simply outnumber the boring.
   Let's catalog some of the successes: ``Shake'' is an updated
trashy rocker from the '60s with a huge beat. ``Love Machine''
sizzles with Morris Day and Elisa's sexy dialogue. The stately
voice of Mavis Staples combines deliciously with Prince's
playfulness on ``Melody Cool.''
   ``Round and Round,'' sung by the youthful Tevin Campbell, is a
mesmerizing piece of funky reggae. ``Graffiti Bridge'' is a ballad
that compares favorably with ``Purple Rain.''
   Prince is usually a do-it-yourself musician, but he benefits
here from collaborations, particularly with his Minneapolis cohorts
in the Time, who are at the top of their game.
   The 68-minute disc is not without its disappointments. ``We Can
Funk,'' the fascinating collaboration with George Clinton, comes
out sounding better in theory than in practice. ``Elephants and
Flowers'' and ``Tick, Tick, Bang'' are unwelcome self-indulgences.
   Lyrically, there's hardly a memorable moment here - it's a
testament to Prince's musical ability that he can maintain interest
despite this handicap. The cosmic sex-and-spirituality dichotomy is
showing frays around the edges.
   And by the way, what the heck is ``Graffiti Bridge''? Guess
we'll have to wait for the movie.

   ``Sitting Pretty'' (New World) - John McGlinn, conductor
   
   John McGlinn has built a career out of resurrecting Broadway
musical comedy treasures of the past. The conductor and musical
archivist has had his greatest success with a complete recording of
``Show Boat,'' a monumental effort that will be the definitive
version of the musical for years to come.
   Now he has tackled ``Sitting Pretty,'' an almost unknown Jerome
Kern musical that the composer wrote in 1924, three years before
``Show Boat.'' Much of the score was missing for years, turning up
only eight years ago in a Secaucus, N.J., warehouse. And while
``Sitting Pretty'' isn't the groundbreaking masterpiece ``Show
Boat'' is, the musical deserves the attention and love McGlinn has
lavished on it.
   The musical's book by Guy Bolton is sweet, silly and
irresistible. So are the lyrics by P.G. Wodehouse. The plot
involves orphans (twins, no less), New Jersey millionaires,
ne'er-do-well nephews, show girls, con men and, of course, mixed-up
romances.
   And Kern's music is breathtakingly melodic, ranging from
touching romantic duets to toe-tapping comedy and dance songs. Much
of the score - and it's all here in more than 100 minutes of
playing time - is rooted in the conventions of the time. Still, you
can hear the composer trying to break out of the straitjacket of
1920s musical comedy.
   Instead of stringing together musical numbers from the show for
the overture, Kern composed what McGlinn calls ``a symphonic
poem.'' The overture is a musical train ride, complete with
whistle, bell and the sound of a steam engine coming to a halt. It
mirrors a train trip that takes place between the first and second
acts of the musical.
   Listen to the hero's lament, ``There Isn't One Girl,'' and you
can hear whispers of the blues that found their way into ``Show
Boat,'' or the simple yet affecting ``A Year from Today''
prefiguring such Kern standards as ``I've Told Every Little Star''
and ``The Last Time I Saw Paris.''
   The cast is headed by young, mostly unknown musical theater
performers including Judy Blazer, Davis Gaines, Paige O'Hara and
Jason Graae. They carry the majority of the score, and all are
superb singers.
   McGlinn and substantially the same cast performed ``Sitting
Pretty'' in concert last year at Carnegie Hall. This year, he did
Kern's ``The Cat and the Fiddle'' there. Let's hope it, too, makes
its way into the recording studio.

   ``Standard Time Vol. 3 - The Resolution of Romance'' (Columbia
Records) -Wynton Marsalis
   
   Wynton Marsalis blew with technical virtuosity as a 19-year-old
trumpet player making his recording debut in 1982. Form dominated
soul and it was unclear where the long road ahead would lead.
Through nearly a decade of playing and learning, Marsalis has
sacrificed none of his technical prowess while adding life to his
horn.
   The evolution of Marsalis' soul to date can be found on his
latest album, a collection of 20 standards. In Marsalis' earlier
playing, the smoky, 3 a.m. half light of the blues was an image.
Here it is real. Phrasing and tone suggest light and shadow as
Marsalis explores the heart of the music.
   It is no accident that this exploration is so successful given
that Marsalis' father, Ellis, is on piano to help guide his
talented son. Marsalis the elder is at the heart of this record,
tutoring his young master in the fine art of subtlety. the lesson
seems well learned.

   ``Texas Tornados'' (Reprise) - Texas Tornados
   
   African rhythms are terrific and the Brazilian beat is burning
hot, but you could travel the world over and never find a more
enticing sound than the one blowing in through America's own back
door, the Texas-Mexico border.
   And no one does Tex-Mex better than the Texas Tornados, a
genuine supergroup featuring Freddy Fender, Flaco Jimenez, Augie
Meyers and Doug Sahm.
   Hearing Fender's plaintive tremolo on the hearbreak ballad, ``If
That's What You're Thinking,'' is just one of the many pleasures of
this 10-song collection.
   Another is the bouncy Vox organ of Augie Meyers, whose stylings
on the instrument were the signature of the Sir Douglas Quintet, a
1960s band founded by Meyers and Sahm that produced the hits
``She's About a Mover'' and ``Mendocino.''
   Accordionist Flaco Jimenez is perhaps the world's best-known
player of the Mexican polka and waltz music called conjunto.
   Sahm, whose broad musical vocabulary encompasses all these
genres, stands solidly at the center of the Texas Tornados. He
plays a variety of instruments on the record and sings lead on more
than half the songs.
   Sahm never hits a false note, whether he's whooping it up on the
Cajun-flavored ``Who Were You Thinking Of''or playing the part of
an unrequited lover on ``She Never Spoke Spanish to Me.''
   ``Texas Tornados'' is one of those rare albums without as bad
song. It's being played mostly on country stations but with a
little wider exposure these gracefully aging sons of the Southwest
could cut a broad path into the mainstream.

   Vienna at the turn of the century was boiling in artistic fever.
Among the artists to emerge from that cauldron of creativity was
Egon Schiele.
   Harry N. Abrams will publish the definitive book on Schiele's
work and life in November. To coincide with the publication of
``Egon Schiele: The Complete Works'' ($195), The Galerie St.
Etienne in New York will mount a special exhibit to celebrate the
100th anniversary of the Austrian expressionist.
   With Gustav Klimt and Oskar Kokoschka, Schiele was among the
most influential artists of that time. He was 16 when he was
admitted to Vienna's Academy of Fine Arts, and by 1910 had already
developed his style. But he enraged a moralistic public with his
frank treatment of sexual themes.
   He died in 1918, a victim of the Spanish Influenza.
   The handsome Abrams book contains 94 full color prints and 107
duotone plates.
   Here is a list of exhibits and shows at some museums and
galleries in the United States.

<HEAD>The Artists: In the Year of His Death - Paul Klee</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HANNS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paul Klee, mortally ill, knew that the end was near.
But he was determined to finish his work.
   ``Durchhalten'' (keep going), he penciled under a drawing he did
three months before his death. An exclamation mark was added. The
drawing, portraying a contorted figure, reflects the tenacious mood
of the artist who had a prodigious ability to translate emotions
into pictorial language.
   Fifty years after the genius of abstract art succumbed, at least
seven European museums have mounted commemorative exhibitions. But
the show at the Kunstmuseum of his native Bern is likely to remain
unique.
   It took the organizers two years to assemble virtually all the
work Klee completed in the last few months before he died June 29,
1940, aged 60.
   He had been on what he once termed ``the tragic path'' since
1936 when he learned that he was suffering from scleroderma, a
rare, often fatal disease affecting the mucuous membranes.
   That path was marked by an intensified pace in the work of the
artist who was never idle. In a career spanning four decades, he
produced some 9,000 paintings, waterolors and drawings.
   The pace appeared to be fastest in 1940, the year of his death.
Attesting to it is a catalog meticulously kept by Klee himself in
typical thoroughness. It lists a total of 366 works finished in 4{
months. On view at Bern are 328.
   Many of the works are from the collections of his son, Felix, an
art historian who died three days before the exhibition opened Aug.
17, and from the Bern-based Paul-Klee-Foundation. The exhibition
runs through Nov. 4.
   But almost 100 exhibits were assembled from museums and private
collectors in the United States, Japan and Europe. Klee Foundation
curator Josef Helfenstein, who organized the show, said only 10
works could not be sent to Bern, being too fragile.
   One drawing was destroyed in a fire 15 years ago in the United
States and 27 could not be located despite intensive research,
according to Helfenstein.
   ``Plenty of sheets of drawings have pointed the way and said:
The time has come,'' Klee wrote early in 1940, sensing the nearness
of death. The title of one, ``Tod und Feuer'' (``Death and Fire''),
seems to have foreshadowed his cremation. ``Sick Man in a Boat,''
and ``Rowing Desperately'' are others suggesting death was the
dominating theme.
   But Helfenstein says the show disproves the widely held belief
that the thought of approaching death is reflected throughout his
final oeuvre.
   ``In many aspects, this latest period is representative for his
entire work,'' he said.
   To stress his point, Helfenstein notes that the last number on
Klee's personal list is ``Yellow House II,'' a ``rather mysterious
than tragic motif, cheerfully colored.''
   Helfenstein says it is hardly a coincidence that Klee, whose
symbolism is a main feature of many of his compositions, completed
exactly 366 works. The curator notes that 1940 was a leap year with
366 days.
   ``Klee must have supposed that in a figurative sense this was
his `leap year,' too,'' he wrote in the catalog.
   On May 11, 1940 Klee left Bern for a sanitarium in southern
Switzerland where his condition suddenly worsened. He never again
touched his brushes and crayons.
   ``I cannot be grasped in this world,'' said a passage in his
diary a few months before he died. ``For I am as much at home with
the dead as with those beings who are not yet born.'' These words
were later inscribed on the stone marking his grave at Bern's
Schosshalde cemetary.
   There is no record of it, but the final weeks of his life must
have been also depressing because of the German blitzkrieg defeat
of France.
   Klee, of German-Swiss parentage, had left his father's country
in disgust when the Nazis took over in 1933. The new leadership of
Germany, where he had spent most of his career and where he had
risen to international fame, declared his works ``degenerate.''
   Although most sources list him as a Swiss, Swiss authorities
never granted Klee citizenship.

<HEAD>Music Makers: The Popularity of Getting Older</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>

   One of the most popular songs on college
radio stations these days is a partly fond, partly unsentimental
look back at youth from a man who's feeling his age.
   The ironic success of ``We Don't Do That Anymore'' hasn't
slipped by David Slutes, co-author of the song and singer in the
Arizona-based rock band Sidewinders. Slutes is 27 years old.
   ``If anything, they shouldn't relate to that at all,'' he said.
``All the classic rock stations should be playing it for the older
people.''
   ``We Don't Do That Anymore'' is a hard rocking take on aging, a
subject rock 'n' roll hasn't treated with particular grace in the
past, both in song and in real life.
   It's a tale of a group of college friends who stay up all night
and drink wine, with ``nothing but dreams and things on our mind.''
Advance a few years later to preoccupations with jobs and rent, and
it's clear from the song's title those days are past for Slutes and
his friends.
   ``You look back and say, `My God, I miss those times,' '' he
said. ``But you also look back and say, `Thank God I'm not doing
those same things.' ''
   The tempered idealism of the song is an apt metaphor for the
Sidewinders' own career. Slutes, Richard Hopkins, Mark Perrodin and
Bruce Halper realized a dream when RCA signed them to a major-label
contract. But they're finding there's a lot of hard work - and no
guarantees - involved in becoming a rock 'n' roll success story.
   That work recently involved networking at the New Music Seminar
in New York City and their fourth appearance at a converted
hamburger stand turned rock club in Albany, thousands of miles from
home.
   Veterans of the punk rock scene in Tucson, Ariz., the
Sidewinders are trying to make it as a hard-edged, traditional rock
band - disdaining the heavy metal scene and the studied weirdness
of many college radio favorites. Musician magazine described them
as an ``unholy cross between R.E.M. and Husker Du.''
   Sidewinders aren't doing their own growing up in the obscurity
that characterizes many similar bands.
   The band put out its first album by itself and expected several
other years of recording on independent labels before anyone in the
``big leagues'' noticed them, Slutes said. Instead, RCA signed them
after seeing the band at a showcase in Austin, Texas.
   ``Auntie Ramos' Pool Hall,'' named after an place near where the
band rehearses back home, is the Sidewinders' second RCA album.
   ``We're growing as songwriters and players with every album,''
Slutes said. ``Lyrically, for me, I'm writing a lot better. I'm
learning how to explain things better to music and Mark is writing
better music.''
   The brutally brief ``Sara's Not Sober'' is about impatience
directed toward a drunken friend. Slutes, charitably, describes
``Sara'' as a composite of several people he knows.
   With ``We Don't Do That Anymore,'' Slutes said he had to walk
the fine line between making the song maudlin or a joke.
   ``It comes about as close to any song we've done to life,'' he
said. ``As you get older, your priorities change. It's something I
live with everyday.''
   The band produced ``Auntie Ramos' Pool Hall'' themselves,
although RCA recently pressured them to hire a manager and make the
next record with an outside producer, Slutes said.
   ``The company said, `Look, you guys, you have to grow up. You're
not an indie (independent) band anymore,' '' he said.
   But Slutes appears to have picked up on the type of work bands
have to do offstage to get ahead. He quickly recites the call
letters of local radio stations that have been playing ``We Don't
Do That Anymore.'' He was following a recent interview with dinner
hosted by an Albany college radio station.
   ``You look at radio and it seems it's gone from being
song-oriented to being sound-oriented, having a certain production
quality,'' he said. ``You don't seem to hear real songs anymore and
we're a real song-oriented band.
   ``That sounds kind of preachy, but there are a lot of great
bands out there that have good songs that you don't hear on the
radio because they don't have the right sound. We haven't had a
producer yet (so) we haven't gotten our radio ear yet, or whatever
you need.''
   While Hopkins jokes about Sidewinders' plans for ``world
domination,'' the band seems content with gradual career
advancement.
   ``We're really happy, especially at the college level, with how
we've been received,'' Slutes said. ``We seem to have gotten a
decent fan base now that so when we go to a town we have a certain
number of people waiting to see us.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Dani Shapiro Comes of Age</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Author Dani Shapiro does not keep a box for old
rejection slips; there are none to fill it with. Her first
published novel was the first one she ever wrote.
   It's not supposed to happen that way. She should have attempted
to write six or seven novels, supported herself by moonlighting as
a bank clerk or editing at a publishing house, and finally made it
around age 40.
   Instead, Shapiro is just 25 and wrote ``Playing With Fire''
(Doubleday, $17.95) in a small room at the Dakota in Manhattan, one
of the city's most exclusive apartment houses, whose residents
include Yoko Ono, Carly Simon and Lauren Bacall.
   ``You knock on wood a lot,'' Shapiro said. ``But in some ways I
feel like I've paid my dues. I have written for many, many years.
I've just never tried to get anything published. That's one of the
great ironies.''
   ``Playing With Fire,'' a coming-of-age story set in the East,
quickly became a mystery for Doubleday. Press releases state the
publishers couldn't decide whether the novel was commercial or
literary.
   Shapiro worked on it like any other fiction writer, starting
with characters based on real people and gradually using more of
her imagination, but the packaging is as slick as any fashion
magazine.
   A model's seductive stare and bare leg are visible on the front,
and a carefully coiffed Shapiro is on the back, her blond hair
layered rather than straight and brushed back as she appears in
person.
   ``What do you think? Is that picture going to end up in Spy
Magazine or what?'' laughed Shapiro, looking at a copy of the book.
   ``I think that is part of selling the book,'' she added.
``There's a funny story with this book. There's a picture on the
spine of the book that shows the model's whole body. That was
originally the front. I was really grateful they changed it because
she looked like me.
   ``In some circles `commercial' can mean derogatory. In other
circles it can mean it sells a lot of books. I just knew that if
this got published, I would be the happiest girl in the world
forever.''
   Shapiro's real life is a mix of the literary and the commercial
- or commercials. Born in New York City and raised in an Orthodox
Jewish household, she had tried short stories in high school, but
was too scared to let anyone see them. She attended Sarah Lawrence
College hoping to develop her writing skills, but became an actress
instead.
   ``I met this friend of my family, who was a commercial
producer,'' she recalled. ``I did start doing commercials - the
kind of things you need to do to get in the actor's union. I kind
of fell into it. The years I was acting I thought that I wanted to
do serious work but I didn't have a facility.''
   Shapiro's credits included spots for candy bars, soda, a board
game and gasoline - not exactly the Iowa Writers Workshop. Kirk
Douglas may be able to write novels, but Shapiro insists acting is
the worst kind of preparation for being an author.
   ``They're opposites,'' she said. ``A friend of mine said that
writers write because they don't want to be heard saying what they
say. The method of acting I was studying had everything to do with
the person, with their history, plotting out their life.
   ``It's very autobiographical, while as a writer you try to get
further away from your own life.''
   Shapiro got back to writing and eventually showed some of her
work to an agent, Esther Newberg, who got her a deal at Doubleday.
The book was sold in February 1989 (film rights have been acquired
by a pair of independent producers), and Shapiro revied it over
the summer.
   ``Playing With Fire'' is narrated by Lucy Greenberg, the only
child of a prominent New York City family. She attends Smith
College and rooms with the beautiful and mysterious Carolyn Ward.
They soon begin a passionate affair which becomes even more
complicated when Lucy starts seeing Carolyn's wealthy stepfather.
   Shapiro changed the novel considerably with each draft, taking
characters once based on herself and friends and adding details she
would have never wished or imagined otherwise.
   ``Doubleday never said do this or do that. We would sit at
breakfast and talk for hours about the characters and I'd go home
and work on them,'' she explained. ``We'd have all these corporate
breakfasts and talk about Lucy and Carolyn, and people would be
really interested.''
   ``Playing With Fire'' was a coming-of-age experience for Shapiro
as well. Writing the book aged her five years, she says, and
publicizing it added five more. She's now at work on a second
novel, quickly gathering material for a box that will someday be
filled with evidence of dues even the luckiest writer has to pay.

   The new book ``Ain't Nothin' as Sweet as My
Baby'' contains a picture of country singer Jett Williams at the
age of 2 playing a toy guitar.
   It is a telling photograph, because Jett grew up to discover
that she was the daughter of country music legend Hank Williams.
   ``That fascinated me when I knew that Hank Williams was my
father, to think back on how I always played guitar and always
sang,'' she says. ``It made me feel really good, as if it was
something he left me.''
   Jett Williams tells her story in the book, how she was adopted
first by Hank Williams' mother and after her death by a Mobile,
Ala., couple named Deupree who tell her that Hank might be her
father but there's no proof and nothing can be done.
   Jett launches a search and learns that she's the daughter of
Bobbie Jett and Hank Williams. In the last five years, she has been
through many courts. There's big money involved but Jett says that
finding her roots, not money, was paramount. Her legal name is
Cathy Deupree Adkinson. Her stage name combines the last names of
her parents.
   Don Helms and Jerry Rivers, longtime members of Hank Williams'
band, the Drifting Cowboys, have embraced her. So far this year,
Jett and the Drifting Cowboys Band have played some 40 dates. ``I
really love it,'' she says of her traditional country show. ``I'm
having the time of my life.''
   The hardest thing in her search, Jett said, was discovering that
her mother had died. ``I had put so much stock in that she was
going to be able to answer all my questions.'' It was also
difficult to accept that her mother voluntarily gave her up.
   The best thing about Williams' search, she says, was meeting
Keith Adkinson, the Washington lawyer who took her case and is now
her second husband. He calls her B.J. because documents that he
found read ``in re: the matter of Baby Jett.'' He manages her
career and practices law, with ``Jett law'' taking the largest
share of his time.
   ``Also wonderful was finding the pre-birth contract and finding
out that Hank Williams was my father and that he wanted me,'' she
said in an interview. ``It was a wonderful emotional cushion for me
to land on.''
   On Oct. 15, 1952, Bobbie Jett and Hank Williams signed a
three-page, notarized document which said that he would give her a
plane ticket to California within a month after she gave birth and
he would pay hospital and doctor bills and support their child, who
would live with his mother for two years then live with him.
   ``I think it tells a lot about my father as a human being. He
loved me before I was born; he took me sight unseen. To me it's the
greatest compliment a father could give a child.'' Hank Williams
died Jan. 1, 1953, five days before his daughter was born.
   In 1985, Hank Williams Jr. sued in Alabama and Jett Williams
sued in federal court in New York over Williams' estate. In 1987,
the lower court in Alabama said Hank Williams Jr. was sole heir to
the estate of Hank Williams, who died without a will, and Jett
Williams was named a child of Hank Williams. In 1989, the Supreme
Court of Alabama ruled that Jett had been the victim of fraud, by
people who tried to keep her from finding out her parentage, and
said she can share in the estate.
   Still to come is a trial in New York regarding copywright of
Williams' songs. Will his two children and second wife share song
royalties equally or will the widow get half and the children get a
quarter each and from what year shall the daughter start collecting
her share?
   Among Williams' some 150 songs are ``Your Cheatin' Heart,''
``Hey, Good Lookin','' ``Jambalaya,'' ``Settin' the Woods on Fire''
and ``I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,'' his daughter's favorite.
   Yet to be decided, in Alabama, is how Jett Williams shares in
Hank Williams' estate.
   She and Hank Williams Jr. haven't met, but she said she would
like them to meet and talk.
   She wrote the book, published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, ``to
tell the story of the search, frustrations, fighting, losing,
winning, setting the record straight in the court system. To me,
that's the story. That's why I ended the book before I knew about
the money.''
   This spring, Jett went to the Country Music Museum in Nashville
and had Williams' guitar handed to her to play. ``I'd seen a tie of
his and one of his suits behind glass but it was the only thing of
his I'd ever touched.'' She was thrilled.
   In 1949, Hank Williams wrote ``There's Nothin' as Sweet as My
Baby.'' His daughter heard a radio transcription of him introducing
it as ``Ain't Nothin' as Sweet as My Baby.'' She used that as her
book title.
   The lyric includes the description, ``Golden hair and big blue
eyes.''
   ``Of all the songs he wrote, that seemed to be custom made for
me,'' Jett said. ``He wrote it years before I was born but I like
to think he might have daydreamed what it would be like if he had a
little baby girl.''

   Sex, love and marriage in Ethiopia. A Hungarian
woman who claims she converses with the dead. These are the
subjects of two of the 34 films premiering in the 1990 Margaret
Mead Film Festival.
   In all, 45 documentary movies will be presented during the
festival, which will take place at the American Museum of Natural
History, Sept. 24-27.
   ``The Women Who Smile,'' is a story of three generations of
Ethiopian women who discuss their feelings about love, sex and
marriage. The women represent the viewpoints of the Hamar, a people
in the remote, southwestern part of Ethiopia.
   The thin line between religious ecstacy and supernatural
experince is explored in ``The Seer of the Dead.'' It captures the
relationship between an elderly Hungarian woman, who claims she can
communicate with the dead, and the people in her community.

<NOTE>Eds: Updates with morning Nikkei, comments</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices plummeted on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
Tuesday morning, with the key Nikkei Stock Average falling 3.82
percent. The dollar was slightly higher against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei lost 932.53 points to move to 23,433.04 by
the close of morning trading. The index fell 531.865 points, or
2.13 percent, on Monday.
   The dollar was changing hands at 137.50 yen after opening at
137.17 yen, up 0.17 yen from Monday's finish. It had risen against
the yen in New York, ending at 136.55 yen compared to late Friday's
136.45. Morning trades in Tokyo ranged between 136.95 and 137.60.
   Meanwhile, the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese
government bonds was 8.640 percent, up from Friday's 8.565-percent
finish. The price stood at 80.89 points, down from Friday's
81.89-point closing price.
   Stock traders said high oil prices, rising interest rates and
pessimism over the situation in the Middle East discouraged
investors.
   Benchmark Brent Sea crude was valued at $33.50 a barrel in Tokyo
early Tuesday afternoon, up from $32.30 in New York on Monday.
   Falling prices on the bond market also pushed the market down,
they said.
   ``Prices fell across the board,'' said Yoshiro Inoue, an analyst
for Nomura Securities.
   The market also was awaiting for the release of the U.S.
consumer Price Index later Tuesday in Washington, he said.
   Trading was ``very light'' according to Kazuyuki Suzuki, a
trader for Daiwa Securities.
   ``Everything is the same as yesterday,'' when investors were
sidelined because of pessimism about the delcining market, he said.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's higher opening in Tokyo
followed its overnight gain in New York.
   ``The dollar is recovering its strength in the last couple of
days as investors started buying it back to make technical
adjustment by reducing their yen holdings,'' said Masato Hayashi, a
Bank of Tokyo dealer.
   He said U.S. Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford's comments
Monday discouraged some investors from buying the dollar. Mulford
said the dollar's recent declines would contribute to further
improvements in the U.S. merchandise trade deficit. Market players
took the comment to mean the U.S. would allow the dollar to fall,
he said.
   Hayashi said the dollar would remain in a 136.50-137.50 yen
range because there are selling and buying interests on both ends
of the range.

   DETROIT (AP) - General Motors Corp. is free to close plants but
will spend $4.2 billion to protect the income of employees affected
by cutbacks under its new labor agreement, a newspaper said today.
   The contract contains $4.2 billion in income guarantees,
eliminates weak plant-closing prohibitions from the previous
agreement and increases wages by 3 percent the first year, the
Detroit Free Press reported in today's editions.
   The agreement also provides for lump-sum payments equal to 3
percent of wages in the second and third years and increases
monthly pensions from $1,500 to $1,800 for workers who retire after
30 years, according to union and company officials who spoke to the
newspaper on condition of anonymity.

   Although the level of inventories reported Monday by the
Commerce Department is not recessionary, economists said surging
stockpiles are a clear danger sign that could signal manufacturing
cutbacks and greater unemployment.

   IBM and Microsoft Corp. say their relationship
has never been better as they sought to quiet talk that a rift was
developing between the computer hardware and software giants.
   Millions of personal computer users worldwide use machines
designed to IBM and Microsoft standards.
   ``IBM today reaffirmed its relatioship with Microsoft,'' the
computer company said Monday.
   Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said in a separate statement:
``Microsoft and IBM have played a key role in the development of
the PC industry and we will continue to cooperate to provide the
best operating system solutions to our customers.''
   Talk that IBM and Microsoft were at odds has peppered trade
journals in recent weeks.
   In an interview, Steve Ballmer, a Microsoft vice president,
disputed reports that the two companies had stopped working
together on new versions of operating systems, the base layer of
software that controls a computer's internal functions.
   But the companies announced they would divide responsibility for
developing new versions of two operating systems: OS-2, used on
IBM's Personal System-2 computers, and DOS, the operating system
for IBM's older personal computers and many brands of
IBM-compatible machines.
   Previously, each company worked separately on developing new
versions of OS-2 and DOS. Under the new arrangement, IBM will have
primary responsibility for developing OS-2, while Microsoft will
have the primary role in improving DOS. William Bluestein, an
analyst at Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., interpreted
that as an admission the two companies had gone separate ways.
   ``It basically is a form of divorce,'' he said. ``What really is
being fought over is who controls the industry, who controls the
direction.''
   By controling the development of operating systems and the
timing of their release, Microsoft could influence sales of IBM
computers, while IBM could affect sales of the applications
software Microsoft makes, analysts say.
   But Aaron Goldberg, an analyst at International Data Corp., said
he believed the explanation by IBM and Microsoft that they only
wanted to improve the development process for operating systems.
   ``They have agreed to split the load a little better,'' he said.
``Microsoft doesn't have all the resources to chase every product.
   ``This to me is a perfect case in where our comptuer industry
trade press is trying to find a fire where there is no smoke,'' he
added.
   As part of the new arrangement, Microsoft will have the main
responsibility for developing a version of OS-2 for computers whose
central processor uses a technology called reduced-instruction-set
computing, or RISC, which primarily is used in powerful desktop
workstations. Bluestein called that a bone IBM threw Microsoft.
   OS-2 was jointly announced by IBM and Microsoft in 1987 as their
answer to the ease-of-use of Apple Computer Inc.'s popular
Macintosh.
   But the operating system has been slow to catch on, in part
because it can't be used with applications software, such as
spreadsheets, designed for DOS. It also is limited because it must
be used on machines that have a certain memory capacity - more than
many older computers have.
   Additionally, Microsoft has been heavily promoting a software
product called Windows that provides much of the Macintosh's
features on a DOS-equipped machine.
   IBM also said Monday that it would license the Windows software
from Microsoft, however IBM did not say whether it would provide
the feature with their machines.
   Last fall, to dispel similar rumors of a rift, IBM and Microsoft
jointly announced their strategy for OS-2 and Windows. They said
Windows was aimed at less-powerful computers using DOS, and OS-2
was designed for machines with greater memory.
   But IBM has said it is developing a version of OS-2 for older
computers that have less memory.
   That decision caused some industry-watchers to question its
support of Windows. Analysts also say Windows poses a threat to
OS-2, since it gies owners of older machines less incentive to
upgrade to models that could use OS-2.

   Winning a lottery jackpot such as Florida's
$106.5 million bonanza drawing can be a sweet dream, but for the
average person the temptations and mysteries of new-found wealth
can become a nightmare.
   The advice from most financial experts after all the hoopla dies
down is simple: take things real slow.
   ``Preserving your capital is the first thing you've got to do.
You'll have plenty of time to invest it,'' David McLaughlin, a
financial adviser with Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottseville,
Va., said Monday. ``You must make sure your money is safe and
earning something.''
   Such is the ``problem'' for at least half a dozen Florida
Lottery players. Six tickets matched the winning numbers drawn on
Saturday in the Florida Lottery estimated at $106.5 million - a
state record and the second largest in U.S. history behind
Pennsylvania's $115 million jackpot last year. Each Florida ticket
is worth about $17.75 million over 20 years, or $887,500 annually
before taxes.
   Many investment counselors suggest that for the first couple of
years lottery winners - or anyone with a sudden windfall, for that
matter - keep a portion of their loot in liquid assets, such as
certificates of deposit or Treasury bills, until they can figure
out what they want to do with it.
   Some banks, such as Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, even offer
special accounts for clients who suddenly have $1 million or more
and need a place to park it.
   The rest can go into longer-term bonds, including tax-free
municipal issues, or growth stocks, experts say.
   For McLaughlin, the mix would be divided equally among Treasury
bills, Treasury notes or bonds, and stocks for the first few years.
Of course, a very small portion may be splurged, he said.
   Charles Clough, the chief investment strategist for Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co., would recommend that 45 percent of the winnings go
into intermediate- and long-term bonds, 10- to 15 percent in cash
or 90-day T-bills, and 40- to 45 percent in stocks.
   ``But stay away from stocks (of companies) that depend on
cyclical consumer spending,'' he warned.
   State lottery officials often don't provide financial advice to
winners, except to sometimes explain tax liabilities and urge
winners to hire a good accountant. Those who fail to take such
advice run the risk of falling prey to peddlers of bogus
investments.
   But among the biggest problems most lottery recipients will face
is having to sift through all the solicitations from various
financial brokers.
   ``They're going to be getting a lot of calls,'' said McLaughlin,
who recommends winners get an unlisted telephone number for
starters.
   ``There will be a lot of pressure,'' added Michael Naste, an
independent financial planner from Deland, Fla., and a $2.5 million
lottery winner himself. ``If they're not careful, they can easily
overextend themselves.''
   Such was the case of a young New York beautician who won $7
million about five years ago, said Naste, who says he has 73
lottery winners as clients.
   Before the young woman came to him for help, he said, she had
made several poor investments like putting her money into strip
shopping centers.
   ``She's half a million (dollars) in debt right now . . . and
she'll barely come out ahead,'' even after receiving all her
lottery payments, Naste said. ``She had quit her job and now she's
gone back to work.''
   A middle-aged construction worker who won $4 million in the New
York lottery four years ago also ran into probolems, said Naste.
   After receiving a check for around $148,000 - the first of his
20 annual after-tax installments - he quit his $38,000-a-year job,
threw a party and put $10,000 down on each of 10 new Cadillacs, he
said.
   But in the next eight months, six of the luxury cars were
repossessed and the man had to borrow $200,000 to hold him over
between lottery checks, Naste said.
   Most big-lottery winners, though, are fairly conservative,
financial advisers and state lottery officials say.
   Michigan, for example, found in a 1987 survey that nearly three
quarters of its $1 million-plus lottery winners had sought expert
financial advice.
   The majority used their first check to pay bills or splurge on a
new home or car, but later, most made long-term investments, saved
for retirement, or established trust funds, the survey showed.

<HEAD>Labor Department Checking on Banks' Handling of Proxies for Pension
Funds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Labor Department says it is examining
whether banks that hold securities for pension funds are getting
proxy ballots to the funds' managers in a timely fashion.
   Assistant Labor Secretary David George Ball said the department
also will examine whether the proxies - absentee ballots for
shareholders - are being delivered to the person responsible at a
fund for voting them.
   Shareholders are entitled to a say in the running of a company
through their vote at annual shareholders meetings. Proxy ballots
are sent to those not attending a meeting in person.
   ``Like political democracy, for corporate democracy to work
well, persons entitled to vote need to be able to get relevant
information in a timely fashion and to receive their ballots in
time to cast them,'' Ball told a meeting in Washington of the
United Shareholders Association on Monday.
   The association is a grassroots organization founded by Texas
oilman T. Boone Pickens in 1986 to fight for shareholder rights.
The group has sponsored numerous proposals at the annual meetings
of large corporations.
   Ball said the Labor Department's office of enforcement will be
contacting a small sampling of bank trustees to see how they handle
proxies for pension funds.
   He added that if past experience is any indicator, ``I would
expect that the fact that we are making these inquiries will lead
to an internal review of procedures by bank trustees to assure
compliance with the law.''
   After his speech, Ball explained that the Labor Department was
focusing on banks ``because banks are the custodians of the large
(pension) plans.''
   He said department statistics show that 90 percent of the
assets, representing 85 percent of plan participants, are
concentrated in just 6 percent of the nation's pension plans.
   Ball said the review, to be completed by year's end, will screen
200 or 300 banks.
   ``It'll be the big ones, the ones that are likely to have the
custodianship of pension plans,'' he said.
   The Labor Department maintains that those who invest the money
of pension funds have an obligation to manage the assets so they
retain or increase in value. That includes carefully voting their
proxies.
   ``Therefore a fiduciary would be derelict in his or her duty if
he or she did not vote plan shares on matters which might affect
the value of shares,'' Ball said in his speech.

   Federal regulators are avoiding a potentially
chaotic standoff by compromising in a dispute over the most
important soundness standard for financial institutions.
   Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke announced Monday
that he was backing down in his contentious feud with other banking
agencies over how much capital banks must hold as a cushion against
losses.
   Clarke had pushed for a slightly more lenient standard. If he
had stuck to his position, the nation's banks would have faced the
confusing prospect of having different standards apply to different
institutions, depending on which agency served as primary
regulator.
   The comptroller oversees about 4,000 nationally chartered banks,
including the nation's largest institutions, while the FDIC
supervises about 8,000 state-chartered banks.
   The Federal Reserve regulates some of the state and federal
banks, already overseen by the other two agencies, if the
institutions are members of its system.
   Capital, representing the investment of a banks' owners, is the
basic yardstick for measuring a financial institution's soundness.
The more capital a bank has, the more losses it can absorb without
failing and requiring money from the federal deposit insurance
fund.
   Meanwhile, the House on Monday put aside its normal order of
business and by voice vote adopted legislation removing the legal
ceiling on insurance premiums levied on banks and savings
institutions by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   The Senate is expected to begin considering the measure next
week. Congressional leaders, the Bush administration and the FDIC
are supporting passage before Congress adjourns early next month.
   Starting next year, banks will have to pass a two-part capital
test. On a risk-adjusted basis, they will be required to hold
capital equivalent to 7.25 percent of their asses. After 1992,
that will rise to 8 percent.
   The risk-adjusted capital offers institutions a break for
holding low-risk investments such as home mortgages and government
securities. Regulators have agreed on that part for months.
   However, they have been feuding over the so-called ``leverage
ratio'' which represents the smallest amount of capital a bank may
hold no matter how safe its investments.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman had been pushing for a 4.5
percent minimum, while Clarke wanted 3 percent. Seidman argued that
Clarke's proposal would lower capital for 90 percent of the nations
banks and would permit the industry's capital to shrink by $8
billion.
   He said that was the wrong move in the wake of the savings and
loan crisis. One of the causes of that debacle was lax standards
which allowed S&amp;L owners to operate their institutions with little
of their own money at risk.
   Clarke had argued that setting the leverage ratio too high would
negate the beneficial effects of the risk-based standard designed
to nudge banks into safer assets.
   The Federal Reserve, in a compromise adopted last month, said
only the strongest banks - about one in five - would be permitted a
3 percent minimum. Others would have a minimum ranging between 4
percent and 5 percent. The FDIC is scheduled to pass the compromise
at a board meeting today. The new guideline would become effective
Jan. 1.
   Meanwhile, the Office of Thrift Supervision, which regulates
savings and loans, announced it would tighten its rules to conform
with the new commercial bank guidelines. Currently, it's ``core''
capital requirement, analogous to the leverage ratio, is 3 percent.

   Two credit rating services have lowered their
assessments of Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s ability to repay its debt.
   Jerry Buldak, spokesman for Chicago-based Sears, said Monday
that the giant retailer doesn't comment on ratings adjustments.
   In New York, Moody's Investors Service lowered Sears' long-term
debt rating from A1 to A2, while Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. of Chicago
downgraded the company's senior debt from AA-minus to A-Plus.
   Also lowered were some debt ratings for Sears subsidiaries,
including Discover Credit Corp., Sears Roebuck Acceptance Corp.,
Sears Overseas Finance and Allstate Insurance Co.
   ``The rating actions are based upon Moody's opinion that
improvement within the intensely competitive merchandising sector
has not been nor will be achieved as quickly as originally
anticipated,'' Moody's said in a statement Monday.
   Duff &amp; Phelps said its rating changes will affect about $28
billion dollars of debt securities.
   ``The reason for the downgrades is the continued subpar
performance of the merchandising group,'' Duff &amp; Phelps said
Monday.
   In July, Sears reported a 39 percent drop in second-quarter
profits, blaming high insurance payouts and a decline in retailing
income.

   NCR Corp. said today it would become the first
computer maker to offer an entire product line, from laptop
computers to giant mainframes, based on Intel Corp. microprocessors
and standardized software.
   Using the same type of microprocessors, the ``chips'' that are
the brains of computers, would make the entire line compatible,
meaning a laptop computer could get at information stored on a
mainframe.
   The computer lines of most major makers are divided between
proprietary, or company-specific, processing systems and ``open''
systems such as those based on Intel chips. The differences mean
various computers sold by the same company often are incompatible.
   The industry has moved toward open systems in recent years as
companies want to use the same applications software, such as
spreadsheets or word processing programs, on all computers no
matter what the brand. In addition, computer users increasingly
want to connect machines in networks, which can be troublesome with
incompatible models.
   NCR, though not a major player in general-purpose computers,
could reap major rewards from its new direction, said analysts.
   ``You can't write these guys off as a non-factor anymore,'' said
Don Young of the investment firm Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. ``I
think it's a pretty bold move on their part.''
   NCR said it eventually would provide computers in seven
``levels,'' or performance and size ranges. Today it announced six
machines in three of those levels, including workstations and
``servers,'' powerful computers that link networks of less-powerful
machines. The models released today cost $10,000 to $800,000.
   The higher-end models of the new line derive their power by
linking multiple Intel microprocessors in a technique called
parallel processing. NCR says it will power the giant mainframes at
the top of the line by hooking together thousands of the same chips
that run tiny laptop computers.
   Dayton, Ohio-based NCR long has specialized in computers for
banks and retail stores, and is a major maker of cash registers and
automated teller machines. In recent years it has enjoyed success
with a line of personal computers built to industry standards using
Intel chips.
   It now plans to phase out its old computers and use those
standards and Intel chips on its entire product line.
   NCR would become the first company to sell high-end mainframe
computers based on open systems, analysts said. The models would be
NCR's entry into the market for extremely powerful computers.
   The new strategy ``will potentially open up their rather narrow
market into a broad market,'' said Rick Martin, an analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``The question is, can they be one
of the major players? The answer is you just don't know.''
   In coming weeks, NCR also is expected to announce software and
networking systems that will allow the new computer line to be
connected throughout a company, Martin said.
   NCR's new direction would be another boon to Intel, the Santa
Clara, Calif., chip company that is enjoying phenomenal success.
Its chips are so popular with computer makers that it can't make
enough to satisfy demand.
   But the news could be troubling to Motorola Inc., which makes
the chips used in some NCR computers. NCR's move signals the
increasing dominanace of Intel's chips in computers - already,
Intel chips are the dominant processors in desktop machines.
   ``Motorola's microcomputer business is headed for some tough
times,'' Young said.
   NCR sells less than $5 billion worth of computers a year, out of
a global market of $200 billion, he said. By comparison,
International Business Machines Corp., the industry leader, has
sales of about $60 billion.
   Earlier this month IBM announced a new generation of mainframe
computers based on a proprietary standard. IBM also said it plans
to provide systems that would allow the mainframe computer to
coordinate corporate-wide computing networks.
   Next month, Unisys Corp., the No. 3 computer maker, also is
expected to announce products for connecting computers throughout a
company.

   Stocks slumped this morning as the market
reacted negatively to the latest inflation and trade numbers.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was off 13.12 at
2,554.21 by 10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losing issues outdistanced advances on the New York Stock
Exchange by a wide margin of about 10 to 3 with 732 down, 221 up
and 439 unchanged.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks
declined 0.79 to 173.83.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 19.02 million
shares after the first 30 minutes of trading.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 0.89
to 320.82.
   Two government reports released before trading opened added to
the anxiety over the economy's condition.
   The Labor Department said consumer price inflation rose 0.8
percent in August, pushed up by the energy price spiral set in
motion by Iraq's Aug. 2 seizure of Kuwait.
   The gain in the Consumer Price Index was double the 0.4 percent
rise in July and the largest since January, when a severe cold snap
pushed costs up 1.1 percent.
   In a separate report, the Commerce Department said the U.S.
merchandise trade deficit jumped a dramatic 75 percent to $9.33
billion in July.
   Market analysts said stocks could take their cue today from the
direction oil prices take. Prices of crude moved sharply higher in
European trading overnight.
   Among the active blue chips, International Business Machines
rose ~ to 106, General Electric fell &rsqb; to 58|, and Philip Morris
sagged &lsqb; to 44}.
   On Monday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had
fallen 55.44 points last week, rose 3.22 to 2,567.33.
   But declining issues outnumbered advances by about 9 to 8 in
nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 681 up, 768 down and
508 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 110.60 million
shares, against 133.39 million in the previous session.
   The NYSE's composite index gained 0.47 to 174.62.
   The American Stock Exchange's market value index closed at
321.71, up 0.26.

   Democratic congressional leaders today blamed
the Bush administration's demand to slash the capital gains tax for
the breakdown of budget talks just two weeks from the start of the
new fiscal year.
   But President Bush, asked if capital gains was the stumbling
block, told reporters, ``not as far as I'm concerned.'' Bush said
he talked with his budget negotiators today and ``we're going back.
We're staying with it. I can't really predict what's going to
happen.''
   ``The problem is the insistence of the administration to reduce
the capital gains tax,'' House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.,
told reporters.
   ``The real difficulty and the major obstable to agreement is the
tax issue,'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
``The rest would come together quickly.''
   Participants said they still hoped to try to work out a budget
deal, but it was unclear how quickly they could do so.
Congressional leaders planned to meet in the Capitol today with top
administration officials to discuss the impasse.
   ``It's not total gridlock,'' said Foley.
   Asked whether he was optimistic, Bush said everybody involved
``agrees we've come quite a ways, but it's not done by a long
shot.''
   Republicans insisted that there were other important differences
between the two sides over spending cuts, but Democrats insisted
these were relatively minor. Democrats harped on their oft-repeated
theme that a capital gains tax cut - which Republicans say would
spur the economy - would simply cut taxes for the wealthy.
   ``It's not quite an impasse, but it's pretty close to one,''
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said after the talks
ended.
   ``At this point we've reached an impasse,'' said another
bargainer, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   Today's session in the Capitol took on a sense of heightened
urgency. On Oct. 1 - the start of fiscal 1991 - the Gramm-Rudman
law will slash the $1.2 trillion budget by about $100 billion
unless a deficit-cutting deal is in place. A cut that deep would
violently disrupt government services.
   The breakdown of the talks at Andrews represented a major
disappointment to budget bargainers who initially hoped that three
or four days of meetings at the airfield would solve the fiscal
standoff that has lingered all year.
   But after meetings scheduled during varying intervals since
Sept. 7, neither Dole nor Gramm would rule out an eventual budget
pact. But neither could suggest how it could happen.
   ``It's going to be tough, but it's still not impossible, and no
one is giving up,'' said Dole. ``The problem is we're running out
of time.''
   The most profound gap between the two sides was over President
Bush's insistence that the package include a cut in the capital
gains tax rate. The tax is levied on sales of property. Supporters
say the reduction would invigorate the economy by spurring sales.
   Democratic leaders have long insisted that the idea would be a
windfall for the wealthy who own most property. They have said
they would only accept a capital gains tax cut if other taxes on
the rich were boosted. In their final offer Monday, the Democrats
demanded that the capital gains rate remain unchanged.
   ``The only way you can say we're at an impasse is if you know
you won't back off from the capital gains demand,'' said a
Democratic official involved in the talks, who asked to not be
identified.
   Republicans complained that there were other important
disagreements as well. Democrats wanted to rely on higher energy
taxes for about $49 billion during the next five years, seven times
the amount Republicans sought.
   The GOP offered to cut Pentagon spending over the next five
years by $170 billion below the amount needed to stay even with
inflation. Democrats said their reduction would be close to that
figure, but offered to lock in cuts for only the first two years:
$10 billion next year and $23.2 billion the following year.
   Republicans wanted to hold domestic programs to the rate of
inflation over the next five years. Democrats wanted to increase
that amount by $5 billion.
   For benefit programs like Medicare and farm price supports - one
of the fastest growing parts of the federal budget - Republicans
wanted to reduce growth by $123.3 billion through 1995. The
proposed Democratic cut was less deep, to the tune of $2.7 billion.
   The two sides also never reached agreement on how to control
spending in future years. For example, they continued to clash over
whether and how the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law should be
extended beyond its scheduled 1993 expiration.
   Despite those differences, the two sides had moved closer in a
number of areas.
   For example, they had tentatively agreed to about $59 billion in
tax increases, said one official who demanded anonymity. These
included higher levies on beer, wine, spirits, tobacco and luxury
items such as fancy cars, private boats and planes, electronic
equipment, furs and jewelry.
   They also agreed that about $25 billion in first-year savings
would come from new taxes and fees. Democrats wanted $130 billion
in new taxes and fees over five years, Republicans $138.1 billion.
   And although the two sides still differed over the size of
spending cuts, the gap between them in each area was dramatically
smaller than it was when the bargaining at Andrews began.
   Without action, next year's federal deficit is expected to be a
record $250 billion or more.

   Charles C. Cox, an economist and former
Securities and Exchange Commissioner, has been named chairman of
the United Shareholders Association, a nationwide shareholders'
rights group.
   Cox will succeed Texas oil man T. Boone Pickens, who founded the
group in 1986. Pickens will continue his affiliation with the
64,000-member group.
   The appointment of Cox, who will take over Oct. 1, was announced
late Monday at the group's annual meeting in Washington.
   The group also announced its latest list of 50 major U.S.
corporations targeted for shareholder activism.
   The 1991 Target 50 list, ranges from aerospace and automotive
manufacturer Allied-Signal Inc. to Xerox Corp.
   United Shareholders Director Ralph Whitworth said the group
plans to concentrate on four reforms: confidential voting in
corporate elections; elimination of ``poison pill'' anti-takeover
devices; shareholder approval of lucrative benefits - known as
``golden parachutes'' - paid to top management who lose their jobs
as a result of a takeover - and requiring companies to exempt
themselves from state anti-takeover laws that may apply to them.
   Those proposals will be introduced at the annual shareholders
meetings of the targeted 50 companies.
   ``Through the Target 50 program, we are encouraging companies to
enter into a constructive dialogue with their shareholders,'' said
Whitworth in a statement issued by the group.
   Cox, 45, the first economist to be appointed a member of the
SEC, stepped down in September 1989, to join a Chicago consulting
firm.
   He had been a member of the independent commission for nearly
six years. Before that he had been the SEC's chief economist since
September 1982.
   Before joining the SEC staff, Cox served from 1980 to 1982 as a
professor of management at Texas A&amp;M University and from 1972 to
1980 as an economics professor at Ohio State University.

<HEAD>Soybean, Corn Futures Edge Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean and corn futures prices edged higher in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade after the
government reported that development of those crops continues lag
behind the normal pace.
   Wheat futures were fractionally lower in trading described as
boring by Paul Sylvester of Gerald Inc., a commodities trading firm
in Chicago.
   The soybean market's early gains represented a turnaround after
Monday's steep losses.
   Analysts said the corn and soybean markets drew support from the
Agriculture Department's weekly crop progress report, which showed
leaves dropping in 22 percent of the soybean crop as of Sunday
compared with an average of 39 percent for that date.
   Thirty-three percent of the corn crop was in the mature stage as
of Sunday compared with the average pace of 61 percent, the USDA
said.
   The soybean complex also was supported by rumors that Pakistan
bought U.S. soybean oil overnight and that Taiwan may be in the
market for soybeans.
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to { cent lower
with the contract for delivery in September at $2.60{ a bushel;
corn futures were unchanged to 1 cent higher with September at
$2.36} a bushel; oats were \ cent lower to { cent higher with
September at $1.10{ a bushel; soybeans were 1} cents to 2\ cents
higher with September at $6.17\ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, extending Monday's strong gains
amid continued strength in the cash markets.
   Live cattle futures were .18 cent to .35 cent higher with
October at 79.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent lower
to .33 cent higher with September at 89.50 cents a pound; live hogs
were .10 cent lower to .60 cent higher with October at 53.60 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were .45 cent to .95 cent higher with
February at 57.60 cents a pound.

   The New York Post trumpeted ``YES!'' one day
after its front page had asked: ``Will the presses ever run
again?''
   The affirmation in today's editions of the saucy tabloid came
after Newspaper Guild members voted 242-45 Monday night to accept a
four-day work week, which will mean a 20 percent pay cut.
   Publisher Peter S. Kalikow had threatened to close the nation's
oldest continuously running daily immediately if the 350 Guild
members - news, advertising and clerical workers - rejected the
concessions. The paper is losing $27 million a year.
   Today, speaking in his office, Kalikow praised the unions for
accepting his conditions and predicted a bright future for the
paper. The Post should begin turning a profit next month, he said.
   ``Of the three tabloids in New York, you're now standing in the
only profitable one,'' Kalikow told reporters at a news conference.
   ``You feel like the executioner has loosened the noose,'' said
Jill Brooke, a Post TV and radio reporter who voted for approval.
``But we still have a life sentence: a 20 percent pay cut.''
   Nearly 1,000 people would have lost their jobs had the
505,000-circulation paper known for dishing up stories of sex,
murder and mayhem under screaming headlines had gone under.
   ``Let's go to press,'' Kalikow said after the vote. ``This is
not a management victory. It is not a labor victory. It is a
victory for all New Yorkers who deserve the honesty and diversity
offered in the pages of the New York Post.''
   The Guild was the last of 11 unions to approve concessions
designed to help Kalikow break even. He is said to have lost more
than $100 million personally since buying the paper from media
baron Rupert Murdoch in 1988. Two years ago, Kalikow won $24
million in concessions as a condition of the purchase.
   Monday's vote was taken by hand after a 90-minute meeting
punctuated by boos, applause and speeches for and against the
proposal. ``There was some blood on the floor,'' said reporter
Kieran Crowley.
   Reporter Peter Moses voted for the pay cut despite reservations.
``We accepted a package that none of us liked, we accepted a
package that made no sense to any of us and we accepted a package
that makes us less than middle class,'' he said.
   Before the pay cut, top salary for reporters was $853 a week.
   Kalikow promised the unions 20 percent of company stock and a
representative on the board of directors. In exchange he got $19
million in union concessions and $8 million in other cost
reductions, including management wage cuts.
   Sentiment swung in favor of the concessions when Kalikow also
said employees could approve the plan, then resign by Wednesday and
receive the same severance and termination pay as if the paper had
shut down.
   Theodore Kheel, an adviser to the unions, said Kalikow also
dropped his demand that 43 jobs be eliminated. Instead he will
settle for how ever many resignations he gets, Kheel said.
   ``A diversity of editorial voices is important in a democratic
society,'' Daily News publisher James Hoge said in a statement
congratulating the Post.
   That diversity may be diminished yet, however. A regional
economic slump has hurt advertising revenue at all the city's
papers. Newspaper analysts say that in the long haul there aren't
enough ads to keep all four major dailies alive.
   The New York Times is in the black but turning less of a profit
than a year ago. Times spokesman William Adler said the newspaper
would seek some of the concessions the Post got.
   The Daily News, a tabloid like the Post, said it has a ``me,
too'' clause in contracts with its unions that entitles it to the
concessions the Post got. Talks at the money-losing News have
stalemated and unions are urging advertisers to boycott it.
   New York Newsday, the city's third tabloid, is losing money
also, but its profitable parent, Times Mirror Co., is keeping the
paper alive.
   The Post has a long history of money woes - and owners with the
deep pockets and the patience to take heavy losses. Its founder,
Alexander Hamilton, was in debt in 1801 when he persuaded a group
of merchants to finance the paper.
   Banking heiress Dorothy Schiff bought the Post in 1939, turned
it into one of the nation's most liberal newspapers and brightened
it up with a tabloid format. It was losing money when she sold it
to Murdoch in 1976.
   The Post's fortunes seemed to have dimmed for good in the 1970s
as much of its audience moved to the suburbs. Recently, the slump
has deepened as an economic decline in the New York City further
cut advertising revenues.
   Murdoch transformed the Post into a politically conservative
paper, albeit one that featured sexy pictures, racy headlines -
like the famous ``HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR'' - and lots of
crime stories.
   In the past year, the Post ran such headlines like ``BASTARDS''
over a photo of a hanged hostage and ``BEST SEX I EVER HAD''
accompanying a picture of a smirking Donald Trump.
   Murdoch said the paper lost $150 million before he sold it for
$37 million to Kalikow, a real estate developer.
   Post Editor Jerry Nachman on Monday likened the Post to a
bumblebee.
   ``Aerodynamically, bumblebees ought not fly; the ratio of their
body weight to wingspan would make it physically impossible,'' he
said. ``But they absolutely refuse to understand that. So they fly.
That's the Post.''
   ``And like the bumblebee,'' he added, ``we keep stinging
people.''

   President Bush's urgent request for $1.9
billion to help pay for the U.S. military deployment in the Middle
East is running into trouble on Capitol Hill among lawmakers of
both parties.
   The biggest obstacle is a White House plan to forgive $6.7
billion in debts Egypt owes the United States for past military
equipment purchases.
   But lawmakers also are objecting to a proposal to set up a
``National Defense Gift Fund'' to receive money from allies that
then could be spent by the Pentagon, apparently without any control
by Congress.
   Rep. William Broomfield, the senior Republican on the House
Foreign Affairs Committee, dealt th package a blow on Monday when
he announced his opposition to canceling Egypt's debt.
   Broomfield, R-Mich., said the debt forgiveness would prompt a
wave of requests from countries that see it as a way to get more
foreign aid as budget negotiators seek to cut the deficit.
   ``I can't imagine a worse time for the administration to be
recommending forgiveness on this debt,'' he said in an interview.
Asked to assess the proposal's prospects on the House floor, he
said: ``I would say it would go down the tubes'' in its present
form.
   Israel, Poland and other countries already are lining up for
similar treatment, Broomfield said. In a statement on the House
floor, he added: ``The simple fact is that America can't afford
outright cancellation of Egypt's debt.''
   Broomfield's opposition came on the heels of skepticism by the
Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate Appropriations
subcommittees that must approve the package - Sen. Patrick Leahy of
Vermont and Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin.
   Obey said Monday that new figures from the Congressional Budget
Office show the debt forgiveness would cost $2.4 billion in lost
payments over the next five years, in contrast to the
administration's assertion that the move would have no budget
impact.
   Other influential lawmakers, including Senate Armed Services
Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., have expressed wariness about
seeking contributions from other countries to offset the cost of
the Persian Gulf military mobilization.
   They worry that the situation smacks of the mechanism used
during the Iran-Contra affair to insulate executive branch
decisions and actions from congressional oversight.
   ``Ollie North would have absolutely loved it,'' Obey said of the
administration's proposal to set up a new fund at the Pentagon out
of Congress' reach.
   When Bush sent his request to Congress on Friday, the request to
cancel Egypt's debt was linked to the supplemental money bill for
Operation Desert Shield. A senior administration official, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said the link was intended to improve
the prospects for forgiving the debt, which the White House knew
would be unpopular so close to congressional elections.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger sought last week
to persuade key lawmakers that Egypt's support in the gulf was
crucial to U.S. success, according to participants in the
discussions.
   Egypt has led the way in providing Arab troops to the deployment
in Saudi Arabia and has lobbied other Arab states to isolate Iraq's
Saddam Hussein, Eagleburger pointed out.
   Broomfield said he welcomed those moves, and added, ``I am sure
there are other ways America and other nations can help them
alleviate some of the economic problems caused by this crisis.''
   Perhaps the debt could be restructured, or the United States
could waive a requirement that all payments be up to date before a
country can receive new foreign aid, he said.
   To forgive all the debt, however, would be a sign that ``we may
have lost our senses,'' Broomfield said. ``This comes at a time
when our budget negotiators are figuring out ways to squeeze a few
more tax dollars out of America's sales clerks and farmers and
mechanics.''

   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait sent energy prices
spiraling, pushing the cost of living up a steep 0.8 percent in
August, the government said today.
   In a separate report, the Commerce Department said the U.S.
merchandise trade deficit jumped a dramatic 75 percent to $9.33
billion in July, the month before the invasion. Analysts expect the
deficit to climb further as the oil shock drives up imports.
   The gain in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index was
double the 0.4 percent rise in July and the largest since January,
when a severe cold snap pushed costs up 1.1 percent.
   Financial markets turned down in response to the double dose of
bad economic news. In the first 90 minutes of trading, the Dow
Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 23.77 points to
2,543.56.
   ``I think we'll have two, maybe three more months of high
inflation numbers,'' said economist Mark Zandi of Regional
Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa.
   The department attributed nearly half of the August increase to
the oil shock. Excluding energy prices, which jumped 4.3 percent,
consumer costs rose 0.4 percent.
   The Aug. 2 invasion sent gasoline prices up 7.6 percent, while
fuel oil prices jumped 15.4 percent. It was the steepest increase
in those categories since January.
   For the first eight months of 1990, prices rose at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 6.2 percent, up sharply from the 4.6
percent rise for all of 1989.
   More bad news is coming over the next several months, economists
believe. Crude oil prices have continued to rise in September and
will work their way through to the gasoline pump. Increases are
also ahead for chemicals, plastics and other petroleum-based
products.
   However, many analysts believe economic growth is too slow and
demand too weak to support a sustained inflation burst once oil
prices stabilize.
   In another report, the Labor Department said American's
inflation-adjusted earnings fell a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent
in August. Earnings fell 0.5 percent in each of the two previous
months.
   A bright spot in the August report was a moderation in food
price inflation. Food prices, held back by a decline in fruit and
vegetable prices, rose 0.3 percent, the smallest since May.
   Fresh fruit prices tumbled 4 percent, but dairy costs rose 1.3
percent. Prices in other food categories were up.
   The cost of housing, up 0.7 percent, and transportation, up 1.8
percent, were both driven by rising energy prices. Gasoline
accounted for nearly 90 percent of the transportation rise, the
department said.

<TEXT>
   In other categories, medical care rose 0.9 percent, in line with
a long string of sharp increases; tobacco was up only 0.3 percent
after having risen more than 2 percent in both July and June, and
clothing and upkeep costs were up a slight 0.1 percent.
   The various changes put the index for all consumer goods at
131.6 in August. That means that a hypothetical selection of goods
costing $100 in the 1982-84 base period cost $131.60 in August, up
from $7 from a year earlier.
   The recent combination of oil-induced inflation and slow
economic growth has put monetary policy-makers in a quandary. The
Federal Reserve normally pushes interest rates higher to fight
inflation and lower to stimulate lagging growth.

   Oil prices dipped this morning after reaching
record highs in the previous session.
   Prices were trading above the day's lows, however, as crude
rebounded a bit on an unconfirmed report that Iraq had killed a
civilian on the Kuwaiti border.
   ``The market seemed to take that and run with it a little bit,''
said Brendan Dolan, a broker with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Light sweet crude was trading at $33.50 per barrel for October
contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange late this morning,
down 13 cents from Monday's record close of $33.63.
   Oil opened lower today as traders sold futures, but it soon
began rallying on the bullish news from the Mideast.
   The November contract for crude was higher today, up 59 cents to
$32.75 per barrel in late morning trading. Dolan said November
crude, which was limited to a rise of $1 in Monday's trading under
the exchange's rules, was catching up with the higher price of
October contracts.
   Other crude futures were higher on near months and lower for
distant months.
   Petroleum product futures were higher today.
   Unleaded gasoline was up 1.28 cents to 92.95 cents per gallon on
October contracts, while home heating oil was up 2.39 cents to
87.70 cents per gallon on October contracts.
   Traders say heating oil has been outpacing oil because winter is
approaching.
   Natural gas prices showed little change, rising to $1.540 per
1,000 cubic feet, from $1.537 on October contracts.
   On Monday, crude oil hit its all-time intraday high on the
Mercantile Exchange, trading late in the day at $33.75 per barrel
on October contracts. The previous high, $32.35, had stood since
Aug. 2, 1983, and was matched once since Iraq invaded Kuwait last
month.
   The rise to a new record left traders wondering where oil will
go after heading into uncharted territory amid the volatility of
the persisting Persian Gulf crisis.

   Stocks slumped today as the market reacted
negatively to poor inflation and trade numbers.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks tumbled 27.48 to
2,539.85 by noon on Wall Street.
   Losing issues widely outdistanced advances on the New York Stock
Exchange by about 3 to 1, with 987 down, 333 up and 482 unchanged.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks
declined 1.59 to 173.03.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 66.15 million

Monday.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 1.99
to 319.72.
   Two government reports released before trading opened
intensified anxiety over the economy's condition.
   The Labor Department said consumer price inflation rose 0.8
percent in August, pushed up by the energy price spiral set in
motion by Iraq's Aug. 2 seizure of Kuwait.
   The gain in the Consumer Price Index, which was within the range
of market expectations, was double the 0.4 percent rise in July and
the largest since January, when a severe cold snap pushed costs up
1.1 percent.
   In a separate report, the Commerce Department said the U.S.
merchandise trade deficit jumped a dramatic 75 percent to $9.33

   ``I think we've had a whole series of economic
disappointments.,'' said Michael Metz, chief market analyst at

inflation or fight a recession.''
   The Federal Reserve Board is widely believed to be weighing the

<HEAD>GM Reportedly Can Close Plants at Will Under New Pact</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with meeting under way, detail from

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. is free to close plants at
will but will spend $4.2 billion to protect the income of employees
affected by cutbacks under its new labor agreement, a newspaper
said today.
   The tentative agreement covering 300,000 workers in 29 states
was reached early Monday after 41 hours of non-stop talks between
the United Auto Workers and the world's biggest automaker.
   This morning, the 300-member GM Bargaining Council met to
discuss the contract, the first step toward submitting the pact to
the membership.
   The meeting was closed, but a summary of contract details given
to group members included wage increases of 3 percent the first
year and lump-sum payments equal to 3 percent of wages in the
second and third years, and increases in monthly pensions for
workers with 30 years on the job from $1,500 to $1,800.
   The summary also cited $4.2 billion in income guarantees, and
indicated that language curbing the company's right to close plants
was eliminated. The Detroit Free Press reported today that the new
provision in effect gives GM the right to close plants at will.
   Pete Kelly, president of Local 160 at GM's Technical Center in
Warren, Mich., had some criticism for the settlement but said today
that he expected it would be overwhelmingly approved.
   ``I think for what general motors got, the economic package was
not sufficient,'' Kelly said.
   Under the pact, GM will guarantee workers laid off for up to 12
weeks in a year 95 percent of their wages by supplementing their
unemployment benefits, the newspaper said. Anyone laid off for more
than 12 weeks will be guaranteed full pay for the duration of the
contract, the paper said.
   Many analysts say GM will have to close at least four assembly
plants and lay off tens of thousands of people in an industry
threatened by a sluggish economy and foreign competition.
   If the bargaining council approves the agreement, it will be put
to a rank-and-file vote to be completed by the end of the month.
   ``We're all starving for information over here,'' said Joe
Garcia, financial secretary for Local 645 in Van Nuys, Calif.
   Assembly workers earn $15.27 an hor at GM, and cost-of-living
allowances that carry over from the previous contract would add
$2.15 an hour by 1993 if inflation runs at 5 percent a year, the
Free Press said.
   The 1987 contract expired at midnight Friday and negotiators
worked under a day-by-day extension through the weekend.
   The union's contracts cover more than 450,000 active workers at
GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. Talks between the union and
Ford and Chrysler have been on hold while the union concentrates on
GM, hoping to use the pact reached there as a pattern for
agreements with the other automakers.
   Chrysler and Ford said they would not comment on the UAW-GM
agreement until it was ratified.
   Ford is dealing with a strike at its Canadian plants by the
Canadian Auto Workers union that entered its fourth day today.
   The principal issue in Canada is money; in the United States it
is job security.
   Some Wall Street analysts said the chances for a strike this
year at GM were the best in years. But GM Vice President Alfred
Warren said Monday the talks signaled a new era of cooperation
between the union and the automaker.
   ``We feel the spirit we developed during the negotiations bodes
well for General Motors, the customer and the marketplace,'' Warren
said.
   While union members waited anxiously to hear what gains, if any,
had been made, most said they were happy a strike had been averted.
   ``I was kind of scared we were going to be off today, but since
we settled I'm glad,'' said J.D. Boatman, 61, who works at GM's
Cadillac plant in Detroit.

   Trading was suspended today at the Chicago Board
of Trade after an electrical problem knocked out power to most of
the 40-story downtown building, officials said.
   The power failure hit about two hours before the first trading
of the day was scheduled to begin at 7:20 a.m. CDT in financial
contracts such as Treasury bonds, said Frederick Grede, the
exchange's vice president of administration.
   Most of the building's electrical systems were knocked out of
commission, including electronic trading mechanisms, phones and
elevators, Grede said. Power also was out on the building's fourth
floor, where the trading pits are located, he said.
   Although few people were in the building initially, employees
and traders began arriving for work a short time later and scores
of them waited in the lobby rather than attempting to climb the
stairs to their offices, he said.
   No one was stuck in any of the elevators that stopped when the
power went out, Grede said.
   Commonwealth Edison Co. blamed the failure on a possible
electrical cable malfunction, and had restored power to all but
three floors by 7:40 a.m., said utility spokesman Bill Harrah.
   Trading began in financial contracts at 8:45 a.m., more than an
hour late. But trading in agricultural contracts began on time, at
9:30 a.m.
   The power failure was confined to the BOT building, which houses
offices of the exchange and member firms, Harrah said.
   ``There appears to have been a cable fault of one kind or
another inside the building,'' he said.
   Edison crews ``have done some switching around a damaged section
of cable,'' and were working on a transformer in an effort to
restore power to the remaining three floors, Harrah said.
   The power failure was the latest of several glitches that have
hit the Edison system this summer. The previous problems affected
several residential neighborhoods and knocked out power to
thousands of residents.

   The unions at United Airlines plan to meet with
banks this week to discuss a new offer of as much as $3.92 billion
for United's parent, UAL Corp., according to a published report
today.
   The Wall Street Journal said the new offer, the latest in a
series of on-again, off-again deals for one of the nation's biggest
airlines, could amount to $175 a share to $180 a share, or $3.82
billion to $3.92 billion.
   That would be well below the $201 a share, or $4.38 billion,
offer from a labor group that UAL's board accepted last April. That
pact has been scuttled by the financial uncertainty created by the
crisis in the Middle East.
   Citing unidentified officials close to the proposed deal, the
newspaper said the new offer probably will include participation by
a foreign airline.
   The story said a logical possibility would be British Airways
PLC, which was a principal equity investor in a $300-a-share
labor-management bid that collapsed last October.
   The Journal story said British Air declined to comment and
leaders of the buyout group declined to identify the foreign
carriers they say have expressed interest in backing the new offer.
   Last week, a United Airlines workers group announced it was
ending an agreement with an investment partnership to acquire UAL.
   In a filing Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the worker group, United Employee Acquisition Corp., said it was
still interested in acquiring the Chicago-based airline, however.
   The disclosure ended an agreement between UEAC and Coniston
Partners in April to help UEAC, a company formed by United's
unions, acquire UAL.
   The Wall Street Journal story said the unions have invited about
two dozen banks to this week's meeting where their financial
advisers are expected to outline plans for a new offer consisting
of cash and securities.
   One individual familiar with the agenda, the story said,
cautioned that plans for the new offer are ``still evolving and are
subject to change.''
   It also noted that it was unclear how the UAL board will greet a
lower offer.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Computer pioneer Steve Jobs unveiled four
new products today that he hopes will salvage his new company, Next
Computer Inc..
   The products included a more powerful, color-screen version of
the Next computer as well as an entry-level, under-$5,000 model -
half the cost of the current machine.
   Jobs said the company already has received orders for more than
15,000 of the new products.
   In addition, Lotus Development Corp., creator of the popular
1-2-3 spreadsheet, announced a new spreadsheet for the Next
computer, called Lotus Improv.
   The product provides a new approach to spreadsheets by enabling
users to click a mouse to view information. The software, designed
specifically for the Next computer, uses plain English formulas.
   Many other software developers were expected to announce new
applications programs for the Next throughout the all-day news
conference.
   The new products were designed to answer critics who say the
Next is too expensive, too slow, in need of a color monitor and
lacking imaginative software that would give people a compelling
reason to buy it.
   The Next machine was supposed to revolutionize personal
computers, much as did the Apple computer invented by Jobs and
Steve Wozniak in 1976, and Jobs' later Macintosh.
   To store data, the Next uses a removable optical disc, which
provides far greater capacity than the magnetic floppy discs found
on most personal computers. It also can reproduce sharp graphics
and has a built-in system that makes it easier for software
developers to write new programs.
   While Next has been praised for these high-tech innovations,
only several thousand of the machines have been sold, and Next has
failed to generate great interest among bread-and-butter corporate
computer users, analysts say.
   Businessland, a computer store chain that signed an exclusive
deal with Next in March 1989 to sell its machines domestically to
corporations, had predicted sales would hit $100 million in the
first year.
   But International Data Corp., a high-tech research firm,
estimates that fewer than 7,000 Nexts were sold as of June.
   At less than $5,000, the price tag makes the new machines
competitive with both the high-end personal computers of Apple
Computer Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. and the
low-end workstations of companies like Sun Microsstems Inc.
   Next, which is privately held, does not disclose its sales or
finances.
   Despite its sluggish start, no one is predicting Next's demise.
The company is heavily capitalized, and one of its principal
owners, the Japanese high-tech company Canon Inc., paid $100
million for a one-sixth share last year.
   Jobs founded Next in 1985 after leaving Apple in a dispute.

   Gasoline prices nationwide fell slightly in the

   The average retail price of a gallon of self-serve regular

invaded Kuwait and sent world oil prices skyrocketing, the AAA
said.
   In its latest spot check of stations, the AAA said the price of
a gallon of self-serve unleaded gasoline fell 0.2 cent to $1.292 a
gallon.
   AAA also reported these national averages for other fuels by the
self-serve gallon: regular leaded, $1.325; mid-grade unleaded,
$1.365; and premium unleaded, $1.461.
   Prices fell slightly in the Midwest, the Southeast and the West.
Small increases were found in New England and the Mid-Atlantic and
Great Lakes regions.
   The previous AAA gasoline survey was on Sept. 11.

   Stocks slumped today as the market reacted
negatively to poor inflation and trade numbers.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was off 20.30 to
2,547.03 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street, improving from a loss of 27.48
points two hours earlier.
   Losing issues widely outdistanced advances on the New York Stock
Exchange by about 8 to 3, with 1,037 down, 386 up and 472
unchanged.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks
declined 1.28 to 173.34.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 92.25 million
shares with two hours left to go in the session.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 2.42
to 319.29.
   Two government reports released before trading opened
intensified anxiety over the economy's condition.
   The Labor Department said consumer price inflation rose 0.8
percent in August, pushed up by the energy price spiral set in
motion by Iraq's Aug. 2 seizure of Kuwait.
   The gain in the Consumer Price Index, which was within the range
of market expectations, was double the 0.4 percent rise in July and
the largest since January, when a severe cold snap pushed costs up
1.1 percent.
   In a separate report, the Commerce Department said the U.S.
merchandise trade deficit jumped a dramatic 75 percent to $9.33
billion in July.
   ``I think we've had a whole series of economic
disappointments.,'' said Michael Metz, chief market analyst at
Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ``The question is whether the Fed opts to fight
inflation or fight a recession.''
   The Federal Reserve Board is widely believed to be weighing the
need to pump life into the economy by lowering interest rates.
   The central bank has indicated it would be inclined to relax its
monetary policy if White House and congressional negotiators agree
on ways to trim the budget deficit. But inflation considerations
might stay the Fed's hand - especially if the Middle East crisis
drags on and keeps oil prices rising.
   Activity in the stock market appeared to be easing this
afternoon from a moderate pace earlier in the day. Trading is
expected to be slow later in the week when some participants take
time off Thursday for Rosh Hashana, the Jewish new year.
   UAL soared 8| to 106. The Wall Street Journal reported that

   Redwood Summer will turn to ``Corporate

   The protests will denounce ``corporate greed and corruption,''
Earth First! activist Darryl Cherney said Monday.
   Unlike the Redwood Summer protests, which were held only in
California, Corporate Fall protests will be held nationwide,
Cherney said. The first protest is scheduled Sept. 27 at Maxxam

   Timber officials doubt the success of the new strategy.
   ``The name `Corporate Fall' doesn't have a good ring to it,''
said Georgia-Pacific spokesman Dave Odgers. ``They're going to have
a hard time selling it. Redwood Summer had a good ring.''
   Most of the 70 Redwood Summer protests were held in Humboldt

enforcement and court costs.

<HEAD>United States Modifies Demands on Abolishing Farm Export Subsidies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARE NULLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top American trade official said Tuesday that
the United States is ready to relax its demands for abolishing farm
export subsidies, a step that could help resolve a dispute
threatening world trade talks.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said that Washington would
propose reductions of up to 70 percent in domestic farm supports
and import duties, and more than 70 percent in export assistance.
   The proposal is to be submitted to the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, which is sponsoring the latest Round of trade
liberalization talks. The talks are to conclude early December.
   The 105-nation negotiations, launched in Uruguay four years ago,
are deadlocked because of disagreement between the United States
and the European Community over farm supports.
   There also are significant differences on how to liberalize
trade in textiles and over the scope of new rules to cover trade in
services such as banking.
   On textiles, Hills said that the United States was ready to
accept that the existing system of protection should be phased out.
But she defended the U.S. view that aviation should be exempt from
a services agreement.
   At the heart of the farm trade dispute is the EC's refusal to
dismantle its system of export subsidies to help farmers compete on
foreign markets. The United States, backed by farm exporting
nations led by Australia, has until now insisted on a complete
phaseout.
   A text being used as the basis of negotiations in Geneva
provides for ``substantial, progressive reductions'' in support,
with the greatest cuts in export subsidies.
   Hills said the U.S. proposal would achieve the goal. All
proposals have to be submitted to GATT by October 15.
   Trade ministers are to meet in Brussels for final talks in less
than two months. Hills was in Geneva with a delegation of top U.S.
businessmen on the first leg of a week-long European trip.
   She dismissed an EC proposal for overall reductions of 30
percent as inadequate, adding that the 12-nation trading bloc
wanted to use as abase year 1986, when levels of support were
particularly high.
   Hills said the United States would compromise on a method of
liberalizing trade in textiles ``if that pushes us further down the
road'' toward an agreement.
   Third World textile exporters have argued that trade, worth some
$177 billion annually, should be liberalized by winding down an
existing system under which import quotas are fixed in bilateral
deals.

   Soybean futures prices rose moderately Tuesday on
the Chicago Board of Trade, recovering most of the ground lost in
the previous session amid talk of possible frost in the Midwest
early next week.
   Most corn futures also advanced but wheat futures retreated
slightly.
   Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice president for grain trading
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said some private forecasters
predicted frost in the Midwest by Monday, fueling fears of damage
to the slowly maturing soybean and corn crops.
   A weekly government report on Monday showed leaves dropping in
22 percent of the soybean crop as of Sunday compared with an
average of 39 percent for that date.
   Thirty-three percent of the corn crop was in the mature stage as
of Sunday compared with the average pace of 61 percent, according
to the Agriculture Department report.
   Even before frost entered the forecasts, traders were concerned
that the current spate of cool, rainy weather in the Midwest would
continue to slow crop development.
   At the close, wheat futures were { cent to 1{ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in September at $2.59{ a bushel; corn was

   The European Community declared Tuesday that the
Gulf crisis should not be allowed to derail an international
free-trade accord due to be reached this December.
   ``The message we wish to pass to everyone is that this crisis
cannot have a protectionist response,'' Italy's foreign trade
minister, Renato Ruggiero said.
   The foreign trade ministers of the 12 EC members met to discuss
the latest round of trade liberalization talks. The talks is being
held under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
   The 105-nation negotiations are blocked mainly because of
disagreement between the United States and the EC over farm
supports.
   EC members fear that some countries will be reluctant to commit
themselves to strict trade agreements when their economies are
suffering from higher oil prices due to the crisis prompted by
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   To resolve the problem, the EC ministers discussed providing
greater access to the markets of industrialized countries for
textiles, a major product of the developing world.
   ``Certainly we are ready to move on access to our markets, but
on this question we need the cooperation of other industrialized
countries,'' Ruggiero said. He singled out the United States, which
he said had maintained too many barriers to textile imports.
   Ruggiero spoke on behalf of the 12 ministers since Italy holds
the presidency of the EC.
   Frans Andriessen, the vice president of the EC Commission, told
reporters the willingness by the United States to move away from a
system of global textile quotas had brought Washington and the EC
closer together on the issue.
   Under the system now in place, the Multifiber Arrangement,
import quotas are fixed in bilateral deals. The EC wants to
dismantle the system gradually.

<TEXT>
   A top executive for media mogul Ted Turner
resigned unexpectedly in the latest departure by officials who
helped build Turner Broadcasting System into a $1.2 billion cable
television giant.
   Gerald F. Hogan, 44, resigned Monday to become vice chairman of
Whittle Communications L.P., a Knoxville, Tenn.-based media
company.
   Hogan, a 19-year veteran of Turner Broadcasting, was president
of Turner Entertainment Networks, a member of the company's
executive committee and a company director.
   His resignation follows by a year the resignation of Turner's
former No. 2 executive, Robert J. Wussler, who quit to head Comsat
Video Enterprises. Several other top executives have left or
announced retirement plans since Wussler departed.
   ``Gerry has played an important role in the success of our
company. We wish him well in his new endeavor,'' Turner said in a
statement.
   Hogan joined Turner Broadcasting in 1971 as an advertising
account executive for WTCG, the independent station that now is
SuperStation TBS. He worked on the sales side of the company before
becoming president in 1987 of the entertainment networks, TBS and
Turner Network Television.
   Hogan's departure leaves Terence F. McGuirk as the No. 2 man at
Turner Broadcasting. McGuirk, who joined the company in 1972, is
president of Turner Cable Network Sales and Turner Sports.
   Hogan and McGuirk functioned as operational heads of the
corporation, their roles increasing in stature as Turner withdrew
from the day-to-day running of the company.

   In the fiercely competitive greeting card
industry, Among Friends is a grain of sand on a beach dominated by
giants like Hallmark Cards, American Greetings and Gibson
Greetings.
   But the alternative card company, which was formed two years ago
by three women in this Lake of the Ozarks community in central
Missouri, has set some lofty goals.
   ``People say, `Oh, is your goal to have Hallmark buy you out?' I
say, `no, our goal is to buy Hallmark,' '' Claudia Parrish, one of
the company's founders, said with a poker face.
   She quickly breaks into a smile and laughs at the thought of the
tiny, anonymous firm gobbling up Hallmark, the industry leader,
which reportedly notched $1.25 billion in greeting card sales last
year.
   But Parrish and her partners, Roxie Kelly and Shelly
Reeves-Smith, are serious about carving their own niche in a market
ruled by huge corporations.
   In just a couple of years, Among Friends has expanded from
selling a few cards in local shops to marketing a line of 36
all-occasion cards, gift tags, decorative bags and a
card-organizing notebook in 48 states, Japan and England. The
company is working to expand that line.
   Parrish, the company's business manager, says Among Friends
tripled its sales in the past year and now has about 1,300
accounts. She refused to disclose any figures.
   ``We don't even want them to know we exist,'' added
Reeves-Smith.
   Rudolf Hokanson, who tracks the greeting card industry for Blunt
Ellis &amp; Loewy in Milwaukee, said the company has one advantage:
alternative cards are the fastest growing segment of the industry.
   ``It's impossible to say whether (Among Friends) will survive,''
Hokanson said. ``It's a competitive field, and there are a lot of
quality players. Like with any business, if they have a good
management team and marketing people . . . I think they've got a
chance.''
   The women say they are somewhat surprised at the company's
limited success considering the mistakes they made in the early
going.
   ``We knew nothing about the greeting card industry,'' Kelly
recalled. ``We made some of the worst mistakes you can imagine. But
the cards sold anyway. It was amazing how much people liked them.''
   The women say the company name was a natural because of their
long friendships.
   Kelly, 35, a former physical education teacher, used to own a
popular restaurant and a combination gourmet bakery-gift shop at
the lake. She handles marketing duties and maintains contact with
about 35 sales representatives.
   Parrish, 49, was a hostess at the restaurant and a business
partner in a cookbook Kelly wrote and sold. She keeps a close eye
on the finances.
   The artist, Reeves-Smith, 24, was a student of Kelly's and later
worked in her restaurant and bakery. A longtime friend of the
Parrish family, Reeves-Smith also designed the cover of her
friends' cookbook.
   Kelly and Parrish credit Reeves-Smith, a 1988 art graduate, for
much of Among Friends' success.
   Reeves-Smith works with colored pencils and ink to design
``subjects that conjure up soothing, pleasant feelings, like a hat
box, an old clock, a New England house - that's the style I feel
most comfortable with.''
   The result is detailed, intimate cards featuring a soft,
water-color appearance.
   The message inside is often inspirational, featuring classic
poems or a verse the women came up with themselves. Some contain a
favorite recipe, like Kelly's blueberry-peach-cinnamon muffins.
   The women say that even though they work so closely together
they've managed to stay good friends.
   ``We don't always agree, but we respect each other for our
individual talents and opinions,'' Kelly said. ``We were friends
before we were partners and we want it to stay that way.''

<HEAD>Stock Moves Higher on Word of New Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp. stock jumped Tuesday on a report that
unions might propose a new buyout offer for as much as $3.92
billion, once again prolonging the takeover maneuvering for the
parent of United Airlines.
   The Wall Street Journal said a union group seeking to acquire
the company might propose buying it for $175 to $180 a share in
cash and securities, about $20 a share less than the group's
earlier $4.38 billion offer that collapsed last month.
   But the Journal said it could include participation by British
Airways PLC, a financially powerful foreign airline that could make
the takeover offer more feasible. British Airways had an equity
stake in a $300-a-share offer for UAL that died last October,
partly because it heavily relied on debt financing.
   Officials at the unions, United and British Airways declined
comment on the Journal story, and industry analysts expressed
skepticism about the latest reported offer.
   ``The lower the price the more difficult it is for the board to
justify taking it, having already said $300 (per share) was
adequate,'' said Robert J. Joedicke, an airlines analyst for
Shearson Lehman Brothers in New York.
   Still, word of a possible new deal boosted the value of UAL
stock, which has languished since the last offer fell apart. The
Journal said the unions planned to meet with banks this week to
discuss the idea.
   UAL advanced $8.25 a share to $105.62{ in late-afternoon trading
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The new proposal would be the latest in a series of on-again,
off-again deals for one of the nation's biggest airlines. It would
be well below the $201-a-share, or $4.38 billion, offer from a
labor group that UAL's board accepted last April.
   That pact has been scuttled by the financial uncertainty created
by the crisis in the Middle East.
   One individual familiar with the agenda, the newspaper said,
cautioned that plans for the new offer are ``still evolving and are
subject to change.''
   It also noted that it was unclear how the UAL board would greet
a lower offer.
   Last month, UAL directors gave the union group until Oct. 9 to
secure financing for the deal. But they also indicated that any
restructured offer would have to retain the shareholder value
contemplated in the $201-a-share bid made in April.
   Some analysts said that any participation by British Airways
likely would help the unions secure additional financing.
   ``If that's true and if British Airways puts some equity into
the deal, that will make it easier to sell to the bank group,''
said Robert Decker, an industry analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps in
Chicago.
   But Decker added, ``My impression is that it's going to be
difficult for the unions. I think they have to bring a done deal to
the board.''
   According to the newspaper, the unions have recruited First
Chicago Corp. to join three other institutions as lead banks for a
proposed bank credit of about $2 billion.
   First Chicago spokeswoman Lisabeth Weiner would neither confirm
nor deny the report.

   Bad news on inflation and trade unsettled the
stock market today but an afternoon rebound enabled the blue chips
to eke out a small gain.
   Two government reports released before trading opened
intensified anxiety over the economy's condition.
   The Labor Department said consumer prices rose 0.8 percent in
August, pushed up by the energy price spiral set in motion when
Iraq seized Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The gain in the Consumer Price Index, which was within the range
of market expectations, was double the 0.4 percent rise in July and
the largest since January, when a severe cold snap pushed costs up
1.1 percent.
   In a separate report, the Commerce Department said the U.S.
merchandise trade deficit jumped a dramatic 75 percent to $9.33
billion in July.
   ``I think we've had a whole series of economic
disappointments.,'' said Michael Metz, chief market analyst at
Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ``The question is whether the Fed opts to fight
inflation or fight a recession.''
   The Federal Reserve Board is widely believed to be weighing
whether to pump life into the economy by lowering interest rates.
   The central bank has indicated it would be inclined to relax its
monetary policy if White House and congressional negotiators agree
on ways to trim the budget deficit. But inflation considerations
might stay the Fed's hand - especially if the Middle East crisis
drags on and keeps oil prices rising.
   Activity in the stock market eased this afternoon from a
moderate pace earlier in the session. Trading is expected to remain
slow later in the week when some participants take off Thursday for
Rosh Hashana, the Jewish new year.

<HEAD>NCR Announces New Computer Line Based on Open Systems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NCR Corp. said Tuesday it would replace its
entire computer line with industry-standard machines that all could
communicate with each other - a first for an old-line computer
maker.
   The new models from a company better known for its cash
registers and automated teller machines could strenghten NCR's
presence in the computer industry, where it has only done well
among retailing and banking customers, analysts said.
   ``What we are about to see is whether a standard, open-systems
product line can get them into the mainstream or not,'' said Rick
Martin, who follows computers for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   NCR said it would produce the entire computer line, from tiny
laptop models to extremely powerful mainframes, from the same Intel
Corp. computer chips. That would make NCR the first company to use
the same microprocessor for a product line this broad, analysts
said.
   Using the same microprocessor, the computer-on-a-chip that is
the brain of modern computers, would make the line compatible,
meaning a laptop could get at information stored on a mainframe.
   NCR also said the computers would run industry-standard
operating systems, which control a computer's internal functions.
   The computer lines of most major makers - including NCR - are
divided between proprietary, or company-specific, processing
systems and ``open,'' or industry-standard, systems. That means
various models sold by the same company often are incompatible.
   Applications software, such as database or word-processing
programs, must be tailored to a specific operating system. If the
software is designed for a proprietary system it can't be used on
any other type of computer.
   But corporations increasingly want to be able to use the same
applications software on all their machines and to connect
computers in networks, which can be troublesome with incompatible
models.
   NCR executives, speaking at a New York news conference, said
their new line would address those concerns.
   The Dayton, Ohio-based company said it eventually would provide
computers in seven ``levels,'' or ranges of performance and size.
On Tuesday it announced six machines in three levels, ranging from
desktop workstatons to mainframe-class machines, priced from
$10,000 to $800,000.
   The higher-end models of the new line derive their power by
linking multiple Intel microprocessors in an emerging technique
called parallel processing.
   NCR said it will power the models planned for the top of the
line by hooking together thousands of microprocessors. However, NCR
didn't say when those models would be available.
   NCR said the most powerful model will process more than 100,000
million instructions per second, or mips, a standard measure of
computing speed. By contrast, IBM's new top-of-the-line model,
announced earlier this month, will operate at about 230 mips,
analysts say.
   But operating systems and applications software need to be
developed to exploit the parallel-processing technology, analysts
say. Software used for standard mainframes, which have up to eight
processors, would not run on machines with thousands of processors.
   In related news Tuesday, the Unix development unit of American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said would modify the Unix operating
system for use on multiple-processor computers. Unix was created by
AT&amp;T.
   In coming weeks, NCR said it will announce software and
networking systems that will allow the new computer line to be
connected throughout a company.
   NCR sells less than $5 billion worth of computers a year, out of
a global market of $200 billion, according to the investment firm
Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. By comparison, IBM, the industry leader,
has sales of about $60 billion.

<HEAD>Stotler Securities Subsidiary Settles SEC Charges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government securities subsidiary of
Stotler Group Inc. has lost its registration with the Securities
and Exchange Commission as part of a settlement of regulatory
charges, the SEC announced Tuesday.
   Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, Stotler and Co., the
affiliate of the troubled Chicago futures concern, settled an SEC
administrative action brought last month.
   As a result, Stotler's SEC registration as a government
securities broker dealer was revoked.
   Stotler and Co., which was also a major futures brokerage until
earlier this summer when it ran into money and legal problems,
settled a similar administrative action with federal futures
regulators.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission still has a civil
lawsuit pending against another Stotler subsidiary, Stotler Funds
Inc., that alleges misuse of $5 million in customer funds.
   Stotler Group and Stotler and Co. last month filed for
liquidation under federal bankruptcy law.
   Stotler Group was headed by former Chicago Board of Trade
Chairman Karsten ``Cash'' Mahlmann until a day after the CFTC sued
alleged misuse of customer funds. Mahlmann, who resigned as head of
the world's largest futures exchange the same day, has not been
accused of any illegal activity.
   The SEC began administrative proceedings Aug. 21 against Stotler
and Co. charging the concern with violating regulations concerning
the sale of government securities.
   The SEC accused Stotler and Co. of selling or trying to sell
government securities since November 1988 without being a member of
a registered securities association, such as the National
Association of Securities Dealers.
   The SEC also accused Stotler of failing to maintain a minimum
amount of cash and assets to offset risks, the so-called net
capital requirement. Stotler and Co. also was accused of not
keeping proper records, including filing financial reports with the
SEC.
   Ron Peterson, a Chicago lawyer appointed trustee of Stotler and
Co. by the bankruptcy court, did not immediately return a telephone
call Tuesday seeking comment.

<HEAD>Gulf Turmoil Should Help Big Oil's Bottom Line, But Amount Unclear</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The jump in oil prices caused by the Persian
Gulf crisis should make big oil companies at least a little fatter,
but the size of any windfalls will vary, experts say.
   Companies that pump plenty of their own crude should bring in
the most extra cash for the third quarter. Those more heavily
involved in selling refined products such as gasoline will not fare
as well.
   Major oil companies, like other corporations, refuse to make
public predictions of their earnings.
   But this fall, when big oil reports its profits from the weeks
following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, industry observers will have a
heightened interest in the bottom line.
   The political turmoil in the Mideast has pushed oil prices to
the highest levels since the mid 1980s, and there have been
warnings of a public outcry if oil companies appear to be making
too much money by exploiting the situation.
   Analysts predict stronger earnings, although the size remains
uncertain. Some say oil companies might try to lessen the potential
negative publicity from higher earnings by setting aside more money
into reserve funds that will be used for such items as future
litigation or oil-spill containment.
   ``The companies are going to be very sensitive to the public
view of making profits or larger profits in this environment,''
said Jim Murchie, an oil analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.
Inc.
   ``They will scour their liabilities and reserve requirements and
maybe ... take larger reserves for cleanups and that kind of thing
so as to serve, if you will, to dampen the reported earnings,''
Murchie said Tuesday. ``They have to not be seen to be profiteering
from this, and they're really not. If you look at these earnings,
they're really getting hammered at the pump.''
   Although oil companies are making more money for the crude they
sell, they also end up paying more for the oil they buy. The full
costs of higher crude have not been passed on to consumers who buy
gasoline, which cuts the profit margins of retail operations.
   Other industry observers doubt the companies will seek to dilute
higher profits through fancy accounting techniques, saying such a
move would be easily detected by critics.
   ``I don't think there'll be any special shenanigans among the
big guys,'' said Professor James M. Patterson of the Indiana
University School of Business. ``That would be so obvious that it
would be more trouble for them than to just show the increased
profits.''
   Even though the price of oil has shot up from about $20 per
barrel to more than $30 per barrel since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug.
2, analysts are divided over how much money that will mean for the
majors.
   ``For companies that are sensitive to crude oil prices, it's
going to be very good,'' said Philip L. Dodge, an oil analyst with
Nomura Securities International Inc. ``For refiners it's going to
be temporarily lower. For the quarter, they haven't been able to
pass on all the increase.''
   Robin Shoemaker at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. does not think
the companies will be able to turn profits that are notably bigger.
   ``In terms of earnings, they're going to show very modest if any
improvement over the second quarter,'' Shoemaker said.
   But even companies that are heavily involved in the
less-profitable businesses such as retail gasoline sales should
come out of the oil crisis with a better bottom line, Patterson
said.
   ``Basically, there's been a windfall due to the increase in
price and the increase in demand as well,'' Patterson said.

<TEXT>
   United Mine Workers President Richard
Trumka, rebuffed in efforts to merge with the main oil industry
union, said Tuesday a national energy union is the only way to win
concessions from big business.
   Trumka, addressing the UMW's 100th anniversary convention, said
only a unified labor organization can combat multinational oil and
coal conglomerates with diversified interests.
   He said it unions had to ``do what we must to challenge those
corporate Goliaths on their own turf, not only as the union of the
coal fields, but as the union of energy workers.''
   Dividing workers in oil, coal, power and petrochemical
industries ``is the modern equivalent of craft unionism,'' Trumka
said, referring to the policy of having a separate union for every
task at a job site.
   At its 1986 convention, the UMW gave its governing body, the
International Executive Board, authority to seek a merger with
other energy unions. A proposed merger with the Oil, Chemical and
Atomic Workers, however, collapsed in 1987 when the OCAW's board
balked at the proposal.
   Talks between the unions later resumed, but the two sides were
unable to reach an agreement before the coal miners' convention
began Monday.
   Also Tuesday, the UMW's chief financial officer asked the 1,000
convention delegates for permission to use interest from a strike
fund to pay legal, advertising and negotiating costs associated
with strikes.
   The strike fund, at $57.4 million as of Aug. 31, was set up
during the 1983 convention, but it was limited to paying strike
benefits directly to miners.
   UMW Secretary-Treasurer John Banovic said those pay and health
benefits totaled $5 million during 1989, including payments to
workers during the 10-month strike against The Pittston Co. in West
Virginia, Virginia and Kentucky that ended last February. But he
said the total cost of strikes in 1989 was $60 million to $70
million.
   In addition, the union faces $52 million in fines levied by a
Virginia judge for Pittston-related strike activities. Banovic said
the strike fund generates about $4 million a year at current
interest rates.
   Delegates are to vote later on that proposal, plus another that
would give the union's international executive board authority to
close or merge some of the 21 union districts in the United States
and Canada.

<HEAD>African Producers Call for Return of Export Quotas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   African countries Tuesday appealed for the return
of export quotas to lift and stabilize the depressed price of
coffee, because of the huge losses they are suffering in the
present free market for beans.
   The objective of the continent's producers was a new
International Coffee Agreement among exporting and importing
countries to regulate supplies and prices, said Filomeno Ceita, the
Angolan president of the 25-nation Inter-African Coffee
Organization.
   He said African producing countries had lost $1.2 billion in
export revenue since the suspension 15 months ago of the present
coffee agreement's export quota system, which stabilized prices by
matching supplies to demand.
   Colombia - the world's second-biggest producer behind Brazil -
also wanted to see quotas back under a new pact, said Jorge
Cardenas, the country's chief coffee executive.
   The main obstacle to the opening of negotiations on a new coffee
pact was uncertainty over Brazil's position, said Ceita, who is
attending a two-week meeting here of the 72-nation International
Coffee Organization.
   No new pact could work effectively without the participation of
the world's biggest producer and exporter, delegates said.
   Brazil is expected to disclose its attitude toward calls for
negotiations on a new international agreement next week, when the
head of its delegation arrives for producer-consumer talks.
   The coffee organization meeting opened Sept. 17, and is
scheduled to end Sept. 28.
   The present coffee agreement, which lacks powers to regulate
supplies and prices, expires Sept. 30, 1991.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Tumble After Squeeze Fails to Develop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices fell sharply Tuesday on New York's
Commodity Exchange after an expected rally linked to the expiration
of copper options in London failed to materialize.
   On other commodity markets, precious metals, energy futures,
grains and soybeans, and livestock and meat futures all were mixed.
   Copper futures settled 2.35 cents to 3.95 cents lower in Chicago
with the contract for delivery in September at $1.30 a pound.
   The September contract traded as low as $1.282 a pound during
the session, following a sharp decline on the London Metal Exchange
that analysts attributed to disappointed selling by traders who had
expected strong gains.
   Those expectations stemmed from perceptions that a ``squeeze''
or partial corner of the copper market was developing in London,
where options on September copper deliveries are nearing
expiration.
   But analysts said it became apparent Tuesday that the squeeze
play had fizzled, prompting many traders who had bet on higher
prices to exit the market.
   ``They all started liquidating because it wasn't going up,''
said Susan Kashan, a copper trading assistant with PaineWebber Inc.
in New York.
   She said selling accelerated when the heavily traded December
contract hit $1.23 a pound, 4.75 cents below Monday's settlement.
December copper fell as low as $1.217 before bouncing back to end
at $1.24.
   William O'Neill of Merrill Lynch said copper's supply-and-demand
factors remain bullish, although the market has fallen
substantially since the spot price represented by the September
contract reached a 12-month high of $1.384 a pound on Sept. 12.
   O'Neill said Tuesday's action was typical.
   ``We hear talk all the time of these types of squeezes, both in
London and New York,'' he said. ``Normally the fears are
exaggerated and this is such a case.''
   Gold futures fell moderately on the Commodity Exchange, ending a
five-day rally amid selling that O'Neill attributed to a lack of
significant developments in the Persian Gulf.
   Gold settled $1.40 to $1.90 lower with September at $387.60 a
troy ounce; silver was 2.4 cents to 2.8 cents higher with September
at $4.79 a troy ounce.
   Near-term crude oil futures ended modestly lower on the New York
Mercantile Exchange while contracts for deferred deliveries rose.
The pattern was similar in the gasoline market but heating oil
futures advanced strongly.
   Some of the action reflected positioning ahead of the American
Petroleum Institute's weekly stocks report, which was released
after the close.
   The report showed a larger-than-expected decline in U.S.
supplies of crude oil and an unexpected increase in gasoline
stocks. Heating oil supplies rose, as expected.
   Light sweet crude oil futures settled 22 cents lower to 53 cents
higher with October at $33.41 a barrel; heating oil was 1.12 cents
to 1.44 cents higher with October at 86.43 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .22 cent lower to .81 cent higher with October at
91.61 cents a gallon.
   Soybean futures rose moderately on the Chicago Board of Trade,
recovering most of the ground lost in the previous session amid
talk of possible frost in the Midwest early next week.
   Most corn futures also advanced but wheat futures retreated
slightly.
   Wheat futures settled { cent to 1{ cents lower with September at
$2.59{ a bushel; corn was { cent lower to 1\ cents higher with
September at $2.37 a bushel; oats were 1{ cents higher across the
board with September at $1.10} a bushel; soybeans were 1} cents to
7 cents higher with September at $6.22{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures ended mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange ahead of Wednesday's monthly Agriculture Department
cattle-on-feed report.
   The report is expected to show about a 4 percent increase over a
year ago in the number of cattle on feedlots in the seven largest
producing states.
   Live cattle settled unchanged to .20 cent higher with October at
79.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .08 cent
higher with September at 89.25 cents apound; live hogs were .05
cent lower to .47 cent higher with October at 53.47 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .13 cent lower to .17 cent higher with
February at 56.82 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises in New York After Overseas Drop; Gold Prices Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rebounded on domestic markets Tuesday
after falling in response to a disappointing U.S. trade report.
   Gold prices were mostly lower, rising only in Hong Kong trading
overnight.
   The dollar dropped after the government reported the trade
deficit climbed to $9.33 billion in July from June's revised $5.34
billion. The shortfall was nearly $2 billion greater than forecast.
   Robert Hatcher, a foreign exchange dealer at Barclays Bank PLC
in New York, said the dollar was supported in part by rumors that
negotiators in Washington are nearing an agreement to reduce the
federal budget deficit by $50 billion.
   Dealers also said the dollar gained for technical reasons
including buying by traders adjusting their holdings. But most of
Tuesday's activity focused on other currencies, especially the
Japanese yen, which fell sharply, reversing a recent upward trend.
   The yen has been on a roller-coaster lately, plunging after the
Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and then recovering as Japanese
investments regained their appeal.
   Hatcher said there were again concerns in the market that Japan,
which imports 99 percent of its oil, would be hurt economically by
the surge in oil prices that has resulted from the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   The dollar gained more than 1 yen Tuesday, closing at 137.75 yen
in New York, compared with 136.55 yen late Monday. In Tokyo
overnight, the dollar rose to 137.68 yen from 137.00 yen Monday,
and in London, the dollar was quoted at 137.55 yen.
   Despite the dollar's gains Tuesday, Hatcher warned, ``We are
still in a speculative market.'' He said traders were waiting to
see what moves the Federal Reserve might make to bring U.S.
interest rates down as the economy weakens.
   In the meantime, ``there's a lot of churning but no real
trending,'' Hatcher said, predicting the U.S. currency would remain
in a broad trading range.
   The dollar was unchanged against the British pound in New York,
where sterling closed at $1.9140. In London earlier, the pound rose
to $1.9190 from $1.9025 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.5525 German marks, up from 1.54865; 1.2900
Swiss francs, up from 1.2768; 5.1995 French francs, up from 5.1870;
1,162.50 Italian lire, up from 1,1160.00; and 1.5895 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.5725.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Monday, included: 1.5480 German marks, down from 1.5575; 1.2825
Swiss francs, down from 1.2865; 5.1845 French francs, down from
5.2160; 1.7535 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7550; 1,160.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,165.00, and 1.1573 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1593.
   Gold fell in New York, where a troy ounce of gold lost $1.80 to
close at $387.60 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange. Republic
National Bank later quoted a bid of $388.10, down $2.40
   In London, gold fell to a late bid of $388.25 a troy ounce from
$389.75 late Monday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid of
$387.80 an ounce from $389 late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.48 an ounce to close at
$389.85.
   Silver prices rose. Silver gained 2.4 cents and closed at $4.790
on the Commodity Exchange, and it advanced in London to a late bid
of $4.82 a troy ounce, up from $4.78 late Monday.

   The stock market chalked up scattered gains
Tuesday, thanks to an afternoon rebound amid renewed optimism about
the chances for lower interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which was off more than
20 points at 2 p.m. on Wall Street, closed up 3.96 points at
2,571.29. It briefly sported a double-digit gain in the last hour
of a volatile session.
   Broader market measures finished with negative readings,
however.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by more than 4 to 3
in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 626 up, 854 down and 501 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board expanded to 141.13 million
shares from 110.60 million Monday and the highest daily total since
160.15 million on Aug. 27. Activity on Wall Street is expected to
slow later this week when some traders take off for Rosh Hashana,
the Jewish new year, on Thursday.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 169.44 million shares.
   Two government reports released before trading opened
intensified anxiety over the economy's condition.
   The Labor Department said consumer prices rose 0.8 percent in
August, pushed up by the energy price spiral set in motion when
Iraq seized Kuwait.
   The increase in the Consumer Price Index, which was within the
range of market estimates, was double the 0.4 percent rise in July
and the largest since January, when a severe cold snap pushed costs
up 1.1 percent.
   In a separate report, the Commerce Department said the U.S.
merchandise trade deficit jumped a dramatic 75 percent to $9.33
billion in July.
   ``I think we've had a whole series of economic
disappointments.,'' said Michael Metz, chief market analyst at
Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ``The question is whether the Fed opts to fight
inflation or fight a recession.''
   The Federal Reserve Board is widely believed to be weighing
whether to pump life into the economy by lowering interest rates.
   The central bank has indicated it would be inclined to relax its
monetary policy if White House and congressional negotiators agree
on ways to trim the budget deficit. Inflation considerations might
stay the Fed's hand, especially if the Middle East crisis drags on
and keeps oil prices rising.
   But a steep drop Tuesday afternoon in a key interest rate
influenced by the Fed sparked speculation that the central bank
already was easing.
   The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other on
overnight loans, fell to 6\ percent from around 8 percent recently.
The decline spurred buying enthusiasm for bonds, which spilled over
into the stock market.
   Rumors that Chase Manhattan was having trouble placing its
commercial paper temporarily unsettled the market, sending various
measures to session lows. Chase denied the rumors and said its
funding activities were running normally.
   Chase stock suffered anyway, sliding ~ to 15 on volume of more
than 1.58 million shares.
   UAL soared 7| to 105. The Wall Street Journal reported that a
group of United Airlines unions plans to meet with banks this week
to discuss a new offer for United's parent, UAL Corp. The newspaper
said the offer could amount to $175 a share to $180 a share.
   Among active blue chips, International Business Machines
advanced 2&lsqb; to 107\. But Primerica, another component of the Dow
Jones industrial average, tumbled 2| to 23&lsqb; amid talk about
possible weakness in the company's consumer finance operation.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $1.44 billion, or 0.05
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
0.26 to 174.88.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 0.88 to 376.71, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index increased 0.83 to 318.60.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slipped 1.90 to 372.21. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 319.69, off 2.02.

   Charles H. Keating, the man blamed by the
government for the nation's biggest savings and loan collapse, was
jailed in lieu of $5 million bail Tuesday after he was indicted on
criminal fraud charges.
   It was the first criminal case filed against Keating, who has
become a symbol of the national thrift scandal because of his high
pay, lavish personal habits, investments in risky real estate and
junk bonds, and alleged use of accounting gimmickry to conceal
wrongdoing.
   The former chairman of American Continental Corp. and three
other executives were charged in a 42-count state indictment with
selling securities by false statements or omissions, selling
securities without qualifications and lying to the California
Department of Corporations.
   The department approved the sale of the high-risk, high-yield
junk bonds, technically known as unsecured debentures, at branches
of the failed Lincoln Savings and Loan of Irvine, which Keating
controlled through American Continental.
   More than $200 million worth of junk bonds were sold to 22,000
investors, many of them elderly.
   ``I don't know how many bondholders are out there ... but
they're dancing in the street tonight. We'd like to get our money
back,'' bondholder Shirley Lampel said Monday after the district
attorney's office said it had completed its presentation to a
special state grand jury.
   The government seized control of Lincoln in April 1989.
Regulators estimate the bailout could cost taxpayers as much as $2
billion. Last month, a federal judge in Washington upheld the
government takeover of Lincoln, saying the operation of the thrift
by Keating and others ``amounted to looting.''
   Keating already is charged in several civil cases, including a
$1.1 billion racketeering case filed by the agency responsible for
the thrift bailout. The federal government is conducting a separate
criminal investigation into the alleged looting of Lincoln.
   The indictment was handed up late last week but kept sealed
until Tuesday. It focuses on 20 alleged victims, a case narrow
enough that Los Angeles District Attorney Ira Reiner said it could
be presented without confusing a jury.
   ``We could have named 22,000 victims,'' Reiner said. ``But that
would have created an unwieldy case that would have gone on forever
and a day.''
   The felony charges do not seek to recover money for the bond
buyers, but a judge could theoretically order restitution as part
of sentencing if Keating and the others are convicted, prosecutors
said.
   Keating, 66, a Phoenix developer, has contended that the
government has attempted to make a scapegoat out of him because he
was an outspoken critic of the thrift regulatory system. He
maintains the bondholders would never have lost money if the
government hadn't seized Lincoln last year and forced American
Continental into bankruptcy court.
   Also indicted were Judy Elizabeth Wischer, 42, of Paradise
Valley, Ariz., former president of American Continental; Ray
Charles Fidel, 32, of Newport Beach, former president of Lincoln;
and Robin Scott Symes, 37, of Malvern, Ohio, former chief executive
officer of Lincoln.
   All four appeared in Los Angeles County Superior Court but Judge
Gary Klousner postponed their arraignment to Oct. 5 because they
had not yet read the indictment.
   Klousner ordered all four held. Bail was set at $1 million
apiece for Wischer, Fidel and Symes.
   Five U.S. senators who received campaign contributions from
Keating are currently under investigation by the Senate Ethics
Committee. The ``Keating Five'' - Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., John Glenn, D-Ohio, and John McCain,
R-Ariz., and Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich. - helped arrange a
meeting between Keating and federal regulators during the time
before the savings and loan collapsed.
   Symes' attorney, Don Smaltz, called the bail amounts
``outrageous,'' saying they were motivated only by hysteria and
politics of the case.
   The judge said it appeared that if convicted ``the maximum
exposure of each defendant would be approximately 10 years'' in
prison.
   Keating has frequently said he is broke and that friends are
paying the mortgage on his Paradise Valley, Ariz., home.
   Reiner said the investigation revealed that elderly Lincoln
Savings investors were regularly steered into risky American
Continental securities when it came time to renew certificates of
deposits.
   ``They put their money in Lincoln Savings, they put their faith
in them,'' Reiner said. He declined to describe in detail how the
bonds were misrepresented.
   Asked what happened to the investors' money, Reiner said: ``The
money was transferred to American Continental and from there to Mr.
Keating.''
   The Department of Corporations has already sued Keating on
behalf of the investors. However, the bondholders themselves at one
point filed a claim against the department, saying it should never
have allowed the bonds to be sold in the Lincoln branches because
they ``constituted an extreme risk to the investing public.''

   General Motors Corp. will spend $4.2 billion to
protect employees' incomes but remains free to close factories
under a tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers union, a
newspaper reported.
   In an industry threatened by a sluggish economy and growing
foreign competition, the three-year pact reached after a weekend of
round-the-clock negotiations signaled to some the dawning of a new
era in U.S. automaking.
   ``We feel the spirit we developed during the negotiations bodes
well for General Motors, the customer and the marketplace,'' said
GM Vice President Alfred Warren.
   Many on the union side, too, were hopeful, even though details
of the three-year pact were delayed until Tuesday.
   ``I was kind of scared we were going to be off today, but since
we settled I'm glad,'' said J.D. Boatman, 61, a worker at GM's
Cadillac plant in Detroit.
   The last major strike was six years ago when the union struck
selected GM plants for a week.
   The Detroit Free Press reported in its Tuesday editions that the
agreement contains $4.2 billion in income guarantees, eliminates
weak plant-closing prohibitions from the previous agreement and
increases wages by 3 percent the first year.
   The agreement also provides for lump-sum payments equal to 3
percent of wages in the second and third years and increases
monthly pensions from $1,500 to $1,800 for workers who retire after
30 years, according to union and company officials who spoke to the
newspaper on the condition of anonymity.
   Health insurance provisions remain unchanged, the officials
said.
   The union and the No. 1 U.S. automaker negotiated well past the
midnight Friday expiration of the old contract and produced a
tentative settlement after 41 hours of nonstop talks.
   UAW President Owen Bieber said details of the agreement had to
be delayed until the information could get out to the 300,000
affected union members. The tentative settlement was announced
after 2 a.m.
   ``Therefore, we couldn't proceed without having the normal
material that we would provide for them before they made a decision
on the recommended agreement,'' he said.
   About 300 members of the UAW's GM bargaining council met
privately in suburban Dearborn Monday, but postponed review of the
agreement until Tuesday morning in Detroit.
   The absence of public posturing was conspicuous in these talks,
which were conducted under a news blackout in the final stages. But
GM and the UAW may need all the cordiality they can muster to get
through the next three years.
   GM faces the prospect of shrinking its number of factories -
many analysts believe it will have to close at least four assembly
plants - and reducing its hourly work force by tens of thousands of
people.
   Bieber told a predawn news conference he was ``very, very
satisfied'' with the agreement on pensions, and GM vice president
Alfred Warren said the contract gives the company latitude to
reduce its work force.
   Across the border in Canada, where the Canadian Auto Workers and
Ford Motor Co. have been negotiating a new contract, relations were
more strained. The CAW struck Ford's Canadian operation Saturday,
but electe not to break off talks after learning that the company
would offer a revised package Tuesday.
   CAW President Bob White had said if an offer was not
forthcoming, he would recess the talks on Wednesday. Ford spokesman
Jim Hartford said the offer would include new economic proposals.
   Because of the lack of details reported on the U.S. agreement,
it was difficult to tell what kind of effect the settlement would
have on the economy or on pending contract negotiations with Ford
and Chrysler Corp.
   GM common stock closed down 37{ cents to $37.12{ on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   The GM bargaining council, made up of union presidents and
bargaining committee chairs, will vote on the tentative pact before
it's sent to the rank and file for formal ratification. That
process is expected to be completed by the end of the month.
   If ratified, the contract will be used by the union as a model
for agreements with Ford and Chrysler. Union agreements with those
two companies, which cover more than 150,000 active workers, also
expired at midnight Friday. The union put talks with those
automakers on hold pending the outcome of the GM ratification vote.
   It was expected that Ford would have little trouble matching the
GM-UAW agreement. But there was a question for Chrysler, which is
in the worst financial shape of the Big Three and may report a loss
in the third quarter.
   The average hourly wage with cost of living adjustments for GM
workers is about $15.75 under the expired 1987 agreement. Fringe
benefits, particularly health care costs, boost that to nearly $30
per hour, the company has said.
   At Ford, the figure is about $31 per hour, and Chrysler's was
just more than $33.

   United Auto Workers union members expressed
relief Monday at news of a tentative agreement with General Motors
Corp., but many were anxious to learn if the union won more job
security.
   ``They're elated,'' Roger Smith, an alternate committeeman at
Local 22 in Detroit, said of members' reaction to the proposed
three-year contract reached early Monday. ``They're hoping our
president comes back and tells us we've got a good agreement.''
   Smith, a quality operator at GM's Cadillac plant and a 26-year
union member, is one of about 300,000 UAW-covered workers who
worried over the weekend about the negotiations. The 1987 agreement
expired at midnight Friday, but was extended while bargainers
worked on a new deal, details of which are to be announced Tuesday.
   UAW contracts at Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. also expired
at midnight Friday. The union targeted the No. 1 automaker to reach
a contract it could use as a pattern for pacts with Ford Motor Co.
and Chrysler Corp.
   After 41 hours of bargaining, UAW President Owen Bieber
announced at 2:10 a.m. Monday that negotiators had reached an
agreement.
   ``I was kind of scared we were going to be off today, but since
we settled I'm glad,'' said J.D. Boatman, 61, a worker at GM's
Cadillac plant in Detroit.
   The union's 300-member GM bargaining council met in suburban
Dearborn on Monday to get a look at the deal. But Bieber
rescheduled the meeting for Tuesday because copies of the lengthy
agreement still were being printed.
   If the contract is approved by the council, it will be sent to
rank-and-file members for ratification, a process expected to be
completed by the end of the month.
   Details haven't been officially announced, but The Detroit Free
Press reported in its Tuesday editions that the agreement contains
$4.2 billion in income guarantees, eliminates weak plant-closing
prohibitions from the previous agreement and increases wages by 3
percent the first year.
   The agreement also provides for lump-sum payments equal to 3
percent of wages in the second and third years and increases
monthly pensions from $1,500 to $1,800 for workers who retire after
30 years, according to union and company officials who spoke to the
newspaper on the condition of anonymity.
   Health insurance provisions remain unchanged, the officials
said.
   Local officials said Monday they were anxious to hear what gains
- if any - had been made.
   ``We're all starving for information over here,'' said Joe
Garcia, financial secretary for Local 645 in Van Nuys, Calif.. ``We
want to know what kind of job security they have to offer, what
kind of wage increases, what kind of pension increases, what kind
of incentives for people that want to retire.
   ``Those are just some of the questions that are floating in our
minds now waiting to be answered.''
   Paramount among the union's concerns was job security, an
emotional issue in an industry with a history of unexpectedly
severe layoffs.
   ``It's hard to send kids to college when you don't have a
paycheck,'' said Local 22 Vice President Frank Serazio, who has
seen his local's membership fall from almost 12,000 in 1978 to
5,200 in 1990.
   In 1987, the UAW built on job-security language introduced in
1984 which prohibited closing a factory unless its product or
products suffered a slump in sales.
   Since then, GM has closed four assembly plants - one each in
Atlanta; Framingham, Mass.; Leeds, Mo.; and Pontiac, Mich.
   UAW members have said they felt betrayed by the automaker. The
union challenged the closing of the Pontiac plant before an
arbitrator, but lost.
   Serazio said the 1987 ``plant-idling'' agreement - which has
allowed almost 9,000 layoffs - was stressed in this year's talks.
   Serazio added that union Vice President Stephen Yokich, the
UAW's top negotiator at GM, wouldn't let the UAW ``be entrapped in
terminology that not everybody has a clear idea on - like plant
idling.''
   Paul Mitchell, financial secretary of Local 645 in Lake Orion,
agreed.
   ``That really killed us in 1987,'' he said. ``The language
wasn't defined. So I would hope and pray that they did try to
redefine the meaning of different terms.''

<HEAD>Court Dismisses Antitrust Suit Against Comsat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Connecticut-based satellite company said
Tuesday it would appeal a federal court's dismissal of the firm's
$1.5 billion antitrust suit against Comsat Corp.
   Pan American Satellite said the suit was dismissed Thursday in
U.S. District Court in Manhattan on grounds that Comsat, a
congressionally created corporation, was immune from such antitrust
suits.
   Rene Anselmo, the chairman of Pan American, said ``It's just a
question of law ... I would expect we would prevail on appeal.''
   Pan American, based in Greenwich, Conn., filed suit in July
1989, charging Comsat with fixing prices and blocking competition
for international satellite communications services.
   Comsat, which stands for Communications Satellite Corp., sells
to U.S. companies access to Intelsat, the 117-nation consortium of
satellite telecommunications users.
   Pan American Satellite is the first privately owned
international satellite communications company.
   Anselmo established Pan American in 1984 after then-President
Reagan signed a presidential determination that it would be in the
national interest to allow so-called alternative satellite systems
such as PAS to compete with Comsat and Intelsat.
   Pan American launched its PAS-1 satellite in June 1988 and began
service in September to Latin America and Europe.
   Congress created Comsat in the Communications Satellite Act of
1962. Comsat is a private, publicly traded company that leases
Intelsat circuits to companies such as American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co., MCI, US Sprint and television networks.
   Pan American's suit sought $500 million in actual damages, which
would be tripled under federal law, and a permanent injunction
enjoining Comsat from engaging in alleged illegal activities.

<HEAD>Analysts Say Photo CD Good Development For Kodak</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILARY APPELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co.'s new photographic
compact disc system is a shrewd move to preserve the company's
traditional film market while taking advantage of new electronic
technologies, industry watchers said Tuesday.
   ``Concerns about the threat to Kodak from electronic imaging
will subside for a while,'' said Eugene Glazer, an analyst with
Dean Witter Reynolds.
   The Photo CD system, introduced Tuesday at news conferences in
New York, London, Tokyo and Rochester, is being developed jointly
with Dutch electronics company N.V. Philips. The system stores
photographic images from standard 35 millimeter film onto compact
discs, and the pictures can then be replayed on television screens.
   The system will be available in 1992, Kodak said.
   As was obvious at Kodak's product demonstration, photographs
taken on film are still far superior to those taken electronically.
   ``Nothing even remotely comes close to conventional film and
photo papers in terms of quality and price,'' said Barry Harrand,
director of marketing research for the Michigan-based Photo
Marketing Association.
   The Photo CD system is Kodak's first consumer product that
combines conventional picture-taking with the conveniences of
electronics, Glazer said. Investors have been concerned about the
threat posed to Kodak's basic silver-halide film business by new
technologies, he said.
   ``They've essentially successfully defended the role of silver
halide technology as the capture medium,'' said Mark Obenzinger, an
analyst with Trinity Trading Co.
   Most analysts said it was too early to predict how many people
will want to watch their photographs on television. There may be
more demand for the system's applications in desktop publishing,
said financial analyst Brenda Landry of New York's Morgan Stanley.
Kodak officials said the system could be made accessible to almost
any computer.
   ``It can make virtually any computer an electronic, full-color
photo editing workstation,'' said Larry Matteson, vice president
and general manager of Kodak's Imaging Information Systems.
   Obenzinger said the system is well-priced for both consumers and
photofinishers. Kodak estimated that the photo disc players, which
would also plays audio discs, would cost less than $500, while the
discs would cost less than $20.
   The photofinishing system, including a disc-writer, computer,
thermal printer, would cost about $100,000, Kodak said.
   A 1988 survey by the Photo Marketing Association showed that 57
percent of Americans would be interested in looking at their
photographs on television, Harrand said.
   Harrand said he expects to see all kinds of hybrid technologies
introduced onto the photographic market in the next few years.
   He said he expects such systems should expand the market for
photo sales as consumers gain more control over what they can do
with their photographs.

<HEAD>Corroon &amp; Black Rejects Aon Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corroon &amp; Black Corp. on Tuesday rejected an
unsolicited $840 million takeover bid from Aon Corp., saying it
would proceed with its proposed merger with fellow insurer Willis
Faber PLC of Britain.
   Corroon &amp; Black said the planned stock-swap merger ``will serve
the best interests of our shareholders, customers and employees.''
   Aon, the holding company for the brokerage Rollins Burdick
Hunter Group Inc., offered last week to buy Corroon &amp; Black for $40
a share in cash, or about $840 million.
   Under the approved agreement, Corroon &amp; Black stockholders would
receive 7.8 Willis Faber shares for each Corroon &amp; Black share, or
$33.49 at current market prices, in a deal valued at $754 million.
   Corroon &amp; Black shareholders are scheduled to vote on the merger
with Willis Faber on Sept. 28.
   Aon officials could not be reached for comment Tuesday evening
shortly after Corroon &amp; Black issued its response.
   Corroon &amp; Black stock closed at $35.50, down 37{ cents a share,
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Tuesday before the
company's announcement.
   Aon said last week it would not pursue a bid opposed by the
Corroon &amp; Black board.
   Noting that statement, Corroon &amp; Black said it ``has replied to
Aon Corp. that it wishes to consider the matter closed and proceed
with the merger with Willis Faber.''
   Insurance industry analysts expected Corroon &amp; Black to reject
Aon's offer, but they said Aon might come back with a higher bid.
   Corroon &amp; Black and Willis Faber are the world's fifth- and
sixth-largest insurance brokerages, respectively.
   Their tentative merger, announced in early June, would allow
both firms to expand in the other's home market and eventually move
into continental Europe and the Pacific Rim.
   The new firm, Britain-based Willis Corroon PLC, was expected to
have 1990 revenue of about $1 billion. It would create the world's
fourth-largest insurance brokerage in terms of revenue.
   Corroon &amp; Black has nearly all its business in the United
States, while Willis Faber gets about 80 percent of its revenue
from Britain. Corroon &amp; Black sold its 29.9 percent interest in the
British broker Minet Holdings PLC in February 1988.
   Aon has operations in the United States, Canada, Europe and the
Pacific. Besides Rollins Burdick, its subsidiaries include Combined
Insurance Co. of America and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Co.

<TEXT>
   Amdahl Corp., a maker of IBM-compatible
mainframe computers, announced a new line Tuesday it said includes
the most powerful computers ever for the IBM market.
   The top model of the 10-model line will include eight processors
- two more than International Business Machines Corp. says will be
in its next-generation mainframe due out next year.
   According to International Data Corp., a market research firm,
Amdahl's new top model will process about 332 million instructions
per second, or mips, a standard computer performance measurement.
   By contrast, IBM's new top model, announced Sept. 5, will run at
about 203 mips, IDC says.
   But IBM's new model will be available in the third quarter of
1991, while Amdahl's won't be ready until the second quarter of
1992, said Peter Burris, an IDC analyst.
   Amdahl said its new top-of-the-line model, priced at about $32
million, will be the first for the IBM market to use eight
processors, which are the ``brains'' of computers.
   The other maker of IBM-compatible mainframes, Hitachi Data
Systems Corp., announced its next-generation high-end model in
June. That four-processor machine, to be available next spring,
will run at about 150 mips, IDC says.
   Mainframe computers are used by large corporations to manage
hugh amounts of data, such as millions of customer accounts at an
insurance company or reservations at an airline.
   Since mainframes are so costly, companies must make long-range
plans for their purchase, Burris said. But he said Amdahl's
announcement of a top-end model that won't be ready for more than a
year and a half may be too much lead time.
   Amdahl, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., is 43 percent owned by
Japan's Fujitsu Ltd. Hitachi Data Systems is partially owned by
Hitachi Ltd., another Japanese electronics company.
   Hitachi and Amdahl traditionally undercut IBM's prices, and
their share of the U.S. mainframe market has grown while IBM's
slipped in recent years. But IBM still holds about 87 percent of
the U.S. high-end mainframe market, according to Computer
Intelligence, a La Jolla, Calif., research firm.

   The best companies for women offer child care
assistance and ``family-friendly'' leave policies, Working Mother
magazine said Tuesday in releasing its fifth annual roster of the
top employers for working mothers.
   The magazine didn't rank the companies from best to worst, but
cited 10 for exceptionally progressive policies: Apple Computer;
Boston's Beth Israel teaching hospital; Du Pont, the chemical
company; Fel-Pro, a supplier to the auto industry; HBO; IBM; Merck,
the drug maker; Morrison &amp; Foerster, a San Francisco law firm;
Procter &amp; Gamble, and SAS Institute, a computer software company.
   All 75 companies on the 1990 list offered some form of child
care program or assistance and long-term unpaid leaves with
benefits, some stretching up to three years, the magazine said its
in October issue.
   More than half provide child care either in or near the
workplace, 20 percent help with care for aging relatives, and a
growing number are offering paid paternity leaves of at least one
week.
   The latest list was expanded to 75 companies from the 60 a year
earlier and more than double the 30 companies that appeared in the
initial ranking published in 1986.
   Deputy Editor Susan Seliger said the expansion reflected the
increased number of companies that have grown sensitive to the
needs of the working mother, one of the fastest growing segments of
the American work force.
   ``These people see the writing on the wall, and it doesn't
matter if they're small or large,'' she said.
   The companies were evaluated on compensation, opportunities for
women to advance, support for child care and family-oriented
benefits such as parental leave, flexible working hours,
job-sharing and working at home.
   Among what the magazine called the more forward-looking programs
were IBM's commitment to spend $22 million on child care and $3
million on elderly care over the next five years; Du Pont's network
of child-care centers and a sick-care center near its Wilmington,
Del., headquarters; and Fel-Pro's in-home tutoring and $1,000 bond
for newborns.
   Other companies not on the top 10 also were singled out for
innovation. America West Airlines offers a 24-hour child care
center; Stride Rite, the children's shoe company, has established
what the magazine called the country's only intergenerational
center caring for both children and elderly relatives of employees;
and Lost Arrow, a maker of outdoor clothes, provides up to eight
weeks of paid paternity leave.
   The smallest company on the list, G.T. Water Products of
Moorpark, Calif., provides an on-site school for children of its 32
employees. Women hold three of the four top management positions at
the company, which makes drain cleaning products for the plumbing
industry.
   Seliger said the list was based on a survey of the benefits and
practices of hundreds of companies by author Milton Moskowitz and
researcher Carol Townsend, who also worked together on the book The
100 Best Companies to Work For in America.
   The magazine noted that the companies offering pro-family
benefits believe they are good for business.
   ``SAS Institute, which runs two 100 percent subsidized child
care centers, currently has a turnover rate of 7 percent, less than
one third the 24 percent average in the software industry,'' the
magazine said.
   It noted that the fastest growing segment of the work force was
mothers of chidren under the age of 6, according to government
figures. The magazine predicted that by 1995, two thirds of mothers
with preschoolers and three quarters of mothers with school-age
kids will be working.

<HEAD>Continental to Contribute to Eastern Pension Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines, Eastern's parent
company, on Tuesday agreed to immediately pay $80 million to an
Eastern pension plan underfunded by as much as $720 million, the
government said.
   Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. also agreed to shoulder most
of the future financial responsibility for the plan, the government
said.
   Under the settlement, Continental will pay $80.5 million to
cover part of a payment that had been due Monday to Eastern's
pension plan, said the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the federal
agency that guarantees pension payments.
   Eastern, now in the midst of bankruptcy proceedings, has also
agreed to pay $30 million by Jan. 15, the PBGC said.
   Continental has agreed to assume responsibility for about $600
million in remaining underfunded liabilities, less whatever amount
the PBGC gets back from its bankruptcy claims, the agency said.
   PBGC, which had faced a potential loss of nearly $720 million in
Eastern pension liabilities, said it would not suffer a loss under
the agreement. The deal provides full uninterrupted pension
benefits to Eastern's 51,000 workers and retirees, PBGC said.
   Under the plan, PBGC will terminate seven Eastern pension plans
and take over the plans.
   ``While we believed Continental could assume the yeoman's share
of the pension debt, in the interest of fairness and to prevent an
unreasonable risk that Continental could not afford the total
obligation, some payment was required from Eastern,'' Diane
Burkley, the PBGC's deputy executive director, said of the
agreement.
   Negotiators had been working on the matter for nine months, she
said.
   PBGC will establish a separate trust to hold pension assets and
to receive the Eastern and Continental payments. It is expected
that several of the plans will be funded within a couple of years
with the rest fully funded by the year 2002, the PBGC said.
   The agreement must be submitted to a federal bankruptcy court in
New York for approval. PBGC said it would terminate the pension
plans in October.

   A jubilant Steve Jobs on Tuesday showed off
new hardware and software for his Next computer, products he
predicted would boost his stalled company to the forefront of the
industry in the 1990s.
   About 2,000 Next Computer Inc. employees, users and industry
representatives cheered as the computer pioneer unveiled faster,
more powerful versions of Jobs' sleek black cube. They sported
floppy disks, built-in networking, color-and-video displays and
price tags starting at $4,995 - half that of the current model.
   Speaking on the same Davies Symphony Hall stage where he
announced the Next computer two years ago, Jobs also said more than
100 new applications would be shipped by the end of the year.
   ``This is the future of Next,'' Jobs said. ``We're going to show
you some of the neatest applications for any desktop platform . . .
the best color that's ever been.''
   The new products answer Next users and critics who complained
the Next workstation was too slow and too expensive and lacked a
floppy disk, color monitor or adequate software, Jobs said.
   Customers have listened, he said. The company got 15,000 orders
for the new hardware during a two-month period in which prospective
customers tested prototypes, Jobs said.
   ``If we can do that in 60 days - you can do the math,'' he
smiled.
   Jobs, who co-founded Apple Computer Inc. and led the development
of the Macintosh, introduced Next at a glitzy, standing-room-only
presentation in October 1988. The machine featured sharp graphics,
high-quality sound and built-in software making it easier to use
the system and write programs for it.
   Jobs called Next ``the best computer in the world'' and
predicted it would revolutionize personal computers. But it was a
year before shipments started, and sales have been slow.
   Because it is privately owned, Next is not obliged to disclose
earnings or sales, but International Data Corp., a high-tech
research firm, estimates that fewer than 7,000 Nexts were sold as
of June.
   Users and analysts who attended the presentation and product
fair said Jobs was moving in the right direction, particularly with
the combination of desirable features and a lower price.
   ``I think it is a very impressive machine. I think that the
pricing strategy has them at the right point. Five thousand
(dollars) with its capacity is pretty aggressive,'' said John
Nguyen, an analyst with Sutro &amp; Co. Inc. in San Francisco.
   The four new pieces of Next hardware are based on Motoroa's
68040 microprocessor, which Jobs said was at least three times
faster than the Motorola 68030 used in earlier models.
   The updated boxes also feature floppy disks as standard. The
originals stored data on a removable optical disk, which provided
greater capacity but were criticized as costlier and less flexible.
Optical disks are offered as an option on the new machines.
   Two models with black-and-white monitors - including the $4,995
Nextstation system - will be ready the first quarter of 1991. A
$7,995 color version and a $3,995 color board are expected to be
available in the first quarter of 1991.
   New software includes a new, more flexible spreadsheet by Lotus
Development Corp., creator of the popular 1-2-3 program. Unlike
earlier ones, the new application, dubbed Improv, enables users to
click a mouse to move about information and plain English formulas.
   Improv, $695, will be offered free to anyone who buys a new Next
product by the end of the year, Jim Manzi, Lotus' president and
chief executive officer.
   Other new software for Next includes programs by WordPerfect
Corp., which has about 70 percent of the word-processing market,
Adobe, SAS Institute, Imagine Inc., Sybase Inc. and Oracle.

   General Motors Corp. threw more than $4 billion
at the United Auto Workers to mollify labor and clear the way for
closing unprofitable plants under a three-year deal the union's
bargaining council approved Tuesday.
   The world's largest automaker will make the money available to
assure workers will be paid if they are laid off when plants close.
Analysts say such closings are inevitable if GM is to become more
competitive and regain market share lost to U.S. and foreign
rivals.
   The union made job security its top priority in this year's
talks, and said that objective was achieved in the talks with GM.
   ``Job security and income security go hand-in-hand when you make
the income security so high that they have got to make sure that
they're going to work on job security,'' UAW Vice President Stephen
Yokich said.
   GM closed four assembly plants in the last three years, putting
about 9,000 employees out of work. The 1987 contract language that
allowed the closings remains in the tentative agreement. This time,
GM will pay dearly to close a plant An affected worker:
   -May be laid off for no more than 36 weeks from a plant closed
because of slow sales of a product made there.
   -Would be paid 95 percent of base wages from a company-paid
supplemental employment benefits fund.
   -Must be recalled after 36 weeks or be placed in a JOBS bank,
also paid for by GM. The jobs may have nothing to do with the auto
industry. Workers could stay in the job bank for the life of the
contract.
   GM will spend $3.35 billion on the supplemental benefits fund
and the JOBS bank and $663 million on other income-protection
programs. The 300,000 UAW-represented workers will vote on the
contract over the next two weeks.
   ``It's a sweetened buyout based on the framework already in
place,'' said Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at the University
of California at San Diego. ``It gives GM a lot of flexibility.''
   The agreement also provides:
   -A 3 percent base wage increase in the first year and one-time
payments equal to 3 percent of annual salary in the second and
third years.
   -Continued cost-of-living adjustments.
   Union officials said an assembler who now makes $14.01 an hour
would receive $16.53 an hour under the new contract, counting both
the raise and cost-of-living increases based on an assumption of
4.4 percent annual inflation. Based on that assumption, the wage
would rise to $17.19 in the contract's second year and $17.88 the
third year.
   Bargaining Council members who received details in a three-hour
meeting Tuesday were largely impressed. The contract will fly with
the rank and file, they said.
   ``It's an OK contract,'' said Local 594 President Don Douglas,
an outspoken critic of UAW leadership.
   If GM shrinks as expected in the next three years, so will the
union.
   ``Here the UAW has achieved some measurable increase in job
security at the price of accepting the continued erosion in
employment levels,'' Shaiken said.
   Assuming approval of the agreement, the UAW will move onto Ford
Motor Co. or Chrysler Corp., where negotiations have been suspended
since Aug. 28 when the UAW picked GM as its bargaining target.
   The union probably would prefer to take the pattern to Ford
next, but that may depend on whether a Canadian Auto Workers strike
of Ford's operations there has been resolved. The strike reached a
fourth day Tuesday.
   ``I would think that unofficially we'd be next in the barrel,''
UAW-Ford Vice President Ernie Lofton said.
   Chrysler, in the worst financial shape of the Big Three, has
said it probably couldn't afford a contract tailored at GM or Ford.
   The No. 3 automaker has plenty of cash on hand from the sale of
subsidiaries and interest in other ventures, but it needs the money
to develop new cars and trucks. Buying out workers the way GM
agreed to could leave Chrysler cash-poor and with no new products.
   Bieber said he didn't know how much more this contract would
cost GM than the 1987 agreement. The income protection commitment
alone is three times greater than the last contract, however.
   ``Overall, its a good agreement, very solid,'' said Jerry
Melillo, president of UAW Local 1250 in Cleveland and a member of
the union's Ford bargaining committee.
   Ford's use of overtime to avoid building new plants in the 1980s
is targeted in the pattern agreement. The new contract would
provide for a 5-percent shift premium for some overtime work.
   ``That's pointed directly at Ford,'' Shaiken said. ``Those
overtime provisions are meant to establish a pattern.''
   Ford presented the CAW with a new economic package Tuesday, but
it was not favorably received.
   ``The best I can say is it forms a basis for continuing talks,
not a basis for settlement,'' CAW President Bob White said.

   Oil for October delivery dipped slightly in the
futures market Tuesday, as traders cashed in profits from the
record highs of a day earlier.
   The October contract closed down 22 cents at $33.41 per barrel
in the absence of major news from the Persian Gulf, which has
transfixed the oil market since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   Crude oil contracts for the next three delivery months were up
slightly, reflecting the market's attempt to narrow the range of
prices for oil delivered in the near term.
   ``It was sort of a day of consolidation,'' said Ed Kevelson, a
trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Among other petroleum products, home heating oil continued to
outpace unleaded gasoline because of seasonal fluctuations.
   Heating oil was up 1.12 cents to 86.43 cents per gallon on
October contracts, with other months also higher.
   Unleaded gasoline fell .06 cent to 91.61 cents per gallon for
October contracts, with November contracts down slightly and later
contracts higher.
   Natural gas rose to $1.560 cents per 1,000 cubic feet on October
contracts, up from $1.537 on Monday.
   After the markets closed, the American Petroleum Institute
reported that crude imports and the nation's crude stockpile had
both fallen last week.
   Crude imports dropped from to 6 million barrels per day from 6.9
million barrels per day for the week, falling below their level of

million barrels, from 374.3 million barrels a week earlier,
although the stocks were above the level of 329 million barrels a
year earlier, the trade group said in its weekly report.

from 211.1 million barrels a week earlier, but they were below the
level of 218.6 million barrels a year earlier.
   The stockpile of distillates, which includes heating oil, was up
to 133.3 million barrels, from 131.7 million barrels a week earlier
and 121.4 million barrels a year earlier. Distillate imports were
up to 394,000 barrels per day, from 242,000 barrels per day a week
earlier and 236,000 barrels per day a year earlier.
   The nation's refineries ran at higher capacity, 94 percent,
compared with 93.5 percent a week earlier and 89.9 percent a year
earlier, API said.

<BYLINE>BRIGHT IDEA: GE Expands In Eastern Europe With Light Bulb Venture</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   
   BUDAPEST, Hungary - As hammers and saws drone in the background,
George Varga spins his vision of how General Electric Co. will
increase its stake in the European lightbulb business while
benefiting from the newly opened markets of the East. The beachhead
is Tungsram, a light bulb company once owned by the government of
Hungary. GE bought control of Tungsram last November for $150
million in the largest U.S. investment in Hungary since World War
II, and it's Varga's job to turn things around.

   PONZANO VENETO, Italy - The Italian sportswear firm Benetton
Group SpA has grown from a small, family-owned business in a

<BYLINE>TAKING IT TO THE BANK: The Wild Ride of Silverado</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   
   DENVER - Silverado was a shooting star - a spectacular burnout
that left little but a sleek skyscraper in downtown Denver, a $1
billion bill for the taxpayers, and a raging controversy
surrounding one of its directors. The director is Neil Bush, son of
the president; this week, he faces hearings on government
allegations of a conflict of interest in the demise of the thrift.
But Silverado is more than the story of George's boy. It is a tale
of profligate spending and lending, of three-card monte played with
millions. It is, in fact, the savings and loan fiasco in
not-so-miniature.

Here's a place where you can find a replacement, an American

   PITTSBURGH - The manual on your fancy new home entertainment
system says to ``access the next highest programmed station
setting'' on the TV, but warns ``the audio could be muted'' with
improper handling. If you didn't understand the instructions to
change the channel, and press the right button or risk losing
sound, you're not alone. An English professor from Carnegie Mellon
University has come to the resuce of the growing ranks of
``techno-dolts,'' those of us who have trouble setting VCR clocks
or taping programs.
