   A man who appeared to be drunk walked into
a college cafeteria and opened fire with a revolver Friday, killing
one woman and wounding another, authorities said.
   The attack at Carroll College came three days after a student at
Montana State University killed two people with a shotgun at the
campus in Bozeman, 90 miles from here.
   A man believed to be an unemployed ranch hand without any
connection to Carroll College was arrested in Friday's attack.
Darrell Randall Stahl, 36, was arrested on the campus of the small
Roman Catholic college half an hour after the shooting, said County
Attorney Mike McGrath.
   A first court appearance for Stahl was canceled because he
appeared intoxicated, McGrath said. Authorities were considering
murder and attempted murder charges, he said.
   The assailant ``entered the east door of the Carroll Commons,
walked to a group of Carroll employees who were having a coffee
break _ food service employees _ asked them a question about where
he could find somebody, and then proceeded to shoot the two
individuals,'' said Russ Ritter, vice president for development at
Carroll.
   The dead woman, identified by hospital authorities as Sharon
Hance, 52, was a college secretary, Ritter said.
   The wounded woman was a food service worker for Marriott Foods,
which runs the cafeteria. The woman, whose name was withheld, was
in stable condition at St. Peter's Community Hospital, said Loretta
Lindell, hospital spokeswoman.
   On Tuesday, a 19-year-old Montana State Universith student is
accused of killing two freshmen in a dormitory with a shotgun.
Authorities say the alleged attacker apparently didn't know the
victims, and have been unable to say what the motive was.
   MSU student Brett Byers was held without bond on two murder
charges in that case.
   Asked if the Montana State attack had somehow triggered Friday's
shooting, Assistant Police Chief Michael Bloom said: ``Knowing
human nature, history tells us it's possible.''
   Bloom refused to comment on whether Stahl knew the women or
whether the shooting appeared to be random. He said no motive has
been determined, but that police were interviewing a woman who may
have been with Stahl before the shooting.

   A district court has banned an
Albanian youth newspaper in a southern province that has been torn
by ethnic strife, a newspaper reported today.
   Politika, a Belgrade daily, said the court took the action
Thursday because of ``a series of unacceptable articles, including
a text headlined ``Kosovo is not Serbia,''' and interviews with
dissidents.
   The court in the capital of Kosovo province, Pristina, also
imposed the ban because the Albanian-language paper published
photos of defendants at a trial in the Kosovo town of Titova
Mitrovica.
   The defendants, all prominent ethnic Albanians, were acquitted
last month. The southern province of Kosovo is nominally
autonomous, but Serbia has some administrative control over it.
   Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population,
are fighting for more autonomy. Serbian officials say they want to
maintain control to protect the province's Serbian minority from
Albanian harassment.

<HEAD>British Ambassador Returns to Baghdad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Ambassador Harold Walker has
returned to Iraq two months after his recall to Britain in protest
of the execution of London-based journalist Farzad Bazoft.
   A British diplomat expressed hope Walker's return Thursday would
help improve ties, strained by the Bazoft case and British charges
that Iraq tried to import nuclear-bomb triggers and parts for a
giant gun.
   ``His return is evidence of the British government's desire to
rebuild dialogue with Iraq and try to solve some of the outstanding
problems between the two countries,'' said the diplomat, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Walker returned to Baghdad in time for an anticipated summit of
Arab leaders at the end of this month, which will discuss, among
other things, a campaign of ``threats to Iraq's security.''
   Iraq and other Arab countries have said that the British and
Western arms allegations against Iraq are a plot to deprive it of
advanced technology and pave the way for an Israeli attack on Iraqi
factories.
   The British Embassy in Baghdad has been the site of virtually
daily demonstrations by Iraqis, and Arabs invited by the Iraqi
government, denouncing the British position.
   Analysts here said the decision to send Walker back was prompted
in part by the imminent Arab summit, which is expected to be asked
to take a unified position against the ``anti-Iraqi'' British and
Western stand.
   Bazoft, an Iranian-born reporter for the weekly Observer of
London who traveled on British papers, was executed March 15 on
charges he was an Israeli spy.
   He was arrested after visiting the area of an Iraqi
military-industrial complex where he was investigating reports of
deaths and injuries in an explosion at the site.
   Iraqi authorities said Bazoft was using his job as a journalist
as a cover for espionage. His newspaper vehemently denied he was a
spy and said an alleged confession was extracted under duress.

<HEAD>Roast Warthog, Crocodile Tail: This Cuisine's a Walk on the Wild
Side</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LANEY SALISBURY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boiled elephant trunk has not been a big
hit. But crocodile tail, roasted warthog and hippo burgers are
being snapped up by tourists on the African circuit who want a menu
as exotic as the surroundings.
   ``Tourists like to return home and boast they ate a crocodile.
It's better than the other way around,'' says Jan de Haast, a
director of Zimbabwe's Sun Hotel chain.
   Ever sensitive to tourist appetites _ and the revenues they
generate _ hotels, safari lodges and bush camps are heeding the
call of the wild when it comes to cuisine.
   Hungry for a little snack? Safari guide Garth Thompson of Harare
suggests flying ants fried in fat from their own oily wings. ``Just
like popcorn,'' he says.
   Quelea, a native bird smaller than a quail, makes a nice
casserole, as do field mice, according to Thompson. If that's not
enough to make the mouth water, there are the succulent
caterpillars found on the indigenous mopani tree. Best when fresh,
Thompson says, but just fine sun-dried.
   He also recommends spicing up the local cornmeal staple, a
porridge known as sadza, with grasshopper gravy.
   Then there's Marc Cosyns, the Belgian-born head chef at Harare's
Sheraton Hotel. Listing his menu offerings, he sounds like a cross
between Julia Child and ``Wild Kingdom.''
   His roast warthog, he says a bit immodestly, is very nice
indeed. ``The legs, roasted with mint or apple sauce, are
particularly good,'' he says.
   Not every wild food idea works out.
   Elephant trunk, hotelier de Haast concedes regretfully, presents
problems even for the most resourceful of chefs.
   For one thing, the average six-foot trunk is tough and muscular,
takes six hours to boil and frankly isn't all that tasty. For
another, few diners want to confront a pair of nostrils on their
plate.
   ``It just looks too unappetizing,'' says de Haast. ``The idea
was doomed from the beginning.''
   One menu standard is African antelope, such as kudu and eland.
The flavor is similar to that of venison.
   ``Game meat needs only simple preparation to bring out its
delicate taste,'' says Cosyns. ``It can be tough, so you marinate
it first and eat it with a sauce, like garlic, mint, bernaise or
marsala.''
   Little of the exotic food served up to tourists is actually
killed in the wild, however. Much of it is farm-bred.
   John White, a top official of the Harare-based Wildlife
Producers Association, says the association's 460 members try to to
conserve wildlife by breeding species like zebra, waterbuck and
white rhinoceros for food, hunting or game viewing.
   Most game dishes sell for about the same price as ordinary fare,
although crocodile is a bit more expensive. It's much in demand,
though.
   The pinkish-white meat, from the tails of young crocodiles,
tastes a little like lobster. Or maybe chicken. Anyway, it can be
grilled, broiled or smoked and served with wild mushroom sauce,
cornmeal patties or rice.
   Such offerings are more popular with visitors than locals.
Zimbabweans rarely eat game meat because of traditional African
totem worship, known as ``mutopo.'' Many wild animals are depicted
in totem symbols.
   But ``biltong'' _ a kind of jerky consisting of sun-dried,
salted and spiced impala _ is a popular snack throughout eastern
and southern Africa.
   If all this sounds a little unappetizing, Harare writer Sam
Munyavi says, consider some of the icons of French cuisine.
Escargot. Frog's legs.
   ``One man's meat is another man's poison,'' Munyavi says.
``Frogs _ yech.''

<TEXT>
   Christian Brando, son of Marlon Brando and
his first wife Anna Kashfi, was a child of turbulence from his
earliest years.
   On Thursday, the younger Brando, 32, was booked for
investigation of murder after a man identified as Dag Drollet, 26,
was shot to death at the Brando estate.
   According to authorities, Christian Brando admitted shooting
Drollet, described as a boyfriend of Brando's pregnant sister,
Tarita Cheyenne Brando, but said he fired the gun because of the
way Drollet was treating her.
   Christian Brando is the son of the actor and Anna Kashfi, an
exotic-looking actress who played an Indian girl in ``The
Mountain,'' starring Spencer Tracy. Brando, whose passion for
foreign beauties became legendary, wooed the girl who claimed to be
the daughter of an Indian, Devi Kashfi.
   Then came reports from England that although she had been born
in Calcutta, her real name was Joan O'Callaghan, and she had an
Irish father and French mother.
   Anna became pregnant, and Brando married her in 1957. They
separated the next year and were divorced in 1960. Later he
testified that he married her ``with the primary purpose of getting
a divorce within a year.''
   Miss Kashfi was granted custody of Christian, but in 1965
custody was withdrawn because, a judge decreed, ``Miss Kashfi's
reliance on drugs and alcohol contributed to her uncontrollable
temper.''
   Many of her outbursts against her ex-husband resulted in
violence, witnessed by their son. The court said Christian, then 6,
would live with Marlon's older sister.
   Brando next married Mexican actress Movita, who had appeared
opposite Clark Gable in the 1935 ``Mutiny on the Bounty.'' He later
said the marriage was for the purpose of giving a name to their
son, Miko, and the pair never lived together after his birth.
   In 1960 Brando was cast in the Gable role of a remake of
``Mutiny on the Bounty.'' His leading lady was Tarita, a Tahitian
beauty, with whom he had two children, Simon Teihotu and Tarita
Cheyenne. Brando and Tarita were later married.
   Anna Kashfi continued her struggle to regain custody of
Christian. In 1973 she accused Brando of spiriting Christian out of
the country to avoid her lawsuit.
   ``My son has been subjected to ridicule and embarrassment over
the performance of his father,'' she declared, referring to the
X-rated ``Last Tango in Paris.'' Her suit claimed he had played ``a
sexually maladjusted and perverted person.''
   Finally in 1974, Miss Kashfi canceled her lawsuit, saying that
her ex-husband had cooperated in visitation rights. Christian, then
13, grew up under his father's supervision, attending private
schools and keeping out of the spotlight, in keeping with Brando's
tradition.
   Little is known about Christian's adult life, but he was
reported to be employed for a time as a tree surgeon and most
recently worked as a welder.

<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested two men Thursday night
in the shooting deaths of four men during a police-style raid
Monday on a high-stakes dice game at a lounge, authorities said.
   Officers acting on tips from informants arrested Paul Miller,
22, at an auto repair shop and his 19-year-old brother, Timothy, as
the younger brother walked along a street near downtown, police
said.
   At least one more suspect was still being sought in the slayings
at the Glass Key Cafe, said police Capt. Randy Ely.
   Police raided two homes on the same block in search of the
Millers and found a number of weapons, but made no other arrests in
the shootings, officials said. It was not yet known whether any of
the weapons had been used in the slayings.
   Early Monday, men wearing ski masks and camouflage clothing and
armed with automatic weapons broke into the game at the Glass Key,
shouting ``Task force!'' Four men were shot to death and three
other people were wounded, one critically.
   There may have been up to $400,000 on the table when the robbery
occurred, Ely said earlier. One of those killed, Robert ``Austin''
Satterwhite, 30, had $60,000 in his pocket.
   Investigators believe the motive was robbery, but are also
considering the possibility of a ``hit'' on one of the dice players
or a narcotics connection, Ely said.
   He would not confirm witness' reports that the gunmen yelled
``Get Austin!'' as they broke into the game, but did say the
attackers called at least two players by name, Ely said.
   Killed along with Satterwhite, who was from Austin, were Fort
Worth residents James Lacey, 56; Joe Wafers, 54; and Timothy V.
Carter, 45.
   Among the wounded, only Earl Edwards Jr. remained hospitalized
Thursday night. He was listed in serious condition at John Peter
Smith Hospital.
   Investigators have not talked to all the people believed to be
in the ``inner circle'' of players in the game, police said. Some
gamblers, as well as others who were in the lounge, are beleived to
have fled before police arrived.
   The lounge was a longtime problem, police have said. Officers
were dispatched to the club 344 times and 67 arrests were made
there during 1989.
   The lounge's owner, Albert Huey-You, was among the wounded.
Huey-You, who said his ear was nicked by a shotgun pellet, has
decided to close the 45-year-old business, his daughter Stephany
Huey-You said Wednesday.

<DATELINE>CANNES, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Eastern European filmmakers on
their first pilgrimage to Cannes is getting a close-up look at the
glitter and hype that surround a major Western film festival.
   ``It's an amazing spectacle,'' said Soviet director Pavel
Lunghin. His first film, ``Taxi Blues,'' is contending for the top
award, the Golden Palm.
   ``My only problem is renting a tuxedo,'' said Lunghin. ``It will
make me look ridiculous.''
   Amid the spectacle of Cannes, his self-consciousness seems
misplaced.
   During the 12-day festival ending Monday, Cannes' normal
population of 72,000 has swelled by an least 25,000.
   The visitors include powerful producers, glamorous stars and
dedicated fans.
   The sights and sounds of the festival can be astonishing in
their contrasts: Arnold Schwarzenegger is mobbed by paparazzi as he
tangos at poolside with Sylvester Stallone. Gypsies beg in front of
posh cafes.
   Street performers strut in silver Robocop costumes, ambling
musicians and kids selling roses compete for attention and francs
along the sidewalks.
   Dozens of films are shown daily in the mammoth harborside Palais
des Festivals, including at least two entries in competition for
the Golden Palm. Each evening, crowds gather to salute their
favorite stars in evening dress entering the daily gala film
showing. An elaborate dinner usually follows in a tent behind the
palace.
   Among those making appearances recently were Lauren Bacall,
Anthony Quinn, Grace Jones and Dennis Quaid. Actress Anjelica
Huston, daughter of late American director John Huston, is on the
10-member jury of the festival, headed by Italian director Bernardo
Bertolucci.
   The stars are well-protected from pickpockets and other trouble.
Police chief Jean-Jacques Moniez has doubled the city's force to
600 in anticipation of anything from petty crime to bomb threats.
The festival palace itself is searched every morning for explosives.
   Hotel rooms are scarce. Many journalists and film professionals
make do with accommodations that few vacationers would tolerate.
   Innkeepers swear prices don't rise for the festival. But with a
vodka-tonic costing about $11 at a top hotel terrace, one wonders.
   Almost everywhere, there is speculation about who will win
prizes.
   In the case of several of the 18 Eastern European films at the
festival, including ``The Interrogation'' from Poland and ``The
Ear'' from Czechoslovakia, Western viewers were able to see works
that had been made many years ago.
   Under the now-ousted Communist regimes, the films circulated
privately and developed cult status.
   One Soviet film, ``Matj,'' which means mother, is a three-hour,
20-minute epic based on a Maxim Gorky novel. A co-production with
Soviet and Italian companies, directed by Gleb Panfilov, it
revolves around a young man who joins a socialist group during
Czarist times, is imprisoned and tried for his subversive acts.
   Panfilov told a news conference that he started to think about
the film before Soviet reforms, but was glad that the new openness
enabled him to make it the way he wanted to.
   He said the reforms have led to more Soviet film-making.
   ``We've gone from 150 films a year to 300 in the past two
years,'' he said. ``However, quantity doesn't guarantee quality.''

<HEAD>City's Biggest Crack Seizure Was Mostly Wax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Counterfeit crack cocaine made to fool
unwary street buyers also suckered police, who heralded a 12-pound
seizure of wax as the city's largest drug haul.
   After the March 21 raid, Sheriff Jim McMillan said the seizure
was worth more than $250,000. But only four grams of cocaine were
found in the suspected crack, police said Wednesday.
   The actual value of the cocaine was about $400, said Assistant
State Attorney John Merrett.
   Tests revealed the cache contained 0.14 to 0.17 of an ounce of
cocaine, but police said the substance was still dangerous.
   ``People will kill each other over one fake rock,'' said police
Lt. David Sembach.
   The wax had been mixed with benzocaine, a topical anesthetic,
said police Capt. Herschell Connell. Users would have had a hard
time smoking the mixture because the wax would have melted. The
benzocaine could have caused respiratory failure if inhaled.
   Drug charges still stand against two people arrested in the
raid, Merrett said. They are Glenn Schofield, 32, charged with
armed possession of cocaine, and Patricia Ann Reese, 41, charged
with possession of marijuana.

Picks up 4th graf pvs, `Matloubi entered...'
^By TIM DAHLBERG</NOTE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iranian accountant now living in England
came back from the brink of disaster twice Thursday to outlast a
Reno, Nev., poker player and win the $835,000 first prize in the
World Series of Poker.
   Mansour Matloubi used an anti-climatic pair of sixes on the
final hand to top a pair of fours held by Hans ``Tuna'' Lund and
win the final Texas Hold'Em event in the competition that crowns
the world's poker champion.
   The final hand win capped a remarkable comeback that saw
Matloubi, playing in his first championship game, twice draw the
card he needed to stay in the game on the final draw after he had
each time put all his chips into the pot.
   ``I was dead,'' Matloubi said. ``But when the chips went in
every time I had the best hand.''
   Lund had appeared to have the edge after 192 of the players who
put in $10,000 apiece to enter the event had lost their chips and
only he and Matloubi were left to go head-to-head.
   Matloubi trailed by about $300,000 in chips, but the turning
point came when he put all his chips in and he and Lund were
suddenly playing one hand for a $1.6 million pot.
   With only one of the five ``flop'' cards left to be turned over,
Lund appeared to be on his way to the title with a pair of aces to
Matloubi's pair of 10s.
   But the last card was a 10, and Matloubi was not only still in
the game, he held a commanding lead that he used to whittle Lund
down until the final pair won the marathon contest.
   ``I never thought I would win it,'' said the 37-year-old
champion. ``I came here basically with the intention of only
playing in the cash games, not this game.''
   Matloubi, who left Iran in 1972, was an accountant in Wales
before a love for poker prompted him to turn into a professional
player about three years ago.
   It was his first time in the poker series, and only his second
trip to Las Vegas.
   Lund, 39, received $334,000 for finishing second.
   Matloubi entered Thursday's final round with $403,000 in chips,
the most among nine players making it to the final cut in the
annual poker classic at Binion's Horseshoe in downtown Las Vegas.
   Lund entered Thursday's final round in eighth place in money
rankings with $170,000 in chips.
   The remaining seven players were eliminated throughout the day
Thursday.
   Dave Crunkleton, 56, a salesman from Dallas, N.C., finished
third, winning $167,000.
   Jim Ward, 43, Anchorage, Alaska, was fourth with $91,850,
followed by 1986 world champion Berry Johnson, 54, Oklahoma City,
with $75,150; and Al Krux, 46, Syracuse, N.Y., with $58,450.
   Rod Peate, 42, Portland, Ore. finished seventh with $50,100 in
prize money. John Bonetti, 61, Houston, Texas, finished eighth,
winning $33,400.
   Two-time world poker champion Stu Ungar, 36, of New York City
was the first of the final nine to be eliminated Thursday. He
finished with $25,050 in prize money.
   The record field of 194 players anted $10,000 each to enter the
final event.
   The annual tournament began April 27, with more than 3,000
players competing in a series of events leading up to this week's
finale.

<HEAD>Well-to-Do Adopting Couples Turn To Heartland For Babies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN HAUK ESSEX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Along with corn, wheat and pork, Iowa is
exporting infants _ to affluent couples from the coasts seeking
``country fresh'' babies from the heartland, adoption officials say.
   ``People in California and New York think of Iowa as a field of
babies waiting to be reaped,'' said Nancy Lee Ziese, adoption
supervisor for Hillcrest Family Services, a private agency in Cedar
Rapids. ``They think no one here does drugs _ we're all the
farmer's daughter.''
   Scores of advertisements seeking a ``healthy, white infant''
appear in the personal columns of Iowa newspapers every week.
Adoption officials in the state say the ads, used to arrange direct
contacts between wealthy couples and natural mothers, deprive less
well-heeled Iowans of adoption opportunities.
   The ads, directed at mothers, promise to ``ease your heartache
... through this difficult time'' and offer a life ``with much
love, warmth,'' and ``laughter and a lifetime of opportunities.''
   They tender ``a happily married couple,'' ``stable values'' and
a ``secure home'' with a ``large yard.''
   The ads allow would-be parents to bypass stringent adoption
regulations and increase their odds of success. According to the
National Committee for Adoption, in a given year 2 million
applicants are seeking 25,000 available infants.
   Marg Corkery, adoption program manager for the Iowa Department
of Human Services, said her agency tells out-of-state couples ``we
have people waiting in line right here in Iowa.''
   But the agency has no control over independent adoptions
arranged through advertisements, and state figures show up to 500
children have been adopted in the last six years by parents
completing the legal work out of state.
   Andrea Charlow, a professor who teaches family law at Drake
University in Des Moines, thinks prospective parents see Iowa as a
source of ``country fresh farm girls and farm babies.''
   People are turning to Iowa because of their desire for white
babies, she said. Because 97.5 percent of Iowa residents are white,
``the chances are if someone answers your ad, it would be a white
person,'' Charlow said.
   ``I think that's terrible. A baby is not a commodity for sale,''
Corkery said.
   Mary Beth Seader of the National Committee for Adoption agreed:
``Advertising makes children a commodity. It devalues them.''
   Seader said couples can find ``how-to'' books on adoption, with
suggestions on placing ads or searching high schools and shopping
malls for young pregnant women.
   ``The Private Adoption Handbook'' by Stanley B. Michelman and
Meg Schneider, tells prospective parents how to word advertisements
and lists newspapers that accept adoption ads.
   Newspapers in other states carry such ads. For example, nine of
the 11 entries in the personals section of the April 16 Omaha
(Neb.) World Herald were adoption ads.
   Michael Goldstein, a New York City lawyer who has handled
adoptions of Iowa-born children for clients, said adoption by ad
gives a pregnant woman control of who rears her child, allows her
and the adoptive parents a chance to set the adoption terms and
speeds the process.
   His clients have waited an average of five to six months between
placing an ad and bringing home a baby, said Goldstein, who is paid
an average of $3,500.
   Corkery said the average waiting time for couples at her agency
is five to eight years, with no fee. Private agencies in Iowa cited
average fees of $5,000, with waiting periods of two months to
several years for healthy infants.
   Goldstein, who has three adopted children, likes the flexibility
of private one-on-one adoption.
   ``The birth parent can meet with the adoptive parent if they
choose that. They're able to have an adoptive parent present at
birth if they want to go that far,'' Goldstein said.
   He said mothers also can be assured their children will not be
placed in foster care while the adoption clears the courts. Private
agencies said temporary foster arrangements can last several weeks
to a year.
   ``Birth mothers have rejected the agencies,'' Goldstein said.
``They don't give the mothers the options that birth mothers are
looking for.''

<HEAD>Pentagon: No 3 Percent Budget Target for NATO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States, in a bow to the lessened
threat of war in Europe, is dropping its longstanding but rarely
met demand that NATO allies hike defense budgets by 3 percent a
year above inflation.
   The decision is expected to be ratified next week at a meeting
of NATO defense ministers in Brussels, Pentagon sources said
Thursday.
   ``Europe is being transformed,'' said the senior official, who
spoke of the decision on condition of anonymity. ``Basically, it's
a statement of reality.''
   Few countries met the target in recent years, given the shift
toward improved relations with the Soviet Union adopted by many
Western European democracies, even before the fall of the Berlin
Wall in November 1989.
   The policy reversal comes as North Atlantic Treaty Organization
members begin a major review of the pact's military and political
strategy in light of the evaporation of its longtime foe, the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   President Bush called for the reassessment when he suggested a
meeting of NATO leaders, which will be held in London during the
first week of July.
   NATO defense and foreign ministers have scheduled a series of
meetings to prepare for the summit and evaluate the alliance's
strategy, as well as its conventional and nuclear weapons policies.
   Although the decision to drop the budget target apparently was
being readied for announcement at next week's meeting in Brussels,
the Pentagon released the information in a written statement
Thursday afternoon in response to a reporter's query.
   ``Given the changes in European security requirements, we are no
longer asking our allies to increase their defense budgets by 3
percent,'' the statement said.
   Instead of meeting the longstanding spending target, the
statement said, the United States is asking that the allies
``contribute to the military force structure required by the NATO
military command.''
   The spending target, stated in terms of real or
inflation-adjusted spending, was set under President Carter in
1977, primarily in response to congressional demands that the
wealthy nations of Europe take up more of the burden of their own
defense.
   From 1980 through 1986, growth in real U.S. defense outlays
exceeded 3 percent each year, peaking at a 9 percent increase from
1984 to 1985. But since then there has been little growth, and
outlays are expected to decline by 6 percent in real terms this
year.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has projected a 2 percent annual
decline through the mid-1990s, and many influential congressional
figures have called for much steeper declines.
   A Pentagon study released last month showed that only six NATO
nations _ Denmark, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and Turkey _
boosted their spending in 1988 by 3 percent or more.
   The same review showed that besides the United States, only four
of the 15 members of NATO's military alliance _ Canada, Luxembourg,
Norway and Spain _ met or exceeded the 3 percent goal on average
for the 1978-1989 period. In that period U.S. defense spending grew
by about 5 percent per year, averaging the large pre-1986 increases
with the near-stagnation after 1986.
   Even though the Pentagon made the announcement outside the
normal NATO setting, defense officials who insisted on anonymity
insisted the decision was an alliance one.
   Normally, the alliance takes great pains to portray its
decision-making as taking place amid much consultation.
   One Pentagon source said the last formal reference to the 3
percent target was made at last spring's defense ministers' session
in Brussels, the NATO headquarters.
   Following that meeting, the allies decided to review their
security requirements, and the 3 percent goal was scheduled for
review at the next defense ministers' meeting in Brussels next
Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said he believed the United States had not expected its
allies to meet the 3 percent goal since 1981, when Ronald Reagan
became president. The decision is ``not hot news,'' he said.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., ranking minority member of the
committee, said the decision was a ``very pragmatic move in light
of receding threat of the Warsaw Pact.''
   Cheney has argued repeatedly that the United States cannot allow
its defense budget to fall precipitously amid the changes in the
Soviet Union and Europe, warning that the move toward more liberal
systems could be reversed.
   Only last month, Cheney's annual report to Congress assessing
the defense spending of NATO nations and Japan faulted Luxembourg,
Denmark and Canada for ``below par'' contributions to the common
defense.
   ``These nations have, by and large, relatively prosperous
economies and relatively high standards of living, yet devote
relatively small proportions of their resources to defense,'' the
report complained.

   A three-judge federal panel on Thursday
upheld the authority of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine the level of discharges from a Missouri River reservoir
in South Dakota and North Dakota.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel overturned a lower
court order that releases from the Oahe reservoir be reduced, as
had been requested by the drought-stricken states.
   The appeals panel said it had serious reservations about whether
courts have jurisdiction over such decisions by the corps. In a
brief order, the panel said it would spell out its legal reasoning
later in a formal opinion.
   The tug-of-war over water rights pitted the corps and the states
of Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas and Missouri against North Dakota, South
Dakota and Montana over whether water flow should be reduced from
the reservoir, which stretches from Pierre, S.D., to near Bismarck,
N.D.
   U.S. District Judge Patrick Conmy in Bismarck had ordered the
corps to reduce the discharges by one-third until June 1 so the
hatch of walleye pike could be completed in the 232-mile long
reservoir. The appeals panel granted an emergency stay of that
order last Friday.
   The corps said the lower water level would threaten barge
traffic between Sioux City, Iowa, and St. Louis, a 730-mile
shipping channel, and also would jeopardize two species of birds
protected by the Endangered Species Act.
   State officials on both sides of the issue said they were not
surprised by the ruling.
   ``It was expected, anticipated that the judges would rule in our
favor. But nonetheless it is good news,'' said Nebraska Gov. Kay
Orr in Omaha, Neb.
   ``The downstream states have to protect our interests from the
states upstream,'' she said.
   North Dakota Attorney General Nicholas Spaeth, who argued the
case Wednesday before the panel, said in Bismarck that there
probably isn't time to appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``We don't have many options,'' said Spaeth. ``It'll be almost
impossible to get Supreme Court review in the two weeks we have
left.''
   North Dakota Gov. George Sinner, speaking from Washington, D.C.,
expressed strong disappointment with the ruling.
   ``The upper basin states have continued to give and give and
give. We gave up huge amounts of our most fertile land for flood
protection for the lower basin states,'' he said. ``Now we're being
asked to give up recreation for the lower basin navigation.
   ``It's patently unfair and we will seek every avenue that we can
to get restitution for our people,'' Sinner added.
   Despite the defeat, South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson said in
Sioux Falls, S D., ``it was a battle that had to be fought.''

<HEAD>House Approves AIDS Amendment to Disabled Rights Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hopes of easy congressional passage of major
civil rights legislation for the disabled faded on a House vote
that critics say shows the triumph of fear over fact about AIDS.
   By a 199-187 vote, the House approved an amendment Thursday that
lets employers reassign workers with ``contagious diseases'' to
prevent them from handling food.
   The vote came despite last-minute opposition to the amendment by
the Bush administration. Both sides agreed during debate that the
amendment refers mainly to people with AIDS, which spreads through
sexual contact or other exchange of bodily fluids, or by sharing
hypodermic needles.
   Even supporters of the amendment said they were responding to
what they believed were public misconceptions about AIDS, and not
what medical evidence has shown: that casual contact does not
spread the disease.
   ``Perception is reality,'' said Rep. Charles G. Douglas III,
R-N.H. ``We run election campaigns on perceptions. It's reality to
our voters.''
   Douglas had introduced the amendment to the Americans With
Disabilities Act in the House Judiciary Committee, where it was
defeated. Rep. Jim Chapman Jr., D-Texas, offered it on the House
floor.
   Approval of the amendment means the bill must go to a conference
committee to be reconciled with a Senate-passed version. Backers
had expected to avoid that because the House and Senate versions
were nearly identical.
   Douglas said restaurateurs know the medical truth about AIDS,
but don't trust their customers.
   ``We understand that you can't get AIDS because the cook cuts
his finger and bleeds into the roast beef when he's preparing it,''
he said. ``But the customers out there may not buy that. And when
they all leave and the restaurant goes out of business, what have
you done for the restaurants of America? Now you've put everybody
that works there out of business.''
   The amendment was sought by the National Restaurant Association
and the National Federation of Independent Business.
   Opponents of the amendment argued that the same logic was used
to fight equal employment opportunity for blacks a quarter-century
ago. Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., chief sponsor of the bill, called
the change the ``Jim Crow amendment of 1990.''
   ``We ought to act on fact, not on perception,'' Hoyer said.
   ``The amendment is not about the reality of contagious disease.
It is about the fear of contagious disease,'' said Rep. James A.
McDermott, D-Wash., a medical doctor. ``Let's be honest. It's about
the fear of AIDS. This is what happens when you make public policy
on the basis of fear and ignorance.''
   The disabilities act, which cleared the Senate in September on a
76-8 vote, aims to guarantee the rights of an estimated 43 million
disabled people to equal employment, access to stores, restaurants
and other commercial establishments, transportation and
telecommunications service.
   The bill has been hailed as the most significant piece of civil
rights legislation since the 1964 Civil Right Act, which opened
opportunities to blacks, other minorities and women.
   The White House has endorsed the bill, despite its objections to
certain provisions. Hoyer said he was disappointed that the
administration did not take a stronger stand on the AIDS amendment.
   He said the measure would have been defeated had the White House
acted sooner. However, 79 of Hoyer's fellow Democrats voted for the
amendment, while 31 Republicans voted against it.
   The administration position came Thursday in a letter to House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley from Health and Human Services Secretary
Louis Sullivan.
   ``Food service workers infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency
virus, which causes AIDS) need not be restricted from work unless
they have other infections or illnesses for which any food service
worker should be restricted,'' Sullivan said.
   ``Since the act limits coverage for persons who pose a direct
threat to others, relaxing the anti-discrimination protection for
food service workers is not needed or justified in terms of the
protection of the public health,'' he added.
   The amendment ``says there's a prejudice out there and let's
pander to it,'' said Frank McCloskey, D-Ind. He invoked the memory
of Ryan White, the Indiana youth who recently died as a result of
AIDS acquired through a blood transfusion.
   Debate on the bill resumes Tuesday.

<HEAD>Underwater Reef Depicted in New Smithsonian Exhibition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A replica of an underwater reef that
flourished in West Texas 250 million years ago is a highlight of a
new $4 million exhibition opening today at the Smithsonian
Institution's National Museum of Natural History.
   The permanent installation, titled ``Life in the Ancient Seas,''
took four years to build. It marks the completion of the museum's
13-year project to consolidate and modernize its first-floor
complex of fossil displays, including the Dinosaur Hall.
   The new exhibition includes two huge murals by artist Ely Kish
that depict life-size prehistoric animals swimming underwater. One
mural, 16 feet by 120 feet, features a 20-foot marine lizard called
the mosasaur and a 45-foot Basilosaurus, an ancient whale.
   A camera connected to a circle of multiple lenses will allow
visitors to see themselves on a monitor as they would have been
seen through the eye of a trilobite, an primitive sea creature that
lived more than 500 million years ago.
   A walk-around diorama features the replica of a reef that lined
the shores of a shallow sea covering what is now West Texas near
the close of the Paleozoic era, which ended with a mass extinction
of sea life 230 million years ago.
   The reef is encrusted with more than 100,000 scale models of
ancient sea animals and plants, all cast in plastic from real
fossils found in West Texas. Special wave-tank lighting from the
ceiling gives the illusion of sunlight filtering through the waves
above the glassed-in diorama.
   Museum director Frank H. Talbot said the new exhibition, which
incorporates 2,000 specimens, gives an unparalleled view of the
evolution of sea life from the beginning of the Paleozoic era 570
million years ago to the present.

   ``We want to be able to stand on our own two
feet. We're tired of being dominated by foreigners.''
   Well now, who spoke those words?
   The list of potential candidates is long. This is, after all, a
leave-me-alone era, a time when ethnicity, tribal identity and a
yearning for self-determination seem to outweigh everything else,
especially ideology.
   There aren't many Lithuanians, Latvians or Estonians these days
who believe that ``socialist solidarity'' is an acceptable excuse
for remaining part of the Soviet Union.
   They want to run their own lives, free of outside control. The
same holds true for many Armenians, Azerbaijanis, Georgians and
Moldavians. In 1989, Eastern Europeans showed what they thought of
two generations of unelected, Soviet-backed Marxist rule.
   How about Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories? Or
the more than 20 million disenfranchised black South Africans? They
have shown, time and again, the desire to shape their own destiny
for a change.
   It is a sentiment that extends to people as diverse as Quebecers
and Kurds. Lebanese Muslims know the feeling and so do Eritreans.
The concept of national self-determination has turned the political
map of Africa upside down over the past generation. The last of the
continent's colonies, Namibia, became independent just two months
ago.
   It is an issue over which rivers of blood have been spilled.
George Washington was motivated by it. So was Ho Chi Minh.
   The United States itself has been both a proponent and a target
of this kind of sentiment. Independence from the United States has
been a major rallying cry of the Cuban revolution and of some
Nicaraguan and Panamanian nationalists. Many Puerto Ricans, albeit
a minority, yearn for nationhood for their island.
   So who did say those words?
   They were uttered recently in the Philippines before Monday's
start of talks on whether the United States will continue its
4-decade-old military presence in the Philippines.
   The speaker was Socorro Diokno, chairman of the Anti-Bases
Coalition. The issue ``is a quest for finding out who we are,''
Diokno declared. ``Can the Filipino stand on his feet without
having to rely on America?''
   The Philippines, of course, is not a classic case of unfettered
imperialism. The leadership is elected and there is popular
sentiment for working out an agreement with the United States
because the Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Base mean about $1
billion annually to the Philippines' economy. More than a quarter
of a million Filipinos depend on the bases for their livelihood.
   But the loudest voices lately have been those who advocate that
the 40,000 Americans working in base-related activities be sent
home.
   ``We will not stop until U.S. imperialism has been finally
driven from our shores,'' the Communist New People's Army said in a
statement Tuesday after confirming that it had assassinated two
American servicemen on the eve of the talks.
   Dissidents within the Philippines armed forces have vowed to
take military action against the bases if the Americans refuse to
vacate them.
   The sentiment against the bases is so vocal that the Philippines
government cannot ignore it. The sessions thus far between the two
countries, ostensibly military allies, have been acrimonious.
   The respective delegates have been arguing over how large the
U.S. economic aid shortfall is _ the United States says it's $96
million and the Philippines' figure is $222 million.
   Things are such that the mood between Manila and Washington is
focused less on Asian security than on ``price and pride,'' as a
recent report by a House Armed Services subcommittee put it.
   The issue may drag on for a while. The current U.S.-Filipino
Military Base Agreement expires in September 1991. President Bush
wants to keep the bases, but adds ``if we're not wanted there,
we're not going to be there.''

<HEAD>House Panel Freezing Farm Target Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Agriculture Committee is accepting
budget limits and voting to freeze target prices for crop subsidies
in the 1990 farm bill, starting with cotton and rice.
   Chairman Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, called the move Thursday
painful but said the committee had no choice.
   ``There had to be some serious surgical intervention,'' he said.
   The committee vote follows several days of meetings among
agriculture subcommittee chairmen and ranking Republicans who have
been looking for ways to cut back on promises made earlier when the
legislation was going through the subcommittees.
   ``What we do here will affect the other commodities,'' Rep. Dan
Glickman, D-Kan., chairman of the subcommittee on wheat, soybeans
and feed grains, said before the committee voted.
   Glickman said the committee was feeling pressure from throughout
Congress to avoid new spending in the farm bill. ``It's an attitude
that we are going to be a little more under siege than before,'' he
said.
   The freeze on cotton and rice target prices applies to all five
years of the farm bill.
   Currently, target prices for cotton and rice are higher than
market prices, which means the government must pay the farmer the
difference. This has been the case during the last five years.
   The cotton target price is 72.9 cents a pound. Last year's
market price was 55.6 cents a pound. The market figures for this
year are not yet available.
   The rice target price is $10.71 per hundred pounds, compared
with last year's market price of $6.83.
   De la Garza said he hoped the action was not misconstrued as
lack of support for the farmer.
   ``We are committed to enhance farm income,'' he said, noting
that the battle over the farm bill was not over. He also indicated
that the marketplace was a better place to improve income than the
government.
   De la Garza has said many times, however, that the committee
could not go to the House floor with a bill that was over budget.
   ``All in all, this is a major improvement,'' said John Campbell,
deputy undersecretary of agriculture. ``We are pleased that they
are moving in this direction.''
   The Bush administration wants a freeze on all target prices.
   The Senate Agriculture Committee is still working on its target
price programs. The Democratic majority has presented a plan to the
Republicans that calls for a 1 percent increase in 1991 to be
continued through the life of the bill.
   The Democrats also have proposed tying increases in the last
four years of the bill to the Consumer Price Index. Under the plan,
the agriculture secretary would be able to reduce that increase by
four percentage points if he so chose.

<DATELINE>TAPETA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Villagers waving palm fronds welcome him
as a savior. Rebel pamphlets call him ``The Hope of Liberia.'' The
bureaucrat turned guerrilla leader says he is a God-fearing Baptist
who will not become another African dictator.
   U.S.-educated rebel leader Charles Taylor is still wanted in
Massachusetts for breaking out of a jail to avoid extradition to
Liberia, but says he wants better relations with the United States.
   Taylor presented himself at his first international news
conference this week as a friend of the capitalist West _ a leader
who can restore democracy, honest government, pride and Christian
values to a nation destroyed by 10 years of corrupt rule under
President Samuel Doe.
   But Taylor said his plans for democracy do not include elections
for at least three and maybe five years. Until then he said he will
``go to hell'' rather than share power with other opposition
leaders who have not joined his fight against Doe.
   ``Don't think we are going to turn government over to someone to
screw up,'' Taylor said.
   Pointing to his ragtag group of armed guerrillas, most wearing
jeans and T-shirts, he added, ``We have political ambitions, too.''
   Taylor invited nine foreign journalists to Tapeta, in the heart
of rebel-held territory about 100 miles northeast of Monrovia, the
capital. Reporters were driven to an American-owned rubber
plantation in rebel hands just 45 miles east of Monrovia to
dramatize Taylor's threats that he will attack the city soon.
   Taylor's promises of elections in a few years are similar to
pledges that have led to dictatorships in other African countries,
including Liberia. Doe promised democracy when as an army master
sergeant he seized power in a bloody 1980 coup, toppling an elite
group of descendants of freed American slaves who founded Liberia
in 1847.
   At the time of the coup, Taylor said he had been chairman for 10
years of the U.S.-based National Liberian Liberation Movement that
helped Doe overthrow President William Tolbert.
   ``That boy was supposed to return his little self to the
barracks and he reneged,'' said Taylor, referring to Doe.
   Taylor said he was inducted into Doe's army as a major in 1980
and placed in charge of a bureau that disbursed government funds.
He said he fled to the United States later because of disagreements
with Doe, who accused him of stealing $1 million.
   He was arrested in Boston and held for extradition to Liberia in
1984, but escaped from jail and still is wanted in Massachusetts.
He did not appear to be troubled by that.
   ``I skipped from jail to escape Doe's lies,'' he said, adding he
believed ``all charges will be dropped.''
   Taylor said his National Patriotic Front of Liberia has
constantly sought contacts with the U.S. government, until recently
a strong supporter of Doe.
   ``The United States has permanent interests in Liberia, and not
permanent friends ... I would hope that we would have a real good
marriage and a real good honeymoon,'' Taylor said.
   The bearded rebel leader who has a degree in economics from
Bentley College in Waltham, Mass., described himself as a
``die-hard capitalist'' and ``church-going Christian'' whose few
vices include occasionally enjoying a good cigar.
   He says Doe's rule has led Liberians to break with their
traditional Christian values.
   ``Before, Liberians were interested in school, in church ...
Nobody thinks of going to church any more. Everybody talks of
ritualistic killings,'' he said.
   Taylor wears two woven juju amulets around his neck. Aides
refused to comment on them. Rebels who wore similar magic charms
said they were ``protection against bullets.''
   Many Liberians believe in black magic. Recently, former Defense
Minister Gray Allison was sentenced to death, and his wife,
Angeline, to life imprisonment for a ritual murder aimed at
empowering them to topple Doe.
   As a civilian, Taylor insists he is different from Doe, who made
his career in the military. He says he is leading ``a grassroots
civilian uprising to get rid of a dictator,'' but harbors no
dictatorial ambitions himself.
   ``It is so easy to make a dictator in Liberia, and I am not
going to permit myself to be one,'' he said.

   Military stonewalling and lying
obstruct prosecution of the slayings of six Jesuit priests, their
housekeeper and her daughter, according to foreign sources
following the case.
   The Bush administration says the outcome of the case will be a
major factor in future relations. Washington provides more than $1
million a day in aid to El Salvador, more than to any other country
in the Western Hemisphere.
   Judge Ricardo Zamora has been handling the case since shortly
after the bodies of the six educators and two women were found Nov.
16 at their Central American University residence.
   Zamora says there is not yet enough evidence to try the four
army officers and four soldiers in custody. A ninth defendant is a
fugitive.
   President Alfredo Cristiani says there may not be enough
evidence to convict Col. Guillermo Benavides, charged with ordering
the assassinations. Benavides headed the Military College, from
where the detail that killed the Jesuits set out.
   The slayings came five days after leftist rebels launched their
biggest offensive of a 10-year-old civil war. The right had long
considered the six Jesuits Marxists.
   Benavides is the highest-ranking officer ever indicted on human
rights charges. Only one other officer has been indicted, and he
has yet to stand trial.
   Between 40 and 60 men took part in the killings, and several
more likely knew about it soon afterward. But no military man has
voluntarily come forward to testify.
   ``It's total stonewalling,'' said a source very close to the
case who refused to be identified further. ``It demonstrates
eloquently the military's willingness to close ranks.''
   A European diplomat whose country has helped in the
investigation said: ``What we're dealing with is `Omerta''' _ a
reference to the Sicilian Mafia's code of silence. He and other
diplomats also refused to be identified further.
   The Salvadoran armed forces, the U.S. Embassy and a U.S.
congressional panel agree someone is lying.
   Earlier this year, U.S. Army Maj. Eric Buckland, who was
attached to the embassy, informed his superiors that a Salvadoran
colonel had told him Benevides was responsible.
   The embassy confronted the Salvadoran military's chief-of-staff
with the allegation _ and named Col. Carlos Aviles as the informant.
   Aviles later denied telling Buckland that Benavides was
responsible.
   Both Aviles and Buckland failed lie detector tests. Neither has
been questioned by Judge Zamora, and Buckland has been transferred
out of El Salvador.
   Three lieutenants have admitted their participation in the
massacre in testimony given Jan. 13-14 to U.S.-trained
investigators. Two of those officers told of an explicit order from
Benavides to kill the Jesuits.
   The case against Benavides is particularly weak. The colonel has
been implicated only by co-defendants _ the two lieutenants. In
Salvadoran law, testimony from a co-defendant is inadmissable.
   All three lieutenants reneged on earlier testimony when taken
before Zamora Jan. 16.
   Cristiani and Defense Minister Humberto Larios have pledged full
support for the investigation.
   Several members of the military Commission of Honor appointed by
Cristiani in January to investigate the murders have testified
before Zamora.
   The head of the Special Investigative Unit, a separate
police-led body, told U.S. lawmakers the honor commission
questioned implicated soldiers who confessed.
   That ostensibly was what permitted Cristiani on Jan. 13 to name
the nine alleged culprits.
   But the honor board members who have appeared in court this week
said they limited themselves to reviewing evidence and to simply
telling the soldiers to tell the truth.
   The U.S. Congressional task force said in an April 30 report:
``Neither U.S. nor Salvadoran officials with whom the task force
spoke could explain how President Cristiani was able to announce
the names of those to be charged ... if those names were not
provided to him by the honor board, and yet the honor board denies
doing anything of the kind.''
   Among the U.S. task force findings: ``All information provided
to the honor board by any of the soldiers involved should be
available to the judge and the prosecution. Instead, there is
currently no record of its actions and no admission on the part of
the honor board that it gathered any information, at all. This is
not credible, and in a serious investigation, not acceptable.''
   The court has been told that Military College log books _ which
reportedly were reviewed by the Special Investigative Unit and the
honor board _ have been ``lost.''
   ``There are people in high-level political and military realms
who are blocking this case,'' said another diplomat, whose
principal occupation for the past six months has been the Jesuit
investigation.

   A private plane that had been missing
for a week was found crashed in a dense forest with the bodies of
its six occupants nearby.
   The cause of the crash has not been determined, said state
police spokeswoman Lucy Caldwell. The wreckage was found Thursday
afternoon about 15 miles southwest of Fredericksburg, in northern
Virginia.
   The single-engine Cessna 210 vanished on an early morning flight
May 10 from Manteo, N.C., to Winchester, in northwest Virginia.
State police, Marines and Coast Guards had been searching for the
plane, which was obscured from the air by trees.
   ``We heard an airplane flying real low that night,'' said
Geraldine Smith, who lives near the crash site. ``We didn't put two
and two together when we heard about the lost plane.''
   The bodies were scattered in a 500-square-foot area around the
crash, Ms. Caldwell said.

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee says Senate adoption of a bill to combat chemical and
biological weapons puts the United States in the forefront of
countries fighting the deadly weapons.
   ``This puts us firmly on record in favor of a strong U.S. policy
against the use and proliferation of chemical and biological
weapons,'' Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said Thursday night shortly
after passage.
   By a 92-0 vote, the Senate approved the legislation that
requires U.S. sanctions against countries that violate
international agreements against the use of chemical and biological
weapons.
   The overwhelming vote came despite the threat of a possible veto
by President Bush. The measure was sent to a conference for
compromising with a version passed earlier by the House.
   The legislation also comes as the United States and Soviet Union
are negotiating cuts in the superpower stockpiles of chemical
weapons and reductions in strategic and conventional forces.
   But lawmakers said they are concerned about the proliferation of
the weapons among Third World countries.
   ``It's clear that the inhibition against the use of chemical
weapons is slipping,'' Pell said.
   The legislation, which had bipartisan support, was prompted by
the use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war and Iraq's use of
the weapons last year against its Kurdish minority.
   In addition, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has vowed to use
chemical weapons against Israel in retaliation if his country is
attacked.
   ``Many months ago, I said that the evil genie of chemical
weapons is already out of the bottle,'' said Senate Republican
Leader Bob Dole of Kansas. ``It's even more critical today that we
do everything we can to see that the genie does not spread its
poison more widely.''
   The bill says that as many as 20 nations are capable of
producing chemical weapons and that by the year 2000, at least 15
developing countries will have the ability to produce ballistic
missiles capable of delivering the weapons.
   The sanctions in the bill would call for a cutoff of arms sales,
an embargo on imports from violating countries, an end to credit
guarantees from the Export-Import Bank, a halt to financial
assistance from U.S. banks and an end to military and economic
assistance.
   The sanctions would apply to countries as well as foreign
companies that help the nations get the chemical and biological
weapons.
   Administration officials said they would recommend a veto of the
Senate legislation because it would limit the president's ability
to conduct foreign policy.
   Senators who did not vote on final passage were William
Armstrong, R-Colo.; Phil Gramm, R-Texas; Gordon Humphrey, R-Vt.;
James Jeffords, R-Vt.; Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.; Don Nickles,
R-Okla.; Steve Symms, R-Idaho; and Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo.

   Efforts to slow the spread of nuclear weapons
technologies are likely to fail unless the United States and other
nuclear-capable nations stop adding to their own arsenals, says a
former U.S. arms negotiator.
   Gerard C. Smith, director of the Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency in the Nixon administration and a former chief U.S.
negotiator at the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, said the nuclear
nations should accept a freeze on their own nuclear testing and
deployments, as well as production of nuclear arms materials.
   ``If the majority of nations are to be expected indefinitely to
forgo (nuclear) arms ... should not nations already deploying them
also accept some constraints, especially now that the Cold War is
over?'' Smith told the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on arms
control and international security on Thursday.
   Meantime late Thursday, the Senate approved, 92-0, and sent to a
conference with the House a bill aimed at halting the proliferation
of chemical and biological weapons.
   The measure, which has drawn a veto threat from the White House,
would require sanctions against countries that use the weapons and
against foreign companies that help the countries get them.
   ``We have learned anew in recent years of the ghastly and
indisputable horror of the use of chemical weapons in violation of
international law,'' said Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of
the Foreign Relations Committee. ``We must not apply a lesser
standard against chemical weapons use than the use of nuclear
weapons.''
   President Bush opposes the bill on the ground it would limit his
authority to conduct foreign policy.
   In addition, the administration opposes a total ban on nuclear
weapons testing. It is negotiating with Moscow on ways to verify an
existing but unratified ban on underground nuclear tests. The two
sides are hoping to announce an agreement on verification during
the superpower summit that begins May 30.
   The administration also is against banning all future nuclear
arms deployments, although it is pursuing a Strategic Arms
Reduction treaty to reduce U.S. and Soviet long-range nuclear
missile arsenals by about one-third.
   In addition to the five declared nuclear powers _ the United
States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China _ Smith said
Israel, Pakistan and India are believed to have nuclear weapons
capability. South Africa, Argentina and Brazil are believed to be
on the threshold of developing the capability, he said.
   ``Any of these nations could bring on a major crisis by testing,
deploying or threatening to use nuclear weapons,'' Smith said.
   He said the U.S. government has perpetuated a misconception that
the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty _ aimed at limiting the ``nuclear
club'' to the five declared powers _ is working. The treaty is due
to expire in March 1995; an international review of the 140-nation
pact is to begin this summer in Geneva.
   David Albright, senior staff scientist at the Federation of
American Scientists, an arms control advocacy group, told the panel
that even some signatories to the treaty _ such as Iraq, Libya,
Taiwan and North Korea _ may be attempting secretly to gain nuclear
weapons.
   Smith also urged that the Bush administration negotiate a ban on
production of plutonium and other nuclear weapons materials.
Albright concurred, saying a halt would limit the number of weapons
that could be built and prevent nations without such materials from
producing any weapons at all.
   The administration told Congress last year that it opposed such
a ban.

   Japan became a ``Rhythm Nation'' as Janet Jackson
opened her tour at the Tokyo Dome, cascading thunderous waves of
funk and choreography over 50,000 people.
   Teen-agers in miniskirts, families with children and men in
business suits rose as one Thursday night when the pop star,
silhouetted in colored smoke, was lifted to the massive stage on a
platform and launched into ``Control.''
   ``Want to get nasty?'' she yelled as she strutted and rapped her
way through ``Nasty.'' Fans roared their approval, but kept their
decorum.
   It was the opening for Miss Jackson's five-night appearance in
Japan on her first world tour. She travels next to the Japanese
cities of Osaka and Yokohama, back to the United States and then on
to Europe in September.
   The energy and enthusiasm of Miss Jackson and her 15-member
troupe managed to punch through the cavernous expanse of Tokyo
Dome, an indoor baseball stadium nicknamed the Big Egg.
   She donned a paramilitary uniform with medals and billed hat _ a
getup mimicked by many of her fans _ to close the show with
``Rhythm Nation,'' a song popularized by its use since January in
Japan Airlines commercials.
   The choreography, a cross between break-dancing and military
maneuvers, sent some spectators dancing into the aisles.

   Remember those kids who used to tell Art
Linkletter the darndest things on TV? Well, they're older now, but
Linkletter says he's still a kid at heart.
   When he isn't pitching recliners on television, Linkletter likes
to ski, surf and scuba dive _ in short, all those fun things that
other young guys do.
   ``There is no definition for old except attitude and mobility,''
the 78-year-old Linkletter said. ``Attitude tells whether you are
old or not. If you are curious, challenging, doing something, you
are not old.''
   Not that Linkletter denies he might be getting old.
   ``I've never had a mid-life crisis, but 80 is daunting,'' he
said. ``This is the only birthday I've looked at with some
suspicion. Eighty sounds pretty damn old.''
   But it could be that when 80 arrives, Linkletter will be too
busy to notice.
   The author of 23 books and the star of two of the most beloved
shows in television history, ``House Party'' and ``People Are
Funny,'' is involved in a new project, making a home video called
``How to Be a Great Grandparent.''

   Art Buchwald has attacked Paramount Pictures'
claim that the hit Eddie Murphy movie ``Coming to America'' lost
$18 million, contending in court papers that it made $39.8 million.
   Superior Court Judge Harvey Schneider ruled in January that
Paramount must pay Buchwald $250,000 and 19 percent of the film's
net profits. Paramount has said it will appeal the decision.
   Buchwald claimed the studio stole his script idea, titled ``King
For A Day,'' which dealt with an African prince who comes to live
in the United States. The film's credits attributed the idea to
Murphy.
   In papers filed Wednesday, the humorist's lawyer, Pierce
O'Donnell, said the share of the net profit due his client and
producer Alan Bernheim should range between $6.9 million and $14.6
million.
   ``The studio's reaction is that their claims are baseless and
unfounded,'' said Robert Schwartz, a lawyer for Paramount.
   The 1988 ``Coming to America'' has grossed $275 million
worldwide.

   ``The idea is to take it back to the way it all started out,

<HEAD>Chinese Leader Has No Regrets Over Smashing Demonstration</HEAD>

   China's top leader says he has no regrets
about the way troops handled pro-democracy demonstrators in
Tiananmen Square, mowing down hundreds of protesters last June.
   Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin also said the West's anger
over the killings was ``like much ado about nothing.''
   Jiang spoke in an interview with Barbara Walters, to be aired
tonight on ABC-TV's ``20-20'' program. His decision to grant the
interview, his first with a foreign television reporter since he
assumed office last June, appeared aimed at dissuading the United
States from revoking trade concessions for China.
   President Bush, who imposed some economic sanctions against
China to protest the crackdown, has until June 3 to decide whether
to extend China's most-favored-nation, or MFN, status by one year.
MFN, which is granted to most U.S. trading partners, reduces
tariffs significantly on exports to this country.
   Bush said Wednesday that while he did not want to send a signal
to Beijing that he approves of the government's human rights
record, removing MFN would adversely affect Hong Kong, the British
colony that funnels 70 percent of China's exports to the United
States.
   In the interview, Jiang warned that revoking China's trade
concessions would ``work against the interests of our two
countries'' and those of the entire southeast Asian region. ``I
hope that the U.S. government would consider this matter from a
long-term perspective,'' he said.
   Jiang, who was handpicked by the country's retired leader Deng
Xiaoping as his successor after the Tiananmen Square killings, said
he doesn't ``have any regret about the way in which we dealt with
the events which took place last year in Beijing.''
   But, he added, Chinese leaders ``learn by our mistakes,'' so
similar demonstrations in the future may be handled with non-lethal
force. ``We have made adequate preparations in terms of
strengthening the police force and storing of non-lethal weapons,''
he said.
   Nonetheless, Jiang said he would not brook any opposition to
socialism and would combat ``bourgeois liberalization.''
   China is not opposed to everything about capitalism, however, he
said. ``We want to learn from the know-how and even buy know-how
from Western countries,'' he said.
   Providing a rare glimpse of the internal workings of China's
aging leadership, Jiang conceded ``there were different opinions
within the top Chinese leadership, and that was the crucial point''
in the decision to resort to lethal force to quell the protest.
   When the hardliners triumphed, the Communist Party's secretary
general, Zhao Ziyang, was deposed for supporting the protesters.
   Jiang said that at the start of the student unrest in April
1989, had ``we adopted resolute measures, for example by declaring
a ban on assembly in Tiananmen Square, then it would have been
easier for us to deal with the problem at a later stage.''
   Jiang was mayor of Shanghai at the time, and he said he dealt
with protesters there by persuasion rather than force.
   After the Beijing crackdown, he said, ``some kind of
misunderstanding, lack of understanding, or even not-so-friendly
attitudes towards China occurred'' in the West.
   ``Therefore, to give you a Chinese proverb, I would say it's
like `much ado about nothing,''' he said.
   Outside estimates of the number of demonstrators killed have
ranged from 700 to thousands.
   Jiang said no protesters were executed as a direct result of the
Tiananmen events even though China's official press reported 20
executions.
   He said 431 people are still in detention in connection with
their activities in the pro-democracy movement, among them 42
students.
   According to unofficial estimates, 10,000 or 15,000 people were
detained after the Tiananmen killings, although many have since
been released. Last week China announced it had released 211
prisoners, including several prominent academics.

   Lawmakers removed a major obstacle in their
drive to provide emergency aid for Nicaragua and Panama by
stripping an abortion provision that President Bush had threatened
to veto.
   Today, House-Senate negotiators trying to iron out differences
in a supplemental appropriation bill planned to tackle the last
part of the legislation: defense spending.
   But negotiators dropped a Senate-passed provision that would
have allowed the District of Columbia to use local tax dollars to
pay for abortions for poor women.
   Even though Bush desperately wants Congress to hurry up on the
package that contains $420 million for Panama and $300 million for
Nicaragua, he vowed to veto the money bill if it contained the
abortion provision. The president vetoed a similar abortion measure
last year.
   In a flurry of deal-making, lawmakers abandoned the abortion
provision along with a Republican-sponsored measure that would have
permitted use of the death penalty for drug-related murders in the
District of Columbia.
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., sponsor of the abortion provision,
said the issue was gone but not forgotten. ``We will be back to
pass pro-choice legislation,'' he said. ``We've got the votes.''
   While aid to Nicaragua and Panama are the centerpieces of the
money bill, it is full of extra provisions and pork-barrel projects
that total $3.3 billion.
   All week, administration officials have prodded Congress to move
on the supplemental bill.
   Former House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, joined the chorus on
Thursday.
   ``When I retired from Congress last year, I vowed I would never
lobby or harass my old colleagues about anything,'' he said in a
letter to House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill.
   ``Please indulge me one exception. It involves an area in which
I've had a consuming interest _ Latin America,'' Wright said. He
said it was ``extremely important'' for Congress to act ``as
swiftly as possible'' on the Nicaragua-Panama aid.
   Bush has said that new Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro
urgently needs the money because her country is bankrupt and has
been rocked by anti-government strikes.
   Once negotiators have reached final agreement, the spending
package must be approved by the full House and Senate.
   And the money cannot be spent in Central America until a
separate authorization bill is passed by the House. Debate is set
for Monday.
   Among the host of items in the spending bill are $110 million
for the 1990 census; about $162 million for the Head Start program
for poor children; $400 million in housing loans for Israel to
build homes for Soviet emigres; $45 million for Peru and Bolivia;
$705 million for the food stamp program; $10 million for natural
disasters; $5 million for children in Cambodia and roughly $60
million for flood control.
   Conferees removed $10 million proposed for a U.S. Embassy in
Lithuania.
   There was friction between the House and some senators over the
amount of free mail House members have sent this year.
   The House postage account will be about $44 million in the red
by the end of the year, lawmakers said. Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif.,
asked _ and senators conditionally agreed _ to let the House use
$25 million in unspent funds from an operations fund to help make
up the postage deficit.
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., said the House should reform its mail
system.
   ``The House's refusal to disclose each member's mass mail costs
has resulted in a taxpayer-funded mass mail frenzy in the House to
which no individual member is held accountable,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   New Jersey's Legislature has passed the
nation's toughest ban on assault weapons despite intense pressure
from hundreds of vocal gun supporters.
   Some of the bill opponents apparently smashed a window in the
Assembly chamber during the debate Thursday. Assembly leaders said
it was broken inadvertently, and National Rifle Association
lobbyist Richard Manning took a collection to pay for the damage.
   California is the only other state to ban assault weapons.
Supporters of the New Jersey bill said this ban would be tougher
because it would not exempt current owners of the weapons.
   Gov. Jim Florio praised the bill and promised to sign it as
early as next week. The state Senate approved the bill, 21-17. The
Assembly passed it, 43-33, after nearly five hours of debate.
   ``The state can take a great amount of pride that we will have
the strongest such law on the books in the nation,'' said Florio,
surrounded by Democratic lawmakers at a news conference.
   ``Everyone has the right to be safe and secure on the street and
in their homes,'' Florio said. ``These military weapons are
specifically designed to go out and kill as many people as possible
as quickly as possible.''
   The bill's supporters said assault weapon possession had no
justification in peacetime, but gun lovers said the measure was an
affront to arms provisions in the U.S. Constitution.
   A plate-glass window also was broken early Thursday morning at
the Toms River legislative office shared by state Sen. John Russo,
Assemblywoman Marlene Lynch Ford and Assemblyman John Paul Doyle,
all Democrats and strong supporters of the bill.
   The Dover Township police said the lawmakers ``may have been the
target of vandalism'' by gun supporters.
   In Trenton, gun supporters rallied outside the Statehouse Annex,
swarmed around lawmakers following morning committee meetings, and
loudly chanted against Florio, the bill and its sponsors in the
halls.
   ``You're not going to intimidate us,'' responded Assemblyman
Michael Adubato. ``You make me sad and angry.''
   Under the bill, owners of assault firearms would have a year to
sell them out-of-state or surrender them to police.
   Collectors would be able to keep their weapons if they rendered
them inoperable by removing firing pins or bolts. Target shooters
would be allowed to keep their weapons if they could prove they
were used in target competitions. The bill would require these gun
owners to register the weapons every two years.
   Those arrested for illegally possessing the firearms would face
three to five years in jail and a fine of up to $7,500.
   Supporters of the bill said it was drafted in response to the
murder of five children and the wounding of 30 others by an assault
weapon-wielding gunman at an elementary school in Stockton, Calif.,
in January 1989.
   ``How can anyone in good conscience wait for such a tragedy
before we decide to act?'' said Sen. Daniel J. Dalton. ``It could
happen here.''
   Opponents of the bill said it is too restrictive and costly for
target shooters and collectors. They said the bill was a misguided
attempt to stem the use of such weapons by criminals who won't
respect the law.
   ``The people you're going after, the drug dealers, you're not
going to do a thing to them,'' said Sen. Raymond Zane. ``You're
going after law-abiding citizens.''

<HEAD>Mrs. Gorbachev to Address Commencement With Mrs. Bush</HEAD>

   Barbara Bush and her Soviet counterpart, Raisa
Gorbachev, will share the commencement platform at Wellesley
College, where some members of the Class of 1990 had questioned the
American first lady's speaking credentials.
   Mrs. Gorbachev has accepted Mrs. Bush's invitation to accompany
her to the June 1 commencement, and the wife of Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev will deliver her own address to the graduates,
a spokeswoman for Mrs. Bush said Thursday.
   Mrs. Bush is ``absolutely delighted'' that Mrs. Gorbachev, who
has a Ph.D in philosophy, will accompany her on the summit-time
excursion to the exclusive Massachusetts college for women, said
the first lady's press secretary, Anna Perez.
   Mrs. Bush has also invited Mrs. Gorbachev to visit colonial
Williamsburg, Va., but there is no word yet on whether the Soviet
first lady wants to go there, Ms. Perez said.
   The two first ladies will travel together to Wellesley on the
second day of their husbands' four-day summit at the White House
and Camp David, Md.
   Some 150 students at Wellesley _ one-quarter of the graduating
class _ signed a petition last month questioning the choice of Mrs.
Bush as a commencement speaker.
   The petition said she had ``gained recognition through her
husband's achievements,'' not her own, ``which contradicts what we
have been taught over our years at Wellesley.''
   Mrs. Bush dropped out of Smith College after her freshman year
in 1944 to marry Bush, then a Navy pilot. The couple was wed in
January 1945, a few months after Bush survived the downing of his
plane in the Pacific.
   Mrs. Bush, who turns 65 on June 8, has been a career homemaker,
lifelong volunteer and mother of six who moved dozens of time with
her husband during his farflung careers in the oil business,
politics and diplomacy. She has gained recognition in recent years
for promoting literacy and other causes, including the care of
babies with AIDS.
   Some feminists and others expressed outrage at the student's
petition slighting Mrs. Bush's qualifications.
   But Ms. Perez said of the first lady: ``She doesn't think it's a
controversy.''
   ``She absolutely understands ... where the young women are
coming from and she hopes they understand where she is coming
from,'' the spokeswoman said.
   Asked if the Wellesley students might regard Mrs. Gorbachev as
just a mother, Ms. Perez replied, ``Ph.D. in philosophy, party
member _ I don't think so.''
   Mrs. Gorbachev, 58, is a former university lecturer with a
doctorate in philosophy from Moscow State University. The couple
met in a ballroom dancing class while Gorbachev was in law school
and she was a graduate student from Siberia.

<HEAD>Bush Promises Firm Civil Rights Effort But `Won't Sign Quota Bill'</HEAD>

   President Bush says he wants a bill that would
eliminate bias in the American workplace but not one that would
usher in hiring quotas and end up as ``some lawyers' bonanza.''
   ``We can and will make America open and equal to all,'' Bush
said Thursday at a ceremony in the Rose Garden.
   ``I want to sign a civil rights bill, but I will not sign a
quota bill,'' he told an audience gathered to honor the U.S.
Commission on Civil Rights.
   On Capitol Hill, the major civil rights bill before the Senate
gained support from two Republicans and six Democrats after
sponsors bowed to critics in the business community and softened it
a bit. They said the move should put to rest concern that the
measure might bring in hiring quotas.
   But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said the changes would not solve
the problem. The White House said it was withholding judgment.
   The bill is designed to overcome six Supreme Court decisions on
job discrimination last year. Provisions range from a ban on racial
harassment in the workplace to procedures aimed at making it easier
to win lawsuits against employers in hiring discrimination cases.
   ``We will leave nothing to chance and no stone unturned as we
work to advance America's civil rights agenda,'' Bush said. ``...
We will tolerate no barriers, no bias, no inside tracks, no
two-tiered system and no rungless ladders.''
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh threatened last month to
recommend a veto of the bill. He told the House Judiciary Committee
this week that changes being made in the measure were for the good,
but he stopped short of support.
   Bush met with civil rights leaders and others three times this
week in an effort to reach agreement on the legislation.
   He said Thursday that the law must ``obliterate'' consideration
of race, color, religion, sex or national origin from hiring. And
he said it should protect ``against harassment in the workplace
based on race, sex, religion or disability and should ensure a
speedy end to such discriminatory practices.''
   ``Our civil rights laws, however, should not be turned into some
lawyers' bonanza, encouraging litigation at the expense of
conciliation, mediation or settlement,'' the president added.
   Benjamin Hooks Jr., executive director of the NAACP, joined
senators in announcing the changes in the bill. He said it was ``a
very happy day'' because it would end the question of quotas, which
he said had become ``a bugaboo.''
   The bill would expand the ability of minorities to win monetary
damages for job discrimination. It also would force employers named
in lawsuits to either end discriminatory hiring practices or prove
that they constituted a business necessity.
   Proving business necessity in such cases had been up to
employers for 18 years before a Supreme Court decision last year
that put the burden on those who claimed to be victims of
discrimination.
   As initially introduced, the bill would have required to
employers to prove that discriminatory practices were ``essential''
to job performance.
   The revised version would require only proof that such practices
had a ``substantial and demonstrable relationship to effective job
performance.''
   A House committee made the same change two weeks ago at the
urging of Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif.
   Becoming sponsors following the change were Sens. John C.
Danforth, R-Mo.; John Heinz, R-Pa.; Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas; Charles
S. Robb, D-Va.; Daniel K. Akaka, D-Hawaii; Bob Graham, D-Fla.; Jay
Rockefeller, D-W.Va.; and Harry Reid, D-Nev.
   Danforth said he thought Bush eventually would sign the bill,
but he said he was prepared to vote to override a presidential veto.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., told the news conference that
the Senate would pass the measure within a month. He said the
``House is on a similar course and now the White House seems to be,
too.''
   Hatch, however, issued a statement saying the ``amendment in no
way solves the severe quota problem in the bill.''
   Bush ``and his advisers are too smart to be taken in by this new
language. The right of employers to hire the most qualified
employees ought to be maintained,'' Hatch added.

   A two-time killer who shot a Louisiana state
trooper to death was executed early Friday despite international
outcries that he was nearly mentally retarded and a mere teen-ager
at the time of the crime.
   Dalton Prejean, who had won 10 previous delays of scheduled
executions, was pronounced dead in the state electric chair at
12:21 a.m. CDT.
   The U.S. Supreme Court voted 7-2 Thursday night to deny a stay
for Prejean.
   Warden John Whitley said Prejean had been ``relatively calm''
throughout the day.
   Prejean's execution was the nation's third in 24 hours. Texas
and Missouri each executed killers early Thursday. His death was
the 128th in the nation, and the 19th in Louisiana, since capital
punishment resumed in 1977.
   There were two small protests prior to Prejean's execution _ one
by death penalty opponents outside the Governor's Mansion in Baton
Rouge and another by supporters outside the penitentiary's main
gate.
   Earlier, Gov. Buddy Roemer said he would not stop the execution.
Twice in the past year Roemer rejected his own hand-picked Pardon
Board's recommendations that he commute the sentence to life in
prison.
   ``I'm never happy with these things but I do not, as a
representative of the people, have a choice,'' said Roemer.
   Prejean, 30, acknowledged he shot the trooper but said it would
not serve justice to execute him.
   Not since the earliest of executions has a pending death
sentence brought so much protest.
   Defense lawyers said Prejean had an IQ of 71, barely above
retardation. Doctors said he suffered brain damage as a child,
apparently at the hands of an abusive aunt who raised him.
   ``I doubt that in documented recent world history there is an
execution ... that has such a pile of reasons not to do it,'' said
Steve Herrick, southern regional director for Amnesty International.
   He took part in a protest on the steps of the Capitol in Baton
Rouge, where a dozen people marched in a circle and chanted ``Death
penalty must go'' and ``Tell Roemer: Stop the execution.''
   Other anti-death penalty vigils were held across the state,
Herrick said.
   The National Association of Black Police Officers went on record
against Prejean's execution, as did the American Civil Liberties
Union and numerous other civil rights organizations.
   In Strassbourg, France, the European Parliament on Thursday
called for commutation of Prejean's death sentence and a review of
the evidence in his case.
   Prejean was 14 when he killed a taxi driver and 17 when, after a
stint in reform school, he gunned down state trooper Donald
Cleveland in Lafayette.
   Cleveland was married and the father of two. His widow, Candy,
denounced efforts to stop the execution.
   A black man, Prejean was tried by an all white jury for killing
the white trooper.
   Prejean's age and race, the all-white jury, his mental state,
his use of alcohol and drugs at the time of the killing _ all have
been factors in numerous unsuccessful state and federal appeals.
   In one of the latest appeals, the Louisiana Supreme Court on
Wednesday rejected arguments that Prejean should be spared. His
attorneys argued that a psychiatric evaluation before his 1978
trial was inadequate and that the jury therefore never learned
Prejean was retarded.
   Prejean had blamed racism and politics for the failure of
efforts to call off the execution.
   He told the Pardon Board earlier this year that he was truly
remorseful for the two murders and would be willing to stay in
prison for life to pay for his crime. But his death would not serve
justice, he said.
   In Thursday's executions, Leonard Laws, 40, was put to death by
injection in Missouri for the robbery and shotgun slayings of an
elderly couple.
   In Texas, 30-year-old Johnny Ray Anderson was executed by
injection for a 1981 slaying that was part of a scheme to collect
$67,000 in insurance money.

<HEAD>Advisers Disagree Over Future of Radio Free Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advisers to the Bush administration are
bickering over a proposal to halt Radio Free Europe's broadcasts to
Eastern Europe if democracy takes root there.
   The debate burst into the open this week after the U.S. Advisory
Commission on Public Diplomacy urged that planning begin now to let
the Voice of America take over from Radio Free Europe when
conditions are right in the former communist bloc.
   ``At some stage you have to ask yourself, what justification is
there for the U.S. government to be reporting what's going on
inside Poland, for example, and competing with 20 or 25 independent
Polish broadcast stations,'' said Edward Fuelner, chairman of the
advisory panel.
   The commission said Radio Free Europe could be terminated when
the move to democracy becomes irreversible and when independent
private broadcast operations are flourishing in Eastern Europe,
free of state control.
   But Malcolm Forbes Jr., chairman of the Board for International
Broadcasting which operates Radio Free Europe, took strong
exception to the proposal.
   ``Given that Radio Free Europe enjoys several times the audience
of the Voice of America in Eastern and Central Europe, it is
premature to call for an end to RFE broadcasts to countries in the
region,'' he said.
   The advisory commission advises the United States Information
Agency, which operates the Voice of America, and Forbes said the
relationship had influenced the panel's proposal.
   ``The motives of such a recommendation concerning RFE must be
questioned in light of the commission's close relationship with
USIA,'' said Forbes, who called for the creation of an independent
presidential commission to review the issue.
   Forbes is president of Forbes inc. and deputy editor of Forbes
magazine. Fuelner is president of the politically conservative
Heritage Foundation.
   Fuelner replied that Forbes' statement was ``a cheap shot at the
commission. I'm surprised and disappointed by the tone of it.''
   ``They took one specific recommendation that we worded carefully
and reworded it in such a way as to make it sound like we are on
opposite sides, and we are not,'' Fuelner said.
   He noted the commission said the change would be premature now,
but could be made eventually.
   ``I'm a free enterpriser,'' Fuelner said. ``And I don't think
the U.S. government ought to be competing with private internal
domestic (news) services. All we're saying is, plan for those
days.''
   U.S. officials say the future of U.S. broadcasts to Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union is under intensive review inside the
government.
   But they say that while changes in format or content may be
recommended, no one is predicting the early demise of either Radio
Free Europe or Radio Liberty, which broadcasts to the Soviet Union.
   Radio Free Europe was established in 1950 with funds from the
CIA. Control was transferred to the independent Board for
International Broadcasting in 1951.
   The mission of the RFE operation has been to report news of
Eastern Europe not being reported by state-run media organizations.
The Voice of America reports U.S. news from an American perspective.

<HEAD>Report Criticizes VA's Refusal to Compensate Agent Orange-Related
Illness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A report to Veterans Secretary Edward J.
Derwinski sharply criticizes the government for its longstanding
refusal to compensate Vietnam veterans for illnesses linked to
Agent Orange exposure.
   The report by Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. was released the same
day an advisory panel to the Department of Veterans Affairs paved
the way for compensation to Vietnam veterans suffering from a rare
cancer known as soft-tissue sarcoma.
   Derwinski is expected to decide in late May or early June
whether to award compensation for that form of cancer.
   ``I hope this is the beginning of the end of the nightmare Agent
Orange victims have suffered,'' said Sen. Thomas A. Daschle,
D-S.D., a co-chair of the Vietnam-Era Veterans in Congress caucus.
   The VA Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards made its
recommendation Thursday after reviewing scientific studies on the
connection between dioxin and herbicide exposure to soft tissue
sarcoma.
   Zumwalt, one of four lay members of the 15-member panel,
criticized the committee Wednesday for its previous handling of the
Agent Orange question. The panel was created by Congress in 1984 to
investigate the link between exposure and a host of ailments,
largely cancers, that Vietnam veterans have been complaining about
since the 1970s.
   A federal court order last year, which Derwinski declined to
appeal, forced the panel to begin its work anew. Although the last
Agent Orange was sprayed in 1971, the VA has awarded only a handful
of Agent Orange claims, and those were all for a skin condition
called chloracne.
   Derwinski decided in March that all Vietnam veterans with
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma should be compensated.
   The American Legion, the Vietnam Veterans of America and outside
scientists commissioned by the two groups have long criticized the
government's refusal to acknowledge health hazards associated with
Agent Orange. The herbicide was contaminated with dioxin, labeled a
``probable human carcinogen'' by the Environmental Protection
Agency.
   On Thursday, the VA released a report that Zumwalt compiled for
Derwinski.
   ``Were the faulty conclusions, flawed methodology and noticeable
bias of the advisory committee an isolated problem, correcting the
misdirection would be more manageable,'' Zumwalt wrote.
   ``But, experience with other governmental agencies responsible
for specifically analyzing and studying the effects of exposure to
Agent Orange strongly hints at a discernible pattern, if not
outright governmental collaboration, to deny compensation to
Vietnam veterans associated with exposure to dioxin,'' he wrote.
   Zumwalt referred to the federal Centers for Disease Control,
given responsibility by Congress for conducting Agent Orange
studies because of ``evidence of VA's footdragging.''
   Zumwalt repeated allegations raised in a congressional hearing
last summer that CDC sabotaged its Agent Orange study, suggesting
``that political pressures once again interfered with the kind of
professional, unbiased review Congress had sought to obtain.''
   Compensation for Agent Orange will cost nearly $90 million for
only a few of the ailments linked to the herbicide, the
Congressional Budget Office says.
   CDC has maintained it cannot establish who among Vietnam
veterans was exposed to Agent Orange, making further study
impossible.
   Zumwalt said his own review of the scientific evidence suggests
28 ailments, mostly cancers, can be linked to Agent Orange exposure.
   Zumwalt, commander of naval forces in Vietnam, ordered the
spraying of the defoliant in Vietnam and lost a son, a Vietnam
veteran, to a cancer linked to Agent Orange exposure. Zumwalt has
said he nonetheless would have ordered the spraying because it
ultimately saved more lives than it cost.
   Zumwalt said the herbicide was used in undiluted form to remove
enemy cover, destroy enemy crops and clear vegetation around
military installations, landing zones, fire base camps and trails.
   He said more was sprayed than records indicate, because of
unofficial uses of the herbicide.

   Most Americans oppose cutting the Social
Security payroll tax, according to a nationwide survey released
today.
   The Gallup poll, conducted for the Employee Benefit Research
Institute, found that 57 percent of those surveyed don't want to
see the payroll tax cut, and 69 percent said they would oppose it
if other taxes would be raised.
   Of the 25 percent who said they were aware of Sen. Patrick
Moynihan's proposal to cut the tax, 51 percent were in favor, 37
percent were opposed and the rest were undecided.
   Moynihan's proposal also would prohibit the Social Security
reserves from being used to reduce the size of the federal budget
deficit.
   More than half of those polled said the deficit is ``the most
important issue'' or a ``very important issue'' to them.
   But 81 percent said the government's practice of loaning Social
Security funds to pay for federal programs was ``inappropriate.''
   The poll also found concern over the future solvency of the
system, with 47 percent of those surveyed who are not retired
saying they do not think the system will pay them benefits when
they retire. And 77 percent said higher taxes will be needed to
keep benefits flowing in the next century.
   Also, 54 percent said they did not want to tax earnings over the
current limit of $51,300 unless new benefits were provided.
   The Gallup Organization Inc. surveyed 1,000 American adults by
telephone in March. The survey has a margin of error of plus or
minus 3.1 percent.

   Renoir's joyful depiction of an open-air dance
hall in Paris, ``Au Moulin de la Galette,'' was auctioned Thursday
for $78.1 million, days after a haunting portrait by van Gogh sold
for a record $82.5 million.
   The world's two most expensive paintings were bought by the same
man _ Japanese industrialist Ryoei Saito, Japan's Kyodo News
Service reported Friday.
   Van Gogh's ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' was purchased Tuesday by
the Kobayashi Gallery of Tokyo for Saito, the 74-year-old owner of
the Daishowa Paper Manufacturing Company. Kyodo reported Friday
that Saito also bought the Renoir.
   Prior to its sale, five of the 11 most expensive paintings sold
at auction have been bought by Japanese bidders.
   The Renoir was among 58 of 70 works of Impressionist and modern
art bought at Sotheby's auction house for a total of $286 million,
``a record sale in any way that you want to count it,'' said
auctioneer John Marion.
   The bidding for the Pierre Auguste Renoir started at $25 million
and went up in increments of $1 million. As it got beyond $40
million, the audience started gasping. The price, which included a
10 percent buyer's premium, was the second-highest in art auction
history.
   The large canvas of an afternoon crowd of revelers in a
sun-filled garden framed by acacia trees had a presale estimate of
$40 million to $50 million, the same as Vincent van Gogh's
record-setting ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet.''
   Marion called the final price ``marvelous.''
   ``Au Moulin de la Galette'' was the highlight of the sale, but
paintings by Kandinsky and Chagall also set records for works sold
at auction by those artists.
   Even so, bidding for some of the rest of the 69 lots reflected
the scaling back of the art market. The trend was also evident at
Tuesday night's sale at Christie's, where ``Dr. Gachet'' was the
star painting, and last week's contemporary art sales.
   Despite the new record for a single auction, 17 of the offerings
at Sotheby's sold for less than the presale estimate, and 12 were
not sold at all because thy failed to reach a minimum sale price
set confidentially by the seller.
   The Christie's sale had brought a total of $269.4 million, only
$67,000 under the previous record for an art auction, also held by
Sotheby's. But 24 of the 81 offerings there went unsold and some
that did sell went for significantly less than their presale
estimate.
   Marion, however, said he felt Thursday's prices were strong
overall. ``It is a very solid market,'' he said. The auction house
had expected the sale to bring in $212.7 million to $284.6 million.
   ``When you have a tremendous painting, like the van Gogh or the
Renoir that's coming up ... you're going to get extraordinary
prices,'' said Milton Esterow, editor and publisher of ARTnews.
   Otherwise, he said, ``the market is correcting to a more
realistic level'' after the frenzied buying of recent years.
   Although Renoirs have not fetched the top prices achieved by van
Goghs, art experts said no Renoir of the caliber of ``Au Moulin de
la Galette'' has been on the auction block.
   Art historian John Rewald has described it as ``the finest work
Renoir painted.''
   Before Thursday's auction, the highest price paid for a Renoir
was $17.7 million in April 1989 for ``La Promenade''; it was bought
by the J. Paul Getty Museum of Malibu, Calif.
   Esterow noted that more Renoirs have been on the market than van
Goghs and that their quality is less consistent. Moreover, he said,
Renoir does not have ``the glamour, the romance, the drama'' of the
troubled van Gogh.
   Renoir painted two versions of ``Au Moulin de la Galette'' in
1876. The one offered for sale at Sotheby's was the property of
Betsey Cushing Whitney, widow of John Hay Whitney, the financier,
publisher and former ambassador to Britain. A larger version hangs
in the Musee d'Orsay in Paris.
   The Whitney picture is painted in a more fluid manner than the
Paris version. However, the two are so similar _ even the ribbons
on the women's dresses are faithfully repeated _ that art experts
dispute which one was painted first.
   Other important works put up for sale at Sotheby's were three
paintings from the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum _ Kandinsky's
``Fugue,'' sold for a record $20.0 million, Modigliani's ``Boy with
a Blue Shirt'' sold for $11.55 million and Chagall's
``Anniversaire'' sold for a record $14.85 million.

<HEAD>U.S. Treats Cigarette Exports as Trade Rather Than Health Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, treating cigarette
exports as a trade rather than health issue, has signalled that
Congress should do likewise.
   Assistant Health Secretary James Mason, who has accused U.S.
tobacco companies of ``peddling their poison abroad,'' was
cancelled as a scheduled witness before a Congressional panel
Thursday.
   The panel chairman, Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., charged at
the hearing and in a letter to Mason's boss, Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, that Mason was being muzzled.
   Sullivan wrote Waxman that his own and Mason's anti-smoking
views would not be silenced, but that it was appropriate for the
administration to be represented at a hearing on exports by the
office of trade representative.
   The General Accounting Office, a Congressional watchdog agency,
meanwhile said in a report that government trade and health
policies appear in conflict, with priority going to export
promotion.
   The GAO said if Congress agrees with this, ``then it should do
nothing to alter the current trade policy process.''
   It added, however, that ``if that Congress believes that health
considerations should have primacy'' -- or should be factored into
trade policy -- it has the option of writing laws giving
responsibility to health authorities. At least one such bill has
been introduced.
   Tobacco trade negotiations with four Asian countries have been
sensitive, the report said, but so far ``there seem to be no
long-term adverse implications for U.S. relations'' with the four.
Talks with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan have boosted U.S.
cigarette sales to those countries. Negotiations with Thailand are
continuing.
   The 50-page report was issued at a five-hour Congressional
hearing on the escalating dispute between the tobacco industry and
anti-smoking groups over government efforts to expand foreign
markets for U.S. cigarettes.
   Waxman told his House subcommittee on health and environment
that ``two days ago the administration informed us they would not
allow'' Mason to testify.
   ``It appears there are officials in the administration who place
greater importance on the export of tobacco -- a product estimated
to kill 2.5 million people annually -- than on the promotion of
international health,'' Waxman said.
   Industry representatives and legislators from tobacco-growing
states maintained that the issue is one of trade in a legal
product, rather than health, and cited tobacco as one of the few
American exports earning a surplus -- $4.2 billion last year.
   They described the current case in Thailand as a matter of
unfair protection for a government tobacco monopoly that is
increasing its own production and exports while using help from the
anti-smoking lobby to ward off foreign competition.

   Here is a chronology of events in the
Bensonhurst racial killing case:
   Aug. 23, 1989 _ Yusuf Hawkins and three friends go to the mostly
white Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn to answer a used-car
advertisement. A gang of about 30 bat-wielding whites attack the
four black youths. Hawkins is shot to death.
   Aug. 25 _ Four are charged in the Hawkins attack.
   Aug. 27 _ Between 30 to 70 blacks march through Bensonhurst as
resident taunt demonstrators and scream ``Niggers go home.''
   Aug. 31 _ Joseph Fama, sought as the triggerman, surrenders in
Oneonta, about 175 miles northwest of New York City.
   Sept. 1 _ Fama pleads innocent to murder and is ordered held in
custody without bail. About 7,500 protesters clash with police at
the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge; 23 police officers and an unknown
number of demonstrators are injured. Four arrested for disorderly
conduct.
   Sept. 7 _ State Supreme Court Justice Thaddeus Owens is selected
to preside in the Bensonhurst case.
   Sept. 12 _ Mayor Edward I. Koch, who had criticized black
protesters who went to Bensonhurst, loses the Democratic primary
mayoral nomination to David Dinkins, who had promised to bring the
city together. Dinkins will go on to become the city's first black
mayor.
   Sept. 18 _ Keith Mondello, Fama and three others plead innocent
to murder. All except for Fama are released on bail.
   March 5 _ Owens delays the start of case so a key witness, John
Vento, can be found.
   March 12 _ Vento, who had surrendered earlier to the FBI in
Ohio, is charged with murder after he reneges on promise to testify.
   April 2 _ Jury selection for state's case against Fama and
Mondello starts. Separate juries are seated because Mondello gave
police a statement identifying Fama as the triggerman.
   May 7 _ Fama jury begins deliberations.
   May 8 _ Mondello jury starts deliberations.
   May 11 _ With a black-led boycott of Korean-American grocery
stores and racial conflict rising as the Bensonhurst juries
continue their deliberations, Mayor David Dinkins makes a televised
plea for racial unity.
   May 17 _ Fama is found guilty of killing Hawkins ``with depraved
indifference for human life'' and a series of lesser charges. He
faces a jail term of 25 years to life on the murder conviction
alone. Mondello deliberations continue.

<HEAD>Van Gogh Purchaser Reportedly Bags Renoir Painting</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Art Market, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The same Japanese businessman who set a record with
his price for a Van Gogh painting has purchased a Renoir
masterpiece for the second-highest price ever recorded, a Japanese
news report said today.
   Industrialist Ryoei Saito bought Renoir's ``Au Moulin de la
Galette'' on Thursday for $78.1 million at an auction at Sotheby's
in New York, the Kyodo News Service reported.
   Van Gogh's ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' was purchased Tuesday by
the Kobayashi Gallery of Tokyo for Saito, the 74-year-old chairman
emeritus of the Daishowa Paper Manufacturing Co.
   ``I haven't heard yet from the art dealer, but if I won the
auction I couldn't be happier,'' Kyodo quoted him as saying after
news of the sale reached Japan this morning.
   ``Works by Van Gogh or Renoir rarely go on sale, so I'm very
fortunate. In addition, I think it is wonderful that they will come
to Japan,'' Kyodo quoted him as saying.
   Prior to its sale, five of the 11 most expensive paintings sold
at auction have been bought by Japanese bidders.
   Saito could not independently be reached for immediate comment,
and Daishowa officials refused to confirm or deny the reports,
saying Saito's activities on the art market were his ``private
affair.''
   The somber portrait by Vincent Van Gogh of his doctor was sold
for $82.5 million _ the highest purchase price ever for a single
painting.
   Though gallery owner Hideto Kobayashi refused to name his
client, Japanese newspapers identified Saito as the buyer.
   Saito, served as president of Daishowa between 1971 and 1982 and
is said to remain its de facto leader. Newspapers said two of his
children are president and chairman of the company.
   His younger brother is state governor of Shizuoka prefecture,
where the Saito clan resides and Daishowa has one of its corporate
headquarters.
   Japanese newspapers said that Saito plans to borrow money on his
considerable land holdings to pay for the two paintings. He is
frequently listed among Japan's richest men. According to the
Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, Saito paid more than $5 million in taxes
last year.
   Known as a veteran art collector, Saito amassed a substantial
collection during the postwar era. However, he had to sell off many
works after the oil shocks of the 1970s, when his paper concern hit
bad times. Profits have since revived, Japanese newspapers said,
enabling him to indulge in his favorite hobby.
   Following the Van Gogh purchase, Saito told the Yomiuri
newspaper: ``It cost 5 billion yen ($33 million) more than I
expected, but that's nothing. Next I want the Renoir.''

<HEAD>Strike Proves Sandinistas Still a Force Despite Defeat at Polls</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After leading a six-day strike by
government employees that nearly paralyzed the country, the
Sandinistas have proven their claim that they can ``govern from
below'' despite their defeat at the polls.
   After pro-U.S. presidential candidate Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro won the Feb. 25 election to end 11 years of Sandinista
rule, leaders of the leftist movement said the could ``tie her
hands'' at any moment.
   And they did just that with the strike, which began barely two
weeks after Mrs. Chamorro took over April 25 as president from
Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega.
   The strike by an estimated 150,000 government employees
disrupted most public services _ government offices, schools, banks
and the international airport were closed.
   The crisis for Mrs. Chamorro's fledgling government ended
Thursday when the strikers vacated government buildings and
returned to work. But the government paid an economic and political
price for the settlement by giving in to the most important demands
of the Sandinista-led strikers.
   ``We were losing $3 million a day in a country that is in
bankruptcy,'' said Central Bank President Francisco Mayorga, when
asked to justify the government concessions to strikers.
   ``It wasn't the workers or the government that won, but
Nicaragua,'' Mayorga said.
   The Chamorro government promised not to fire those who walked
off their jobs and agreed to double salaries for the public
employees as part of the strike settlement.
   That was about half what the Sandinista-dominated unions
originally asked but higher than the 60 percent Mrs. Chamorro
initially offered.
   But there was more at stake in the strike than another blow to
Nicaragua's battered economy. It represented a challenge to the
stability of the new government.
   ``This was ... a coup attempt headed by assailants and
adventurers who checkmated Mrs. Chamorro's democratic government,''
said Alejandro Solorzano, a pro-Chamorro labor leader.
   During Sandinista rule, strikes were banned under a law dealing
with treason, imperialism and foreign aggression.
   The strike, ostensibly for a 200 percent pay raise, turned
political when Mrs. Chamorro suspended a civil service law passed
in the last days of the Sandinista government that guaranteed job
security to public employees, a majority of them Sandinistas.
   The Chamorro government then declared the walkout illegal and
threatened to fire strikers if they didn't return to work. But the
threats proved empty.
   At attempt to use the police, still basically a Sandinista
organization, to break the strike, failed miserably when they
essentially sided with the strikers.
   ``We showed that we govern from below,'' said Denis Silva, a
union leader at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.
   ``It was a victory of the workers and the Sandinistas so why not
call it that?'' said Lucy Savadra, a union leader at the Ministry
of Agriculture.
   Although the Sandinistas won only 40 percent of the vote in
February's elections, they showed they can shut down the country
when they want.
   Thousands of Nicaraguans who supported Mrs. Chamorro at the
polls stood by as the Sandinistas successfully challenged the
government's authority.
   The striking government workers got pay raises of 100 percent
plus an increase in June pegged to inflation.
   They government also nullified its repeal of the civil service
law, promised not to punish strikers and retracted its decree
declaring the strike illegal.
   Despite the settlement, the Sandinistas are likely to bump heads
again soon with the government, which is in the process of revising
property confiscation laws passed by the Sandinistas and overseeing
the disarming of the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   The Contras are supposed to turn in their weapons and disband by
June 10. But only about 1,000 of an estimated 12,000 Contras have
disarmed so far under a program supervised by the United Nations.
The Contras are demanding a reduction in the size of the army and
the resignation of Humberto Ortega, the former Sandinista defense
minister, as head of the armed forces.
   If the Contras don't disarm by the deadline, the Sandinistas are
almost certain to put pressure on the government to take action
against the rebels.
   The government is all the more vulnerable to Sandinista
pressures because it inherited a virtually bankrupt treasury. The
Chamorro administration says the Sandinistas left a paltry $3
million in the state treasury and a foreign debt of $11 billion.
   The country's cash crisis has been deepened by U.S. failure to
provide the emergency aid requested by Mrs. Chamorro.
   A proposed $300 million aid package from the United States is
tied up in Congress and the Bush administration recently said it
cannot legally provide an urgent $40 million bridging loan to help
tide the country over until the package is passed.

<HEAD>Stocks Fall, Dollar Rises in Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange erased
its early gains and edged down Friday, and the dollar rose against
the yen.
   The dollar closed at 152.90, up 0.90 yen from Thursday's close.
The currency opened at 152.30 yen and ranged between 152.25 yen and
153.15 yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost 47.88 points, or 0.15
percent, ending the day at 32,013.72. The index, which had gained
93.98 points Thursday, rose about 140 points in early trading
before falling back.
   ``As market players constantly shifted their target from one
issue to another, trading became directionless and the index began
falling,'' said Kozo Hasunuma, a trader with Yamaichi Securities Co.
   ``The yen's slip, as well as investors' reluctance to make major
moves ahead of the weekend also prompted the fall,'' he added.
   On the foreign exchange market, ``the U.S. currency was pushed
up by scores of dollar-buying by Japanese institutional
investors,'' said Yutaka Hayashi, a dealer with the Mitsui Taiyo
Kobe Bank.
   ``As soon as the dollar jumped over the 152-yen line, which was
one of the resistance points for investors, it also jumped over
153-yen line, another barrier,'' he said.
   Hayashi said the yen's slip showed the market's indecisiveness
over which direction the dollar-yen rate should go followed the
U.S. currency's sharp decline last week and early this week.
   Traders said there was little effect on the dollar from a
wider-than-expected $8.45 billion U.S. trade deficit in March,
announced in Washington Thursday. The March figures were within the
range of earlier expectations, they said.
   Meanwhile, Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said Friday that
the yen is gradually regaining stability in foreign exchange
markets and that it will contribute to reducing trade imbalance
with the United States.
   In the bond market, the price of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond fell to 87.53 from Thursday's close of
87.80. That drove the yield up to 7.055 percent from 7.00 percent.

<HEAD>Foreboding Simmers Under Surface of Anticipated Front Victory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN PETREANU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The main question in Romania's first
free elections in 53 years is not who will win but what the victors
will do to unite their land.
   Will they embrace democracy and capitalism? Or will they, as
opponents allege, find ways to block progress by maintaining the
corrupt and often sinister ``nomenklatura'' that ruled for decades?
   The National Salvation Front and its leader, Ion Iliescu, are
expected to emerge victorious from Sunday's elections. Polls of
uncertain accuracy show Iliescu winning up to 70 percent of the
vote for president and the Front an absolute majority in parliament.
   The Front, a loose coalition of intellectuals and former
Communists, assumed power in the bloody December revolution that
toppled dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. It has dominated the interim
government and makeshift parliament.
   Iliescu is a popular, 60-year-old former minister who was
demoted in the Communist hierarchy after falling out with Ceausescu
in 1971. After Ceausescu's fall, he was named interim president.
   His standing and the Front's popular identification with the
revolution that at least nominally ousted the Communists lend them
a certain legitimacy lacked by reformed Communist parties losing
elections elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
   Unlike Poland, Hungary or Czechoslovakia, Romania had no
organized dissent under communism.
   The main challenge to the Front has come from two reconstituted
pre-World War II parties: the National Peasants Party and the
National Liberal Party. They claim a total of 1.4 million members.
   On Thursday, the last official day of the election campaign,
about 70,000 Front supporters held a rally in north Bucharest,
where Iliescu pledged to ``guarantee the future of democracy'' in
Romania.
   Meanwhile, an estimated 30,000 anti-Iliescu demonstrators
rallied in University Square in downtown Bucharest, where speakers
branded Iliescu a ``neo-Communist.'' It was the largest crowd yet
in a demonstration that has blocked the square and the capital's
main central thoroughfare 24 hours a day since April 22.
   Iliescu and two challengers for the presidency _ the National
Liberal Party's Radu Campeanu and the National Peasants Party's Ion
Ratiu _ held the nation's first-ever televised debate between
presidential candidates Thursday night.
   Eighty-two parties are vying for the votes of 16.8 million
registered voters. But only six _ the Front, the Peasants Party,
the Liberals, the Ecological Party, the Democratic Agrarian Party
and the Social Democrats _ are actually expected to win any of the
506 seats up for grabs in the bicameral Parliament.
   Because all parties back democracy and a free market to rescue
Romania's backward economy, the election campaign centered around
one issue: pro- or anti-Front.
   Massing tens of thousands of supporters chanting slogans similar
to praises once sung of Ceausescu, the Front presented itself as
the party of revolution and guardian of poor people who might be
hurt by a quick dash to capitalism. The Front urges a slower
approach to a free market.
   Its challengers labored to convince voters that the Front
consists of neo-Communists who usurped the revolution. But the
opposition failed to agree on a single challenger to Iliescu.
   Both of the opposition candidates _ Campeanu and Ratiu _ are
elderly, returned exiles vulnerable to Front charges they don't
know today's Romania.
   Whatever the result, the violent election campaign has divided
Romania, where tensions with the ethnic Hungarian minority already
had exploded in March, leaving at least six dead.
   Those who powered the revolution _ the western city of
Timisoara, students and intellectuals elsewhere _ have largely
abandoned the Front and have become a beleaguered minority.
   Cries of ``death to the intellectuals!'' have been heard at
Front rallies.
   Both Ratiu and Campeanu suffered physical assaults for which
their parties blamed the Front. The Peasant Party claims 60 attacks
against it supporters, including two fatal assaults.
   All this has fostered pervasive suspicion and mistrust in a
traditionally byzantine land.
   Hardly anyone knows where the country is headed after the
elections _ and few are sure of what has really happened so far.
   Iliescu, Prime Minister Petre Roman and other leading Front
figures claim to have first met during the revolution.
   Most Romanians accept this version, and Iliescu's repeated
declarations that ``a return to Communism is impossible.''
   Many Romanian intellectuals, their suspicion sharpened by
decades of harsh Communist rule, believe the Front was in effect
formed months ago by disaffected Communists who wanted to dump
Ceausescu and waited for the right moment.
   The intellectuals note that while the 4 million-member Romanian
Communist Party disbanded seemingly overnight, former Communists
still run the country at all levels.
   Unlike other former Communists in Eastern Europe, Iliescu does
not shy away from or apologize for his Communist past. He knows he
cuts a favorable contrast with Ceausescu.
   In a recent TV interview, he said he understood suspicions of
his background, but added such feelings are ``part of the wider
atmosphere of distrust that we will all have to overcome somehow.''

<HEAD>Government Investigating Treatment of Animals from Stranded Soviet
Circus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB McMAHON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The humane society has prodded the U.S.
Department of Agriculture into investigating complaints that a
Soviet circus tour that went bust left some animals cooped up in
undersized cages.
   Bears, chimpanzees and dogs from the Great Circus Bim Bom are
barely able to move in their cages in Newburgh, N.Y., according to
Lisa Landres, an investigator with the Humane Society of the United
States.
   So on Thursday the group's regional office in Flanders, N.J.,
asked the government to look into the case, she said.
   Seven handlers from the circus are caring for the 59 animals,
many of them horses. The company that contracted to transport the
animals is paying to feed them.
   The broke circus performers are stranded at a pair of suburban
Atlanta hotels.
   Ms. Landres said the cages are ``very ramshackle, old and
dilapidated and far too small.'' She said a 7-foot-tall grizzly
bear weighing about 1,000 pounds is bent over in a cage and other
animals are even more cramped.
   ``It's really sad. The three lions are in there like sardines.
The primates are in cages just about the size of their bodies,''
she said. ``The same with the dogs.''
   Agriculture Department spokeswoman Marlene Stinson said a report
on the case will be completed next week. If conditions are found to
be unacceptable, the animals could be moved to better quarters, she
said.
   Ms. Landres said the humane society holds the tour operator
responsible and not the animals' current guardians, the Alex
Nichols Agency Inc. of Elmont, N.Y.
   For its part, the Nichols concern disagreed with the society's
view of the animals' treatment.
   Operations manager Ed Hayes said the agency has spent up to
$5,000 a day to care for the animals and to house their Russian
handlers. He said all but the lions are allowed out of their cages
for exercise.
   ``You just don't take a lion out and walk it around in the
middle of Newburgh,'' Hayes said.
   Hayes said he's offered to place the animals in bigger cages if
the humane society can find some.
   He blames the predicament on the tour operator, International
Showbusiness Inc. of Clearwater, Fla., saying it failed to promote
the shows properly and seek the right backing.
   ``They were not prepared for this circus,'' he said.
   Andy Trueman, the circus' managing director, has attributed the
problems to the tour's original Kuwaiti backers, Waleed A.A. Ahmad
and his father, Khoorsheed Ahmad.
   They withdrew after losing $331,000 and a promised 10 percent of
the receipts, said their lawyer, Brooks Savage. They never intended
to back the whole tour, Savage said.
   The Bim Bom circus performed just two shows before canceling a
scheduled 32-week U.S. tour two weeks ago after running out of
money.
   The 138-member all-star circus, which includes performers from
60 Soviet circuses, arrived in the United States March 31.
   It performed in Hershey, Pa., and Knoxville, Tenn., then
canceled the tour in Johnson City, Tenn., after the trip's backers
withdrew their support. The circus' performers and production staff
moved to suburban Atlanta, where their stays have been supported by
benefactors.
   The animals were trucked from Johnson City to a Newburgh
facility run by the Nichols agency.
   ``They would have been out on the side of the road tied on a
guardrail somewhere if we didn't come along,'' said Hayes.
   The agency is owed $47,000 plus about $30000 more in animal care
expenses, he said.

   The Bensonhurst murder was New York at its
worst: Young men worried about a young woman and turf turned into a
mob when four other youths, of a different race, walked into their
path.
   A gun was fired, a black teen-ager slain. His mistake was to
have entered a mostly white neighborhood on a night when some
frightened toughs were full of adrenaline.
   Thursday, partial resolution of the Aug. 23 killing of
16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins came with the conviction of Joseph Fama,
19, on charges of second degree-murder and 12 other counts.
   A second jury is still out, considering charges against Keith
Mondello for allegedly organizing a gang of 30 friends because a
woman he was interested in dated non-whites. Four other alleged
members of the gang were to be tried later.
   Yusuf Hawkins' death was one more terrible episode for the city
to absorb.
   Since that death, Mayor David Dinkins has taken office, the
first black to run City Hall. Elected to be a healer, he called for
healing after the verdict.
   ``More than 20 years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,
envisioned a promised land where people would be judged by the
content of their character rather than the color of their skin,''
Dinkins said.
   ``I can think of no greater tribute to Yusuf or to his family,
nor a nobler quest for the people of our city, than for us to use
this opportunity to try to make Dr. King's dream a reality.''
   It was Dinkins' third call for racial harmony during a week when
the jury's deliberations had hung like a cloud of question marks
over a city that seemed to be whipped by new racial and ethnic
conflicts each day.
   Last week, well-known newspaper columnist Jimmy Breslin was
temporarily suspended from Newsday for a racial slur against a
Korean-American colleague. On Saturday night, a Vietnamese
immigrant was badly beaten by black youngsters. Administrators at
City College are dealing with two controversial professors, one a
black supremacist, the other a white supremacist.
   In the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, blacks have picketed two
Korean-American-owned grocery stores for months. Dinkins called
last week for the boycotts to end, but the black activists leading
them say he does not represent the interests of the city's black
population.
   The exposure of racial and ethnic wounds is alarming, but it's
nothing new in the nation's largest city.
   ``Yusuf Hawkins died of racism in the first degree,'' Dinkins
said Thursday. ``That is a crime far more common than most of us
are willing to admit.''
   The ``gorgeous mosaic'' that Dinkins celebrated when he was
inaugurated in January has not always held together. But the Fama
verdict helped bring some of the feeling of unity that Dinkins had
sought.
   Demonstrators, who have gathered outside the Brooklyn courthouse
since deliberations began last week, erupted in cheers when the
Fama conviction was announced.
   ``You can smile now,'' one demonstrator, Ronald Anthony, told a
police chief who was standing before a line of officers. The chief
smiled.
   ``A smile is only showing that there's harmony,'' Anthony said a
moment later. ``It made me feel that we can get along.''
   That's an important feeling in New York, but not everyone shares
it.
   Last weekend, as Moses Stewart and Diane Hawkins walked in a
memorial march past the corner where their 16-year-old son was shot
to death, white neighborhood teens shouted ``not guilty, not
guilty'' and ``do the white thing.''
   As Dinkins said recently:
   ``We have a long way to go.''

<HEAD>Vietnamese Priests Put Under Surveillance For `Anti-socialist'
Acts</HEAD>

   Vietnamese authorities have accused two
Roman Catholic priests of ``anti-socialist activities and placed
them under surveillance, official radio said.
   Authorities in Ho Chi Minh City said Vicar Chan Tin must leave
his house and live in his church while Nguyen Ngoc Lan was put
under surveillance in another location, the Voice of Vietnam said.
   A text of the Thursday broadcast was seen in Bangkok today.
   It said the two priests ``were accused of conducting
anti-socialist activities, causing division among religions,
undermining the solidarity between religions and secular life, and
sending documents to other countries with an aim to oppose the
people's authorities.''
   They were put under surveillance Wednesday, it said, ``in order
to safeguard the freedom of belief and to hinder all acts against
law and order.''
   Communist authorities have eased restrictions on Catholics and
other believers since Communist Party chief Nguyen Van Linh came to
power in late 1986.
   But three foreigners who were recently detained for short
periods in Ho Chi Minh City on suspicion of aiding anti-government
activity said authorities were cracking down on dissent there in
advance of Saturday's celebrations marking the 100th anniversary of
the birth of independence leader Ho Chi Minh.
   One of the foreigners, American publisher Mike Morrow, said
Thursday his interrogators expressed concern that dissidents may
try to stage a pro-democracy uprising like that in China last year.

<HEAD>Police Arrest Suspect in Slaying of American Airmen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANGELES, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troops arrested three alleged
Communist guerrillas, one of whom may be involved in the killing of
two American airmen near Clark Air Base, a regional military
commander said today.
   The three suspected members of the Marxist New People's Army
were arrested late Thursday after a gunbattle with troops in a
village on the outskirts of Angeles, about 50 miles north of
Manila, said Lt. Col. Julius Yarcia.
   Among those arrested was Gabriel Warner, 24, who is believed to
be a member of the Mariano Garcia Brigade, a rebel assassination
squad operating near the U.S.-run air base, said Yarcia, the
region's military and police commander.
   The rebels are believed responsible for fatal shootings of
Airman John H. Raven, 19, of Delta Junction, Alaska, and Airman
James C. Green, 20, of Craig, Colo.
   Yarcia said the two other captured rebels, one of them a woman,
were members of a New People's Army support group and were
undergoing further investigation for possible links to the slaying
of the Americans.
   Three other rebels involved in the gunbattle escaped, Yarcia
said.
   Communist rebels have claimed responsibility for Sunday's
killings. They have vowed to continue attacks on Americans until
the six U.S. bases in the Philippines are closed.
   Yarcia said documents captured from the rebels after Thursday's
shootout indicated the guerrillas were planning further attacks
against Americans ``in the next few days.'' He did not elaborate.
   Warner is also a suspect in last year's killing of a prominent
local businessman who supported the bases and in the 1987 killing
of three Americans near Clark, Yarcia said.
   He said about 300 soldiers and police had been sent to search
for more suspects in five slum districts around Clark, which are
believed to be rebel lairs.
   Sunday's attack on the airmen came on the eve of talks that
began Monday between U.S. and Filipino negotiators on extending the
lease for the U.S. bases.
   The agreement that allows the United States to keep the six
bases expires in September 1991.

<HEAD>Candidate Murdered, 3 Killed in Police Firing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least three people were killed when
police fired on a mob that thwarted the arrest of a popular
legislative candidate sought in the slaying of a political rival,
news reports said today.
   Thursday's violence in Haryana state and the fatal shooting of
the candidate prompted the Election Commission to cancel a special
election scheduled for May 26.
   It was the second time the election was delayed in the state
constituency, where Om Prakash Chautala, son of India's deputy
prime minister, needs voter ratification to keep his job as Haryana
state's top official.
   No new voting date has been set.
   United News of India said the trouble started after police
arrived in the town of Medina to arrest Anand Singh Dangi, an
independent candidate and major rival of Chautala. Dangi was sought
in connection with the killing of another independent candidate,
Amir Singh, whose body was found early Thursday in a neighboring
vilage.
   Dangi's supporters hurled stones at police, blocked traffic on a
highway and burned a state-owned bus, the news agency said. Police
filed, killing three people and injuring 10, reports said.
   The independent Hindu newspaper today quoted Medina residents as
saying Chauthala was responsible for Singh's murder because he
feared he would lose and wanted the elections canceled.
   Chautala is running as the candidate of the Janata Dal, a
national party headed by Prime Minister V.P. Singh. Chautala was
appointed chief minister of Haryana state late last year when his
father, Devi Lal, resigned to become Singh's deputy prime minister.
   In order to keep the chief minister's job, Chautala must be
elected to a state legislature seat before June 2.
   The first scheduled election was Feb. 28, but a partial
re-balloting was ordered the next day after Chauthala was accused
of vote fraud, voter intimidation and violence.
   At least eight people were killed when the violence continued
during the March 1 vote. Indian newspapers again blamed Chauthala,
and the Election Commission threw out ballots in the entire
constituency.
   The newspapers said Chauthala resorted to vote fraud because
Dangi had enormous support.
   The ensuing media criticism eroded Chauthala's popularity and
boosted Dangi's chance to win the May 26 election.
   Dangi has not been arrested. The Hindu said his whereabouts were
unknown.
   Violence and fraud during elections are common in India. Last
year's national elections that brought V.P. Singh's National Front
coalition to power were the bloodiest in Indian history. At least
137 people were killed throughout the country.

   Emergency workers turned away curiosity seekers as residents
downstream from a rain-swollen lake dug in to protect their homes
in Texas. Floodwaters covered more than 90,000 acres of farmland in
Louisiana, and two days of heavy rain left families homeless in
Missouri.
   ``I have nothing left,'' said Frank Crouch, leaning on his
mailbox and looking at his mobile home sitting in a pool of water
in Kansas City.
   Oklahoma, Arkansas and Indiana also coped with flooding today.
   Flooding has caused at least 13 deaths in Texas and one in
Oklahoma in the past three weeks, and millions of dollars in damage.
   In Texas, floodwaters from Lake Livingston, about 75 miles
northeast of Houston, are expected to inundate more than 200 square
miles along the Trinity River.
   The Trinity River Authority released water from the rain-swollen
lake at a record rate of 100,800 cubic feet per second early today
as residents prepared for their second week of flooding.
   The most seriously damaged subdivision was Camilla Cove just
below the dam, where more than 75 homes were damaged. Roads looked
like canals, and the water was at window level in some areas.
   ``The waters are still rising,'' said Dean Chapman, 60-year-old
owner of Chapman's Grocery in Walker County. ``It's terrible. The
only way you can get in and out is by boat. It's 10 feet deep
here.''
   About 7,000 people below the dam have been urged for a week to
evacuate as floodwaters rose, but many people remained in their
homes to guard against looting, said San Jacinto County Sheriff's
Deputy M.E. McGregor.
   So far, McGregor said, curiosity seekers have been a bigger
problem. Sightseers in boats have had to be escorted away from
Camilla Cove and swift currents at the dam.
   ``Some of these people sure are crazy,'' McGregor said.
   Texas Gov. Bill Clements asked that three more counties be
declared eligible for disaster aid. Thirty-three counties already
have been declared eligible for federal assistance.
   In Missouri, Gov. John Ashcroft declared Jackson County, which
includes Kansas City, a disaster area.
   ``I've been wearing sunglasses the past two days so people can't
see I'm crying from time to time,'' said David Hill, owner of
Frog's Salvage Co. Hill estimated his losses at $2 million.
   The Mississippi River is expected to crest Saturday at St. Louis
at 34 feet, 4 feet above flood stage. City workers began piling up
sandbags near the city's trademark arch, but officials were not
expecting any damage.
   ``There will be a lot of mud and it won't be pretty, but nothing
should be hurt,'' said Jim Suelman, director of St. Louis' street
department.
   In Lousiana, floodwaters covered more than 90,000 acres of
farmland Thursday and threatened still more as the biggest flood in
33 years moved down the Red River through central Louisiana.
   The Army Corps of Engineers estimated that 350,000 acres of
farmland and nearly as much forest land may be flooded before the
crest disappears next week into the much deeper Atchafalaya River.
   Elsewhere, Oklahoma Gov. Henry Bellmon dispatched a helicopter
and three National Guard soldiers to the southeastern part of the
state to help get feed to more than 200 cattle.
   Floods along the Red and Arkansas rivers have hit southern and
eastern Oklahoma. Bellmon has requested disaster aid for 36 of the
state's 77 counties.
   The Arkansas and Red rivers continued falling, but Wednesday's
heavy rains were expected to produce lowland flooding along the
Black and St. Francis rivers in eastern Arkansas.
   Last week's floods destroyed almost 500 homes and nearly $5
million worth of crops in that state. Twenty counties are under
federal disaster declarations and another 29 have been declared
state disaster areas.
   In southern Indiana, rivers continued to rise early today after
flooding dozens of roads and forcing the evacuation of more than 50
homes.
   Police traveled in boats in French Lick, where water was 5 feet
deep on some streets and a major resort was closed off to cars.
   ``There are a lot of tourists that really think this flood is
it,'' said Geri Kendall, a volunteer at the French Lick Police
Department. ``They're taking pictures and gawking at it.''

   Soon after Joseph Fama was convicted of killing
a black youth in Brooklyn, storm clouds that had hung around the
courthouse for two days moved away, and a shaft of sunlight struck
the building.
   Demonstrators who had angrily chanted themselves hoarse for the
last week hugged each other and smiled at what they seemed to
interpret as a sign from the heavens.
   ``The weather is no joke,'' said Niamah Muhammad, one of about
150 demonstrators outside the Brooklyn courthouse. ``Since the
verdict came, the sun came out. We're all calm and happy. We're all
at peace.''
   ``This is a victory for the people,'' said Dave Walker, an
investigator for a Brooklyn civil rights group. ``The tension's
high throughout the city, throughout the whole country. ... All
communities needed the verdict.''
   When it was announced, some demonstrators erupted in cheers and
high-fives while others hugged each other and vowed to return to
the courthouse to await verdicts in the trials of six others
charged in the death of 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins.
   Activists who had warned of unrest in the event of an acquittal
greeted the conviction warmly.
   About 150 police officers were on the street outside the
courthouse and 150 on other streets nearby, with perhaps 150 news
reporters. Before word of the verdict arrived the mood was somber,
but it quickly turned to glee.
   ``You can smile now,'' one demonstrator, Ronald Anthony, told a
police chief who was standing before a line of officers. The chief
smiled.
   ``A smile is only showing that there's harmony,'' Anthony said.
``It made me feel that we can get along.''
   ``I think it's the start of some kind of change in America,''
said demonstrator Melanie Stewart. ``I think this is the start of
something progressive.''
   Still, she spoke of compassion for Fama: ``I kind of feel sorry
for him. He made a stupid move. There were other ways to deal with
the situation. There may have been peer pressure.''

<HEAD>More French Jews Seeking to Emigrate to Israel</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More French Jews have sought to emigrate to Israel
in the week since vandals desecrated a Jewish cemetery in southern
France than in the more than four-month period preceding the
incident, the Jewish Agency said.
   Vandals broke 34 tombstones at the Jewish cemetery in Carpentras
and dug up the body of an 81-year-old man and impaled his remains
on an umbrella pole.
   Since the desecration was discovered May 10, 2,000 emigration
requests have been received, Jewish Agency official Claude Laloum
said Thursday. Between Jan. 1 and May 9, there were 1,800 such
requests.
   The agency, which has offices in many countries, helps make
arrangements for Jews seeking to settle in Israel.
   Since the desecration at Carpentras, there have been almost
daily incidents of vandalism.
   In the latest incident, about 100 graves at a Roman Catholic
cemetery outside the Atlantic Coast city of Nantes were damaged or
painted with graffiti. One slogan said ``Carpentras will be
avanged'' and another said ``Death to Le Pen,'' referring to
far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, who has been widely accused of
promoting racial and religious animosities.
   In the Paris suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois, police said 12 people _
most with far-right connections _ had been detained in connection
with the painting of swastikas on 32 graves at a Jewish cemetery
late Sunday or early Monday.
   In Canada, meanwhile, the desecration of a Jewish cemetery in
Ste-Foy, outside Quebec City, was discovered Thursday.
   Vandals painted swastikas and white power slogans at the
cemetery, police said.
   Laloum said the possibility of moving to Israel ``exists in the
minds of all Jews, at all times. It crystallizes when there is an
emotional shock as is the case with Carpentras.
   ``The decision to leave France for Israel is not a way of
protesting against anti-Semitism,'' he said. ``Jews have had the
illusion that anti-Semitism was disappearing, but with a shock like
Carpentras, the illusion shatters.''
   He said the Jewish Agency receives about 4,000 to 5,000 requests
yearly. About 1,200 people actually leave France and settle in
Israel.

   A two-time killer went to his death in the
Louisiana electric chair today despite worldwide protests that he
was dying for a crime he committed as a brain-damaged teenager.
   In a rambling, barely audible final statement, Dalton Prejean
said his death would serve no purpose.
   ``One mistake ... 13 years ago, and that's a long time,'' he
said. ``Nothing is going to be accomplished. I have peace with
myself.''
   Prejean, 30, was condemned for the 1977 murder of Donald
Cleveland, a Louisiana state trooper who was shot in the face when
he stopped Prejean for driving with a broken tail light.
   ``To the Cleveland family, they say it wasn't for the revenge,
but it's hard for me to see, to understand,'' Prejean said. ``I
hope they're happy.''
   He was pronounced dead at 12:17 a.m. The execution was the
nation's third in 24 hours. Texas and Missouri each executed
killers early Thursday. Since capital punishment resumed in 1977,
128 prisoners have been executed in the nation, 19 in Louisiana.
   Prejean was the first to die under the Supreme Court's ruling
last year that allowed the death penalty for crimes committed by
16- and 17-year olds.
   He had been on the Louisiana death row 10 years, longer than any
other inmate. In his persistent legal fight which reached the U.S.
Supreme Court four times, he went through a dozen attorneys and won
10 delays of execution.
   The way was cleared for the execution about 7 p.m., when the
U.S. Supreme Court refused to step in again.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer also refused to intervene. He rejected the
recommendation of his pardon board who had voted to commute the
sentence to life in prison.
   When Prejean was 14, he shot and killed a taxi driver; for that,
he spent 30 months in reform school. He was released without
supervision, and six months later he shot Cleveland.
   Prejean's case captured widespread attention. Opponents cited
his youth at the time of the crime. They said he shot the trooper
after a night of alcohol and drugs.
   They argued he had an IQ of 71 and was brain damaged, apparently
from abuse by an aunt who raised him. They noted he was black,
convicted by an all-white jury.
   ``I doubt that in documented recent world history there is an
execution ... that has such a pile of reasons not to do it,'' said
Steve Herrick, southern regional director for Amnesty International.
   More than 1,000 letters flooded the state capital this week,
many from overseas.
   In Strasbourg, France, the European Parliament on Thursday
called for commutation of the sentence and a review of the evidence.
   Two state troopers were among the witnesses for Prejean's
electrocution. No one from Cleveland's family was present.
   Outside the prison gates, a group of 10 supporters of the death
penalty held a quiet vigil. Several were relatives of murder
victims.
   The warden gave the signal and alternating blasts of electricity
were sent through Prejean's body _ 2,000 volts for 10 seconds, 500
for 20 seconds, 2,000 for 10, and 500 for 20.
   In Thursday's executions, Leonard Laws, 40, was put to death by
injection in Missouri for the robbery and shotgun slayings of an
elderly couple. In Texas, Johnny Ray Anderson, 30, was executed by
injection for a 1981 slaying that was part of a scheme to collect
$67,000 in insurance money.

   Jurors said prosecutors failed to prove Joseph
Fama shot Yusuf Hawkins as they had charged, but said they believed
his role as a member of the white mob that surrounded and killed
the black teen-ager was enough to convict him of murder.
   ``I feel that he had the choice, if he knew what was going on,
to leave the area. To act with a mob is depraved indifference to
me. I've seen mobs and it becomes one entity, as opposed to
individuals,'' said the jury forewoman, Tonya Bailey.
   ``I was personally convinced that he was the shooter, but there
was not enough evidence for me to convict him of that,'' she added.
   As Bailey, a professor at Brooklyn Technical College, delivered
her verdict about 7 p.m. Thursday, several jurors wiped away tears.
   ``The sympathy that we feel for both families made it very
difficult,'' said Kelley Freer, a young bank employee. An hour
after the verdict was delivered, her eyes still were red from
weeping.
   Bailey and the 11 other jurors in the Brooklyn court convicted
Fama a day after Judge Thaddeus Owens had instructed them that the
19-year-old defendant could be found guilty of second-degree murder
even if he only took part in the attack.
   ``He is just as liable if he contributed to the realization of
the plan _ if he helped or made it possible,'' Owens told the
jurors.
   Nine of the jurors agreed to speak with reporters after
delivering their verdict.
   Steven Berquist, a telephone company worker, was the last
holdout on the jury, and agreed to vote for a guilty verdict on the
murder count on Thursday morning as the panel entered its 11th day
of deliberations.
   ``If I had any reasonable doubt, I wouldn't have convicted,'' he
said.
   Debbie Cose and Michele Gardner, two of the three black jurors,
said while the case was one of the most racially charged in the
city, race played no role in the difficult deliberations.
   ``We put that aside in the jury room,'' said Cose, a secretary
in an accounting firm.
   ``We were family for 11 days,'' said Gardner.
   The jury went as long as seven days without taking a vote while
they deliberated, a report in today's Daily News said.

   A train carrying more than 100 people
through Alpine passes today struck a mudslide and derailed, killing
the engineer, the national railway announced.
   There were no other casualties, said a spokesman for the Societe
Nationale des Chemins de Fer.
   The accident on the train from Ventimiglia, Italy to Geneva
occurred near the French village of Beaulieu as the 100 passengers
slept, the railway spokesman said.
   The lead engine struck a mass of mud and debris that slid onto
the tracks during a heavy storm. The engine separated from the rest
of the train and tumbled 100 feet down an embankment, the company
said.
   The engineer died instantly, the railway spokesman said. The
passengers were evacuated by bus to the Grenoble train station and
boarded other trains to continue their journey.
   The accident delayed rail traffic in the region for several
hours, the railway said.

   Sammy Davis Jr. never shied from the
spotlight while living, and his family has continued the tradition
by opening today's funeral service to the public.
   The invitation was as popular as any of the late song-and-dance
man's movies. Officials at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the
Hollywood Hills expected as many as 6,000 fans for the 11 a.m.
service.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson was scheduled to speak, along with
Gregory Hines, who co-starred with Davis in the film ``Tap.''
Longtime friend Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson were among the
invited celebrities.
   Davis died of throat cancer Wednesday at the age of 64.
   Members of his staff and band were to serve as pallbearers at
the non-denominational service.
   Exterior lights and marquees at resorts along the Las Vegas
Strip will go dark for 10 minutes tonight in memory of Davis, who
entertained millions in the city over four decades.
   Funerals and memorials for Hollywood stars tend to be exclusive.
A tribute to Bette Davis earlier this year was limited to several
hundred invited guests and when Lucille Ball was buried last year,
the public was informed only after the small service was completed.
   Marilyn Monroe, John Wayne, Natalie Wood, Fred Astaire and Cary
Grant also were memorialized in private services.
   When celebrities have been honored publicly, they have often
drawn overflow crowds. Among the more popular services in recent
years have been those for Freddie Prinze, Marvin Gaye and Ricky
Nelson.
   In lieu of flowers, Davis' family has suggested that donations
be made to the Sammy Davis Jr. National Liver Institute at the
University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.

   Light showers fell over parts of the Northeast early today, and
an unseasonably strong jet stream pushed rain systems eastward from
the Rockies.
   Most of the nation had fair or partly cloudy skies early today.
   Scattered showers were forecast across much of the Great Plains,
and the system was expected to move swiftly past the East Coast
over the weekend.
   Advisories for frost or freezing temperatures were posted
overnight over parts of Minnesota and North Dakota.
   Rain was forecast over the middle section of Florida and in
parts of Montana.
   More thunderstorms were forecast for the southern Plains, where
rainfall during the past three weeks has caused heavy flooding.
   Flooding plagued Indiana, Kansas and Missouri on Thursday, and
the National Weather Service predicted heavy flooding to continue
in Louisiana for the next two weeks.
   Also Thursday, winds gusted to 80 mph at Owego, N.Y., and
thunderstorms across the state caused heavy flooding at Utica.
   The nation's high for Thursday was 101 degrees at Phoenix.

   A toy maker announced today that it plans to sell
Gorby dolls beginning next month, and a similar model you can
really bank on.
   One doll, which Tokyo-based Avanti Co. is basing on Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev, is about 10 inches tall and dressed in a
fake leather or denim jacket or a sweat shirt. When its stomach is
squeezed, the doll slightly opens its mouth and makes a squeaky
cry. The price: $25.
   A simpler 8-inch ``Gorby bank'' model, in orange, green, red or
black, will cost the equivalent of about $12, a spokesman for
Avanti said.
   ``I hope we can make politics more of an everyday thing by
introducing such toys,'' said Avanti spokesman Tomoki Kajiwara.
   ``Although we made this `Gorby' look cute in order to attract
children and young women, I think intellectuals or male college
students will be mainly interested. We are quite curious to know
who would buy them.''
   He said 500,000 of the dolls would be produced initially, with
additional production for sales in the United States and Europe
later this year.

   When Stacey Hoover was growing up on a
poultry farm, her mother teased her that she'd be married in a
turkey barn.
   Miss Hoover will have the last laugh Saturday, when she marries
Mark Butcher in a barn that housed 6,000 turkeys until two weeks
ago.
   ``Mark and I have close to 225 people coming to our wedding, and
there is no church big enough in Newport to hold that many
people,'' said Miss Hoover, 23. ``So I decided, why not get married
in one of our turkey barns?''
   The Hoovers have two farms in the Newport area, and they own a
meat and produce store and farm near Mechanicsburg. Miss Hoover
runs the store while her fiance, whom she met four years ago while
they were college students, manages the farm operations.
   The bride-to-be said her parents, Jim and Sandra Hoover, support
her plans.
   ``At first, they laughed,'' she said. ``Then they found out that
we meant it.''
   The turkeys have been moved out to make way for wedding guests,
flowers, an organ and a harp.
   Miss Hoover she plans a ``very traditional service _ as serious
as if we were in church.''
   After the ceremony, the guests will head to a reception at the
Carlisle Country Club, where they will feast on roast turkey.
   Miss Hoover said her married name will be Butcher, ``which is
good since we own a butcher shop.''

<HEAD>Dollar Firms Save Against Pound, Gold Rebounds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was lower today against the surging
pound sterling but gained against most other currencies in European
trading.
   Gold bounced back from a brief dip in Far Eastern trading but
activity was light.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 152.90 yen, up 0.90 yen from
Thursday's 152-yen finish. Later in London the dollar was quoted at
152.80 yen.
   The pound, boosted by speculation that Britain was preparing to
join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, was quoted in London at
1.6938, up from 1.6905 late Thursday.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday:
   _1.6488 West German marks, up from 1.6474
   _1.4030 Swiss francs, down from 1.4049
   _5.5540 French francs, up from 5.5510
   _1.8520 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8430
   _1211 Italian lire, up from 1210.50
   _1.1743 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1738
   Andrew Ellott, foreign exchange economist at Chase Investment
Bank, said that a lot of ``hype'' helped elevate the pound but that
buying interest had been broad.
   Ellott said European Exchange Rate Mechanism entry will probably
be made at between 2.60 and 2.70 West German marks with the
government opting initially for a wide 6 percent fluctuation band
around the central rate.
   Thus, he said, speculation about entry over the next few months
will provide a solid base for the pound and probably boost its
trading range to 2.75 and 2.82 marks and $1.67 and $1.73.
   David Simmonds, Treasury economist at Midland Bank PLC,
predicted the pound would consolidate recent gains but it could
decline later in the summer on fears that the government will cut
interest rates as soon as inflation turns down.
   In Tokyo, the U.S. currency rose early in the day as market
players bought the West German mark and sold the yen. It also
gained strength from dollar-buying by Japanese institutional
investors, said Masao Kanemaru, a dealer with Fuji Bank.
   Dealers said a wider-than-expected $8.45 billion U.S. trade
deficit in March, announced Thursday, were close to expectations
and had little impact on exchange rates.
   ``Market players generally believe the dollar will still remain
weak, and move narrowly a little above 150 yen until there is major
market-affecting news,'' Kanemaru said.
   Gold dealers in London fixed a recommended price of $369.70 per
troy ounce this morning, up from $369.25 bid late Thursday.
   At 6 a.m. EDT, gold traded in Zurich at $369.50, up from $369
bid late Thursday.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose 15 cents an ounce this morning, to close
at $370.30.
   Silver bullion traded at $5.05 a troy ounce, unchanged from late
Thursday.

<HEAD>Marlon Brando's Eldest Son Arrested Following Shooting at Estate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marlon Brando's eldest son, Christian, may
have killed his half-sister's boyfriend in self-defense, says
lawyer William Kunstler, who will defend the younger Brando.
   ``I understand there may have been a struggle over the gun, and
some beating going on of Marlon's daughter,'' the radical attorney
said Thursday. Kunstler, a friend of Brando's from civil rights
struggles, said he received a call from him at 2 a.m. Thursday just
after the shooting.
   Christian Brando, 32, was scheduled to be arraigned today in the
slaying of Dag Drollet, 26, of Tahiti, who had been staying at the
Brando estate. Kunstler was reportedly flying to Los Angeles from
New York for the arraignment.
   Police said the shooting was sparked by an argument over
Drollet's treatment of 20-year-old Tarita Cheyenne Brando,
Christian's pregnant half-sister.
   ``There were allegations that there was physical abuse, a
beating,'' Lt. Ron Hall said.
   ``There was no indication there had been a physical altercation
prior to the shooting,'' said police Detective Steve Osti.
   The actor's son was arrested Wednesday night and booked for
investigation of murder, said Hall. He was held without bail
pending arraignment.
   ``He admitted to the shooting,'' the lieutenant said.
   Drollet was a family friend who had been a guest in the home for
10 days, police said. He died instantly from a .45-caliber bullet
to the head, police said. Coroner's office spokesman Bob Dambacher
said an autopsy was planned today.
   Marlon Brando, 66, placed the 911 emergency call to report a
shooting inside his Mulholland Drive estate Wednesday night, police
said.
   Christian Brando was alone with Drollet when the shooting
occurred and the Oscar-winning actor, his wife and daughter were in
another wing of the sprawling mansion and didn't witness the
shooting, Hall said.
   Tarita Cheyenne is the daughter of Brando and his current wife,
Tarita Teriipia, a Tahitian actress who played his love in the 1962
remake of ``Mutiny on the Bounty.''
   Brando's two other sons, Miko and Simon, were not at the estate
at the time.
   Officers recovered the pistol used in the killing and
confiscated other weapons, including an M14 carbine, a shotgun and
an Uzi assault rifle.
   ``I don't want these guns here. Take these guns out of here,''
Marlon Brando was quoted as telling police.
   Christian is the son of the actor and his first wife, Anna
Kashfi. The couple was divorced in 1960, and their troubled son was
the subject of a bitter custody battle.
   The 32-year-old high school dropout struggled to find a role of
his own in life. He learned artistic welding, attempted to start a
tree trimming service and tried acting.
   In October 1987, the younger Brando worked on his first _ and
apparently only _ movie. He played a hit man in an Italian film
produced under the Italian title ``La Posta in Gioco'' that was
called both ``Up for Grabs'' and ``The Stakes'' in English.
   Except for traffic tickets, Christian Brando has no police
record.
   Marlon Brando won best actor Oscars in 1954 for ``On the
Waterfront'' and in 1972 for ``The Godfather.'' He was nominated
for Best Support Actor for his 1989 role in ``A Dry White Season.''

<HEAD>35 Injured in Car Bombing in Cartagena</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded at a shopping center
in the resort city of Cartagena, and its mayor said at least 35
people were injured.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing
Thursday, but the government has blamed all of the more than 200
bombings nationwide since August on drug traffickers. Those attacks
have resulted in the deaths of 259 people.
   Cartagena, a city of 300,000 on the Caribbean coast, was a
popular tourist resort for Americans until a bomb set off by drug
traffickers exploded last year in the Hilton Hotel, killing two
people. It remains one of Colombia's top local vacation spots.
   Thursday's bomb exploded at the Boca Grande shopping center in
the heart of the high-rise hotel and condominium district, Gov.
Guillermo Pinazo of Bolivar state said in an interview with the
radio network RCN.
   At least 35 were injured by the blast, which cut off electricity
and telephone service to much of the downtown area in that city of
300,000 residents, said Cartagena Mayor Manuel Domingo Rojas.
Twelve vehicles were also destroyed by the bomb, which was placed
in a car stolen hours earlier.
   Earlier Thursday in the capital, Bogota, police discovered a
truck bomb with 660 pounds of dynamite. The device, capable of
leveling a large residential area, was found buried in a cargo of
beans in the back of a truck, police said.
   Three car bombs exploded Saturday _ two outside shopping centers
in Bogota _and killed 28 people.
   The crackdown on traffickers began nine months ago after a
presidential hopeful of the governing Liberal Party, Luis Carlos
Galan, was assassinated during a campaign speech. President
Virgilio Barco said drug traffickers were responsible.
   Since then, two more presidential candidates have been killed:
Bernardo Jaramillo and Carlos Pizarro. Both were leftists. The
police said drug traffickers hired the assassins.
   Public campaigning for Colombia's May 27 presidential election
ends today.
   Twelve candidates are seeking election, but only four are
considered serious contenders.
   They include Cesar Gaviria, of the Liberal Party; Rodrigo
Lloreda of the Conservative Party; Avlaro Gomez of a splinter group
of the Conservative Party; and Navarro Wolf, a member of a recently
disbanded guerrilla group.
   Gaviria and Wolf have said the government must keep fighting
traffickers. Lloreda and Gomez have said they favor conciliatory
gestures toward the traffickers in order to stop their terrorist
attacks.

<HEAD>Chicago Outbreak Among Children Exemplifies National Measles
Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal health officials say the big-city
outbreaks which have fueled a fourfold jump in measles in the
United States will continue if urban child vaccination efforts are
not more successful.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that
at least 2,621 measles cases have occurred in Chicago since
Valentine's Day 1989. Eight patients have died, and the outbreak is
continuing.
   Seventy-five percent of the Chicago cases in 1989 occurred in
children under 5 _ too young to be covered by school vaccination
laws.
   ``We have a way of confidently assuring that everybody is
immunized by the time they go to school,'' said CDC Director
William L. Roper. ``We do not have a similar mechanism for rounding
up every 15-month-old. ... This is not a police state.''
   Three out of four Chicago measles patients in 1989 had never
been vaccinated.
   Blacks accounted for 71 percent, and Hispanics accounted for 23
percent of the patients. The outbreak has centered on preschool
children in poorer inner-city neighborhoods, as did outbreaks last
year in Houston and Los Angeles.
   ``If coverage with at least one dose of vaccine is not increased
among inner-city preschool-aged children, additional outbreaks of
measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases can be expected,''
the CDC said.
   Together, the Houston, Los Angeles and Chicago outbreaks
accounted for 35 percent of the 17,850 cases reported nationwide in
1989. That total was up dramatically from 3,411 cases in 1988.
   ``The problem with measles,'' Roper said, ``is it's an
immunization delivered at 15 months of age. ... The challenge we
face is how, as a nation, to reach particularly inner city,
particularly poor, particularly young, particularly single mothers,
to bring their children to get them immunized _ when getting that
immunization at 15 months of age is surely not the number one item
on their minds at that moment.''
   The Chicago Department of Health reported that vaccination
levels among 2-year-olds in high inner-city measles areas averaged
just 49 percent.
   The preschool population in such areas ``often has limited
contact with the health-care system,'' the CDC said, urging
stronger efforts to make vaccinations available.
   Measles had dwindled to 1,497 U.S. cases in 1983 before an
upswing in recent years and the large increase in 1989.
   The availability of measles vaccine in the past three decades
has reduced the disease by 95 percent or more. However, some
vaccine failures do occur; nearly 40 percent of the cases last year
occurred in people who had been vaccinated.
   To combat that, the CDC now recommends measles vaccine at 15
months, with a booster shot at school age.

<TEXT>
   President Carlos Menem has
refused to discuss widely published reports he moved out of his
official residence because of a rift with his wife, who has
increasingly criticized his government.
   Reports that Menem, 59, plans to divorce or permanently separate
from his 46-year-old wife, Zulema, took front-page headlines in
most Argentine newspapers Wednesday and Thursday.
   Questioned during a meeting Thursday with foreign
correspondents, Menem refered reporters to an official communique,
which said he would ``abstain from any public statements on the
matter.''
   ``I'm not a man who has gone through life on a bed of roses,''
Menem added as he left the meeting. ``I`ve been through everything
in my life and I'm galvanized, strengthened spiritually to be able
to put up with any kind of situation.''
   The furor over the future of the marriage was touched off
Wednesday by the weekly newsmagazine Somos, which said Menem had
moved out of the residence on May 8 and planned a ``de facto
estrangement'' from his wife.
   Menem's departure from the official residence, Somos said, was
provoked by a crisis in his 24-year marriage that threatens ``to
become a question of state.''
   Presidential aides refused to officially confirm or deny the
reports.
   Menem, who led the labo-based Peronist Party to victory in May
1989 elections, has surprised many Argentines, including party
members, with efforts to exchange the heavily state-controlled
economy for a free market economy as a means of ending decades of
inflation and recession.
   Zulema Menem, described publicly by her husband as ``one of my
harshest critics,'' has frequently spoken out in support of a
Peronist faction that opposes Menem's plans to relax government
controls, sell money-losing state companies, deregulate monopolies,
end subsidies and lower trade barriers.
   Mrs. Menem, who claimed recently that she had received anonymous
death threats, also has charged that her husband is surrounded by
corrupt or untrustworthy aides and advisors and has accused several
top officials of unspecified misdeeds.
   The first lady maintains close friendships with several of her
husband's leading political foes, including labor leader Saul
Ubaldini and Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin, leader of a right-wing
army faction that opposes the army heirarchy and staged three
barracks revolts in 1987 and 1988.
   The couple has two children, Zulema Eva, 19, and Carlos, 21.

   The son of a former Panamanian president
was found innocent of threatening to kill President Bush, but he
was loath to talk about the verdict.
   ``Talking is how I got into this mess,'' Otto Lakas said
Thursday as he left U.S. District Court.
   Lakas was accused of threatening to kill Bush while talking with
the managers of a pawnshop where he was looking at a gun. The
21-year-old architecture student at Lubbock Christian University
admitted making the menacing comments but said they were made in
jest.
   Jailed since his April 17 arrest by the Secret Service, he could
have faced a five-year prison term if convicted.
   ``I am very happy,'' Lakas said. ``I don't want to comment any
more than that, but I am glad to go back home'' to Panama.
   Demetrio Lakas, president of Panama from 1972 to 1978, testified
Thursday that death threats in Panama ``are a way of expressing
ourselves.''
   After hearing the jury's decision, he cried and hugged his wife,
Elizabeth.
   Prosecutors refused to comment about the decision.
   During testimony Thursday, the younger Lakas told jurors he did
say, ``I have a bullet with Bush's name engraved on it'' while
talking to pawnshop managers Stacy and Tracy Nichols last month.
   ``I apologize for making the statement,'' Lakas said under
cross-examination Thursday. ``I didn't mean it.''
   Lakas' lawyer, Tommy Turner, told jurors in closing arguments
that his client made the threat after the pawnbrokers teased him
about the U.S. invasion of Panama last December.
   The Nicholses said during testimony Wednesday that they had
refused to believe Lakas' father was a former Panamanian president,
and taunted Lakas when he told them U.S. troops entered his home
and confiscated his father's gun collection.
   ``Otto used an exaggeration to make a point,'' Turner told the
jurors. ``But you can't throw a man in jail for shooting his mouth
off.''
   Bush sent U.S. troops into Panama in December, which resulted in
the arrest and removal of Panama's dictator, Gen. Manuel Noriega.
Lakas' father was a figurehead president of Panama when it was
ruled by Gen. Omar Torrijos. Noriega was a follower of Torrijos who
rose to power after Torrijos died in a 1981 plane crash.

few days for Japan, where organizers hope to obtain necessary radio
equipment that Taiwan has refused to allow onto the vessel.
   Nicholas Druz, chairman of the project, said Taiwan stymied it
by refusing to allow Chinese to board the ship to make broadcasts,
not allowing the ship to return for provisions, and stopping the
transmitter from clearing customs.
   He also said the United States has long been putting pressure on
Taiwan not to assist the ship, but he did not explain why
Washington might do that.
   A spokesman for the U.S. representative in Taipei refused to
comment.
   The Taiwanese government issued a statement reiterating its
stance that the radio equipment would not be allowed aboard the
ship because the planned broadcasts would violate international law.
   Taiwan ``is without exception supportive of efforts to foster
democracy on the Chinese mainland,'' government spokesman Shaw
Yu-ming said. But ``even for a worthy end, the Republic of China
(Taiwan) cannot support an illegal means.''
   Organizers deny that the broadcasts would violate international
law.
   The 1,200-ton vessel, which left France on March 17, arrived in
Keelung on Sunday to take on provisions before sailing into
international waters to make the broadcasts. The departure has been
delayed several days because of all the difficulties organizers
have encountered.
   Although Taiwan's governing Nationalist Party is the rival of
the Beijing government, tension between the two sides has eased in
recent years and Taiwan is anxious not to anger the Communists, who
have refused to rule out the use of force to stop the broadcasts.
   China has repeatedly warned Taiwan not to help the Goddess of
Democracy.
   Druz and other organizers, speaking at a news conference, said
they felt betrayed by the government. They claimed assurances were
made that they would have had a more favorable reception here.
   He acknowledged the project was about $500,000 in debt, and
organizers made an appeal for radio stations around the world to
help find a transmitter to be loaded onto the boat in Japan. He
said the equipment was needed to make the broadcasts.
   ``We don't want to terminate this project,'' said Druz, who
fought back tears as he answered questions. ``We still hope we can
broadcast before the Fourth of June.''
   He was referring to the first anniversary of the military
crackdown of the pro-democracy movement in Beijing in which
hundreds and possibly thousands of civilians were killed. The ship
is named after the statue erected by demonstrators in Tiananmen
Square that was crushed that night by tanks.

   Moscow police are preparing to snoop on American
law enforcers from New York to California, from squad rooms to back
yard barbecues.
   Thirteen of the Moscow men in blue are scheduled to arrive in
the United States today for a weeklong visit being billed as the
first official bilateral law enforcement exchange with the Soviets.
   ``They are basically interested in everything we have to show
them,'' said Cynthia Dickstein, president of the Organization for
America-Soviet Exchanges, a private, non-profit agency that
arranged the visit. ``The programs set up for them are pretty
inclusive: drugs, canine units, all the equipment, ballistics,
courtrooms, jails, crime labs.''
   The 13 Soviet officers are men between the ages of 27 and 45 who
hold executive positions in what amounts to the Moscow bureau of
the Soviet national police force. They include the colonel in
charge of Moscow's criminal investigation unit, officers who police
the black market and a captain in the traffic department.
   The Soviet officers, who will stay in the homes of local police,
will visit police departments in Albany, Amsterdam and Rochester in
upstate New York; New London, Conn.; DeLand, Fla.; and Larkspur,
Calif.
   This fall, 13 U.S. officers will make a similar visit to the
Soviet Union.
   Soviet officials last year said their country had the
fastest-growing crime rate in the world, but still trailed behind
the United States in overall crimes.
   In the first eight months of 1989, more than 1.5 million crimes
were reported in the Soviet Union, a 33.2 percent jump over the
same period the year before, Soviet officials said.
   Still, Soviet officials said there are only 5.9 murders per
100,000 Soviets, compared with 8.9 per 100,000 in America.
   The visits are expected to combine socializing with a
demonstration of local police work.
   Volusia County Sheriff's Sgt. Bob Matusick in DeLand, Fla.,
plans to treat Col. V.T. Bobryashov to a back yard cookout and
swings to Disney World and Kennedy Space Center along with visits
to the state crime lab in Orlando and the Blue Lightning Strike
Force in Miami.
   Matusick, who led American law enforcement officers on a
two-week trip to the Soviet Union last month, said Bobryashov and
his colleagues will likely be amazed by U.S. law enforcement
technology.
   While in Moscow, he felt as if he had ``stepped back in time to
the 1950s,'' Matusick said. ``There are no computers in common
use.''
   Steretypes probably will be broken on both sides, said Dickstein.
   She said U.S. police who visited the Soviet Union found common
ground with police officers there.
   On both sides, they groused about low pay, inadequate benefits,
low prestige in the community, she said.
   The benefit of the exchanges, she said, is that they give people
the chance to see for themselves what they only imagined.
   ``It breaks down the stereotypes. There's so much mystique about
police,'' Dickstein said. ``Police in the Soviet Union saw `Police
Academy' (a slapstick comedy about training) and they wanted to
know if that was what it's really like.''
   The Americans expected their Soviet counterparts to be less
friendly and more stern, she said. ``You had visions of Soviet
police taking people off to the camps.''
   Instead, the officers squared off for a game of basketball in
Lithuania. The Soviets were gracious enough to let the American
lose by only a little, she said.

<HEAD>Red Cross Contacted About Hostage Swap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Lebanese Shiite militia has contacted the Red
Cross concerning an offer to swap the bodies of two Israeli
soldiers for Israeli-held Arab prisoners, a Red Cross spokeswoman
said today.
   ``I can confirm that Amal, (a Shiite militia), has resumed
contacts with us on the subject,'' said spokeswoman Martine
Haemmerli.
   She said the militia and Israel first contacted the
International Committee of the Red Cross on the proposed swap some
time ago. She refused to elaborate.
   An Israeli defense official said in Jerusalem on Thursday that
Israel wants proof that Amal is holding the bodies of the two
soldiers killed in south Lebanon before considering a swap.
   Such an exchange with the mainstream Amal militia could
encourage more releases of Western hostages held in Lebanon by
pro-Iranian Shiite radicals. There are now 16 Western hostages,
including six Americans.
   After two U.S. hostages were freed last month, Iran and allied
groups in Lebanon demanded a goodwill gesture, such as the release
of prisoners held by the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army, which
has more than 300 prisoners.
   The Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Amal had been claiming for some time that it was holding the bodies
but had never produced evidence. Most of the seven Israeli
servicemen missing in Lebanon are believed to be in the hands of
radical Iranian-backed or Palestinian groups.
   ``As far as we know the Amal organization does not have the
bodies of any of our soldiers,'' he said. ``If Amal believes the
bodies are those of Israeli soldiers, let it first submit evidence
to this effect. Only after we are convinced the bodies are in fact
those of Israeli soldiers will there be room to negotiate the
matter.''
   U.N. sources in south Lebanon disclosed Thursday that in early
1989 Amal leader Nabih Berri approached United Nations officials
and offered to return Israeli bodies given to them by the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   In exchange, Berri sought the release of Shiite prisoners held
in al-Khiam, a prison controlled by the South Lebanon Army.
   The sources, who demanded anonymity, said Berri never identified
the bodies of the soldiers he was offering to trade. They said
Israel demanded proof and suggested evidence be given to
representatives of the International Red Cross.
   The negotiations were halted after battles broke out between
rival Shiite groups, and Israel captured Shiite Sheik Abdul Karim
Obeid in July.
   Last week, the commander of the South Lebanon Army, Gen. Antoine
Lahad, refused to make prisoner releases solely to help Western
hostages.
   He said three captured Israeli soldiers and missing militiamen
from his own army would have to be part of any deal.
   The longest held of the 16 Western hostages is Terry A.
Anderson, 42, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press.
   He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Freed Briton Says Prisoners Routinely Tortured in Burma</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRUNNSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Briton jailed for three months in
Burma said today that political prisoners he encountered were
routinely beaten, given electrical shocks and forced to undergo
other forms of torture.
   Paul Key, a 45-year old physicist from London, was arrested
after crossing into western Burma from Bangladesh on Feb. 8. He was
found guilty of entering the country without a visa and violating
foreign exchange regulations.
   Key was deported from Burma to Thailand on May 4.
   Key said that although he was well treated, he witnessed daily
beatings of other prisoners and saw firsthand evidence of torture.
   At a detention center in the town of Maungdaw near the
Bangladesh border where he was held for a month, Key said he saw
one prisoner in a state of acute shock after interrogation by
military intelligence personnel. The 20-year-old man had what
appeared to be electrode burn marks on his back and said he was
given shocks to his head and body, Key said.
   ``All the prisoners considered torture so routine that they
found it amusing when I told them that it was not normal elsewhere
in the world,'' Key told The Associated Press in an interview in
Bangkok.
   ``It was taken for granted that they wire you up when you walk
through the door,'' he said.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, in a
May 2 report said torture of civilians in Burma was widespread and
anyone suspected of opposing the government was at risk. The U.S.
Embassy in Rangoon, the Burmese capital, has said some people have
died as a result of torture.
   The military government has routinely denied all torture reports
by Amnesty International and other groups since it took power in
September 1988.
   Key said prisoners who were members of insurgent groups received
the harshest treatment, and Moslem prisoners were the most frequent
victims of maltreatment by Burmese prison trustees and guards.
   A farmer in his 30s said he and two other Moslem Arakanese
insurgents had received electric shocks to their backs, heads and
genitals, and been beaten on their knees by guards, Key said.
   Another prisoner told Key that a plastic sheet had been wrapped
around his face and his head was ducked under water so he would
slowly suffocate.
   Other prisoners described being bound and having water dripped
slowly on their heads, apparently to make them think they were
going insane, Key said.
   ``None of these people appeared to be of any significance except
that they were members of an insurgent group,'' Key said.
   He said that during his own interrogation he was asked if he had
any connection with Burmese politics and whether he knew Michael
Aris, the British husband of Burma's main opposition figure Aung
San Suu Kyi. Ms. Suu Kyi, who heads the National League for
Democracy, was placed under house arrest by the military government
in July.
   Key said he was transferred to a jail in the town of Sitwe in
Arakan state on April 9, where he encountered dozens of prisoners
held for taking part in the 1988 pro-democracy uprising.
   The movement was crushed after the army killed thousands of
people, and Western diplomats in Rangoon estimate the military has
detained several thousand dissidents since then.
   Also today, a Burmese government spokesman said it has rejected
U.S. Rep. Stephen Solarz's request to observe the May 27 election
because of his ``notorious record for creating unrest'' in Burma.
   Solarz, D-N.Y., has strongly criticized the military government
and expressed doubts that the election will be free and fair.

<HEAD>Shelby Seeks Pentagon Probe of Naval Academy Incident</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Alabama senator wants a Pentagon
investigation into the resignation of a female U.S. Naval Academy
midshipman who was handcuffed to a men's room urinal and taunted by
male classmates.
   Sen. Richard Shelby, D-Ala., a member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, wrote Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Navy
Secretary Lawrence Garrett III on Thursday asking them to look into
Gwen Marie Dreyer's resignation.
   ``Those responsible for the sexual harassment were only given
demerits and a loss of leave time, while the victim has felt it
necessary to resign from the Navy,'' Shelby wrote.
   The academy superintendent, Rear Adm. Virgil L. Hill Jr., said
Wednesday he had asked the chairman of the academy's board of
visitors to form a special subcommittee to report back this summer
with ``an honest appraisal and a good set of recommendations.''
   Dreyer, of Encinitas, Calif., resigned from the Naval Academy
last month after she became dissatisfied with the investigation of
the Dec. 8 incident at the once all-male academy in Annapolis, Md.
   Hill described the incident as ``a good-natured exchange'' that
``got out of hand.'' He said it escalated from a snowball fight
that had taken place minutes before.
   Dreyer was pulled from her dormitory room and dragged to the
bathroom by male midshipmen. She was eventually freed from the
urinal after her roommates shoved their way into the crowd and
pleaded for the keys to the handcuffs.
   About 10 percent of the 3,000 midshipmen at the academy are
women.

<HEAD>Banks Accuse AT&amp;T Of Violating Regulations With Universal Card</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four major banks have accused American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph of violating federal telephone and banking
regulations with its new Visa and MasterCard credit cards.
   The banks, in a filing with the Federal Communications
Commission, said Thursday that by offering 10 percent long-distance
discounts to holders of its AT&amp;T Universal Card, the telephone
giant was illegally discriminating against other AT&amp;T customers.
   The FCC filing cited published reports estimating that AT&amp;T
could have 5 million customers for its credit card by the end of
this year, with a total portfolio estimated at $5 billion.
   The banks _ BankAmerica Corp., Chase Manhattan Corp., Citicorp.
and MBNA America Bank _ also made filings with the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve, said Doug Jones, the
FDIC's deputy general counsel.
   Peter Gallagher, senior vice president for corporate and
consumer affairs at AT&amp;T Universal Card Services Corp., said AT&amp;T
was not violating telephone rules because the card was being
offered through a bank.

<HEAD>D.C. Statehood Bill Introduced</HEAD>

   Sens. Edward Kennedy and Paul Simon have
introduced a bill to make the District of Columbia the 51st state,
beginning what Kennedy predicted would be ``a difficult uphill
struggle.''
   ``The measure we are introducing is not new, but it is
overdue,'' said Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat who backed two
previous statehood bills that died without votes being taken.
   ``No one doubts this will be a difficult uphill struggle, but we
are committed to the effort,'' he said.
   Jesse Jackson, an ardent advocate of statehood, joined Kennedy
and Simon, an Illinois Democrat, at a news conference Thursday
announcing the bill.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Germans who once joyously embraced at the
broken Berlin Wall are now checking to see if they still have their
wallets.
   The wistful dream of creating a greater Germany has been
overshadowed by grim estimates of the costs, both human and
economic, of merging a strong economy and a desperately weak one.
   In the past eight days, East German teachers, train workers,
farmers and textile workers have held sporadic strikes to demand
job protection as the nations are unified.
   The strikes were the latest in a growing tide of labor unrest in
the country, where many people want free market wealth but are
worried about giving up socialist subsidies.
   Meanwhile, West Germans who once invited their Eastern neighbors
into their homes are now upset by the appetite of their dinner
guests.
   Voters in two West German states last weekend dealt West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl a stunning setback that was seen as a
mini-referendum on unification.
   Not only did his governing coalition lose both states, it lost
control of the upper house of Parliament, which must ratify some of
the laws that will be passed for unification.
   The opposition Social Democrats, who favor a slower pace of
unification, won both states and control of the upper house.
   West Germans fear higher taxes, deflated buying power and rising
interest rates as the cost for bailing out the ailing East German
economy and converting it to a free market.
   East Germans fear widespread unemployment, Western-style prices
for basic necessities and second-class citizenship in a united
Germany.
   With this backdrop, West Germany and East Germany today signed a
treaty billed as a blueprint for economic and social unification
that is to take place July 2.
   The centerpiece is the circulation of the West German mark as
the official East German currency.
   East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere secured a major
victory by getting Bonn to agree to a 1-1 conversion for wages,
pensions and small savings accounts of East Germans.
   But East Germans still will make only about one-third of the
salaries of West Germans.
   Economists also estimate that 500,000 to 2 million workers will
lose their jobs as East German factories, now run by the state, are
forced to deal with operating losses and foreign competition.
   The treaty intentionally leaves vague many of the key aspects of
unification, including how property and factories that now are all
state-owned will be converted to the public sector.
   Some East Germans fear West German investors will buy up the
nation after July 2.
   Kohl wants Western investors to have an incentive for investing
in East Germany's moribund industrial sector, while de Maiziere
wants some limits on how much property West Germans can own.
   Kohl would like to speed the unification process before his
popularity, at its peak just a few months ago, erodes any further.
   The left-leaning Social Democrats in West Germany want to slow
it, hoping that the inevitable pain of converting a socialist
system to a capitalist economy will increase their chances in the
Dec. 2 West German elections.
   De Maiziere, like Kohl, would like to see unification come
quickly and has been at odds with East Germany's Social Democrats,
who are part of his governing coalition.
   But de Maiziere also has pressed the West Germans for more than
they are willing to give _ perhaps not enough to completely satisfy
the Social Democrats, but enough to drag out the talks.
   In the meantime, the term ``German unification'' is increasingly
mentioned in the context of German disunity.
   ``We are one people,'' was the slogan for the unification
movement that followed last year's revolt against Communism.
   ``We are one stupid people,'' read a sign at a labor rally two
weeks ago near the Berlin Wall.
   While the next decade may produce a nation that is one big,
happy community of good wages and high living standards, Germans on
both sides of the border are focusing more now on the pain they may
have to endure to reach the end of the rainbow.

<TEXT>
   Women can't be banned from jobs that could
harm a fetus, the state's highest court ruled, upholding a
challenge to a company policy that affected even women who have no
plans to have children.
   The state Supreme Court on Thursday let stand a lower court
ruling that a battery company's fetal protection policy, keeping
fertile women away from jobs that could expose them to low levels
of lead, amounts to sex discrimination.
   The company, Johnson Controls Inc., also has a case pending
before the U.S. Supreme Court over the same policy.
   The California appellate desicion had called the policy
``blatant, overt gender-based discrimination'' based on
``unfounded, unscientific stereotypic notions about women.''
   ``We are in an era of choice. A woman is not required to become
a Victorian brood mare,'' said the 4th District Court of Appeal in
its 3-0 ruling Feb. 28 in a case from Fullerton.
   But in a case stemming from a Johnson Controls plant in
Minnesota, a federal appeals court had upheld the policy. The U.S.
Supreme Court is expected to rule on the issue by mid-1991.
   However that turns out, Thursday's action, involving state fair
employment law, should settle the issue for California, a state
lawyer said.
   ``California courts are competent to decide what's in the public
interest in California, without regard to what happens in federal
courts,'' said Deputy Attorney General Manuel Medeiros.
   Gerald Griffin, a lawyer for the company, said it was ``very
surprising'' that the state high court declined to consider the
appeal, especially since the U.S. Supreme Court is reviewing the
same issue.
   Johnson Controls argued that the appellate ruling gave short
shrift to an employer's ``legitimate interest in protecting the
health of unborn children.''
   But the appeals court said research has shown that exposure to
lead could affect male workers who become fathers, as well as women
who become mothers _ a finding disputed by the company. Johnson
Controls' policy excludes only women from production jobs.
   ``I think it has implications for all women who are trying to
get jobs in traditionally male-dominated industries,'' said
Catherine Ruckelshaus of San Francisco Legal Aid's Employment Law
Center.
   Federal and state work safety agencies ban workers, both male
and female, from job sites if their blood tests above certain
levels for lead. Johnson Controls' policy is based on lower
exposure levels.
   The suit was filed by a woman named Queen Elizabeth Foster, who
was denied a battery assembly job in Johnson Controls' Globe
Battery Co. plant in 1983, although she wasn't pregnant or planning
to have a baby.
   The company's policy, adopted three months earlier, denied all
battery production jobs to women of childbearing age who couldn't
prove they were infertile.

<TEXT>
   The two German nations today signed a
historic treaty that will make them a single economic entity in
less than seven weeks and introduce fragile East Germany to the
rigors of capitalism.
   The signing means that as of July 2, when the treaty takes
effect, the four-decade division of Germany will come to an end in
many ways.
   However, the thorny issue of the military status of a united
Germany remains to be resolved, especially the Soviet Union's
rejection of proposed NATO membership for the new Germany.
   Flanked by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East German
Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, the finance ministers of the two
merging nations signed the treaty inside the federal government's
opulent Palais Schaumburg.
   ``This is a historic hour in the life of the German nation,''
Kohl said during the ceremony.
   ``We have come here together to sign a treaty after 45 years of
painful division, a treaty with which we are completing the first
significant step toward the restoration of Germany's state unity.''
   ``What we are living through here is the birth of a free and
united Germany,'' Kohl said.
   De Maiziere said that not all ``flowery dreams'' of East Germans
will be fulfilled with the treaty. ``But no one will be worse off
than before.''
   ``Which other country gets such a good starting position as we
with this treaty?''
   The ceremony was loaded with symbolism.
   West German Finance Minister Theodor Waigel and his East German
counterpart, Walter Romberg, signed the treaty inside the former
office of Konrad Adenauer and at his writing desk.
   Adenauer was West Germany's first chancellor and helped guide
the nation from postwar ruin to the present affluence and its place
in the Western alliance. On one wall of the room is a tapestry of
Moses, who led his people across the desert.
   Kohl has made no secret that he would not mind having a place in
history next to the revered Adenauer _ as the architect of a
reunited Germany.
   The so-called state treaty between East and West Germany is the
crowning achievement so far of Kohl's fast-forward unification
efforts.
   The signing comes just two months after East Germany's first
free elections, and a little more than six months after the Berlin
Wall was opened by East Germany's pro-democracy revolution.
   Under provisions of the document, East Germany will get massive
assistance from West Germany in exchange for scrapping its moribund
centrally planned economy for capitalist principles.
   The East German government has opted for annexation of its
economy by West Germany rather than face possible economic collapse.
   Nonetheless, there are widespread concerns in East Germany the
changes could trigger enormous problems, such as massive
unemployment from the close of factories unable to keep up in a
competitive economic system.
   West Germans are also worried about the effects of economic
merger, fearful they will have to bear awesome costs to rescue
their East German cousins.
   Under the treaty, West Germany's mighty deutsche mark will
become East Germany's legal tender. All monetary affairs will be
controlled by West Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank.
   East Germany will be required to start selling off state-owned
property under the treaty to help cover reconstruction costs.
   On Wednesday, West Germany unveiled a $70 billion German Unity
Fund to be used in the East German reconstruction effort. Costs of
the fund will be covered by borrowing and savings in West Germany's
federal budget.

<HEAD>British Engineer Found Dead in Iraq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British engineer in Iraq to fix machinery
at a government plant was found dead in his hotel room, the state
Iraqi news agency said today. The cause of death was not known.
   The man, identified as J. Gordon Glass, was discovered Wednesday
in his Novotel Hotel room, the agency said. He was an employee of
Graham Johnson Machinery of Coventry, England, and had been in Iraq
since May 2.
   The British Embassy asked a British doctor working in Iraq to
join the Iraqi medical team investigating the death, the agency
said.
   The embassy said it would make no immediate comment.
   The news agency had no details about Glass' age or family.
   It said he was in Baghdad to work on machinery for an Iraqi
plant belonging to the Ministry of Industry and Military
Industrialization, Iraq's prime weapons developer.
   The agency did not identify the nature of the plant or the kind
of machinery under repair. Glass was accompanied by two other
British engineers, the news agency said.
   There are as many as 3,000 British engineers and businessmen
living in Iraq.
   Relations between Iraq and Britain have soured over the past two
months.
   On March 15, Iraq hanged Farzod Bazoft, a London-based, Iranian
born correspondent for the Observer Weekly, on espionage charges.
The British ambassador, withdrawn in protest, returned to his post
Thursday.
   Relations further deteriorated after Britain stopped two
shipments it said were destined for Iraq's arms industry. Britain
said one shipment could be used to build an enormous artillery gun,
and the other, a trigger for a nuclear device.
   Iraq denied the charges, saying the alleged ``super gun'' was
actually parts for a petrochemical plant and the ``trigger,''
equipment for university research.

<TEXT>
   An international conference on
Indochinese refugees ended today with the United States rejecting a
call to set up a refugee center for Vietnamese boat people on U.S.
soil, delegates said.
   Delegates at the conference of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees committee on Indochinese refugees had urged nations that
oppose the forced repatriation of Vietnamese boat people _ such as
the United States _ to set up refugee centers of their own.
   The so-called countries of temporary refuge, where boat people
land first, also urged Vietnam to take effective measures to
prevent its people from leaving their homeland illegally.
   Philippines delegate Herman Laurel told reporters today that
Southeast Asian nations and Hong Kong will jointly protest to the
United States and Vietnam over their refugee policies.
   ``All embassies and missions of these first asylum countries
will be marching to the capital of these two countries and present
a written statement expressing their concern,'' Laurel said
following the conference.
   The British government announced Wednesday it had suggested that
the United States take 9,000 Vietnamese boat people from Hong Kong
and house them in a special camp, possibly on the American island
of Guam.
   The U.S. delegate, Allan Jury, told reporters he was not
authorized to agree to such a change in U.S. refugee policy. He
reiterated U.S. opposition to forced repatriation.
   ``It is a belief held at the highest level of our government and
it will have to be addressed at the highest level of our
government,'' Jury said after the conference. ``I do believe that
it will be decided on that level how they wish to proceed.''
   Sergio Vieira de Mello, the conference chairman, said he hoped a
meeting in Geneva later this year will resolve issues raised in the
Manila meeting.
   He pointed to a decline in the number of asylum seekers,
particularly from Vietnam, as more people use the orderly departure
program, which allows them to leave legally. But de Mello raised
concern the number of refugees being turned back by first-asylum
countries.
   The 10 Asian countries participating were: Thailand, Malaysia,
China, Brunei, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Philippines, Vietnam
and Indonesia.
   Others included United States, Britain, Soviet Union, Australia,
Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, West Germany,
Vatican, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden,
Switzerland.

   The days of wine, womanizing and wickedness
on the nighttime soap ``Falcon Crest'' have come to an end.
   Thursday marked the last episode of the long running CBS series
set in a fictional California vineyard.
   The decision to cancel comes as networks revamp schedules to
prepare for next week, when programming announcements begin for the
fall season.
   The soap starred veteran actress Jane Wyman as the manipulative
and powerful Angela Channing, who runs the Falcon Crest winery and
everybody else within a five-mile radius.
   Once a highly rated show, ``Falcon Crest'' has plummeted in the
weekly A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings. When it debuted in 1981, the
program followed ``Dallas'' and cashed in on the soap opera craze
sweeping nighttime television.
   Compared with ``Dynasty'' and ``Dallas,'' however, the plot
lines of ``Falcon Crest'' were more violent and crime-ridden, with
murders, bombings and plane crashes.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of demonstrators
clashed with police today, and thousands of other people prayed and
wept before altars in memory of the victims of the worst rebellion
in modern South Korean history.
   Ten years ago today, a widespread civilian uprising for
democracy began in this southern provincial city. By the time
military forces quelled it 10 days later, at least 200 civilians
had been killed.
   In today's protests, police reported many arrests and injuries
but gave no nationwide figures. One report said that in Seoul alone
about 500 people were arrested in a preventive police strike.
   Nationwide, 70,000 police were deployed to prevent violence,
officials said. In Seoul, 12,000 riot police were posted around
government offices, public buildings and foreign legations, they
said.
   In Kwangju, 150 miles south of Seoul, 100,000 people held a
nighttime rally in the city center and shouted for the ouster of
President Roh Tae-woo. Organizers claimed 200,000 people turned out
but police said only 50,000 did.
   ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!'' the crowd shouted, waving blue, red,
yellow banners in an intermittent rain. ``Yankee go home!''
protesters also screamed.
   Radical leaders shouted over loudspeakers that the souls of the
Kwangju victims can never rest in peace until Roh is overthrown.
Roh was one of several army generals in control of the martial law
government that crushed the 1980 revolt militarily.
   The speakers also demanded an end to the U.S. military presence
in South Korea, claiming that Washington condoned the crushing of
the Kwangju uprising by Korean military forces. About 43,000 U.S.
troops are stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty.
   After the three-hour rally, protesters marched through downtown
streets, waving banners and shouting slogans. Protesters in groups
ranging from 500 to 2,000 people clashed with police in various
parts of Kwangju.
   In several encounters, police were outnumbered by swarms of
protesters hurling hundreds of firebombs at a time. Some police
were overpowered by demonstrators and beaten. Many onlookers on the
sidewalks cheered protesters and booed riot police marching with
shields in front of them.
   In Seoul, 2,000 students hurling rocks and firebombs fought riot
police in scattered street battles, demanding the disbandment of
Roh's new ruling Democratic Liberal Party organized in a
three-party merger early this year.
   About 300 students burned the flags of the United States and
Roh's governing Democratic Liberal Party and fought police in front
of Hanyang University. Police responded with tear gas.
   At a hillside graveyard on the edge of Kwangju, thousands of
people, including families and friends of the victims, attended a
memorial ceremony during a steady downpour.
   ``My child! my child!'' cried an old woman in white mourning
clothes, rubbing a gray tombstone bearing the name of her slain
17-year-old daughter.
   A few yards away, 20 youths put down a bundle of yellow flowers
in front of a tomb and made deep bows. They sang anti-government
songs and shouted, ``Remember Kwangju!'' and ``Fight for
democracy!''
   Down the hill, weeping mourners treaded their way to the
graveyard along muddy fields holding umbrellas.
   Organizers of the memorial service said 50,000 people visited
the cemetery, named today by dissidents as ``a democratic
sanctuary.''
   The tragedy in Kwangju, a city of 1 million, began May 18, 1980
when hundreds of thousands of citizens rose up against the central
government to protest a crackdown on political dissent. The
protesters drove out police and took control of the city for 10
days before being crushed by tank-led troops. By official count,
200 people were killed and more than 1,700 injured or wounded.
Dissidents claim the death toll was much higher.
   Many Kwangju citizens believe Washington condoned the harsh
military attack on the pro-democracy revolt. The United States has
denied the accusation.

   Physicians are pleased with the progress of
freed hostage Robert Polhill, whose cancerous vocal cords were
surgically removed, a spokesman for Walter Reed Army Medical Center
said today.
   Polhill was resting in an intensive care unit at the medical
center the day after a four-hour operation characterized by
surgeons as successful. His next challenge is learning to speak
with no voice box.
   ``His condition is listed as good,'' said Jim Stueve, a
spokesman for Walter Reed. ``We will continue to monitor him
closely because of his diabetes. Physicians are generally pleased
with his progress.''
   Stueve said it was not known how long Polhill would remain in
intensive care.
   Polhill's wife, Ferial, and mother, Ruth, waited at the hospital
during the operation and were with him afterward, said another
spokesman, Ben Smith.
   The former hostage, who was released by Shiite Moslems
kidnappers last month after 39 months in captivity in Lebanon, was
expected to remain in intensive care for some time because he is
diabetic, the spokesman said.
   Doctors were expected to provide an update on Polhill's
condition today.
   Polhill, 55, could speak barely above a whisper when he arrived
in the United States on April 27, a warning sign of larynx cancer.
   The business and accounting professor had lost 25 pounds while
in captivity. Physicians waited until last week to perform a biopsy
so that he could regain the weight and strength needed for general
anesthesia.
   The tumor probably had been growing at least a year when it was
diagnosed, Col. Russ Zajtchuk, deputy commander of clinical
services at the Army hospital, said in disclosing Polhill's cancer
Wednesday. If caught earlier, it possibly could have been treated
with radiation alone, he said.
   Instead, the growth was ``extensive,'' involving both vocal
cords and other parts of the larynx and necessitating radical
surgery, Zajtchuk said. There was no evidence it had spread to the
lymph nodes, he said.
   Larynx cancer is related to smoking, and Polhill was a cigarette
smoker who continued the habit while in captivity, Zajtchuk said.
   ``Smokers are by far the highest risk group,'' and male victims
outnumber females by a ratio of almost 5 to 1, said a leading
specialist on larynx cancer, Dr. Allan Abramson, chairman of the
Otolaryngology Department at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center
in New York.
   Abramson said Polhill would awaken from surgery to find himself
unable to talk, with a permanent breathing hole in his throat
called a stoma.
   Polhill must still undergo radiation therapy and will have to
learn how to communicate without a voice box, Zajtchuk said.
   Abramson said there are three options for laryngectomy patients:
   _An electronic device the patient puts against his neck to
transform the movement inside into a metallic-sounding voice.
   _Esophageal speech, involving use of air pushed up from the
stomach to vibrate in a way that produces a gutteral-sounding
speech.
   _Surgery to insert a breathing valve in the throat, against
which air vibrates and produces a sound similar to the human voice.
   Zajtchuk said Polhill had begun working with a speech therapist
to discuss what he will do after treatment.

   Emperor Akihito today became the first
Japanese monarch to pay tribute at a monument to the 70,000 people
who died in the atomic bomb blast that devastated Nagasaki 45 years
ago.
   A steady rain fell as Akihito, accompanied by Empress Michiko,
bowed deeply and placed a bouquet of white flowers on a dark
granite cenotaph before the monument.
   Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima led Akihito to the site. Motoshima was
shot in the chest in January by an ultrarightist for saying the
late Emperor Hirohito could have helped end World War II sooner and
spared Nagasaki.
   Japan surrendered six days after the Aug. 9, 1945 atomic bombing.
   Though Hirohito, now known in Japan as Emperor Showa, visited
Nagasaki for a sporting event in 1969, his son, Akihito, is the
first emperor to present flowers at the Peace Park memorial.
   As the emperor left the park, some of the 2,600 people who
attended sang ``Kimi Ga Yo,'' Japan's unofficial national anthem.
Shouts of ``Banzai,'' a wish for long life, rang out when his
20-car motorcade arrived.
   ``The emperor is from a new generation, my generation,'' said
Sachiko Nagata, a store clerk who was seven years old when the bomb
fell. ``I think he has helped heal some of the wounds of the war by
coming here.''
   Police mobilized 4,000 officers to provide security for the
emperor and empress during their four-day visit to the city on the
southern island of Kyushu.
   The Roman Catholic mayor drew the ire of rightist groups with
his remarks about Hirohito. Before being shot, Motoshima received
countless death threats and lost his membership in the governing
Liberal Democratic Party.
   Japanese rightists represent a small minority but maintain a
high profile, dressing in military garb and driving through cities
in convoys of armored, painted trucks blaring march music. They are
staunchly nationalist.
   They also revere the monarchy and chastise those they believe
oppose it.

<HEAD>Stock Sale: `Everybody That Ever Was Or Ever Wanted To Be A Cowboy
Is There'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM LACEKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MILES CITY, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's biggest sale of bucking
horses for rodeos began its annual hurrah today, the excuse for a
three-day cowboy Mardi Gras that brings thousands of cowpokes into
this High Plains cowtown.
   ``Everybody that ever was a cowboy or ever wanted to be a cowboy
is there,'' said Don Jacobs, a Great Falls, Mont., rodeo stock
contractor who has attended every sale since it started in 1950.
   Advance ticket sales for the event, modestly titled the World
Famous Miles City Bucking Horse Sale, topped 15,000 by last week,
said Susan Sanderson, secretary for the sale's board of governors.
   As always, all 400 motel rooms in Miles City have been reserved
for months. Motels in towns up to 80 miles take up part of the
overflow; private homes, trailer parks and campgrounds absorb the
rest.
   ``Miles City has about 10,000 people, and the population doubles
over the weekend,'' Sanderson said.
   Local merchants, especially the two Western-wear stores, are
delighted. But, Sanderson said, ``I would say the bars benefit more
than anybody.''
   The sale draws more than just cowboys. ``We get a lot of college
kids,'' Sanderson said. ``We do get a lot of older people, though.
It's a very nice mix of people.''
   And it's not as rowdy as might be expected. Arrests hit a record
low last year: 22, all for misdemeanor charges.
   ``Previous to '64 it used to be just a bucking horse sale. They
didn't have that much that went with it,'' said Wes Tibbets, who
runs the sale at the Miles City Livestock Center on the Custer
County Fairgrounds.
   Now, the weekend includes parimutuel horse racing, a parade,
street dances, a gun and coin show, a barbecue, an ice cream social
and a trade exposition.
   Most of all, there is cowboy talk.
   The sale started in 1950 out of simple necessity, Tibbets
recalled.
   ``The guy who owned and operated the livestock auction got into
a trade and ended up with a bunch of horses,'' he said. ``He put on
a bucking horse sale, and it was fairly successful.
   ``Back in the '50s and even the early '60s, when there used to
be a lot more horses in the country, there used to be 500, 600,
even 700 horses that would go through the sale.''
   The counts have dwindled in recent years, sliding from 431 in
1983 to 220 last year. Tibbets estimated this year's sale would see
250 to 300 horses strut their stuff for 10 to 15 rodeo stock
contractors from around the country.
   Most will sell for a few hundred dollars, but some may go much
higher. Neil Gay of Mesquite, Texas, set a new record last year
when he paid $6,750 for a rodeo-wise mare named Shotgun.

   Police today killed one of three
private security guards who held their employer's family hostage
for 12 hours over demands for a $22,000 ransom, police said.
   Police said Reynante Flores was killed after he tried to escape
lawmen who went to rescue the wealthy family of Dr. Jose Raymundo,
taken hostage by the group late Thursday. The family members
eventually were rescued unharmed.
   Flores' two accomplices left the house with the doctor's wife
and a daughter to cash a check in the bank, police said.
   The officer, who refused to be identified, said the rest of the
hostages were left with Flores but one maid managed to slip out and
report the incident to authorities.
   When police demanded his surrender, Flores, with two of the
Raymundo children, drove out of the house in the doctor's family
car. A chase ensued and Flores was killed during a shootout, police
said.
   His two companions who managed to cash the check escaped and
later abandoned the doctor's wife and a daughter in Tarlac
province, 70 miles north of Manila. They remained at large.

<HEAD>Family Says Henson's Death Nobody's Fault</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Puppeteer Jim Henson talked to his cousin,
a doctor, but seemed to have only a cold and did not have an actual
medical exam during a visit to North Carolina the weekend before he
died, his mother says.
   The 53-year-old Henson, the creator of the Muppets, died of
complications from pneumonia in New York on Wednesday, three days
after returning from a Mother's Day trip to Ahoskie. A memorial
service was set for Monday. Henson had requested that no one wear
black.
   Dr. David M. Gelmont, director of intensive care at New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in New York, had said that Henson
saw a doctor over the weekend in North Carolina but there was no
sign of pneumonia.
   The doctor was Henson's cousin. But Henson's mother, Barbara
Henson, said Thursday that the cousin did not examine her son. She
declined to give his name.
   ``Jim saw his cousin in the car, if you call that seeing a
doctor,'' Mrs. Henson said.
   ``He does not treat our family,'' she said. ``He did not examine
Jim. He merely picked him up at a motel and brought him to my house
for lunch.''
   She said the media ``are trying to make a problem, and there
isn't one.''
   Gelmont agreed that any implication that someone in North
Carolina failed to treat Henson properly is wrong. In North
Carolina, Gelmont said, Henson's only symptom was a mild cough.
   ``No yokel doctor did anything wrong down there,'' Gelmont said.
   When Henson arrived Saturday, his family thought he had a cold.
   ``He was a little sniffly,'' his mother told The Charlotte
Observer. ``It was a nice day. We just played croquet.''
   Because he felt worse Sunday, she said, he slept late at his
motel, didn't eat anything for lunch, and decided to take an
earlier flight home. She said the cousin advised him to see a
physician once he got back to New York.
   Streptococcus pneumonia group A _ the form of bacterial
pneumonia that attacked Henson's lungs and other organs _ spreads
unusually fast. It wasn't until Monday, Gelmont said, that Henson
noticed blood in his phlegm. By 5 a.m. Tuesday, when he arrived at
the emergency room, he had trouble breathing.
   Lisa Simon, who produces ``Sesame Street,'' said no decision has
been made whether Henson's death would be explained to children who
watch the show, or what would become of the characters for whom
Henson did the voices, including Kermit the frog and Ernie.
   ``We're just dealing with shock of Jim's death,'' Ms. Simon said.
   The show won't resume production until September for the 22nd
season, which begins airing in January 1991.
   The time from now until September ``gives us the opportunity to
catch our breath and see where we're going to go from here,'' said
Simon. ``There are a lot of characters on the show other than Jim's
characters.''
   Will Lee, an actor who played kindly shopkeeper Mr. Hooper on
the program, died in December 1982 at the age of 74. Nearly a year
later, young viewers were told about Mr. Hooper's death. They got
the news on the Thanksgiving program, chosen because parents were
likely to be with their children then to answer questions.
   A memorial service was scheduled for noon Monday at the
Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan, said Susan Berry, a
spokeswoman for Jim Henson Productions.

   A twin-engine commuter plane spun out
of control after takeoff and crashed into a house near Manila
airport today, killing all 21 people aboard and a family of four on
the ground, authorities said.
   Investigators said initial findings showed that the right engine
of the Beechcraft King aircraft failed, and that the plane never
gained more than 400 feet altitude before plunging into the bedroom
of the house in the middle-class Manila suburb of Paranaque, about
a half a mile south of the airport.
   The dead included a Japanese man, his Filipino wife, and their
two daughters, who were asleep in their bedroom at the time of the
crash, witnesses and officials said.
   The crash occurred one week after a Philippine Airlines Boeing
737 with 119 people aboard exploded and caught fire while waiting
to take off from the domestic airport on a flight to the central
Philippine city of Iloilo. Eight people were killed but the cause
of the incident has not been determined.
   The propeller-driven aircraft, owned by the Aerolift Corp., took
off about 6:25 a.m. today for Surigao, 450 miles south of Manila,
officials said. Moments later, the pilot radioed he was returning
to the Manila domestic airport.
   ``When I noticed he could not gain altitude, I immediately
advised the fire station,'' said air controller Francisco Reyes.
``I said, `Get out there immediately because the plane is going to
crash.'''
   Following the crash, Transport Secretary Oscar Orbos ordered
Aerolift's five aircraft grounded until they can be checked.
   Aerolift spokesman Benjie Torres said the plane carried 19
passengers and two crew members. Passengers included Gloria
Rescurrection, mayor of the town of Pilar in Surigao del Norte
province.
   Witnesses said the aircraft lost altitude, spun wildly and
nose-dived into the home of Yasukazu Suzuki, 47, originally of
Yokohama, Japan. The plane exploded in flames.
   Paranaque residents began moving clothes and other belongings
outside their homes for fear the fire would spread, but it was
contained. Witnesses said debris and parts of charred bodies were
scattered in the area. Within hours, rescuers recovered the
family's bodies and those of the 21 aboard the plane.
   Marilyn Molobuco, 19, a maid at the Japanese home, said she
heard a loud explosion and rushed to her employers' bedroom to
awaken them.
   ``I did not know that a plane crashed,'' she said. ``I tried to
wake up my employers but when I saw that fire was coming out from
under the door, I ran.''
   Arlene Rebong, a neighbor, said she was having breakfast nearby
when she noticed an aircraft flying very low. ``From the way it
sounded, there seemed to be something wrong,'' she said. ``In a
split second it crashed. There was a loud explosion and a ball of
fire.''
   Raymond Lebunao, 14, who worked in the house as an errand boy,
said the plane slammed into the couple's bedroom, where they were
sleeping with their children. ``I was inside the house,'' he said.
``I saw the plane coming down. I ran. It was spinning out of
control, then it crashed and burst into flames.''

   A French high-speed train today broke its own world
speed record for the third time in two weeks, hitting 320.2 mph.
   The speed reached by the ``train a grande Vitesse'' _ or TGV _
betters a mark of 317.4 mph set Wednesday.
   The sprint today concludes two weeks of time trials held in
western France by the national railroad, the Societe Nationale des
Chemins de Fer.
   West German and Japanese manufacturers are competing with France
for high-speed train contracts in Europe, North America, South
Korea and Australia.
   The blue-and-silver bullet-nosed TGV established a milestone May
9 by breaking the 300 mph barrier, rocketing along at 317.3 mph.
   The normal speed for the trains is about 185 mph along a
specially constructed track. The trains are carrying no passengers
during the time trials.

   A circuit judge acted illegally when he
placed restrictions on reporters covering a juvenile trial stemming
from an alleged rape at the South Dakota governor's mansion, the
state Supreme Court ruled.
   In a unanimous decision Thursday, the high court said Circuit
Judge Marshall Young of Rapid City must rescind his order. Young
had threatened reporters with arrest if they published the names of
people involved in the March trial of two juveniles.
   Gov. George Mickelson has acknowledged that his son, David, was
one of the two.
   Young's order was illegal because he failed to hold a hearing
before issuing it, made it too broad and required law enforcement
officers to enforce possible violations of the order, the Supreme
Court said.
   However, the justices declined to rule on the constitutionality
of the state law on which the circuit judge's order was based.
   The Sioux Falls Argus Leader and The Associated Press had argued
that the law, which prohibits the publication of names of people
involved in juvenile court proceedings, was an unconstitutional
prior restraint on the news media's right to publish lawfully
obtained information.
   Young presided over a closed-door trial of two 17-year-old boys
charged with sex offenses in connection with a Nov. 28 incident at
the governor's mansion. After the two-day trial, the judge
acquitted one boy of non-forcible rape and acquitted the other of
aiding and abetting rape.
   The two boys and a third 17-year-old admitted to charges of
underage drinking and were given probation and ordered to do
community work. Young also ordered that the two boys who had been
charged with sex offenses must each pay one-half the medical
expenses of the alleged rape victim, a 16-year-old girl.

   A 74-year-old Japanese paper magnate owns the
world's two most expensive paintings after landing Pierre Auguste
Renoir's shimmering ``Au Moulin de la Galette'' for $78.1 million.
   The Renoir was sold Thursday at Sotheby's to Ryoei Saito, who on
Tuesday paid $82.5 million at Christie's for Vincent van Gogh's
melancholy ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet.''
   Saito is the chairman emeritus of Japan's second-largest paper
company, the Daishowa Paper Manufacturing Corp.
   Saito told The Associated Press in a telephone interview today
that he had not expected to win the auctions.
   ``They are world-class, wonderful works,'' he said.
   After the van Gogh purchase, Saito had told the Yomiuri Shimbun
newspaper: ``It cost 5 billion yen (33 million dollars) more than I
expected, but that's nothing. Next I want the Renoir.''
   The bidding for the Renoir started at $25 million and went up in
increments of $1 million. Applause broke out as the winning bid,
received by telephone, was announced.
   Auctioneer John Marion called the final price ``marvelous.''
   The large Impressionist canvas, framed by green and yellow
trees, depicts a sunny garden in Montmartre filled with dancing
couples, the men in black frocks and yellow hats and the women in
pink and blue gowns.
   Art historian John Rewald described the 1876 painting as ``the
finest work Renoir painted.''
   Renoir painted two versions of ``Au Moulin de la Galette'' in
1876. The one offered for sale at Sotheby's was the property of
Betsey Cushing Whitney, the widow of John Hay Whitney, the
financier, publisher and former ambassador to Britain. A larger
version hangs in the Musee d'Orsay in Paris.
   The final price eclipsed the pre-sale estimate of $40 million to
$50 million.
   The Renoir was the highlight of a sale of 70 Impressionist and
modern paintings and sculptures at Sotheby's.
   Seventeen of the 70 lots sold for less than the pre-sale
estimate and 12 were not sold because they failed to reach a
minimum sale price set confidentially by the seller.
   The total for the night still was $286 million, which Marion
described as ``a record sale in any way that you want to count it.''
   Marion rejected reports that the high prices paid for paintings
in recent years may be softening. ``It is a very solid market,'' he
said.
   Milton Esterow, editor and publisher of ARTnews, disagreed.
   ``When you have a tremendous painting, like the van Gogh or the
Renoir ... you're going to get extraordinary prices,'' Esterow said.
   Otherwise, he said, ``the market is correcting to a more
realistic level'' after the frenzied buying of the past few years.
   At the Christie's sale where the van Gogh was sold, 24 of the 81
offerings went unsold.
   Before Thursday's auction, the highest price paid for a Renoir
was $17.7 million in April 1989 for ``La Promenade''; it was bought
by the J. Paul Getty Museum.
   But art experts said no Renoir of the caliber of ``Au Moulin de
la Galette'' has been on the auction block.
   Six of the 12 most expensive paintings sold at auction have been
bought by Japanese bidders, who are especially interested in the
Impressionists.
   Other important works sold Thursday at Sotheby's were three
paintings from the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Wassily
Kandinsky's ``Fugue'' sold for $20.0 million, Amedeo Modigliani's
``Boy with a Blue Shirt'' sold for $11.55 million and Marc
Chagall's ``Anniversaire'' sold for $14.85 million.
   The Kandinsky and Chagall set records for works sold at auction
by those artists.
   The paintings were sold at Sotheby's Upper East Side galleries
in front of a standing-room-only crowd of art dealers and
socialites. Buyers in the room raised paddles to make bids, while
bids from buyers elsewhere came in on a bank of telephones at the
front of the room.
   All prices include a 10 percent commission that goes to the
auction house.

<HEAD>Nelson Mandela Says It's Too Soon to Lift Sanctions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL GOLDSMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela said today that any
government that wants to lift sanctions against South Africa now
either supports apartheid or ``is totally ignorant.''
   The African National Congress leader said that although progress
is being made toward winning black rights, it is too early to ease
international pressure on the South African government.
   Mandela spoke at a news conference as he ended a three-day visit
to Algeria before going on to Libya. The black nationalist leader
said he would urge European leaders next month not to lift
sanctions because apartheid is still in place despite the reform
initiatives of President F.W. de Klerk.
   In an apparent reference to the policies of British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's policies, Mandela said: ``Any country
that argues the time has come to lift sanctions is totally ignorant
of what is going on in South Africa, or is a supporter of
apartheid.''
   Mandela, freed in February after 27 years in prison, declined to
answer when asked whether he would meet Mrs. Thatcher on his
upcoming European tour. Mrs. Thatcher has opposed most sanctions
against South Africa, arguing they would hurt the country's black
majority more than the white minority.
   Mandela said de Klerk's government is trying to take advantage
of conflict among South African blacks in order to ``eliminate
members of those organizations whom the authorities regard as a
threat.''
   But he said the ANC is prepared in forthcoming talks with the
government to compromise on all matters except the principle of one
person, one vote.
   ``We are prepared to address the fears of whites that this
principle will bring one-sided rule,'' said Mandela. ``We are
prepared to guarantee the basic rights of all people, black and
white.''
   ``No one goes to a negotiating table if he is not prepared to
compromise,'' he added. ``We are prepared to meet the government's
wishes in a compromise which is in the interest of the population
of the country as a whole.''
   Mandela had a long meeting Thursday with President Chadli
Bendjedid during which he thanked the Algerian leader for support
during his imprisonment. Mandela was due to meet Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi in Tripoli, then go to Cairo to meet Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today the
Kremlin is prepared to examine any possibility to resolve the
dispute over Lithuania's independence, provided the Soviet
constitutional process is observed.
   The prime minister of the Baltic republic, Kazimiera Prunskiene,
met with Gorbachev on Thursday and later said significant progress
was made toward settling the dispute but their main difference
remained unresolved.
   Mrs. Prunskiene met this afternoon with Secretary of State James
A. Baker III, who has said the Baltic impasse was casting a shadow
over the summit to be held later this month in Washington between
Gorbachev and President Bush.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said later she was convinced that Baker supports
Lithuania's independence drive. Baker said he hoped the discussion
between Gorbachev and Mrs. Prunskiene would lead to full
negotiations.
   Tension was reported in Lithuania, however, as soldiers shot a
youth trying to enter a military compound and military helicopters
dropped leaflets saying, ``Down with the Government of Separatists!
Long Live Soviet Lithuania.''
   Supporters of independence gathered around the Lithuanian
parliament building to block any attempt by pro-Soviet forces to
occupy it, as occurred in the secessionist republic of Estonia on
Tuesday, said Eduardas Potashinskas, an editor at Lithuanian
television.
   Gorbachev has condemned the independence declarations of
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and until his meeting with Mrs.
Prunskiene on Thursday night, had refused to open talks with Baltic
leaders.
   Baker arrived at Spaso House, the home of U.S. Ambassador Jack
Matlock, an hour and 45 minutes late, indicating that his earlier
meeting with Gorbachev had gone into overtime.
   His meeting with Mrs. Prunskiene lasted for more than an hour,
twice as long as planned, and the prime minister told reporters she
told Baker about Lithuania's compromise plan and her talks with
Gorbachev.
   ``I became convinced again that the U.S.A. as well as other
governments support the restoration of independence and the path we
are taking,'' she said.
   Baker said, ``We had a full discussion on the situation with
respect to the Baltics, particularly Lithuania. We are very
hopeful, as we have been for some time, that a dialogue can begin.
It remains to be seen the degree to that which will be continued.''
   Gorbachev, speaking to reporters before meeting with Baker this
morning, said, ``through the constitutional process, we are ready
to consider any possibility, any question.''
   Mrs. Prunskiene, after meeting Gorbachev, said progress had been
made but that neither side suggested that the dispute had been
settled.
   The meeting late Thursday followed a Lithuanian offer to suspend
laws made following its declaration of independence March 11 if
negotiations could begin with the Kremlin to resolve the standoff.
   Gorbachev had not met with Lithuanian representatives in the
more than two months since the republic declared independence.
Instead, he applied economic pressure that includes a virtual
blockade of fuel, other raw materials and manufactured goods.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said the Lithuanian
proposal for a compromise was a sign that ``certain steps had been
made toward the normalization of the situation.''
   But it added: ``Prunskiene's attention was drawn to the
indispensible necessity that the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet cancel _
or at a minimum, suspend _ this act (the independence declaration)
and all the legislative measures following it that contradict the
Soviet Constitution.''
   Mrs. Prunskiene, speaking with reporters at the Lithuanian
mission in Moscow, said the republic's parliament will on Saturday
consider formalizing the offer to suspend implementation of the
declaration of independence.
   ``This does not mean we are returning to the situation of March
10,'' she told reporters, underlining the Lithuanian determination
not to back away from the declaration of independence.
   Longinas Vasiliauskas, press attache of the Lithuanian mission
in Moscow, said Mrs. Prunskiene called the meeting ``an
introduction to coming negotiations.''
   Mrs. Prunskiene declined to speculate on the exact terms that
the Lithuanian parliament would offer Moscow, but she said if the
Kremlin found them acceptable the two sides could name negotiating
teams to work out ``hundreds of concrete problems'' associated with
the declaration of independence.
   Earlier Thursday, Mrs. Prunskiene said Lithuania was willing to
make another major concession, agreeing to remain part of the
Soviet security system.
   Soviet authorities forcibly annexed Lithuania and its sister
republics of Estonia and Latvia in 1940, and the three have
declared independence this spring.

<HEAD>Mrs. Gallo Pleads `No Contest' to Manslaughter Charge, Gets
Probation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GILROY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge sentenced the wife of winemaker
Julio Gallo to probation for a fatal auto accident, saying he
thought the death would haunt 77-year-old Aileen Gallo for the rest
of her life.
   Mrs. Gallo received the sentence after pleading no contest
Thursday to a manslaughter charge in the Jan. 2 death of Sharon
Kauk, 26. Municipal Judge Jerome Brock said the plea was tantamount
to a guilty plea.
   Modesto-based Gallo, owned by Ernest and Julio Gallo, is the
world's largest winery, and the two brothers are each thought to be
worth $500 million.
   Mrs. Gallo was sentenced to three years' probation and 350 hours
of community service, fined $2,400 and ordered to make restitution
to the victim's family on all uninsured losses. She wept during her
court appearance.
   ``It was an emotional hearing,'' the judge said. ``All the
indications I have gotten throughout the case from the probation
report and her statement to probation officers and in court (is)
that the woman is pretty much devastated.''
   Brock said Mrs. Gallo apparently wasn't speeding or under the
influence of alcohol or drugs, but said she may have been
inattentive or used poor judgment on a dangerous highway. State
police had recommended the misdemeanor manslaughter charge, saying
there was no evidence of gross negligence.
   The judge said the family of the victim asked that Mrs. Gallo
not receive any jail time.
   Police said Mrs. Gallo was at the wheel when her car crossed
over the center line and collided with Mrs. Kauk's car. Mrs. Kauk's
husband and 2-year-old son were injured in the crash, as were Gallo
and Mrs. Gallo.

<HEAD>Energy Department to Release Health Records of Nuclear Plant
Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department said today it agreed to
make public the health and occupational records of 200,000 people
who have worked in the most dangerous plants in the government's
nuclear weapons production complex.
   The action, which had been anticipated for several months, marks
a turning point in a long battle over government efforts to keep
secret the data on which its own scientists have studied the health
effects of exposure to low levels of radiation.
   ``It's a historic development,'' said Daniel Berger, an attorney
for the Three Mile Island Public Health Fund, which sued the Energy
Department for release of the records in 1987. The fund was formed
to study the health effects of radiation after the 1979 accident at
the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.
   An agreement to settle the suit out of court was reached in late
March and took effect today, Berger said.
   ``It's a done deal,'' said M.J. Jamison, a department
spokeswoman. ``DOE is virtually giving up all the data they were
asked for,'' she said.
   The information was collected starting in 1965 by department
researchers at its installations at Oak Ridge, Tenn.; Richland,
Wash., and Los Alamos, N.M., Berger said.
   The data is at the center of an international scientific debate
about the effects on human health of chronic exposure to small
amounts of ionizing radiation.
   Under terms of the settlement, the department on June 18 is to
release the health and occupational records on 50,000 men and women
who worked at the Hanford nuclear weapons plant at Richland, which
made plutonium for the first atomic bombs.
   The records are to be released to Dr. Alice M. Stewart, a
British epidemiologist and the principal investigator for the Three
Mile Island Public Health Fund.
   By Aug. 18, the department is to release data on workers at the
Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Oak Ridge gaseous diffusion
plant and the Savannah River Site at Aiken, S.C., Berger said.
   Within six months, additional data is to be released for workers
at the Rocky Flats plutonium processing plant near Denver, Colo.,
the Mound Laboratory near Miamisburg, Ohio, the Pantex weapons
assembly plant near Amarillo, Texas, the Los Alamos weapons design
laboratory in New Mexico and a Los Alamos maintenance facility.
   In addition, data is to be released within one year for workers
at the Fernald, Ohio, uranium processing facility and the defunct
Mallinckrodt Chemical Works in St. Louis which purified uranium for
the first atomic bomb, Berger said.
   The 200,000 workers represent about one-third of all the people
who have worked at nuclear weapons plants since the 1942
organization of the Manhattan Project to develop and build the
first atomic bombs, dropped on Japan in 1945.
   The two sides have agreed that the department may withhold
individual identifications such as names and Social Security
numbers, Berger said. These identifications had been sought in the
original lawsuit, but he said the Three Mile Island group decided
to defer that issue in order to get the data quicker.
   The department announced last December that it intended to
settle the Three Mile Island suit and release the records,
following the recommendation of a special advisory panel appointed
by Energy Secretary James D. Watkins. The panel said release of the
records was important to restore credibility to the weapons program.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Orders Injunction Against Reuters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal court ordered Reuters to continue
exchanging photographs with United Press International until
lawsuits between the news agencies are resolved.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in issuing the injunction
Thursday, said UPI had shown that it would suffer irreparable harm
if the photo-exchange arrangement were discontinued.
   The request for the injunction stemmed from a counterclaim by
UPI to a Reuters lawsuit that seeks to void the picture exchange.
   The three judges of the appeals court reversed a decision made
in March by U.S. District Judge Peter K. Leisure denying the order,
which UPI appealed. Leisure was directed to issue the injunction.
   ``We believe the district court exceeded its discretion when it
concluded that UPI would not suffer immediate irreparable harm were
the preliminary injunction denied,'' the appeals court said in a
written opinion.
   The picture-exchange contract was made in 1984 and called for
UPI to supply Reuters with photographs from the United States and
for Reuters to provide UPI with pictures from other countries. The
agreement was to run for 10 years beginning in 1985.
   ``Reuters remains confident of its position. We are anxious to
get to trial where the merits of the case can be addressed,''
Robert Crooke, director of media relations for Reuters America,
said.
   Reuters claimed the agreement is not living up to its
expectations. UPI said it would lose clients and possibly go out of
business without foreign photos from Reuters.
   Reuters, headquartered in London, planned to establish its own
network of photo gathering in the United States.
   The appeals court found that Leisure, in denying the injunction,
had incorrectly relied on a commitment by the French news service,
Agence France-Presse, to supply UPI with foreign pictures for three
months.
   ``News and pictures are the lifeblood of the wire service
industry so that interrupting the flow of pictures even briefly
threatens a wire service company's continued viability,'' the court
said.
   The appeals judges who ruled in the case were Thomas J. Meskill,
Richard J. Cardamone and Lawrence W. Pierce.

   The oldest profession is a taxable profession, the
Court of Appeal ruled today, rejecting a woman's argument that the
government was not entitled to share her immoral earnings.
   ``The tax man is a pimp and the government is a pimp,'' Marion
Aken, d.b.a. Miss Whiplash or Lindi St. Claire, said outside court.
   Not so, the judges held.
   ``As regards the propriety of the Inland Revenue seeking to
recover the proceeds by tax of prostitution, the revenue
authorities are merely looking at the accomplished fact of profits
from trade,'' Lord Justice Fox said in giving the court's opinion.
   Lord Justice Parker added: ``There is no doubt that prostitution
is a trade.''
   Ms. Aken was ordered to pay $99,340, plus the government's legal
costs in responding to her appeal.
   At a hearing Tuesday, Ms. Aken sashayed into court in black
leather with accessories of handcuffs and a cat-o'-nine-tails whip.
The justices wore black silk robes with matching short wigs.
   Ms. Aken's lawyer, Ian MacDonald, had argued that since
brothel-keeping and prostitution are illegal she could not be taxed.
   MacDonald told the court his client came to the attention of the
Inland Revenue in 1979 when she incorporated her business, calling
it Lindi St. Claire (Personal Service) Ltd. The incorporation
documents declared the company's business was prostitution,
MacDonald said.
   This registration was later quashed by the High Court as being
for an unlawful purpose, MacDonald said, so his client should not
be required to pay taxes.
   Andrew Thornhill, representing the Inland Revenue, argued that
prostitution involved the provision of services and was therefore
taxable.
   Ms. Aken said today she no longer ran a brothel. She said she
has twice been convicted of keeping a brothel.

<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa today told
workers protesting low pay that the world will turn its back on
them unless they try to resolve disputes by discussion rather than
demonstrations.
   The shipyard workers, who make an average wage of $79 a month,
briefly left their jobs today to rally in front of the manager's
office to protest higher salaries for white-collar employees.
   Walesa urged them to give their own representatives and shipyard
officials time to work things out.
   ``If we are anarchical like this, the entire world will turn its
back on us as for not being serious,'' he said. ``You elected your
representatives and you should give them a chance to solve the
problems.''
   Walesa's talk was impromptu and came after Solidarity leaders
noticed him standing in the crowd.
   The previous Communist government planned to close the giant
Gdansk shipyard, the birthplace of Solidarity, because of its
unprofitablity. But the new Solidarity-led government is trying to
keep it open.
   The current plan is to sell shares in the state-owned shipyard
to private investors, reserving up to 20 percent to be sold to
employees at a discount.
   The economic reforms instituted by the new government have
caused consumer prices to soar and triggered fears of widespread
joblessness.
   The government expects 400,000 to become unemployed this year,
but the actual number of jobless is expected to be much higher.
   Labor Minister Jacek Kuron has said he agrees with World Bank
estimates that up to 1.7 million Poles could be put out of work.
   Currently, 360,000 people, or 2 percent of the workforce, are
unemployed.

<HEAD>With PM-Budget Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If President Bush can't cut the deficit
without a tax increase, then he and his advisers ``should return
their Republican cards,'' says Gov. Judd Gregg, a longtime ally of
the president.
   ``Republicans are sent to manage. They are not sent to say
`let's raise taxes when we get into tough economic times,''' Gregg
said in an interview published today in The (Manchester) Union
Leader.
   The Bush administration has been meeting with congressional
leaders to map out a budget strategy for fiscal 1991. Despite his
``read my lips'' campaign promise to avoid new taxes, Bush is
believed ready to consider a tax hike.
   Gregg and his father, former Gov. Hugh Gregg, have been Bush
champions since he began seeking the presidency.
   Gregg, who was elected governor two years ago on an anti-tax
platform, supported and signed into law millions of dollars' worth
of tax and fee increases earlier this year when a state budget
deficit loomed.
   Gregg spokesman Brian Grip said today that those taxes were only
adopted after spending cuts and money-saving measures were taken.
   Gregg compared Bush's budget approach unfavorably to that of
former President Reagan.
   ``This president has had some inordinate good luck,'' Gregg
said. ``When Ronald Reagan arrived at the White House he faced an
economic crisis of huge proportions with inflation at 12 percent,
interest rates at 22 percent and the country going into a recession.
   ``So he had to take very tough action, antagonize a lot of
people ... dramatically cut spending. Then he came in with the
Kemp-Roth tax cut on top of that.''
   Gregg served four terms in Congress during the Reagan years
before being elected governor in 1988. He succeeded Gov. John
Sununu, who became Bush's chief of staff.
   Gregg said the White House is ``talking about whether they can
reduce the deficit (by) ... taking about $40 billion of spending
out of a trillion-dollar budget. Now if they can't do that on the
spending side of the ledger, then, quite honestly, they should
return their Republican cards.''

<TEXT>
   A waiter fired from an expensive restaurant was
awarded $60,000 in back wages by a jury that found he was the
victim of AIDS discrimination.
   Jurors deliberated less than three hours Thursday before ruling
in favor of Ronald Gardner, who was dismissed from the Rainbow
Lodge in 1987. A judge must still approve the jury's verdict.
   ``I hope it's another tool that will be used to teach people
there's no reason people with AIDS should not be treated fairly,''
said Rick Levy, an attorney for Gardner.
   Gardner, still physically capable eight years after being
diagnosed with the deadly disease, beamed after announcement of the
verdict.
   ``Hopefully it will set a precedent with other PWAs (people with
AIDS) and any other person handicapped with any disease,'' Gardner
said.
   Howard R. King, attorney for the Rainbow Lodge, declined to
comment. The restaurant maintained that Gardner was fired not
because of AIDS but because he was late for work and sometimes
overcharged patrons.
   The lawsuit, which received an expedited hearing because of
Gardner's medical condition, alleged violations of the Texas
Commission on Human Rights Act protecting handicapped persons and
federal law related to an employee's right to receive insurance
benefits.
   Though jurors ruled the firing was discriminatory, they rejected
the argument that the restaurant's actions were designed to
interfere with Gardner's efforts to secure insurance benefits.
   The same day the jury made its ruling, the U.S. House of
Representatives narrowly approved an amendment that, if it becomes
law, could affect similar cases in the future.
   By a 199-187 vote, the House approved an amendment Thursday that
lets employers reassign workers with ``contagious diseases'' to
prevent them from handling food. The amendment was passed despite
opposition from the Bush administration, which stressed that casual
contact does not spread AIDS.

   Britain's governing
Conservative Party was trounced in its first entry into Northern
Ireland politics, finishing sixth in a parliamentary special
election, according to the tally announced today.
   David Trimble of the Ulster Unionist Party won 58 percent of the
votes to hold the Upper Bann district seat for his party, the
largest of the predominantly Protestant unionist parties.
   Brid Rodgers of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, a
predominantly Roman Catholic party, finished far behind in second
place.
   The Conservative candidate, Colette Jones, received 1,038 votes,
compared with Trimble's 20,547.
   ``The Conservatives have been well and truly humiliated,'' said
Jim Wilson, secretary of the Ulster Unionists.
   Mrs. Jones, however, said her party was not dismayed.
   ``I can promise that at the general election we will be fielding
candidates in all 17 seats. I think the electorate of Upper Bann
will learn that the national parties are the ones to vote for and
not the parochial parties sitting on the fringes,'' she said.
   Thursday's special election followed the death in March of
lawmaker Harold McCusker.
   Elections in Northern Ireland traditionally are contested along
sectarian lines. The Ulster Unionists and the Rev. Ian Paisley's
Democratic Unionist Party compete for Protestant votes, while Roman
Catholic votes largely go to the Social Democratic and Labor Party
or to Sinn Fein, the legal wing of the Irish Republican Army.
   The Labor Party, Britain's main opposition party, does not field
candidates in Northern Ireland.

   The Army will not force a gay man
expelled from ROTC to repay a $25,000 scholarship, but it denied
his request to be commissioned and serve in the military, his
lawyer said today.
   The Army emphasized that its decision in the case of James
Holobaugh was based ``solely on the merits and circumstances of
this particular case,'' according to a memo sent to his attorney in
New York.
   Holobaugh, 24, was informed Thursday by telephone of the Army's
decision, and a written confirmation was received today, said Bill
Rubenstein, an attorney with the ACLU's Lesbian and Gay Rights
Project.
   Holobaugh graduated today from Washington University in St.
Louis, where he had been a top performer in the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps. He even had appeared in an Army ROTC recruiting ad.
   After his superiors recommended in January that he be denied his
commission and be forced to repay his scholarship, he decided to
fulfill his remaining course requirements at the University of New
Haven.
   ``While I am pleased I will not have to repay the money, I am
terribly disappointed that the Army has not seen fit to grant me a
commission and to allow me to serve my country,'' Holobaugh said in
a statement released by his attorney.
   ``My case only serves to underscore the wastefulness of the
military's ban on lesbians and gay men,'' he said.
   Holobaugh said he intended to continue to pursue his commission
and his efforts ``to have the military abandon a policy that is
rooted in ignorance and prejudice.''
   ``The victory is significant because it shows that there are
limits to the military's mean-spiritedness,'' Rubenstein said.
   An engineering student, Holobaugh was scheduled to receive his
Army commission last May, a year before his graduation. But after
informing his superiors a month earlier that he had come to realize
he was gay, no commission was forthcoming.
   Earlier this month, the Navy announced it was dropping its bid
to force repayment of tuition from two cadets expelled from its
officer training program. In that case, too, the Navy emphasized
there had been no change in the Pentagon's ban on homosexuals in
the military.
   Rubenstein said the decision in the Holobaugh case was the
result of pressure generated by 24 congressmen who wrote to the
Army on Holobaugh's behalf, and a number of colleges, including
Washington University.

<TEXT>
   A prominent real estate broker on Martha's
Vineyard was sentenced to five years in prison for fraudulently
collecting nearly half a million dollars in deposits for oceanfront
properties.
   State police said Judith C. Strimel, 41, took $485,000 in
deposits from September 1986 to January 1989 for three waterfront
homes in Edgartown, some of which, like the home of Washington Post
Co. chairman Katharine Graham, were not even for sale.
   The money was later transferred from escrow to business accounts
at Mrs. Strimel's firm, Avery and Company, of Edgartown.
   Slumping sales prompted the fraud, said Richard Piazza,
assistant district attorney for the Cape and the Islands.
   ``The business took a downturn and her lifestyle didn't,''
Piazza said in a telephone interview Thursday.
   Only one of the properties was actually for sale. Mrs. Strimel
was able to gain access to the houses she pretended were for sale
because she was known to most on the island as a reputable broker.
   ``These were great big beautiful homes and they all had
caretakers who knew her and let her in,'' said Piazza. ``I call her
a common thief.''
   Piazza said that Mrs. Strimel had worked with Mrs. Graham in the
past when she was looking at houses.
   Mrs. Strimel's Boston attorney, Howard Miller, said Thursday
that he could not comment on the case.
   She was indicted by a Dukes County grand jury in April 1989. She
also received a second, suspended sentence of three to five years
and was placed on probation for five years. She was ordered to pay
restitution and was prohibited from ever practicing real estate
again. She will be eligible for parole in six months.
   Mrs. Strimel is part of a well-known island family of Portuguese
descent, Piazza said. The state park there is named after her
grandfather. Her husband, George Strimel, who testified on her
behalf, was her second husband. Her first was the police chief of
Edgartown.
   During the sentencing May 1 in Dukes County Superior Court, both
Strimels gave emotional testimony.
   ``I want to express my profound sorrow at what I have done,''
said Mrs. Strimel, as she began to cry. ``I am deeply sorry. I have
changed my plea to guilty and I am ready to accept whatever
punishment you deem appropriate.''

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze reported progress today
toward reaching an agreement to reduce strategic nuclear weapons.
   ``I have always believed the main points will be agreed upon,''
Shevardnadze said. ``Things are moving in that direction.''
   Baker also gave an upbeat assessment after nearly five hours of
talks with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. ``We made some
progress ... We still have a number of issues that are still out
there,'' he said.
   On another arms control front, Shevardnadze told reporters that
``major progress'' has been made on a U.S.-Soviet accord to end
production of chemical weapons.
   Baker took time out to meet with Prime Minister Kazimiera
Prunskiene of Lithuania and then returned to the bargaining table
with Shevardnadze.
   The goal is agreement on reducing U.S. and Soviet long-range
missiles, bombers and submarines in time for Gorbachev's summit
with President Bush in Washington May 31-June 3.
   ``We did a lot,'' Shevardnadze said. ``We accomplished a lot
today.''
   Bush last week offered to halt U.S. production of chemical
weapons if the Soviets were willing to schedule the destruction of
their poison gas stockpiles. Shevardnadze gave no details of the
emerging accord.
   Asked whether an agreement on key issues would be ready for the
summit, Baker replied: ``We keep hoping we can accomplish that.''
   Earlier, in the Kremlin, Gorbachev said his side was doing its
best to stitch together an agreement. He had been accused of
backsliding by the Bush administration before Baker's arrival here
Tuesday.
   The Soviet leader said he did not know if the goal would be met,
but told reporters: ``I think we are moving closer.''
   Similarly mixed signals came from the U.S. side, where officials
spoke both of continuing gaps and of hopes for accord. Without a
compromise on air and sea-launched cruise missiles and other
disputed weapons, the summit will lack the dramatic centerpiece
President Bush and Gorbachev anticipated.
   After the Gorbachev meeting, Baker saw Mrs. Prunskiene, thereby
giving at least symbolic U.S. support to Lithuania's independence
drive.
   ``We are still very hopeful, as we have been for some time, that
a dialogue can begin,'' Baker said of the long-held U.S. hope that
the Soviets would negotiate terms for independence with the Baltics.
   Mrs. Prunskiene met Thursday with Gorbachev, who then discussed
the situation in the Baltics with Baker.
   ``It remains to be seen the degree to which that will be
continued,'' Baker said without explanation.
   Gorbachev is trying to keep the Soviet Union from splintering as
he struggles to vitalize the economy and expand political freedom.
   Asked to respond to analysts who say he is having trouble
keeping his head above water, Gorbachev shot back: ``They should
follow closely what is happening in the Soviet Union, and they
should objectively reflect on what is happening in this country.
   ``They should not panic more than the Soviets do,'' he said with
a smile.
   Turning to arms control, Gorbachev said he did not know if key
issues in a Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) treaty could be
concluded by the summit.
   ``We are doing our best to make sure that we agree,'' Gorbachev
said. ``We have to do this together.''
   Baker's meeting with Mrs. Prunskiene drew no apparent objections
from the Soviet leader.
   ``We are not seeking to send any message by meeting with her,''
a senior U.S. official said Thursday night. ``It obviously gives us
a chance to hear more about her concerns.''
   The official said Baker would extend his visit beyond Saturday
after there was a chance of an arms accord.
   ``The work is intense right now,'' said the official, who
briefed reporters under rules guaranteeing him anonymity. ``We are
really slogging through a lot. I think it is fair to say that if
the gap was seen as being unbridgeable we wouldn't be working
intensively.''
   When Baker told Shevardnadze that he would see Mrs. Prunskiene,
``his reaction was a non-reaction,'' the official said.
   The prime minister saw Gorbachev in the Kremlin Thursday
evening, reversing the Soviet leader's refusal to meet with the
leaders of the secessionist republics of Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia.
   Gorbachev had demanded that Lithuania revoke its March 11
declaration of independence, but on Thursday he asked merely for a
suspension, Mrs. Prunskiene told reporters.
   Even so, the senior U.S. official insisted the Soviets had not
met Baker's demand for a dialogue with the Baltic leaders.
   ``It is not enough simply to talk about a need for dialogue,''
he said. ``You have to do something that makes it happen. And they
are continuing to stick to a position that accepts dialogue, but
only under certain conditions.''
   When Baker arrived Tuesday from Washington the request from Mrs.
Prunskiene for a meeting was given to him by U.S. Ambassador Jack
F. Matlock Jr. She had earlier met in Washington with Bush, but her
talk with Baker in the Soviet capital, amid summit preparations,
put an interesting twist on the situation.
   Baker has already informed the Soviets that failure to resolve
the dispute with the Baltics could interfere with an improvement in
U.S.-Soviet relations at the summit.

Surveillance</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The State Department today won the right to
use evidence gathered through electronic surveillance in
proceedings to dismiss suspected spy Felix S. Bloch from the
foreign service.
   A federal judge said in an order released today that the
electronic surveillances were conducted lawfully under the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Harris rejected a contention by
Bloch's attorneys that the surveillances were illegal and could not
be used in the State Department dismissal hearing.
   The proceeding had been scheduled to begin last week but was
postponed pending court action on the case.
   While not charged with any crime, Bloch has been suspected by
the FBI of selling secrets to the Soviet Union when he was posted
in Europe as a diplomat, most recently at the U.S. Embassy in
Vienna.
   Bloch, a 30-year veteran of the diplomatic corps, was placed on
administrative leave last June after the investigation began.
   On Feb. 8, the State Department said it had suspended Bloch's
annual salary of $80,700 and would seek to dismiss him from the
foreign service.
   The FBI conducted extensive surveillance of Bloch last summer
while the case was under active investigation.
   The surveillance ended late last year after the bureau decided
it was unlikely it could prove that Bloch passed classified
information to the Soviet Union, according to law enforcement
sources.
   The judge also denied a request by Bloch's lawyers to inspect
all tapes and transcipts of conversations recorded during the
surveillance.
   The Justice Department had argued that giving Bloch more
information about the surveillance would hurt national security.
   Harris found that Bloch ``is not entitled to any further secret
information obtained by or related to the electronic surveillance.''

<TEXT>
   A Japanese businessman who once sold off a large
part of his art collection to help his ailing company returned to
the market this week, setting auction house records with his
purchase of two paintings.
   Industrialist Ryoei Saito confirmed today that he had bought
Renoir's ``Au Moulin de la Galette'' on Thursday for $78.1 million
at an auction at Sotheby's in New York.
   Van Gogh's ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' was purchased Tuesday by
the Kobayashi Gallery of Tokyo for Saito, the 74-year-old chairman
emeritus of the Daishowa Paper Manufacturing Co.
   Saito told The Associated Press in a telephone interview this
evening that he had not expected to win the auctions.
   ``They are world-class, wonderful works,'' he said.
   Prior to the Renoir sale, five of the 11 most expensive
paintings sold at auction had been bought by Japanese bidders.
   The somber portrait by Vincent Van Gogh of his doctor was sold
for $82.5 million _ the highest purchase price ever paid at auction
for a painting.
   Saito served as president of Daishowa between 1971 and 1982 and
is said to remain its de facto leader. Newspapers said two of his
children are president and chairman of the company.
   His younger brother is state governor of Shizuoka prefecture,
where the Saito clan resides and Daishowa has one of its corporate
headquarters.
   Japanese newspapers said Saito plans to borrow money on his
considerable land holdings to pay for the two paintings. He is
frequently listed among Japan's richest men. According to the
Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, Saito paid more than $5 million in taxes
last year.
   Known as a veteran art collector, Saito amassed a substantial
collection during the postwar era. However, he had to sell off many
works after the oil shocks of the 1970s, when his paper concern hit
bad times. Profits have since revived, Japanese newspapers said,
enabling him to indulge in his favorite hobby.
   Following the Van Gogh purchase, Saito told the Yomiuri
newspaper: ``It cost 5 billion yen ($33 million) more than I
expected, but that's nothing. Next I want the Renoir.''

   Customs agents found 37 snakes, including a

border check, an official said Friday.
   ``The customs officer who did the check was a little surprised
when he opened the suitcase, but not much. We are used to a lot,''
said the customs official, Jan Flink.
   Nine of the snakes were poisonous, he said.
   The unidentified traveler, who arrived on a car ferry Thursday,
told police he had intended to sell the snakes.
   The man was briefly detained and could be charged with
smuggling. The snakes were confiscated.

   About 40 domestic flights were canceled
and international traffic was delayed up to three hours after air
traffic controllers refused to work overtime Friday, officials said.
   ``At the moment it is impossible to say for how long this
situation will continue,'' said Rune Andersson, chief of air
traffic control at Arlanda airport outside Stockholm.
   The controllers are negotiating for higher pay for the extra
hours, saying they are short-staffed because authorities failed to
anticipate increased air traffic.
   The negotiations could last through the month, Andersson said.
   Andersson said a 1983 study had predicted air traffic would
decline and fewer controllers were trained.
   ``Instead the air traffic has increased tremendously and that is
why we have problems now,'' Andersson said. He said it takes four
years to recruit and train a controller.

<HEAD>Penny-Pinching Pittsburgh Switching to Third Of July</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city is moving its Fourth of July
celebrations to July 3 because of higher overtime rates in a new
contract to police officers.
   The switch will save about $16,000 in police salaries and $4,000
in pay to other city workers, said James Turner, the city's chief
administrative officer. An arbitration panel in February awarded
the Fraternal Order of Police a 5 percent salary increase for each
of the next two years along with substantial increases in overtime
pay differentials.
   ``We realize there will be some pain in the short notice we had
to give this year on the switch, but the FOP arbitration award was
beyond our wildest nightmare, coming in at double what we had
projected,'' Turner said.
   The contract requires the city to compensate 16 hours of pay to
officers called to work on their day off. The former contract
mandated only six hours. ``As long as we have to live with an
arbitration award like this, the Fourth of July is going to be on
the third of July,'' mayoral spokesman Albert J. Neri said. ``There
actually was serious consideration given to scrapping the
celebration.''
   Patrick McNamarah, president of the police union, said there are
190 officers working on the Fourth of July, and 160 officers on
July 3. He said the city will not save money by moving the
celebration, but in fact will spend more because they will have to
call at least 30 more officers into work on July 3.
   Parks Director Louise Brown said the switch will encourage
people to remain downtown for the celebration and spend money at
restaurants and other businesses before the concert.
   ``And, since most offices are closed the following day, the
public can celebrate during the July 3 evening and still have the
following day to spend with friends and family,'' Ms. Brown said.
   Tom Casciotti, manager of the Georgetowne Inn atop Mount
Washington, which overlooks downtown Pittsburgh, said the change
may cause the restaurant to rethink its plans.
   The restaurant was to be closed on July 4, when hordes of
sightseers come to Mount Washington to view the fireworks.
   The change ``will be more trouble than its worth,'' Casciotti
said. ``I really think (the fireworks) should be on the Fourth. ...
The Fourth is the Fourth. Everybody's off on the Fourth.''

   A prosecutor said today he won't press
charges against a man whose rubbish fire allegedly touched off a
forest fire last week that left scores of people homeless.
   Crawford County Prosecutor John Huss said he believes a fire the
homeowner set March 16 smoldered underground for two months before
rekindling once on April 16 and again May 8, the day of the forest
fire.
   The cause involved an ``incredibly bizarre set of circumstances
... and leads me to conclude that there was no criminal
violation,'' Huss said.
   Huss made his decision Thursday afternoon and notified
Department of Natural Resources officials in Lansing before making
it public today.
   DNR agents investigating the May 8 fire had asked Huss for a
criminal warrant, said regional division supervisor Capt. H.R. Hill
in Roscommon.
   Michigan foresters from the beginning said the blaze likely
started with flying embers from a rubbish fire.
   The fire destroyed 81 homes, 115 other buildings and 37 boats
and vehicles. It cut an eight-mile path through the woods, burning
about 6,000 acres of woodland, including about 300 acres of nesting
ground for the endangered Kirtland's warbler.
   About half the people who lost their homes were year-round
residents, many of them elderly and underinsured, authorities said.
Red Cross officials said Thursday they still are determining how
many people were left homeless.
   Crawford County officials estimate the loss is $3.5 million,
excluding timber value. They said property values in the region
will remain depressed for years.

   Federal agents who suspected that
smugglers had developed an underground pipeline crossing the
Mexican border found a tunnel today ``like something out of a James
Bond movie,'' a Customs spokeswoman said.
   The tunnel was about the length of a football field and 30 feet
underground, Judy Turner, a Customs spokeswoman in Houston, said in
telephone interviews.
   She said it was 5 feet high, 4 feet wide, well lighted, and had
concrete piers for support. At various points were compartments
where up to five tons of drugs could be stashed.
   One entrance was in a Douglas warehouse about 200 feet north of
the border, and the other was in a house in Agua Prieta, Mexico,
only 73 feet south of the fence that separates the border cities,
Ms. Turner said.
   The house featured a compressor-operated system of hydraulic
jacks that raised and lowered the entire floor of the structure for
entrance to the tunnel.
   ``It was just an exceptionally, professionally engineered
tunnel,'' Ms. Turner said. ``It was something that you and I in the
ordinary world would only find in the movies. It was like something
out of a James Bond movie.
   ``It also points up the fact of why the Southwest border is
considered such a high-intensity drug-trafficking area.''
   She said agents believe it took six months to dig the tunnel and
that it had been used for about six months.
   Federal agents used jackhammers and torches to break into the
tunnel this morning.
   Ms. Turner said Customs had suspected the tunnel's existence and
that agents used aerial surveillance to track the shipment of 2,258
pounds of cocaine from Douglas to a spot outside Phoenix on May 11.
There they confiscated the haul and arrested two people.
   Mexican authorities arrested two other people late Thursday or
early today in Agua Prieta, Ms. Turner said.
   Federal agents searched several residences in Douglas and seized
a ranch near Phoenix and two businesses _ the Douglas Building
Supply Co. and Douglas Redi-Mix Cement Co.
   Ms. Turner did not immediately know the identities of those
arrested.

   The leftist
presidential candidate claimed he was trailing in the vote count
because of election fraud and called for street protests today, but
Dominicans returned to work instead.
   With nearly 80 percent of the polling stations reporting,
Conservative President Joaquin Balaguer led his leftist opponent,
Juan Bosch, by more than than 11,000 votes, according to the
Central Electoral Board.
   Bosch on Thursday charged ``colossal fraud'' in vote counting
and said he would call for street protests today, ``no matter what
the consequences.''
   But former President Jimmy Carter, one of 30 international
election observers, said Thursday he saw ``no evidence of fraud or
manipulation'' in the vote count. He urged the candidates to remain
calm and wait for final results.
   There were no signs early today that police were preparing for
any protests, and there were no large gatherings at Bosch's party
headquarters.
   But there was a disturbance when Bosch arrived at the
headquarters.
   Army sources said a military intelligence agent was disarmed and
roughed up by Bosch's followers. But there were conflicting reports
about what happened.
   Bosch's followers said the man drew a revolver as the candidate
stepped out of his vehicle. An army spokesman confirmed the man was
a military intelligence agent but denied that he had drawn a weapon.
   The spokesman said the agent was disarmed and beaten by Bosch's
followers when they noticed he was armed. He said the man was
slightly injured and rushed to a hospital in a police car. Bosch
then met with party officials.
   For the first time since Wednesday's vote, commuters filled the
streets. Although the day after an election is not an official
holiday, Dominicans traditionally stay home to await the returns.
   Bosch, 80, a former president overthrown by a 1963 military
coup, called a news conference to protest the vote count after
losing a narrow early lead to Balaguer, the blind, 83-year-old
incumbent.
   He accused both Balaguer and the election board of fraud.
   The electoral board announced on television Thursday night that
election law barred any public demonstrations while the vote count
continued. The announcement was repeated several times.
   The election pis the rivals for the presidency of the Caribbean
nation against each other for a fifth time. Balaguer has won three
of those races.
   With 5,522 of the 6,663 polling stations reporting, Balaguer had
543,610 votes and Bosch 532,340, official results showed. Jose
Francisco Pena Gomez, a former Bosch protege, was a distant third
with 356,593.
   About 3.2 million people were registered to vote nationwide.
   On Thursday, Bosch said: ``The Central Electoral Board and Dr.
Balaguer committed a colossal fraud.''
   ``We are announcing that PDL is going into the streets because
the people have been cheated,'' Bosch said, referring to his
Dominican Liberation Party. ``What remains of my life has no
meaning if this fraud takes place.''
   But Pena Gomez, a former Socialist mayor of Santo Domingo, said
the election board had agreed to review each polling station's
tally sheet. He said he proposed the review to Balaguer.
   ``President Balaguer accepted the proposal ... and said he was
disposed to accept that international observers participate in the
verification of the sheets,'' Pena Gomez said.
   He earlier urged Bosch to withdraw his call for street protests,
which he said could cause a bloodbath.
   ``And I ask Balaguer not to bring out the armed forces to
confront protesters,'' Pena Gomez told reporters.
   Balaguer made no immediate comment. He has remained out of
public view since casting his ballot Wednesday. Soldiers guarded
his residence.
   Officials of Bosch's party met Thursday with six of the 30
international observers monitoring the election. Oscar Ayerve of
Ecuador said there was concern over the slow vote count, but he did
not elaborate.
   Before the election, Bosch said his party had information that
Balaguer's Social Christian Reformist Party had prepared 300,000
phony ballots to rig the election, a charge denied by Balaguer
party officials.
   Bosch, an author, intellectual and self-described Marxist, ran
on a moderate platform, endorsing capitalism as the best way to
improve his country's economic plight.
   Balaguer was first elected president in 1966 and served three
consecutive four-year terms before losing in 1978. He was
re-elected in 1986.
   Over the past four years, he has presided over a $2 billion
public-works project to transform centuries-old Santo Domingo. The
project has created thousands of jobs, but economic problems
persisted and his popularity slumped.

   When Stacey Hoover was growing up on a
poultry farm, her mother teased her that she'd be married in a
turkey barn. Miss Hoover will have the last laugh Saturday.
   She's getting married in a barn that housed 6,000 turkeys until
two weeks ago.
   She's also marrying a Butcher.
   ``Mom always joked about my getting married in a turkey barn,''
said the 23-year-old Miss Hoover, whose fiance in Mark Butcher.
   ``Mark and I have close to 225 people coming to our wedding, and
there is no church big enough in Newport to hold that many people.
So I decided, why not get married in one of our turkey barns?''
   Miss Hoover, who now lives in Silver Spring Township, said she
met Butcher four years ago while they were students at Delaware
Valley College in Doylestown, north of Philadelphia.
   The Hoovers have two farms in the Newport area and own a meat
and produce store and farm near Mechanicsburg. Miss Hoover runs the
store while her fiance, who lives in Spring Grove, manages the farm
operations.
   The bride-to-be said her parents, Jim and Sandra Hoover of
Newport, have been supportive of her plans.
   ``At first, they laughed,'' she said. ``Then they found out that
we meant it. We're getting married in the newest of our three
turkey barns.''
   The turkeys have been moved out to make way for wedding guests,
flowers, an organ and a harp.
   Miss Hoover she plans a ``very traditional service _ as serious
as if we were in church.''
   After the ceremony, the guests will head to a reception at the
Carlisle Country Club, where they will feast on roast turkey.
   ``I can't believe that this is materializing after all these
years,'' said Mrs. Hoover, adding that she never really expected
her daughter to get married in a turkey barn.
   Miss Hoover joked about her married name. ``My name will be
Butcher, which is good since we own a butcher shop,'' she laughed.
``I always wanted to do something different in getting married, and
this is it. Besides, it's home, it's our surrounding and it's our
life. Farming brought us together.''

<HEAD>Growing Fears Among East Germans Facing Unification</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>POTSDAM, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German worker Alfons Domke is
already worried his 8-month-old daughter will one day be tempted by
illegal drugs like those plaguing the West. And he fears
unification might cost his wife's job.
   Hotel executive Gabriele Gaertner says she worries that 40
percent of East Germany's workers will lose their jobs, as the
coming merger with West Germany forces a widespread economic
shakeout.
   Talks with ordinary East Germans reveal growing fears among a
people who for 40 years lived a nearly cocoon-like existence that
some West Germans scornfully call ``the sleep of Sleeping Beauty.''
   It's a long way from last fall's scenes of East Germans
clamoring for freedom and a chance to follow Western ways.
   ``Things are just going too quickly,'' said Ms. Gaertner, public
relations manager at one of East Germany's most successful hotels.
   ``Before, people said they needed to travel or have a car, but
that's not so important now. Now, existence is what's important.''
   Increasingly, there are nationwide signs of those concerns.
   For more than a week, East German teachers, railroad workers,
farmers and textile workers have held sporadic strikes to demand
job protection as the nations are unified.
   East German voters March 18 gave the conservatives the upper
hand in this country of 16.6 million people, after hearing West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's stump speeches and promises of
prosperity.
   Now, East Germans are learning that prosperity won't come
easily, and there have been estimates that hundreds of thousands
will be out of work and living on unemployment benefits for several
years.
   Ms. Gaertner, an executive at the elegant Schloss Cecilienhof
Hotel in Potsdam just outside Berlin, said one of her neighbors got
caught in a double squeeze related to unification. He will lose his
job at an outmoded business on July 1, and a West German has shown
up to reclaim the property where he lives.
   The 37-year-old woman bristles at West German suggestions that
their East German cousins are lazy and unwilling to put in the long
hours needed to rebuild their country.
   ``Some of the things you hear from the West Germans at the
reception desk on the weekends just aren't that nice,'' she said.
   Ms. Gaertner said she fears 40 percent layoffs in many sectors,
particularly in the creaking and antiquated factories in the south.
She said that could lead to dissatisfaction and possibly unrest.
   A department chief in one of East Germany's government
ministries agrees, despite West German promises of investments and
new jobs.
   ``Yes, with 25 percent unemployment, I fear there could be a lot
of unrest,'' said the government worker, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. He told The Associated Press that whole businesses
likely will start to go under within weeks after East Germany
adopts the West German currency on July 2.
   Domke works 12 hours a day as a parking lot attendant in
Potsdam. His dream is to open a private taxi business that one day
will expand into a bus company.
   ``This is a time of great uncertainty, because no one knows
what's really coming. But it's also a time of great joy now that we
can travel freely to the West,'' the 24-year-old father said in
between collecting money from drivers.
   But he, too, has worries.
   Domke said illegal drugs are already coming in from West Berlin,
and he fears they could become a scourge by the time his baby,
Nancy, grows up.
   ``Drugs, yes, that's my first worry for her,'' he said. ``Then,
of course, crime is up.''
   His wife, Nicole, who is about to turn 21, is enjoying a
government-guaranteed paid year off after Nancy's birth. But she is
afraid the shop where she worked as a hairdresser won't need her
when she returns in August.
   Domke says Potsdam, a town of 150,000, has 20,000 unemployed
people. Official statistics say there were about 65,000 people out
of work nationwide last month, although the actual number is
believed to be far higher than that.
   Helmut Knerich, a state-employed building engineer from the
nearby town of Werder, is careful to say he is ``worried'' but not
``afraid'' about his continued future employment.
   Knerich, 53, claims the former Communist Party and the Social
Democrats are trying to drive up the fears, the former because of
opposition to unification and the latter in hopes of slowing down
the pace.
   The leftist-leaning Social Democrats are part of East Germany's
coalition government, but have hinted at a pullout if the headlong
rush to unification goes unchecked.
   The government has tried to calm the fears.
   Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, during the signing of a
treaty that will bring the two nations closer together, said Friday
the pact will not fulfill all of East Germans' ``flowery dreams.
   But he pledged that ``no one will be worse off than before.''

   Hungary's acting president said President Bush
assured him today that the issue of Soviet troop withdrawals from
Eastern Europe would be on the agenda at the upcoming U.S.-Soviet
summit.
   Arpad Goncz met with Bush during a hurriedly scheduled session
in the Oval Office.
   Goncz said Bush asked him about the tense situation in Lithuania.
   ``The unfolding processes in the Baltic states simply cannot be
reversed any more,'' Goncz said he told Bush.
   The two leaders spoke as Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
and Lithuanian officials appeared to be making progress on a
dialogue to resolve the volatile situation. Lithuania appears to be
toning down its effort to secede from the Soviet Union.
   Goncz told reporters outside the White House that he and Bush
agreed that ``Soviet troop withdrawal from Czechoslovakia and
Hungary and other countries of the region should proceed as
concluded in the different bilateral agreements. And we also agreed
that this topic would be discussed at the summit.''
   The White House said Bush and Goncz also agreed on the need for
dialogue between Soviet and Lithuania leaders as a ``prerequisite
for creating a stable environment in which the countries of Central
and Eastern Europe can consolidate their democratic reforms.''
   Bush ``also stressed the importance of maintaining a strong U.S.
presence in Europe, including a military presence as a guarantee of
stability,'' White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in a
statement.
   Goncz is on an unofficial visit to the United States. Bush had
been willing to meet with Goncz, but did not get a firm date on the
visit until late, said White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk.
   Bush was leaving later in the day for a four-day trip to the
Western United States.
   Goncz said he wanted continued U.S. support and financial
assistance for his country's new democracy, as well as support in
the international financial institutions such as the World Bank.
   On Thursday, Bush met with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to
discuss the upcoming summit.
   Bush's meeting with Kohl wrapped up a series of consultations
with allied leaders before his meeting with Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev. The Washington summit begins May 31.
   Bush insisted that Germany should not be singled out for special
status by the Soviet Union, which wants a unified Germany to be
neutral or a member of both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
and the Warsaw Pact.
   Kohl said his nation's choice ``is and will always be'' NATO,
but he also urged that the alliance concentrate more on its
political role rather than its military one.
   As he left the White House, he thanked Bush for the
``magnificent support'' he had given ``Germans on our path to
German unity.''
   Bush travels tonight to Dallas for a Republican fund-raising
dinner that will be attended by embattled GOP gubernatorial
candidate Clayton Williams.
   On Saturday, he will participate in the Doug Sanders celebrity
pro-am golf tournament in Houston, then gives the commencement
address at the University of Texas in Austin.
   On Sunday, Bush will be in Portland, Ore., to help dedicate a
memorial to slain police officers. He will attend a Portland
fund-raising breakfast Monday for gubernatorial candidate Dave
Frohnmayer, the state attorney general.
   The president wraps up the trip in Los Angeles, where he will
honor a Venice neighborhood watch group and attend a state GOP
fund-raising event.
   Bush's meeting with Kohl followed recent pre-summit sessions
with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, French President
Francois Mitterrand and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
   Kohl told reporters ``nobody knows'' whether German unity would
come before the end of the year. ``But everything's going very
well. We can say that,'' he said through a translator during an
Oval Office photo session.

<HEAD>Greyhound Drivers: Were They Ready for All-Out War?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Battle-scarred labor movement veterans say the
Greyhound drivers' strike may be languishing because their union
wasn't fully prepared when it struck the nation's largest bus line
March 2.
   Union leaders say, however, that their 6,300 members were
well-equipped when they walked off their jobs. Drivers were forced
to strike because they had taken wage cuts for a decade and the
company was trying to implement ``horrendous'' wage rules, they say.
   ``Anybody can be that Monday morning quarterback and say you're
not prepared, but if you have no choice, you have to strike,'' said
Ellis B. Franklin, vice president of the Amalgamated Transit Union.
   Greyhound has hired 3,000 replacement workers and declared the
strike over.
   As the union now struggles to keep the walkout alive, it's
facing critics from inside organized labor at the same time it
confronts management.
   ``Here we have a company that relies on working-class people for
its riders, yet we haven't gotten the message out, `Hey, don't ride
Greyhound; nobody wins when a company treats its workers like
this,''' said one union official who asked to remain unidentified.
   Critics note that the Amalgamated Transit Union's quick decision
to walk out contrasts with the Pittston coal strike last year, when
miners worked without a contract for more than a year before
walking out.
   At the AFL-CIO's annual retreat last February in Bal Harbour,
Fla., strike-tested organized labor leaders cautioned the Greyhound
union about the perils of striking, say sources familiar with the
private meeting.
   ``There was a concern that these guys just weren't ready for
all-out war,'' said a source, speaking anonymously.
   Earlier this week, the union won a key National Labor Relations
Board decision that could eventually force the company to hire back
strikers. But Greyhound plans to appeal the ruling, which could
drag out the dispute for months or even years.
   The labor movement, trying to rebound from a loss of stature in
the 1980s, has been pushing unions to use more sophisticated
strategies to avoid strikes yet gain new and better contracts.
   In last year's Pittston strike, for example, miners worked
without a contract for 14 months while building support among
communities, church groups and other unions.
   Miners eventually won key bargaining issues after a 10-month
strike that sparked sympathy strikes in several states.
   Greyhound drivers, in contrast, ``walked right into the hands of
the company'' by striking the day their contract expired, one union
official said.
   Victor Kamber, a labor public relations specialist, said the
drivers' union should have had a strategy rather than ``sitting at
a table, pounding your fists and saying, `We're going to walk.'''
   Union officials acknowledge they were caught somewhat off guard
in the weeks leading up to the strike, but say it was because they
underestimated management's resolve not to bargain.
   ``I guess,'' said Edward M. Strait, president of the Amalgamated
Council of Local Greyhound Unions, ``we didn't want to believe it.''
   Greyhound drivers could have moved more quickly to enlist help
from the rest of the labor movement _ as workers at the New York
Daily News have done, analysts said.
   Even though Daily News employees are still working as they try
to resolve a contract dispute, the AFL-CIO already has printed
bumper stickers in support of the unions involved.
   Daily News workers have dealt with Kamber's public relations
company since November. The Greyhound drivers did not retain help
for publicity until a few days before the strike.
   Union leaders who defend the strike note that in past disputes,
such as the Pittston strike, pundits were quick to declare a
management victory only to see the situation reverse itself later.
   ``Everybody was writing the mine workers' epitaph a few months
into that strike, too. It's real easy to second-guess and say,
`They shouldn't have struck; they should have done this,''' said
John Duray of the United Mine Workers.
   Greyhound spokesman George Gravley denied that the company tried
to break the union and said the company was forced to look for
other workers when union members refused a what he called a
fair-wage proposal.
   ``They priced themselves right out of the market,'' Gravley said.

   Barbara Bush welcomed museum operators to the
White House on Friday, telling them they ``hold the cultural legacy
of America.''
   ``Museums have always been such a rich and enlightening part of
my life,'' Mrs. Bush told more than 300 museum directors.
   The directors attending the White House reception had been given
grants by the Institute of Museum Services, an independent federal
agency funded by Congress that awards $25 million in grants each
year to help museums operate.
   ``All ages, all income levels, all cultures, everyone is welcome
(at museums). This universal accessibility is crucial,'' Mrs. Bush
said. ``You hold the cultural legacy of America, and you make
unique contributions to the cultural literacy of our people.''
   The institute said its grants are based on excellence in
operating standards.

<TEXT>
   Is ``Moo'' too close to ``Mooo?''
   That's what a state district court is being asked to decide in a
lawsuit filed by a Lubbock restaurant against a Dallas-based
restaurant chain.
   Yet Inc., which operates two Bob York's Western Sizzlin'
restaurants here, filed suit Wednesday against Dallas-based Western
Sizzlin' Inc., alleging the chain has begun using ``Moo'' in
advertising.
   Yet Inc. claims it created the ``Mooo'' slogan in 1984 and has
used it on a variety of company materials, including Mooo saddles
for children, Mooo horns to wear and ``Mooonues'' from which to
order a Mooo meal.
   The suit alleges Western Sizzlin' Inc. dropped an ``o'' from the
Lubbock slogan and illegally appropriated the similar ``Moo''
designation for its own ``Moo U'' (for the company's restaurant
management training center), ``Moo-Lah'' (for a payroll program for
its restaurant services) and Moo News (a company newsletter).
   The suit asks that the chain be ordered to stop using the word
``Moo'' and any related words or phrases.
   The Lubbock company wants the court to rule that Yet Inc. ``has
protected service mark and trademark rights to the word and sound
``Mooo'' and that it should be awarded'' actual and consequential
damages including lost profits because of the alleged violation.
   The suit specifies no amount of monet about the matter.

<TEXT>
   A 19-year-old was convicted in the shooting
death of a black teen-ager set upon by a white gang last summer, a
murder that brought simmering racial tensions to a boil in the
nation's biggest city.
   Joseph Fama was convicted Thursday of second-degree murder by
depraved indifference for the Aug. 23 death of 16-year-old Yusuf
Hawkins. A mob of 30 bat-wielding youths attacked Hawkins when he
entered the mostly white Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn with
three friends to buy a used car.
   The Bensonhurst case has been watched closely by the city. It
may have contributed indirectly to the election of New York's first
black mayor, and many feared an acquittal in the case could have
led to violent outbreaks.
   Fama shook his head slightly, then stared at the floor as the
jury convicted him of the murder charge and 12 lesser charges.
   He was acquitted of second-degree intentional murder and
criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree. Jurors said
they convicted Fama despite a disagreement over whether he fired
the gun.
   Fama faces 25 years to life in prison when sentenced June 11 by
Judge Thaddeus Owens.
   A second panel deciding the fate of co-defendant Keith Mondello
resumed deliberations late this morning for an 11th day. About half
an hour later, the jurors asked the judge for a definition of
unlawful imprisonment, one of the lesser charges Mondello faces,
and Owens listed seven criteria.
   Mondello, also 19, is charged with two counts of second-degree
murder, manslaughter and other crimes in the attack. Four other
youths face trial later.
   ``We hope that this is the last time we ever have to try one of
these cases,'' said Assistant District Attorney James Kohler. ``But
something tells me that we'll be back here again trying another one
of these cases, until people learn how to get along with one
another, and stop all of this racial hatred.''
   Many said the shooting helped end the 12-year reign of Mayor Ed
Koch by convincing Democratic voters to select David Dinkins, his
more softspoken opponent, in the September primary. Dinkins went on
to become the city's first black mayor.
   Although Fama was accused of pulling a .32-caliber automatic
pistol and firing four shots, two of them through Hawkins' heart,
jurors said they were not convinced that he was the triggerman.
   But they said his decision to join the white mob in the attack
was sufficient to find him guilty of murder for participating in
the slaying.
   ``If he wasn't an active participant he could have gone home,''
said Steven Berquist, a telephone company employee who said he was
the last one of the 12 panelists to be convinced of Fama's guilt.
   Hawkins' parents, Moses Stewart and Diane Hawkins, sat holding
hands as jury forewoman Tonya Bailey delivered the verdict in the
packed fourth-floor courtroom.
   When the first guilty verdict was read, Stewart let out a quick
``Yeah!'' Several of the 12 jurors, who had deliberated for 10
days, wiped tears away as the forewoman spoke.
   Dinkins said the verdict was an occasion to begin healing the
city's racial wounds.
   ``Yusuf Hawkins died of racism in the first degree,'' he said.
``More than 20 years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., envisioned a
promised land where people would be judged by the content of their
character rather than the color of their skin.
   ``I can think of no greater tribute to Yusuf or to his family,
nor a nobler quest for the people of our city, than for us to use
this opportunity to try to make Dr. King's dream a reality.''
   Fama's defense lawyer, David DePetris, blamed the verdict on
Owens' instructions to the jury, which he called ``substantially
one-sided.'' He said he planned an appeal.
   Fama's family retreated to a third-floor corridor, refusing to
speak to reporters. Fama was led away in handcuffs and returned to
the Brooklyn House of Detention, where he has been held since a
week after the murder.
   The Hawkins family and friends, holding hands with their
adviser, the Rev. Al Sharpton, quietly walked out of the courtroom.
Outside, Stewart raised a clenched fist to the croud of about 150
supporters, who shouted ``Yusuf! Yusuf!''
   ``This is a victory for the people,'' said Dave Walker, an
investigator for a Brooklyn civil rights group. ``The tension's
high throughout the city, throughout the whole country. ... All
communities needed the verdict.''
   Fama's Bensonhurst neighbors were defensive.
   ``He was a good boy. I've known him 20 years,'' said Fama's
next-door neighbor, a woman who refused to be identified. ``We all
felt sad that the kid died. But they didn't have enough evidence.''
   Prosecutors allege Mondello assembled a gang from the
neighborhood because he was afraid that black and Hispanic friends
of a young neighborhood woman, Gina Feliciano, were coming to beat
him up.

<TEXT>
   In another case of TV going back to the future,
``Candid Camera,'' which began in 1948 and has been a series on all
three networks, will be back next September.
   The show's return as a syndicated half-hour series was announced
Friday. It comes as the networks are trying to cash in on a craze
started by ABC's ``America's Funniest Home Videos.''
   In fact, Vin Di Bona, executive producer of that series, will
serve in the same capacity for the new ``Candid Camera.'' Allen
Funt, the show's creator and former host, will be a consultant.
   The host will be announced later, said Allyson Kossow, a
spokeswoman for the producer and syndicator, King World.
   The company also syndicates the high-rated ``Wheel of Fortune''
and ``Oprah Winfrey'' shows. It will have two game shows on ABC in
prime time next month _ the first time in 20 years ABC has had
nighttime game shows.
   The long-running premise of Funt's show has been to snoop on
unsuspecting persons with hidden cameras, watching their reactions
to bizarre situations, then reveal all with a cry of ``Smile,
you're on `Candid Camera.' ''
   The new version will include a classic moment from past
versions, King World said.
   CBS has recently broadcast several ``Candid Camera'' specials.
The show had its longest run on that network, which broadcast it as
a half-hour series from 1960 to 1967.
   Funt's co-hosts during the show's CBS run were the late Arthur
Godfrey, announcer Durward Kirby, and Bess Myerson.
   Funt, who produced the 1968 movie ``What Do You Say To A Naked
Lady,'' is working on a feature film that is loosely based on his
life, according to King World.

   A newly empaneled federal grand jury convened
today to continue the 3{-year-old criminal investigation of the
Iran-Contra scandal.
   The grand jury will attempt to determine the precise roles of
President Reagan and then-Vice President Bush in the affair,
sources familiar with the investigation say.
   Associate independent counsel Craig Gillen is spearheading the
newest phase of the Iran-Contra probe. Gillen and two other lawyers
from the office of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh were in the
U.S. Courthouse conducting the first day's work of the grand jury.
No witnesses were called before the panel immediately.
   Mary Belcher, a spokeswoman for the Iran-Contra prosecutor's
office, refused to respond to any questions.
   While the grand jury's work could lead to further indictments in
the affair, one of its central purposes is to gather information
for a final report on the scandal, said the sources, who spoke only
on condition of anonymity.
   Former National Security Council aide Oliver North and former
National Security Adviser John Poindexter may be called as
witnesses before the grand jury at a later date, the sources said.
   Poindexter has not given testimony to the Iran-Contra
prosecutor. North gave testimony at his own criminal trial last
year, but Iran-Contra prosecutors have not had the opportunity to
question the former White House aide extensively about the affair.
   The panel also is expected to examine the activities of other
Reagan administration figures such as Alan Fiers, the former chief
of the CIA's Central American Task Force, and former State
Department official Elliott Abrams, the sources said.
   North worked closely with both Fiers and Abrams.
   Poindexter was convicted of five felonies last month in the
Iran-Contra scandal and faces sentencing June 11. North is
appealing his three felony convictions.
   Sources said last month that Poindexter and North likely would
be granted immunity from prosecution at some point in an effort to
compel their testimony before a new grand jury in connection with
Walsh's probe.
   Gillen is a former assistant U.S. attorney who successfully
prosecuted ex-Congressman Pat Swindall for perjury. Gillen, 38,
worked in the U.S. attorney's office in Atlanta for 11 years.
   Gillen won convictions against the Georgia Republican on charges
of lying to a federal grand jury about an attempt to negotiate an
$850,000 home loan from an undercover agent posing as a money
launderer. Swindall, who is appealing the 1989 convictions, was
sentenced to a year in prison and fined $30,000.

   ``One day we knew they didn't like what we were playing,''
recalled 10th grade trumpet player Sean Latta, one of 80 music
students at the school, 120 miles north of Spokane, Wash.
   ``They make these high shrill noises ... and we were just
waiting for them to blow. When they did, we got out of here as fast
as we could.''
   Jane Fowler, a school district trustee, said skunks aren't the
real problem: ``It's the building. It's a rotten facility.'
   The music room, Lee Hall, was built by students in the early
1970s and is so run down it's not considered worthwhile to replace
the plywood cover along the base.
   That allows the skunks easy access to the space underneath,
where they have settled for the past six years.
   The district wants $10 million to renovate the school and
replace Lee Hall. But the Education Ministry says it's only a
medium-priority item.
   Five skunks have been trapped since fall.
   ``The kids' sandwiches make great bait,'' noted maintenance man
Roger Bond.

<HEAD>Judge Finds Father Guilty in Acid-Poisoning of Baby</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAUKEGAN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge today found a man guilty of
first-degree murder in the sulfuric acid poisoning of his infant
son in what prosecutors said was a scheme to sue a commercial baby
formula manufacturer.
   Ricky Irby Sr., 29, could face the death penalty. Lake County
Associate Judge Harry Hartel, who presided over a two-week,
non-jury trial, set a sentencing hearing for June 29.
   Irby and the child's mother, Sheila Smith, both were charged in
the death of Quinten Irby. The infant, who was 3 months old when he
was force-fed sulfuric acid May 31, 1984, lived for 27 months at
Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago. He died Aug. 26, 1986.
   Ms. Smith already has pleaded guilty in return for a 20- to
65-year prison sentence.
   Irby's attorneys contended that the father had nothing to do
with the crime. Prosecutors contended that the couple poisoned the
baby with the intent of suing a baby formula manufacturer.
   At one point, the case was essentially closed when evidence,
which had been tested by a toxicologist, was discovered missing.
Later, investigators determined that a lab clerical worker
accidentally destroyed the evidence.
   The case was reopened after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in
November 1988 that said evidence lost by accident does not preclude
prosecution.

   The catastrophic eruption of Mount St.
Helens 10 years ago taught scientists and ordinary citizens lessons
that can save lives, geologists told a symposium near the volcano
today.
   ``It caught our attention and the world's attention, and we
learned a great deal,'' said Robert Christiansen, chief of volcano
hazards for the U.S. Geological Survey. ``It raises a lot of
awareness of volcanism.''
   Christiansen told a ``Ten Years Later'' symposium on the
anniversary of the blast that lessons from Mount St. Helens apply
to other volcanos, especially in the Cascade Mountains of the
northwestern United States.
   ``Before Mount St. Helens, volcanos were seen as something from
the dinosaur era, interesting, but something that happened
somewhere else ... it caught everyone by surprise, even the
geologists who work on it,'' Christiansen said.
   ``This is the first time we've had a real laboratory'' in modern
U.S. history to study volcanos, emergency reponse to eruptions and
the rebirth of a blast zone, said Cowlitz County Commissioner Van
Youngquist.
   ``Our entire state is in a better position now ... whether it's
St. Helens or another Cascade volcano'' that erupts, he said.
   Scientists recounted the earthquake pattern before Mount St.
Helens erupted May 18, 1980, with the fury of 2,500 Hiroshima bombs.
   The eruption, which killed 57 people and scarred a once-lush
landscape, still evokes searing memories but the commemoration also
celebrates nature's recovery power.
   About 400 people who participated in the rescue and recovery
operations were expected at a reunion dinner here tonight.
   The southwest Washington hamlet of Toutle is staging a special
edition of its Volcano Daze festival on Saturday and Sunday, hoping
for thousands of visitors.
   U.S. Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash., and other dignitaries planned
to dedicate a $500 million dam Saturday on the north fork of the
Toutle River. The dam is designed to keep 258 million cubic yards
of volcanic sediment from clogging rivers and flooding lowlands.
   The Weyerhaeuser Co., which says it lost $68 million worth of
its trees in the eruption, is giving dignitaries tours to show the
greening of more than 45,000 acres it has replanted.
   Youngquist toured the volcano area by air Thursday.
   ``Going back now, I can never forget what it looked like when I
got a helicopter tour the morning after the eruption.'' he said.
``It was very eerie. A strong sulfur smell from the crater ...
Vehicles with victims in them. It was a shocking feeling one can
never forget.
   ``But there is also a sense of renewal. ... You can see insects
and birds and wildlife.''
   Federal, state and local governments have spent more than $1
billion on rescue, recovery and reconstruction since the blast.
   Officials at the main visitor center at Castle Rock are girding
for a major tourism boom as the slumbering volcano returns to the
front pages and news broadcasts. About 500,000 visitors come each
year. About 50,000 have scaled the 8,363-foot peak since it was
reopened to climbers three years ago.
   Most folks seem to remember precisely where they were on that
quiet Sunday morning when the mountain erupted. A few months after
waking from a century-long slumber, the mountain blew its top at
8:32 a.m. on May 18, 1980.
   With the energy of a nuclear warhead of as much as 50 megatons,
the eruption ripped off 1,315 feet of the previously cone-shaped
peak.
   The eruption sent ash plumes miles into the atmosphere and ash
clouds turned day into night in eastern Washington. The blast
devastated more than 230 square miles in a fan-shaped swath north
and northwest of the volcano.
   Although part of the new 110,000-acre National Volcanic Monument
looks like a lunar landscape, life is returning. Some trees planted
after the eruption are 30 feet tall.

<TEXT>
   Japanese magnate Ryoei Saito says van Gogh's
``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' cost about $33 million more than he had
expected, but it did not rattle him. He already had another huge
art buy in mind.
   Saito made art-world waves with his purchase Tuesday of the
haunting van Gogh portrait for $82.5 million, the highest price
ever paid for a painting at auction.
   He followed up Thursday by buying Renoir's ``Au Moulin de la
Galette'' for $78.1 million, the second-highest auction price for a
painting.
   The 74-year-old Saito is one of Japan's wealthiest men, but the
public knows little of his private life.
   Still, the few available glimpses offer some intriguing
contrasts.
   He believes the two paintings are among the most beautiful to be
found anywhere but says they will probably spend several years
locked up in a storeroom before being put on public display.
   He wields immense power as a businessman, but his sons _ not he
_ are formally in charge of his company.
   Art is his passion, but he once sold off a large part of his
collection to help his ailing company.
   And while he is casual now about spending millions in a single
stroke, he resigned the presidency of his company eight years ago
to take personal responsibility for its sagging fortunes.
   Saito said in a rare telephone interview Friday night that he
had long ago set his heart on the two paintings.
   ``Au Moulin de la Galette,'' a shimmering Impressionist canvas,
depicts a sunny garden in Montmartre filled with dancing couples,
the men in black frocks and yellow hats and the women in pink and
blue gowns.
   ``Dr. Gachet,'' is a melancholy portrait of the doctor who
treated the artist in the weeks before his suicide.
   ``They are world-class, wonderful works,'' Saito said.
   Even so, the stratospheric prices stunned participants at spring
auctions in New York this week. Auctioneers had expected the works
would sell for $40 million to $50 million each.
   Before the auctions, Saito reportedly told his representative,
gallery owner Hideto Kobayashi, that no price was too high to pay.
But he told newspaper reporters after buying the Van Gogh: ``It
cost 5 billion yen ($33 million) more than I expected, but that's
nothing.''
   Saito's nonchalance about the price paid for the paintings may
not sit well with Japanese government officials and business
leaders, who are calling on compatriots to keep a lower profile
when it comes to big buys overseas.
   The Japanese were worried by American reactions to Sony's
purchase of Colombia Pictures and Mitsubishi Estate's buy of part
of Rockefeller Plaza in New York City. They feared such purchases
could provoke an anti-Japanese backlash.
   But Saito is far from shy about displaying his wealth. He said
official fears of how high-rolling Japanese are viewed would not
affect his purchasing plans.
   ``I'm not concerned. Because this is all one big world,'' he
said.
   Saito, chairman emeritus of Japan's second-biggest paper
company, is often on lists of Japan's wealthiest people. He has
vast holdings in real estate, and his financial assets should be
more than enough to pay for the works, analysts say.
   Saito is the patriarch of a powerful family that controls the
Daishowa Paper Manufacturing Co. He was its president from 1961 to
1982, when he resigned to take responsibility for a business slump
and subsequently sold off much of his art collection to revive the
paper concern.
   Now, he is said to be the company's de facto chief, with two
sons acting as president and chairman. His younger brother is state
governor of Shizuoka prefuecture, where the Saito clan resides and
Daishowa has one of its corporate headquarters.
   By the late 1980s, the business had revived sufficiently to
allow Saito to move into collecting circles again. But he says he
owns only a few artworks, including a Chagall and an Andrew Wyeth
painting.
   Although he plans to keep the paintings under wraps initially,
Saito promises they will someday be on public view _ perhaps, he
says, in New York's Metropolitan Museum. Or perhaps in a small
museum in his home prefecture.

<HEAD>Head Start Called an American Success Story</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The popular Head Start preschool program
celebrated its 25th anniversary Friday with officials saying they
were closer than ever to their dreams of obtaining full federal
funding.
   Head Start ``is an American success story for millions of
children,'' said Eugenia Boggus, president of the National Head
Start Association, which released a report marking the program's
anniversary.
   ``It is time that this very successful program receive the
financial support it needs to ensure quality and to serve all
eligible children,'' Ms. Boggus said.
   The report called for full funding for the program, with some of
the money earmarked for staff training, increased wages,
transportation and maintenance of facilities.
   Head Start was signed into existence by President Lyndon Johnson
to provide education, meals and health screening for youngsters
aged 3 through 5.
   Over the years, more than 11 million children and their families
have received Head Start services in all 50 states, the District of
Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Pacific
Territories.
   Ms. Boggus said two of her seven children, now ranging in age
from 12 to 25, had been enrolled in Head Start and the difference
between those who attended and those who did not was remarkable.
She said the Head Start enrollees entered regular public school
with positive self-esteem and confidence. Her daughter, now in the
fifth grade, is a top student and well-adjusted socially, she said.
   Sharon Kagan, director of a child development center at Yale
University and a member of Head Start's Silver Ribbon Panel, said
there are about 2 million eligible children ages 3-5 who need Head
Start, yet the program only serves 450,000 children in that age
group.
   The House passed a bill Wednesday that would expand Head Start
five-fold over the next four years to include all eligible
children. The legislation, passed 404-14 and sent to the Senate,
would authorize up to $2.4 billion for Head Start in the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1. That's $1 billion more than the current
year's spending level.
   ``We feel very positive about it,'' project director Joan
Lombardi said of the legislation but acknowledged that
authorization of funding does not mean Congress will actually
appropriate the money.
   She said Head Start programs have a harder time recruiting and
retaining qualified staff due to low wages, and need to serve an
increasing number of multi-problem families. In addition, costs of
facilities, transportation and other non-personnel items are
escalating.
   Additional funding also is critically needed to allow local
programs to provide full-day services, she said. As more and more
Head Start parents are working, full-day Head Start programs become
essential, the report said.
   Only 15 percent of Head Start programs are full-day.
   ``The percentage of children in poverty has escalated and the
problems of poor children today are more complex than those of a
quarter-century ago _ more and more children must deal with
problems of drugs and violence in their communities and with
homelessness, child abuse, and teen-age parenthood,'' said Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
   ``For millions of these children, Head Start is their best hope
for the future.''

   Thousands of anti-government
demonstrators rampaged through downtown streets Friday, burning
tires and hurling rocks at police on the 10th anniversary of the
nation's bloodiest uprising.
   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!'' the crowd screamed, waving red,
yellow and blue banners. ``Yankee go home!'' they shouted in an
outpouring of rage against President Roh and the U.S. military
forces stationed in South Korea.
   Nationwide, about 70,000 police were deployed in a show of force
to prevent violence, officials said. In Seoul, about 12,000 riot
police guarded government offices, public buildings and foreign
legations.
   The violence erupted after some 100,000 people rallied downtown
to mark the May 18, 1980, pro-democracy uprising in this provincial
city, which seared the pysche of Koreans more than any incident
since the 1950 Korean War.
   Kwangju police reported arrests and injuries Friday but gave no
details. One man with blood over his face was rushed to a hospital
in an ambulance.
   A three-hour nighttime rally began peacefully. People demanded
the ouster of the Roh government and the 43,000 American troops in
South Korea under a mutual defense treaty.
   Roh, a former army general, is extremely unpopular in Kwangju
because of his alleged role in crushing the 1980 revolt militarily.
He was a key member of the then-martial-law government that quelled
it.
   That uprising began when hundreds of thousands of citizens rose
up against the central government to protest a crackdown on
political dissent. Protesters drove out police and took control of
the city for 10 days before being crushed by tank-led paratroopers.
   By official count, about 200 people were killed and more than
1,700 others injured or wounded. Kwangju citizens claim the death
toll was much higher.
   Anti-U.S. sentiment is also strong among Kwangju citizens
because many believe Washington condoned the ruthless crushing of
the revolt.
   After the initial nighttime rally, about 7,000 people marched
along downtown streets, shouting anti-government and anti-U.S.
slogans. When blocked by squads of riot police near a district head
office of Roh's ruling party, protests turned violent.
   Protesters broke sidewalks into fist-sized rocks and threw them
at riot police, who responded with barrages of tear gas. Onlookers,
gagged by the choking tear gas, rushed for cover.
   Demonstrators piled dozens of tires on several intersections and
set them ablaze. Belching smoke billowed over much of the city
center.
   Elsewhere in the city, groups of protesters ranging from 500 to
2,000 clashed with riot police, hurling rocks. Some protesters
broke telephone booths and ripped apart street signs. No firebombs
were used.
   In several encounters, police were outnumbered by swarms of
protesters hurling hundreds of rocks at a time. Some police were
overpowered by demonstrators and beaten.
   The clashes continued for more than two hours until after
midnight.
   In Seoul, about 2,000 students hurling rocks and firebombs
fought riot police in scattered street battles. About 500 students
were arrested in a preventive police move against violence but most
were released later.
   ``Disband the DLP!'' students shouted, referring to Roh's ruling
Democratic Liberal Party, formed early this year in a controversial
political merger involving two opposition groups.
   The rallies in Kwangju followed a memorial ceremony at
Mangwoldong Cemetery, a hillside graveyard where victims of the
revolt are buried. Thousands braved downpours to offer prayers to
the memory of the victims and burn an effigy of Roh clad in a
military uniform.
   ``My child, my child,'' cried an old woman in white mourning
clothes, rubbing a gray tombstone bearing the name of her 17-year
daughter killed in the revolt.
   A few yards away, about 20 youths placed a bundle of yellow
flowers in front of a tomb and made deep bows, one by one. They
sang anti-government songs and shouted, ``Remember Kwangju!'' and
``Fight for democracy!''
   Down the hill, hundreds of weeping mourners, many wearing white
funeral clothing, held umbrellas and walked to the graveyard along
muddy fields.

   The National Council of Churches voted to mark
the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' landing in the
Americas, while calling it an invasion that led to genocide.
   ``American people have so digested the myth on American history
that they have lost sight of the truth _ the pain of so many people
who live on the continent,'' said the Rev. George Tinker, an Osage
Indian.
   The council's policy-setting board late Thursday decided to
recognize the anniversary in a resolution that was a compromise
between those who wanted to celebrate it and those who see it as an
occasion to reflect on past wrongs. The board approved several
amendments denouncing slavery and the mistreatment of Indians since
Columbus' fleet reached Caribbean islands in 1492.
   One amendment approved by the board called on publishers to
incorporate historical instances of mistreatment of blacks and
Indians into school textbooks.
   However, it voted down a move to add a suggested reading list to
the council's resolution.
   ``Many of us find it hard to state this is not a time for
celebration,'' Episcopalian Bishop David Reed told about 250 board
members. ``There are many things over the past 500 years to thank
God for.''
   The council, representing 32 denominations with 42 million
members, comprises most Anglican, Orthodox and Protestant
denominations.
   The council also heard a proposed statement on domestic violence
from its Commission on Family Ministries and Human Sexuality.
   The statement calls on church leaders to name family violence as
a sin and refer abuse victims to police and human-services agencies.
   ``We urge the church to confess its complicity in this
problem,'' said the Rev. Marie Fortune.
   The council's final vote on the resolution is scheduled for its
November meeting in Portland, Ore.

   While the two German leaders were signing a
high-stakes economic treaty, East Germans who are gambling their
future on its success got their first casino Friday.
   West German bankers opened the doors to a flashy gaming house
complete with a pricey drink list, jackets-only dress code, 30 slot
machines, and a clutch of gaming tables lined with blue velour.
   The pocket of glitz in this working-class country is perched on
the 38th floor of the luxury Hotel Stadt Berlin, which overlooks
East Berlin's main square, Alexanderplatz.
   The casino is the first in the country, the product of a joint
venture between the government hotel chain and a subsidiary of the
West German Landesbank.
   It represents not only the Western investment that already is
moving into the former socialist nation, but the wide economic gulf
that separates East Germans from their wealthy Western neighbors.
   ``Eighty-five percent of the people will be denied this thing,''
Michael Feistkorn, a bartender at the Hotel Stadt Berlin, said of
the casino.
   A cola at the casino will cost $3.
   Winfried Hollenberg, an official with the Landesbank subsidiary
Westdeutschen Spielbank, acknowledged that foreigners and tourists
also were being targeted by the casino.
   ``We fear that in the coming time, the great want of the East
German citizens may not be gambling,'' he said.
   The casino was opened the same day the two German leaders signed
an economic agreement in Bonn, West Germany. The pact will merge
the economies of the two nations July 2, when the West German mark
will become the currency of East Germany.
   But it leaves vague many areas of East Germany's shift from a
planned socialist economy to the free market. Uncertainty over the
future and the threat of widespread unemployment in East Germany
has triggered a wave of labor unrest.
   East Germans, who will still only make about a third of their
West German neighbors in average salary, also fear higher prices
set by the free market.
   Karl-Heinz Bringer, manager of Westdeutschen Spielbank, said the
casino exists only for amusement.
   He said he expects it to bring in about $600,000 a year, 80
percent of which will go into the city to finance social and
environmental programs.
   Casino officials say they hope to move the relatively small
gaming house to its own, larger quarters on Leipziger Street, the
now-grim avenue that runs parallel to the remains of the Berlin
Wall.
   Eventually, casinos will be opened in the industrial towns of
Leipzig, Dresden, Erfurt, Rostock, Magdeburg und Karl-Marx-Stadt,
backers said.
   The Landesbank subsidiary owns 49 percent of the operation and
the newly formed East German Casino Corp. owns the rest.
   The East Berlin casino will have 26 croupiers, all West Germans.
   East Germans are to be added later after they are trained to run
roulette wheels and deal blackjack.

   A powerful bomb hidden near a movie
theater in one of the city's most congested districts exploded
Friday as a show was letting out, killing 10 people and injuring at
least 54, police said.
   The blast occurred at 7 p.m. as a crowd of people left the
theater, officers reported. They said it was hidden in a box placed
under a nearby bench.
   At least 10 of the injured were reported in critical condition.
   No one claimed responsibility for the blast, the second in as
many weeks to rock this ancient city. Authorities suggested that
agents working for the government of neighboring India might be
involved.
   Lahore, the provincial capital of Punjab, is about 10 miles from
the border with India. New Delhi blames Pakistan for two violent
secessionist movements in the Indian states of Punjab and
Jammu-Kashmir.
   Pakistan's Urdu-language newspapers have suggested India might
be involved in a recent rash of bombings in Lahore and in the
cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
   Hundreds of bombs have exploded in Pakistan's cities and
villages in recent years. Most have occurred in the Northwest
Frontiner Province and are routinely blamed on agents of the
Soviet-backed government in Afghanistan, where rebels backed by
Pakistan are fighting the leadership.
   India, which is predominantly Hindu, and Pakistan, a Moslem
nation, have been uneasy neighbors since their creation in the 1947
partition of the subcontinent.
   They went to war in 1948 and 1965 over the former princely state
of Kashmir. They fought a third war in 1971 that lead to the
creation of Bangladesh from what was once East Pakistan.
   Their leaders have exchanged heated accusations and vitriolic
warnings with the escalating violence in India-held Kashmir. More
than 300 people have been killed since Indian troops launched a
crackdown on Jan. 20 on Moslem militants who are demanding
independence.
   Pakistan denies Indian allegations that it arms, trains and
harbors the separatists but says it supports the Kashmiris' right
to self-determination.

   Former President Reagan said today that
he will travel to Europe soon ``to see what is left'' of the Berlin
Wall.
   In a speech to 2,073 graduates at Louisiana State University and
about 24,000 other spectators, Reagan also discussed his support
for the independence movement of the Soviet Union's Baltic states.
   ``I celebrate their bravery,'' Reagan said. ``The captive
nations of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were invaded by the Soviet
Union. They have been held against their will since 1940 when
Hitler and Stalin made a pact. No pact made by Hitler and Stalin
should prevail today. The Baltic countries and their peoples should
be free.''
   Reagan said he and his wife, Nancy, would travel to Poland and
France as well as Berlin in a few weeks.
   ``In Poland, I will tell the people that what they have done is
good and right and we are with them.''
   Reagan said he would visit Normandy, the site of the major
Allied invasion of World War II, where ``as much as anywhere in the
world, freedom triumphed.''
   The former president said Cuba ``is next in democracy's sweep.''
   ``And let me say directly to Fidel Castro _ like Honecker in
East Germany, like Ceaucescu in Romania, like Noriega in Panama,
like all the other has-been dictators of despair, you cannot fight
democracy's destiny. Fidel, you're finished,'' Reagan said.
   Among the graduates was Roberto Greene, the stepson of
Panamanian Vice President Guillermo Ford. Greene received a
bachelor's degree in marketing.
   In brief remarks, Ford thanked Reagan for his foreign policy
decisions.
   ``It is indeed a great honor to be here today representing a
free country, thanks to the vision of President Reagan who started
a democratic movement in all of Latin America,'' he said.
   Ford also praised President Bush's decision last year to send
troops to Panama to oust Gen. Manuel Noriega, now awaiting trial in
Florida on federal drug charges.
   ``It was not an invasion. It was a liberation,'' Ford said.

   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, quoted the unidentified
head of the Defense Ministry's industrial section as saying that 60
percent of its resources will be used in public projects. He said
this includes electronics, communications and computers, plus the

   The State Department revived charges Friday
that Romania's ruling party has used violence and intimidation
against opposition groups during the campaign for Sunday's national
elections.
   ``Serious concerns have been raised about how free and fair the
electoral process has actually been,'' said deputy spokesman
Richard Boucher.
   The Bush administration, he said, would hold the Romanian
government responsible for an honest election.
   The National Salvation Front assumed power in December after
President Nicolae Ceausescu was ousted and executed. Ion Iliescu,
leader of the Front, is heavily favored to win the election.
   Boucher acknowledged that Iliescu and the Front ``have been
credited with beginning the process of democratization and economic
reform and with expanding freedom of expression, religion and
travel.''
   But he said the administration shares many of the concerns that
have prompted demonstrations in Bucharest and elsewhere in recent
days.
   Boucher made no specific reference to a demand of many Romanian
students that would bar former Communist Party members from
politics for six years. Most of the Front leadership falls into
that category, including Iliescu, who broke with Ceausescu 20 years
ago.
   Boucher said concerns about the campaign include ``organized
acts of intimidation and violence directed primarily against
opposition candidates and parties, especially the National Liberal
Party and the National Peasant Party, which are the two principal
opponents of the Front.''
   He said the concerns also include an imbalance of campaign
resources that favors the ruling party and discrimination in media
access against opposition candidates.
   The administration signaled its concern over the Romanian
process last week by recalling Ambassador Alan Green to Washington
for consultations. He has returned to Bucharest for the elections.
   Gov. Garrey Carruthers, R-N.M., will head a U.S. delegation
appointed by President Bush to observe the elections.

<HEAD>Inspired by WWII German POW Camp, Students Write Historical Novel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MIMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FARR WEST, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When ninth-graders learned that a World
War II POW camp once stood across the street from their school,
they knew they had found the right topic for a class writing
project.
   But Jeff Stephens' class never guessed when they began
researching and writing a historical novel that they would share
the bittersweet memories of an old German soldier _ and mourn his
comrades, slain by a crazed American guard.
   ``I thought we were just going to write a book. But we found out
we have history right here that we didn't know about,'' said Corey
Slater, one of the 28 English students at Wahlquist Junior High who
collaborated on ``German Brothers in a Foreign Land.''
   The 103-page novel is based on the experiences of Herbert
Barkhoff, a German soldier who spent more than two years in U.S.
prisoner of war camps after being captured in 1943.
   Barkhoff came here to Camp Ogden shortly after he was wounded by
an Army private who machine-gunned Germans as they slept in their
tents at the Salina POW camp, 160 miles to the south. In all, nine
Germans were killed and 19 wounded in the attack July 8, 1945.
   The attacker, Pvt. Clarence Bertucci, was declared insane and
committed to an asylum. He died in 1969.
   The students wrote of the massacre from the viewpoint of
Barkhoff.
   Stephens got the idea of having his class write a book from a
fellow teacher while attending a writing conference last summer.
The class received the assignment in September _ to create a
historical novel based on a local historical event of national or
global significance.
   Within a few weeks, one student recounted her grandparents'
story about a German POW camp in the area.
   From research in books, old newspaper clippings, college
historical collections and military records, they learned that the
county fairgrounds across the street from their school once held
4,500 Axis prisoners in a barbed-wire compound.
   Kent Powell of the Utah Historical Society, who has written a
non-fiction book on German POWs in Utah, suggested Barkhoff as a
literary focal point.
   The class put Barkhoff's story in the form of a novel, complete
with reconstructed dialogue. In addition to their other research,
the pupils used letters and journals provided by Barkhoff and
translated by a German teacher.
   ``Most Germans didn't want to be here, but they looked to
America as a chance to live and learn,'' the students wrote.
   ``I didn't write one word of it,'' Stephens told 100 parents and
teachers Thursday at a celebration of the printing of the novel.
His students proved that ``where magic is allowed for, magic will
occur,'' he said.
   ``It far, far and away exceeded my hopes,'' Stephens said.
   Barkhoff, now 70, recently suffered a stroke and could not
attend, but the class signed a copy of the book to be delivered to
his home in Hollingen, West Germany. He sent word he was ``very
touched and honored'' to have been selected for the book. Other
copies _ 200 were printed _ are being distributed to the students,
parents and other teachers.
   Paul Wollborm, Barkhoff's neighbor, represented him at the
celebration. Speaking through an interpreter, Wollborm said the
book is an indication of continuing close relations between a
resurgent, reunifying Germany and America.
   ``I was amazed you selected such a theme,'' he said. ``I hope
the friendship between the United States and Germany continues to
deepen.''
   It is a feeling shared by the writers, who say their novel
taught them about the folly and horror of war.
   At one point, Stephens' class visited a Salt Lake City cemetery
where the nine Germans slain at Salina are buried. Some wept at the
simple tombstones.
   ``It made us feel bad that the Germans were treated bad over
here, even though they treated our guys bad, too,'' said Alex Wood.
``I felt remorse. There's history right next door and no one knew.''
   Alex's classmate Joie Hill said the project, and especially the
cemetery visit, made the past startlingly real.
   ``The Germans were just like us. They had their feelings,'' she
said. ``But I wouldn't call them Germans _ I would call them our
friends.''

<TEXT>
   Police on Friday barred protesting
students from the National Assembly building, where deputies were
debating limits on universities' academic and administrative
freedom.
   The unrest comes on the heels of a strike by public employees
and is the latest problem to plague the 3-week-old government of
President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.
   The government claims current law gives the universities too
much independence, and it wants to change it.
   About 500 college students blocked off two avenues by the
assembly building, popping firecrackers, chanting anti-government
slogans and demanding the law be allowed to stand.
   Police in riot gear stopped the students from entering the
government complex grounds.
   Mrs. Chamorro has asked the National Assembly to temporarily
suspend the elections of officials at Nicaragua's four state
universities while deputies revise the autonomy law. Elections are
set for next week.
   During their 10{-year rule, the Sandinistas appointed state
university officials. They said if the universities had autonomy,
conservatives would entrench themselves and have too much influence.
   But after losing the Feb. 25 elections to Mrs. Chamorro, who
took over April 25, the Sandinistas hurriedly passed the autons in the
elections.
   Government officials accused the Sandinistas of engineering the
strikes to destabilize the government.
   Mrs. Chamorro is trying to cope with an array of problems,
including prices sent soaring by devaluations of the national
currency, the cordoba.
   Workers at state sugar mills threatened to strike unless they
get a 160 percent pay raise.
   The United States recently lifted an economic embargo imposed in
1985 against the Sandinista govenment and began importing
Nicaraguan sugar. The sugar is being purchased at preferential
prices under a quota system designed to benefit some Third World
sugar producers.

   Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam
Nunn and Sen. John Glenn have asked for an independent
investigation of complaints about the way the U.S. Naval Academy
dealt with midshipmen who handcuffed a female student to a urinal.
   Rear Adm. Virgil L. Hill Jr., superintendent of the academy at
Annapolis, Md., already has ordered special inquiries into the
widely publicized incident.
   In a joint letter to Comptroller General Charles Bowsher, the
two senators asked the General Accounting Office, which Bowsher
heads, to expand a review already underway to include how well the
service academies are being managed.
   The senators said they were concerned about the Naval Academy's
response to the hazing incident as well as ``irregularities in the
processing of ...certain disciplinary cases'' and a break-in at the
engineering department and possible theft of final examinations.
   ``Together, these incidents suggest the possibility of problems
at the Naval Academy and insensitivity by its leadership with
regard to academic integrity, the overall treatment of women and
fairness in disciplinary proceedings,'' wrote Nunn, a Georgia
Democrat, and Glenn, an Ohio Democrat.
   Glenn, chairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Manpower
and Personnel, released the letter Friday.
   Gwen Dreyer, 19, recently resigned from the academy, saying she
was frustrated by the way officials handled the investigation of
her complaint that two male midshipmen handcuffed her to a urinal
and taunted her as others snapped pictures.
   The academy ruled that the assault wasn't premeditated and
therefore couldn't be considered hazing.
   Two midshipmen received one-month campus restrictions and
demerits on their records after an academy hearing. Six others
received written warnings.
   Dreyer, the daughter and granddaughter of academy graduates, has
said she now plans to study engineering at California State
Polytechnic Institute.
   On Thursday, Sen. Richard Shelby, D-Ala., asked Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney and Navy Secretary Lawrence Garrett III to
``make all efforts to determine whether there is an institutional
bias against women in the service academies.''

<TEXT>
   For more than four decades, the bitter
memories of war and defeat clung to Emperor Hirohito. That same
ghost now haunts his son, Emperor Akihito, who on Friday paid
tribute to Nagasaki's atomic bomb victims.
   About 3,800 people stood in steady rain as Akihito, accompanied
by Empress Michiko, became the first monarch to remember the
devastating Aug. 9, 1945 attack at a monument to its 70,000 victims.
   The emperor bowed and placed a bouquet of white flowers on a
dark granite cenotaph before the Peace Park monument.
   The royal couple was greeted by loud yells of ``Banzai'' _ a
wish for long life _ when they arrived for the ceremony. And as
they left, some in the crowd sang ``Kimi Ga Yo,'' Japan's
unofficial national anthem.
   The emperor and empress later visited a hospital for patients
suffering from illness related to the bombing.
   In a statement, Akihito said that seeing the park and hospital
``renewed my thoughts for peace ... and prayers for those who still
are in pain because of the bomb's effects.''
   In Nagasaki, that pain runs deep.
   ``I think he has helped heal some of the wounds by coming,''
said store clerk Sachiko Nagata, who was seven years old when the
bomb was dropped and now suffers from radiation sickness.
   ``But it took too long for him to come to this park,'' she said.
   Though the late Hirohito visited Nagasaki for a sporting event
in 1969, his son, Akihito, is the first emperor to present flowers
at the Peace Park memorial.
   Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima was the emperor's guide on the first of
his four-day visit to southern Kyushu Island. Motoshima was shot in
January by an ultra-rightist for saying Hirohito bore some
responsibilty for the war.
   Motoshima made the comment at a city assembly meeting in
December 1988, as Hirohito lay dying of the cancer that ended his
life one month later.
   The mayor also said Hirohito could have helped end the war
sooner and saved Nagasaki from the atomic bomb. Japan surrendered
six days after the attack.
   Though many Japanese share Motoshima's opinions, his candor
angered ultra-rightist groups. For more than a year, he received
death threats.
   Since the shooting, Motoshima has become a symbol of freedom of
speech.
   Though the mayor described Akihito as a ``wonderful human
being,'' he also said the monarch should strive to understand and
heal the wounds of the past.
   ``I hope the new emperor will reflect on why that war occured,
and use his position to further peace,'' Motoshima said Friday.
   Akihito's freedom to publicly reflect on the war will be tested
three days after his visit to Nagasaki ends, when he is to meet
South Korean President Roh Tae-woo in Tokyo.
   The question of how, or even if, Akihito should apologize for
Japan's colonization of Korea from 1911 to the end of World War II
has become a major political issue between the neighbors.
   Though Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has said he plans to
apologize as the elected representative of the Japanese people,
several South Korean officials have reportedly demanded Akihito
make the apology.
   But many Japanese officials say such a ``political'' statement
by the emperor would violate the spirit of Japan's constitution,
which they say aims to limit imperial power by keeping the emperor
off the political stage.

   Something caused a black Emory University
freshman to wad her body into a tight knot and not speak to anyone,
even her own family, for days.
   Her family said Sabrina Collins had been the victim of a
month-long campaign of racist threats and vandalism in her
dormitory room, news that set off a debate over race relations at
the private university. But by the time Ms. Collins broke her
silence, she said investigators were trying to prove she staged
everything.
   The 19-year-old pre-medical student said she sees little chance
the mystery will be solved. She said she hopes investigators will
close the case.
   ``That still doesn't make me feel good because that means there
is still somebody out there who did this to me who got off
scot-free,'' she told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week.
``I have been punished for being the victim.''
   After two weeks in a hospital, Ms. Collins has retreated to her
home in Hephzibah in east Georgia. Her attorney, Bensonetta Tipton
Lane, said Ms. Collins did not want to be interviewed this week.
   Back in Atlanta, Emory officials have said nothing critical of
Ms. Collins, a dean's list student and the only black member of the
soccer team. Some students wore white armbands to show support for
her at Monday's commencement exercises.
   ``Until I see some hard evidence that Sabrina Collins is the
perpetrator, I'm going to stick with Sabrina,'' said state Rep.
Tyrone Brooks, a civil rights activist who has advised Emory
student leaders in the matter. ``We're going to continue to offer
her our support. But if it's proven down the road that Sabrina is
the one who did this, I would urge that Sabrina be prosecuted.''
   Ms. Collins was hospitalized after she collapsed and became mute
April 10. Her family said she had lifted a rug in her room and
found the words ``die nigger die'' scribbled in nail polish on the
floor.
   Ms. Collins earlier had reported incidents in which pictures
were broken, bleach was poured on some of her clothes, stuffed
animals were mutilated and the phrase ``nigger, hang'' was found
written on the wall in her closet.
   Emory police first said they couldn't understand how the
incidents continued after they installed an alarm in Ms. Collins'
room. They later theorized that someone had entered the room only
once, concealing some of the vandalism so it would be discovered
later.
   But Ms. Collins told the Atlanta newspaper that the Georgia
Bureau of Investigation wants to implicate her so the case can be
quietly closed.
   She denied that she staged the attacks in order to have an
excuse to leave Emory, the only college to which she applied.
   ``I have nothing, had nothing, to gain in doing this,'' she
said. ``I had everything to lose.''
   GBI spokesman John Bankhead would not comment on the case.
   At the time Ms. Collins was hospitalized, some students held
silent protests and group meetings, saying racism is a time-honored
tradition at the serene college, where 7 percent of the 9,500
students are black.
   In response, Emory President James T. Laney came up with an
extensive plan to create a support center for black students, and
develop programs to encourage faculty members to include more black
perspectives in their teaching.
   School officials also continue to look for leads in the case,
said Emory spokeswoman Jan Gleason. And Laney is planning a summer
retreat to pull together funding for the minority programs, she
said.
   Ms. Collins' teachers sent coursework so she could finish the
semester, but she said she likely will leave Georgia to finish
college.
   ``I feel so sorry for her,'' Brooks said. ``I hope she stays at
Emory ... and not go off to some Northern university and encounter
the same thing. You can't run and hide from racism.''

   The two Germanys on Friday signed a
historic treaty that will bind them into a single economic entity
in less than seven weeks and all but formally end their four-decade
separation.
   The treaty will also plunge fragile East Germany into the rigors
of capitalism starting July 2. Many East Germans fear unemployment
and price increases could be the immediate result.
   For the first time, the two German governments convened in a
single room, witnesses to an event that in many ways will finally
end their separation.
   ``What we are living through here is the birth of a free and
united Germany,'' said Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has aspirations
of becoming reunited Germany's first leader.
   ``This is a historic hour in the life of the German nation,''
said the West German leader, addressing members of both his Cabinet
and that of East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere.
   Nonetheless, formal unification cannot occur until the thorny
question of a united Germany's military allegiance is settled. The
Soviet Union flatly rejects NATO membership for the united country,
while the United States says the German nation should belong to the
Western alliance.
   Kohl has hinted he hopes full political unification will come in
all-German elections at the end of the year.
   Despite Kohl's jubilation, German enthusiasm over the so-called
``state treaty'' was not unanimous.
   West Germany's leftist Greens party boycotted the ceremony at
the government's opulent Palais Schaumburg, charging the treaty
will leave East Germans more impoverished than they already are.
   ``We don't want to be dazed spectators of this consummation of
subjugation,'' the Greens said in a statement.
   Neues Forum, the East German activist organization that started
the fall revolution that ended four decades of hard-line Communist
leadership, had a similar assessment.
   ``Sacrificing all sovereignty, the GDR (East German) government
bows to the will of the victors in Bonn, whose power will triumph
in a future Germany over the dignity and interests of the GDR
populace,'' Neues Forum said.
   Hans-Jochen Vogel, head of West Germany's main opposition Social
Democratic Party, said the treaty on economic merger ``leaves open
a whole series of questions.''
   Vogel said it is still unclear, for example, how East
German-made products can be protected from competition by
better-made goods from West Germany.
   But the East German government has opted for annexation by West
Germany's own powerful economy as preferable to possible economic
collapse.
   Flanked by Kohl and de Maiziere, the finance ministers of the
two nations signed the treaty, under which East Germany's economy
and social structure will be absorbed by West Germany's.
   ``Before the eyes of the world,'' Kohl said, the leaders of two
freely elected German governments were declaring their wish to
build their joint future ``as one people, one nation, in one free
and democratic state.''
   Under the treaty, West Germany's deutsche mark will become East
Germany's own legal tender. All monetary affairs will be controlled
by West Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank.
   West Germany's pension system will be introduced in East Germany
and Bonn will assume responsibility for East German unemployment
benefits.
   East Germany will be required to start selling state property to
help cover reconstruction costs. It will adopt West German
monetary, economic and tax policies on its road to a free-market
economy.
   On Wednesday, West Germany unveiled a $70 billion German Unity
Fund to be used in the East German reconstruction effort. Costs of
the fund will be covered by borrowing and savings in West Germany's
federal budget.
   De Maiziere said not all ``flowery dreams'' of East Germans will
be fulfilled with the treaty. ``But no one will be worse off than
before.''
   Many East Germans fear the economic overhaul will result in huge
unemployment and price increases as subsidies are eliminated. And
there are West German worries they will have to bear awesome
unification costs.
   The weekly news magazine Der Spiegel reported last week that the
East German government had asked Bonn for extra riot gear in case
disturbances erupt.
   Friday's treaty-signing ceremony, attended by about 60
government officials from both Germanys, was loaded with symbolism.
   West German Finance Minister Theodor Waigel and his East German
counterpart, Walter Romberg, signed the treaty at the writing desk
of Konrad Adenauer, West Germany's first chancellor. Adenauer
helped guide the nation from postwar ruins to affluence and its
place in the Western alliance.
   On one wall of the room was a tapestry of Moses, who led his
people across the desert.
   Kohl has made no secret that he would not mind a place in
history next to the revered Adenauer _ as the architect of a
reunited Germany.
   The treaty between East and West Germany is Kohl's greatest
achievement so far. It comes just two months after East Germany's
first free elections, and a little more than six months after the
opening of the Berlin Wall.

<HEAD>U.S., Philippine Officials Agree to Continue Talks</HEAD>

   Negotiators agreed Friday to continue
talks on the future of U.S. military bases after Filipino delegates
accepted American promises to work for increased aid to their
country.
   The chief U.S. delegate complained that first-stage talks with
President Corazon Aquino's government were too concerned with
monetary issues and urged Filipinos to ask themselves whether the
six bases were important to their nation.
   More than 100 people have been arrested in a series of
anti-bases demonstrations in Manila since the talks began.
   Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus, the chief Philippine delegate,
announced the decision to continue negotiations at the end of five
days of exploratory talks on extending the lease beyond its Sept.
16, 1991, expiration. The lease covers the Subic Bay Naval Base,
Clark Air Base and four smaller U.S.-run installations.
   ``The two panels have decided to move on to discussions of the
nature of U.S.-Philippine relations in the future,'' the two sides
said in a joint statement.
   ``These discussions could include consideration of a new
agreement concerning friendship, cooperation and security on the
basis of a new relationship between the Philippines and the U.S. in
the light of the changing global environment.''
   No date was announced for further talks. U.S. panel spokesman
Stanley Schrager said the United States hoped to resume talks ``the
sooner the better.''
   The two governments agreed to continue despite differences over
whether the United States failed to make full aid payments for use
of the bases, and when the facilities would actually have to close
if no new agreement can be reached.
   Philippine authorities claimed the United States owed nearly
$222.6 million in back payments for use of the bases.
   In 1988, the Reagan administration agreed to provide $962
million over two years in return for use of the bases through 1991.
   U.S. officials acknowledged that Congress had cut $96 million
from the Bush administration's aid request for the Philippines but
refused to concede there was any shortfall in payments for the
bases.
   They said the administration had only promised its ``best
efforts'' to meet the aid target.
   Manglapus said the U.S. panel agreed to work for more aid,
including medical equipment, military supplies and food. He said
the pledge was ``sufficient to enter into discussions on future
relations.''
   Richard Armitage, chief U.S. delegate, expressed disappointment
that compensation had dominated the first stage talks. He said
money alone ``cannot cement friendships or confirm friendship of
alliances.''
   ``The future of these bases hinges on how the Filipinos
themselves resolve the following questions: of what value are these
facilities to the Philippines? If the answer is expressed only in
monetary terms, the American military presence cannot be
sustained.''
   The compensation issue reflected the differences between
Washington and Manila in viewing the bases. The United States
maintains the installations are vital for the defense of the
Philippines and the Far East.
   Filipinos, sensing no immediate external threat, view the bases
as a business proposition. Any agreement must be ratified by
two-thirds of the 23-member senate, where opposition is strong.
   In the communique, the two sides agreed that differences in
interpretation of the termination date of the current agreement
``need not stand in the way'' of future negotiations.
   Manila says the lease on the installations expires in September
1991, but the United States says the bases could remain open one
year longer under the current agreement.
   On the eve of the talks, Communist rebels killed two American
airmen near Clark and threatened further attacks on Americans until
all 40,000 U.S. troops, Defense Department civilians and military
dependents leave the Philippines.
   A regional military commander said Friday troops had arrested
three suspected members of the Marxist New People's Army, one of
whom may be involved in the killing of the Americans.
   Early Friday, police said three masked men dressed in black
fired two grenades today from a taxi at a U.S. Information Service
cultural center. Only one grenade exploded, causing minor damage
and no injuries.

   Guests at Toronto's diamond-side SkyDome Hotel
will have to keep their minds on baseball or draw the drapes, the
manager says.
   A couple making love in one of the rooms overlooking the field
in full view of some of the 40,000 Blue Jays fans proved to be a
great publicity boon for one of the city's more unusual hotels.
   But hotel manager Ray Thompson says he runs a respectable place.
   ``We are now going to post some simple rules and regulations in
the rooms,'' Thompson said Friday. ``There also will be an
acknowledgment by the guest that the room in effect becomes part of
the stadium, just as if it were a seat down below.''
   The SkyDome Hotel is part of the domed baseball stadium complex.
It has 348 rooms, 70 of which face the ballpark. Rooms range in
price from $169 to $467. ``That includes tickets to the game _ if
they want to watch the game,'' Thompson said.
   On Tuesday, a woman wrapped in a towel and a naked man watched
the Blue Jays play the Seattle Mariners from the window of their
hotel room.
   Soon, thousands of fans were watching them.
   As the game wore on, the couple apparently wearied of being
spectators and opted for a more participatory sport _ giving new
meaning to ``the seventh inning stretch.''
   The lights were off in the hotel room, but the banks of ballpark
lights revealed all.
   Thompson, for one, doesn't believe the off-field activity was an
accident.
   ``I believe the people, for their own particular reason, wanted
to perform in front of 40,000 people,'' he said.
   Asked if he was angry, Thompson said no.
   ``I wish they'd come back so I could thank them. It certainly
has created a lot of interest in the hotel, and in that room. Many
people want to rent the same room. It has triggered a tremendous
response from people interested in this hotel and its uniqueness.''
   Nonetheless, stern measures must be taken to prevent further
such public displays, he said. As soon as they can be printed up,
documents will be presented to each new guest for signature.
   ``We are going to have people sign a statement that they will
conduct themselves in a proper fashion,'' he said. Failure to do so
could result in expulsion or even criminal charges.
   ``It's just common sense behavior. We can be a traditional
hotel, but the fact that people are sitting below you in the stands
means we can't have people doing things they shouldn't be doing,
and in the public eye.''
   Baseball is, after all, family entertainment.
   ``What if it had been Cap Day?'' Blue Jays President Paul
Beeston was quoted as saying, obviously with tongue firmly
implanted in cheek.
   Thompson said there have been some ``stuffy people who think
it's evil and awful,'' but ``most people definitely have been
looking at it from a humorous point of view. We can't take that
approach because we are responsible hotel operators and have a
responsibility to 40,000 people watching this room. If people want
privacy, all they have to do is draw the drapes.''
   Oh yes, Tuesday night's final score was Mariners 4, Blue Jays 3
in 10 innings. When the teams met again Thursday, some fans looked
to the hotel windows again during the Mariners' 14-6 rout of the
Blue Jays, wondering whether there would be a repeat performance.
   ``Not that anyone really needed an excuse to peek, but by the
time it was 9-0, what else was there to do?'' a local sports
columnist wrote.

<HEAD>NATO Nations Tentatively Agree on How to Share Conventional Arms
Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and its NATO allies
tentatively agreed Friday on a plan for cuts in tanks, artillery
and other weapons expected to be covered in an arms accord later
this year, an alliance source said.
   The plan sets specific figures for five categories of
conventional weapons likely to be limited in Europe as part of an
East-West agreement under negotiation in Vienna, said the NATO
source, who demanded anonymity.
   He refused to reveal the numbers set for each country but
indicated the largest share of cuts would be borne by the United
States.
   ``Obviously, those countries which had the most equipment would
take the most cuts,'' he said.
   The final figures will not be settled on until an agreement is
reached to slash conventional weapons in an area spanning the
Atlantic Ocean to the Ural mountains, deep in the Soviet Union.
   Negotiators for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the
seven nations of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact resumed bargaining
Monday to try to bring both sides to equal ceilings in main battle
tanks, armored combat vehicles, artillery, troops, combat aircraft
and combat helicopters.
   Western officials have in recent weeks complained that Moscow
has slowed progress toward reaching agreement. Still, they are
optimistic a deal can be wrapped up in the fall.
   Among the tough issues still to be resolved are agreeing on a
ceiling for combat aircraft and on verification measures to ensure
compliance with an accord.
   Since late last year, representatives of the NATO nations have
been discussing how to distribute the reductions among themselves.
They used the Western arms proposal as the basis for their work.
   ``There are many elements to (an arms negotiation) and just
accomplishing the treaty doesn't necessarily resolve all issues
...,'' said the NATO source. ``There still remains the allocation
of holdings within that overall ceiling.''
   He suggested ``there might be problems at the end'' if an
overall ceiling were set for NATO but individual nations did not
know the effect on their arsenals.
   To avoid any disputes, he said a special task force of the
alliance nations tentatively agreed not only on specific cuts for
each nation but also on a way to allocate any changes in the final
accord.
   In drawing up the allocation plan, the NATO source said
officials began by working out the overall percentage reduction
that would be required in each category of Western arms.
   Within the overall ceiling, limits have been proposed for
different zones, or groupings of countries. For example, there
would be a cap of 8,000 tanks for NATO countries in Central Europe.
   The source said the officials also took into account the
military requirements of both the alliance and each nation in
coming up with the figures.
   NATO officials also are working on a ``cascading'' plan that
would enable countries to transfer more modern weapons to countries
with older equipment. That way NATO, and presumably the Warsaw
Pact, would get rid of its oldest, not newest arms.
   The West has proposed an overall ceiling of 33,000 artillery
pieces and 60,000 armored combat vehicles. It also has suggested
limits of 9,400 combat aircraft and 3,800 combat helicopters. These
ceilings would be split equally between the two sides.

   Old-fashioned marching orders, backed up by a
$1.8 million buyout, rid St. Paul of its biggest sex-oriented
business. But the unusual porn-fighting tactic backfired on St.
Paul's Twin Cities neighbor.
   ``I don't think anybody thought they would come across the
river,'' said Minneapolis City Councilwoman Jackie Cherryhomes.
   St. Paul Mayor Jim Scheibel thinks his city was the first in the
country to launch a hostile takeover of a porn shop, flexing its
powers of eminent domain and getting the principals to sign a $1.8
million agreement.
   The pact prohibited former Faust Theater operator Jerry Hafiz,
his family and former Faust owner MIC Corp. of Detroit from selling
pornography within city limits.
   ``It's like the sheriff coming out and saying, `You boys have
given us some bad times and if you're not out of town by sunrise,
there's going to be trouble,''' said attorney Leland Frankman, who
represented Faust Theater.
   Hafiz' response was to pack up his peep shows, topless dancing,
porn paraphernalia and other X-rated wares and travel five miles to
Minneapolis.
   The new porn marketplace will be called Deja Vu and was
scheduled to open this summer in the city's trendy warehouse
district.
   ``It worked,'' Scheibel said. ``The fact they are going to
Minneapolis is just a sad fact that pornography is a very
profitable business.''
   Ms. Cherryhomes said she doesn't blame St. Paul, but lamented
the planned porn establishment in her ward.
   ``It just adds to the alienation and the blight,'' she said. ``I
frankly wouldn't wish these businesses onto any community.''
   But she doesn't see Minneapolis trying St. Paul tactics on Deja
Vu.
   ``It takes care of an immediate problem, but it kind of feels
like you're playing hostage,'' she said. ``I don't think people
should be rewarded for those kind of financial dealings.''
   Hafiz, who operated the Faust for more than 20 years before it
was shut down in March 1989, has an unlisted number and in the past
has declined to be interviewed.
   Randall Tigue, the lawyer who helped Hafiz obtain licenses for
Deja Vu, said at least four other adult book stores and five bars
in Minneapolis feature topless dancing, and peep shows can be seen
at several locations in the city.
   In St. Paul, five establishments have licenses permitting
topless dancers and there are a few adult bookstores and other
places offering peep shows, city records show.
   But the Faust had been the biggest porn outlet in the city by
virtue of its diversity. No longer can a business operate peep
shows, dancing, adult books and paraphernalia under the same roof,
Scheibel said.
   Tigue and Frankman said St. Paul abused eminent domain powers to
seize the Faust. They said the theater was operating within the law
and there was no urgent public purpose served by closing it.
   ``I think it's a terrible waste of public funds and I think it
has some serious First Amendment consequences,'' Tigue said. ``If
someone is conveying a message that you don't like, you essentially
pay them to move out of town.

   A Finnish soldier serving with the U.N.
peacekeeping force was wounded Friday by Israeli machine-gun fire
in south Lebanon, a U.N. officer said.
   The officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
soldier was slightly wounded in his right leg when Israeli troops
in the so-called ``security zone'' opened fire on the village of
Taibeh.
   The village is within the zone of operations of the Finnish
battalion of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL. The
soldier was wounded outside his position in the village, the
officer said.
   He refused to identify the wounded soldier pending notification
of his family.
   The officer said the soldier was taken to a field hospital at
UNIFIL headquarters in the border town of Naqoura. He said he did
not know what provoked the shooting.
   The 5,800-member force, drawn from nine nations, mans a narrow
buffer that overlaps with Israel's self-proclaimed security zone.
   Israel established the security zone, about six to 10 miles
deep, after withdrawing the bulk of its forces from south Lebanon
in 1985.
   The strip is patrolled jointly by Israeli troops and allied
militiamen of the South Lebanon Army.

   Jill Ireland, the British actress whose
courageous five-year battle against breast cancer brought hope and
inspiration to the ailing and the healthy, died Friday from the
disease. She was 54.
   Miss Ireland, the wife of her frequent action movie co-star
Charles Bronson, died at her home at 11:30 a.m.
   Her husband, mother Dorothy, brother John, sons Paul and
Valentine McCallum, and daughter Zulieka Bronson were with her,
said publicist Lori Jonas.
   The actress first underwent surgery in 1984 for removal of a
cancerous right breast and eight lymph nodes under her arm. The
cancer, after a brief remission, spread to her lungs.
   Last April, Miss Ireland began feeling pain in her shoulder and
was diagnosed with cancer that had spread to her lungs, hip, femur
and thyroid.
   In books and frequent lectures about her battle with the
disease, Miss Ireland spoke eloquently about self-respect and
optimism in the face of devastating illness. She called herself a
survivor, not a victim.
   ``I don't want to die,'' she said in early 1989. ``It's not an
OK thing. Not right now. We all die one day but I am not in the
mood to do it yet.''
   Her life was filled with calamity. Her adopted son, Jason
McCallum, a longtime drug abuser, died in November from a lethal
drug mixture that had been injected and ingested. He was to have
been married a few days later.
   Miss Ireland wrote about fighting the disease in her best-seller
``Life Wish.'' At the time of her death she was completing ``Life
Times,'' profiles of some of her friends.
   Encouraging women who had undergone mastectomies, Miss Ireland
said, ``Think of yourself and be happy, make the most of your life
and put yourself first. ... A breast does not make me who I am.''
   Appearing frail and gaunt, she received a star on the Hollywood
Walk of Fame in April. ``This is really quite a thrill,'' she said
in a hoarse voice.
   At the Walk of Fame ceremony, comedian Joan Rivers praised Miss
Ireland as ``an incredible woman'' and ``a loyal mother, a good
friend and a role model for everyone today.''
   ``I knew Jill since she was 17 and she was always a remarkable
person,'' film director Michael Winner said. ``In her final years,
which were tragically beset by cancer, she transcended her fame as
an actress and showed that the human spirit in adversity can be a
wondrous thing. She never thought of herself and her pain. She
thought of her family and her friends and of other people who
suffered from cancer. It was an extraordinary spirit and in spite
of the illness, the spirit never faded.''

<HEAD>De Maiziere to Push For Reconciliation with Jews</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere
pledged to work for his nation's reconciliation with Jews and
accepted an invitation from the World Jewish Congress to visit the
United States, officials said Friday.
   For more than four decades, the now-ousted Communist regime
denied any role in the Nazi massacre of 6 million Jews. The
Communists claimed that as anti-fascists, they were not responsible
for the Holocaust.
   But one of the first acts of the recently elected East German
legislature was to apologize to Jews, a move that drew praise from
world leaders.
   De Maiziere is expected to make his American trip early next
month, and there were indications the democratically elected leader
would also meet with President Bush in Washington.
   The Christian Democratic prime minister will become the first
government leader from his country to make a U.S. trip.
   The United States refused to welcome longtime East German leader
Erich Honecker, in large part because of his Communist regime's
policy of shooting would-be escapees. Honecker was ousted in last
fall's peaceful revolution.
   ADN, East Germany's state news agency, said de Maiziere accepted
an invitation from World Jewish Congress President Edgar M.
Bronfman. The two men met during a meeting of the congress earlier
this month in Berlin.
   The news agency quoted Maram Stern, political adviser to
Bronfman, as saying a ``meeting at the highest level in the White
House'' was also possible.
   De Maiziere became prime minister following East Germany's first
democratic elections March 18.
   ``Our meeting on May 8, 1990, 45 years after the liberation from
Nazi barbarism, was a step into a reconciled common future,'' de
Maiziere wrote to Bronfman. ``That our request for forgiveness was
granted is hope for us.''
   During that meeting, Bronfman said East Germany has a long way
to go in teaching its young people about the horrors of the Nazi
past.
   In his letter, De Maiziere promised his government will resist
``all signs of racism, anti-Semitism, hostility to foreigners and
discrimination.''

   Britain's Prince Philip said Friday that
people will begin to get serious about global warming when they
realize its potential effect.
   In a question-and-answer session at the National Press Club
after a brief stop at the White House, Philip was asked about
President Bush's recent suggestion that global warning needed
further study.
   ``I am no expert on this,'' Philip said. ``I suspect that as
soon as people realize there is a chance of global warming and the
fact that it is going to affect their livelihood, I think they will
put some pressure on.
   ``If any of you live on the coast, I would start taking an
interest in global warming now or else start moving up into the
mountains,'' he said.
   Philip, international president of the World Wildlife Fund, was
in Washington to attend a Friday night dinner winding up a North
American conference on religion and ecology.
   The White House said no public statement about Philip's private
meeting with Bush would be issued.
   Philip, asked if the United States was doing its share to
protect the world's environment, said he didn't think he was
``capable of answering that question. I don't know for sure what
the share ought to be.''
   Scientists agree that man-made pollution, especially the release
of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, is causing heat to be
trapped and will result in a warming of the globe. But the severity
of the warming and how specific regions of the Earth will be
affected is not as clear.
   Some computer models have suggested the global temperatures
could increase by as much as four to nine degrees Fahrenheit by the
middle of the next century, causing coastal flooding and a shift of
weather and agriculture patterns.
   Other scientists say the impact is uncertain because of a
variety of factors, such as the uncertain effect of clouds.
   Bush opened an international conference on climate change last
month by saying that more research is needed ``to sort out the
science'' of the effect of carbon dioxide and other so-called
greenhouse pollutants.
   Speaking at the close of the conference, after his remarks were
sharply criticized by members of some of the European delegations,
Bush said ``we have never considered research a substitute for
action.''
   Philip, husband of Queen Elizabeth II, was to attend a Saturday
service marking the inauguration of the newly completed west front
of Washington National Cathedral.
   Construction of the cathedral, begun in 1907, is scheduled to be
finished this year.

   The State Department won court permission
Friday to use electronic surveillance of suspected spy Felix S.
Bloch in proceedings to dismiss the veteran diplomat.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley S. Harris ruled that the FBI's
electronic surveillances of Bloch had complied with the
requirements of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
   Harris rejected Bloch's attempt to prevent the State Department
from using two conversations and an excerpt from a third as
evidence in proceedings to fire the suspended diplomat from the
Foreign Service.
   The FBI has said it suspects Bloch of selling secrets to the
Soviet Union while he was posted in Europe. However, he has never
been charged with espionage.
   The State Department placed Bloch on administrative leave last
June and in February initiated efforts to fire him. The 30-year
Foreign Service veteran, who served most recently as a high-ranking
official in the U.S. Embassy in Vienna, is challenging his
dismissal.
   Papers unsealed in U.S. District Court indicate that Bloch's
apartment, telephone and car have been under electronic
surveillance for as long as two years.
   Harris denied a request by Bloch's attorneys to obtain tapes and
transcripts of all the conversations recorded by the FBI.
   Defense lawyers have been told the contents of two conversations
and part of a third that the State Department plans to use as
evidence.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh signed an affidavit opposing
the release of any further surveillance information, saying its
disclosure could jeopardize national security.
   Papers filed by Bloch's lawyers on May 2 indicate the FBI
recorded conversations between the suspect and his wife.
   Such conversations could not be used as evidence in court
because discussions between a husband and wife are privileged.

<HEAD>Ag Department Forecasts Decline in Consumer Food Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmland prices are going up again, but
consumer food prices probably will decline the rest of the year,
the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Nationally, farmland values _ including buildings _ are expected
to rise 3 percent to 4 percent. Average prices rose 4 percent in
1989.
   Food prices are expected to rise an average of 3 percent to 5
percent in 1990 after a 5.7 percent gain last year. That has been
the agency's forecast since last fall.
   But the new report said consumer food prices jumped an annual
rate of 13.7 percent in the first quarter of this year, primarily
the result of the December freeze damage to vegetables and fruit in
Florida and Texas.
   ``Another such shock is unlikely, and food prices probably will
decline for the last three quarters of the year,'' the report said.
   Analysts said the forecast on farmland values was tempered by
uncertainty over the weather, the 1990 farm bill in Congress,
possible revisions in the capital gains tax, and on-going trade
liberalization talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.

<TEXT>
   Bob Hope is sitting in his spacious home,
surveying his vast estate, and trying to explain just why, after 50
years of traversing the planet entertaining U.S. soldiers, he still
does it.
   After a long pause, he finally says, ``It's kind of exciting.''
   Must be. At age 86, he has racked up 9 million miles on his
frequent-flier account, going from Newfoundland to Greenland, from
North Africa to South Vietnam, and stopping at nearly every place
in between.
   Every place there is a war involving U.S. troops, that is.
   Except for this time. On Saturday night, NBC will broadcast
``Bob Hope's USO Road to the Berlin Wall and Moscow,'' marking the
comedian's 50th year of entertaining soldiers and the first time he
has done such a tour where no combat was involved.
   Traveling with Brooke Shields, Rosemary Clooney, Les Brown and
His Band of Renown, LaToya Jackson and, of course, Miss Universe
1990, Hope took his show on the road this month to Great Britain,
Germany and the Soviet Union.
   It was the first time that Hope had been back to Moscow since
1958, when the Cold War was in full freeze and Nikita Khrushchev
was in the Kremlin.
   With Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost, Eastern Europe turned on its
ear and the Berlin Wall crumbling, how did Hope feel viewing it
firsthand?
   He ruminates on this for a while. ``It's very different,'' he
said.
   The man with the trademark one-liners, the comedian who has
become synonymous with American comedy, is strangely inarticulate
when it comes to discussing his feelings about doing these shows.
   Rather, he spins funny yarns, one-line anecdotes and
recollections about friends, U.S. presidents and generals who are
long gone.
   ``Bing and I had an offer to become lieutenant commanders in the
Navy,'' Hope said of the late Bing Crosby. ``But Roosevelt said no.
He said we'd be more valuable entertaining all the troops.''
   The man has been hauling comedians, dancers, gorgeous women and
assorted joke writers across myriad battle lines since 1941. His
most recent trip before this one was to the Persian Gulf in 1987,
where he performed on rolling battleships.
   In 1984, he went to Beirut, a place that made him a little
nervous, he admits, ``because you never know when they're going to
turn around and throw a bomb at you.''
   The Moscow that Hope found this month is very different from the
one he left in 1958, when he became the first American comedian to
do a show there. In his just-published book ``Don't Shoot, It's
Only Me,'' Hope describes his experiences 32 years ago thusly:
   ``I don't know if the rooms were really bugged, but whenever we
entered we'd talk to the doorknob, we'd talk to the chair, and to
the pictures on the wall. And when we left, (we'd) face the wall
and shout, `that concludes our broadcast for this evening. Be sure
to stay tuned for Lawrence Welk.'''
   This time, Hope was more impressed by the growing capitalism in
Communism and the long line for the newly opened McDonald's.
   ``We did a bit at McDonald's,'' Hope recalled. ``I walked up to
these people in line and said to one guy, `How long have you been
here?' He answers `four hours.' The guy behind him says, `I was
born here.' ''

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany on Friday toughened its visa
requirements for Romanians in an effort to stop a flood of refugees
from that troubled country, an East Berlin government official said.
   The East German commissioner for foreigners, however, criticized
the decision. ``Our historic and humanitarian responsibility ...
demands more far-sightedness,'' said Almuth Berger.
   In the last two weeks, thousands of Romanians have been pouring
into East Germany, lured by its imminent unification with West
Germany and fleeing political strife and uncertainty in their own
country.
   Romanians overthrew Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in a
bloody December revolution. They are scheduled to vote in national
elections Sunday after a campaign that has frequently turned
violent.
   In another move, the East German government said it was lifting
visa requirements for citizens of Belgium, France, Luxemburg and
the Netherlands, the state news service ADN reported.
   ADN said the government was taking the action to advance
European unity.
   A government spokesman said East Germany will now require
Romanians to prove that they have a personal invitation from an
East German before they are allowed to enter.
   Nearly 2,000 Romanian refugees have been housed at barracks
buildings around East Berlin. Thousands more are believed inside
the country, and train stations have become homes to hundreds.
   The past few days have seen a marked increase in the number of
Romanians on the streets in both East Berlin and West Berlin, many
of them begging.
   The government spokesman said the visa rules were stiffened
because East Germany's ability to house the impoverished refugees
is being stretched. The spokesman said the restrictions were made
while officials prepare a new law dealing with foreigners seeking
asylum.
   An estimated 500,000 East Germans fled their own country over
the past year to escape the former Communist regime and seek
prosperity in the West. They were taken in by West Germany.
   Their exodus gave rise to East Germany's peaceful revolution
that toppled four decades of Communism and led to the nation's
first democratic government.
   A flood of Romanians, Poles and other groups into East Germany
in recent months has heightened German resentment of foreigners as
the nation moves closer to a free market.
   The two Germanys signed an economic treaty Friday and plan to
merge their economies by July 2. The merger is expected to force
many East German factories to close, triggering widespread
unemployment.
   The new rules for Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Luxemburg
allow their citizens to enter without visas and stay for up to
three months.
   Westerners had only limited travel privileges in the country
under the ousted Communist regime.
   The government also was preparing to lift visa requirements for
citizens of Greece, Great Britain, Ireland, Sweden, Norway, Malta,
Portugal and Switzerland, ADN said.

   The Pacific Northwest should prepared for the
economic fallout that would result from listing the northern
spotted owl as a threatened species, an Interior Department
spokesman said Friday.
   U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director John Turner insisted,
however, that no decision to list the rare owl had been made.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. discounted reports that the
decision already had been made.
   ``That's just scuttlebutt, grapevine and a rumor mill,'' Lujan
said Friday in Boston.
   The Boston Globe reported Friday that Lujan told Interior
Department employees in Boston a day earlier that the owl would be
listed under the Endangered Species Act on June 23 and that the
Pacific Northwest timber industry would suffer as a result.
   Interior Department spokesman Steve Goldstein said, however,
that Lujan was speaking theoretically. He said Lujan was outlining
a series of ``what ifs'' for ``planning purposes.''
   Officials with the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land
Management predict that if the owl is listed, land setasides to
protect its habitat would cause Northwest timber harvests to be cut
nearly in half. That could costing the region as many as 28,000
jobs by the end of the decade, they claim.
   ``I think we have to look at these things realistically,''
Goldstein said in an interview.
   ``We can't bury our face in the sand. We are dealing with 30,000
jobs,'' he added. ``The secretary is saying that for planning
purposes it is better to assume the listing might occur. It is
better to take steps to prepare for that.''

   Actor William Sanderson, who portrays
Larry on the CBS-TV show ``Newhart,'' says the usually silent
brothers Darryl and Darryl will speak during the series' final
episode Monday night.
   ``It's a bizarre episode worth watching,'' Sanderson said Friday
by telephone from Raleigh, N.C., where he was visiting. ``It has
some great surprises at the end. They shot two endings, and I don't
know which one they'll use.''
   He also said Larry, Darryl and Darryl have a love interest in
the final show.
   ``It's three women,'' he said. ``We sort of get lucky. I wish I
could tell you more, but I can't betray somebody.''
   The final show, he said, has a Japanese investor buying
Newhart's Vermont inn and turning the property into a golf course.
   ``I think it's a good way to end it if you have to end it,'' he
said. ``There's talk of a spinoff. We may come back and we may
not.''
   On the show, Larry has always done the talking for the three,
who are plain mountain folk. This time, Sanderson said, ``My
brothers are going to talk.''

   Six Eastern European nations would be
the beneficiaries of a $400 billion aid plan by the 23-member
Council of Europe, the group's president said Friday.
   The money would be used to help the countries move from
state-run central economies toward a free market, said Anders
Bjoerck, president of the council's parliamentary assembly.
   He told reporters the aid plan would be coordinated by the
European Community, the International Monetary Fund and the United
States, Canada and Japan.
   More discussion of the plan is set next week in Stockholm, he
said.
   Bjoerck gave no details on when the program would start, what
form the aid would take or how long it would run.
   He spoke at the end of a three-day conference here, organized by
the Strasbourg, France-based Council of Europe, on economic reform
in Eastern Europe.
   The six countries, while not named Friday, are expected to
include Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia, all
suffering from economic problems. Names of the six are expected to
be revealed in Stockholm next week.
   Participants agreed on the need for economic reforms in the
countries involved. However, they differed on what the pace should
be.
   Many fear that rapid conversion to market methods will lead to
widespread joblessness and high inflation.
   Salvatore Zecchini, deputy secretary general of the Paris-based
Organization of Economic Development, told the conference: ``The
new East European democracies will be short-lived if they fail to
raise living standards.''
   The plan is seen as a preliminary program akin to the infusion
given to Western Europe's wrecked economies after World War II
under the Marshall Plan.
   Bjoerck met Friday with Hungarian prime minister-designate
Jozsef Antall, who on May 22 will announce his center-right
government's plan for reforming Hungary's economy and reducing the
country's $20 billion foreign debt.
   Antall is to go to Strasbourg in September to address the
parliamentary assembly of the Council, Bjoerck said.

<TEXT>
   A man convicted of plotting to kill a boy
as part of a movie was sentenced Friday to 33 years in prison. No
child was actually harmed.
   ``I've never had as heinous (a crime) as this,'' U.S. District
Judge T.S. Ellis III said in sentencing Daniel Depew. The judge
called the case ``as chilling and as evil as anything I can think
of.''
   Ellis rejected a contention by the 28-year-old resident of
Alexandria, a suburb of Washington, that talk of plans to kidnap,
torture and kill a boy were merely a fantasy.
   ``There's no doubt in my mind that you intended to go through
with it,'' Ellis said.
   Depew was convicted in March on two counts of conspiracy. He
could have been sentenced to a life prison term.
   The judge recommended that Depew, who has AIDS, be sent to a
federal prison in Buttner, N.C., where medical and mental treatment
facilities are available. However, a final decision on his
placement remains with the federal Bureau of Prisons.
   The sentence ``adequately meets the goals of deterrent and
retribution'' the judge stated. But he added that he did not
believe rehabilitation was possible in Depew's case.
   Depew was silent at the hearing, but his attorney, James Lowe,
noted that his client had presented a letter to Ellis saying he had
not intended to proceed with the scheme.
   Another man, Dean Lambey, 34, of Richmond, pleaded guilty to
conspiracy and sexual exploitation charges in November and was
sentenced to 30 years in prison.
   They were arrested in August following a six-month investigation
that began when undercover police in San Jose, Calif., contacted
Lambey through a computer bulletin board he used to advertise his
interest in sex with children.
   A statement of facts entered at Lambey's sentencing said he told
an undercover investigator he was considering abducting a teen-aged
boy he had seen riding a bicycle. Lambey and Depew would then
videotape the sexual molestation and murder of the boy, according
to the statement.

   Now that Barbara Bush is bringing Raisa
Gorbachev along to share the podium at the Wellesley College
graduation, more students say they have someone with whom they can
identify.
   The big worry has become is the crush of reporters coming to the
June 1 commencement.
   The climate on campus Friday had changed from last month, when
it was announced that Mrs. Bush would give the commencement
address. Some of the 600 seniors protested then that the first lady
is likeable but doesn't cut it as a role model.
   About 150 of Wellesley's 2,200 students signed a petition that
said Mrs. Bush ``gained recognition through her husband's
achievements,'' not her own, ``which contradicts what we have been
taught over our years at Wellesley.''
   On Friday, it was Mrs. Gorbachev, the wife of Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who was the talk of Cazenove Hall, a
dormitory at the 120-year-old women's college. Students said they
liked the fact that Mrs. Gorbachev, a former college professor, had
a career independent of her husband's.
   ``I'm really excited,'' senior Angie Hickman, 21, of New York
City, said as she chewed thoughtfully on her breakfast oatmeal.
``She might have something more interesting to say.''
   ``She does seem to have a different identity from her husband,''
said Susan Brandzel, 21, of Seattle. ``This is making graduation
better.''
   Holly Benton, 22, of Norfolk, Va., called Mrs. Bush ``the U.S.
representative wife.''
   ``Having Raisa is going to make it a lot more political,'' Ms.
Benton said. ``She has done her own thing. It's really exciting and
it's going to make a tremendous statement about how big this issue
(of role models) has become.''
   Her roommate and fellow senior, Molly Spofford, 21, of Manhattan
Beach, Calif., complained that Mrs. Gorbachev is almost too good _
a superwoman.
   ``She reinforces the idea that we should `do it all,''' Ms.
Spofford said. Still, she added, ``It's ideal that we have both of
them. It's emblematic of the last year of international events.''
   But like other students, she said she was concerned about the
graduates falling in the shadow of news media attention on the two
older women.
   Ms. Spofford said she learned about Mrs. Gorbachev's visit when
a local television station Thursday night promised ``full
coverage.''
   ``Who wants full coverage of our graduation?'' she frowned.
   The 58-year-old Mrs. Gorbachev is a former university lecturer
with a doctorate in philosophy from Moscow State University. She
met her future husband in a ballroom dancing class while he was in
law school and she was a graduate student from Siberia.
   Mrs. Bush dropped out of Smith College after her freshman year
in 1944 to marry Bush, then a Navy pilot. Since then, Mrs. Bush,
who turns 65 on June 8, has been a career homemaker, raising six
children. She's also been a lifelong volunteer.
   In recent years she has gained recognitions for promoting
literacy and other causes, including the care of babies with AIDS.
   Wellesley granted Mrs. Bush's request that she bring along Mrs.
Gorbachev to speak while their husbands are holding their summit
meeting.
   It became official Thursday.
   Anna Perez, press secretary for the first lady, said Mrs. Bush
was ``absolutely delighted'' that her Soviet guest could come along.
   The two first ladies will travel together to Wellesley on the
second day of their husbands' four-day summit at the White House
and Camp David, Md.
   It wasn't immediately known if Mrs. Gorbachev would give her
speech in English. A call to the Soviet Embassy in Washington was
not returned.

<TEXT>
   A legacy of gold left about 100 years ago
by a pioneering Montana miner is finally in the hands of his heirs
after it languished for years in a bank vault.
   Two California women on Thursday claimed their
great-grandfather's bequest, worth an estimated $10,000, which was
taken from the hills of Montana in the late 1800s.
   The gold mined by John Lehsou, a German immigrant and early
Montana settler, was found in the vault of a Missoula bank early
this year in a small cardboard box, said James McKeon of the
Revenue Department's Abandoned Property Bureau.
   Lehsou quit mining in the early 1890s and died in 1921 at age 81.
   After a four-month search for heirs, officials handed over about
20 ounces of Lehsou's gold to sisters Jane Leonard, of Clayton,
Calif., and Lorri Stacy, of Ventura, Calif.
   The cache included 77 nuggets and a small vial of gold dust. The
largest nugget weighs almost 4{ ounces.
   Ms. Stacy said the family knew about their ancestor's mining
exploits and wasn't entirely surprised that some gold turned up.
   ``I'd always heard stories of the old timers up there seeing him
walking out with coffee cans of gold, and here it is,'' she said.
   A brother and two aunts will share the treasure, she said.
   The spot price of gold Friday was about $370 an ounce, but the
find could bring as much as $10,000 if sold together for
exhibition, said local metals trader Wayne Miller.
   ``There's a value there beyond what gold is there'' because of
the history linked to the treasure and the unusually large nuggets,
Miller said. Normally, gold nuggets found in Montana are three
ounces or less, he said.

   Gov. John Ashcroft apologized Friday
for his wife's after-hours use of the state library on Mother's Day
so she and their son could do a homework assignment.
   ``If anybody's been offended, I'm pleased to apologize to
them,'' Ashcroft said in an interview. ``I don't want to offend
people. That's not my intention nor is it the intention of my
family.''
   Janet Ashcroft and 12-year-old Andy Ashcroft used the library,
an information source for government agencies, for about 2{ hours
Sunday night. The library is normally open only during the day,
Monday through Friday.
   They were working on a history report by the seventh-grader on
life in Elizabethan England.
   The governor said Mrs. Ashcroft ``told me that she intended to
get no special privileges,'' and had only inquired Sunday afternoon
``if the facility was available to her.''
   A senior library associate and later, state librarian Monteria
Hightower, came to let the Ashcrofts in.
   Mrs. Hightower has said the state library is not supposed to be
used for youngsters' homework, and should not have been opened
after hours. She also said the call disturbed her Mother's Day
activities with her family.
   The governor offered an apology to the librarian. ``I don't want
to offend Mrs. Hightower,'' he said during the interview.
   Mrs. Ashcroft has declined comment.

<TEXT>
   A teen-age boy was acquitted in the
sexual attack and drowning of an 8-year-old girl, outraging
residents of the small town where they both lived.
   Jurors in Houlton found Trey Emery, 18, innocent of murder
Thursday night in the October 1988 death of Heather White.
   ``It's all over and the killer is loose,'' said Donald Turek, a
friend of the White family. ``That's not right. This could happen
again. Whether it's five months or six years, it could happen
again.''
   Emery showed no emotion during his Aroostook County Superior
Court trial until the verdict came in, when he smiled. He was
whisked away from the court by sheriff's deputies without making
any comment.
   The killing prompted high emotion in the community of 1,300,
some 30 miles north of Bangor. The girl was sexually abused before
being choked and thrown into the Penobscot River to drown,
prosecutors said.
   Citizens staged protests when Emery, who was 16 at the time of
the killing, was freed to the custody of his parents. The trial was
moved from Bangor to Houlton because of intense publicity.
   With Emery's acquittal, the state has closed the case, said
Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Hjelm.
   Emery testified he was with the girl in the woods the day she
died, but he last saw her walking away with a boy who appeared to
be 10 or 11 years old. Emery said he had nothing to do with the
killing.
   Emery's lawyer, Richard Broderick, said he was unsure about the
young man's future plans, but he acknowledged it would be difficult
for Emery to continue to live in West Enfield.

<HEAD>Ethiopian Envoy Can't Meet Conditions; State Department Scraps
Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tentative U.S. effort to upgrade relations
with Ethiopia suffered a setback Friday when an Ethiopian envoy
failed to meet U.S. conditions concerning famine relief and Jewish
emigration, officials said.
   Kassa Kebede, a senior Ethiopian official, had been scheduled to
meet with Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger but the
State Department postponed the appointment when it became clear
that the U.S. conditions would not be met.
   U.S. officials, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said
they did not believe the setback had dealt a fatal blow to efforts
to establish better relations with Ethiopia.
   In announcing the postponement Friday, State Department press
officer Dave Denney said Kebede was returning home for further
consultations.
   ``We remain prepared for serious dialogue on famine relief, open
emigration and other issues with the Ethiopian government,'' he
said.
   The United States and Ethiopia's leftist government have had
virtually no high-level contact for more than a decade. Each has an
embassy in the other's capital but not an ambassador.
   The officials said that Kebede's visit held out the possibility
that the United States would permit Ethiopia to send an ambassador
to Washington.
   Eagleburger would have received Kebede if he had pledged to work
with United Nations officials on opening the Red Sea port of
Massawa so that relief supplies could get through to famine-plagued
areas, the officials said.
   Massawa is in the hands of Eritrean rebel forces fighting the
Ethiopian government, but insurgent leaders have said they would be
willing to make it an open city for the purpose of relief aid.
   Besides the humanitarian aid issue, the State Department had
conditioned Kebede's meeting with Eagleburger on assurances that
Ethiopia would allow an estimated 3,000 Ethiopian Jews _ known as
Falashas _ to emigrate to Israel.
   For the administration to accept an Ethiopian ambassador in
Washington, both conditions would have to be met, the officials
said.
   Kebede is a half brother of Ethiopian leader Mengistu Haile
Mariam and is described as a senior foreign policy official. He had
met earlier with top officials of the Africa and human rights
bureaus at the State Department.
   On the food issue, State Department deputy spokesman Richard
Boucher said U.N. Secretary General Perez de Cuellar has reported
that Ethiopian authorities have said they are prepared to discuss
use of additional relief routes.
   ``We're encouraged by this news and we hope that discussions
will begin as soon as possible and will include the issue of
Massawa,'' he said.
   On Thursday, the House Select Committee on Hunger said the lives
of up to 5 million Ethiopians were at risk because of civil war in
Ethiopia.
   The committee urged President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev to make Ethiopia an urgent agenda item and to work
jointly for a cease fire so that full-scale relief efforts could
begin.

<HEAD>Officials Note Large Drop in Number of Illegal Haitian Boat People</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of Haitians heading to the United States
in small boats has dropped by 90 percent this year because of a
lull in political unrest and a $30 million Coast Guard high-seas
interception program, officials said.
   In the first four months of this year, 242 Haitians were
intercepted by Coast Guard boats and returned to Haiti, compared
with 2,801 in the same period last year, Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Jeff
Karonis said Friday.
   The total number of people stopped on the high seas all of last
year was 3,706. Since the program began in May 1989, the Coast
Guard has doubled its patrols and increased surveillance flights.
   Most boats intercepted at sea are returned to Haiti.
   ``The goal has been to intercept as many Haitians at sea before
they reach the U.S. as possible,'' Karonis said. ``From that point
of view, interdiction has been a success.''
   Susan Clyde, spokeswoman at the American Embassy in
Port-au-Prince, said efforts to reduce the number of fraudulent
documents used by those fleeing strife-torn Haiti also helped.
   Cheryl Little, an attorney for the Haitian Refugee Center in
Miami, said easing social tensions on the impoverished Carribean
island nation about 600 miles southeast of Miami also contributed.
   ``We've seen rises and drops over the last few years because
there is a correlation between political unrest and the number of
people coming,'' she said.
   Haitians are waiting to see what will be done by interim
President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, who took over after Prosper Avril
resigned in March in the face of widespread unrest, Ms. Little said.
   ``If Pascal-Trouillot was overthrown today, you'd see large
numbers of people coming,'' she said.

<HEAD>Government Announces Plan to Speed Up Access to AIDS Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal health officials on Friday announced a
plan designed to speed AIDS patients' access to promising
experimental drugs.
   The proposal would allow an experimental drug that has been
tested for safety to be made available to patients who have no
treatment alternative.
   Those patients would be getting the drugs at the same time as
patients who are participating in the second phase of clinical
trials, when drugs found to be safe are tested to determine their
effectiveness.
   ``We are proposing this initiative because of its potential for
prolonging lives,'' said Dr. James Mason, assistant secretary for
health in the Department of Health and Human Services.
   Officials cautioned that the plan would not replace or
substitute for conventional drug-testing trials, which are required
for marketing approval by the Food and Drug Administration.
   ``We believe we have built sufficient safeguards ... to ensure
that it neither compromises the drug approval and clinical trials
process nor delays the speedy delivery of promising investigational
agents from the laboratory to the bedside,'' Mason said.
   Officials said they didn't know which drug would be the first to
be used as part of the plan, called parallel track.
   The plan is similar to the expanded access system set up for the
anti-AIDS drug DDI, or dideoxyinosine.
   However, under the DDI plan, patients who were not in the
clinical trials were getting the drug faster than the patients
participating in the controlled trials because of the time it takes
to set up such testing.
   ``With parallel track, that wouldn't happen,'' said James Allen,
director of the National AIDS Program Office. ``Clinical trials
would need to be under way or at least starting at the time the
drug would be made available'' for the wider distribution.
   The parallel track idea was initiated last summer.
   The Public Health Service, which includes the National
Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration, is
proposing that it be used at first only for people with AIDS or
those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus that causes
AIDS.
   But health officials said they would consider expanding the plan
to make experimental drugs for other life-threatening diseases
available to patients earlier.
   The proposal is to be published Monday in the Federal Register.
The Public Health Service is accepting public comments for the next
60 days, after which it can publish a final rule.

<HEAD>Government to End Secrecy of Health Records for Weapons Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ The government said Friday it will release the
long-secret health records of 200,000 people who performed some of
the riskiest tasks in building nuclear weapons.
   The information, dating to the start of U.S. atomic bomb
building in the early 1940s, is considered by experts to be the
nation's most detailed information about the long-term effects on
human health of chronic exposure to low-level radiation.
   The government has maintained that its weapons plant staffers
are not exposed to appreciable health dangers, although some recent
studies have indicated that the workers may be developing unusually
high rates of cancers related to radiation.
   A court-supervised group, the Three Mile Island Public Health
Fund, sued the Energy Department for release of the documents in
1989 after the department rejected an earlier request for the data
under the Freedom of Information Act. The group was formed after
the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant accident in 1979.
   An out-of-court settlement to release the data took effect
Friday. It requires the department to turn over the information,
including death records, medical records and data on worker's
historical exposure to radiation, to the Three Mile Island's main
scientific investigators, Dr. Alice Stewart and Dr. George Kneale.
   Daniel Berger, an attorney for the group, said other qualified
researchers could join in analyzing the data but that it would not
be made generally available to the public.
   The Energy Department said in a statement that the Three Mile
Island group agreed to let the Society for Epidemiologic Research,
a professional organization, review its planned use of the worker
records to determine if it has scientific merit.
   Dr. Ken Lichtenstein, an associate clinical professor at the
University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, said it was
important that the government finally allow independent researchers
to review data on the weapons plant workers.
   ``This is the first time that people who do not have a vested
interest in the weapons plants will be given a chance to review the
data,'' said Lichtenstein, also an expert on health issues at the
Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant near Denver.
   The department agreed to release on June 18 the health and
occupational records of 50,000 men and women who have worked at the
Hanford nuclear reservation in south-central Washington state. The
facility produced plutonium for the first atomic bombs.
   By Aug. 18 the department is to furnish data on people who
worked at the Savannah River Site, near Aiken., S.C., which
produces tritium gas used in warhead production; the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory at Oak Ridge, Tenn.; and the now-closed K-25
gaseous diffusion plant at Oak Ridge, where uranium was enriched
for reactor fuel.
   Berger said that within six months, and possibly as early as
three months, the department will turn over worker records covering
the Rocky Flats plutonium milling and reprocessing facility; the
Mound Laboratory near Miamisburg, Ohio, where tritium is recycled;
the Los Alamos National Laboratory, at Los Alamos, N.M., which
designs nuclear weapons; a Los Alamos maintenance facility; and the
Pantex final weapons assembly plant near Amarillo, Texas.
   Finally, the department has one year to supply data on workers
at the Fernald uranium processing plant in Ohio and the
Mallinckrodt Chemical Works in St. Louis, which purified plutonium
in the early days of the bomb-building program.
   ``It's a historic development,'' said Berger, adding that the
data cover one-third of all people who have worked in the nuclear
weapons program since its inception. He said the 200,000 for which
records will be disclosed were employed at facilities where
operations entailed the largest amounts of radiation.
   Scientific interest in the data has grown since the National
Research Council reported in a study last December that low-level
exposures to X-rays and gamma rays pose a cancer risk three to four
times greater than previously believed.
   In a related development, the department on Friday made public a
report by a panel of government-appointed scientists who sought to
determine whether the National Research Council's conclusion should
affect weapons plant operations.
   The scientists, in a report dated March 1990, said the risks
cited by the National Research Council do not justify changing
Energy Department limits on worker exposure to radiation. Peter
Brush, acting assistant energy secretary for environment, safety
and health, said the department is to issue its own assessment of
the implications of the research council's study by the end of June.

<HEAD>Agency Says Farmers Taking Less Land from Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers are taking about 20 percent less
cropland from production in 1990 than they did last year under
government acreage programs, according to preliminary figures
released Friday by the Agriculture Department.
   Under this year's commodity programs, farmers will idle 24.8
million acres, compared with 30.9 million taken from production
under the 1989 programs, the USDA report showed.
   Most of the reduction in idled land signed up in the 1990
program is in wheat and feed grains acreage. Sharp production
increases have been projected by USDA for those commodities this
year.
   To be eligible for federal price support and related benefits,
farmers are required to take a percentage of their base acres from
crop production and put the land in conservation uses that help
protect the soil.
   The idled acres signed up for 1990 included: corn, 9.8 million
acres, down from 10.8 million in 1989; sorghum, 2.9 million, down
from 3.3 million; barley, 2.4 million, up from 2.3 million; and
oats, 230,000 acres, down from 310,000. Feed grains totaled 15.3
million acres, down from 16.7 million in 1989.
   Wheat signed up in the 1990 program included 6.6 million acres
of idled land, down from 9.6 million idled last year; upland
cotton, 1.9 million, down from 3.5 million; and rice, 1 million,
down from 1.1 million.
   The report said farmers enrolled 163.3 million acres of feed
grain, wheat, cotton and rice in the 1990 program, which
represented 75.4 percent of the 216.6 million acres in the national
base for those crops. The idled acres are part of the 163.3 million
acres that were enrolled.
   Last year's gross enrollment was 168 million acres, or 76.4
percent of the 1989 acreage base of 220 million acres.

<TEXT>
   A new kind of fog shrouds the City by the
Bay.
   Uncertainty about the itinerary of Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev on his visit the San Francisco Bay area next month is
causing headaches among those trying to plan everything from
security to sightseeing.
   Anxious hosts, reporters and would-be gawkers are among those
scrambling to prepare for the two-day tour with little information.
   About all that's known is that Gorbachev will arrive in San
Francisco on June 3 and visit Stanford University for at least two
hours the next day.
   ``Will it be a sit-down dinner or a speech? No one knows,''
Stanford spokeswoman Kathy O'Toole said Thursday.
   A planned luncheon with former President Reagan and area
business leaders seems most likely to take place June 4, said Harry
Oberlian, who heads the international program of the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce.
   There number of guests could range from 150 to 500, Oberlian
said.
   The event is designed to bring together officials from Soviet
and U.S. high technology companies. It could help further
Gorbachev's hopes of developing a business alliance between the
eastern Soviet Union and the West Coast, he said.
   ``That's been his dream all along, and the best way to achieve
that dream is to come over here,'' said Oberlian.
   At City Hall, officials were as hazy about the details as
anyone. It was unclear what role Mayor Art Agnos would play in
hosting Gorbachev.
   ``Whether it's giving President Gorbachev a personal tour or
putting together a meeting with business leaders _ the mayor is
ready to assist,'' said Agnos spokesman Scott Shafer.
   Gorbachev will require a security army made up of police,
university patrols, the California Highway Patrol and the Coast
Guard _ orchestrated by the Secret Service.
   San Francisco's tourist spots, like the Golden Gate Bridge and
Fisherman's Wharf, are logical stops for Gorbachev's first visit.
But like others, bridge officials and business owners said they
won't start preparing until the itinerary is confirmed.

   Authorities have found a large arms
cache hidden by leftist Salvadoran rebels who came to Honduras to
back anti-government guerrillas in this country, a police chief
said Friday.
   The weapons included 218 mortar rounds, automatic rifles, heavy
machine guns and 165 pounds of dynamite, said police Col. Paris
Rivera.
   ``It was an arsenal to perpetrate all kinds of crimes in
Honduras,'' he declared.
   The arms were discovered from information provided by a rebel
arrested in Honduras about a month ago, said Rivera, chief of the
2nd police district.
   Speaking at news conference at his headquarters in the northern
city of San Pedro Sula, he identified the arrested rebel as
31-year-old Marcelo Guzman.
   The police chief said Guzman had admitted he was a member of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. The group, also known as
the FMLN, has been trying to overthrow successive governments in
neighboring El Salvador for more than a decade.
   Guzman was living in San Pedro Sula, Honduras' second largest
city about 120 miles north of Tegucigalpa, while posing as a
businessman, Rivera said. The weapons were found in the nearby town
of Potrerillos.
   ``I'm very worried by what is happening,'' Rivera said. ``It is
surprising what the FMLN was planning to do in Honduras. ... It was
planning to support Honduran guerrilla groups to destabilize
President Rafael Leonardo Callejas' administration.''
   A small leftist guerrilla group has been active in this country
for nearly a decade. In the past, it has limited itself mostly to
exploding bombs and other terrorist attacks without mounting major
military offensives.

   Cable News Network anchorwoman
Catherine Crier told a gathering of lawyers that courtroom
competition and unnecessary lawsuits drove her from her post as a
Texas district judge.
   ``We have moved into an arena where competition is the thing,
and outdoing the other fellow may have surpassed the notion of
serving clients, of seeking justice,'' Crier told members of the
Grand Rapids Bar Association on Wednesday.
   Ms. Crier, 35, said she decided to accept CNN's offer in October
1989 in part because she was frustrated by unnecessary litigation,
including the case of a woman who sued her obstetrician because she
suffered pain during childbirth.
   ```It hurt,' she said. Well, I'm very sorry it hurt, but it
dragged the doctor into court for several years in the process,''
Ms. Crier said.
   In 1984, Crier became the youngest woman to be elected as a
state district judge in Texas.
   At CNN, she drew criticism at first for her lack of a journalism
background. She said her skills in public speaking, legal writing
and international relations helped her get the job.

   Hungary's main opposition party
protested Friday to the Soviet Embassy after two of its members,
due to attend a conference in the Baltic republic of Estonia, were
refused entry to the Soviet Union, the state news agency MTI said.
   Peter Krasztev, an East European affairs expert for the League
of Free Democrats, and fellow party member Ferenc Salamon were
stopped at Moscow's Sheremyetevo airport and refused permission to
enter the Soviet Union, MTI said.
   They were due to attend a conference called by Estonia's
People's Front in Tallinn for Saturday on Europe's political
transformation and the process known as CSCE (Conference for
Security and Cooperation in Europe).
   Thirty-five nations, including the Soviet Union, the United
States, Canada and all of Europe except Albania, signed the 1975
Helsinki Final Act and participate in CSCE.
   MTI said the two men returned to Budapest on Friday after being
informed by an unnamed Soviet visa official that the Vienna
Convention empowered authorities to refuse anyone entry.
   The Free Democrats, the second largest party in Hungary and main
opposition to the center-right government that will be sworn in May
22, protested the incident to the Soviet Embassy in Budapest, MTI
said.

<HEAD>Arab Ambassadors Press For Branding Of Jewish Settlements As
Illegal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arab ambassadors met with State Department
officials Friday to press for support of a U.N. Security Council
resolution branding as illegal the settlement of Soviet Jews in
territory occupied by Israel.
   But Clovis Maksoud, the Arab League representative in the United
States, said no agreement had been reached on efforts to craft a
mutually acceptable resolution.
   ``We are still in an ongoing discussion on this matter,''
Maksoud said after emerging from a meeting at the State Department
with Robert M. Kimmit, undersecretary of state for political
affairs.
   Maksoud, who accompanied the ambassadors of Egypt, Algeria and
Kuwait to the session, said Arab nations are insisting that the
resolution clearly brand Israel's settlement policy as a violation
of international law.
   ``We think that if the resolution does not state that the
settlements policy is illegal then Israel will not be deterred from
making more settlements,'' Maksoud said.
   ``To us this question of massive Soviet Jewish immigration is a
critical issue,'' Maksoud said.
   He said Arab nations currently ``have no guarantee that they
(Israel) are not going to continue these settlement policies.''
   Arab nations have been seeking a resolution that would both
criticize Israel and not be vetoed by the United States.
   They are concerned about prospects that the increasing flow of
Soviet Jewish refugees would be resettled in territory seized by
Israel in the 1967 war with its Arab neighbors. That would make
more difficult the fulfillment of the Arab goal of establishing a
Palestinian state in those areas.
   Israel has said that only a tiny fraction of the refugees have
been resettled in either the West Bank or Gaza Strip or in East
Jerusalem.
   The State Department has generally sided with the Arab position
that Soviet Jews not be settled in the occupied territories.
   While the Bush administration has opposed all settlement
activities in the territories it has stopped short of calling them
illegal.
   Maksoud said that the U.S. position is to support Soviet
immigration and oppose settlement in the occupied territories.
   ``We wanted this policy to be synchronized and we hope the
synchronization will take place in the form of positive support for
our efforts at the U.N,'' he said.

hear evidence in two Reagan administration scandals _ the
Iran-Contra affair and mismanagement of a major government housing
program.
   Prosecutors for independent counsels conducting the separate
investigations both made appearances before the newly empaneled
grand jury, which met behind closed doors at the U.S. Courthouse.
   Arlin M. Adams, the independent counsel appointed March 2 to
investigate allegations of criminal wrongdoing against former
Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr., made a brief appearance
before the grand jury with seven assistant prosecutors.
   Adams, who did not call any witnesses, apparently made the visit
to introduce his prosecution team.
   Additionally, Iran-Contra prosecutors from the office of
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh met for several hours with
the grand jury, which took testimony from an FBI agent.
   Walsh's continuing investigation will attempt to determine the
precise roles of President Reagan and then-Vice President Bush in
the sale of U.S. arms to Iran and covert assistance to the
Nicaraguan rebels, according to sources familiar with the
investigation.
   Adams' office also refused to comment on the progress of its
investigation of allegations of political favoritism in the
operation of a Department of Housing and Urban Development
low-income housing program.
   Adams, a former federal appellate judge from Philadelphia, was
recently appointed to investigate whether Pierce and his top aides
steered lucrative rent subsidies to politically connected
developers under the Moderate Rehabilitation Program.
   The prosecutor's appearance before the grand jury with seven
assistants signaled that Adams was prepared to start taking
testimony and issue subpoenas for evidence.
   Pierce served as HUD secretary for all eight years of the Reagan
administration. A House subcommittee has been conducting a lengthy
investigation into mismanagement of a number of HUD programs,
including the Moderate Rehabilitation Program.
   The program, which received a $225 million appropriation in
1989, provided rent subsidies to developers who perform a moderate
amount of rehabilitation on housing for low-income people.
   Congress voted not to appropriate any more money to the program
as a result of the HUD scandals. Jack Kemp, the new HUD secretary,
suspended disbursement of most of the money allocated for the 1989
fiscal year pending a review of the grant awards.
   In testimony before Congress, Pierce denied he participated in
any ``hands on'' management of the program or that he applied
political influence.
   Pierce refused to give additional testimony, pleading his Fifth
Amendment protection against self-incrimination.
   The court that appointed Adams assigned him to determine whether
Pierce or other HUD officials ``committed the crime of conspiracy
to defraud the United States or any other federal crimes'' while
running the Moderate Rehabilitation Program between 1984 and 1988.

<HEAD>Pentagon Orders Danger Pay For Personnel In Philippine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. military and Defense Department civilian
personnel in the Philippines will get pay increases because of
``unstable conditions'' in that country, the Pentagon announced
Friday.
   The decision to declare the Philippines an area of imminent
danger for special pay purposes comes in the wake of the shooting
last Sunday of two U.S. airmen near Clark Air Base by suspected
Communist guerrillas.
   The step has been taken, a Pentagon announcement said, ``because
of the current unstable conditions'' in the Philippines.
   The designation also affects State Department personnel working
in the country.
   The imminent danger pay amounts to a 15 percent increase in the
basic salary for civilian employees and $110 per month for all
military personnel, the statement said.
   There are 14,745 military personnel and 1,355 Defense Department
civilian workers in the country, the Pentagon said.
   The rebels are believed responsible for fatal shootings of
Airman John H. Raven, 19, of Delta Junction, Alaska, and Airman
James C. Green, 20, of Craig, Colo.
   Communist rebels have claimed responsibility for the killings
and have vowed to continue attacks on Americans until the six U.S.
bases in the Philippines are closed.
   Last Sunday's attack occurred on the eve of talks between U.S.
and Filipino negotiators on extending the lease for the U.S. bases.
That agreement expires in September 1991.

<HEAD>Mitchell Calls Bush's China Policy a Failure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's China policy has been a
failure that will be compounded if Bush continues
most-favored-nation trading status for Beijing, Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell said Friday.
   Bush sought to justify his cautious approach toward China a year
ago, after the massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators near
Tiananmen Square, by saying it was the best way to win human rights
concessions, Mitchell said.
   Imposing sanctions would isolate China and lessen the chances
for reform, Bush said.
   ``The Chinese government has sent no such signal and has not
moderated its course,'' Mitchell said in a speech on the floor of
the Senate. Political prisoners still are being held and Chinese
students in the United States still are being harassed, he said.
   ``The outcome of the administration's China policy is a failure,
a failure that is clear and complete,'' Mitchell said.
   Bush must signal Congress by June 3, the anniversary of the
Tiananmen Square crackdown, whether he intends to renew China's
favored trading status for another year.
   Lawmakers then would have up to 60 days to deny the status,
which provide the best available tariff treatment for imported
goods.
   ``It is time to abandon this failed policy, not to embellish it
with new concessions,'' Mitchell said.
   If Bush continues his China policy, ``we will have traded our
principles for the doubtful friendship of dictators, and we will
betray the trust of those who seek our support in their fight for
freedom,'' he said.

   A mail bomb linked to Basque separatists
exploded Friday at a brokerage firm in this Mediterranean port,
killing the manager and injuring five other people, a government
spokesman said.
   Juan Antonio Perez Herrero, 35, died in Valencia General
Hospital nearly six hours after the bomb went off at 12:15 p.m. in
the office of Intermediarios Financieros, according to the
spokesman, Manuel Miralles.
   The package was delivered to the office in this city 185 miles
south of Barcelona by a courier carrier.
   The spokesman said Perez Herrero and the other injured were
rushed to the hospital after the blast, which blew out the windows
of the second-story office.
   Four people were later released after being treatment for cuts
and bruises. The fifth remained in the hospital under observation.
   Although no group immediately claimed reponsibility for the
attack, officials said it bore the hallmarks of the Basque
separatist group ETA. The group has been behind other mail bombs in
recent weeks.
   ETA has staged a campaign of terror since 1968 to win
independence for the three-province northern Spanish Basque
country. ETA's name comes from initials in the Basque language
standing for ``homeland and liberty.''
   Perez Herrero's death brought to seven the number of terrorist
murders in Spain this year. ETA has claimed responsibility for five
of the deaths.
   On April 23, ETA sent two mail bombs to the Department of
Prisons in Madrid. One mangled the hand of an employee, and police
defused the second.
   On April 19, an ETA mail bomb seriously damaged the hand of a
woman working in Seville for Expo '92, the world's fair to be held
in 1992.

   Mills College trustees on Friday reversed
their decision to admit undergraduate men, after two weeks of
campus protests that shut down the 138-year-old school.
   Cheers, tears of triumph and popping champagne corks greeted the
announcement by board chairman Warren Hellman.
   ``All of you have had a lot of banners for us all week. Here's
one for you,'' Hellman told a crowd of about 300 women as he
unfurled a banner that read, ``Mills _ For Women. Again.''
   ``I think we have all won,'' he said.
   Two weeks ago, the trustees decided to admit males an
undergraduates because of financial problems stemming from
declining enrollment.
   During the ensuing demonstrations, women chanted ``Better Dead
Than Co-ed.'' Sensing victory, they ended their boycott of classes
Thursday.
   Alumnae raised $3 million during a seven-day telephone fund
drive after a group of former Mills' students met with Hellman and
offered a massive rescue effort.
   ``They made a bad decision and the community has risen to the
occasion and given them a way to solve this problem they've
created,'' Michelle Lawdaughter, a 1989 graduate, said before the
reversal. ``The mission of Mills College is to educate women.''
   Cathy Gildea, who graduated in 1987, said she talked to
``hundreds of alumnae, and we're committed to making (the rescue
plan) work.''
   She said the trustees were simply unaware of the resources that
existed among Mills alumnae and hadn't taken advantage of them to
keep Mills afloat as a women's school.
   The rescue plan includes adding $10 million to the college's
endowment and doubling the alumnae association's yearly gift to
Mills.
   Teachers voted by a 2-to-1 margin to ask Mills trustees to
reverse the move and allow five years to see if changes in
recruitment and curriculum could increase enrollment.
   Protests swept the campus of the elite liberal arts college
after the trustees' May 3 decision to begin admitting male
undergraduate students in fall 1991 to boost enrollment and
stabilize finances.
   When the decision by the board was announced, students, some
tearful, screamed ``No, no!'' and ``Traitors!''
   Hundreds of the school's 777 students took control of the campus
the next day, boycotting classes, blockading administrators'
offices, demanding Hellman's resignation, and staging a sit-in at
President Mary Metz's office.
   The switch to co-education had been under consideration for a
year, prompted by declining enrollment and revenues and a desire to
avoid dipping heavily into the school's $70 million endowment.
   The school said it needs to increase enrollment to 1,000 to help
balance the school's $24 million annual budget.
   Enrollment in Mills' 33 undergraduate programs is down 4.2
percent from three years ago. Yearly tuition at the school is
almost $12,000.
   Mills is the only single-sex undergraduate learning institution
in Northern California. Two women's colleges are located in
Southern California and 94 nationwide.
   The school has 264 graduate students, of which about 50 are men.
Federal laws mandate that graduate programs at all schools be open
to both sexes so Mills has instructed male graduates since the
1930s, a school official said.

   But the jury convicted Mondello, the alleged ringleader of the
white gang which killed a 16-year-old black youth, on lesser
charges of riot, unlawful imprisonment, discrmination, menacing and
criminal possession of a weapon.
   The most serious of the charges, riot and unalwful imprisonment,
carry jail terms of one and one-third to four years.
   The verdict was delivered in the 11th day of deliberations by
the Mondello panel. A day earlier, 19-year-old Joseph Fama was
convicted of second-degree murder by a jury which also deliberated
for 11 days.
   Fama faces 25 years to life on his conviction.

   The lead switched hands in Nebraska's
cliff-hanger Democratic primary for governor Friday as the last
absentee ballots gave Omaha lawyer Ben Nelson a 73-vote edge over
former political aide Bill Hoppner.
   Final, unofficial results showed Nelson with 44,585 votes or 27
percent and Hoppner, former aide to Sens. Jim Exon and Bob Kerrey,
with 44,512 votes, also 27 percent. The remaining votes were split
among five other candidates.
   The eventual winner will compete in November against Gov. Kay
Orr, the first Republican woman elected governor of any state. She
is seeking a second term.
   The State Board of Canvassers is scheduled to meet June 11 to
certify the results, based on official reports from each county. By
law it must order a recount if the margin between the two
front-runners is less than 1 percent of the leader's total. That is
now a virtual certainty.
   That recount would begin June 13. But Secretary of State Allen
Beermann said he had asked Attorney General Robert Spire to
determine whether it might start as early as May 30 _ in advance of
the board meeting _ if both Nelson and Hoppner requested it. Both
men have said they wanted the issue settled as quickly as possible.
   After the counting of votes was completed Tuesday, Hoppner held
a 94-vote lead. The lead see-sawed a half-dozen times between
Thursday and late Friday as more counties reported final absentee
returns.
   ``We definitely are hoping for the best, but we still have to be
guarded,'' said Nelson spokesman Sonny Foster. ``We've been through
so many disappointments over the last few days.''

   Hundreds of anti-Communist
demonstrators defied a ban on political rallies Friday and swore to
remain in central Bucharest until Romania has a government
untainted by links to Nicolae Ceausescu.
   ``Our round-the-clock protest will continue until we get our
liberty back, until democracy is restored in our country!'' protest
leader Dumitru Dinca shouted to demonstrators in downtown
University Square, Bucharest's main traffic artery.
   Thousands of protesters gathered on the square late Friday.
Close to midnight, those remaining jeered loudly at a
TV-screen-sized movie of interim President Ion Iliescu being shown
on the wall of a building on the square.
   Demonstrators have occupied the square since April 22, demanding
that Iliescu and other former Communists quit politics. Iliescu
became interim president after the overthrow and execution of
Communist dictator Ceausescu in December, and is heavily favored in
Sunday's presidential election.
   Iliescu had said the protesters should be ``cleaned out'' of the
square after the campaign officially closed Thursday. Campaigning
and political rallies are banned the last two days of the campaign.
   The turbulent and sometimes violent campaign officially ended
Thursday night with the first-ever televised debate by Iliescu and
his two opponents in the presidential race, Radu Campeanu and Ion
Ratiu.
   But Premier Petre Roman said the government decided to tolerate
the demonstrators' ``violation of the law'' for the time being.
   Hundreds of foreign observers are arriving to observe Romania's
first free election in 53 years.
   Several told reporters Friday evening they received reports of
irregularities in the election campaign and were investigating.
   ``No one has suggested ... that the election (campaign) has been
carried out without difficulty,'' said Roy Hattersley, a member of
the British Parliament. ``We can't tell the extent of the
problems.''
   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., told the news conference the
fairness of the election was the ``threshold question'' for U.S.
authorities considering the future of relations with Romania.
   Both men were part of a 60-member international delegation
sponsored by the U.S. Republican and Democratic parties' Institutes
for International Affairs.
   In Washington, the State Department revived charges that the
National Salvation Front, which has dominated Romanian politics
since December, engaged in violence and acts of intimidation
against the opposition in the campaign.
   Dinca said if the government had tried to oust the
demonstrators, ``it would have been with violence, because nobody
in the square would have left this sacred place.''
   ``Above our heads, and above their heads, a second revolution
would have burst out,'' he said.
   ``I prefer to stay here and face a bulldozer than a
dictatorship,'' said Dumitru Duduman, 30, a forestry worker who has
been living in one of the dozens of tents pitched around the square.
   The protest drew tens of thousands of people Thursday night. But
Iliescu and his National Salvation Front are heavy favorites in
Sunday's elections for president and a 506-seat, two-chamber
parliament.
   Polls of uncertain accuracy indicate that Iliescu, a 60-year-old
former Communist minister demoted after criticizing Ceausescu in
1971, is expected to get up to 60 percent of the vote.
   The Front expects a majority in parliament.
   In Timisoara, cradle of the revolution, a rally by more than
1,000 Front supporters was abandoned Thursday evening after
fighting broke out.
   Gheorghe Ilia, Front secretary in Timisoara, said opposition
supporters with clubs and knives attacked the rally and 15 people
were badly beaten.
   But Lumintia Lepugeanu, a spokeswoman for Campeanu's National
Liberal party, said Front supporters attacked opponents. She said
five people were hurt, none seriously.
   The conflicting reports were made by telephone to The Associated
Press in Bucharest.
   The electoral commission said Friday that 15.9 million Romanians
aged 18 or over are eligible to vote. For most, it will be the
first time they can elect their representatives.
   Candidate Campeanu, 66, is a former political prisoner whose
National Liberal Party draws most of its support from urban youth
and intellectuals and advocates of rapid privatization.
   Ratiu, 72, belongs to the National Peasants Party, which gets
most of its support from rural areas. He left Romania in 1940 and
returned after the revolution.

   It was a buoyant and even poetic
Helmut Kohl who came to the Palais Schaumburg on Friday for the
signing of a treaty to merge the economies of the two Germanys.
   It's no wonder Kohl was so openly happy, because the document
all but ensures the West German chancellor's place in history as
the man who choreographed the end of Germany's four-decade division.
   Kohl, a large man who's gregarious with friends but is a
lackluster orator, beamed throughout the ceremony inside the
opulent government-owned Palais Schaumburg. After finance ministers
signed the treaty, Kohl broke into a jubilant smile and started a
chorus of applause.
   He cheerfully posed for photographers and television camera
crews alongside Lothar de Maiziere, dwarfing the East German prime
minister.
   Members of the two Cabinets then went onto the palace terrace to
sip champagne and celebrate their accomplishment under brilliant
sunshine.
   Reporters tried to corner Kohl to ask when he thinks the first
all-German elections will occur. Kohl hinted earlier in the week
the elections could come at the end of the year.
   But Kohl adroitly evaded the question.
   ``We still have much work ahead of us in the two-plus-four
negotiations,'' said Kohl, referring to talks between the two
German nations and the four World War II victors on international
aspects of unification.
   He would only say that the date of elections ``is not far away.''
   Kohl then struck a surprisingly poetic tone to express his
belief that unification has always been a matter of destiny.
   ``There flows the Rhine,'' said Kohl, nodding toward the
legendary river streaming past the Palais Schaumburg.
   ``It streams along on its way, seeking the sea. Naturally, you
can stem its flow or make it detour, and that would create much
trouble on the river banks.
   ``But the water reaches the sea. And that's also how it is with
the current of German history,'' said Kohl.

   In his closing argument, Assistant District Attorney Paul Burns
said Mondello organized the white mob that stalked Hawkins and
three black friends, encircled Hawkins and left him dying on the
street after he was shot.
   ``Does one of these guys stick around to help Yusuf Hawkins?''
Burns asked. ``No. They all run. Like a mob they came, like a mob
they left. Group courage masking individual cowardice.''
   Hawkins was gunned down on a warm night last summer when he and
his friends went into the Bensonhurst neighborhood to look at a
used car. Mondello, Fama and other young men were on edge because
of rumors blacks were coming to a party in their neighborhood.
   Fama was convicted in the shooting of Hawkins but Friday's
verdict means that the other jury did not believe Mondello played a
role in the death of the young black man.
   Mondello, his hands crossed on the defense table, looked skyward
and began crying. After the final verdict was read, he hugged his
lawyer, Stephen Murphy, and thanked him.
   Minutes later he left the courtroom in tears, supported by his
mother Susan and his father.
   Two people were ejected from the courtroom for their outbursts
after the verdicts.
   ``I think Mr. Mondello is happy with the verdict,'' said Murphy.
``You just can't have a winner.''

<TEXT>
   A campaign ad for Gov. James Blanchard
that shows a white guard yelling at a black inmate at Michigan's
boot camp prison has been attacked by some critics as racist.
   The ad began airing Tuesday on stations in predominantly white
upstate areas and drew criticism from the campaign manager for
Senate Majority Leader John Engler. Engler is almost certain to win
the Republican nomination for governor. Blanchard, a Democrat, is
running for a third four-year term.
   Katie Wolf, deputy manager for Blanchard's re-election campaign,
said Friday that plans will proceed to begin broadcasting the ad
Saturday in predominantly black Detroit.
   The ad, designed to show that Blanchard is tough on crime, shows
young inmates at Michigan's boot camp prison. The ad starts with a
white guard dressing down a white inmate and closes with a white
guard yelling at a black inmate.
   Dr. Arthur Johnson, president of the Detroit branch of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, joined
some black lawmakers and other black leaders in saying the ad was
racist.
   He blasted it as ``stereotypical, unfavorable and harmful in the
treatment of African-Americans.''
   Joel Ferguson, a black Lansing businessman who was Michigan
campaign manager for Jesse Jackson's 1988 presidential campaign,
disagreed.
   ``To say the ad is racist is being overly sensitive,'' he said.
``The ad depicts what's actually happening in the boot camp. These
young offenders have committed serious crimes. It takes tough
discipline and hard work to turn them around.''

   The Bush administration is proposing new ideas
to solve several knotty issues holding up East-West agreement on
reducing conventional forces in Europe, Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney said Friday.
   But he said he didn't expect a sudden breakthrough in the
complex negotiations.
   Cheney, in an interview with AP Broadcast Services, confirmed
the proposals were taken to Moscow by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III.
   He gave no details about the proposals except to say they were
developed by himself, Gen. Colin Powell, who is chairman of the
joint chiefs, and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft.
   ``The conventional talks right now are complicated,'' he said.
``If you will, we have a sense the Soviets have slowed things
down.''
   Cheney was responding to a question about a report in the New
York Times that the United States had proposed to ``split the
difference'' on such problems areas as limits on the number of
tactical aircraft, one of the major sticking points in the Vienna
talks.
   The report said Baker was prepared to discuss a limit in the
range of 6,000 aircraft, a number higher than NATO had been willing
to accept.
   The negotiations involve North Atlantic Treaty Organization
countries as well as Warsaw Pact nations, 23 countries in all.
Although President Bush has expressed hope that a treaty would be
concluded this year, the pace of negotiations has lagged.
   In Moscow, a senior official in Baker's party, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the secretary had sent a letter to
NATO allies outlining the proposals, about which he declined to
give details.
   Negotiators for both sides are attempting to find equal ceilings
in main battle tanks, armored combat vehicles, artillery, troops,
combat aircraft and combat helicopters.
   Cheney said the negotiations were important to the
administration and ``offer the most significant increase in
stability'' for European nations because they could blunt the edge
in conventional forces enjoyed by the Warsaw Pact nations.
   ``So we'd like to wrap it up,'' Cheney said.
   However, he said that given the complex nature of the talks,
``it's more likely to take longer. I don't expect a quick or sudden
breakthrough.''
   Baker met in Moscow with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, with the goal of finding agreement on cutting U.S.
and Soviet long-range missiles, bombers and submarines in time for
Gorbachev's summit with Bush in Washington May 31-June 3.
   Baker agreed late Friday to hold more talks Saturday with
Shevardnadze and both said there had been progress.
   As pressure has grown for cuts in defense spending, one of the
most favored targets for U.S. and Western governments are the
costly forces and their equipment based in Europe.
   The Times reported that other possible compromises were to be
put forward on the maximum number of weapons any single nation
would be permitted, verification problems and the rate of
destruction for military equipment.
   The major sticking point in the talks have been the limits on
combat aircraft and verification, the problem of checking whether
arms control goals have been met or not.
   Cheney's remarks came as the United States and the NATO allies
tentatively agreed on a plan for sharing cuts in tanks, artillery
and other weapons expected in an East-West arms accord later this
year, an alliance source said in Brussels.
   Since late last year, representatives of the NATO nations have
been discussing how to distribute the reductions among themselves.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to
reveal the numbers roughed out for each country, but indicated the
United States would get the largest share.

   Alexander Dubcek of Czechoslovakia arrived in
Moscow on Friday on an official invitation 22 years after Soviet
tanks ousted him during the invasion of his country, Tass reported.
   Dubcek is now federal assembly president, one of three senior
officials in the democratically elected Czechoslovakian government.
   As leader of the Czechoslovakian Communist Party, he led the
``Prague Spring'' movement in 1968 and ran afoul of Soviet
hard-liners. They ordered Warsaw Pact forces to invade on Aug. 21,
1968.
   After the invasion crushed the reforms, Dubcek was hauled to
Moscow on orders of Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev. According to
reports from Prague, he was returned safely to Prague only with the
intervention of Ludvik Svoboda, then president of Czechoslovakia.
   Dubcek was to meet Saturday with Soviet Vice President Anatoly
I. Lukyanov and to lay a wreath Sunday at the grave of human rights
activist Andrei D. Sakharov, the official Tass news agency said.
   He is expected to return to Prague on Monday after a news
conference.

   A Mikhail Gorbachev ally who is a candidate for
president of the Russian republic called Friday for greater
autonomy from the Soviet Union.
   Alexander Vlasov, who is now premier of the largest Soviet
republic, said that ``radical resolution of the problems standing
before the republic can be found only in its full economic and
political sovereignty.''
   He is running against Boris N. Yeltsin, one of the country's
leading reformers, for the newly created post of chairman of the
Congress of the Russian Federation, popularly known as the Russian
president.
   Gorbachev is president of the Soviet Union, which includes 15
republics, including the secession-minded Baltic states of
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
   Yeltsin and other radicals have been urging greater
``sovereignty'' for Russia, a concept that falls well short of
secession. They argue that by securing greater control over the
Russian government, they can institute drastic reforms that have
been stalled at the national level.
   The three Baltic republics are trying to secede from the Soviet
Union. But Gorbachev wants to keep them within a proposed Soviet
confederation that would allow greater autonomy to the republics.
   Vlasov, a close ally of Gorbachev, called for Russian
``sovereignty'' in a ``state of the republic'' speech to the
Russian Congress.
   ``It is our position that everything on the Russian territory
should belong to the Russian people,'' Vlasov said.
   He said the Russian republic was not receiving an adequate share
of Soviet spending.
   Currently, the central government takes all income from state
businesses and allots money for operation of factories and cities.
The official Tass news agency said this week that 61 percent of the
profits from Russian businesses is distributed to other republics.
   Some radicals were critical of Vlasov's comments.
   ``In that stream of words, he said nothing concrete,'' said
Mikhail Bocharov, a legislator and factory manager who has led
Gorbachev's experiments with workers leasing their companies.
   In the national parliament, Gorbachev and his allies have
defeated proposals to transfer ownership of natural resources to
the republics. But the breakaway Baltic republics claimed them
anyway.
   Vlasov's comments followed a key vote Thursday, when more than
1,000 Russian legislators voted to move a discussion of sovereignty
high up on their agenda.
   Later during the congress, they are expected to demand a new
union treaty, which amounts to a renegotiation of the pact that
formally created the Soviet Union in 1922.
   Gorbachev endorsed the idea of a new union treaty nine months
ago. But like many of his domestic reforms, it remains only a vague
suggestion.

<HEAD>Iraqi Official Says Saddam Proposed Meeting With Rafsanjani</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq proposed
a summit meeting with Iran's President Hashemi Rafsanjani and got a
positive reply, Iraq's deputy prime minister confirmed in a
statement published Friday.
   The Saudi newspaper Al-Sharq Al-Awsat quoted the official, Taha
Yassin Ramadan, as saying the developments came in a recent
exchange of letters.
   The newspaper, circulated in Bahrain, quoted Ramadan as saying
no venue for such a summit was fixed, and that aides would hold
preliminary negotiations before Saddam and Rafsanjani meet to try
to settle their 10-year-old dispute.
   A cease-fire halted the 8-year Iran-Iraq war on Aug. 20, 1988.
European military analysts estimated 1 million people were killed
and 1.7 million wounded on both sides in the conflict. Negotiations
begun five days after the truce have been deadlocked, mainly over
the question of priorities.
   Iran wants immediate Iraqi withdrawal from lands occupied in the
final weeks of the war. Iraq wants the Shatt-al-Arab waterway,
which formed a boundary between Iran and Iraq, dredged of war
debris before moving on to other issues.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tareq Aziz disclosed earlier this month
that Saddam sent a letter to Rafsanjani calling for direct
negotiations between the two leaderships to solve pending problems.
He did not say if Saddam mentioned specifically a summit with his
foe.
   The official news media in Iran said the Iranian leadership was
giving Saddam's letter serious consideration. Baghdad and Tehran
have not divulged details of Saddam's letter or the reply from
Rafsanjani.
   Ramadan said of Saddam's letter: ``The truth about the contents
is that after two years of a cease-fire without any progress toward
a lasting peace ... there is no reason why we should complicate the
issue.
   ``We find that interest dictates there be a summit of the
presidents of the two countries to agree on the basic principles
for solving this problem since we are calling for peace and we
agree that (U.N. Security Council) Resolution 598 is the basis,''
Ramadan said.
   U.N. Resolution 598 calls for troop withdrawal to prewar
borders, exchange of prisoners, and negotiations toward a lasting
peace.
   Ramadan said the Iranian reply reached Baghdad a few days after
Saddam's message, ``and despite (our) reservations on many of the
points it contains, we shall reply ... that the meeting of the two
leaders be preceded by a meeting of their representatives.''
   He said ``consultations are under way'' on the venue, but would
not give other details. Arab press reports and diplomats in Baghdad
said Saddam suggested Moscow as site of the meeting.
   Persian Gulf press reports mentioned the Saudi city of Mecca,
Islam's holiest city, as a venue.
   However, Saudi-Iranian relations remain strained. Riyadh severed
ties with Tehran in April 1988, accusing Iranian leaders of
terrorism and subversion.

<HEAD>Bush Picks Shlaudeman for Managua Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush announced his intention Friday to
nominate veteran diplomat Harry Shlaudeman to be ambassador to
Nicaragua.
   Shlaudeman is a former ambassador to Brazil, Peru, Argentina and
Venezuela and also served as special negotiator for Central America
under President Reagan.
   The administration had originally intended to appoint the
ambassador to Mozambique, Melissa Wells, to serve in Managua but
officials said they were concerned about possible delays in the
Senate confirmation process.
   In 1986-87, Senate conservatives held up Ms. Wells' confirmation
as ambassador to Mozambique for 11 months.
   The officials, insisting on anonymity, said Shlaudeman is
expected to gain quick Senate confirmation. The administration
wants an ambassador in Managua without delay, partly because the
country is facing a difficult transition after 11 years of rule by
the leftist Sandinista government.
   The United States and Nicaragua have not had ambassadors in each
other's capital since July 1988, a reflection of the strain in
relations until President Daniel Ortega was replaced three weeks
ago by President Violeta Chamorro.
   Shlaudeman turned 64 on Thursday. He retired in 1989 but was
called back to the State Department during the latter part of the
year to serve as liaison with representatives of the Nicaraguan
Contras.

<HEAD>National Council Condemns Israeli Settlement Near Christian Holy
Site</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY BAIR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest ecumenical group on
Friday criticized the Israeli occupation of an east Jerusalem
shelter, a South African state visit and a U.S. Supreme Court
ruling limiting religious freedom.
   The National Council of Churches wrapped up a policy-making
meeting with a resolution asking Israeli leaders to remove Jewish
settlers from the Greek Orthodox shelter near the Church of the
Holy Sepulchre.
   ``The council ... deplores and condemns this state-sponsored
provocation and attack upon these historical understandings ...
that have served to preserve the peace of Jerusalem,'' the
resolution said.
   The resolution also criticized ``the brutal and aggressive
reactions of the Israeli police against the Christian and Muslim
leaders and laity.''
   About 150 Jewish settlers, backed by $1.8 million from the
Israeli government, moved into St. John's Hospice the week before
Easter. Israeli police later dispersed an anti-settlement
demonstration with tear gas and rubber bullets.
   The hospice is across the street from the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre, regarded as the burial site of Jesus Christ. Israel's
Supreme Court ordered the Jewish settlers out last month but said
it would allow 20 guards and maintenance staff to remain pending a
final ruling on the dispute.
   The church council, which represents most major Anglican,
Orthodox and Protestant religions, comprises 32 denominations with
42 million members.
   At the meeting, the council also endorsed the June 20 visit to
the United States of South African anti-apartheid leader Nelson
Mandela. It said, however, the White House shouldn't welcome South
African President F.W. de Klerk as long as apartheid remains in
effect.
   ``I am concerned that any signal of support of de Klerk will
send the African National Congress a message we are backing away
from our call for the dismantling of apartheid,'' said the Rev.
Tyrone Pitts of the Progressive National Baptist Convention.
   The council also criticized an April U.S. Supreme Court decision
that said drug use as part of religious rituals isn't protected by
constitutionally guaranteed religious freedoms.
   The court said said Oregon could deny jobless benefits to
American Indians who used peyote in a religious ritual and allowed
convictions of people who break laws while following their
religious beliefs, said Dean Kelley, the council's director of
religious liberty.
   ``The council urges its member communions to alert their
constituents to this incredible loss of protection for religious
rights because of an aggressive and radical exercise in of judicial
activism,'' the resolution said.
   Council members late Thursday asked Nestle Foods Corp., General
Foods Corp. and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. to stop buying coffee beans
from El Salvador, where six Jesuit priests were killed last year.
Nine Salvadoran soldiers are awaiting trials in the killings of the
priests, their maid and her daughter.
   The church council also asked the Defense Department to withdraw
troops and close bases in the Philippines by 1996.
   It recognized the upcoming 500th anniversary of Christopher
Columbus' arrival in the Americas by noting the slavery of blacks
and mistreatment of American Indians during the five centuries
since.
   The board passed a resolution that was a compromise between
those who wanted to celebrate Columbus Day and those who see it as
an occasion to reflect on past wrongs. The board approved several
amendments denouncing slavery and the mistreatment of Indians since
Columbus' fleet reached Caribbean islands in 1492.

<HEAD>Judge Finds Father Guilty in Acid-Poisoning of Baby</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man accused of poisoning his infant son
with sulfuric acid as part of a plot to sue a baby formula
manufacturer was found guilty Friday of first-degree murder and
could face the death penalty.
   Attorneys for Ricky Irby Sr., 29, blamed the child's mother, but
Lake County Associate Judge Harry Hartel, who presided over the
non-jury trial, said Irby's ``demeanor led me to believe he did not
testify truthfully.''
   ``It's a despicable crime _ a mother and father putting a price
tag on their baby,'' Assistant State's Attorney Victoria Rossetti
said after hearing the verdict.
   Irby and the baby's mother, Sheila Smith, were charged with
murder in the death of the child, Quinten.
   Ms. Smith already has pleaded guilty in return for a 20- to
65-year prison sentence.
   The baby was hospitalized for 27 months at Children's Memorial
Hospital in Chicago after being force-fed sulfuric acid May 31,
1984. He was 3 months old at the time and died Aug. 26, 1986.
   Ms. Rossetti said sentencing possibilities include the death
penalty, life in prison, or 20 to 80 years imprisonment. A
sentencing hearing was scheduled to begin June 29.
   An appeal of the conviction was expected, she said.
   Ms. Smith called for a rescue squad after she said she found
Quinten vomiting.
   Irby met Ms. Smith at St. Therese Medical Center in Waukegan and
when a nurse told him the baby had injuries to his mouth, his
immediate response was: ``It had to be the formula. I'm going to
sue Abbott Laboratories,'' prosecutors said.
   An Abbott subsidiary manufactures Similac baby formula.
   Ms. Rossetti called the verdict ``a victory for Quinten because
nobody else thought about him.''
   ``He suffered vision and hearing loss, became mentally retarded,
underwent 19 medical procedures in a year to clear his airways
before having to have a lung removed,'' she said. ``All the
suffering was because his father wanted money the easy way, the
quick way.''

<HEAD>U.N. Pays $150,000 to Print Rights Reports on Israel's Critics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Israeli Mission said Friday the United
Nations paid $150,000 to print and distribute copies of U.S. human
rights reports on nations that have denounced Israel's practices in
the occupied territories.
   Israel requested the publication, but described it as a waste of
money.
   It blamed the Palestinian rights' committee _ the U.N. Committee
on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People
_ for provoking the costly publication by the world body, which is
hard-pressed for money.
   For years, the committee has published the annual U.S. State
Department report on human rights, covering what it calls Israel's
abuses in the occupied territories _ the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip, captured by Israel from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   In retaliation this year, Israel asked the United Nations to
publish similar State Department reports on committee members and
members of the Arab League that have criticized Israel.
   Israel said these reports show the hypocrisy of its critics, who
have abysmal human rights records, according to the State
Department.
   Israeli offices noted that among its critics, Cuba and Saudi
Arabia make it a crime punishable by death to propagate Zionist
ideas.
   The committee has 23 members and Israel has published reports on
members and other critics, including: Afghanistan, Bahrain,
Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Cuba, Iraq, Libya, Laos, Malaysia, Mali,
Mauritania, Pakistan, Saudia Arabia, Senegal, Somalia and Syria.
   Under U.N. guidelines, any member or U.N. body may request the
organization to translate, print and distribute statements or
reports in six official languages _ Arabic, English, Chinese,
French, Russian and Spanish.
   Israeli Mission spokesman Yuval Rotem said, ``We warned the
United Nations in advance that this would be a costly exercise and
we hoped the Palestinian committee would not distribute again this
year the human rights report on the Occupied Territories.
   ``We are going to use the very same coin they use, namely the
human rights report on the territories ... None of our critics has
a better record (than Israel's).''
   Ambassador Absa Claude Diallo of Senegal, chairman of the
committee, was not immediately available for comment. But Arab
diplomats blamed Israel for any waste of money and said it was
trying to deflect attention from its own problems in the occupied
lands and to derail criticism.
   Both the General Assembly and Security Council have denounced
Israel's harsh handling of the continuing Palestinian uprising that
began on Dec. 8, 1987, in the occupied territories.
   Palestinian officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the $150,000 price tag and agreed it was a waste.
   ``We were waiting for the price tag to reach $250,000 before we
complained,'' said a diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.

   Nelson Mandela met Friday with Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi in that country's capital of Tripoli, the Egyptian
state-owned Middle East News Agency reported.
   Quoting official Tripoli Radio, the agency said the black
nationalist leader arrived earlier in the day from Algeria for a
one-day visit.
   However, it did not elaborate on his talks with Gadhafi.
   Mandela was scheduled to arrive in Cairo on Saturday for a
three-day visit.
   The black leader is vice president of the African National
Congress, the leading group fighting the South African system of
racial separation known as apartheid.
   President F.W. de Klerk of South Africa released Mandela from
prison in February and announced other racial reforms. Mandela had
been imprisoned since 1962 on a life sentence for sabotage and
plotting to overthrow the white-led government.

   The black miners' union agreed
Friday to work with its white counterpart to ease racial tension
following a clash this week that left two people dead and 14

   The black National Union of Mineworkers and the white Mine
Workers Union held four hours of discussions. Also attending were
Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and officials from the
Anglo-American Corp., the country's largest mining company.
   Cyril Ramaphosa, general secretary of the black union, said all
parties at the talks agreed to establish a forum to discuss
grievances.
   The meeting took place in Welkom, site of a racial fight
Wednesday at a gold mine that left two whites dead and 14 blacks
injured.
   Welkom, 170 miles south of Johannesburg, has been the scene of
repeated confrontations between blacks and right-wing whites in
recent weeks.
   The whites have formed paramilitary groups, while blacks have
been boycotting white-owned businesses for almost two weeks.
   White and black leaders fear the growing threat of violence by
extreme right-wingers could hamper political reform. President F.W.
de Klerk is trying to prepare for negotiations on a new
constitution to bring blacks into the political system, but he
faces a growing backlash from conservative whites.

   Jill Ireland, the British actress whose
six-year battle against breast cancer made her a model of strength
and determination, died Friday of the disease. She was 54.
   Miss Ireland, the wife of her frequent action movie co-star
Charles Bronson, was with the actor and several of her children
when she died at her hillside home at 11:30 a.m., said her
publicist, Lori Jonas.
   Though she appeared in many movies and starred in the TV series
``Shane,'' she was better known for her highly visible work on
behalf of cancer sufferers. In two books and frequent lectures on
her battle with the disease, Miss Ireland spoke eloquently about
self-respect and optimism in the face of devastating illness. She
called herself a survivor, rather than a victim.
   ``I don't want to die,'' Miss Ireland said in early 1989. `` ...
Not right now. We all die one day, but I am not in the mood to do
it yet.''
   The actress, who appeared in such movies as ``The Mechanic'' and
``Death Wish II,'' first underwent surgery to remove a cancerous
right breast and eight lymph nodes under her arm in 1984. After a
brief remission, the cancer spread to her lungs.
   In April 1989, Miss Ireland began feeling pain in her shoulder.
She was diagnosed with cancer that had spread to her lungs, hip,
femur and thyroid.
   When she took a turn for the worse Sunday, paramedics were
called to the house and treated her, but didn't take her to the
hospital.
   ``She'll be remembered as being a tremendous woman, but she was
also funny, sexy, witty and a great mother,'' said friend Joan
Rivers. She said Miss Ireland never complained about her health.
   Miss Ireland's life was filled with calamity. Jason McCallum,
the son she adopted with first husband David McCallum of ``The Man
From U.N.C.L.E.'' fame, was a longtime drug abuser who died in
November at age 27 of a drug mixture both injected and ingested. He
was to have been married a few days later.
   The actress wrote about fighting breast cancer in the
best-seller ``Life Wish.'' At the time of her death she was
completing a third book, ``Life Times,'' which profiled some of her
friends.
   Last month, she accepted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame,
beaming though obviously ill and wearing a wig because she'd lost
her hair from cancer therapy. ``This is really quite a thrill,''
she said in a hoarse voice.
   As recently as two weeks ago, she managed to attend the wedding
of her son, Paul McCallum. She had pledged to live to see him marry.
   Miss Ireland received the Medal of Courage from President
Reagan, the Betty Ford Award from the Susan Komen Foundation and
was a crusade chairman for the American Cancer Society.
   She testified in Washington for the inclusion of mammography for
women on Medicare.
   ``That's a voice the American Cancer Society could ill afford to
lose,'' Allan Jonas, past chairman of the group's board of
directors, said Friday.
   Miss Ireland, the oldest of a grocery store manager's two
children, grew up in a London suburb. Her mother was a dance and
music devotee who enrolled her daughter in ballet school when she
was only 4.
   She went on to appear with the Monte Carlo Ballet. At age 18,
she performed a solo in the movie ``Oh, Rosalinda,'' leading to a
film contract with Britain's Rank Organization.
   It was there that she met David McCallum, with whom she had two
sons and adopted Jason McCallum.
   She met Charles Bronson in 1962 during filming of ``The Great
Escape,'' divorced McCallum in 1967 and married Bronson a year
later.
   The couple had a daughter and adopted another girl. They had
custody of Miss Ireland's three sons, as well as Bronson's son and
daughter by a previous marriage.
   In addition to ``Death Wish II'' and ``The Mechanic,'' Miss
Ireland and Bronson acted together in such films as ``The Valachi
Papers,'' ``Breakheart Pass,'' and ``Love and Bullets.'' She also
co-produced his film, ``Murphy's Law.''
   Yet her writing, not her acting, had the most impact.
   In an essay Life magazine's June issue, Miss Ireland described
the funeral she wants: ``A real wake, with balloons, champagne,
everyone in bright, happy colors, lots of food and music. A fiesta.
A celebration of my life ...''
   In addition to Charles Bronson, survivors included parents
Dorothy and Jack Ireland, brother John, sons Tony Bronson, Paul and
Valentine McCallum, and daughters Zuleika Bronson, Katrina Holden
and Susan Bronson.
   Funeral arrangements weren't immediately announced.

<TEXT>
   The threat of invasion by Napoleon
Bonaparte has faded so a 130-year-old island fort off south England
that was built to deter the French has been transformed into a
luxury home and put up for sale.
   The real estate company of Knight Frank and Rutley said Friday
that the seller, developer Roger Penfold, is asking $9.7 million
for the property, called No Man's Land Fort.
   The fort is three miles off Portsmouth, in the Solent seaway
between the coast and the Isle of Wight, 70 miles southwest of
London.
   The fort, measuring three-quarters of an acre, was built to
house 400 soldiers and 49 guns each weighing 70 tons. Construction
began in 1860.
   It was designed as part of south coast defenses against the
threat of invasion across the English Channel by the French under
Emperor Bonaparte.
   The invasion never materialized and the circular, armor-plated
stone fort fell into disuse and dereliction.
   Penfold, 44, bought it from the Ministry of Defense for an
estimated $507,000 in 1986 and spent 2{ years converting it into a
luxury home.
   The walls are 23 feet thick and stand 60 feet above the waves.
Each of the armored iron plates that clad the outside measures 100
square feet and weighs 18 tons.
   The renovated property has modern living quarters and its own
built-in lighthouse, helicopter landing pad, swimming pool,
gymnasium and tennis court. The asking price includes a helicopter,
service boats, a butler and six other domestic staff.
   The real estate company described the fort as ``the ultimate in
luxurious island homes.''

   Christian Brando, son of actor Marlon Brando,
pleaded innocent Friday to first-degree murder in the Wednesday
night shooting death of his pregnant half-sister's boyfriend.
   Municipal Judge Rosemary Shumsky ordered Brando, 32, held
without bail, denying a plea from his attorneys that a bail hearing
be held immediately.
   The prosecutor said he wasn't ready to argue bail, and Shumsky
agreed to hold the hearing Tuesday.
   Brando, handcuffed, unshaven and clad in a grey shirt and jeans,
was glum and looked down at the floor through most of the hearing.
The self-employed artist and welder spoke only twice to say
``yes,'' when asked if he understood his right to a speedy
preliminary hearing and whether he was willing to waive that right.
   Shumsky set June 11 to schedule a preliminary hearing.
   Famed civil rights lawyer William Kunstler appeared at Brando's
side along with two other attorneys, but Kunstler left the legal
arguments to local attorney Dan Stormer.
   In addition to the murder count, Brando pleaded innocent to
possession of a machine gun and a silencer found following the
shooting in the den of Marlon Brando's home. The weapons weren't
used in the shooting, authorities said.
   Christian Brando is charged in the death of Dag Drollet, 26, a
guest at the home and the son of a Tahitian official.
   Drollet reportedly was the father of 20-year-old Tarita Cheyenne
Brando's unborn child. Police said the shooting apparently was
sparked by an argument over Drollet's treatment of Miss Brando, and
said there were allegations Drollet had beaten the young woman.
   Outside the courtroom Kunstler said he had discovered from the
police report that the gun apparently went off accidentally during
a struggle.
   ``This is not murder by any means,'' the attorney said.
   But police Detective Steve Osti said earlier there was no
indication there had been a struggle before the shooting. Christian
Brando and Drollet were alone at the time.
   An autopsy Friday determined that Drollet died of a gunshot
wound to the head and neck, said coroner's office spokesman Bob
Dambacher.
   Kunstler said Marlon Brando, 66, has been very supportive of his
son, and was willing to take the stand and testify if necessary.
   ``He's going to do whatever any father would do,'' the attorney
said. He said Marlon Brando had told his son to be strong.
   The Oscar-winning actor was in another part of the estate when
the shooting occurred, and was the one who called police.
   The small courtroom was jammed to capacity with reporters,
photographers and television crews, and the clicking of cameras and
the pop of flashbulbs punctuated the brief session.
   Marlon Brando didn't attend the hearing, but Christian Brando's
former wife, Mary McKenna Brando, was in the courtroom.
   Kunstler said Marlon Brando called him Thursday, asking him to
represent his son. The two men are longtime friends and allies in
civil rights struggles over the past 30 years.
   Christian Brando is the son of the actor and his first wife,
Anna Kashfi. The couple was divorced in 1960, and their troubled
son was the subject of a bitter custody battle.
   Tarita Cheyenne is the daughter of Brando and his current wife,
Tarita Teriipia, a Tahitian actress who played his love in the 1962
remake of ``Mutiny on the Bounty.''

   A NATO ambassador from Luxembourg who resigned
over charges he passed a secret paper to a Soviet citizen denied
Friday he had breached security rules.
   Guy de Muyser, who remains ambassador to Belgium, was speaking
in parliament during a committee session that give him his first
opportunity to formally defend himself since he was forced to
resign April 25.
   He denied all the charges against him during the 2{-hour hearing
before the foreign affairs and defense committees of the Luxembourg
parliament.
   The government withdrew his NATO security clearance after NATO
and Luxembourg security services alleged he had traveled to the
Soviet Union without authorization and handed a secret NATO
document to a Soviet citizen.
   De Muyser, who served as Luxembourg ambassador to the Soviet
Union in the early 80s, said he returned once to the Soviet Union
in 1986, but only after informing NATO authorities.
   He acknowledged giving a NATO document to a Soviet citizen in
Brussels, Belgium. But he said it was not a secret paper.
   Luxembourg traditionally combines the diplomatic missions to the
Western military alliance and to Belgium. NATO has its headquarters
in Brussels.

   A nearly retarded man who killed twice as a
teen-ager went quietly to his death in Louisiana's electric chair
early Friday in an execution that worldwide protests couldn't stop.
   Dalton Prejean, 30, became the first murderer to die under the
U.S. Supreme Court's 1989 ruling that allowed the death penalty for
crimes committed by 16- and 17-year olds.
   Amnesty International, the European Parliament, the American
Civil Liberties Union and numerous other civil rights organizations
denounced the electrocution. Gov. Buddy Roemer received 206
telephone calls urging him to call off the sentence, and 129
supporting the execution, his office said.
   Just before the execution, Prejean said his death would serve no
purpose.
   ``One mistake ... 13 years ago, and that's a long time,'' he
said during a rambling, barely audible final statement. ``Nothing
is going to be accomplished. I have peace with myself.''
   Prejean was put to death for the 1977 murder of state trooper
Donald Cleveland, who was killed during a traffic stop in
Lafayette. Prejean was 17 then and had served more than two years
in reform school for killing a taxi driver when he was 14.
   A black man, he was convicted of killing a white man by an
all-white jury, a factor that led to charges of racism by capital
punishment opponents.
   His supporters also argued he had suffered brain damage as a
child, apparently at the hands of an abusive aunt. His IQ of 71 was
just above what would be considered mentally retarded. And his age
at the time of his crime was another reason for mercy, they said.
   ``I doubt that in documented recent world history there is an
execution ... that has such a pile of reasons not to do it,'' said
Steve Herrick, southern regional director for Amnesty International.
   Roemer was unmoved. He already had rejected a 3-2 recommendation
of his pardon board to commute the sentence to life in prison.
Repeatedly in recent months he had noted the trooper was killed in
cold blood by a gunshot to the face.
   ``I'm never happy with these things, but I do not, as a
representative of the people, have a choice,'' Roemer said.
   Anti-death penalty demonstrations were held Thursday at the
Capitol and at the governor's mansion in Baton Rouge. At the prison
gates in Angola, however, about 10 pro-execution demonstrators held
a quiet, late-night vigil.
   Several were relatives of murder victims.
   ``We've come to every electrocution since 1984, when our
daughter was murdered,'' said Johnny Reece, of Pineville.
   Prejean's final Supreme Court appeal was rejected about 7 p.m.
Thursday.
   He had been on Louisiana's death row for 10 years, longer than
any other inmate, and had been turned down by the U.S. Supreme
Court four times.
   About 12:05 a.m., four guards escorted him into the freshly
painted yellow cinder-block death chamber.
   Witnesses watched from behind a glass window as the soft-voiced
Prejean spoke for about three minutes on what was about to happen.
   Some of his remarks were about Cleveland's widow and children,
to whom he expressed remorse for his crime.
   ``To the Cleveland family, they say it wasn't for the revenge,
but it's hard for me to see, to understand,'' Prejean said. ``I
hope they're happy.''
   The execution was the nation's third in 24 hours. Texas and
Missouri each executed killers early Thursday. Since capital
punishment resumed in 1977, 128 prisoners have been executed in the
nation, 19 in Louisiana.

   As soon as word spread Friday that Keith
Mondello was innocent of killing Yusuf Hawkins, electrified
Bensonhurst residents surged from their homes onto the block where
Mondello lived and Hawkins died.
   ``Yeah, give me five, pops,'' one man said as he leapt into the
air and exchanged double high fives with a gray-haired resident.
Later the held red, white and blue balloons for others to sign as a
victory present for Mondello.
   Asked his name, the balloon-holder said: ``Just put down
Bensonhurst, that's what we are.''
   People smiled or cried, couples hugged and cars rode through
with blaring horns, driving shaking their fists.
   Mondello was acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges in the
slaying of Hawkins, a black 16-year-old who went to Bensonhurst to
look at a used car.
   The alleged ringleader of the white gang, Mondello was convicted
on lesser charges of riot, unlawful imprisonment, discrimination,
menacing and criminal possession of a weapon.
   On Thursday, Joseph Fama, 19, was convicted of second-degree
murder.
   After that ruling, Bensonhurst residents were defensive and
mostly unwilling to talk to the media about Fama, who they
described as a good kid.
   After Friday's verdict clearing Mondello of the most serious
charges against him, neighbor Jim League was jubilant.
   `I'm happy that justice has been served. Justice was served
yesterday and it's served again today,'' said League, 37.
   ``Yesterday in East New York, they must have been bubbling over
for the system,'' League added, referring to the predominantly
black neighborhood where Hawkins lived. ``Today, we are bubbling
over.
   ``There is justice for all. I feel like I am singing.''
   Maria Gonzalez, 25, standing in the doorway of a laundry as the
celebration rushed by her, said Mondello was ``going to have that
on his conscience the rest of his life. So are all of them.''
   Neighborhood attitudes are writ large in the graffiti of romance
and racism.
   Subway station walls bore the chronicles of love past: Robert
'n' Kim, 5-10-87; Jimmy 'n' Diane, 9-27-83; Anthony 'n' Rita,
6-8-86.
   And freshly painted in black on a building at 20th Avenue and
70th Street, these words: No Nigger Zone.
   This was were Mondello and Gina Feliciano had dated and
quarreled, and where Hawkins had walked to his death, thinking he
was going to look at that used car.
   Instead, he ran into a group of whites looking for outsiders.
Prosecutors said Mondello assembled the white mob because he feared
black and Hispanic friends of Miss Feliciano were coming to beat
him up.
   Fama was among the crowd _ youths wielding baseball bats and
carrying at least one gun _ which chased, trapped and fatally shot
Hawkins.
   At Franklin D. Roosevelt High School, 17-year-old Anthony
Nardulli said most of the students agreed with the Fama jury.
   ``It was good,'' he said of Thursday's verdict. ``There are bad
Italians and good Italians. I'm upset. Everybody's upset about what
happened.''
   Although Bensonhurst is known as an Italian enclave, all sorts
of people _ Asians, Hispanics, blacks _ work on its commercial
streets. For the most part, they appear to get along.
   It's an informal place, where clothing hangs on lines between
some of the two- and three-story brick houses and people shout out
their windows. Bensonhurst, in fact, helped inspire ``The
Honeymooners.''
   But along 20th Avenue, where Hawkins was shot to death, the mood
was grim Thursday.
   ``Nobody really knows the real story'' of the Hawkins killing,
said Justine Doz, 19, who works at the Gondola Bake Shop. But, she
added, ``They killed a kid, and somebody has to pay for that.''
   She admitted, however, that many of her customers insisted Fama
did not get a fair trial.
   There were those in Bensonhurst hoping for an end to a case that
has made their community's name synonymous with urban bigotry and
violence.
   Asked about the case, one woman simply said, ``Let it die.''

   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over sections of the
Midwest, the West and the Northeast on Friday as flooding continued
in southern and Midwestern states.
   An unusual thin layer of dust extended over western Pennsylvania
and West Virginia after being carred almost 1,000 miles from a
storm over western Quebec, Canada.
   Overnight frost and freezing weather chilled parts of the
northern Plains and northwest Minnesota, breaking low-temperature
records up to 75 years old.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms fell over sections of
Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas, Texas, southern New England,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, the Dakotas and Utah. Scattered
rain fell in Montana and Maine.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included nearly an inch at Joplin, Mo., and about half an inch in
Tulsa, Okla.
   Floods triggered by earlier rains continued in parts of Texas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas,
Illinois and Indiana. Flooding was also reported in Georgia,
Tennessee, New Jersey, Ohio, Michigan and Minnesota.
   The National Weather Service predicted that some rivers would
not fall below flood stage before the middle of the next week.
   Advisories for gusty winds were posted in parts of Arizona, and
winds gusted to 50 mph near Falgstaff.
   Saturday's forecast held rain and lower temperatures for Oregon
and Northern California.
   Temperatures in North Dakota on Friday dropped to 27 degrees in
Fargo, snapping the record of 29 degrees set in 1929, and to 28
degrees in Jamestown, where the old record of 29 degrees had stood
since 1915.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 39
degrees in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., to 95 degrees in Fort Myers,
Fla.
   The low temperature for the nation was 20 degrees in Truckee,

   President Bush told Hungary's acting president on
Friday that he will press Soviet Leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev on
Soviet troop reductions in Europe but that some U.S. forces should
remain as a guarantee of stability.
   Withdrawal of Soviet troops is ``something we want to continue
to discuss with the Soviets to make sure their position hasn't
changed on exactly what their intentions are,'' presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters aboard Air Force One en
route from Washington to Dallas
   ``The president's position is that you shouldn't have any
foreign troops where they aren't wanted,'' Fitzwater added.
   Bush met with acting Hungarian President Arpad Goncz at the
White House before embarking on a four-day speaking trip. His first
stop was a Republican fundraiser in Dallas for gubernatorial
candidate Clayton Williams and other GOP candidates.
   Fitzwater said that Bush was awaiting word from Secretary of
State James A. Baker III, who has been discussing arms control
issues in Moscow with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
and President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Earlier, in Washington, Goncz told reporters that Bush told him
that the issue of Soviet troop withdrawals would come up at the May
31-June 3 superpower summit.
   ``We are in full agreeement that the Soviet troop withdrawal
from Czechoslovakia, Hungary and other countries of the region
should proceed,'' Goncz said.
   Hungary and Czechoslovakia, through they have overthrown
Communist governments, are still allies of the Soviet Union in the
Warsaw Pact. The Soviets have been pulling troops home from their
stations in Warsaw Pact countries. Not all allies want a complete
withdrawal, though some do.
   Poland, for instance, has said Soviet troops should stay there
for a while as a counterweight to a stronger Germany
   A White House statement on the meeting said Bush told Goncz that
the United States would maintain a ``strong presence'' in Western
Europe, including a military presence, as ``a guarantee of
stability.''
   Goncz said that Bush sought his views on Moscow's standoff with
secessionist Lithuania and other rebellious Baltic states.'' He
said he told Bush, ``the unfolding processes in the Baltic states
simply cannot be reversed any more. I'm proceeding from our
experiences which we've been through in Hungary.''
   Fitzwater, in his comments aboard Air Force One, said the
administration was encouraged by Gorbachev's meeting with
Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene. ``That's an
encouraging sign. The president's been urging dialogue,'' Fitzwater
said.
   Bush was to discuss the upcoming summit and East-West relations
at a commencement address on Saturday at the University of Texas in
Austin.
   Bush's speech to the GOP fundraiser _ one of a series of
political appearances he has been making this year in behalf of
Republican candidates, was expected to raise up to $1.5 million,
Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman said that 1990 census estimates suggest that Texas
will add three congressional seats to the 27 it now holds, and that
Bush wants to help raise funds to help the GOP ticket as
redistricting approaches.
   Bush told the GOP fundraiser that ``we have to win in 1990.''
   ``If we don't, once again the opposition will gerrymander fair
representation right out the window and into thin air,'' he said in
prepared remarks.
   Bush told his GOP audience he and his wife Barbara were
astounded when they caught a glimpse of the flood-swollen Trinity
River on their way into Dallas ``and could only see the tops of
some trees.''
   The president rearranged his schedule and planned to tour some
of the hardest hit flood-damaged areas near Houston on Saturday
morning.
   ``In this terrible disaster, the losses have been heavy...But
one thing this state will never lose, and that is its soul,'' Bush
said of his adopted home state.
   The president had declared 37 Texas countries as disaster areas,
and more declarations are expected.
   Fitzwater, in a written statement, said Bush and Goncz ``agreed
on the need for opening a process of dialogue between the Soviet
and Lithuanian leaders as a prerequisite for creating a stable
environment in which the countries of Central and Eastern Europe
can consolidate their democratic reforms.''
   ``President Bush also stressed the importance of maintaining a
strong U.S. presence as a guarantee of stability,'' Fitzwater said.
   Goncz said he asked Bush's ``assistance in encouraging Mr.
Gorbachev at the summit to keep the set deadline of Soviet troop
withdrawals from Hungary.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Friday it was his impression
that the Soviets had stopped withdrawing troops from East Germany
as they've placed more emphasis on withdrawing troops from Hungary
and Czechoslovakia, possibly because of housing or transportation
problems in the Soviet Union.
   In his discussion with Bush, Goncz said he asked the United
States for additional aid and support, but did not name a price tag.
   ``We are not coming here to beg,'' he said.
   Only about $20 million of a $900 million U.S. package of aid for
Poland and other emerging Eastern European democracies is earmarked
for Hungary.
   On his trip to Texas and the West Coast, Bush will take part in
Saturday's Doug Sanders celebrity pro-am golf tournament in Houston
before giving the commencement address at the University of Texas
in Austin.
   Bush will be in Portland, Ore., on Sunday and Monday and finish
his trip in Los Angeles.

   First-grade readers of Little Red
Riding Hood have more to fear than the Big Bad Wolf, say school
officials. It's the wine she has in her basket.
   An award-winning adaptation of the classic Grimm's fairy tale
has been pulled from the youngsters' recommended supplemental
reading list because the heroine has wine in the basket of goodies
she brings her ailing grandmother.
   ``It gives the younger ones the wrong impression about alcohol.
If they should refrain, why give them a story saying it's OK?''
said Vera Jashni, assistant superintendent for instruction.
   ``I don't think the basket of wine is a good concept for
kindergarten or first grade,'' said school board member Robert
Knopf. He said he would rather have seen ``a nice thing like
cookies and cakes or a picnic basket with food in it.''
   Ms. Jashni, who ordered the ban, said it was the final paragraph
of the story that sealed her decision _ the part after the woodsman
kills the Big Bad Wolf.
   ``The grandmother drank some of the wine, and ... after a while,
the grandmother felt quite strong and healthy, and began to clean
up the mess that the wolf had left in the cottage.''
   The version of the story, written by Trina Schart Hyman, won a
Caldicott Honor Award for children's literature.
   Houghton-Mifflin Co., a Boston-based textbook publisher,
distributed it as part of a 10-book package, and California
education authorities placed it on the state's recommended
supplemental reading list for 5- and 6-year-olds.
   Knopf said it is the only book the Culver City school board has
pulled.
   Houghton-Mifflin spokesman Sandy Caswell said the ban was
incomprehensible.
   ``The fact that it's an award-winning book, and one we felt was
a good retelling of the story, led us to select it as part of the
reading series,'' he said. Caswell added the company had received
complaints about the book from three other school districts, all of
them in California.
   Gina Grawe, a teacher at Linwood Howe Elementary School,
organized a daylong protest last week over the ban. Teachers showed
support by wearing pictures of Little Red on their shoulders.
   ``Is this the beginning of book-banning? One person should not
have that much control to make that decision,'' Ms. Grawe said.
``I'm sure someone could find something objectionable in any book _
there's drinking in Tom Sawyer.''

   The Contra guerrillas said they
stopped disarming Friday and cited an ``atmosphere of uncertainty
and social instability'' provoked by the Sandinistas, who turned
over power last month to Nicaragua's new, U.S.-backed government.
   In a communique signed by Contra chief of staff Israel Galeano,
the rebels asked for new talks on disarmament accords.
   The announcement by the Nicaraguan Resistance came as the
National Assembly was debating proposals by President Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro's government to alter or suspend laws passed by
the leftist Sandinista government before it stepped down on April
25.
   Her efforts to make similar changes by presidential decree led
to a strike by government workers that paralyzed her administration
earlier this week.
   The estimated 11,000 Contra fighters had agreed to lay down
their weapons by June 10 after spending years trying to oust the
government of former President Daniel Ortega, with U.S. support.
   Galeano complained that promises under the agreements were not
being met. The basic accord for the Contras to disarm and
demobilize was signed on March 23. Galeano did not sign that
agreement, but he did sign one on April 5.
   Rebels in security zones began disarming May 8.
   Galeano on Friday accused the Sandinistas of acting with
``vengeance, frustration and rancor'' and said they were trying to
``sabotage and frustrate the first measures of reconciliation,
democratization and demilitarization.''
   He complained that wounded and crippled Contras were not getting
proper care; that two demobilized Contras were beaten when they
tried to return home; that Sandinista troops had not completely
evacuated Contra security zones and that Sandinista sympathizers
had not been disarmed, and that demobilized Contras were not
getting enough food.
   Only about 1,000 of the fighters had actually laid down their
weapons as of Thursday, and many of the weapons turned in were old.
   Luis Sanchez, an official of Mrs. Chamorro's coalition and first
vice president of the National Assembly, said the Contra
announcement, like the Sandinista-led strikes, was not surprising.
   ``This is a result of the terrible damage done by 10 years of
war to the national conscience,'' Sanchez said. ``Nobody trusts
anybody.''
   He asked the Sandinistas, who came to power in 1979, to halt
actions that undermine the government and asked the Contras to
observe the disarmament accords.
   Sanchez said the government had no advance word of the Contra
decision before it was read over Radio Nicaragua, the government
station, Friday.
   Former Vice President Sergio Ramirez, leader of the Sandinista
delegation in the National Assembly, said the disarmament accords
could not be changed.
   ``It would be extremely serious to open a new stage of
negotiations to go over this matter, which should be closed,'' he
said.
   He said Contra disarmament must be completed by June 10
``exactly as established in the accords.''
   Ramirez said to change the accords in any way ``would be to
renew uncertainty, to open the perspective of more pain, more
death, more blood.'' Meanwhile, the assembly discussed and voted on
bills annulling legal changes made by the lame-duck,
Sandinista-controlled assembly.
   Changes in the general labor law were annulled by a 48-2 vote,
with the assembly's 40 Sandinista members attending but refusing to
vote.
   Mrs. Chamorra asked Friday that a special commission be formed
to study revisions in the Sandinista legislation. The commission is
to be led by pro-government assemblyman Adan Fletes and include
university presidents, who are pro-Sandinista, meaning the
government has agreed to discuss its proposal.
   About 200 students, many fearing budget cuts that would prevent
them from getting a free education, kept vigil across the street
from the assembly building.
   Most public services were normal Friday after the government and
Sandinista labor leaders agreed Wednesday night to end paralyzing
strikes by public employees.
   The employees got most of what they wanted, including a 100
percent pay raise, proving the Sandinistas still are a force to
reckon with despite their loss in the elections.
   Workers at state sugar mills have threatened to strike unless
they get a 160 percent pay raise.
   Soaring inflation, averaging 70 percent monthly in this country
of 3.5 million residents, is the reason for the big wage demands.

   A charter bus carrying German tourists
rolled over on a mountain highway on Friday, killing one person and
injuring 47 others, authorities said.
   The crash did not involve any other vehicles, said Alice
Huffaker, spokeswoman for the California Highway Patrol in
Sacramento.
   The bus, operated by Southwest Charter Co. of Phoenix, Ariz.,
was traveling state Highway 168 in mountains above the Owens
Valley, which runs down the eastern flank of the Sierra Nevada
range. The 4 p.m. crash occurred about 200 miles north of Los
Angeles.
   It is the same general area where the nation's second-worst bus
killed 21 people in 1986.
   ``Apparently it struck an embankment and rolled once, landing
back on its wheels,'' said Bishop CHP dispatcher Bob Storar. One
person was killed and 43 others were injured, the CHP said.
   The bus was bound for Mammoth Lakes from Las Vegas, said CHP Lt.
Phil Downs.
   Ambulances and helicopters carried the injured to Northern Inyo
Hospital in Bishop, about 250 miles north of Los Angeles.
   The road where the accident happened is a two-lane highway that
comes out of a mountain pass on a downhill grade with some curves,
Storar said.
   Sylvia Sendall, a receptionist at Southwest Charter, said the
company did not have enough information about the crash to comment.
   The nation's second-worst bus accident occurred May 30, 1986, on
U.S. 395, the main route through Owens Valley, about 100 miles
north of the scene of Friday's crash.
   The bus veered off U.S. 395 and into a river, killing 21 and
injuring 22. The National Transportation Safety Board concluded
that the bus's excessive speed through a curve caused the crash.

<HEAD>Feds' Attempt To Derail Record Settlement Rejected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Friday rejected the Bush
administration's attempt to derail a record $5.5 million settlement
of a lawsuit against Unocal Corp. for polluting San Pablo Bay.
   The settlement, awarded in a lawsuit by the Sierra Club, will
pay for a variety of cleanup, restoration and wetlands acquisition
projects around San Francisco Bay.
   The suit was over discharges of chemicals from a refinery in the
community of Rodeo that bypassed the company's treatment plant and
flowed into San Pablo Bay, at the north end of San Francisco Bay.
   The U.S. Justice Department, on behalf of the Environmental
Protection Agency, entered the case for the first time in March and
appeared to ask that $4.2 million of the settlement be paid to the
federal government. That would be the entire amount awarded except
for $1.3 million in legal fees and costs.
   The settlement called for the money to be spent by various
environmental agencies on the clean-up.
   The department argued in letters sent before Friday's hearing
that ``civil penalties'' for violation of the federal Clean Water
Act belonged to the federal government. But the department quickly
backtracked _ first clarifying its position that only a portion of
the money was properly viewed as a penalty, and then dropping its
request for funds altogether.
   At Friday's hearing, Justice Department lawyer Charles Sheehan
made a different argument: that future polluters would not be
adequately deterred unless more of the settlement was shifted from
specific projects to a direct payment to the state treasury. He
asked that a proposed $500,000 payment to the state for unspecified
emergency cleanup work be increased by $1 million from funds
elsewhere in the settlement.
   ``We're not asking that any money be paid to the federal
treasury,'' Sheehan said. ``It's sufficient for federal interests
that it go to a state of California fund.'' But he asserted that
only a payment to a government treasury can be considered a penalty
under the law, the kind of action that ``sends the strongest
message across the country.''
   ``Any discharger would prefer to (have) money spent locally
where they could reap favorable publicity and be seen as
environmental philanthropists,'' Sheehan said. He also contended
Unocal might be allowed to claim a tax deduction on any sums spent
on projects.
   But Unocal lawyer John Barg said the company acknowledged that
the entire sum in the settlement was a non-deductible civil
penalty. The Justice Department's position was also rejected by
everyone else at the hearing, including U.S. District Judge Samuel
Conti, who approved the settlement.
   Conti said Sheehan was ``throwing a lot of monkey wrenches''
that, if effective, could prolong the already 6-year-old case by
another decade. The judge also said the settlement was fair, would
serve to punish Unocal and deter others, and properly earmarked
money for projects ``that will do some good locally.''
   Stephan Volker, lawyer for the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund,
said the settlement was the largest civil penalty ever in a citizen
enforcement suit under the Clean Water Act. He said it would ``send
an unmistakable message to dischargers that there is no profit in
pollution.''
   Volker said the wastes flowing into the Bay included phenols and
other potentially cancer-causing substances such as benzene,
toluene, acetone and TCE.

   The youth who allegedly led a white mob in a
fatal attack on a black teen-ager was acquitted of murder and
manslaughter Friday, a day after a co-defendant was convicted of
second-degree murder.
   The partial acquittal of Keith Mondello sparked a courtroom
outburst from supporters of the family of the 16-year-old victim in
the case which had inflamed racial tensions in the city.
   ``We'll do it ourselves!'' some spectators screamed as Mondello
sat crying at the defense table.
   A jury that deliberated 11 days convicted Mondello, 19, on
lesser charges of riot, unlawful imprisonment, discrmination,
menacing and criminal possession of a weapon.
   On Thursday, a separate jury convicted Joseph Fama, 19, who was
accused of firing the fatal shot, of second-degree murder in the
shooting death of Yusuf Hawkins.
   Confusion reigned in the courtroom as the verdict was read.
Michael Mondello, father of the defendant, repeatedly shouted,
``Thank God! Thank God! Jesus has risen!''
   On the other side of the aisle, relatives and supporters of the
Hawkins family screamed, pointed at the jurors and shouted threats.
   ``He did it, he did it! He set it up!'' several of them screamed
as the verdicts were read by forewoman Mimi Snowden.
   Diane Hawkins, the victim's mother, doubled over, sobbing, and
was hugged by Moses Stewart, the father.
   Two people were ejected from the courtroom for their outbursts.
   In the hours that followed the verdict, police reported a group
of about 150 to 200 demonstrators in the East New York section of
Brooklyn, near where Hawkins had lived.
   A television news crew was pelted with rocks and the windshield
of their van was broken, said police spokeswoman Lisa Guerriero.
The crowd tried to overturn the van, and one reporter was injured,
she said. The extent of the reporter's injuries wasn't immediately
known.
   The most serious charges of which Mondello was convicted, riot
and unlawful imprisonment, carry jail terms of one and one-third to
four years. Prosecutors said they would request the maximum
sentence, concurrent terms totaling 8 to 24 years in prison, at
sentencing June 11.
   Fama faces 25 years to life on his conviction. Others of the
group are scheduled for trial later.
   The killing took place Aug. 23, when Hawkins and three black
friends ventured into the predominantly white neighborhood of
Bensonhurst looking for a used car. They were beaten by a mob of
whites wielding baseball bats, and Hawkins was shot to death.
   The killing fueled accusations of bigotry, and the trial, which
coincided with several other racially divisive incidents heightened
tension to the point Mayor David Dinkins went on television to
appeal for calm. Dinkins, the city's first black mayor, asked New
Yorkers to join in a ``weekend of unity'' in the wake of the
verdicts.
   ``I ask those of you who grieve over the loss of Yusuf not to be
swayed by those who would use this occasion to spread their venom
and cause our city more pain,'' Dinkins said. ``The answer to
racism cannot be further assault on our people.''
   Outside the courthouse, demonstrators who awaited the verdict
for more than a week chanted ``No justice, no peace'' as the
Hawkins family exited.
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, an advisor to the Hawkins family, told the
crowd near the courthouse, ``We are not going to take this verdict
lying down. ... We intend to move this city like it's never been
moved before.''
   The verdict was greeted on Mondello's street in Bensonhurst with
smiles, honking car horns and cries of support from friends who
surged into the streets. People hugged and couples cried tears of
relief.
   ``Today, we are bubbling over,'' said Jim League, 37, standing
outside the Mondello home. ``There is justice for all. I feel like
singing.''
   Before the verdict was read Friday, Hawkins' father said the
earlier verdict against Fama didn't ease his pain.
   ``Don't come to me with this foolish rhetoric from any
politician or anybody else about `we love and forgive everybody,'
because everybody is not loving and forgiving us,'' the father said.
   In his closing argument, Assistant District Attorney Paul Burns
said Mondello organized the white mob that stalked the black
youths, encircled Hawkins and left him dying on the street after he
was shot.
   ``Does one of these guys stick around to help Yusuf Hawkins?''
Burns asked. ``No. They all run. Like a mob they came, like a mob
they left. Group courage masking individual cowardice.''
   The victims were targets solely because of the color of their
skin, Burns said.
   But defense attorney Stephen Murphy maintained Mondello and the
other whites didn't intend to hurt Hawkins. He said the gunman
acted independently. The defense contended the mob formed because
of rumors a group of blacks and Hispanics was coming to the
neighborhood looking for a fight, and the youths mistook Hawkins
and his friends for the outsiders.
   ``Some moron shot this young man for no reason. That was
senseless,'' Murphy said.
   Jurors declined to speak individually with reporters. A brief
statement on behalf of several jurors read by the foreman, Ms.
Snowden, called deliberations ``a long and difficult process,'' but
offered no detail on jurors' reasoning.
   Mondello, who held a bat in his hand and stood a few feet from
Hawkins, realized the mistake and was about to walk away when the
shot was fired, Murphy told the jury.
   Mondello, his hands crossed on the defense table, looked skyward
and began crying as the verdict was read. After the announcement on
the final count, he hugged his lawyer, Stephen Murphy.
   Minutes later he left the courtroom in tears, supported by his
father and his mother, Susan.
   ``I think Mr. Mondello is happy with the verdict,'' said Murphy.
``You just can't have a winner.''

<HEAD>St. Helens, Other Cascade Peaks Could Blow, Scientists Warn</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A fog-cloaked Mount St. Helens slumbered
through the 10th anniversary of its devastating eruption Friday but
scientists warned that it could awaken with a vengeance.
   The southwest Washington volcano killed 57 people and turned
verdant forests into an eerie lunar-style landscape in its May 18,
1980, eruption. And there is a ``high probability'' of another
major blast within the next 50 or 60 years, said geologist Dwight
Crandell.
   That eruption could have six times the force of the 1980 blast,
which had the power of a 24-megaton nuclear warhead or 2,500
Hiroshima bombs, he said. Crandell, now retired, co-wrote a 1978
government report that predicted the 1980 eruption.
   St. Helens is the peak in the Cascade mountains most likely to
erupt soon, but other volcanoes in the range should be watched
closely, said Tom Pierson, a U.S. Geological Survey geologist at
the Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver. The Cascades run
from northern California to southern British Columbia.
   Pierson said Mount Baker and Mount Rainier in Washington State,
Oregon's Mount Hood and California's Mount Shasta show some signs
of activity, such as minor steam eruptions and bulging. He termed
Rainier ``perhaps the most dangerous volcano in the Cascades''
because of its potential for destruction of a huge area of Puget
Sound lowland.
   None of the scientists said how far in the future such eruptions
might be.
   The volcano experts and government officials headlined a ``Ten
Years Later'' conference that attracted 250 scientists from across
the country.
   The 1980 eruption must serve as a warning to prepare for
inevitable volcanic disasters ahead, the scientists said.
   Better monitoring and early warning techniques must be
developed, smarter land use planning adopted and citizens must stop
building in the likely path of mudflows and flooding that eruptions
will generate, the experts said.
   Pierson noted the 21,000 deaths when a Colombian village was
wiped out by a volcano a few years ago and said population centers
are flourishing in the likely paths of flooding and mudflows from
American volcanoes.
   St. Helens is quiet now but scientists don't know how long the
calm will last, Crandell said.
   The mountain is being monitored in an unprecedented degree and
``almost certainly there will be a warning'' before another major
eruption, Crandell said.
   ``We are learning things that can be applied elsewhere,'' such
as the precursor earthquakes and bulging of the volcano flanks, he
said.
   ``Before Mount St. Helens, volcanoes were seen as something from
the dinosaur era, interesting but something that happened somewhere
else,'' said Robert Christiansen, chief of volcano hazards for the
USGS.
   Wildlife biologists, foresters and other experts told the
conference the habitat, wildlife and vegetation around St. Helens
have rebounded in a stunning fashion. Virtually every species
devastated by the eruption has come back, they said.
   A helicopter tour of the area dramatized both the destruction
and the recovery. Though snow, rain and sleet obscured the peak
itself Friday, other signs of the eruption were evident _ barren
hillsides still caked knee-deep with gray-brown ash, giant trees
strewn like matchsticks, new river beds riding atop broad mudflow
plains and newly configured lakes.
   The swath of destruction cut by the flow of volcanic material
and shock waves traveling the speed of sound contrasts with the
lush stands of timber that survived.
   But renewal is obvious too. Herds of elk graze on vegetation on
steep slopes near the mountain and trees replanted in the volcanic
ash are growing sturdily, some of them already 30 feet tall. Rivers
and lakes boast good fish runs. A new highway is being punched
through spectacular terrain. Hiking trails abound.

   A federal appeals court judge has refused to
allow the relatives of slain civil rights activists to enter a
lawsuit that attempts to open records of the defunct Mississippi
Sovereignty Commission.
   The relatives wanted to determine if the state-sponsored spy
agency was involved in the 1964 shooting deaths of Michael
Schwerner, Andrew Goodman and James Chaney and the 1966 slaying of
Vernon Dahmer, all in Mississippi.
   Appeals court Judge Henry A. Politz rejected the
``friend-of-the-court'' request without comment May 10.
   U.S. District Judge William H. Barbour in Mississippi ruled July
27 that the Sovereignty Commission records should be opened. That
decision is on appeal to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
where arguments are to be heard July 12 in New Orleans.
   The families attempting to enter the lawsuit said they were
worried because the initial plaintiffs had said they felt the
records should be edited to protect persons who were duped into
giving information.
   The case was brought by civil rights activists Rev. Edwin King
of Jackson and John Salter Jr. of Grand Forks, N.D.

   A jury began deliberations Thursday on
charges that a reputed Colombian drug lord conspired to ship more
than 1,000 pounds of cocaine to the United States.
   Prosecutors contend Jose Abello-Silva operated an extensive drug
shipment network, but he maintains he is a legitimate businessman
who got up and left a key meeting when talk turned to cocaine
smuggling.
   Abello is one of 15 Colombians extradited since August to face
drug charges in the United States, Justice Department spokesman
Harri Kramer said.
   ``He is the biggest fish landed by the United States in the
Colombian sea of narcotics,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney David
O'Meilia.
   He is charged with conspiracy to import drugs into the United
States and conspiracy to possess drugs with intent to distribute.
He was arrested in October in Bogota and extradited to Tulsa.
   Prosecutors called 23 witnesses during five weeks of testimony.
Many were convicted drug smugglers who identified Abello in the
courtroom and said he supervised drug shipments from Colombian
airstrips through the Bahamas.
   Abello testified he was an honest rancher and auto dealer.
   Three prosecution witnesses were named as co-conspirators in
Abello's indictment. Among them was Boris Olarte, who was being
held in a Tulsa jail when Abello allegedly conspired during a
February 1987 meeting in Aruba to import 500 kilograms, or 1,100
pounds, of cocaine into the United States.
   Money from the shipment allegedly was to be used to get Olarte
out of jail.
   Abello is being tried in Tulsa because of phone calls and money
exchanges between people in Tulsa and Florida allegedly part of the
conspiracy.
   The defendant admitted the meeting took place in Aruba, an
island off the coast of Venezuela, but he said when the
conversation turned to cocaine, he left.
   ``He never agreed to do anything with those folks,'' defense
attorney Patrick Williams said in closing arguments.
   The jury, whose identities were kept secret, began deliberating
about 8:30 a.m. Thursday. U.S. District Judge Thomas Brett said
they asked for copies of the indictment and writing materials.
   If convicted, Abello faces an $8 million fine and would serve no
more than 30 years in prison, prosecutors said.

<HEAD>Security Council May Delay on Issue of Soviet Jews to Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arab nations agreed to delay a Security
Council vote on Soviet Jewish immigration to Israel and on
settlements in the occupied lands until after an Arab summit in
Baghdad this month, U.N. diplomats said Thursday.
   The diplomats, from Arab nations and the West, spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   They said after intense negotiations, general agreement was
reached that a formal meeting would be postponed and await the
results of the summit. Fruitless negotiations on a resolution have
been going on more than 2{ months.
   The summit meeting is due to start in Baghdad on May 28. The
question of immigration and settlement in the disputed territories
will be a major item on the agenda.
   Some Arab nations, like South Yemen and Syria, and the Palestine
Liberation Organization favored early consideration of a resolution
that would condemn Jewish settlements in the occupied territories,
the diplomats said.
   The comprehensive resolution, proposed by the non-aligned
nations, would have been vetoed by the United States, they said. It
would have called the settlements illegal and a threat to peace and
security and would have endorsed Palestinians' asserted right of
return and right to self-determination.
   Some Arab diplomats sought to avert a U.S. veto by proposing an
interim resolution that would focus only on the problem of
settlements in the occupied territories.
   Negotiations reached an impasse and most parties decided to
await the outcome of the Arab summit.
   The occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip were
captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. Palestinians claim
the territory as a future homeland.
   Arabs, the Soviet Union and non-aligned nations say the influx
of Soviet Jews into Israel may lead to expanded Jewish settlement
in the territories and undermine chances of a Middle East peace.

<TEXT>
   Six Jewish families on Thursday quietly moved
into temporary homes in the new settlement of Dugit in the occupied
Gaza Strip, Israel TV reported, despite protests by Israeli
leftists and U.S. objections.
   About 800,000 Palestinians live in the Israeli-occupied Strip,
but the Dugit settlers said they do not find that upsetting.
   ``It is not difficult,'' an unidentified settler said on the
television. ``Here everyone you see is invading. This is the State
of Israel _ that is the first thing. What can we do? This is life.''
   Dugit lies only a couple of miles from the Gazan refugee camps
Jabalya and Shati. The Jewish settlers are planning a fishing
community.
   The Dugit settlement received its building permit from the
caretaker government of right-wing Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of
the Likud bloc.
   Since the March 15 collapse of a Likud coalition with the
center-left Labor Party, the government has also given its approval
to a settlement in the occupied West Bank.
   The United States objects to Israeli plans to keep settling Jews
in the occupied lands. U.S. officials say the settlements are an
obstacle to peace.
   Also Thursday, President Chaim Herzog accused the Greek Orthodox
Church of organizing a ``defamatory anti-Jewish campaign'' in
response to last month's move by Jewish settlers into a
church-owned complex in Jerusalem's Christian quarter.
   Herzog said the campaign ``sadly recalls a reversion to
traditional Christian anti-Judaism,'' a reference to the times when
Christian clerics preached that Jews killed Jesus.
   Herzog's stinging criticism was conveyed in a letter to the New
York-based Greek Orthodox primate of North and South America,
Metropolitan Paisios. The letter was dated Wednesday but was
released Thursday to The Associated Press.
   The 150 Jewish settlers moved into St. John's Hospice near the
Church of the Holy Sepulcher on April 11, but the Supreme Court
evicted most of them in a ruling on a dispute over their rights to
use the building.
   The settlement stirred angry protests by Palestinians and by
Christian churches around the world. Christian leaders in the Holy
Land temporarily closed Christian holy sites to protest the move.
   The Israeli government acknowledged after initial denials that
it provided $1.8 million to help fund the settlement.
   In his letter, Herzog also lashed out at the leaders of other
churches who have protested the Jewish settlement.
   He apparently was referring to an open letter by Cardinal John
J. O'Connor of New York. The Roman Catholic prelate called the
settlers' move a ``signal of a conspiracy to grab lands all over
Israel currently occupied by Christians.''

<HEAD>Auction Sets Record for Beethoven Manuscripts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A London dealer on Thursday bought a Ludwig van
Beethoven manuscript of a celebrated chamber work for nearly
$900,000, breaking a record for the composer's music, Sotheby's
auction house said.
   In addition, an anonymous buyer paid $159,800 for an 1811 letter
by the composer to a woman friend, the highest sum ever for a
Beethoven letter.
   Otto Haas, a London dealer, paid $892,000 for the 16-page first
movement of the Sonata for Violoncello and Piano in A Major.
   Beethoven wrote it in brown crayon and black ink in 1807-08,
saying it was composed ``amid tears and sorrow.'' However, scholars
have been unable to determine what he meant by the remark.
   The previous highest auction price for a Beethoven music
manuscript was $168,000 paid in London in May 1988 for his Ninth
Symphony.
   The 1811 letter was written to Bettina Brentano, a poet and
writer. It contained references to two of the greatest German
literary figures, Friedrich von Schiller and Johann Wolfgang von
Goethe.
   In May 1985, $67,600 was paid in London for a letter by the
composer to Antonie von Brentano, the previous highest price for a
Beethoven letter.
   The manuscript and letter belonged to Dr. Felix Salzer, who
taught music theory at the graduate school of the City University

   Why mess with a winning format? Vernel Bagneris
wisely has stuck with the mix of spirited 1920s New Orleans music
and backstage black vaudeville life that he created in ``One Mo'
Time'' for his new show, ``Further Mo'.''
   ``Further Mo''' opened Thursday night at the off-Broadway
Village Gate Downstairs, once the site for the long-running ``One
Mo' Time.''
   Bagneris, who wrote and directed the new show, appears in it as
the laid-back, likable dancer and singer Papa Du. But he shines the
spotlight on his three women singers and sometime shimmy-shakers.
   Sandra Reaves-Phillips, who has toured in ``The Late Great
Ladies of Blues and Jazz,'' brings a big, rich voice to Big Bertha.
Frozine Thomas, who was in ``One Mo' Time'' here, has a highly
musical sound as Ma Reed. Topsy Chapman, as Papa Du's young wife
Thelma, sounds like Nell Carter without the belting.
   There's a little more plot in ``Further Mo''' than in the
previous show. Edna is sick and Papa Du has hired Big Bertha,
former member of the troupe, as ``special surprise guest star'' _
without informing Ma and Thelma.
   This leads to Bertha and Thelma clawing each other with
down-home catty repartee in the dressing room. There may be a few
too many bickering one-liners. Some are fun; others just sound old.
   The main plot idea is based on New Orleans' Lyric Theater
burning down in 1927. Early on, James ``Red'' Wilcher as a wimpy
theater owner nobody should trust tells Papa Du that the theater's
going to burn that night, for the insurance.
   But the attraction of ``Further Mo''' isn't plot. It's music.
Reaves-Phillips heats up the hall with her fervent ``Trouble in
Mind.'' There are some of those funny double-entendre blues, ``One
Hour Mama'' and ``Had To Give Up Gym.''
   Thomas delivers the feminist anthem ``Wild Women (Don't Have No
Blues).'' Chapman gets to sing ``My Man,'' from the ``Ziegfeld
Follies'' of 1921. The three harmonize beautifully on ``Baby, Won't
You Please Come Home.''
   The front of the stage is the stage of the Lyric Theater. One
can see, behind the singers, a dressing room on one side and on the
other side five fine musicians playing trumpet, clarinet, piano,
Sousaphone and drums.
   Norzar Productions Inc. and Michael Frazier produced. Charles
McClennahan designed the set. Joann Clevenger designed costumes.
Pepsi Bethel did choreography.

   The United States, in a bow to the lessened
threat of war in Europe, is dropping its longstanding but rarely
met demand that NATO allies hike defense budgets by 3 percent a
year above inflation.
   The decision is expected to be ratified next week at a meeting
of NATO defense ministers in Brussels, Pentagon sources said
Thursday.
   ``Europe is being transformed,'' said the senior official, who
spoke of the decision on condition of anonymity. ``Basically, it's
a statement of reality.''
   Few countries met the target in recent years, given the shift
toward improved relations with the Soviet Union adopted by many
Western European democracies, even before the fall of the Berlin
Wall in November 1989.

   A 19-year-old was convicted in the shooting
death of a black teen-ager set upon by a white gang last summer, a
murder that brought simmering racial tensions to a boil in the
nation's biggest city.
   Joseph Fama was convicted Thursday of second-degree murder by
depraved indifference for the Aug. 23 death of 16-year-old Yusuf
Hawkins. A mob of 30 bat-wielding youths attacked Hawkins when he
entered the mostly white Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn with
three friends to buy a used car.
   The Bensonhurst case has been watched closely by the city. It
may have contributed indirectly to the election of New York's first
black mayor, and many feared an acquittal in the case could have
led to violent outbreaks.
   Fama shook his head slightly, then stared at the floor as the
jury convicted him of the murder charge and 12 lesser charges.

   A 74-year-old Japanese paper magnate owns the
world's two most expensive paintings after landing Pierre Auguste
Renoir's shimmering ``Au Moulin de la Galette'' for $78.1 million.
   The Renoir was sold Thursday at Sotheby's to Ryoei Saito, who on
Tuesday paid $82.5 million at Christie's for Vincent van Gogh's
melancholy ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet,'' according to Kyodo News

   Saito is the chairman emeritus of Japan's second-largest paper

   ``Works by van Gogh or Renoir rarely go on sale, so I'm very
fortunate. In addition, I think it is wonderful that they will come

   Hopes of easy congressional passage of major
civil rights legislation for the disabled faded on a House vote
that critics say shows the triumph of fear over fact about AIDS.
   By a 199-187 vote, the House approved an amendment Thursday that
lets employers reassign workers with ``contagious diseases'' to
prevent them from handling food.
   The vote came despite last-minute opposition to the amendment by
the Bush administration. Both sides agreed during debate that the
amendment refers mainly to people with AIDS, which spreads through
sexual contact or other exchange of bodily fluids, or by sharing
hypodermic needles.
   Even supporters of the amendment said they were responding to
what they believed were public misconceptions about AIDS, and not
what medical evidence has shown: that casual contact does not
spread the disease.
   ``Perception is reality,'' said Rep. Charles G. Douglas III,
R-N.H. ``We run election campaigns on perceptions. It's reality to
our voters.''

   Charging ``colossal
fraud,'' leftist challenger Juan Bosch has threatened street
protests after falling behind conservative President Joaquin
Balaguer in partial electoral returns.
   With nearly two-thirds of the nation's polling stations
reporting by early today, Balaguer led Bosch by less than 10,000 of
the more than 1 million votes counted, according to the Central
Electoral Board.
   Streets in the capital appeared deserted just after midnight,
with few police seen.
   Bosch, 80, a former president overthrown by a 1963 military
coup, called a news conference to protest the vote count Thursday
after losing a narrow early lead to Balaguer, the blind,
83-year-old incumbent.

   Along with corn, wheat and pork, Iowa is
exporting infants _ to affluent couples from the coasts seeking
``country fresh'' babies from the heartland, adoption officials say.
   ``People in California and New York think of Iowa as a field of
babies waiting to be reaped,'' said Nancy Lee Ziese, adoption
supervisor for Hillcrest Family Services, a private agency in Cedar
Rapids. ``They think no one here does drugs _ we're all the
farmer's daughter.''
   Scores of advertisements seeking a ``healthy, white infant''
appear in the personal columns of Iowa newspapers every week.
Adoption officials in the state say the ads, used to arrange direct
contacts between wealthy couples and natural mothers, deprive less
well-heeled Iowans of adoption opportunities.
   The ads, directed at mothers, promise to ``ease your heartache
... through this difficult time'' and offer a life ``with much
love, warmth,'' and ``laughter and a lifetime of opportunities.''

<DATELINE>VENTSPILS, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If town officials have their way,
Ventspils soon will have the safest, best-run brothel on the Baltic
Sea, and the only legal one in the Soviet Union.
   Sailors from the 3,000 ships that dock in Ventspils each year
would be able to patronize a privately owned, state-regulated hotel
with registered prostitutes who paid taxes and were under medical
supervision.
   Prostitution ``exists and we have to take it under control,''
said Nikolai Bozhko, police chief in this port town of 52,000
people.
   ``We can't be an ostrich who puts his head in the sand,'' he
said. ``That's the situation we were in up until now. We put our
heads in the sand and said `We don't have that here'.''
   Authorities not only know prostitutes operate in the city,
Bozhko said, but where they can be found: at the Cosmos, a dimly
lit place where sailors drink.
   A recent evening visit to the Cosmos, on a central, tree-lined
street, found it to be like many other Soviet restaurants, with a
floor show featuring scantily clad women dancing to American-style
pop music.
   Many patrons were bleached blondes in heavy makeup, miniskirts
and spike heels. No rowdy sailors were visible.
   Bozhko said the current system puts sailors in danger when they
take prostitutes to ``unknown places,'' and the city loses a source
of badly needed foreign currency.
   Ventspils prostitutes charge the equivalent of $30-$50 and sell
the foreign currency to speculators or black-marketeers, Mayor
Aivars Lembergs said. Under the council plan, the city would expect
about 40 percent of prostitutes to register and pay some of their
earnings in taxes.
   ``These women earn as much in a night as I earn in a month,''
Lembergs said. ``They earn as much in a week as the president does
in a month _ no, a lot more.''
   The plan approved in principle by the 90-member council is
designed to legalize prostitution, but not to encourage it.
   Prostitutes who refused to register would be subject to much
more serious penalties than under current law, which Bozhko said
prescribes fines of 100 rubles for a first offense and up to 300
for subsequent ones, with no jail time.
   Since a dollar buys as many as 15 rubles on the black market,
the fines are not much of a deterrent, Lembergs said.
   In Bozhko's vision of a state-regulated brothel, a foreign
sailor would leave his ship and a taxi from the state-approved
private business would take him to a cafe, where he would meet a
state-approved woman who would spend the evening or night with him
in a state-approved hotel.
   Most policemen, doctors and political leaders in Ventspils
appear to favor the plan, Bozhko said, and predicted the Latvian
government also would approve.
   The republic's ``reaction has been: `It's very new, very
interesting','' he said.
   A detailed version of the proposal is being drawn up and
probably will go to the republic's parliament in September, council
secretary Daina Gasanova said.
   If the idea works, it may be tried in Riga, capital of Latvia,
where there was a legal brothel in the 1930s, Bozhko said. He added
that Russian ports also might try it.
   Ventspils has the reputation of being a seedy, polluted port
where chemicals in the air have killed some greenery and children
practice with gas masks in case an ammonia-loading center blows up.
   The town has made strides against pollution in the last two
years, however, and is restoring the buildings and narrow streets
of its medieval quarter for the 700th anniversary.
   Lembergs appeared undisturbed that Ventspils is becoming known
for the brothel plan.
   ``This problem appeared in the world a lot longer than 1,000
years ago,'' he said, smiling, ``and, of course, not in Ventspils.''

<HEAD>Bolivian Indians Seek Return of Ceremonial Weavings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER McFARREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The centuries-old tapestries depicting
gods, animals and people in natural dyes of blue, brown, red and
indigo have become the stuff of legal argument.
   At issue is not their beauty, which is undeniable, but whether
they are private property or the spiritual heritage of an Indian
town.
   Collectors abroad pay handsomely for such weavings made by
Indians of the Andes Mountains from the wool of alpacas, llamas and
vicunas.
   A prolonged legal battle in North American courts pits
international dealers in antiquities against the Aymara Indians of
Coroma, 180 miles south of La Paz by dirt road, and has involved
the Bolivian, U.S. and Canadian governments.
   It is a contest between the concept of private property and the
communal ownership in which Indian cultures find religious
significance, rooted in the lucrative traffic in antiquities and
artifacts from Latin America.
   Elders in Coroma, where about 10,000 Aymaras live in
thick-walled adobe huts on Bolivia's windswept high plains, seek
the return of weavings they describe as sacred.
   In 1988, U.S. customs agents in San Francisco seized 56 textiles
of the pre-Columbian and colonial eras from dealer Steven Berger.
Police in Halifax, Nova Scotia, confiscated about 6,000 Bolivian
artifacts, including an unspecified number of Coroma weavings, from
Roger York, a former partner of Berger.
   All the goods are being held pending court rulings on whether
they were exported from Bolivia illegally.
   Town elders say some people in Coroma sold the cloths, which are
kept in families for generations, to Bolivian middlemen without
community authorization, and the middlemen sold them to the foreign
dealers. The villagers involved have been ostracized, and in some
cases jailed.
   The weavings are used in religious rites, and community leaders
say their loss has disrupted spiritual life. Some blame the absence
of the cloths for troubles in the town and surrounding countryside.
   One of them, Claudio Torres, said: ``The textiles are the
collective property of the community and we never authorized that
they be taken. They are the spirit of the community. Because they
were lost, people have died or lost their eyesight. There is
drought and many animals have died.''
   Torres, who has nine children, makes his living raising llamas
and sheep and growing potatoes and grain. He was interviewed in La
Paz, where he met with Maria Bedoya, director of the Bolivian
Culture Institute, who is helping with the town's case.
   Ms. Bedoya said she was confident the cloths would be returned.
``These weavings are being held captive because somebody took
advantage of the good faith of Bolivians,'' she said.
   Speaking by telephone from San Francisco, Berger denied he had
violated any laws in buying and shipping the weavings.
   ``None of the pieces were stolen and all pieces were purchased
in good faith,'' he said. ``The Indians want to sell their
textiles. I purchased textiles that were for sale.''
   Cristina Bubba, a Bolivian psychologist who supports the town's
efforts, said ``the history of the community is depicted in the
weavings,'' and they are used as oracles to comunicate with
ancestors. ``The ancestors orient or direct the community in
resolving political, social and individual problems.''
   If the directions are followed, ``the community is blessed, the
cattle multiply and there is a good harvest,'' said Ms. Bubba, who
has spent four years studying Aymara culture and religion in
Coroma. ``If the rites are not carried out, negative forces take
hold.''
   About 1.5 million Aymara Indians live in Bolivia and Peru. Their
culture is older than the Incas, who are better known, and always
has put a value on tribal weavings at least equal to that of gold.
   Berger's laywer, Ted Cassman of San Francisco, acknowledged by
telephone that the case involved ``competing interests.''
   ``If an individual has a textile in his family and he decides to
sell it, and some people in the community believe it is not his to
sell, the question is, who is to say to whom it belongs?'' he asked.
   Cassman said it was common in Bolivia for individuals to own,
and even collect, old weavings such as those from Coroma and to
consider them private property.
   The Center for Constitutional Rights, based in New York City, is
among the agencies working with the Indians. Its legal director,
Michael Ratner, said the effort was ``part of a larger movement to
try to get back the patrimony of Indian tribes in the Western
Hemisphere.''

<TEXT>
   Helen Hayes, known more than a half-century as
``first lady of American theater,'' is just playing at being 89
years old.
   She probably could have danced through her walk-on in tonight's
NBC special ``Night of 100 Stars III,'' which features more than
165 stars of stage, screen, sport and fashion.
   ``Did I have anything to do?'' she said, her deep blue eyes
twinkling like sapphires. ``No, I just came on and bowed. That's
all.''
   The audience will see clips from some of Miss Hayes' movie roles
featured in a tribute to great performers and directors.
   ``There was one whole scene in which I broke a bottle and
threatened people with this jagged glass,'' she said, ``and I don't
remember ever doing such a scene. I've been puzzling about it ever
since.''
   She never loved Hollywood, despite her two Academy Awards. Her
first Oscar, for best actress in 1932's ``The Sin of Madelon
Claudet,'' she misplaced for more than a month. The second was for
supporting actress in 1970's ``Airport.''
   ``They didn't know what to do with me out there,'' she said of
her early days in Hollywood. ``I was not the glamorous type that
they were accustomed to promoting and presenting.
   ``There was nothing to do with me but, as Louis B. Mayer said,
when he was cogitating, `Well, I guess the only thing we can do
with you is keep you acting every minute on the screen.' I still
don't know what that means.''
   She cannot bear to watch her old movies. ``It fills me with such
horror and overwhelming frustration,'' she said.
   ``I just wish people would avoid seeing me on the screen because
it makes me very unhappy,'' she said. ``It's like looking at a
snapshot of yourself that is badly posed. You just think, `Oh, I
look terrible in that.' And I feel that way about being on the
screen.''
   Miss Hayes was forced to retire from the stage in 1971 after a
two-week run in ``Long Day's Journey into Night'' that nearly was
canceled when she was hospitalized after developing an acute
allergic reaction to stage dust.
   Her doctor was blunt: ``He said the terrible words, `If you want
to enjoy a few more years of life, you will never step into a
theater again backstage,''' she said. ``It was like a headsman
coming down with the ax.''
   Yet even if Miss Hayes were able and inclined to return to the
stage, she said she would not, and blames the ``new, unwritten but
certainly understood rules of the theater.''
   Because of theatrical costs, today's playwright ``mustn't have
more than four characters, at the most. Three is acceptable. Two is
ideal,'' she said. ``And there's one set. Better if you could just
have black curtains and the lights.
   ``They're limited to such an extent that I don't think plays are
as amusing or as delightful or as moving or as all-consuming as
plays have been in the past,'' she said. ``There's no hope that
they can ever write them anymore because the economics of the
theater don't allow it.
   ``So there's nothing I could hope to do. And thank goodness for
that, because I wouldn't like to be yearning and not be able to
realize my hope and dream.''

   Elsewhere in television ...
   BYE-BYE, BOB: The last ``Newhart'' airs on CBS tonight, followed
by film critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel in their first
prime-time special, a look at the film industry.
   ``The Last Newhart'' is a funny finale for the 8-year-old
sitcom. Bob Newhart, as innkeeper Dick Loudon, is the sole holdout
in Stratford, Vt., when the Japanese buy up land to erect the
``luxurious, 5,000-room Tagadachiville Hotel.'' Flash forward five
years for the townspeoples' reunion, and brace yourself for one of
the niftiest surprise endings in television.
   Siskel and Ebert interview Clint Eastwood, Kathleen Turner,
Danny DeVito, David Lynch and others. The two critics contend the
the motion picture rating system makes it harder to create movies
that don't have a happy ending.
   ``Like all critics, we want films to be smarter than we are, to
confuse us, not to be so obvious. And they are so obvious,'' Siskel
said. ``And that's the problem.''
   Ebert proposes a ``A'' rating to head off the box office kiss of
death for serious, adult movies. ``If we had an A rating,'' he
said, ``then newspapers could advertise them, studios could make
them and exhibitors could show them without all of this mystique
that's grown up around the X rating since it was hijacked by
pornographers.''

<HEAD>Jerry Garcia's ``Reefer Madness''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DIPIETRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's a different kind of reefer madness these
days for Jerry Garcia. The man they used to call Captain Trips has
become Captain Cousteau.
   The unassuming singer and guitar wizard of the Grateful Dead,
whose music sprouted from the ``Acid Test'' LSD parties of the
1960s and remains an enduring legacy of the psychedelic era, now
gets his kicks underwater.
   ``I like the water. I like the way it feels. I like slipping
around in it,'' Garcia said. ``I feel like a fish. It's sort of
like having an infinite aquarium to swim around in.''
   Garcia is on a ``working vacation'' in Hawaii that includes two
concerts with his Jerry Garcia Electric Band and as much scuba
diving as possible. His first show on May 19 at Waikiki Shell was
Garcia's first Hawaii performance since 1970, when the Dead last
played Honolulu.
   The second concert May 20 at Hilo Civic Center was a benefit for
The Ocean Recreation Council of Hawaii. TORCH is trying to preserve
Hawaii's coral reef by placing anchor mooring pins in ocean waters.
The moorings would be used by fishing and tour boats that currently
drop anchor into the coral reef and destroy it.
   ``I've seen what anchors do to coral,'' Garcia said. ``The reef
is the bottom of the food chain. It provides food for the fish and
so on, and the fish end up on people's plates and so on. If you do
away with the coral you're basically thrashing the whole economy of
the islands, or at least a large percentage of it.''
   Garcia also is active in the rain forest movement. The Grateful
Dead has raised more than $1 million for environmental groups such
as Greenpeace and the Rainforest Action Network.
   Garcia, 47, started scuba diving three years ago, shortly after
recovering from a 1987 coma caused by untreated diabetes and
exhaustion. That illness, which almost killed him, occurred a few
months after he stopped using cocaine and heroin.
   In more than one way it was a rebirth for the beloved and
reluctant figurehead of the Dead Heads subculture that spreads
across the globe and numbers in the hundreds of thousands.
   Garcia's recovery was followed by the 1987 release of the most
successful Grateful Dead album ever, ``In the Dark.'' The current
album, ``Built to Last,'' also has gone gold, but never caught on
with radio stations and didn't fare as well commercially as ``In
the Dark.''
   Not that Garcia cares very much.
   ``We certainly aren't Top 40. That's not what we do, it's not
who we are,'' he said. ``Our relationship to Top 40 is pretty
remote. It's almost as remote as our relationship to classical
music or mainstream jazz. We're about 90 degrees off of just about
everything.''
   Garcia said the Dead is working on a live album that will
feature material performed on tour this spring. It should be out by
summer, and the band is planning a series of stadium shows with a
European tour slated for fall, the band's first in a decade.
   Also, the band has begun work on releasing vintage concerts from
its massive tape vault on compact disc. The first of these should
be available by the holidays. The ongoing project should keep the
band busy ``well past the turn of the millennia,'' he says.
   Despite the success, there's trouble in Grateful Dead land. It's
beoming more difficult for the band to find places to play, as more
and more venues say the problems, real or perceived, associated
with the Dead outweigh the big economic boost a series of Dead
concerts provides to a community.
   As the success of the band increases _ 1990 is their 25th
anniversary _ many people come to concerts without tickets to take
part in the ``parking lot scene'' of hanging out and partying.
Sometimes this leads to confrontations with police when ticketless
fans try to crash a concert.
   There also is the problem of drugs. As the band that made its
name at the famous LSD parties thrown by Ken Kesey and his Merry
Pranksters, the Dead and their fans always have been associated
with mind-expanding substances. While the band frowns upon drug use
now, there still are significant numbers of fans who don't.
   The band and most of the Dead Heads are making a very conscious
effort to minimize their presence, cutting down on outside vending,
camping and working to keep concert areas clean and positive.
   ``The audience has been behaving so well lately,'' Garcia said.
``We've been communicating with them what it is we have to deal
with.''

   So, like, last summer Ed Duffy was raking the
kind buck at Grateful Dead shows selling Central American clothing.
Last winter he was pushing his product in a shopping mall, the
victim of a ban on vending at concerts.
   One of rock music's longest-lasting acts imposed the ban last
fall, ending a virtual 25-year party at which fans and vendors set
up tent cities before shows, and entrepreneurial neo-hippies hawked
everything from Thai jewelry to vegetable burritos.
   The Grateful Dead opened its spring tour at the Capital Centre
in Landover, Md. Some vendors who tried to sell their goods were
handled in strict fashion by security guards, Duffy said.
   The ban may have signaled the end of a subculture that had grown
to include its own language, food and dress. ``The party was over,
they admitted that. No more circus,'' Duffy said. ``Now, it's like
going to see the Knicks. ... I was into the scene.''
   One of the clearest examples of the Dead subculture is its
peculiar jargon. Kind is the biggest Grateful Dead buzzword,
meaning good or healthy. The term comes from the song ``Uncle
John's Band,'' in which lead singer Jerry Garcia asks, ``Are you
kind?'' Dude is used quite frequently and like, is well, like, you
know, used almost as punctuation.
   ``A lot of the scene goes beyond music,'' said Eric Rittenhouse,
who supported himself for two years by traveling to Central America
and Asia buying jewelry to sell at shows.
   So, dude, like what it all means is that the kind Dead vendors
who were styling when they were raking at shows are now scamming
another way to keep eating.
   Rittenhouse, 32, took a job in commercial property management
last winter in Los Angeles. Duffy, 28, spent the winter with his
brother, Tim, 25, selling Guatemalan, Peruvian and Ecuadorian
clothing and accessories at shopping malls and flea markets in
Maryland, Pennsylvania and New York.
   Sherri Greif, 28, has managed to keep running her business,
FractalVision, selling psychedelic computer-generated posters,
stickers and videos. The ban, however, has had an impact.
   ``A Dead show is a concentration of people who are really into
the kind of art we do. So it's not really the same,'' Greif said.
   Dead Heads say that in addition to putting an end to vending,
the ban has ended a way of life. Gone are the super-kind veggie
burrito and organic fried rice and the Dead's eccentric entourage.
They've been replaced by fast food and department stores.
   Grateful Dead spokesman Dennis McNally said he appreciated the
fans' commitment to the band, but said the group was not
responsible for providing a living for them.
   ``Over the last two years, the amount of energy that has been
put into the outside scene was more social than musical,'' McNally
said in a telephone interview from San Francisco. ``While we
appreciate the outside activity, it is not a social scene, it is a
music scene.
   ``We stopped allowing vending and camping because facilities and
halls with which we had been doing business with for years said,
`We love you, but we can't do business with you anymore.'''
   Said Duffy: ``It was one of the few ways left in America to grow
up. ``You'd have your adventures. In the old days it was the West.
Now there is no West.''

   Burma, the isolated nation sometimes called the
``hermit of Asia,'' is about to hold its first multiparty election
in decades. Here is a report from Aye Aye Win, Associated Press
correspondent in Rangoon, to which AP correspondents in neighboring
Thailand contributed.

   Burma will hold its first multiparty
elections in 30 years Sunday, but two of the military regime's main
opponents are under house arrest and a third is in prison.
   Diplomats stationed in Rangoon have described the election as a
cynical exercise by heavy-handed military rulers, but some analysts
feel it will create a form of party politics that may evolve slowly
toward democracy.
   The military junta, which brutally suppressed a pro-democracy
uprising in 1988, has allowed scores of parties to form since and
promises the election will be free and fair.
   More than 2,300 candidates _ independents and representatives of
93 parties _ are running for the 485 parliament seats. Election
officials say 18,900 voting stations will be provided and ballots
will be counted in the presence of candidates' representatives.
   Critics point out that however scrupulous the attention to
election rules, most of Burma is under martial law, many opposition
politicians have been arrested and outsiders are not welcome.
   Burma has not approved applications by foreign correspondents to
report on the election and, on May 15, even stopped issuing visas
to tourists.
   ``There is no freedom of speech, there is no freedom of
assembly,'' said one diplomat in the Burmese capital, who like
others here would discuss the situation only if granted anonymity.
``Under those particular restrictions, it is already not a free and
fair election. It is farcical that those the people want to vote
for are not in the election.''
   Aung San Suu Kyi, the most popular opposition leader, was placed
under house arrest in July 1989 for alleged violations of security
laws. The other main leader of her National League for Democracy,
Tin Oo, is serving a three-year prison term.
   Former Prime Minister U Nu, Burma's last democratically elected
leader, was put under house arrest in December. U Nu, now 84, was
ousted in a 1962 coup led by Gen. Ne Win.
   Despite arrests of its leaders and some internal rifts, the
National League for Democracy is clearly the most popular party in
the election. It is one of six to enter candidates for more than
100 of the parliament seats.
   The party's popularity is due in large measure to Ms. Suu Kyi,
daughter of Burmese independence hero Aung San. She emerged as a
brave, charismatic leader during the democracy movement of 1988.
   The League and other parties have held some rallies, but their
focus is on party organization and door-to-door efforts rather than
public display.
   Security is tight in Rangoon, but Western diplomats do not
forsee a replay of the 1988 uprising, when soldiers shot down
several thousand demonstrators in the capital.
   Burma's numerous rebel groups, including students who fled the
repression, are known to have plans to disrupt voting in more
remote areas.
   The National League for Democracy's main opponent is the
National Unity Party, the richest and best organized political
group. It is the successor of the Burma Socialist Program Party,
the military-backed orgnization that controlled the country for 26
years and led it to economic ruin.
   Four other opposition parties are considered to have some
popular backing, but Burmese political analysts say none will win a
parliamentary majority unless the election is manipulated. That
means a coalition.
   The ruling military council, led by Gen. Saw Maung, has said it
will not relinquish power until a government is formed and a new
constitution written, which is expected to take some time.
   ``It's all set up; the government is going to pull all the
strings,'' Josef Silverstein, a leading American scholar on Burma,
said in an interview from the United States.
   ``I think they could tell you today what the vote is going to be
like. They're now trying to figure out how to divide the votes
among the parties.''
   Other foreign analysts stress pre-election maneuvering and
intimidation by the generals rather than possible rigging of the
vote.
   Amnesty International, the human rights group based in London,
accused Burmese authorities of rounding up hundreds of people,
possibly thousands, and said torture was widespread.
   Many diplomats believe one motive for relocating about 500,000
people from cities into the countryside was to have better control
of the election.
   ``There is no rule of law,'' one said. ``The big question is if
the Burmese will really dare vote for the opposition parties.''

   Election day in Burma will be the 312th
day of house arrest for a former housewife and academic who most
analysts believe could lead her party to victory if she were free
do to so.
   Until two years ago, Aung San Suu Kyi was virtually unknown.
Today, she is the country's most popular political figure.
   When the gemerals put her under house arrest July 20, 1989, they
hoped to silence their most vocal critic. It didn't work.
   ``She has now become more or less a martyr figure,'' said a
Burmese expatriate in Bangkok. ``She embodies everything the
Burmese people aspire to.''
   Ms. Suu Kyi, 44, is graceful and articulate. She emerged as the
star of Burma's hazardous political stage less than two years ago,
at the height of a national uprising for democracy that was
brutally crushed.
   Her father, Aung San, is revered in Burma as the leader of the
movement for independence from British rule. He was assassinated in
1947 and Burma achieved formal independence Jan. 4, 1948.
   Other dissidents were cowed into silence by the army's ferocity,
but Ms. Suu Kyi refused to bow to the junta that took control in
September 1988.
   Soldiers killed thousands of dissidents that year and thousands
more have been arrested since. Ms. Suu Kyi said she sometimes was
threatened, but she continued criticizing the junta's human rights
abuses and campaigning for democracy.
   She is the antithesis of Ne Win, the reclusive general who ruled
Burma from 1962 to 1988, and is the only Burmese politician who has
dared attack him openly.
   ``Everyone knows who was responsible for all the bad things in
Burma, but she was the first to blame Ne Win,'' said a Burmese.
``No one had the guts to do that before.''
   Ms. Suu Kyi had lived abroad since she was 15 and happened into
politics by chance when she returned home to nurse her dying mother.
   She studied at Oxford University and married an English academic
in 1972. Later, she began an academic career of her own and worked
for the United Nations.
   The political program of her National League for Democracy is
vague, but Ms. Suu Kyi has referred in many speeches to the
non-violent liberation movements led by Mohandas K. Gandhi of India
and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the United States.
   Before her detention, tens of thousands of people defied martial
law and heavily armed soldiers to hear her speak.
   After being put under house arrest, she began a hunger strike to
demand humane treatment for imprisoned supporters. She took only
liquids for nearly two weeks, until the government gave guarantees.
   ``Martin Luther King said to the people `I have a dream','' she
told a reporter last year. ``Well, it is the same with us. We just
want to bring our dreams to reality.''

   Here are some facts and figures about
Burma:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Burma is about the size of Texas, bounded on land by
India, China, Thailand and Laos. Rangoon, population 3.5 million,
is the capital and largest city. Mandalay, in the heart of the
country, is the second largest city and the center of traditional
culture.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ Most of the 41 million people are Burmese.
Important minorities include Chinese, Indians, Karen, Shan, Chin
and Kachin. About 85 percent of the population practices Buddhism.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Burma is a major rice producer and is endowed with
great natural resources, including teak and minerals, but is among
the world's poorest nations. Its economic failure is generally
attributed to mismanagement and a crippling war against a dozen
ethnic minorities seeking greater autonomy.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Burma's golden age was the 12th century, when its
kings built the spectacular temples of Pagan. Britain ruled the
country from 1886 to 1948.
   After a chaotic post-independence experiment with democracy, a
military coup in 1962 brought Gen. Ne Win to power. He stepped down
in 1988 during a pro-democracy uprising that was brutally crushed
by the army. A military council led by Gen. Saw Maung now is in
charge.
   Burma has been called ``Asia's hermit'' for its isolationist
policy of recent decades. The current military rulers have allowed
far more foreign private investment than Ne Win's government did,
but still seek to restrict outside influences. Foreign journalists
have been virtually banned.

<DATELINE>SHIYAN, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mules pull the loads and there's hardly a
car to be seen in Motor City, China.
   This city of 378,000 in the mountains of central China is home
to the Second Automobile Works, the nation's largest truck
manufacturer, which employs 80,000 people and indirectly provides
livelihoods for many more.
   It made 135,000 trucks last year, about one-fourth of all the
motor vehicles China produced.
   The Second Automobile Works has brought the 20th century, and
prosperity, to a backwater where peasants still use mules and water
buffalo to scratch a living from the rocky terrain.
   When China was in the throes of the Cultural Revolution in the
late 1960s and relations with the Soviet Union were extremely
tense, Mao Tse-tung decided to move key industries out of the way
of upheaval and invasion.
   In 1969, it was decided trucks would be made in Shiyan, a small
town in the poverty belt of northwest Hubei province.
   ``There was nothing here but rice paddies then,'' said Ma Yue,
executive vice president of the plant, who arrived in 1971. ``There
was no place to live, so we had to stay with farmers.''
   Young men brought in as workers had difficulty finding wives, so
a textile mill was built to attract young women.
   Today, per capita annual income is about 2,800 yuan ($595) for
workers at the truck plant and 2,300 yuan ($489) for Shiyan
residents in general. Both are roughly double the national average.
   Trucks from the Second Automobile Works are in great demand _
all 140,000 vehicles to be made this year are sold _ so Shiyan has
escaped an economic slump that began affecting most of China six
months ago. The city's industrial output in the first four months
of 1990 grew by 5.1 percent.
   Unemployment is a problem in China as a whole, but not in
Shiyan. Because the area is so remote, the truck plant relies on
local sources for 70 percent of its parts.
   Company officials also say the state-run enterprise will not lay
off workers as it automates, although the factory appears
overstaffed.
   During a visit to the final assembly plant, 146 people were
working along a 785-foot production line. Children of workers are
usually guaranteed jobs at the plant.
   Shiyan has shown off its affluence by building a musically
synchronized fountain, costing the equivalent of $170,000, that
provides residents with a colorful water symphony every weekend.
   Mayor Wu Fayu said that, by supporting the truck factory and
``marching along the socialist road,'' the people of his city were
``leading a comfortable life.''
   Poverty still reigns outside the city. Beyond the drab,
functional apartments for factory workers, farmers hack at tiny
vegetable patches next to one-room huts of brick and mud.
   Water buffalo pull plows through rocky soil. Women wash clothes
in streams while their children bathe.
   After leaving Shiyan, the road quickly deteriorates into
potholes and stretches of construction, where young boys chip at
the mountainsides with pickaxes.
   Buses, jeeps and trucks cruise on the city's wide, empty
streets, but there are virtually no passenger cars. Carts pulled by
men or mules carry produce and supplies.
   The few traffic lights in the self-designated Motor City of
China were turned off during a visit to Shiyan. Street lights on a
main avenue did not come on after dark and couples strolled down
the middle of the moonlit street.
   Guo Shuyan, the provincial governor, said northwest Hubei was so
remote the the government did not know of a serious food shortage
in one area until a newspaper reporter wrote an expose. He said
authorities quickly sent 44,000 tons of grain.
   Company officials acknowledge being more than 600 miles inland
from Shanghai is a drawback to competing in the expanding Chinese
auto industry.
   ``We are in the mountains, so we have to provide our own schools
and welfare facilities,'' Ma said, and about 10 percent of the 1989
profit of 600 million yuan ($127 million) went to welfare programs.
   Asked about the original decision to build the plant in Shiyan,
Ma replied: ``It was the 1960s, and we had no choice.''
   Shiyan will remain the company's base, but it has ambitious
plans and is looking elsewhere.
   A joint venture with Citreon of France to produce 150,000 small
passenger cars annually by 1993, and up to 300,000 later, will be
built in Wuhan, the Hubei provincial capital. Wuhan is on the
Yangtze River, an ideal route for shipping finished cars.
   Xiangfan, on the plains 120 miles east of Shiyan, will be the
site of a plant to produce up to 400,000 engines a year for the
joint venture.

   In the unfamiliar landscape of a Western
Europe no longer threatened by the military might of the Warsaw
Pact, NATO is searching for a new reason to be.
   Communism's collapse in Eastern Europe last year gave the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization the victory for freedom and democracy
it had sought for four decades. But it also stole the alliance's
main reason for being and has led some analysts to question whether
there is any role left for NATO.
   The Berlin Wall is history. The Iron Curtain is parting.
Missiles are being blown up. People on both sides of the Atlantic
are asking: Who needs NATO?
   President Bush, who meets next week with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, says the alliance, in one form or another,
must remain. Gorbachev says it should be dissolved, as should the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   Washington fears that Western satisfaction with Soviet peace
moves will create an unstoppable momentum toward disarmament that
could erode U.S. influence in Europe and undercut the nation's role
as a superpower.
   NATO, the officials say, is a guarantee of continued U.S.
influence in Europe.
   Secretary of States James A. Baker III said in a speech May 14
that the alliance will remain ``the place where Western democracies
join in guaranteeing the new peace of Europe.'' But he also said
NATO must adapt to the new political order.
   Bush and leaders of the 15 other NATO member countries will meet
July 5-6 in London to try to preserve the alliance by redefining
its role.
   The next day, defense ministers from the seven-nation Warsaw
Pact will gather to consider that alliance's future.
   The first non-communist defense minister of East Germany, Rainer
Eppelmann, has indicated the eastern alliance might be preserved as
a political forum _ for a limited period.
   But he added that ``it now appears as though the Warsaw Pact is
in the process of dissolving itself.''
   In the Soviet view, both alliances ought to be dismantled,
replaced by broad new European security structures to include the
United States and the Soviet Union.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze earlier this
month proposed, as a first step, the immediate creation in Berlin
of a ``pan-European center for the elimination of the military
threat,'' to control military activity in a unified Germany.
   Gorbachev and Shevardnadze say a NATO including Germany would
upset the fundamental East-West balance of power in Europe.
   The Soviets have so far refused to accept a U.S.-West German
formula that would incorporate a reunited Germany in NATO but allow
Soviet troops to remain temporarily in what is now East Germany.
   Unified Germany's role in NATO, if there is one, is the subject
of discussions among the four victorious World War II allies _ the
Soviet Union, the United States, Britain and France _ and the two
Germanys themselves.
   Assuming NATO lives into the '90s, what will it look like?
   No West European leader has explicitly urged the disbanding of
NATO or the dismantling of its multinational military units. Most
seem to agree that substantial changes of some sort will be
necessary, but few have offered concrete ideas.
   France, which left NATO's military structures in 1966 but
remains a member of the alliance, has been most vocal in advocating
the formation of a new security apparatus that would include all
European nations, plus the two superpowers.
   Many analysts agree that NATO will shift its focus, becoming a
more political and less military organization. Yet none has defined
a political role for the alliance beyond its efforts in recent
years to discuss terrorism and other aspects of international
relations.
   Frank J. Gaffney Jr., director of the Center for Security
Policy, a Washington think tank, believes the alliance is at the
point of death and is unlikely to be fully revived.
   ``We're not going to change the sense in many quarters that the
Warsaw Pact no longer exists, that the Cold War threat is gone,''
said Gaffney, a former senior Pentagon official in the Reagan
administration,
   Besides adjusting to the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact and
the unification of Germany, NATO faces a key dilemma of military
strategy: How to publicly manage popular arms reductions while
maintaining a credible deterrent to nuclear war.
   Some say it can't be done, at least not in the present NATO
scheme.
   They suggest, in a variation of Shevardnadze's proposal, a
phasing out of NATO's military role and merging its political
councils with those of less well-established forums that would
include the Soviets and Eastern Europeans.
   This would provide a European-wide security framework and reduce
East-West tension while preserving a role in Europe for the United
States and Canada.
   ``There still does need to be an international organization
regulating military power in central Europe,'' said John D.
Steinbruner, director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington think tank.
   Karsten D. Voigt, a defense expert in the West German parliament
and a member of the opposition Social Democrats, said recently that
the long-term goal should be to supplant NATO and the Warsaw Pact
with a European security treaty signed by the 35 members of the
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.

   From Africa to Latin America to Eastern
Europe, Moscow's domain is crumbling.
   Soviet troops have left Afghanistan. The Marxist regime in
Nicaragua is history. Ethiopia and Mozambique are veering from
their rigid pro-Soviet ideologies.
   Not to mention the disintegration of the Iron Curtain.
   The speed of it all has taken Mikhail S. Gorbachev by surprise
and dramatically altered his stance as he heads into next week's
Washington summit meetings with President Bush.
   Soviet leaders and American presidents have met since Nikolai
Bulganin and Dwight Eisenhower gathered with the leaders of Britain
and France in 1955, 10 years after Josef Stalin won territorial
concessions at Yalta that some said helped tighten the Soviet grip
in Eastern Europe.
   For decades after Bulganin and Eisenhower met in Geneva, Moscow
widened its circle of influence, becoming, to Ronald Reagan in
1983, the ``evil empire.''
   How quickly things change. In less than a year:
   _Poland and Hungary have held free elections, resoundingly
defeating candidates who represented the status quo.
   _Czechoslovakia's Parliament elected dissident playwright Vaclav
Havel as president, replacing Communist Gustav Husak.
   _Bulgaria's head of state, Todor Zhikov, resigned.
   _Nicolae Ceausescu was executed in Romania.
   _East Germany dissolved its communist government and opened the
Berlin Wall. It is headed toward reunification with West Germany.
   Within the Soviet Union, Gorbachev's power is threatened by
ethnic and economic nationalists.
   He has been jeered by crowds in Red Square. He has been
criticized within the Communist Party for being too fast, or too
slow, in remaking the Soviet political and economic systems. He has
dispatched troops to quell ethnic violence.
   He has beseeched Lithuania, unsuccessfully, not to declare
itself independent. He is trying to cajole two other Baltic
republics, Latvia and Estonia, not to follow the Lithuanians.
   Gorbachev has applied increasing economic pressure to Lithuania
to rescind its declaration and President Bush has said the standoff
between Moscow and the Baltic republics ``certainly puts some
tension'' on the summit.
   In all, Gorbachev will go into the summit with less of a power
base than any of his postwar predecessors.
   ``It puts Gorbachev in a weakened position in which he basically
has to, in effect, ask the West for its indulgence as he tries to
ride out the crises,'' said Michael J. Sodaro, a George Washington
University political scientist and an expert on East Germany.
   ``On the other hand,'' Sodaro added, ``it puts the West in a
position in which we don't really want to take excessive advantage
of Gorbachev's internal problems for fear that there might be a
conservative backlash and Gorbachev would be deposed. He recognizes
that the West has an interest in his continuation in power.''
   Observers said they are sure that Gorbachev, in introducing
relative freedom of expression and political action to the Soviet
domain, did not anticipate the results.
   ``He came to power dealing with not only the problems left to
him by a Communist regime that has failed but by Russian history,''
said Arthur A. Hartman, U.S. ambassador to Moscow from 1981 to
1987. ``I can't believe he didn't know he would have to deal with
those problems. On the other hand, I don't think he predicted
exactly the way things have gone.''
   Janusz Bugajski, an Eastern European specialist at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies, said, ``I don't think
there was any preplanning for what happened in Eastern Europe.
There was no blueprint. I think what happened was that Gorbachev
became educated during the late '80's as far as the likelihood of
some major revolution.''
   Sodaro said, ``I think even the most farsighted advisers to
Gorbachev were stunned by the rapidity of the dissolution of
Communism in Eastern Europe and East Germany.''
   The suddenness of those events, he added, is affecting the
attitude of Kremlin leaders toward developments in the Baltic.
   ``I don't think they want as rapid a disintegration of the
remaining part of the empire,'' Sodaro said.
   ``I think Gorbachev from the outset wanted to purge the Soviet
system from the vestiges of Stalinism, and certainly the
acquisition of the Baltic states can be chalked up to Stalin,''
said Sodaro. ``I think in the back of his mind he and his advisers
would have to expect this would happen. But I don't really think
that he intended from the outset to preside over the disintegration
of the Soviet empire.''

   Radicals control the city councils in Moscow and
Leningrad. Protesters call the president a dictator _ to his face.
Forty-five thousand people daily pass through McDonald's golden
arches blocks from the Kremlin.
   ``The nation is quite different from what it was in the early
1980s,'' President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the Soviet Congress
last September.
   Indeed it is.
   While repeatedly reminding Soviets and foreigners alike that he
is a devout Communist, Gorbachev has borrowed generously from
Western democracy and capitalism to try to cure the multitude of
ills afflicting his country.
   He has freed scores of political prisoners, opened the press to
freewheeling reporting on once-taboo subjects, ended the Communist
Party's monopoly on power and moved to make the country subject to
the rule of law, not the whims of a dictator.
   Popularly elected officials, including many with unconventional
views, have been brought into the decision-making process. Ardent
reformers have taken control of the Moscow and Leningrad city
councils. Multiple-candidate elections, a strong presidency and a
working legislature have been cto rigid schemes.''
   Such an approach, however, is not shared by all those with whom
Gorbachev shares power. Nor is the Soviet populace solidly behind
Gorbachev, who has admitted to ``miscalculations and mistakes
during perestroika,'' his program to restructure the Soviet economy.
   Tens of thousands of protesters were allowed to march through
Red Square on May Day. Some jeered Gorbachev and carried posters
comparing him to Nicolae Ceausescu, the Stalinist dictator of
Romania executed in December in the midst of a popular uprising.
   Gorbachev has shown himself to have a thick skin, sitting
through much of the Red Square protest as well as hours of
legislative debate that included harsh criticism of his policies.
He welcomes what the ``democratization'' of Soviet society has
fostered and advises conservatives not to be upset.
   ``Pluralism of opinions is not dissent but democratic centralism
understood in a new way,'' he told the Central Committee.
   On occasion, however, he has complained bitterly that the press
is too negative, headlining society's problems without offering
solutions.
   Informal political groups, some of them seedlings of alternative
parties, have arisen throughout the country. Protesters have driven
local leaders from office in dozens of regions.
   Although allowing such protests can be risky by exposing leaders
directly to the people's wrath, Gorbachev sees the political
reawakening of his nation as a way to get people thinking and
acting creatively to solve the country's problems.
   ``One can only welcome the fact that the broad mass of people
has become involved in the management of the state and society,''
he told the legislature.
   Inheriting an economy plagued by shortages, long lines, waste
and little incentive for workers to produce more or better goods,
Gorbachev has looked West for solutions. Although the word
``capitalism'' isn't creeping into the official vocabulary,
``individual enterprise'' and ``market-oriented economy'' are.
   In March, the legislature passed a law permitting Soviets for
the first time in nearly 70 years to own the ``means of
production,'' an approach at odds with classical Marxist doctrine.
Karl Marx saw in private ownership the roots of capitalist
exploitation; the Russian Revolution 72 years ago supposedly
cleansed society of that evil. The new law, which takes effect July
1, allows citizens to own small factories and hire their own
workers.
   Another law allows peasants to bequeath the state-owned plots
they till to their children.
   The government is also considering commodity and stock exchanges
and comprehensive price reform.
   Perhaps the most visible evidence that a touch of capitalism has
come to this Communist giant is the Moscow McDonald's, a joint
venture fostered by McDonald's of Canada. The restaurant, on
Pushkin Square six blocks from the Kremlin, serves 45,000 customers
daily, Tass reported.
   It is the largest McDonald's in the world. The line snaking
along the sidewalk and around the square is rivaled only by the
number of pilgrims standing patiently on Red Square waiting to be
ushered into Lenin's tomb for a quick glimpse of the founder of the
Soviet state.
   One joke making the rounds in Leningrad implies Gorbachev may be
taking the reforms too far, selling out to the West.
   The Soviets, the joke goes, decide to try to raise hard currency
by auctioning off the Lenin Mausoleum. The Americans are the
highest bidder and decide to move the mausoleum to Lafayette Park,
across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. One day, Lenin
returns from the dead and goes for a stroll. He comes across a
typical American supermarket, its shelves fully stocked. Lenin,
elated but not realizing where he is, proclaims, ``You see what
Leninism has brought, comrades!''

   From the Baltics to Siberia to the southernmost
republics, the Soviet Union is being pulled apart by ethnic strife
and economic self-interest.
   In place of the iron unity of the Soviet Communist Party, there
are now dozens of parties. Hundreds have been killed in ethnic
violence; one in every 500 citizens is a refugee. On a given day
early this year, 130,000 people were on strike. Radical
nationalists seek independence; radical workers demand the Kremlin
leadership resign.
   Such byproducts of glasnost, Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
openness, are sure to be on the agenda when the Soviet leader meets
President Bush in Washington at month's end.
   In the Baltics:
   _Lithuania has declared itself independent in an attempt to show
the way for its Baltic neighbors and other republics seeking to
escape the ``unbreakable union'' formed by Josef Stalin and
extolled in the Soviet National Anthem.
   _Neighboring Latvia and Estonia followed Lithuania's March 11
announcement by declaring an eventual restoration of the brief
independence they had before being forcibly annexed a half century
ago.
   In the South:
   _Georgian Communists seek their own break with Moscow and may
soon follow the Baltics in declaring their independence.
   _Moldavian activists are looking across the Prut River to
Romania, to which Moldavia belonged before being made part of the
Soviet Union along with the Balts.
   _Azerbaijanis recently tore down frontier guard posts in a
demonstration of their desire to unite with their ethnic brothers
across the border in Iran.
   _Scores of Christian Armenians and Moslem Azerbaijanis have been
killed in ethnic violence. Activists say Soviet soldiers sent to
end the deaths themselves killed scores more.
   _Nationalists in the western Ukraine extol guerrillas who fought
Soviet power until the early 1950s and press the rest of the
republic to divorce itself from the union.
   Even in the Russian republic itself, home to more than half the
nation's people and with three-fourths of its land mass, dissidents
are urging a break with the central government.
   There, as elsewhere, the motivation is primarily economic.
   Alexander Vlasov, the Russian republic's premier and a candidate
member of the national Communist Party Politburo, said in an
interview published earlier this month that the republic could no
longer afford to sell its vast raw materials and energy to other
republics at depressed prices while itself paying inflated prices
for goods from elsewhere in the union.
   ``The (Russian) government's obligation is to look out so that
new wholesale and purchase prices answer the strategic interests of
Russia,'' he said, adding that the republic must demand its share
of the hard currency its goods and raw materials earn abroad rather
than seeing that money disappear into the national coffers.
   Other Russians, led by Boris Yeltsin, Gorbachev's most vocal and
popular critic, want more, including a treaty governing relations
with the union, supremacy of Russian laws over Soviet ones and the
right to conduct their own foreign relations.
   ``Every republic should have full sovereignty,'' Yeltsin told
cheering delegates at the first meeting of the democratically
elected Russian legislature this month.
   In Siberia, part of the Russian federation but home to its own
rebellion, thousands of coal miners have struck for better pay and
living conditions.
   So far, the central government has been unable to fulfill the
promises it made last summer to end the walkout. In April, a new
Labor Confederation organized in the Siberian city of Novokuznetsk
called on the national government to resign.
   Said the federation's declaration:
   ``The five-year experience of transition to new economic
conditions ... has manifested the failure of partial reforms in the
economic system where there are no private initiative, enterprise,
competition, market and profit.''
   Gorbachev has implored the dissidents, whether motivated by
nationalism or economics, to think of the union first.
   He has offered two republics, Latvia and Estonia, ``special
status'' in a revamped Soviet federation.
   But in Lithuania, which has refused to rescind its declaration
of immediate independence, he has tightened the screws, cutting off
shipments of oil, natural gas and other materials needed for
everyday life and the republic's industries.
   His foreign minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, says the
dissidents have ``deliberately set a match to a powder keg.
   ``None of them stops to think of the consequences of a social
explosion capable of setting aflame not only addled minds, but also
the enormous stockpiles of nuclear and chemical weapons, atomic
power plants, the zones already stricken by ecological and natural
disasters and regions involved in ethnic strife.''
   Shevardnadze, like Gorbachev, has also found some good in the
growing public discontent with the central government.
   ``The most terrible thing is indifference, when no one
criticizes anyone, and nothing makes any difference to anyone,'' he
told Communist Party comrades recently. ``We have crossed this line
and overcome indifference. There are no indifferent people in the
country any longer.''
   Others have sharper opinions.
   For Latvian People's Front activist Peteris Lakis, a
sociologist, the breakup of the Soviet Union is a ``necessity of
history.''
   Yuri Afanasiev, who is leading a re-examination of Soviet
history, charges that Lenin laid the foundation not of a workers'
paradise but of ``mass violence and state terror.''
   In all, a far cry from the land envisioned in the country's
anthem:
   ``Unbreakable Union of free-born Republics
   Great Russia has welded for ever to stand.
   Thy might was created by will of our peoples,
   Now flourish in unity, great Soviet Land!''

<HEAD>Americans Are Foreign Investors Too</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While foreign investment in this country gets
most of the headlines these days, American investors still are
making waves of their own in the international marketplace for
money.
   Consider that Americans bought and sold a record $220 billion in
foreign stocks during 1989, representing a 45.7 percent increase
over the year before, according to data from the Treasury
Department.
   The previous high of $190 billion was posted in 1987.
   Within the 1989 total, U.S. investors' purchases exceeded sales
by $13.7 billion, notes David Strongin, director of international
finance at the Securities Industry Association, a Wall Street trade
group.
   By far the biggest share of the net purchases _ more than $10.5
billion _ was channeled to Europe, attracted by olitical upheaval
in numerous nations and the approach of an economic alliance
scheduled to take effect in 1992.
   ``As a result of the opening of the East, investment interest in
Europe has risen dramatically on an international level,'' said
Heiko Thieme, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Capital Corp. in New
York. ``This trend is also clearly visible among U.S. investors.''
   In part, observers say, cross-border flows of money have been
swollen simply by the international investment movement that has
been spurred by improved financial research and communications
around the world.
   The trend has been abetted by the creation of new vehicles to
meet the demand.
   Not so many years ago, for example, mutual funds set up to
invest in overseas markets were little more than a curiosity in the
world of professional money management. Now they are one of the
biggest growth properties in the business.
   In the first quarter of 1990, points out Reg Green, publisher of
the Bodega Bay, Calif.-based Mutual Fund News Service, sales of
international-fund shares to investors reached $2.5 billion, up
from $400 million in the comparable period of 1989.
   ``The volcanic changes in Europe have lit a fire under the
international mutual funds,'' Green says.
   To some, all this bears many of the markings of a financial fad,
with the accompanying danger of a letdown once the visions it
evokes start to collide with reality.
   In any case, however, analysts say it provides a good gauge of
how international investors see the world outlook in the early
stages of a new decade.
   ``In the 1990s global growth will be led by Europe, the Pacific
Basin nations and perhaps parts of Latin America,'' say analysts at
PaineWebber Inc. in a recent report on the subject.
   ``The U.S. economy, slowed by a lingering budget deficit,
demographically ordained weak consumer spending and heavy debt
loads, will grow relatively slowly. The 1990s look very different
from the 1980s.''
   Such expectations go a long way toward explaining the choices
American investors have been making.
   Nevertheless, PaineWebber has been making an alternative
suggestion for investors wanting to get in on the overseas game
without venturing far from home.
   The firm suggests shopping among the stocks of the best
``foreign companies'' among U.S. corporations _ ``firms that have
powerful positions in foreign markets, whether by virtue of exports
or sales by foreign subsidiaries.''
   One need not look far to find candidates in this category. A
list compiled by PaineWebber of leading companies with large and
growing foreign revenues includes such blue-chip names as Philip
Morris, Merck, Coca-Cola, International Business Machines, Boeing
and Sara Lee.
   ``In the 1990s,'' PaineWebber concludes, ``investors will
increasingly have to consider not just what an American company
sells, but where it sells it.''

   The chairman of the Democratic Party was
having lunch with three former chairmen. Inevitably, the
conversation turned to 1992 and who was making moves toward
challenging George Bush.
   ``We couldn't come up with a candidate,'' said John White, one
of the former chairmen at the table.
   Where are you, Bill Bradley? Why aren't you out there, Mario
Cuomo, Al Gore, Dick Gephardt? What about it, Bob Kerrey, Bill
Clinton, Sam Nunn, Pat Schroeder?
   ``It's kind of spooky,'' said Bruce Babbitt, the former Arizona
governor who was an early causalty in the race for the 1988
Democratic presidential nomination.
   In May 1986, New Hampshire was buzzing with overt and covert
presidential campaign activity. Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and
Babbitt were campaigning actively. Others, including then-Vice
President George Bush, had campaign people working in the state.
   In the past six months, no potential candidates have visited the
state that holds the first presidential primary and no campaign
people are soliciting support for candidates.
   Ditto for Iowa, where the first presidential caucuses
traditionally attract some of the earliest maneuvering.
   ``Normally at this stage of the game you would have least one or
two out making all the body language, doing the fund-raising,
denying they were a candidate. But, obviously, you know, you can
smell 'em,'' said White. ``I don't find that anywhere now.''
   Party chairman Ronald H. Brown, who hosted the luncheon that
also included former chairmen Robert Strauss and Charles T. Manatt,
said he doesn't share White's concern.
   ``I really think a 1991 start is plenty of time. ... I don't see
any real reason or particular benefit to potential candidates being
out this year,'' he said.
   Brown acknowledged that it is ``important to move around the
country to get to know what is on voters' minds and to develop the
techniques for communicating effectively with voters.'' But he
insisted that even those Democrats ``being mildly mentioned'' are
finding opportunities to get around the country.
   ``By this time in the cycle, I'd been out there (campaigning)
for two years,'' said Walter F. Mondale, who learned how tough it
was to challenge a popular incumbent president.
   The quietude is widely perceived as a general reluctance to jump
into a race against the Republican president whose approval ratings
in opinion polls are at near-record levels.
   There are a few stirrings.
   Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder plans to visit both Iowa and New
Hampshire next month and get acquainted with people in the states
that traditionally kick off the presidential nominating season.
   A group of Texans is getting organized to promote Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen for president, but the man who drew rave reviews as the
1988 Democratic vice presidential nominee insists he's not running.
   On any given day Jesse Jackson is delvering a speech somewhere.
Whether that's campaigning or just a way of life is anyone's guess.
   Beyond those three, there are lots of other names, but very
little activity.
   Babbitt is practicing law in Phoenix and writing about the
destruction of the rain forests in Brazil, and showing no
inclination to repeat his 1988 adventure. But like other Democrats,
he worries about the lack of activity in his party.
   ``It's not a good idea to be sitting in the bleachers,'' he
said. ``It looks like a tough game, but you never know what's going
to happen. If everybody hangs back until the last minute it's going
to make it all that much harder.''
   Even if Bush's popularity holds and he proves unbeatable in
1992, there's always 1996 and the prospect of running against Dan
Quayle. His approval ratings run about 40 points below those for
Bush.
   ``I guess I'm more puzzled than troubled about why there seems
to be so little activity,'' said Paul G. Kirk Jr., who was
Democratic Party chairman during the 1988 campaign.
   ``There are those who believe you have to run through this once
before you can fully appreciate it and find the kind of stride and
stamina and message that puts you in shape for another campaign,''
said Kirk.
   Mondale, for one, thinks it's essential for potential Democratic
candidates to get out and discover what it's like running for
president.
   ``It's a different kind of politics ... it's a different set of
issues,'' said the last Democrat to serve as vice president. He
said a candidate needs the intensive travel to ``pick up your
public message'' and identify ``the central themes in American
life.''
   ``I'm not sure anybody knows how strong Bush is going to be in
'92,'' Mondale said. ``He may be strong, but I don't think that's
for sure.''
   Mondale took on Ronald Reagan in 1984 and got little thanks and
fewer electoral votes for his trouble. Three years out of his life,
endless hours on airplanes, thousands of bad meals, nights spent
tossing and turning in drab hotel rooms. And for what?
   He carried his home state of Minnesota and the District of
Columbia, a total of 13 electoral votes, the lowest for any
presidential candidate since Alf Landon was blown away by Franklin
D. Roosevelt in 1936. Mondale was the consensus winner when he
debated Reagan on domestic issues, but his party remembers only
that he was a loser of historic proportions.
   No one seems eager to join him in the record book.
   ``No plans,'' said Bentsen when asked if he might run. But the
attention is nice. ``It's amazing what some of them (presidential
boosters) come in and say. I have people at airports walk up and
say nice things, which I always enjoy.''

<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Take a close look at the 1990 Nissan Pathfinder SE V6 4-Door
4X4. Is there a car lurking underneath that truck exterior?
   You'd swear there is once you've driven this well-designed sport
utility vehicle. It's no wonder the Pathfinder beat out six
competitors in Car and Driver magazine's comparison of sport
utilities.
   The vehicle offered for a test drive came with Nissan's $2,000
sport option package and was surprisingly car-like in its handling
and ride. Watch the tight turns, however, since sport utility
trucks have a higher center of gravity and thus more body sway.
   The Pathfinder is especially versatile considering all the
demands it is built to meet. It's smooth on pavement, handles rocks
with a minimum of bucking and rocking, and takes grassy fields and
occasional potholes with commendable ease.
   Much of the credit goes to the five-link, coil-spring rear
suspension, a system pioneered by Nissan when it introduced
Pathfinder as a 2-door model for 1987. It's designed to help each
wheel work independently and suck up the bumps.
   Toyota has come up with a four-link suspension but many other
sport utilities still have leaf springs, the type more common to
pickup trucks.
   Several of my passengers also were pleased by the relative quiet
inside. The V-6 engine teamed with a five-speed manual transmission
was not bad for a sport utility even when we rode with the stereo
turned off.
   The engine delivers 153 horsepower, sufficient to power the
Pathfinder through the muck and snow admirably. But don't look for
sports-car acceleration. In Car and Driver's comparison test, the
Pathfinder did 0-60 mph in 12 seconds and ranked behind the Jeep
Cherokee Laredo and Ford Explorer in acceleration. EPA fuel economy
with the automatic transmission is 15 mpg city, 18 highway, about
average for 4-door sport utilities. With the five-speed
transmission, it's 15 mpg city, 19 highway.
   Getting into a Pathfinder gracefully without running boards
takes practice, though the test vehicle did have optional step
rails, in the form of rounded black bars running along the bottom
of the doors outside. Women will find them OK with flat shoes,
tricky with heels.
   Getting in and out can also be messy after driving through mud,
because it tends to collect on the step rails, around the wheel
wells and at the bottom of the doors outside.
   The Pathfinder's front seats were spacious and comfortable,
though I had to lean forward to tune the radio because the scan
button was small and needed a precise touch.
   The rear bench seat is comfortable, roomy enough for three
adults and can be folded down _ completely or one side at a time _
for extra cargo space. To do that, you have to remove the rear-seat
headrests so the seat back will fit flat behind the front seats.
And be sure to pull the seat-belt connectors back up after you
unfold the rear seat. Otherwise, they tend to fall below and can't
be reached.
   The 31.4-cubic-foot, carpeted cargo area is reached by a single
rear door, which opens left to right.
   Nissan hopes to sell about 30,000 Pathfinders this year and
expects 85 percent of those to be the new 4-doors. The company only
sold 17,253 last year, after raising prices $1,500 to compensate
for a new U.S. tariff.
   In 1988, Nissan sold 30,344 units, and 34,600 the year before
that.
   The company is pitching the truck at drivers 28 years and older
with above-average incomes. Buyers will need the money: The 4-door
Pathfinder test vehicle had a base price of $20,149 and topped out
at more than $22,000. The two-wheel-drive version starts at $15,720.
   Main competitors include the Toyota 4Runner 4-Door, which starts
at more than $16,200 for a model with a V-6 engine and manual
transmission, and the Isuzu Trooper 4-door, LS model with a
2.8-liter, V-6 engine that starts at more than $16,800.
   Consumer Reports ranks 1987-88 Pathfinders as much better than
average in owner reports of trouble.

<HEAD>Congress Tries Again on Old Problem of Farm Subsidies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No doubt about it, farmers have an image
problem with Congress over the amount of taxpayer money used to
subsidize the nation's production of food and fiber.
   It's an old story, and this year's version is little different.
There are those who claim farmers have been on the public dole for
decades and should be weaned off it.
   Others, with matching fervor, say food production is so vital to
the American dream that agriculture deserves the moral, spiritual
and financial support of all citizens.
   Net spending on farm commodity programs, including direct
payments to farmers, peaked at $25.8 billion in the 1986 fiscal
year and has dropped sharply because of dwindling surpluses and
higher market prices.
   Without choosing sides, the General Accounting Office has taken
one of its periodic looks at the situation in a new report:
``Farming and Farm Programs _ Impact on the Rural Economy and on
Farmers.''
   The GAO, the chief investigative arm of Congress, really doesn't
plow new fields in its 43-page report. But it does provide timely
figures for use by lawmakers during the current 1990 farm bill
debate.
   Congress hopes to agree on a new five-year blueprint in the next
few months to succeed the current Food Security Act of 1985.
   Although the law covers a wide range of measures such as
conservation, rural housing, credit, research, international trade,
food stamps, school lunches and other Agriculture Department
functions, a bundle of commodity programs is its core.
   Those cover price support operations for major commodities such
as wheat, corn and other feed grains, soybeans, cotton, rice, dairy
products, wool and mohair.
   Since the early 1930s, the general thrust of government programs
has been varying degrees of supply management to help prevent the
buildup of huge crop surpluses and low prices.
   In return for complying in the major crop programs _ those for
dairy and some other commodities are structured differently _
farmers get federal price support guarantees, or loans that can be
repaid if market prices improve.
   If market prices don't improve, farmers can forfeit their
commodities to the government and the debt is canceled. Taxpayers
then own the forfeited crops.
   Additionally, in recent times, there are direct income subsidies
called ``deficiency'' payments to make up the difference between
low market prices and ``target'' prices specified by law.
   The differences among the programs for specific commodities are
often complicated, tedious and difficult to comprehend _ just the
right conditions for lobbyists and politicians.
   Another central theme for more than half a century holds that
benefits accrue to those individual farmers who produce the most
bushels, bales or pounds of whatever item is covered by a USDA
program.
   The worker who puts in 40 hours a week on an assembly line is
going to get a fatter paycheck than the part-time employee working
20 or 30 hours.
   And the bigger the farm, the bigger the production. That makes
for bigger subsidies. At least, that's the way it has been most of
the time, although in recent years Congress has tried to limit the
amounts individual producers can collect.
   Some in Congress contend subsidies should be targeted to
smaller, family-type farms to help them survive.
   John W. Harman, the GAO's director for food and agriculture
issues, said analysts looked at farm-sector employment,
distribution of payments among various sizes of farming operations
and some other factors relating to the ``before and after'' passage
of the 1985 farm law.
   ``In summary, the number of farming-dependent counties is
decreasing, and non-agricultural employment in rural counties is
increasingly important to those county economies,'' Harman told
Congress. ``Nine out of 10 rural workers are employed by non-farm
industries.''
   More than half of the nation's farm families have one or more
members working at non-farm jobs, he said.
   ``For the most part, the distribution of farm program payments
did not change substantially after passage of the 1985 farm bill,''
Harman said. ``During the 1985 through 1988 time period, cash grain
farmers received over half of all farm payments.''
   The GAO report showed that in 1988, a total of 632,690 farms
participated in federal commodity programs, which was less than 30
percent of the 2.2 million farms in the United States that year.
   These farms averaged $14,257 each in farm payments in 1988, the
GAO report said. But payments varied greatly by specialty, which
was based on the kind of production that represented at least
one-half a farm's annual sales.
   According to the GAO report, 273,955 cash grain farmers
collected an average of $18,700 in 1988, representing about 57
percent of the total payments.
   Cotton farms, shown at 18,095 units, averaged $32,785 each in
1988. And 199,804 producers of beef cattle, hogs and sheep, got
$10,032 each, the report said. Dairy farms totaled 69,596 and
averaged $10,423 each.
   The remainder of 1988 payments was accounted for by other crops
and livestock operations.
   Looking at farm sizes as measured by annual dollar sales, the
GAO report said that regardless of the type of operation, those
with 1988 sales of $500,000 or more _ some 21,701 farms _ had
average farm program payments of $56,571.
   Put another way, those largest farms accounted for only 3.4
percent of the U.S. total number of units, but got 13.6 percent of
the 1988 government payments.
   Other sales categories:
   _$250,000 to $499,999 sales, 52,260 farms averaged $35,599.
   _$100,000 to $249,999 sales, 154,060 farms averaged $21,364.
   _$40,000 to $99,999 sales, 159,691 farms averaged $10,917.
   _$10,000 to $39,999 sales, 156,591 farms averaged $4,930.
   _$9,999 or less, 88,324 farms averaged $1,410.

   The credibility of admitted felon Ivan Boesky is
on trial along with his former associate John A. Mulheren Jr.,
Mulheren's lawyer said.
   The attorney defending Mulheren against charges of manipulating
markets and breaking securities laws tried to shift the focus of
the trial to Boesky in his opening arguments Thursday.
   ``Ivan Boesky is John Mulheren's chief accuser, and he is
someone who's cheated and lied to both friend and foe alike. He's
one person who throughout his entire life has manipulated people,''
attorney Thomas P. Puccio said.
   ``He will attempt before your eyes to manipulate you,'' he said.
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney E. Scott Gilbert said ``the
government welcomes that scrutiny.''
   ``We submit that you will see that the testimony of these
witnesses, no matter how many crimes they have committed, is
confirmed by other evidence,'' he said.
   Boesky, Wall Street's most notorious felon, is expected to
testify as early as Monday as the government tries to prove
Mulheren schemed with him to break the law.
   It would be the first time Boesky has taken the stand since his
1986 plea agreement, under which he agreed to supply information
about other Wall Street figures in exchange for leniency.
   Boesky paid $100 million in penalties and pleaded guilty to one
count of lying to federal securities regulators to settle the
largest insider trading case in history. He was released last month
after serving two years of a three-year prison sentence.
   Mulheren, 40, is charged with 41 counts of conspiracy,
securities fraud, mail fraud and violating federal record-keeping
laws. He faces a maximum five years in prison and $250,000 fine on
each count.
   The prosecutor told the jury Mulheren manipulated the price of
one stock and concealed ownership of others to help Boesky cheat on
his taxes and evade federal securities laws.
   ``This case is about a two-way street of mutual advantage that
ran between these men,'' Gilbert told a crowded courtroom.
   He said in October 1985, Mulheren bought 75,000 shares of Gulf &amp;
Western stock at Boesky's behest, helping to raise the share price
25 cents to $45 a share.
   That was the level at which Boesky wanted to sell his 3.5
million shares to the company after a failed takeover attempt, the
prosecutor said. The sales _ executed in seven minutes _ helped
Boesky make $800,000, Gilbert said.
   The government also charged Mulheren had concealed the true
ownership of stocks for Boesky to help him avoid taxes during a
business reorganization.
   In alleged sham sales, Mulheren bought the stock but Boesky
retained control over the shares and was responsible for profits or
losses.
   Some transactions were designed to help Boesky's firm, Seemala
Corp., avoid securities laws governing the amount of capital a
brokerage firm must maintain, Gilbert said.
   Puccio told the jury not to confuse Boesky's intentions with
Mulheren's. He said his client never thought he was breaking the
law.
   ``To the extent that John Mulheren ever did anyone a favor or
accommodated anyone in any way, it was legal and he believed it to
be legal,'' Puccio said. ``There wasn't an agreement, there wasn't
a conspiracy, there wasn't a meeting of the minds.''
   He said later a major part of his case will be Boesky's
credibility.
   ``The stench that will be created by Ivan Boesky in this
courtroom will not be removed until this trial is over,'' Puccio
said. ``And all the ammonia the government applies will not be able
to remove it.''
   Mulheren, of Rumson, N.J., a diagnosed manic depressive, was
arrested in February 1988 carrying an assault rifle and Army
fatigues. Police said he planned to kill Boesky. State weapons
possession charges later were dropped and Mulheren placed on
pretrial probation.
   Leonard DeStefano, 34, a former trader at Mulheren's firm, Jamie
Securities, is a co-defendant. He is charged with two counts of
conspiracy and record-keeping violations.
   Gilbert said DeStefano kept a running tally of the alleged
illegal payments to Boesky in violation of record-keeping laws.
   The jury trial is expected to last about six weeks.
   Testimony was expected to continue Monday with the government's
opening witness, Michael Passarella, a partner with the accounting
firm Price Waterhouse. On Thursday, he detailed the federal rules
governing net capital requirements for brokerage firms.

<HEAD>No Distributions Mean No Money For T. Boone Pickens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   T. Boone Pickens, one of the highest paid
executives of the 1980s, will start the new decade with no paycheck
because of low natural gas prices.
   In a meeting Thursday with stockholders of his Mesa Limited
Partnership, Pickens noted that his salary is tied to cash
distributions, which the company has suspended because natural gas
prices are so low.
   Pickens said distributions would resume when gas prices improve.
   ``The turnaround won't come today, and it won't come tomorrow,
but it will come,'' he said in remarks prepared for delivery at the
meeting.
   In response to questions, Pickens estimated distributions could
be resumed by 1992 or 1993, when Mesa is predicting natural gas
prices will reach about $3 per thousand cubic feet. Mesa expects
prices to average $1.65 this year.
   ``These measures have been tough on Mesa unitholders, as well as
Mesa executives,'' Pickens said, adding that 90 percent of his net
worth is tied up in Mesa.
   ``My compensation is based on 1 percent of distributions, so
with no distributions, I receive no salary in 1990.''
   Last year, Pickens was paid $1.8 million based on distributions
of $180 million, Mesa spokesman Jay Rosser said.
   According to Business Week magazine, Pickens was the sixth
highest paid executive of the 1980s, pulling down $56.9 million
from 1980-89.
   ``1990 will be another tough year,'' Pickens predicted, saying,
``Mesa will focus its attention on debt reduction.''
   Pickens admitted he may have paid too much in 1988 when he
bought gas reserves from Tenneco Inc., a move responsible for much
of Mesa's long-term debt.
   ``Considering today's gas price, we may have been a little too
aggressive,'' he said.
   He also conceded past distributions to unitholders may have been
excessive in light of falling natural gas prices, ``but if
distributing money to shareholders is a mistake, it's a burden I
can shoulder,'' he said.
   Distributions had been maintained through profits from other
Mesa investments.
   ``The Tenneco purchase and the doubling of our reserve base to
2.6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalents ... from 1985 to
1989 will pay off in the coming 18 to 24 months,'' Pickens said.
``Our day will come.''
   ``If I wasn't confident about the growth potential of the
natural gas industry, I would have sold out long ago,'' he said.
   Rosser said an overwhelming number of the 300 shareholders at
the meeting said they supported Mesa's decision to remain a limited
partnership instead of converting to a corporation. Limited
partnerships have lost favor somewhat in recent years with changing
tax laws.
   Rosser said many of the shareholders also voiced support of
Pickens in his battle with Koito Manufacturing Co. Ltd. of Japan.
   Through his merchant banking firm Boone Co., Pickens has bought
up more than 26 percent of the auto parts manufacturer. He has been
rebuffed in his efforts to review the company's books, gain
representation on the board and demand a higher dividend, though.
   Pickens said the battle is an example of how Japan is closed to
U.S. investors, charging Koito and Toyota Motor Co. _ Koito's other
major shareholder _ with unfair trade practices.

<HEAD>Big Write-Downs Mean First Loss Since '73, But Analysts See Bright

   Meredith Corp. was talking big losses,
but analysts said the conglomerate's decision to sell several
businesses and focus on its core media interests would provide
opportunities for future earnings growth.
   Meredith, best known for its Better Homes and Gardens and
Ladies' Home Journal magazines, disclosed it would write down
earnings by $64 million in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year to
cover expected losses on asset sales.
   The one-time charge would result in the company's first
full-year loss since 1973.
   Meredith also said Wednesday evening that completion of a
previously announced $487.5 million sale of a printing business
will be delayed until the fiscal year that begins July 1. Proceeds
from that sale could have offset the losses.
   Meredith fell 75 cents Thursday to close at $27.50 a share on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   Analysts said Meredith was acknowledging its poor track record
in investing profits from its magazines and seven television
stations in other ventures and signaling a return to its core
businesses.
   ``The company has had its wrists slapped by the market for going
into investments outside its basic expertise,'' said Claude
Carmichael, who follows Meredith for the New York securities firm
of W.R. Lazard Laidlaw &amp; Mead.
   ``It's a negative that they lost the money. It's positive in
that they're getting back to what they do well,'' he said.
   W. Whitney George of Dominick &amp; Dominick in New York called the
disclosures ``a major step toward being a highly profitable company
in what we recognize as two wonderful businesses. It's unfortunate
it took them so long.''
   Meredith said it would take the write-off to cover expected
losses on the sale of its interests in real estate brokerages in
San Francisco and Saddle River, N.J., and a money-losing television
advertising sales subsidiary in New York. It also said it was
taking a loss on syndicated television programs it purchased that
did not perform up to expectations.
   After taxes, Meredith said the write-downs would reduce fourth
quarter earnings by about $50 million, or $2.68 a share, and that
``the company will expect to report a net loss for the fiscal
year.''
   Spokesman Steve Salato would not speculate on the size of the
loss but said it would be the first for a full fiscal year since
1973.
   Meredith earned $23.5 million, or $1.27 a share, in the first
nine months of the fiscal year. Earnings in fiscal 1989 were $33.2
million, or $1.75 a share.
   President Jack Rehm said the company felt it could not wait
until the July earnings report to disclose the losses. He insisted
the write-off did not endanger Meredith's overall vitality.
   Carmichael said the sale of the printing business has been
delayed by a Federal Trade Commission antitrust review.
   Meredith hoped to conclude the sale of Meredith-Burda before the
quarter ended and could have used its share of the proceeds to
offset the write-downs. It said it still believes the deal will be
completed.
   Meredith-Burda is equally owned by Meredith and the Burda family
of West Germany. The buyer is R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co., the
leading commercial printer in North America.
   Carmichael said the only wild card could be if Meredith uses
proceeds from the sale of Meredith-Burda for another investment.
   ``They will have a lot of cash. They have not been good
investors,'' he said.
   He said Meredith could be interested in Woman's Day magazine,
which Diamandis Communications Inc. put up for sale earlier this
week.
   Meredith magazine group spokesman Rick Phillips declined to
comment about Woman's Day, saying the company doesn't speculate on
possible acquisitions.

<HEAD>Insurance Industry Wants More Info On Insurance Futures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Insurance industry officials are reacting
cautiously to the Chicago Board of Trade's plan to introduce
insurance futures contracts.
   The exchange says the innovative products would provide a
measure of price protection to the insurance industry and help
lower consumer costs for health care, health insurance and car
insurance.
   But people within the insurance industry say they need to hear
more about the proposed contracts. And the Board of Trade is
keeping a lid on details while it prepares an application for
regulatory approval.
   ``Until they cough up some details, we're just going to sit
tight and see what develops,'' said Cheryl Van Tilburg, spokeswoman
for the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association _ the nation's
largest health insurer.
   Spokeswoman Georgiana Smith of the Washington-based American
Insurance Asssocation agreed: ``I think we're going to have to wait
until they actually come out with what they've developed.''
   The proposed contracts _ one for health insurance and one for
auto insurance _ would require the approval of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency that regulates
futures trading.
   The Board of Trade did not provide details of the proposed
contracts in its announcement Wednesday, citing competition within
the futures industry.
   Richard Sandor, a former Board of Trade economist who helped
design the proposed contracts, said insurance and reinsurance
companies could use the contracts to hedge against price swings in
their dealings with each other.
   Reinsurance is the practice among insurance carriers of selling
policies to other insurers to spread the risk around.
   A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a commodity or
basket of commodities at some future date for a price agreed upon
in advance.
   An insurance futures contract might represent a basket of
insurance policies maturing at the same time, futures industry
officials said. By trading these contracts, insurance and
reinsurance companies could lock in certain costs and revenues in
advance, thus reducing their exposure to price changes.
   The savings they realize from reduced risk could be passed on to
consumers in the form of lower insurance premiums, supporters said.
   Sandor is considered one of the architects of interest-rate
futures, which are widely used by banks and institutional
investors. Those contracts, along with various other financial
futures products, are responsible for a huge increase in futures
trading volume since they were introduced in the late 1970s and
early 1980s.
   ``These new contracts could be as major an innovation as
interest-rate futures,'' Sandor said.
   ``The insurance business is an extremely risky business,'' said
Board of Trade Chairman Karsten Mahlmann. ``There is a tremendous
need out there.''
   Sandor conceded the exchange faces an ``enormous task'' of
educating the insurance industry on how to use futures markets.
   Christian Milton, the head of reinsurance buying for the New
York-based American International Group, said he would like to be
able to lock in prices. But he and others questioned whether the
Board of Trade could design a standardized reinsurance agreement on
which to base trading.
   ``There just isn't any standard reinsurance arrangement,'' said
Robert Faber, a reinsurance executive at the Allstate Insurance Co.
   ``Each time we go back to renegotiate, our client companies may
have a higher appetite for risk or lower,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Gains Against Yen, Stocks Down in Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar edged higher against the yen today,
while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index ended the week slightly
lower.
   The dollar closed at 152.90 yen, up 0.90 yen from Thursday's
152-yen finish. The currency opened at 152.30 yen and gradually
strengthened while trading between 152.25 yen and 153.15 yen.
   The U.S. currency quickly rose early in the day as market
players bought the West German mark and sold the yen. It also
gained strength from dollar-buying by Japanese institutional
investors, said Masao Kanemaru, a dealer with Fuji Bank.
   Dealers said a wider-than-expected $8.45 billion U.S. trade
deficit in March, announced by the Commerce Department in
Washington on Thursday, had little impact on exchange rates.
   The March figures were within the range of earlier expectations
and had been factored into market, they said.
   Some $9.5 billion changed hands in spot trading, down from
Thursday's $11.4 billion.
   The dollar's slight surge does not mean the yen has stopped
gaining strength, said Fuji Bank's Kanemaru. ``Market players
generally believe the dollar will still remain weak, and move
narrowly a little above 150 yen until there is major
market-affecting news,'' he said.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said today the yen was
gradually regaining stability. World foreign exchange stability was
crucial for reducing global trade imbalances, he said.
   In stock dealings, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost 47.88
points, or 0.15 percent, ending the week at 32,013.72. The index,
which gained 93.98 points Thursday, rose about 140 points in early
trading before falling back.
   Yoshio Ogawa, stock department director at Nikko Securities Co.
attributed the index's decline to a larger-than-expected increase
in money supply, as well as the market's wait-and-see mood ahead of
the weekend.
   The Bank of Japan reported today that growth in Japan's broad
money supply, M-2 plus certificates of deposit, surged in April to
an average pace of 13.6 percent, the fastest increase since
December 1976, when it grew 13.8 percent.
   ``Due to renewed concern about inflation and the possibility of
higher interest rates, market players stepped off to the
sidelines,'' Ogawa said.
   Rapid growth in money supply is a sign of inflationary pressure.
   Trading was directionless as market players constantly shifted
their targets from one issue to another, said Yamaichi Securities
trader Kozo Hasunuma.
   ``The yen's slip and investors' reluctance to make major moves
ahead of the weekend prompted the decline,'' he said.
   Today's trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at
480 million shares, down from 580 million Thursday.
   In the bond market, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond fell to 87.61 points as of 4 p.m., down
from Thursday's close of 87.80. Its yield rose to 7.04 percent, up
from the previous day's 7 percent.

<BYLINE>Daniel B. Burke Named New Capital Cities-ABC Chief
^By ANDREW FRASER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Daniel B. Burke has been elected to
replace Thomas S. Murphy as head of Capital Cities-ABC Inc., the
company announced.
   Burke's appointment, effective June 1, was approved unanimously
by the company's board of directors, which met in Bristol following
the company's annual meeting Thursday.
   Burke, 61, served as Murphy's chief assistant for 19 years, 14
of them at Capital Cities Communications Inc., which bought
American Broadcasting Cos. for $3.5 billion in 1985.
   Murphy announced in January he would step down June 1, a day
after his 65th birthday. He will stay on as chairman of the
company, but will not be involved in its day-to-day operations.
   Burke joined Capital Cities Communications Inc. in 1961 as
general manager of WTEN-TV, Albany, and was elected vice president
in 1962. Two years later, he was appointed general manager of
WJR-AM@FM in Detroit.
   Burke rose to the rank of executive vice president and director
in 1967. From 1969 to 1972, he served as president of the company's
publishing division before being named president and chief
operating officer. He continued in that position when Capital
Cities took over ABC in 1985.
   Before going to Capital Cities, Burke worked for the Jello
division of General Foods. He attended the University of Vermont
and Harvard University's business school.
   Analysts believe the transition will have little immediate
impact because Murphy and Burke share virtually identical
philosophies about the operation and role of the company.
   When he announced that he was stepping aside, Murphy said he
believed a corporation prospers under younger leadership.
   Murphy became renowned in 1985 when his company took over ABC.
The move marked the first takeover of a major television network.
   Murphy, the son of a New York trial court judge, joined Capital
Cities as a manager when it was founded in Albany, N.Y., in 1954.
   The Brooklyn native, who attended Cornell University and Harvard
University's business school, was elected a director in 1957,
president in 1964, and chairman two years later.
   Murphy began his career in 1946 as an industrial oil salesman
with what became Texaco Inc. He later worked as an account
executive at Kenyon &amp; Eckhardt Inc., a New York advertising agency
and as a product manager and merchandising manager for Lever
Brothers Co., a subsidiary of the Anglo-Dutch consumer products
giant Unilever.
   Along the way, Murphy befriended investor Warren Buffett, now
the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., who made the ABC deal
possible by putting up $500 million in exchange for an 18 percent
stake in the new media giant and a seat on its board.

<HEAD>Major Banks Attack AT&amp;T Charge Card</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four major banks are complaining to federal
regulators that American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. is illegally
marketing a combined general credit card and phone calling card.
   The banks, in filings with the Federal Communications
Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal
Reserve, said the phone giant is trying to act like a bank without
being subject to banking laws and that it is improperly offering
discounted long-distance calling as an inducement to gain customers.
   One of the banks, San Francisco-based BankAmerica Corp., said
Thursday it wanted only a level playing field in order to compete
against ``a non-banking company with tremendous market presence
(that) is in practical effect directly offering a banking service
without being sujbect to banking laws and bank regulatory
oversight.''
   In their FCC filing, the banks said that by offering 10 percent
long-distance discounts to holders of its AT&amp;T Universal Card, the
telephone giant was illegally discriminating against other AT&amp;T
customers.
   AT&amp;T, which in March began offering its calling card customers a
combined phone card-Visa or phone card-MasterCard, called the
banks' allegations ``absolutely without merit.''
   The FCC filing cited published reports estimating that AT&amp;T
could have 5 million customers for its credit card by the end of
this year, with a total portfolio estimated at $5 billion.
   Credit card industry officials have said that consumers loaded
down with bulging wallets full of plastic probably would find a
combined credit card attractive _ and put big pressure on
traditional bank cards.
   Doug Jones, the FDIC's deputy general counsel, said the banks _
BankAmerica, Citicorp, MBNA America Bank and Chase Manhattan Corp.
_ were ``alleging banking violations.'' He would not elaborate.
   FDIC spokesman David Barr said the banks had sent a 53-page
petition to the agency Tuesday, with a 10-page cover letter to FDIC
Chairman L. William Seidman. AT&amp;T spokesman Jim McGann said the
banks also filed a complaint with the Georgia state banking
commission.
   The banks told the FCC that AT&amp;T was charging discriminatory
phone rates; had failed to have the 10 percent discount approved;
failed to file tariffs for finance charges and late charges imposed
on the card users; and discriminated against other credit card
holders in access to phone service.
   Peter Gallagher, senior vice president for corporate and
consumer affairs at AT&amp;T Universal Card Services Corp., said AT&amp;T
was not violating telephone rules because the card was being
offered through an unregulated business, the bank.
   ``We anticipated these questions,'' Gallagher said, ``but we did
our homework'' before offering the card in March. ``I'm absolutely
confident we are in total compliance with the appropriate laws,
rules and regulations.''
   As a so-called dominant carrier AT&amp;T must receive approval from
the FCC for all its telecommunications prices and contracts.
   But Gallagher said AT&amp;T's agreement with Universal Bank, a
subsidiary of Synovus Financial Corp. of Columbus, Ga., called for
the bank to purchase ``the receivables that are due for the calls
charged to the universal bank card at the full, tariffed rate. So
there is no discount, there is no discrimination, and the Universal
Bank bills and collects for those receivables and has decided to do
it at a 10 percent discount rate.''
   He acknowleged that Universal Bank was established solely to
service the credit card.
   ``I don't know for a fact ... that they're precluded from doing
anything but that. I don't think that's the case at all,''
Gallagher added.
   Gallagher also rejected the banks' assertion that Universal Bank
was acting as a reseller of phone services, which also would fall
under FCC regulation, and that the Universal Card discriminated
against non-AT&amp;T credit card holders who try to use AT&amp;T coinless
pay phones.
   ``We are not going to be deterred by any diversionary tactics,''
Gallagher said. ``We're committed to the credit card business.
We're here to stay.''
   While refusing to divulge any subscription figures for the card,
Gallagher said the response ``has been wonderful.''
   He said AT&amp;T received 250,000 inquiries about the card in the
first 24 hours after it was offered.
   He said demand was running 250 percent ahead of what the company
had forecast.

   Is ``Moo'' too close to ``Mooo?''
   That's what a state court is being asked to decide in a suit
filed by Lubbock restaurant operator Yet Inc. against its parent
chain, Georgia-based Western Sizzlin' Inc.
   Yet, which operates two Bob York's Western Sizzlin' restaurants,
filed suit against Western Sizzlin', charging that the chain has
begun using ``Moo'' on a number of advertising properties while Yet
has been using the ``Mooo'' slogan as its trademark since 1984.
   Attorneys for Yet claimed in the suit filed Wednesday that the
firm created the ``Mooo'' slogan in 1984 and has used it on a
variety of  words or phrases.
   The Lubbock firm asked the court to rule that Yet has protected
service mark and trademark rights to the word and sound ``Mooo''
and that it should be awarded damages including lost profits
because of the alleged violation.
   No specific amount of monetary damages were specified in the
suit.

<HEAD>Xerox To Introduce Electronic Copiers For the 1990s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILARY APPELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Xerox Corp. will introduce a line of
electronic copiers later this year that will set the pace for the
company in the next decade, officials said at the annual
shareholders meeting.
   Xerox officials divulged little Thursday about the new
``multi-function'' products, other than to say they will use
digital scanners rather than the light lenses used by most copiers.
   The new line is being developed in Rochester, where most of the
Stamford, Conn.-based company's operations are located. The
products will ``allow all kinds of information to be easily
translated into a digital stream that enables images to be
combined, printed at the most convenient location and even filed
electronically,'' said President Paul A. Allaire.
   ``We think this is the wave of the future,'' said Chairman David
Kearns.
   Other companies already offer digital imaging products, in which
documents are transformed into computer code that can be
electronically stored and manipulated. It was unclear how the
planned Xerox products would compare with these.
   Officials also said at the meeting that Xerox profits will be
down in 1990 because of its troubled real estate and insurance
subsidiaries, despite growth in earnings at its business equipment
and systems division.
   The company took a $400 million write-off in the first quarter
because of financial problems at VMS Realty Partners of Chicago, in
which Xerox had invested more than $500 million. That write-off was
the main reason Xerox reported a $254 million loss in the first
quarter.
   Kearns said the company does not expect any other write-offs in
connection with VMS.
   ``That's over, we're out of that business,'' he said.
   Xerox will remain in the financial services business, but will
``review our financial services strategy to ensure that we
concentrate our resources exclusively in those businesses which
will add profit growth and value to our shareholders,'' Kearns said.
   Xerox's insurance business, Crum and Forster Inc., suffered a 56
percent drop in income in the first quarter. The business, however,
is ``positioned well for improved profits when the insurance cycle
turns up,'' Kearns said.
   In April, Xerox sold its personal insurance business.
   In other business at the meeting, shareholders rejected a
proposal that Xerox completely withdraw from South Africa by no
longer providing materials, products, services or technology to
that country.
   Shareholders also defeated a proposal that the company adopt the
MacBride principles, equal employment opportunity guidelines for
companies operating in Northern Ireland.

<HEAD>Drive to Boost Capital of Government Agencies Could Hit Home
Buyers, Others</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM BUERKLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deleveraging may be the buzzword as the 1980s
debt boom gives way to a more prudent era in finance, but the trend
could mean higher borrowing costs for home buyers, students and
farmers.
   Federal officials seeking to prevent another debacle like the
savings and loan collapse are urging Congress to tighten capital
requirements for government-sponsored enterprises that have
hundreds of billions of dollars in loans outstanding.
   GSEs like the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie
Mae), the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae) and the
Farm Credit System were established and chartered by the federal
government in recent decades to steer credit to housing, education
and agriculture.
   The agencies are private corporations, but because they were set
up under federal sponsorship and designed to foster public goals,
most investors regard them as having the Treasury's implicit
guarantee against default.
   That's what has Congress and the Treasury concerned. After all,
federal guarantees of thrift deposits are widely perceived as
having encouraged freewheeling lending by S&amp;Ls and led to the
bailout that could cost taxpayers up to $500 billion.
   ``The market's perception of federal backing for GSEs weakens
the normal relationship between the availability and cost of funds
to the GSEs and the risks that these enterprises assume,'' Robert
Glauber, undersecretary of the Treasury for finance, told a House
Ways and Means subcommittee last week.
   That perception also lets the agencies provide more loans with
the same amount of capital backing than other commercial lenders.
That is ``very similar to problems of excessive risk-taking that
occurred in the thrift industry,'' Glauber said.
   To pad its cushion against risk, the Treasury wants to require
the agencies to maintain enough capital to obtain a triple-A rating
_ the peak of creditworthiness _ based on their balance sheets
alone and not the implicit guarantee. If an agency doesn't,
Congress should sever the guarantee, the Treasury says.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., a leading credit rater, has suggested
to Congress that most of the agencies would fall short of triple A.
   For Sallie Mae, the difference is probably small, S&amp;P said. For
Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac),
it's more substantial. The Farm Credit System probably would get
only a high `junk' rating, S&amp;P said.
   For all of them, one thing seems clear. ``They would have to
reduce the amount of financial leverage they have right now,'' says
Thomas Gillis, a managing director at S&amp;P.
   Take the biggest agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They buy
home mortgages, holding some in their portfolios and packaging the
rest as securities for sale to investors.
   The two agencies own or have repackaged about $650 billion in
mortgages, a quarter of the nation's total. They're also growing
fast. Today they purchase more than half of all new mortgages.
   Yet for every dollar of exposure, Fannie Mae has just 1.1 cent
in equity and reserves. Freddie Mac a little under a penny.
Commercial banks are in the process of boosting their equity
capital ratio to 4 cents.
   Raising capital will increase the cost of doing business for the
agencies. ``To the extent that their costs are increased, it will
get passed through to homebuyers,'' predicts Andrew Carron, manager
of research for mortgage-backed securities at First Boston Corp.
   Fannie Mae plans to add at least $2 billion in capital this year
and next by retaining earnings, says Timothy Howard, chief
financial officer. But if Congress enacts tougher capital
requirements, Howard says it could slow the agency's growth,
reducing a key supply of funds to the mortgage market.
   Freddie Mac President Leland C. Brendsel doesn't concede the
need for more capital. He says his operations are less risky than a
bank or S&amp;L.
   Freddie Mac won't buy a mortgage bigger than about $187,000, for
example, and it requires 20 percent down payments. It and Fannie
Mae have insurance on many mortgages from third parties, and their
holdings are spread across the country, so they shouldn't get
whacked by plunging home prices in the Southwest or Northeast.
Indeed, Freddie Mac's earnings rose in every year of the '80s.
   ``Too much capital is bad, just as too little capital is bad,''
Brendsel says. If Congress toughens requirements too much, he says,
the price ``will be paid ultimately by home buyers in the mortgage
rates they pay.''
   Albert Lord, chief financial officer at Sallie Mae, questions
why the Treasury wants the agencies to be triple-As when none of
the nation's major commercial banks are rated that highly. ``It
would certainly be a very different standard than any other company
operates under,'' he says.
   In the end, the decision will be a political one as much as an
economic one, says Gillis of S&amp;P.
   ``There's always a compromise that you have to have between
safety and public purpose,'' he says. If the Treasury wants more
security against another big bailout, he adds, public purpose in
the form of cheap mortgages and farm loans are likely to suffer.

<NOTE>Eds: Subs graf 3, White House, to CORRECT billion to trillion.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Budget negotiators should limit next year's
deficit cuts to $50 billion to $60 billion, far less than the law
requires, say top fiscal experts for Congress and the Bush
administration.
   The advice, if followed, would make it easier _ and less
politically painful _ for participants in the budget summit to
reach a deficit-reduction deal for 1991.
   White House officials and congressional leaders met in the
Capitol Thursday for their second round of talks on the $1.2
trillion budget for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1.
   That spending plan will have to contain an enormous amount of
taxes or spending cuts to meet the $64 billion deficit ceiling
mandated by the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law.
   At Thursday's session, negotiators did not agree on what size of
budget-cutting package they need.
   ``It's bouncing all over the ballpark, $60 billion, $45 billion,
$50 billion,'' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser,
D-Tenn.
   Their own analysts gave them wildly differing figures about the
size of the looming shortfall.
   The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said next year's
budget gap looks like it will be $149 billion to $159 billion. That
would mean savings _ either new taxes or spending slashes _ of $85
billion to $95 billion to shrink the shortfall to the Gramm-Rudman
target of $64 billion.
   The White House's Office of Management and Budget projected a
shortfall of $123 billion to $138 billion. That would necessitate
$59 billion to $74 billion in cuts to hit the Gramm-Rudman ceiling.
   Neither set of figures includes the cost of rescuing the
country's savings and loan institutions, a bailout that could cost
the government tens of billions of dollars next year.
   Yet according to participants, CBO Director Robert Reischauer
and OMB Director Richard Darman agreed that savings should be
limited to $50 billion to $60 billion.
   The two budget experts said deficit cuts exceeding that amount
could slow an already weak economy. Many economists worry that
taking more than that amount away from consumers and government
contractors _ in the form of higher taxes or spending cuts _ could
prompt a recession.
   Some negotiators have said that loosening the deficit targets in
the Gramm-Rudman law could be one way of keeping automatic cuts
from taking effect.
   Darman also presented negotiators with examples of the spending
cuts the Gramm-Rudman law would impose next year if Congress and
President Bush fail to enact a deficit-reduction plan. The law
would trigger enough cuts to reduce the deficit to $64 billion.
   According to the budget chief, $30 billion in Gramm-Rudman cuts
would mean a 10.4 percent cut in domestic programs and a 7.6
percent reduction in defense spending. A $60 billion cutback would
pare domestic programs by 22.2 percent and defense by 15.2 percent.
   In January, Bush released a proposed budget asserting that only
$37 billion in savings would be needed to reach the Gramm-Rudman
deficit target.
   The administration says that since that time, projected costs of
aiding the savings and loan industry have grown, interest rates
have jumped and tax collections have dropped. Democrats point out
that CBO and many private economists have been expecting the higher
deficit figures for months.
   The budget talks are expected to last weeks or months. Both
sides are being cautious in suggesting how to cope with a problem
that could mean unpopular tax increases or spending reductions in
an election year.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Turn Lower After Strong Opening</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices turned lower
after a mostly higher opening this morning on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   Analysts said the selling reflected pre-weekend profit-taking
and position-evening, some of it by traders who had participated in
the buying that boosted prices across the board on Thursday.
   The crop markets were expected to trade on either side of
unchanged today. William Biedermann, research director with the
commodities brokerage Allendale Inc., said today's early strength
was partly a reaction to increased export sales of U.S. grains and
soybeans last week as reported by the Agriculture Department on
Thursday.
   Weather forecasts also were mainly supportive, Biedermann said.
More rain was expected this weekend in the soaked winter wheat
fields of the Southern Plains and in the Midwest, where rain has
delayed corn planting.
   ``The way the weather forecast looks, it will be late next week
before farmers in Southern Illinois will be able to get into their
fields,'' he said. ``We're definitely looking at corn yield
reductions.''
   The wet Midwestern weather could lead to increased soybean
plantings, though, if farmers waiting out the rain decide to shift
planned corn acreage into beans.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1{ cents to 2{ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in May at $3.87 a bushel; corn
futures were \ cent to 2\ cents lower with May at $2.86{ a bushel;
oats were unchanged to 4{ cents lower with May at $1.54{ a bushel;
soybeans were 1 cent to 5{ cents lower with May at $6.16 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .20 cent to .55 cent higher with June at 74.40
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent to .68 cent higher with
May at 85.50 cents a pound; hogs were .40 cent lower to .18 cent
higher with June at 66.27 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.70 cent lower to 1.58 cents higher with Mawy at 67.80 cents a
pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on Thursday; pork futures were
mostly higher.

   Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn King
today defended her agency against frequent criticism that people
have trouble getting adequate service from the agency and often get
bad advice.
   ``The employees of Social Security care about their jobs and
care about the quality of their work,'' Mrs. King told the Special
Senate Committee on Aging. ``My goal is to build upon their record
of success and raise (the agency's) level of service to even
greater heights.''
   Mrs. King said she welcomes constructive criticism but vowed to
``avoid having our course disrupted by criticism that serves no
constructive purpose.''
   She was more blunt in an interview just one day earlier, when
she lashed out at congressional critics for a steady stream of
criticism that she said has been counterproductive in some cases.
   ``Talk is easy,'' she said in an interview Thursday with The
Associated Press. ``It's harder to make a difference.''
   Mrs. King said she found it ``particularly galling'' that
congressional critics have been soliciting horror stories from
Social Security caseworkers.
   ``You have to look at the big picture and not focus on all the
anecdotes that you can muster,'' she said in the interview.
``Social Security is, across the board, serving people, answering
telephones, handling problems and it's amazing to me how well
they're doing.''
   The agency, whose staff was slashed by 20 percent during the
Reagan administration, has been faulted for declining service,
providing inaccurate information and frequent busy signals on its
toll-free telephone network.
   Mrs. King, who took over the agency in August, said her
frustration was not aimed solely at Congress. She alluded to
negative media coverage of the agency and cited disgruntled
employees who come in ``with gripes and criticism that may have
been relevant a year ago.''
   ``From every sector you will find people zeroing in on a
microcosm of problems, anecdotal in nature and certainly needing
fixing,'' Mrs. King said. ``While we care about every single person
... I do have to keep the big picture in mind.''
   Mrs. King said she welcomes constructive criticism. But she
expressed concern that unfair reports could undermine public
confidence in Social Security.
   ``You're going to get people frightened and concerned about
whether the system is going to be there to serve them,'' she said.
``The impression left of a stumbling, inept agency down on its
knees is one that really does translate into a real problem.''
   She also expressed concern for hard-working employees who ``pick
up the newspaper every day and find that somebody is leveling them
for something that they all know is a very small portion of all the
work that's done.''
   ``It bothers me, and it's fair to say it bothers people at
Social Security, that we always seem to get dumped on and nobody
ever takes the time to say, `You know, that was a good job,''' Mrs.
King said.
   She invited her critics ``to be a part of the solution and not
just a part of the griping problem.''
   Mrs. King said the agency had improved its operations over the
past year, sharply reduced the busy signals on its toll-free 800
number and hired 500 workers to address staffing shortages.
   A study by the inspector general of the Department of Health and
Human Services found a large majority of Social Security clients
surveyed called the service helpful and accurate, she said.
   She criticized several legislative proposals, including a bill
to separate the Social Security Administration from HHS. She said
another proposal to require that local Social Security office phone
numbers, not just the 800 number, be listed in telephone books was
``specious'' and ``trite.''
   ``Surely the U.S. Congress has more important business to get
about,'' she said.

   The stock market pulled back today, running into

<HEAD>Share Prices Retreat in Active Trading</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with closing figures.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices fell in active trading Friday on the
London Stock Exchange as the market consolidated from Thursday's
impressive rally.
   The key Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index on
Thursday made its sharpest daily gain in more than two years,
finishing up 63.3 points, or 2.85 percent, at 2,284.4. On Friday,
it closed down 15.3 points, or 0.67 percent, at 2,269.1, a touch
above its low for the day of 2,268.5.
   ``Everyone said it would be a day of consolidation, and that's
what happened,'' commented senior dealer Paul Corbett of the
Panmure Gordon Ltd. brokerage.
   The Financial Times 30-share index ended 2.4 points lower at
1,793.3. Volume was a healthy 594.8 million shares, down from 645.4
million the day before. The Financial Times 500-share index was
down 6.06 at 1,223.79.
   In the futures market, the June FT-SE 100 index contract
finished at 2,295.0, down from 2,329.0 Thursday.
   Although the 100-share index in the cash market started the
session well ahead on strong stock-index futures contracts and
firmness in the underlying shares, profit taking and a retreat of
institutional investors trimmed share prices, dealers said.
   In addition, a weak opening on Wall Street, which has recently
had greater influence than usual on London's performance, helped
shave the gains.
   Thursday's rally was largely driven by rumors that the pound
would enter the European Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism
shortly. Although Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major reiterated
late Thursday that entry was still months away and lower inflation
was a precondition, dealers in London said investors took heart at
what they felt was a further indication of the government's intent
to fully join the EMS.
   Most traders were optimistic about the market's potential in the
short term, anticipating a drifting in prices for several days and
then another rally, although probably not as dramatic as Thursday's
63.3-point surge.

<HEAD>Perot Signs Consulting Contract With IBM</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billionaire H. Ross Perot has hooked up again with
an old boss, signing on to provide consulting services to IBM.
   Under the agreement, Perot Systems Corp. will advise
International Business Machines Corp. how to best expand its
computer processing and services organization.
   ``As we started enlarging our computer service unit, we realized
we needed to learn more about this business,'' said Bill Wilson,
general manager of IBM's systems services unit in its national
services division. ``We're trying to tap into as many sources as we
can to learn the dynamics of the industry.
   ``The first thing Perot is giving us is advice on the business
and how to operate a business in it,'' Wilson added. ``They're
showing us how to build a management structure to meet the
requirements to grow in this field.''
   Perot Systems President Pat Horner refused to disclose the terms
of the deal with IBM, saying the company does not discuss its
contract awards.
   Analysts suggested the agreement is designed to help both
companies compete better against Dallas-based Electronic Data
Systems Corp., Perot's former company, which dominates the field of
providing corporate data processing and putting together computer
networks for large businesses.
   Perot, who once was a successful IBM computer salesman, sold EDS
to General Motors Corp. in 1986 for $2 billion and GM stock, which
the automaker later repurchased for $700 million to remove Perot
from the company after repeated clashes with GM Chairman Roger
Smith.
   The billionaire then created Perot Systems to compete with EDS.
   IBM, best known as a manufacturer of computer hardware, launched
its effort to provide computer processing and consulting services
two years ago. It now provides computer services for several major
clients including Eastman Kodak Co. and Hibernia Corp.
   The agreement may help both sides generate more business, said
Stephen McClellan, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New York.
IBM may be able to share customer leads developed by its large
sales force, while Perot Systems can lend credibility to IBM's
service offerings, McClellan said.
   ``For IBM, it's like getting the Good Housekeeping seal of
approval,'' he said.
   But Perot also may be helping a potential future competitor in
the computer services industry, McClellan said.

<HEAD>Sources Say Shearson Expected To Announce Facelift</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., coping with recent
management upheaval and big losses, is expected to reorganize by
uncoupling its investment banking and brokerage operations and
possibly changing its name, company sources said Friday.
   The plan, which is likely to be announced by month's end, could
help rehabilitate the image of the troubled American Express Co.
unit, whose losses neared $1 billion last quarter, company
executives familiar with the proposed realignment said.
   Shearson is the nation's second-largest securities company
behind Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. It grew by leaps and bounds in the boom
years of the 1980s but has faced increasing financial and
management problems in the aftermath of the 1987 stock market crash.
   Under the proposed reorganization, the company's various
divisions would be split between two new operating units, according
to the company sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The retail brokerage and asset management businesses would be
combined into one unit, which would include about 10,000
stockbrokers catering to individual investment needs, the sources
said. It would probably retain the Shearson name, they said.
   The other unit would focus on corporate finance, including the
firm's investment banking and capital markets operations, and could
operate under the resurrected name of Lehman Brothers, once one of
the most trusted names on Wall Street.
   Sherman R. Lewis Jr., currently head of investment and merchant
banking, and Richard S. Fuld Jr., head of capital markets, are
likely to head that unit, they said.
   The parent company probably would also change its name, to
either Shearson Lehman Holdings Inc. or SLH Holdings Inc., with the
two separate divisions under it, the sources said.
   Steven Faigen, a spokesman for Shearson, said he couldn't
confirm or deny the reorganization plans.
   ``At this time the firm is examining a number of options that
would result in a more customer-driven organizational structure,''
he said Friday. ``But we haven't made any decision on exactly how
we'll move ahead on that score.''
   Securities analysts said reorganizing would be a positive step
for Shearson, which has struggled to integrate its numerous
acquisitions over the years.
   ``It would give it a new identity,'' said Perrin Long, of Lipper
Analytical Services Inc.
   Long added that such a plan might also make it easier for
American Express, which has a controlling stake in Shearson, to
sell the firm some time down the line. American Express has denied
it has any plans to sell Shearson or any of its parts.
   In addition, Long said that by reviving the Lehman Brothers name
for its investment bank, Shearson ``could help to keep good people
within the old Lehman organization.''
   Shearson, formerly known as Shearson-American Express, acquired
Lehman Brothers, Kuhn Loeb Inc. in 1984. The merged Shearson Lehman
purchased E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. in 1988.
   The proposed reorganization reportedly has been in the works
since Howard L. Clark Jr., a former American Express official,
became Shearson chairman earlier this year, replacing Peter A.
Cohen, who resigned.
   Clark was unavailable for comment, Shearson officials said.
   During the first three months of 1990, Shearson lost $915
million _ the largest in securities industry history _ mostly to
pay for a restructuring that included 2,000 layoffs and business
cuts initiated by American Express.
   American Express, which currently owns 61 percent of Shearson,
recently signed an agreement to buy the rest of its outstanding
common shares. American Express was forced to inject more than $1
billion into Shearson to shore up its finances.

   The hottest investment in Tokyo this year is cash.
   With uncertainty in Japan's stock and bond markets, many
investment managers have sought shelter for their money. They are
finding it in Tokyo's overnight money markets, short-term
certificates of deposit and other interest-bearing cash
investments, brokers and analysts say.
   While the rush to cash investments is paying short-term
dividends to investors, some experts fear it could swell the money
supply and pressure interest rates higher around the world.
   ``People are hiding in cash and CDs from all of the unpleasant
possibilities,'' said William H. Brown, president the investment
advisory firm of Scudder Stevens and Clark (Overseas).
   The rate for unsecured overnight call loans, the shortest-term
cash investment, has been above 7 percent recently, hovering just
about 0.2 percentage points under the yield of the benchmark
10-year Japanese government bond.
   Three-month certificates of deposit yielded as high as 7.50
percent recently, compared with 6.84 percent at the beginning of
the year. In April 1989, 3-month CD yields were 4.58 percent.
   Such high rates offer investors a rewarding hedge for their
money while market turbulence continues. Stock prices remain more
than 20 percent below their levels at the beginning of the year.
   The situation recalls the run for cover by many American
investors, who sought the safety of cash investment following the
1987 market collapse.
   ``Who wants to be the first to stick out their neck by taking a
stand, when you can get those kinds of rates on the overnight
calls?'' said one dealer, who asked not to be identified. ``If I'm
20 percent in cash and you're 40 percent in cash and the equities
market crashes again, who wins? You do.''
   At County NatWest Securities, analyst David Threadgold remarked,
``I'd be very surprised if a lot more money weren't going into
cash.''
   As a result, Japan's money supply is far above a level justified
by its economy, in the view of the official Bank of Japan.
   The broad money supply, which includes short-term investments
like CDs, rose 11.7 percent from January through March. In that
period, the stock market lost a quarter of its value, the yen lost
more than 10 percent vs. the dollar, and government bond prices
dropped to about 85 percent of their face value.
   The central bank had forecast only a 9 percent expansion of the
money supply for the quarter. Bank of Japan officials said a major
cause of the ``excessive'' growth was the ``merry-go-round'' of
funds through cash instruments as investors darted in and out of
various markets.
   The bank said prices remained stable, but the cash glut shows no
sign of abating and could eventually heat up inflation. The central
bank is now predicting 11 percent money growth for the March-May
quarter.
   ``It means more inflation, and that will result in higher
interest rates whether the Bank of Japan does anything about it or
not,'' Brown said.
   The fear of still higher interest rates both in Japan and abroad
will limit any stock market rally, many analysts said.
   ``The market believes rates are going higher. West Germany will
have to raise rates to deal with East Germany. That will set off
another round of world hikes,'' said one.
   Mitsuhiko Kinugasa, a currency dealer with Daiwa Bank, said the
yen's recent rise resulted partly from life insurers selling U.S.
Treasury bonds and converting the proceeds into yen for short-term
investment in Japan.
   An insurance company fund manager, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said, ``The rates in Tokyo now are undeniably
attractive.''

<HEAD>New Goods for Struggling Chrysler: The Viper Sports Car</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 8 grafs to UPDATE with Viper announcement, quotes.
Picks up 9th graf pvs, `Chrysler also ...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. officially announced today it
will produce its pricey Dodge Viper sports car, with the first 200
of the Corvette competitors to be available in the 1992 model year.
   Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca said the Viper, which debuted in
prototype form at the Detroit auto show in January 1989, was
expected to generate 400 horsepower from its all-new V-10 engine
and would cost ``under $50,000.'' He wouldn't be more exact about
the price.
   Iacocca said his engineers told him they believed the sleek
convertible, with an integrated roll bar and exhaust pipes built
into a cutaway side, will be able to go from 0 to 60 mph in 3.9
seconds. It will reach a top speed of 188 mph.
   Chrysler officials at a news conference said they eventually
expect to produce about 5,000 Vipers a year, to be sold at 300 to
500 U.S. dealerships.
   Iacocca said developing the Viper had cost Chrysler ``tens and
tens of millions _ not hundreds of millions,'' adding it can make
money for the company at a sales pace of 5,000 cars a year.
   Among the team that came up with the Viper concept was Chrysler
consultant Carroll Shelby, the father of the popular Shelby Cobras.
   Chrysler says the Viper is the first product produced by a
computer-driven ``conceptual design and rendering system,'' which
is supposed to cut by 25 percent the time it takes to bring a
totally new car to market.
   Iacocca said the Viper would be made in this country, but he was
not more specific.
   Chrysler also is working on a new line of sleek, mid-size cars
and an additional model for its profitable Jeep line, among other
vehicles.
   Today's news conference caps a six-city tour promoting the
quality of Chrysler cars. Iacocca claims they now equal Japanese
models and are the safest on the road.
   He told shareholders the company's $15.6 billion, five-year
product development plan would pay off.
   ``I think we've got a good program. We'll come back in the next
six months,'' he said after the meeting in Universal City.
   Iacocca acknowledged at the meeting that the company's
difficulties have hurt its share price.
   ``Nobody in this room is more frustrated than I am at our stock
sitting there at about $17 a share today,'' he said. ``Hell, that
means the stock is less than half the book value of the company.
And it's half a billion less than the cash we have in the bank.''
   Nevertheless, he said the company is much stronger than a decade
ago, when it survived only because the government co-signed its
loans. Chrysler has much more cash, far less debt and a bigger
market share than it did in 1980, he said.
   He denied that his latest ad campaign constituted Japan-bashing,
saying he never said a word against the Japanese people or the
high-quality products they produce, but only against their trade
practices and the U.S. government for allowing them.
   ``The fact is, `Japan bashing' is a headline or a TV sound-bite
that's become a code word for racism,'' Iacocca said. He said he
would not be intimidated by such ``gutter innuendo.''
   ``Sorry to say, it seems to come with the territory these days
if you're an American trying to peddle your wares and you have the
audacity to say they're as good as what the Japanese have to
offer.''

   David and Merry Roe's hair salon, the Shears
Tower, is being clipped by Sears, Roebuck and Co., which says the
Roes are infringing on the giant retailer's trademark.
   ``We're just a small shop,'' David Roe said Friday as he styled
a customer's hair. ``We put a lot of money into building the
business and a lot of money in the new name, new business cards and
new checks. I don't want to go through all that expense again.''
   But Sears says it has a lot at stake, too.
   ``We've worked hard to build that name and have it mean
something,'' company spokesman Lewis Smith said. ``It doesn't help
to have any dilution of that name.''
   The company's legal department has written the Roes a letter,
telling them Shears Tower must find a new name for the store in
suburban Naperville or risk infringing on the company's rights.
   Roe, 30, said he and his wife changed the salon's name in
January when they moved the five-employee shop off the suburb's
Main Street.
   ``We didn't want to be called Main Street Hair because we were
no longer on Main Street,'' Roe explained.
   After brainstorming unsuccessfully on a new name, his younger
brother, Dale, finally hit on Shears Tower _ because at three
stories, the building housing their new salon is the tallest around.
   ``We thought, at first, it was a joke,'' Roe said. ``But then
our customers said, `Hey, we like that.'''
   They came up with a new logo _ a ``generic skyline'' with a pair
of scissors set in front of it _ imprinted it on new cards and on
their checks and opened up shop.
   Roe said they went to great lengths _ even consulting lawyers _
to avoid any infringement problems with Sears.
   ``We talked to a couple of different attorneys who said, `It's a
different spelling ... shears are a tool of your trade, so you
shouldn't have any problem.'''
   But Smith said Sears isn't satisfied and by law must
aggressively pursue anyone who attempts to use a name similar to
Sears.
   ``The burden is on the companies to prove they are very
interested in their trademarks ... or they lose them,'' the Sears
spokesman said.
   Should the Roes not change the name, ``We will have to
vigorously pursue it,'' Smith said.
   Roe said he still hopes to retain the name.
   ``It's just a big guy picking on a little guy. No one thinks
we're associated with Sears. It's almost ridiculous,'' he said.

   The stock market retreated today, running into
resistance after Thursday's rise to a record high.
   Analysts said traders seemed reluctant to chase after the rally
that has carried stock prices sharply higher this month.
   Much of the impetus for that advance came from an abrupt
downturn in interest rates as fears of resurgent inflation eased.
   Now, brokers say, investors seem inclined to wait for evidence
that interest rates can go lower still.
   Rates rose in the credit markets today. Prices of long-term
government bonds dropped about $5 for each $1,000 in face value,

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed
moderately to sharply lower Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade as
speculators sold aggressively amid signs that near-term
availability of U.S. grains has improved.
   The decline erased most of the gains posted Thursday.
   Analysts also cited new private forecasts for several days of
dry weather in the Midwest early next week, which would allow
farmers to get back in their fields and resume planting of corn and
soybeans sooner than had been expected.
   Further selling in the futures market was prompted by
indications that Thursday's across-the-board rally prompted more
U.S. farmers to sell old-crop corn and soybeans, said William
Biedermann, research director with the commodities brokerage
Allendale Inc.
   Increased soybean shipments from South America to Europe also
weighed on soybean futures, he said.
   With supplies of corn and soybeans more readily available,
Biedermann said, commercial grain dealers ``are willing to buy on a
hand-to-mouth basis and are not aggresively supporting the market.''
   At the close, wheat futures were 2} cents to 5 cents lower with
the contract for delivery in May at $3.86 a bushel; corn was 2
cents to 4{ cents lower with May at $2.83} a bushel; oats were 5{
cents to 6{ cents lower with May at $1.49 a bushel; soybeans were 7
cents to 10{ cents lower with May at $6.09{ a bushel.

   Ford Motor Co. said Friday it would shut
down its Atlanta assembly plant next week, laying off about 2,500
hourly workers.
   The company said a shortage of dealer orders for the Ford Taurus

assembles about 5,000 of the cars at the plant every week.
   Ford also makes the Taurus and Sable at its Chicago assembly

   The dollar ended mostly higher Friday in light,
uneventful trading, while the spotlight in foreign exchange
remained on the British pound.
   Gold prices rose worldwide.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $374.70 a troy ounce, up $5.20 from late
Thursday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $373.25 an ounce, up $4.15.
   Currency dealers said the dollar benefitted partly from the
continued strength in the British pound, particularly in the
European market.
   With demand for the pound up, foreign traders sold their
currencies to buy sterling, and that made the dollar more valuable
against those currencies, explained Zlatko Glamuzina, chief dealer
at the New York office of Banco di Sicilia.
   The pound has been supported in recent days by speculation that
Britain was preparing to enter the European Monetary System. Some
traders acknowledged imminent entry was unlikely, but they said the
prospect of entry alone will provide underlying support for the
pound for several weeks.
   Trading was described as quiet in New York in the absence of any
new economic indicators or financial developments. Also, the
trading floors were quieter since some dealers already were en
route to next week's annual gathering of foreign exchange dealers
in Copenhagen, Denmark.
   Sterling rose to $1.6910 from $1.6905 Thursday in London, but it
eased slightly on profit-taking to $1.6900 from $1.6920 in New York.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's quotes, included: 1.6483 West German marks, down from
1.6498; 1.4050 Swiss francs, up from 1.4045; 5.5595 French francs,
up from 5.5570; 1,212.75 Italian lire, up from 1,212.50; and
1.17975 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17475.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Thursday
included: 1.6478 West German marks, up from 1.6474; 1.4045 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4049; 5.5555 French francs, up from 5.5510;
1.8550 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8430; 1212.00 Italian lire, up
from 1210.50; and 1.1782 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1738.
   In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the dollar closed
at 152.90 yen, up 0.90 yen from Thursday's 152.00-yen finish. It
traded at 152.80 yen in London, and at 153.00 yen in New York, up
from 152.15 yen.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $369.75 a troy ounce
from $369.25 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, gold rose to $370.60 an
ounce from $369. Thursday.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose 15 cents an ounce to close at $370.30.
   Silver prices also gained ground. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery settled at $5.122 a troy ounce, up
from $5.026 late Thursday. Silver rose in London to $5.06 an ounce
from $5.05.

<HEAD>Pan Am Puts Shuttle Up for Sale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pan Am Shuttle was put up for sale Friday as
money-losing Pan Am Corp. tries to raise money for the operation of
its biggest subsidiary, Pan American World Airways.
   Pan Am has previously indicated it was looking for partners
after coming off one of the worst years in its 62-year history.
   The decision puts both air shuttle services carrying passengers
along the heavily traveled Northeast Corridor between Boston, New
York and Washington, D.C., up for sale at the same time.
   Developer Donald Trump hired Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in April to
negotiate the possible sale of Trump Shuttle, which he acquired a
year ago for $365 million.
   One industry analyst, Kevin Murphy of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.,
estimated Pan Am may get $350 million for the Pan Am Shuttle, which
he said controls about 55 percent of the East Coast air shuttle
market.
   Possible suitors for the Pan Am Shuttle include the airlines
Delta, American, USAir and America West.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Pan Am closed
unchanged at $2.50 a share.
   Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett has repeatedly indicated he
wants to have Pan Am World Airways become part of a larger route
network either through merger, acquisition or a joint marketing
agreement.
   In a filing Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Pan Am said it had ``determined to pursue the possible sale of, or
other commercial transaction involving, the Pan Am Shuttle.''
   It said the transaction ``is being contemplated in order to
provide additional liquidity to support the operations'' of Pan Am
World Airways.
   The statement noted that this potential sale would be in
addition to the company's previously-disclosed plans to sell its
service within West Germany.
   Company spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said the Pan Am board would
produce additional capital that can be reinvested in Pan Am World
Airways. Among the company's goals has been to expand its
operations in Miami where traffic bound for points south of the
United States can counter seasonal declines in travel to Europe and
to attract more business travelers.
   The parent company has lost about $1 billion over the past
decade, has not made an annual profit since 1980 and lost $336
million in 1989 alone.
   That loss included $437.1 million loss at Pan Am World Airways
last year.
   The Pan Am Shuttle has been profitable since shortly after Pan
Am started it in October 1986 as a competitor to the
long-established Eastern Shuttle, company spokeswoman Hanlon said.
   Pan Am does not disclose financial results for the shuttle,
which operates separately from Pan Am World Airways.
   Ms. Hanlon noted, however, that Pan Am World Airways accounted
for $3.3 billion of the company's $3.6 billion in revenue in 1989.
   The remainder of the revenue came mainly from the shuttle and
Pan Am Express, which operates a regional system serving 32 cities
that feeds traffic into Pan Am's hub cities.
   Pan Am World Airways serves 99 cities overall, including 31 in
the United States, and carried 15 million passengers last year. Ms.
Hanlon said about 4 million people a year travel the two shuttles
on the Boston-New York-Washington route.
   The Pan Am shuttle operates at least 16 roundtrip flights a day
between New York and Boston and another 16 roundtrips between New
York and Washington.
   The service is popular particularly with business travelers who
are guaranteed a seat without making a reservation. When a plane is
full, the shuttle rolls out another plane to accommodate other
travelers.
   Pan Am started the shuttle after buying landing and takeoff
slots and gates from Texas Air Corp.'s New York Air service. It
captured about a quarter of the shuttle market in its first month
of operation and built slowly toward just under 50 percent.
   Its market share rose dramatically in the wake of a March 1989
strike against Eastern Airlines, but the Trump Shuttle has whittled
away at Pan Am's big lead in recent months.

<HEAD>Interco Has Bankruptcy Option Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interco Inc. is trying to come up with two
alternatives to extricate itself from its financial woes, but
analysts said Friday neither option is likely to win much support
from shareholders or the company's debtors.
   Interco said Thursday it would ask shareholders to approve a
pre-packaged bankruptcy reorganization plan that could be put into
effect if the company cannot win shareholder approval of a debt
restructuring.
   The St. Louis-based company, which is saddled with a heavy debt
load after a $2.8 billion recapitalization, has been trying to
restructure its indebtedness outside of bankruptcy court.
   But analysts said the restructuring has little chance of being
accepted.
   ``This is part of the negotiating drill,'' said King
Bartholomew, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York. ``It has
a low probability of being successful.''
   Said Juli Niemann, an analyst for Stifel Nicolaus &amp; Co. in St.
Louis, ``At this point I'd be surprised if bondholders will be part
of the get-along gang.''
   ``I think going to be very confrontational,'' she said.
   Interco said that if neither the restructuring nor the Chapter
11 plan is approved, it might be forced to file for bankruptcy
court protection from its creditors without an approved plan.
   The outcome of such a filing, according to documents filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, would be uncertain. Interco
said common stockholders could stand to lose their investment if
the company goes into bankruptcy without a pre-packaged plan.
   Interco ran into trouble after it recapitalized to fend off a
hostile takeover attempt in 1988. The company borrowed money to pay
shareholders cash dividends totaling $1.42 billion, a package of
junk bonds and preferred stock and stock in a stub company.
   The company sold off some of its divisions, including its Ethan
Allen furniture business and Londontown rainwear manufacturer, but
it has been unable to sell all the assets it needed at high enough
prices to help fund the recapitalization.
   The surviving company consists of Florsheim Shoe Co., Converse
Inc., Broyhill Furniture Co. and Lane Co.
   Interco said the restructuring it is now proposing will allow
management to concentrate on its core businesses instead of its
debt load.
   Last week bond analysts said they were dissatisfied with the
proposed plan, viewing it as the company's opening offer. In order
for Interco to proceed with the plan, it must win the approval of
90 percent of the holders of each class of common and preferred
stock and each class of its bonds.
   The pre-packaged bankruptcy it is offering as a fallback
position requires the approval of a simple majority of shareholders
in each class. But that majority must control at least two-thirds
of the stock or bonds in their respective class.
   In its proposed restructuring, Interco is asking holders of its
debt to convert the majority of their bonds to common stock and
then to participate in a 10-for-one reverse stock split.
   That split would reduce the equity of common shareholders to 10
percent of their current holdings.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Give More Ground</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices lost more ground Friday in light
dealings as the Federal Reserve took steps that signaled to many
traders that it has no intention of relaxing its monetary policy
anytime soon.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell { point, or $5 per
$1,000 face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, rose
to 8.69 percent from 8.64 percent late Thursday and 8.66 percent
last Friday.
   The market traded in a narrow range this week in the wake of a
powerful rally that had knocked long-term Treasury yields down from
more than 9 percent at the beginning of the month.
   Analysts said Friday's decline stemmed from the Federal
Reserve's second consecutive daily move to arrange short-term sales
of Treasury securities with the understanding that it would
repurchase them in a day or so.
   That action temporarily drains funds from the banking system,
and puts upward pressure on interest rates.
   ``It was seen as an even stronger indication they weren't about
to ease policy,'' said Robert Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds
Bank in New York.
   Some traders had hoped for an easing of credit policy in view of
recent reports that have indicated economic growth and inflation
are moderating.
   Analysts said Friday's decline also reflected some
disappointment that budget talks between President Bush and
congressional negotiators have failed to yield more results.
   ``It just doesn't seem there is a heck of a lot of progress
being made,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., who follows the credit
markets for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Failure to reach an agreement could mean that the government
would be forced to borrow more than expected, flooding the market
with more securities and possibly driving the general level of
interest rates higher.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments lost 5-32 point, intermediate maturities dropped \
point and long-term issues fell as much as 9-16 point, according to
Telerate Inc., the financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 2.74 to 1,144.97.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 3-16 point to 91 1-32. The average
yield to maturity rose to 7.56 percent from 7.55 percent late
Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.99 percent as the
discount rose 6 basis points to 7.74 percent. Yields on six-month
bills rose to 8.14 percent as the discount rose 4 basis points to
7.73 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.27 percent as the
discount rose 5 basis points to 7.70 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8 3-16 percent, unchanged
from late Thursday.

   Energy futures prices gave up their gains and
closed mostly lower Friday as investors, led by gasoline traders,
decided to take profits before the weekend.
   The June contract for delivery of unleaded regular gasoline rose
0.22 cent to close at 64.43 cents a gallon on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, but that was down from a session high of 65.35
cents. The July contract managed a slight gain, but subsequent
months closed lower.
   The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, slipped 11 cents $18.76 a 42-gallon barrel.
   Home heating oil for June delivery fell 0.04 cent to 51.92 cents
a gallon.
   Analysts said the market had traded higher but when
profit-taking began in gasoline futures, oil prices also dropped.
   Andrew Lebow, an analyst at E.D.&amp;F. Man International Inc., said
gasoline broke through the 64.50-cents-a-gallon level and still
attracted buyers. But in the last 15 minutes of trading, the market
turned around.
   There were no news developments to affect trading, he said.
   In the natural gas market, the June contract declined to $1.554
per 1,000 cubic feet from $1.570 on Thursday.

<HEAD>Banks Say They Have Tightened Credit Standards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of large banks surveyed in May
reported they had tightened their standards for loans to small and
medium-sized businesses in the first four months of this year, the
Federal Reserve said Friday.
   More than half of 60 large banks surveyed nationally said they
had made credit policies more stringent, with one in 10 reporting
they had tightened considerably, the regulatory agency said.
   Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Small Business
Committee, said the survey was the first hard evidence backing up
complaints of a credit crunch from small business owners.
   He summoned regulators from the central bank, the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency to a June 6 hearing ``to start exploring the extent of the
problem and its ramifications.''
   Regulators had told LaFalce's panel April 25 they were unable to
confirm that a lending squeeze had spread beyond the real estate
industry. However, business owners, particularly from New England,
said long-established sources of credit were drying up.
   ``The survey indicates that the anecdotal information we were
given at our hearing has a real basis in fact,'' LaFalce said.
   As recently as last week, after a meeting between the three top
federal banking regulators and the nation's largest bank trade
association, Greenspan had said evidence of the credit crunch was
``quite limited.''
   But, seeking to prevent the squeeze from snowballing, Greenspan
stressed in private remarks to officials of the American Bankers
Association that bankers should continue to make sound loans.
   In Friday's survey, lending officers said the primary reason for
tightening lending policy was ``a less favorable economic
outlook.'' Second, was a deterioration in the performance of loans
the bank had made previously. Pressure from regulators was also
mentioned frequently.
   In addition to tightening standards for which loan applicants
qualify, more than half the banks reported making the terms of
loans they did make to medium-sized businesses more stringent,
including requiring more collateral.
   About 30 percent said they had reduced the size of credit lines
to middle-market firms. Also, on balance, banks reported a slightly
wider spread between the interest rate they were charging
businesses for loans and the banks own cost of funds.
   The 60 banks surveyed hold slightly less than a third of
commercial banking's $2.9 trillion in assets.

<HEAD>Dodge Viper Will Cost Under $50,000, But How Much Under?
^LaserPhoto, Graphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp.'s new muscle car, the Dodge
Viper, will debut during the 1992 model year at a sticker price of
``under $50,000,'' chairman Lee Iacocca said Friday.
   Iacocca made the anticipated announcement at a news conference
that capped a six-city tour promoting the quality of Chrysler
vehicles.
   The Viper was both seen and heard at the news conference with
Iacocca introducing it amid an ear-deafening roar from its
400-horsepower engine as a model of the car emerged from behind a
curtain into a spotlight.
   The car had been unveiled at a Detroit auto show last year, but
Friday's announcement was the first official confirmation that it
would go into production.
   Iacocca said about 200 of the two-seaters will be produced in
time for sale late next year. While the chairman said the car would
sell for under $50,000, he wouldn't say how much under.
   Chrysler is counting on the sexy new car to jazz up its flagging
image and sales.
   Iacocca said the car, powered by a V-10 engine originally
designed for trucks, will go from 0 to 60 mph in 3.9 seconds. Its
top speed will be 188 mph.
   Chrysler officials said they eventually expect to produce about
5,000 Vipers a year, to be sold at 300 to 500 U.S. dealerships.
   Iacocca said developing the Viper cost Chrysler ``tens and tens
of millions _ not hundreds of millions,'' adding it can make money
for the company at a sales pace of 5,000 cars a year.
   Features on the sleek competitor to Chevrolet's Corvette include
an integrated roll bar and exhaust pipes built into a cutaway side.
   Among the team members who came up with the Viper concept was
Chrysler consultant Carroll Shelby, the father of the popular
Shelby Cobras.
   Iacocca told reporters at the downtown Bonaventure Hotel news
conference that it was Shelby who edged him out of getting the
first Cobra produced in the 1960s.
   Shelby has been offered millions of dollars for that car,
Iacocca noted ruefully.
   ``I am not making the same mistake twice,'' he said pointing to
a red Viper on display. ``This one here is mine.''
   Chrysler says the Viper is the first vehicle produced by a
computer-driven ``conceptual design and rendering system,'' which
is supposed to cut by 25 percent the time it takes to bring a
totally new car to market.
   The car has been one of the company's worst-kept secrets. The
prototype drew huge crowds at last year's auto show, and word of
the car's production schedule leaked out earlier this week.
   Iacocca also hinted Friday that he may stick around after his
contract with the No. 3 automaker expires at the end of 1991. He'd
been noncommittal about the issue during Chrysler's annual meeting
Thursday in Universal City.
   At the news conference, he gestured toward a bank of sporty red
cars, displayed as testimony that not all Chrysler products are
stodgy: the Viper, a new Lamborghini Diablo, a Plymouth Laser, a Le
Baron convertible, a Dodge Stealth, a Dodge Shadow convertible.
   ``If this stuff starts to sell, I might want to stick around for
a while,'' he said.
   He also said he believed that slipping sales of Chrysler cars
and trucks had bottomed out, thanks in part to the recent ad
campaign, which strives to compare Chrysler vehicles favorably to
Japanese cars.
   Even before the official announcement Friday, pleas for the
Viper were flooding the automaker from 3,300 people who wrote,
called or ``sent money,'' Iacocca said.
   ``Not everyone who wants one is going to get one unless he's
willing to stand in line for a while'' because of the limited
production, he said.

<HEAD>Fed Concluded At March Meeting That Inflation A Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve policy-makers concluded at
their March meeting that excessive inflation would continue and
decided to maintain high interest rate policies in the face of a
moderately growing economy, according to minutes of the meeting
released Friday.
   The minutes were made available amid signs that the
policy-makers, who met in secret again Tuesday, decided at the
latest meeting to continue the policies at least for the next six
weeks while they try to determine the economy's direction.
   The Fed has tried for more than two years to stem inflation by
keeping a tight grip on credit and thus slowing the economy. Some
observers fear the tight-money policies could restrain the economy
too much and push it into a recession.
   But at its March 27 meeting, the central bank's Federal Open
Market Committee reviewed information that ``suggested that the
economy was likely to expand at a somewhat faster pace over the
next several quarters than in the fourth quarter of 1989,'' the
minutes said.
   At the same time, a staff projection said ``little improvement
was anticipated in the underlying trend of inflation,'' and some
members commented that ``the prospects for inflation remained the
most disturbing aspect of the economic outlook.''
   ``On balance,'' the minutes said, ``little or no progress in
reducing inflation appeared to be in prospect for the quarters
immediately ahead.''
   As a result, most members indicated a preference for an
unchanged policy, although several preferred an immediate move
toward a tighter stance to achieve price stability. The vote for
maintaining policy was 9-2.
   Until several weeks ago, many analysts thought the Fed might
tighten credit at its meeting this week. However, statistics for
employment, industrial production, retail sales and inflation all
pointed to a return to slower growth in April.
   In fact, some traders thought the central bank had loosened
credit to stimulate growth when the federal funds rate dropped
below the Fed's 8.25 percent target late Wednesday and early
Thursday.
   But the Fed took steps Thursday to push up the rate, which is
what banks charge each other for overnight loans. That signaled to
many market watchers that a relaxation of monetary policy was not
imminent.
   The federal funds rate is the primary lever the Fed uses to
control short-term interest rates.
   Edward G. Boehne, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in
Philadelphia and a member of the FOMC, also told a bankers group
Thursday that Fed policy has been unchanged since December.
   The federal funds rate has remained at 8.25 percent since Dec.
21, when the central bank permitted it to drop from 8.50 percent.
That move followed its Dec. 18-19 meeting.
   The FOMC, comprised of the seven Fed governors and five of the
presidents of the 12 Fed regional banks, meets in secret eight
times a year to formulate monetary policy and confers by telephone
as needed. Minutes of the meeting are released about six weeks
later.

<HEAD>Supply Fears Push Platinum Futures Above $500</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum futures prices rocketed above $500 an ounce Friday for
the first time in two months amid supply fears sparked by South
African racial violence and a reported drop in platinum sales by
the Soviet Union.
   On other commodity markets, other precious metals also rose
sharply; cocoa futures surged to new 14-month highs; livestock and
meat futures rose; grains and soybeans fell; and oil futures were
mixed.
   Platinum futures settled $14.10 to $15.10 higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange with the contract for delivery in July at $507
a troy ounce, the highest settlement of a near-month platinum
contract since March 15.
   The rally was underpinned by the threat of supply disruptions
from South Africa, the world's largest platinum producer, if racial
violence there continues, several analysts said.
   Two people died in a fight between black and white workers at a
South African gold mine Wednesday, which kicked off a series of
incidents in the country in which 12 more people were killed.
   ``There is a perception that the middle ground in South Africa
may be getting smaller and smaller, creating a situation where
there is more opportunity for the left and the right to clash,''
said William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc.
   Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with PaineWebber Inc.,
traced some of the strength to an annual platinum supply-and-demand
report issued earlier this week by British platinum refiner Johnson
Matthey PLC.
   In the report, Johnson Matthey said sales of physical platinum
by the Soviet Union reached a decade-high 550,000 ounces in 1989
but were expected to decline in 1990 to levels nearer 1988's sales
of 440,000 ounces.
   The unusually high level of sales last year suggests the Soviets
dipped into their platinum stockpile and ``indicates they may not
have much platinum left,'' Savaiko said.
   He and O'Neill said that with this week's gains, the platinum
market appeared to be on a bullish course. But Merrill Lynch
analyst David Syphen said the rally was merely a correction from an
oversold condition.
   Gold futures settled $5 to $5.60 higher on New York's Commodity
Exchange with June at $375.60 a troy ounce; silver was 9.5 cent to
9.6 cents higher with May at $5.122 a troy ounce.
   Cocoa futures rose sharply on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa
Exchange on reports of that soldiers in the Ivory Coast continued
to demand better wages and living conditions. The Ivory Coast is
the world's biggest cocoa producer.
   Cocoa settled $28 to $31 higher with July at $1,477 per ton, the
highest near-month cocoa settlement since March 15, 1989.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures were
supported by a government report that showed a fewer number of
cattle placed on feedlots last month than the market had expected.
   Pork futures were boosted by firm cash markets and bullish chart
signals.
   Live cattle futures settled .05 cent to .50 cent higher with
June at 74.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .35 cent to .77
cent higher with May at 85.52 cents a pound; live hogs were .10
cent to .72 cent higher with June at 66.82 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .15 cent lower to 2 cents higher with May at
68.22 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures ended moderately to sharply lower on
the Chicago Board of Trade as speculators sold aggressively amid
signs of improved near-term availability of corn and soybeans.
   Wheat futures settled 2} cents to 4{ cents lower with May at
$3.85} a bushel; corn was 2{ cents to 4\ cents lower with May at
$2.83} a bushel; oats were 5{ cents to 7\ cents lower with May at
$1.49 a bushel; soybeans were 7 cents to 10\ cents lower with May
at $6.09{ a bushel.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude oil settled 11 cents to 12 cents lower with June at $18.76 a
barrel; heating oil was .04 cent to .24 cent lower with June at
51.92 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .13 cent lower to .22
cent higher with June at 64.43 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Describe Commodities Trades With Tapes, Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE SCOBEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors Friday began the painstaking
task of trying to recreate allegedly fraudulent commodities trades
with tape recordings, documents and the testimony of an undercover
FBI agent.
   Jurors donned headsets with big yellow foam-rubber earpads to
listen to snippets of tape recordings made by FBI agent Randall
Jannett amid the din of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange trading
floor.
   Prosecutors contend the tapes document fraudulent trades made by
the three defendants. It is the first trial stemming from an FBI
sting operation at the world's two largest commodities exchanges.
   Jannett testified that he made a $100 profit in a trade made off
the market, or outside the open auction in the trading pit. The
practice is deemed illegal because it deprives the customer of the
most competitive price.
   Jannett said he bought Swiss franc futures contracts from
defendant Robert D. Mosky at a price below the market price. The
government contends the two men made the trade between themselves
rather than in the auction.
   Defendants Mosky, Danny L. Scheck and David Zatz were indicted
last year, along with 44 other Chicago futures traders and a clerk,
on charges of defrauding customers who sent in orders to the floors
of the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade. Sixteen have pleaded
guilty.
   The tapes _ which also were played over loudspeakers in the
courtroom _ were noisy, and the most clearly audible words were
shouted numbers. In one tape, two voices were conversing, but the
conversation was difficult to make out.
   ``You have to get an ear for it,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney James
Fleissner told a reporter during a recess in the trial, which began
May 8.
   Jurors were given transcripts of the taped conversations but
U.S. District Judge Ann C. Williams repeatedly reminded them that
the tapes, not the transcripts, were the evidence.
   ``You're to rely on what the tape says and not the transcript,''
she said.
   On the witness stand was Jannett, who posed as a corrupt trader
at the Merc from February through December 1988.
   During questioning by Fleissner, Jannett described a trade in
which he said Mosky sold him nine Swiss franc futures contracts
below the market price.
   One contract represents 125,000 francs. The price of the
contract changes in units, or ``ticks,'' of .01 cent per franc.
   Jannett testified that the market price for Swiss franc
contracts was 71.62 cents per franc but that Mosky said to him,
``Sold you nine at one,'' meaning 71.61 cents.
   Jannett said he had not agreed to buy the nine contracts.
   Jannett testified that he then sold eight contracts at the
market price of 71.62 cents to another trader.
   ``How did that leave you?'' Fleissner asked.
   ``I had made eight ticks, or $100,'' Jannett said.
   Jannett then testified that Mosky said to him, ``Good things
happen to those who help out.''
   Attorneys for the three defendants have argued that their
clients did nothing wrong and that Jannett was so befuddled in the
melee of the trading pit that he mistook legitimate
trade-confirmation conversations for attempts to defraud customers.
   Mosky, Scheck and Zatz face more than a dozen counts each of
mail or wire fraud and violations of the Commodity Exchange Act.
Mosky also is charged with racketeering conspiracy, for which he
could be sent to prison for 20 years and be forced to forfeit
personal assets, including exchange membership.

   Toyota Motor Corp. will produce commercial vehicles
in Colombia in a joint venture with a subsidiary of France's
Renault and Mitsui and Co., a major Japanese trading company,
officials said.
   Japan's largest automaker said Friday it has signed an agreement
with Sociedad de Fabrication de Automotores Renault S.A. and Mitsui
and has obtained Colombian authorization for the project.
   Under the agreement, Sofasa-Renault will add Toyota's Land
Cruiser and Hilux models to the line of Renault cars it produces in
Colombia.
   Land Cruiser production is scheduled to begin in October 1991
with an annual output of 4,000 cars. Hilux production is to start
in April 1992 with a target of 3,000 vehicles, Toyota said in a
news release.
   The two models will be marketed through a new Toyota dealership
network that Sofasa-Renault will set up.
   Hiroshi Hashimoto, a spokesman for Toyota, said the company will
make an effort to meet a Colombian government's desire to export
commercial vehicles produced in the country.
   Toyota and Mitsui also will acquire stakes in Sofasa-Renault,
with Toyota investing $10.5 million for a 17.5 percent stake and
Mitsui $4.5 million for 7.5 percent, the release said. Renault owns
74.7 percent of Sofasa-Renault, which produced about 11,000 cars
last year.

<HEAD>Southwest Savings, Created by Regulators, Taken Over By Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Southwest Savings Association, the third-largest
thrift in Texas and one of the institutions created by the
controversial federal Southwest Plan, was taken over by government
regulators Friday.
   The $5.5 billion asset thrift, owned by the Caroline Hunt Trust
Estate, is the first of the Southwest Plan institutions to fail.
The thrift was created by regulators from four insolvent thrifts on
May 18, 1988.
   The estate of Caroline Hunt, daughter of the late wildcat oilman
H.L. Hunt, contributed $25 million in equity to the new savings and
loan in return for $2 billion in notes, yield maintenance and
capital coverage.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision placed the Dallas-based
institution under control of the Resolution Trust Corp. The
agencies were created last year to clean up the faltering thrift
industry.
   The OTS said Southwest Savings was operating in an ``unsafe and
unsound condition and had incurred losses that depleted
substantially all of its capital, with no prospect of replenishment
without federal assistance.''
   M. Danny Wall, the former head of the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp. who advocated the Southwest Plan, said Southwest
Savings' failure was not an indication of problems in the 14 other
Southwest Plan deals.
   ``This is an exception from the standpoint of the deals that
were done,'' Wall said by telephone from his home near Washington,
D.C. ``It was early in the process and as more time went on there
and elsewhere, we discovered the problems were greater in
institutions in Texas and elsewhere than we thought.
   ``Clearly our view at the time we made the decision was that
there were deep pockets at the parent, and the deep pockets would
protect their investment,'' Wall said. ``They apparently have
chosen not to.''
   The Hunt estate's office was closed and no one could be reach
for comment Friday night.
   ``The observation needs to be made that Southwest Savings itself
needed help fairly soon after the deal was made,'' said Wall, who
was forced out as head of the OTS in part because of congressional
displeasure with the Southwest Plan deals.
   Under the Southwest Plan, regulators led by Wall sought to bail
out failing institutions by bringing in new investors and promising
future assistance in return for the investment. The deals were
defended as the best solution at the time because of the insolvency
of the insurance fund.
   The deals have been attacked as too costly, with the General
Accounting Office suggesting it would have been cheaper to shut
down a third of the institutions and pay off depositors.
   Separately, the Resolution Trust Corp. said Friday it was
spending an estimated $188 million in federal assistance to aid the
sale of the insolvent Broadview Federal Savings Bank in Cleveland,
Ohio, to First Federal Savings Bank in Cleveland.
   First Federal will assume responsibility for all of Broadview's
108,000 deposit accounts and other liabilities, totaling about $1.4
billion. First Federal paid a premium of $11.95 million for the
deposits and agreed to purchase $930 million of the failed
institution's assets, with the right to return any to the
government within three months.
   The RTC is injecting $483 million into Broadview, but it hopes
to recover a substantial portion of that by retaining and selling
about $421 million of the closed institution's assets.
   In Boston, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said it closed
MerchantsBank and transferred its $340 million in deposits to the
First National Bank of Boston, the principal subsidiary of Bank of
Boston.
   It was the first bank failure in Massachusetts.
   An FDIC statement said its board of directors declared
MerchantsBank insolvent and placed it under FDIC receivership
because no acceptable purchase and assumption bids were received
for the ailing co-operative bank.
   Deposits in the failed bank will become deposits in Bank of
Boston, which will reopen all eight MerchantsBank branch offices
Monday.
   Also Friday, the OTS placed First Savings and Loan Association
of Borger, Texas, in conservatorship and sold Houston's Cornerstone
Federal Savings Association to Great Southwest Savings, also in
Houston.

   The stock market settled for a mixed showing Friday, running
into resistance after Thursday's rise to a record high. The Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 11.80 to 2,819.91, reducing
its weekly gain to 18.33.
   Bond prices also fell on fear that the Federal Resere won't ease
interest rates.
   The dollar rose against most key currencies.
   Precious metals advanced sharply on fears of supply disruptions
caused by South African unrest; cocoa futures surged to new
14-month highs; livestock and meat futures rose; grains and

   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
Richard Breeden renewed his turf war Friday with the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, saying the SEC should be given power to
regulate stock index futures.
   Speculators who believe strongly that the stock market as a
whole is going to rise or fall can bet on the movement of Standard
&amp; Poor's index of 500 stocks without worrying about picking
individual stocks.
   Even though the index comprises stocks, the CFTC regulates the
sale of futures contracts based on the index, as it does futures in
commodities such as soybeans or pork bellies. In a speech Friday to
the Los Angeles World Affairs Council, Breeden said there's no
reason for that.
   While stocks must be purchased with no more than 50 percent
borrowed funds, margin requirements mean stock index futures can be
purchased with 97 percent borrowed money _ far too much, Breeden
said.
   Beyond that, U.S. brokerages who want to offer stocks, bonds and
stock index futures must pay to maintain two separate regulatory
agencies and their separate sets of rules, he said.
   ``Nomura and Daiwa do not have to do that in Tokyo. Morgan
Grenfell and S.G. Warburg don't have to do it in London. Thus, we
alone suffer from a fragmented system that reduces effectiveness
and raises costs _ just the opposite of what should occur,''
Breeden said.
   Meeting with reporters here Thursday, Breeden said the
settlement under which Michael Milken will provide information to
the SEC after he is sentenced will help the SEC's investigations of
Irvine-based Lincoln Savings and Miami-based Centrust Bank.
   Both thrifts were heavy investors in the junk bonds Milken
pioneered, and their failures will cost taxpayers billions of
dollars.
   Breeden said he expects more indictments in the insider trading
probe that has led to the convictions of Milken, Ivan Boesky and
Dennis Levine.
   ``We think the Milken settlement was a good one,'' he said.
   In his speech Friday, Breeden renewed calls for more cooperation
between securities regulators in countries around the world, and
for the dismantling of the checkerboard of different regulations in
the 50 U.S. states.
   With European economic barriers coming down in 1992, it is
conceivable that it may someday be easier for someone to sell a
stock issue in every country in Europe than in every U.S. state, he
said.
   Breeden also called for legislation to reduce the amount of
federally insured deposits.
   Breeden, who advised President Bush on the savings and loan
bailout legislation last year before becoming head of the SEC, said
the bailout's requirements that thrifts put more of their own cash
at risk was a ``serious step in returning sanity to our regulation
of depository institutions.''
   However, he said, ``We need to follow this legislation with a
plan to significantly reduce the aggregate volume of federally
insured deposits, as deposit insurance provided the fuel for the
fire in the thrift disaster and could do so again.''
