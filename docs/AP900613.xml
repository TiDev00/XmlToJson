   Steven A. Martindale, Washington lawyer and
lobbyist known for the parties he threw, died Wednesday at George
Washington University Hospital.
   Martindale, 46, had AIDS and had been writing an article on his
struggle with the disease for Washingtonian magazine, which will
publish it in a forthcoming issue.
   A native of Pocatello, Idaho, Martindale served on the staff of
then-Sen. Charles Goodell, R-N.Y. and turned to public relations
when Goodell left the Senate in 1971. Recently he had been
associated with Saudi billionaire Adnan Kashoggi and wrote a book
about him published last year in Britain under the title ``By Hook
or By Crook.''
   He was the subject of a Washington Post profile in 1974
describing how his parties gained him entree into the circles of
the powerful. In a 1987 article in the newspaper he was asked why
the powerful Washington party hostesses _ he was a rare host in the
calling _ had disappeared. His answer, in part: ``The press scared
everybody off.''
   He is survived by his parents and a brother.

   Defeated Southern Baptist moderates on
Wednesday weighed an uncertain, perhaps separate future from their
fundamentalist-dominated convention as it undercut a
religious-liberty agency in the nation's capital.
   Unless the denomination's ruling bloc becomes more inclusive and
``accepts the rest of us brothers and sisters,'' some are going to
leave, said the Rev. Daniel Vestal, defeated moderate candidate for
the denomination's presidency.
   Similar break-away sentiments came from others in that camp,
which charges fundamentalists with using their appointive powers to
control agencies and institutions of the 14.9-million-member
denomination.
   The Rev. Morris Chapman, whose election as president Tuesday
extended fundamentalist control for a 12th straight year, has
supported moving the staff of the country's largest Protestant body
toward a unanimous belief that the Bible is error-free.
   The convention Wednesday slashed support of the Washington-based
Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs, the influential
religious liberty lobby of nine Baptist groups for 50 years.
   Fundamentalists have assailed it for opposing prayer sponsored
by public schools and for not fighting abortion.
   The convention cut 87 percent of its support to the agency by
shifting $346,796 to the $1.3 million budget of the Christian Life
Commission. In so doing, it gave the job of lobbying for religious
freedom to an agency whose primary mission is upholding morality.
   With that change, ``they'll laugh us off Capitol Hill,'' said
the Rev. Ron Sisk of Tiburon, Calif.
   The convention also gave some of the religious liberty function
to the Public Affairs Committee, creating three, perhaps
conflicting, voices.
   The Rev. James Dunn, head of the Baptist Joint Committee, said
it would keep up its defense of church-state separation and against
``government intrusion into religion.''
   ``We won't downgade our religious-liberty agenda,'' he said,
noting that assurances of supplemental financing were coming from
state and local Southern Baptist churches across the country.
   He told reporters that with the multiple agencies, there likely
will be ``contradictory testimony at times. It's something we'll
have to live with.''
   The Rev. Richard Land, head of the Christian Life Commission,
said his agency shares the joint committee's stand on church-state
separation and many other issues. Land predicted that ``conflicts
will be far fewer than sometimes has been supposed.''
   But he added that ``there are many places where
misinterpretation'' of Supreme Court decisions against sponsored
school prayers have produced a ``brooding hostility'' to religion.
   He said the ``greatest threat to religious liberty in the last
decade of this century comes not from violation'' of the
Constitution's ban against establishing religion but from violating
the reglious free-exercise guarantee.
   He charged there were ``infringements and restraints on people's
religious conscience.'
   The Rev. Grady Cothen of Coral Springs, Fla., head of of a newly
formed Religious Liberty Council to back the denominationally
downgraded joint agency, said the convention had ``turned a very
sharp corner to the right.''
   ``It implies that the powers-that-be do not want to bring along
the rest of us Christian brethren. They obviously want to be free
of us, but they won't make it.''
   However, Cothen, former president of the denomination's Sunday
School Board, added in an interview: ``Some will pull out. It's
inevitable.''
   Vestal, trounced in an election in which Chapman took 58 percent
of the ballots by more than 38,000 ``messengers,'' said moderates
soon would convene a meeting to consider their future.
   ``Let me confess some mystery about that future,'' he told
reporters. ``It's premature to talk about separation.'' But he said
there would be departures unless the current regime broadens its
inclusiveness.
   ``A lot of people are now ready to do something tangible to
express their dicontent and alienation,'' said the Rev. Stan Hastey
of Washington, executive director of the Baptist Alliance. They
group was formed to pursue alternatives to the current
denominational administration.
   He said several moderate groups, including the alliance, Baptist
Committed to the Southern Baptist Convention, and Women in
Ministries, would participate in the meeting about future steps,
probably in August.

   A pottery bowl painted with a
23-pointed star shows that an exploding star witnessed by ancient
Asians and Arabs was also seen by prehistoric Indians in the
Southwest, scientists said Tuesday.
   ``The bowl provides us with the best supported historic record
from the Western Hemisphere of the supernova that created the Crab
Nebula,'' said R. Robert Robbins, an astronomy professor at the
University of Texas at Austin.
   ``In fact, the bowl is the most certain record of the supernova
that has ever been discovered outside China and Japan,'' he said
during the 176th meeting of the American Astronomical Society.
   The white earthenware, Mimbres Indian bowl _ made between 1000
and 1150 A.D. and found in what is now southwestern New Mexico _
also shows the black-painted figure of a rabbit curled into a
crescent shape to symbolize the moon, Robbins said.
   In many Indian cultures in the New World, the rabbit commonly
represents the moon because Indians tended to see a rabbit in the
moon rather than a man in the moon, he said.
   Chinese astronomers recorded the appearance of the Crab Nebula
supernova in 1054 in the constellation Taurus. Their records showed
the star was so bright it could be seen in the daytime for 23 days.
   The supernova also was recorded by the Japanese, Robbins said.
   Steve Maran, senior staff scientist at the Goddard Space Flight
Center at Greenbelt, Md., said the supernova also was noticed in
Baghdad, where it was recorded in an 11th century medical
publication.
   The Mimbres bowl is decorated with a small black-painted
sunburst with 23 rays at one of the rabbit's rear feet. The 23 rays
represent the 23 days the supernova was clearly visible during the
day, Robbins said.
   The Crab Nebula is a huge cloud of gas in space that is the
remnant of the supernova. Supernovas are dying stars that blow up
and eject matter in all directions.
   The Crab Nebula is about 6 light years wide and about 6,500
light years from Earth. One light year equals almost 6 trillion
miles, which is the distance light travels in one year.
   American astronomers discovered early in this century that the
Crab Nebula is expanding at a rate implying an explosion beginning
about 900 years ago when first seen from Earth.
   A computer analysis shows the position of the sunburst and the
rabbit generally coincides with the location of the supernova and
the crescent moon on the morning of July 5, 1054, Robbins said.
   ``It shows us how sophisticated these people were,'' said
Robbins, who worked with photo technician Russell Westmoreland of
the University of Texas at Austin's astronomy department.
   The Mimbres lived in small farming villages. The bowl was from a
village called Galaz, and was found in the 1930s by scientists from
the University of Minnesota, Robbins said

   At least 3 million gallons of oil
spilled into the Gulf of Mexico from the Mega Borg, officials said
Wednesday, and the captain said the explosions that ripped through
the supertanker came without warning.
   ``I was in the radio room, alone, and suddenly the door swung
open, the lights went out, and glass was crashing down,'' said
Capt. C.M. Mahidhara told a panel questioning the Norwegian
vessel's crew.
   Fires sparked by the blasts Friday were under control but
continued to burn Wednesday. Crews have found a hole in the center
tank of the 886-foot ship, said Coast Guard Capt. Thomas Greene.
   ``A minimum of 3 million gallons has left the cargo tanks and
I'm presuming that most of that has gone into the water,'' Greene
said. ``I don't see any risk of losing cargo from the other tanks.''
   Most of the spilled light crude oil has burned or evaporated,
authorities said. Greene said between 12,000 gallons and 40,000
gallons remained in the water.
   The Coast Guard had initially estimated that up to 100,000
gallons of the ship's 38 million gallon cargo had leaked.
   The Norwegian government convened a board of inquiry Wednesday
at a Galveston hotel to question the crew. The captain said he
noticed nothing wrong before the explosions, which occurred around
11:30 p.m. Friday as oil was being transferred to a smaller tanker
57 miles southeast of Galveston.
   ``As far as I could see, everything was in good order,'' said
Mahidhara, a sailor for 17 years and a captain for nine.
   The crew is being questioned by Erik Leikvang, general consul of
Norway, and Ole Leithe, a Norwegian maritime investigator. They are
trying to determine the ship's seaworthiness and whether there is
any criminal liability stemming from the explosions and leak. The
Coast Guard also is participating in the hearing.
   Mahidhara said the crew went over a safety checklist before
transferring the fuel and all checks were satisfactory.
   Mahidhara said after the explosion, choking black smoke kept him
from locating and commanding his 41-member crew. Two men were
killed and two others are missing and presumed dead. Seventeen
crewmen were injured.
   Mahidhara and five other crewmen stayed aboard the burning
tanker to search for four missing men.
   The remains of the ship's chief officer, Tojo Sagar, were found
outside the pump room, he said. The body of crewman Bernardo Cortez
had been crushed by a falling skylight and also was found outside
the pump room, he said.
   Mahidhara, a seaman for 17 years and a captain for nine, said he
considered trying to launch a rescue effort for two men seen in the
engine room, but decided against it because of the smoke and fire.
   ``I did not think it was wise to send people down there. It was
too dangerous. I would have lost more people,'' he said.
   ``I looked forward and saw bright flames were coming from the
pump room and ventilators,'' he said. ``The flames were licking up
right over the bridge. The top of the pump room had been completely
blown off.''
   Leikvang said the hearing was only for fact-finding.
   ``I don't think we can find the reason for the explosion from
this hearing,'' said Leithe. ``Maybe later, when the ship is empty
and cleaned, we will know more.''
   An oil sheen streched 12 miles from the tanker on Wednesday,
said Greene. The oil had begun forming tar balls, and Greene said
he could not determine where the balls might wash ashore or how
soon.
   Salvage boats and Coast Guard ships were skimming the water and
using containment booms to try to corral the slick. The Coast Guard
said winds picked up on the gulf, hampering the booms' work, but
that the choppier waters would help chemical dispersants sprayed
over the spill.
   Six fireboats aimed a dozen streams of water on the rear of the
ship, leaving it shrouded in a cloud of steam and gray smoke.
   In the afternoon crews tried using flame-dousing foam on fire
pockets in the engine room but, as had been feared, the fire flared
up again and they returned to using water, said Coast Guard Chief
Petty Officer Todd Nelson.
   ``The reflash is a minor setback,'' Nelson said. ``There is very
little fire left on the ship.''
   Meanwhile, the Coast Guard said the Texas Land and Water
commissions can test a process that uses bacteria to ``eat'' oil on
the Mega Borg spill, provided the federal Environmental Protection
Agency approves a plan to be submitted Thursday.
   The rear of the Mega Borg has dropped more than 60 feet since
the tanker caught fire, and waves were washing over the deck.
   An 825-foot British-registered tanker, the Vic Bilh, was
standing by to transfer the remainder of the Mega Borg's cargo. But
Coast Guard officials have said that operation could be dangerous
because the ship was listing slightly and crews might have to pump
water into the holds to keep the vessel balanced.
   The Mega Borg, operated by Mosvolds Shipping of Farsund, Norway,
was bound from Palanca, Angola. It was scheduled to travel to Aruba
after Galveston.
   Elf Trading Inc., a Houston subsidiary of a French oil and gas
company, owned the cargo and said it would participate in the
cleanup.
   The Mega Borg was carrying more than three times as much oil as
was spilled by the Exxon Valdez off Alaska in March 1989 in the
nation's worst oil spill. But authorities noted the oil spilled in
Alaska was heavy crude, which doesn't dissipate nearly as rapidly
as light crude.

   On most nights, the Nightingale, the
Flying Carpet and the King clamber along the rocky smugglers' trail
in the foothills of Mount Hermon between Lebanon, Syria and Israel.
   Carrying American cigarettes, Scotch whisky and electrical
appliances for Syria on their backs, they run the gantlet of Syrian
and Israeli soldiers dug in along a front that threads across the
snow-capped, 9,200-foot mountain.
   On the return leg, they carry diesel fuel from Iran and other
goods that are prized in lawless Lebanon, where civil war began in
1975 and central authority collapsed long ago.
   The Nightingale, the Flying Carpet and the King are mules
specially trained for the six-hour trek on and around Mount Hermon,
where the borders of Lebanon, Syria and Israel intersect.
   Because of their special skills, each mule is worth about
$3,000, twice the average for a pack animal in southeast Lebanon.
Those skills include recognizing and running from anyone in
military uniform and leading pack trains of up to 100 mules.
   ``It's a no-man's land out there,'' said Adnan Daher, a
16-year-old smuggler. ``The Israelis are on a hill to the west, the
Syrians on a hill to the east and Lebanon behind us.''
   No accurate figures on the smuggling trade are available, but
diplomats in Syria say it amounts to hundreds of millions of
dollars a year.
   Shebaa, a predominantly Sunni Moslem town in the
Israeli-occupied sector of south Lebanon, has been a smugglers'
haven for decades. The men of Shebaa have traditionally defied
authority.
   About 5,000 of Shebaa's original population of 200,000 still
live there, said Mohammed Zoheiri, a sprightly man of 90 who has
been mukhtar, or mayor, for 45 years.
   The others went to Beirut, other parts of Lebanon or the
oil-rich Persian Gulf states because ``work opportunities are
scarce here,'' Zoheiri said whlle sipping tea with visitors.
   He said the ``mulers'' as he calls them, ``have known no other
way of making a living. They were born on muleback.''
   Some of his 40 grandsons are mulers, as his own father was,
Zoheiri said, and added: ``It's Shebaa's profession.''
   Over the border in Syria is Sirghaya, the nerve center of Syrian
smugglers, where half the 15,000 people live off the contraband
business.
   ``They'd have to arrest the whole town if they wanted to stop
us,'' said a merchant in nearby Madaya, the main outlet for the
smuggled goods. He was unwrapping high-heeled Italian shoes that
had just crossed the frontier.
   Although it costs money in lost tax revenue, diplomats say, the
illegal trade also helps the troubled Syrian economy.
   A recent report by the U.S. Embassy in Damascus said: ``The
off-the-books economy is both a sore point and a salvation. The
black market provides badly needed goods and in many ways keeps the
economy going.''
   Because of the steady flow of contraband, the planners of
Syria's socialist economy do not have to divert precious foreign
exchange for imports. President Hafez Assad's government generally
turns a blind eye as long as the trade keeps to border towns.
   Diplomats in Damascus said there even was a sizable illicit
trade in goods from Israel through the Israeli-occupied zone in
south Lebanon.
   Iron reinforcing bars and other building materials are
particularly prized in Syria. The U.S. Embassy report said Syrian
construction workers ``would be out of jobs but for smuggled
building materials.''
   Daher, the 16-year-old smuggler from Shebaa, said after a recent
nocturnal expedition: ``We provide whatever our Syrian partners
demand.''
   He said the Shebaa men hand over their loads to Syrian mule
trains.
   Each mule carries about 100 kilograms, or 220 pounds. Each
smuggler owns two mules and clears about $100 a week, four times
the average wage in Lebanon.
   ``Syrian soldiers usually start intercepting us after the snow
melts,'' said a smuggler who identified himself only as Ahmed. ``We
move to another unloading spot close to the Israeli-controlled
hill. The Syrians don't go there.''
   A few days earlier, a Syrian customs patrol fired on a pack
train from Shebaa and killed a mule, but the smugglers escaped with
the rest of their animals.
   Shebaa smugglers have 600 to 800 mules, said Amin, a 51-year-old
who has been in the trade since boyhood.
   ``It's a dangerous profession, but Shebaa's smugglers rarely get
killed,'' he said. ``We know our way and the lead mules are well
trained.''
   Most Shebaa men killed in recent years were victims of land
mines, he said.
   Amin said it takes up to three months to train a lead mule,
which should be ``big, strong, healthy and smart.''
   A mule chosen as a leader is kept in an ``isolated, dark stable
without food or water for two days,'' he said.
   ``Then a man, who shouldn't be a smuggler because the mule would
get used to his smell, goes in dressed as a soldier and beats the
mule with a stick,'' Amin said. ``A smuggler goes in after him and
gives the mule food and water.'' He said the ``soldier'' fires a
rifle near the mule during the beating. ``The `soldier' becomes the
mule's enemy,'' he explained, ``and the animal tries to escape the
minute a soldier is seen or a bullet is fired. At this point, the
mule becomes eligible to lead a caravan.''

<HEAD>California's `Worst of the Worst' Moving to High-Tech Prison</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HOWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CRESCENT CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is a new home for the ``worst
of the worst,'' the most violent and escape-prone of California's
92,000 prison inmates. It is Pelican Bay, an eerie, high-tech
prison within a prison that is touted as the nation's most secure
lockup.
   Its name ay make it sound like a resort, but Pelican Bay is a
stark, silent, X-shaped place monitored by video cameras and
microphones. Here, more than 1,000 prisoners live in a world of
concrete and steel and silence, confined to their 80-square-foot
cells for 22{ hours a day. They are allowed out for a 90-minute
exercise period, alone and without athletic equipment, in a tiny
concrete ``yard'' with 20-foot-high walls.
   The prisoners in the Security Housing Unit, the core of the
Pelican Bay State Prison, are set apart from the rest of the prison
population. They live in eight-cell ``pods,'' one man to a cell.
Each pod has its own adjacent exercise area.
   The other inmates, about 1,700 in the general population, are
treated like conventional prisoners. They have access to barbells
and basketballs. They eat in the prison kitchen and spend time in
the ``day room,'' with telephones and cable television. They can
have conjugal visits with spouses.
   But the Security Housing Unit prisoners exist in isolation.
   ``These are the worst of the worst, the ones who have shown they
can't be managed safely,'' said Lt. Al Deines, a prison spokesman.
``They have assaulted the staff, or they have had heavy possession
of drugs, or they are verified members of gangs.''
   Pelican Bay opened its well-secured doors seven months ago.
Previously, the state's worst prisoners usually went to San Quentin
or Folsom prisons _ places rich in the folklore of criminology but
no longer adequate for the state's huge prison population.
   At Pelican Bay, prisoners are shackled and flanked by two
truncheon-wielding officers every time they are moved outside their
cells.
   Aside from that, guards have little direct contact with the
prisoners. They open the sliding cell doors _ slabs of steel
perforated with small holes _ by remote control pneumatics, and
they use loudspeakers to direct the inmates in and out. Except for
the periodic sound of a door slamming or a voice on a speaker, the
Security Housing Unit _ the ``Shu'' _ is strangely quiet.
   ``Listen!'' an officer tells a visitor. ``What do you hear?
Nothing. It's not like other prisons.''
   An armed guard in an enclosed glass-and-steel control booth
monitors groups of pods. Above the corridors, a heavy mesh screen
allows guards to walk overhead, and the upper ceiling is laced with
pipes that can spew water or tear gas in an emergency.
   The design for the Shu was patterned partly after a 700-inmate
prison in Florence, Ariz., but the Pelican Bay prison is larger,
with major differences in design. Warden Charles Marshall describes
it as ``unique in the nation.''
   Outside, the gray gravel compound is as deserted as a
ghost-town, ringed by concentric chain-link fences topped with
razor wire and armed guards. Although surrounded by California's
lushest forests, the fenced prison site has no shrubs, no
vegetation at all to break the line of sight.
   The inner fence sounds an alarm at a touch. In the ground, just
under the earth, special sensor cables criss-cross the prison
grounds, and will trigger an alarm if more than 40 pounds of
pressure is applied. The guards, one each in 11 towers spaced 700
feet apart, are armed with .223-caliber carbines.
   The prison is a scant 50 yards from U.S. 101, but invisible
behind dense coastal forests. There are no signs, no marked
turnoffs, no direct access from the highway to the prison, about 10
miles south of the Oregon line and four miles from the ocean.
   Occasionally, passersby catch a glimpse of a guard tower through
the trees and wander onto the grounds surrounding the compound to
investigate the nearly quarter-billion-dollar prison.
   ``That makes the tower guards very nervous,'' Deines said.

   America's teaching force is aging, and reformers
fear the trend could thwart the drive toward school improvement.
   During the last 20 years, the average age of the nation's 2.3
million public school teachers rose from 36 to 41, according to
statistics from the National Education Association. Unpublished
data from the 1988 Current Population Survey of the Census Bureau
shows that 48.4 percent are 40 or older.
   Educators have usually invoked such statistics as evidence that
mass teacher retirements lie ahead _ with no certainty that the
profession is attractive enough to draw young recruits.
   Half to 54 percent of the nation's teachers will be eligible for
retirement by the year 2000, said Jewell Gould, research director
of the American Federation of Teachers.
   This ``graying'' of the profession contains other worrisome
messages, several reformers believe. Age statistics suggest that a
decade of school reform has been at least partly misdirected.
   ``School reformers haven't looked a lot at the fact that in a
decade, many of the teachers who will be in the schools are not
there now,'' said Linda Darling-Hammond, a professor at Columbia
Teachers College and an authority on the teaching profession.
   Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching, said the numbers mean the nation had
better pay more heed to improving the training of the next
generation of teachers. He said this group will carry the burden of
reform for years to come.
   He said it was a mistake to focus almost exclusively on present
teachers.
   ``Both older and younger teachers have to be considered, but if
I were to draw a conclusion, I'd say we have been far too
neglectful of educating the new generation of teachers who will be
determining where schools will be going in the first quarter of the
21st century,'' said Boyer in a recent interview.
   Darling-Hammond added it's generally easier to train a new
teacher in reform techniques such as team teaching than it is to
persuade a veteran teacher to break long-cherished classroom habits.
   Some teacher colleges have begun to address these problems. The
``Holmes Group,'' a coalition of about 100 education schools
interested in reform, is fostering programs allowing student
teachers to practice new techniques in public school classrooms.
Several such programs have started recently in Michigan, for
example.
   The rise in the average age of teachers during the last two
decades mirrors declining student enrollments and tight state
school budgets. Those trends have been most pronounced in the
Midwest and Northeast.
   Not all states keep teacher age data. But a check of state
departments of education and local union affiliates found the
average age of teachers in Connecticut, for example, is 43.3; in
Georgia, 42; Indiana, 42; Michigan, 44; Maryland, 41.1; and New
Jersey, 42.5.
   The median age in New York was 42.4 as the 1988-89 school year,
and 25.1 percent of the teaching force is 49 or older.
   In Massachusetts, suffering the effects of a decade-old tax
revolt measure and a worsening budget crisis, the average age is 47.
   By contrast, teachers in New Mexico, a Sunbelt state with a
growing student population, average 37.7.
   Reformers concerned over average age emphasize they don't mean
to belittle the skills of veteran teachers.
   ``More experienced teachers are more productive. They just won't
make the mistakes a younger teacher would,'' said Gould.
   Nonetheless, the age statistics lend urgency to the need to
update the skills of veteran teachers and create more collegial
environments in public schools, said Darling-Hammond.
   ``By and large, teacher effectiveness increases during the first
five to seven years of a career, then levels off and may even
decline. Whether that happens depends on the school environment.
Collegial environments that have lots of opportunities to develop
and learn help foster professional growth. But that's not
typical,'' she said.
   Educators believe that school improvement is most likely to take
root in schools with a balanced mix of young and old teachers.
   ``From what I see, whether or not a person is willing to take a
look at innovative ideas has little to do with age,'' said Keith
Geiger, president of the National Education Association. ``I hear
as many innovative ideas from 50 year-olds as 25 year-olds.''
   But statistics suggest that the balance has swung toward a
heavier concentration of veteran teachers, many of whom have seen
reform waves come and go with little apparent effect and may be
viewing current reform efforts skeptically.
   ``I think all teachers want to be part of exciting changes,''
Boyer said. ``But we have to ask: Which teachers will be prepared
to harness technology? Will they be prepared to deal with an
increasingly bilingual population? Will they be prepared to be
creative and not just conforming?''

   Summertime, and the programming's easy.
   Eight of the top 10 shows on television last week were reruns.
   A ``Roseanne'' retread on ABC was No. 1. A carbon of NBC's
``Cheers'' was No. 2. A replay of ``The Cosby Show'' on NBC and a
rehash of ``Designing Women'' on CBS tied for third, according to
figures Tuesday from the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   NBC was No. 1, as usual. But CBS, in last place for virtually
all of the fall season, continued its spring and summer revival by
placing second. ABC was last.
   The only original programming in the top 10 were the comedy
``The Seinfeld Chronicles'' on NBC, which tied for seventh place,
and ``The Search for Matthew,'' a ``48 Hours'' special on CBS,
which ranked 10th.
   Fox did not duplicate its precedent-setting finish in the
previous week's ratings, when it placed two shows in the top 10.
``The Simpsons'' dropped to No. 13, and ``Married ... With
Children'' fell to 19th. Both were reruns.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating. Each
ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   ``Roseanne,'' ABC, 16.8; ``Cheers,'' NBC, 15.4; ``The Cosby
Show,'' NBC and ``Designing Women,'' CBS, both 14.7; ``Unsolved
Mysteries,'' NBC, 14.6; ``A Different World,'' NBC, 14.4; ``The
Seinfeld Chronicles,'' NBC, 14.2; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 14.2;
``Coach,'' ABC, 13.8; and ``48 Hours'' special, CBS, 13.7.
   Overall, NBC had an average rating of 10.8, CBS a 9.8 and ABC a
9.7.
   In the network news battle, ABC was way out in front with a 9.5
average. CBS had a 7.7 and NBC 7.4.

<HEAD>Honecker Wants His Cash Converted to West German Marks, Lawyer
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Erich Honecker's lawyer says the ousted East
German leader should be allowed to convert his cash to West German
marks when the German states merge their economies next month, a
newspaper reported.
   The 77-year-old former hard-line Communist Party chief and his
wife, Margot, have about 300,000 East German marks in personal
savings, according to attorney Friedrich Wolff, the West German
newspaper Die Welt said.
   It quoted Wolff as saying the money was legally acquired and
should be treated like the savings of other East Germans.
   West German marks will become the currency of East Germany on
July 2, when the nations merge their economies, a key step in
unification.
   Under a formula for replacing the nearly worthless East German
mark, older people would have savings of up to 6,000 marks
converted at a 1-to-1 rate, and amounts higher than that at a
2-to-1 rate.
   Honecker's money would be valued at 153,000 West German marks
($90,270).
   Honecker and other officials of the former Communist regime,
toppled in October, were taken to a police hospital in East Berlin
on May 28.
   The mostly elderly ex-leaders are being examined to determine
whether they are physically and mentally fit to be prosecuted for
alleged crimes.
   Honecker is in failing health and had been in a Soviet military
hospital in the town of Beelitz before he was brought to East
Berlin.
   East German officials have changed signals several times on
whether to prosecute members of the old guard. Most of the charges
against Honecker and other officials center on abuse of office and
corruption. Party leaders are believed to have amassed large
amounts of cash and property.
   Die Welt said in Tuesday's report that the government has begun
criminal proceedings aimed at confiscating Honecker's wealth,
making it unlikely the former party chief will be allowed to
convert his cash.
   Wolff said he would file a claim for compensation on Honecker's
behalf unless the ex-leader is allowed to convert his savings.
   He said he does not expect Honecker to be prosecuted.
   ``Already today can I determine ... actual legal grounds for
criminal prosecution are not apparent,'' he was quoted as saying.

   Abortion has emerged as one
of the most emotional unification issues facing the Germanys, and
people in both nations are debating which state's abortion law
should prevail.
   West Germany restricts abortions to three situtions: medical
necessity, rape or incest, and dire social or economic hardship. In
East Germany, first trimester abortions are performed cost-free
upon demand.
   Numbers reflect the widely varying laws.
   In East Germany, with a population of 16 million, 73,000
abortions were performed last year. In West Germany, whose
population is four times higher, there were 75,297 legal abortions.
   East German doctors are prohibited from performing abortions on
foreigners except in cases of emergency, but pregnant West German
women are already crossing the border, hoping to take advantage of
the looser law.
   The two Germanys plan to unite under the West German
constitution as the quickest way to merge. Economic unity is to
take place on July 2 and full union could come later this year.
   The West German government, led by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, says
its constitution bars an abortion law such as East Germany's.
   ``The right of the unborn child to live is not open to question
under our constitution,'' said Norbert Greis, a legal expert for
West Germany's Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party to
Kohl's Christian Democrats.
   Not everyone in Kohl's coalition agrees, however.
   West German Justice Minister Hans Engelhard has suggested two
different abortion laws could exist for an interim period after
unification. The arch-conservative Christian Social Union says that
would be out of the question.
   The West German Social Democrats say East Germany's law is a
good model for a united Germany's abortion regulations, arguing it
places more importance on a woman's rights.
   ``Women in East Germany would certainly not abide seeing their
long-valid abortion law fall victim to a harmonization of
inter-German law,'' said lawmaker Renate Schmidt, a Social Democrat.
   Many East German women say he's right.
   ``Changing the abortion regulations would only bring trouble for
us,'' said a young, pregnant East German woman, registering for an
abortion at a women's clinic in Heiligenstadt, a rural East German
border town.
   East Germans are expected to face considerable economic hardship
following unification because thousands of people are expected to
lose their jobs and prices will soar. Many fear an abortion law
like West Germany's could increase the economic burden on families
by forcing them to have unwanted children.
   Christa Schmidt, East Germany's minister for family and women's
affairs, said she would not ``budge an inch'' on abortion rights.
   Although East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere has not
spoke out on the issue, many members of his Christian Democratic
Union disagree with Ms. Schmidt.
   Dr. Rudolf Kessel, chief doctor at the Heiligenstadt clinic,
says he thinks East German women are too easygoing about abortions.
   ``For a lot of women abortion is simply seen as a form of birth
control, especially in the big industrial cities. This is the dark
side of our law,'' Kessel said.
   West Germany's law, passed in 1972, makes it extremely difficult
for a woman to get an abortion. Those who request abortions on
economic or social grounds must get two doctors to confirm their
case is legitimate, and must show proof of being counseled on
adoption and welfare assistance.
   In East Germany, a doctor can reject a request for an abortion
only if the first 12 weeks of a pregnany have passed, Kessel said.
   Many West German women travel to the Netherlands for abortions,
where the law is less strict. Some fear a type of ``abortion
tourism'' will extend to East Germany unless the nations bring
their abortion laws into line.
   Abortion has long been a highly emotional issue in West Germany.
   Last year, the conviction of a prominent Bavarian gynecologist
caused a huge national stir and is still widely debated.
   Dr. Horst Theissen, found guilty by a Bavarian court of failing
to follow abortion guidelines, was banned from practicing as a
gynecologist for three years.
   Bavaria state, predominantly Catholic, also tried 156 of
Theissen's patients, who were accused of having abortions under the
hardship clause without proof of the required counseling. Most were
fined up to $1,600.
   The trial resulted in charges among opposition politicians that
West Germany's abortion law was ``one of the most backward in
Europe.''
   Abortion has not been such a heated issue in predominantly
Protestant East Germany. Nonetheless, there are strong
anti-abortion sentiments in Roman Catholic pockets, such as
Heiligenstadt.

   An American Airlines jetliner with 70 people
on board made an emergency landing in Omaha after losing cabin
pressure, but no one was injured, officials said.
   ``I think everybody was pretty calm,'' said Jeremy Turk, 33, a
passenger on Flight 840 from Oakland to Chicago. ``It was quite
uneventful.''
   The McDonnell Douglas Super 80, carrying 64 passengers and a
six-member crew, made the unscheduled but safe landing at Eppley
Airfield at 11:50 a.m. CDT, officials said.
   Passengers remained in the twin-engine jet for about an hour
before entering the airport, and were given boarding passes for
another flight to Chicago.
   The cause of the loss in cabin pressure was not known, said
American Airlines spokesman Al Becker.
   Becker did not know the plane's altitude when the problem
developed.
   Most of the people on the jet were asleep when pressure was
lost, several passengers said.
   ``All of a sudden, it was `Ding, ding,' and the masks fell down
in front of my face,'' said Joe Sivertsen, 21. ``I woke up and
said, `Oh, that's nice, now what's happening?''
   ``It was handled very well by the flight crew,'' Turk said.

<HEAD>Times of London Reluctantly Enters Modern Era With Style Changes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The venerable Times of London has bowed to the
demands of a vulgar modern age, revising its Victorian-era style
guide to include such brash and contemporary language as the title
``Ms.''
   The 205-year-old newspaper _ whose readers tend to regard its
eccentricities as a national treasure on the order of Big Ben _
introduced the usage changes in Tuesday's editions.
   Editor Simon Jenkins tried to break the news gently.
   ``The mirror that a newspaper holds up to the world is
constantly smudged with jargon, bad usage and verbosity,'' wrote
Jenkins, who took over in March. ``A style guide is a periodic
cleansing of that mirror.''
   The Times style guide, introduced at the turn of the century,
was last revamped in the mid-1960s.
   There were regular updates but the guide remained ``terribly
restrictive and quite Victorian,'' said literary editor Philip
Howard, who helped write the new guide.
   Even so, he was quick to point out, it was ``very magnificent,
with high standards.''
   The old style guide was replete with arcane treasures such as
The Times' singular spelling of Mikhail S. ``Gorbachov.'' Its
rendering of the Soviet leader's name was based on its
transliteration of the Cyrillic letters.
   ``Our Russian specialists know that our spelling is better, but
if the rest of the world spells it another way, ours looks very
odd,'' Howard said. ``We're right, but we're wrong.''
   So from now on, it's Gorbachev.
   Under the old style, The Times referred to Leonardo da Vinci's
masterpiece as the ``Monna Lisa,'' a spelling that might seem to
some as mysterious as the lady's smile. It will revert to ``Mona
Lisa.''
   ``The old Times style book said that one should always spell
`Monna Lisa' with two n's to show that we are gents and that we
know that it comes from Monna, which is derived from the Italian
Madonna,'' said Howard.
   But that and other displays of erudition, he conceded, also
``came to look very odd.''
   The Times is under siege from more than modern usage.
Circulation dropped to 434,389 in daily sales this spring compared
with 442,109 a year previously.
   A new highbrow newspaper, The Independent, was started 3{ years
ago and is fast closing in on The Times with daily sales of 416,200.
   Under the new style guide, there were changes in courtesy titles
for both men and women.
   From now on, ``Ms.'' will be automatically used in Times news
columns for American women. For the rest of womanhood, it will be
trotted out on special request.
   The Times is bracing for some flak over that one.
   ``When ``Ms.'' is used in the Times we get angry letters, often
written by women, who want to know what is that vulgar new word and
how do you pronounce it,'' said Howard, author of ``We Thundered
Out: 200 Years of the Times 1785-1985.''
   Howard thinks use of Ms. will make journalists' jobs easier,
however.
   ``It is awkward for a reporter to have to go up to a woman after
a lecture and ask her if she is married,'' Howard said. ``A younger
woman is likely to tell them to mind their own business and they
may get a clip around the ears with a handbag.''
   The Associated Press Stylebook, style guide for many U.S.
newspapers, prescribes using ``Ms.'' before a woman's last name if
she prefers it.
   The Times is also dropping courtesy titles on first reference _
something certain to disappoint readers who enjoyed such prim
designations as Mr. Ringo Starr.
   On subsequent reference, most people continue to get a title,
except criminals, artists, athletes and the long dead.
   Some modern words introduced in earlier revisions of the style
guide have now come to seem dated. The hippies of the '60s who
gathered for summer solstice celebrations at the 4,000-year-old
Stonehenge monument in southern England have become ``travelers''
in the modern Times.
   ``The words of a generation ago _ like `hippie' _ sound absurdly
old-fashioned,'' said Howard. ``Newspapers have a duty to use the
language of the current generation.''
   The new guide also has a blacklist _ words that ``slip into
journalese as a form of obfuscation and circumlocution and
gobbledygook,'' he said.
   These include: problem, provision, very, issue, accommodate,
crisis, interesting, and situation. Especially ``crisis
situation.'' And ``probe.''
   ``Words like probe should be confined to stories about
surgeons,'' he said.

   Tiny minis, brisk bike tights and beautifully cut
jackets set the pace for the Chanel cruise wear shown in the
original Rue Cabon salon where Coco herself once presided.
   It was Chanel's first show devoted to cruise wear ``though we
have been making it for years,'' said Chanel's designer, Karl
Lagerfeld.
   ``This was my idea, to have an intimate lunch show to launch the
between-season clothes and set them off,'' he said at a catered
champagne lunch after the show Tuesday.
   Top couture seamstress directors work better ``when they know
they'll be admired by the press and a larger audience, not just in
a showroom,'' he added.
   The line of clothes for ``cruising'' _ whether aboard a boat, in
the street or at polo clubs _ looked like sharp versions of what
Lagerfeld has been doing for a couple of seasons at Chanel, for
whom he has been head designer since 1983.
   He topped most of them with beautiful, oversized boater hats.
   Neat and put together well, they looked angled to sell. They
ranged from beautifully cut navy shantung jackets with patch
pockets to little robin's-egg blue or tea-rose pink boucle suits.
The details were sharply etched.
   The late-day wear featured some beautifully classic
black-and-white outfits in crepe de chine and pleated shortie
chiffon skirts, Lagerfeld's original vision of Chanel of yore.
   He also featured his current favorite shades of hot coral, peach
and soft wisteria for next winter's sunny resort wear.
   For those with great figures, the skintight navy jersey sailor
suits with middy-style tops were worn with gold-buttoned bermuda or
corsair-length clinging pants.
   The only criticism was that it all looked terribly Junior Miss,
even in beautiful boucle tweed suits featuring raspberry or lime
plaids _ fine for young girls and older sophisticates like Audrey
Hepburn, but perhaps a bit flighty for the likes of French
politicians' wives, who often favor Chanel.
   ``Many women can wear these clothes,'' said Lagerfeld, hinting
that perhaps a few skirts will come out longer in the boutiques.
   Lagerfeld himself wore a blazer and tie with a cameo tie clip,
his usual ponytail, and dark glasses by Christian Dior.
   The little Chanel trapeze-line coats with their double-breasted
gold button effects and the light pink poplin pants suits evoked
luxury cruise liners in 1958, when Lagerfeld was a teen-ager
learning design in Paris.
   But the traditional quality was there as well, and Chanel was
proud to show it off up close.
   The cruise line wear is not cheap: Outfits will be in the
$2,000-plus range, on a par with the ready-to-wear.
   With Lagerfeld at the helm, the world's most copied house is
stil keeping a jump ahead of the rip-off artists.

<HEAD>East German Christian Democrats Call For December All-German
Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's leading political party has
called for both German states to elect a single government in
December.
   The Christian Democrat caucus in Parliament said Tuesday that it
would seek to have lawmakers vote on German unification this summer
and that all-German elections should be held no later than
mid-December.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany has been pressing for
all-German elections in December in place of the West German
elections set for Dec. 2.
   East Germany held its first free elections on March 18, ending
four decades of Communist rule.
   East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, the leader of the
Christian Democrats, has been noncommittal about holding December
elections.
   De Maiziere was on a state visit to the United States on
Tuesday, but Guenther Krause, leader of the Christian Democratic
faction in Parliament, said de Maiziere favored the proposal.
   Krause said the Christian Democrats would soon begin talks on
the proposal with other parties in their governing coalition, which
includes the left-leaning Social Democrats.
   The East Germany Social Democratic leader, Wolfgang Thierse,
said his party opposes the elections because details of unification
must first be worked out.
   Social Democrats in both countries favor a slower pace for
reunification while the conservative Christian Democrats have been
seeking to move the process as quickly as possible.
   Many analysts believe Kohl, the leader of West Germany's
Christian Democrats, would make a stronger showing in an all-German
balloting than in West German elections.
   East Germany's Christian Democrats enjoy a larger margin of
support than their counterparts in West Germany.

<HEAD>Noted Jewish Leader Solomon Freehof Dead At 97</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solomon B. Freehof, a rabbi who was considered
one of the world's foremost Reform Jewish leaders died Tuesday of
an undisclosed cause at Montefiore Hospital. He was 97.
   Freehof was elected president of the World Union for Progressive
Judaism in 1959. He was the first American accorded that honor,
which was seen as an acknowledgment of his stature in Reform
Judaism.
   He also was president of the Central Conference of American
Rabbis and as a member of the executive board of the Union of
American Hebrew Congregations. He was honored in 1979 by the
National Conference of Christians and Jews.
   A native of London, Freehof came to the United States in 1911.
He was an honors graduate of Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati,
where he later taught, and served as a Jewish chaplain for American
soldiers in Europe during World War I.
   Freehof's first congregation was at the Kehillath Anshe Mayriv
Temple in Chicago, which he left in 1934 to come to Pittsburgh. He
served as rabbi at the Rodef Shalom Temple in the city's Shadyside
neighborhood until his retirement in 1966.
   On retiring, he remembered his career this way: ``It's a happy
profession provided that a man is suited for it, and to whom public
life is not a trial.
   ``Religion brings out the best side of people and the minister
represents the best,'' he said. ``The ministry has become a public
service.''
   Freehof is survived by his wife, Lillian. She is the author of
more than 20 books of Jewish legend and children's stories.

<HEAD>World's Most Expensive Decorator Dead at 71</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Valerian S. Rybar, known as the world's most
expensive interior designer, has died of prostate cancer. He was 71.
   Rybar, internationally known for creating opulent rooms and
extravagant party designs, died Saturday at his Manhattan home,
said his partner, Jean-Francois Daigre.
   Rybar's clients included Nicholas and Genvieve DuPont, Samuel
and Mitzi Newhouse, Pierre and Sao Schlumberger, Christina Onassis
and Stavros Niarchos.
   He designed many of the furniture pieces and rugs he used,
employing artisans from all over the world. He often chose opulent
fabrics like satins trimmed with gold thread or red velvet.
   Mirrors and steel were Rybar signatures.
   ``The real luxury today is not that one incredible piece of
furniture,'' he once said. ``It's perfect cooking and grooming
facilities and perfect storage.''
   The native of Yugoslavia began his career as a trainee at the
Lord &amp; Taylor department store in New York. Soon after he quit, he
designed a headdress for an opera singer.
   Cosmetics company founder Elizabeth Arden saw it and ``took him
under her wing,'' Daigre said.
   He stayed at Arden for three years, then began working on party
designs and soon was hired by some of his clients to help them with
their homes.
   Daigre joined Rybar in 1968. Their company had offices in New
York and Paris.
   There are no survivors.

<HEAD>Woman Agrees to Shut Down Shelter While Settlement Negotiated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TRUMBULL, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who angered neighbors and got in
trouble with zoning authorities for taking in homeless mothers said
Tuesday she would close down the operation and seek approval to run
it as a shelter.
   In a letter to this southwestern Connecticut town's zoning
enforcment officer, Donna Russell said she was ready to comply with
the Dec. 15 order banning her from operating her lakefront home as
a shelter.
   Russell wrote Donald Murray that she has agreed to go along with
the order on the understanding that she and her 18-year-old son,
Daniel, will not be fined and that no further action will be taken
against them if she complies within a reasonable time.
   Last week, officials warned that Russell's son, the legal owner
of the house, faced arrest on a misdemeanor charge of violating
local zoning ordinances if the matter remained unresolved.
   Russell asked in her letter that she be given time to find
alternate housing for the two women currently living in her home.
   The town issued its December cease-and-desist order after local
officials concluded that Russell was operating a homeless shelter
in violation of local zoning law. The law requires that
three-quarters of the people living in a single family dwelling be
related by blood, marriage or adoption.
   In her letter, Russell wrote, ``I still believe that the town's
actions against me were unfair and unconstitutional.''

<HEAD>Fortunes Turn for Texas, Massachusetts Banks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas banks are back in the black after more
than four years of steady losses, while once-thriving Massachusetts
institutions have become the industry's biggest money-losers.
   Nationally, commercial banks earned $6.2 billion in the first
three months of 1990, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said
Tuesday. The performance, except for a sharp earnings dip in the
last half of 1989, was in line with bank profits over the past two
years.
   But the overall performance masked dramatic turnarounds in some
states.
   Texas banks, which lost $42 million during the first quarter of
1989, turned a profit of $164 million in the first quarter of this
year. It was their first quarter in the black since the last
quarter of 1985.
   Massachusetts banks went the other direction. They earned $202
million in the first quarter last year but lost $171 million in the
January-March 1990 period, the worst loss of any state. The other
states to post losses were New Hampshire and Rhode Island _ which
border Massachusetts _ and Arizona.
   Economists said the reversal was telling evidence of the
phenomenon of rolling recessions that have moved from region to
region while the economy nationally has expanded for more than
seven years.
   ``One of the characteristics of the 1980s was the rolling
recession,'' said James J. McDermott Jr., an analyst with Keefe,
Bruyette &amp; Woods, a New York securities firm. ``Now we are having
rolling recoveries as well.
   ``As banks in the Northeast experience pressure, banks in the
Southwest are showing signs of stability and in some cases slight
improvement.''
   The problems in both Texas and Massachusetts stem from sharp
drops in real estate values. But now Texas real estate is
recovering as New England's declines.
   In Massachusetts, 9.22 percent of banks' real estate loans were
delinquent in the first three months of 1990, up from 6.89 percent
in the previous quarter. In Texas, the delinquency rate fell from
10.34 percent to 6.76 percent.
   The FDIC said much of the improvement in Texas, however, could
be attributed to the agency's bank rescues.
   ``Absent government assistance, there are no indicators yet of a
strong performance rebound by Texas banks,'' it said.
   Economists said tough action by regulators forcing New England
banks to take losses this year could benefit them in the long run.
   ``1990 is going to be a down year for a lot of banks, but it's
conceivable if we get through 1990 without a significant weakening
of the economy that they could resume healthy growth,'' said Robert
Litan of the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman characterized bank performance
nationally as ``not a bad result given all the publicity given to
real estate problems.''
   But analysts said it would take a downturn at only a few large
banks to cause trouble for the insurance fund, which posted
back-to-back losses in 1988 and 1989, even if most of the industry
is healthy.
   ``The FDIC can still lose its shirt on the bottom 10 percent. In
fact, it can lose ... everything it's wearing and everything in the
house,'' Litan said.
   The percentage of banks losing money rose to 10.15 in the first
quarter from 9.12 percent in the fourth quarter of 1989.

<HEAD>AG Said Within Law in Heading Clean Air Talks Despite Investments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government officials say Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh acted within the law in heading discussions on revising
the Clean Air Act even though 20 percent of his assets are in
stocks affected by the legislation.
   President Bush granted ethics-law waivers to Thornburgh last
spring so the attorney general could head Domestic Policy Council
discussions leading to proposals to amend the Clean Air Act,
administration officials said.
   Thornburgh needed the waivers because he held $149,827 in stocks
and bonds in 12 major industrial and oil companies and a public
utility, Alvin A. Schall, a Thornburgh aide, said Tuesday.
   These holdings amounted to 20 percent of the attorney general's
assets of $722,083, Schall said.
   Federal conflict-of-interest law bars high-ranking government
officials from participating in decisions that would affect them
personally.
   But the law allows for granting waivers if the financial
interest ``is not so substantial'' or was ``too remote or too
inconsequential to affect the integrity of government officer's or
employee's services.''
   ``You probably could make a pretty good argument that it isn't
even necessary to get a waiver, but just to be safe we did,''
Schall said.
   He said the clean-air waivers were sought even though there was
only ``a very attenuated relationship'' between any action the
council might take on clean-air issues and the value of
Thornburgh's investments.
   The Office of Government Ethics did not object to the waivers,
deputy director Donald Campbell said.
   ``The statute allows the appointing authority, in this case the
president, to find that a financial holding is not so substantial
and significant as to affect performance,'' Campbell said.
   ``If he was taking action that would specifically affect one of
those companies, a waiver is not the way to resolve it,'' he added.
   Thornburgh obtained the clean-air waivers in May 1989 when the
Domestic Policy Council, which he chairs, was considering acid
rain, toxic emissions from factories and ozone pollution.
   The attorney general's investments covered by the two waivers
included holdings in four oil companies _ Amoco Corp., Atlantic
Richfield, Mobil Corp., and Shell Oil Co., _ and General Motors,
General Electric and Westinghouse.
   The other affected holdings were investments in Wisconsin Public
Service Corp., Arco Chemical Corp., Black &amp; Decker Corp., PPG
Industries, Inc., Procter &amp; Gamble Co., and Eastman Kodak Co.
   The waiver for acid-rain covered the Wisconsin utility, in which
Thornburgh has less than a $5,000 investment. The investments cited
for a potential conflict-of-interest in discussion of
toxic-emission issues amounted to 16 percent of the attorney
general's assets. Holdings implicated by the ozone issue amounted
to 4 percent of Thornburgh's assets, Schall said.
   According to the financial statement Thornburgh filed last
month, those holdings were worth between $109,000 and $365,000, or
37 percent of an investment portfolio valued between $287,000 and
$977,000.
   The financial disclosure law requires federal officials to
report only broad ranges in the value of their stock and bond
holdings. Schall provided the details on the value of the stock in
oil and industrial companies at the time the waiver was granted 13
months ago.
   At that time, Thornburgh calculated the value of the affected
holdings according to their current market value, Schall said.
   Thornburgh was also granted a waiver to participate in the
drafting of legislation to ease antitrust restrictions to encourage
the formation of joint-production ventures, Schall said.
   Thornburgh cited holdings in American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
and International Business Machines Corp. as posing a potential
conflict of interest. The attorney general's holdings in each of
the two companies is valued between $5,000 and $15,000, according
to his latest financial disclosure statement.
   The waiver to help write joint-production legislation was sought
because both AT&amp;T and IBM are involved in the research involving
high-definition television, Schall said.
   Thornburgh has shunned involvement in a number of issues because
of his financial holdings.

<TEXT>
   Feminist groups announced a boycott Tuesday
against Esquire magazine, saying they're outraged by the latest
issue of the monthly featuring an article entitled ``Your Wife: An
Owner's Manual.''
   ``We find it to be literally an expression of the degradation of
women,'' said Tammy Bruce, president of the local chapter of the
National Organization for Woman.
   ``It puts us into a subhuman level, places women into a thing
mode,'' Bruce said in a telephone interview.
   The June edition of Esquire devotes several articles to wives
and lists ``The Twelve Virtues of the Perfect Wife,'' which
describes the ideal woman as obedient, thrifty and reverent.
   NOW and The Feminist Majority urged members and supporters to
mount a letter-writing and telephone campaign against Esquire. The
groups also urged subscribers to cancel and advertisers to withdraw
their ads.
   Calls to the New York-based magazine seeking comment were met
with busy signals for hours Tuesday.
   In a news conference at a newsstand, the feminist groups
demanded that Esquire's editor in chief, Lee Eisenberg, publicly
apologize and devote an upcoming issue to a realistic view of women.
   ``We want an issue devoted to a positive view of women in
society, that will look at violence against women and at the
women's movement,'' Bruce said.
   ``We're not saying don't publish, we're saying balance it,'' she
said.
   The current issue includes a special ``Owner's Manual'' pullout
section that includes article on `` Her Handbag,'' ``Her Bra,'' and
``Her Medicine Chest.''
   ``Her Plumbing'' shows a hand-drawn map of a wife's reproductive
organs represented as pipes, valves and other various elements of
household plumbing.
   Bruce conceded that some of the 17 articles in the issue are
spoofs, but said the joke went too far.

<HEAD>Bush Veto Sustained, But Democrats Have Second Chance</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush's string of successful vetoes
remains unbroken, but Democrats are maneuvering for a second chance
to force an Amtrak aid bill into law over his objections.
   Bush emerged Tuesday with the 11th veto of his term intact after
Democrats failed by three votes to muster the two-thirds majority
needed to override the president's veto of a bill to support the
rail service.
   The president vetoed the $2 billion authorization bill last
month because it also would have required that the Interstate
Commerce Commission approve acquisitions of major freight railroads
by non-railroad companies.
   Republicans promised during Tuesday's debate that Bush would
support a substitute bill continuing support for the passenger rail
service as long as the regulatory provision is omitted.
   ``If they send us the bill without the ICC provision, he'll sign
it,'' White House spokesman Steve Hart said after the 64-36 vote.
   Sixty-seven votes were needed. Democrats will really only need
to find two votes, however, since one of the 36 votes was that of
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Despite his desire to override the veto, Mitchell voted with 35
Republicans to sustain it. Since he was on the winning side,
Mitchell is able under Senate rules to call for a second vote if
Democrats can find the two extra votes needed to override.
   Those two votes will have to be Republicans, since all 55
Democrats in the Senate have come out for the override. There is no
deadline for the second vote.
   Party pride was at stake, said Sen. J. James Exon, D-Neb.
   ``I hope that we can get back not to what's nice for the party,
but what is right for America,'' he said. ``Overriding this veto is
certainly right for America and its transportation needs.''
   Despite the victory, it was the closest veto fight for Bush so
far. In the House last week, 58 Republicans joined 236 Democrats in
voting to override the Amtrak veto. It was the first time either
chamber had voted against the president. A two-thirds majority is
needed in both chambers to override a veto.
   Republicans have introduced bills in both chambers to authorize
federal spending for Amtrak, but without the regulatory provision
that prompted the veto. The Senate version was introduced on the
floor Tuesday night by Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont.
   The Bush administration and the Reagan administration before it
proposed to eliminate money for Amtrak from all their budget
requests. The bill Bush vetoed was not a funding bill but rather an
authorization bill. That means it gave Congress permission to
appropriate funds later for specific purposes.
   The ICC already must approve any sale of one railroad to
another. But supporters of the vetoed bill say the jurisdiction is
needed over acquisitions by non-railroad companies to prevent
against the dismantling of railroad assets to pay for the takeovers.
   ``What we want to avoid is a situation where people come in and
buy the railroad and then just dismember it,'' said Sen. Paul
Simon, D-Ill.
   In his veto message, Bush called the proposed ICC oversight ``an
unwarranted regulatory roadblock to the financial restructuring of
the railroad industry.''

   Although they've been whipped in each and
every veto showdown with President Bush, congressional Democrats
are showing no inclination to stay down on the mat for the 10-count.
   As the Senate sustained Bush's veto of bill to authorize $2
billion for Amtrak rail passenger service, the House set up a veto
fight with the White House over how much federal workers can
participate in political campaigns.
   By an overwhelming 334-87 vote, the House on Tuesday rebuffed
the administration's latest veto threat and sent Bush a bill to
allow federal workers to take an active role in partisan politics
for the first time in more than half a century.
   Ninety, or more than half of the House's 176 Republicans,
including GOP Leader Robert Michel of Illinois, bolted from the
administration in joining with 244 Democrats to approve the changes
in the 1939 Hatch Act.
   The Senate passed the same bill by a potentially veto-overriding
67-30 vote last month. But GOP leaders there have expressed
confidence they can persuade enough colleagues to change votes to
sustain a veto.
   To win a veto fight, Bush must garner more than a third of the
votes in either the House or Senate, as he did Tuesday with 36 of
the Senate's 100 members voted to sustain his veto of the Amtrak
bill.
   In an effort to avoid another veto fight over the Hatch law,
which outlaws most political activities for 3 million civil service
and postal workers, House leaders agreed to accept a Senate version
less onerous to the administration but still opposed by top
administration aides.
   Many supporters of the changes had expressed a willingness to
yield even further _ such as maintaining the current prohibitions
for employees of intelligence agencies _ if the administration
would only negotiate with them.
   But Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a letter Tuesday
that he and other senior advisers to Bush oppose any change in the
51-year-old Hatch law and would recommend that the president veto
the bill.
   ``Such a reversal in the role of partisan politics in the ethic
of public service would permit virtually unbridled partisan
activities by federal employees,'' Thornburgh wrote.
   Unlike the original House bill last year, the measure that
Congress is sending to Bush retains current prohibitions against
federal workers running for partisan office or soliciting campaign
funds from the public.
   If enacted, government employees could begin holding office in
local, state and national political party organizations for the
first time and solicit campaign funds from co-workers on behalf of
federal employee union political action committees, but only when
not working.
   The original House version approved by an overwhelming 297-90
vote in April 1989 would have allowed government workers to take
leaves of absence to run for partisan office and solicit campaign
funds from anyone.
   ``We are not advocating the grey masses ... rising up in a
coup,'' said Rep. William Ford, D-Mich., a sponsor of the bill.
``We're only asking for the simple right to put up a yard sign,
display a bumper sticker, send a check or stuff envelopes.''
   The Hatch law was enacted at the height of the New Deal to
protect a then-emerging professional civil service from being
coerced by political appointees to contribute to or work on behalf
of candidates.
   Opponents of changing the law argued that its protections
against a spoils system are still needed.

<HEAD>New Government Stirring Controversy With Stances on Settlements,
Soviet Jews</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new right-wing government says it will
spend more on Jewish settlements in the occupied lands and won't
promise not to settle Soviet Jews there, positions bound to set it
on a collision course with Washington.
   Also Tuesday, a member of the Cabinet's defense committee said
Israel should deport the leaders of the 30-month-old Palestinian
uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Washington opposes both deportations and Jewish settlement in
lands captured from Arab countries in the 1967 Middle East war. It
also has urged Israel to show restraint in dealing with the
uprising.
   In the latest uprising-related violence, Israeli troops pursuing
Palestinian stone-throwers fired tear gas into a U.N. clinic in
Gaza City Tuesday, and 66 infants and toddlers were treated for
inhaling the fumes, the army said.
   In Jerusalem, a 17-year-old Jewish seminary student going to
prayers at the Western Wall was stabbed twice in the stomach. He
was reported in fair condition at a Jerusalem hospital.
   On the new government's first working day, it was criticized by
Israeli newspapers across the political spectrum, as well as by
Arab leaders.
   The coalition is made up of 10 rightist and religious factions
and led by the Likud bloc of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
Parliament approved the government on Monday.
   The independent Haaretz daily wrote that Shamir's proposed
polices ``will only worsen Israel's international isolation.'' The
left-leaning Al Hamishar said they would ``cause further incitement
among the Palestinian population.''
   The conservative Maariv daily wrote that ``no government in the
country's history was born of greater sin than the present one.''
   Shamir's coalition was built with the help of defectors lured by
promises of Cabinet posts and money.
   In Cairo, the Egyptian government said in a statement that
Israel has apparently begun ``to prepare for aggression and war.''
   Official Cairo Radio said President Hosni Mubarak telephoned
President Bush to discuss developments in the Middle East, but gave
no further details. Egypt is the only Arab state to have signed a
peace treaty with Israel.
   In Jordan, King Hussein called the new Israeli government a
``dangerous threat.'' And in Syria, Israel's bitter enemy,
President Hafez Assad warned of a new war with the Jewish state and
said such a confrontation would be bloodier than any of the
previous wars.
   Relations between Israel and Washington have been troublesome
since Shamir, prodded by Foreign Minister David Levy and fellow
hard-liner Ariel Sharon, rejected a proposal by Secretary of State
James A. Baker III for preliminary peace talks between Israelis and
Palestinians in Cairo.
   Ties have also been burdened by the stepped-up settlement
activity fostered by Shamir's outgoing caretaker government,
despite sharp objections from President Bush.
   The Bush administration has demanded a halt to all settlements
and specifically called for assurances that Israel not settle
Soviet Jewish immigrants in the occupied lands.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has also hinted he might
slow Jewish emigration unless Israel promises not to settle Soviet
Jews in the occupied lands.
   More than 51,000 Soviet Jews have arrived since last year, and
about 3,700 of them have settled in the West Bank and
Israeli-annexed Arab east Jerusalem, which were seized in the 1967
Middle East war along with the Gaza Strip.
   Sharon rejected the superpower demands Tuesday, saying Israel
was a democracy and could not tell its citizens where to live.
   ``I don't think Israel has to make any declarations. Israel
doesn't need any document of honesty,'' he said after taking office
as housing minister and head of the ministerial committee on
immigration.
   Levy, a hard-line Likud member and a key campaigner against U.S.
Middle East peace proposals, said Tuesday that he would try to
patch up strained relations with Washington, but he did not
elaborate.
   Also, the director general of the Interior Ministry, Dov Kehat,
met with Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip and promised his office
would allocate more money to expand the settlements.
   Ministry spokeswoman Tova Eilinson said the money would go
toward improving the infrastructure in Gush Katif area, comprising
15 settlements for 3,500 people along the Mediterranean coast.
   Agriculture Minister Rafi Eitan, a member of the Cabinet's
defense committee, told army radio that more Palestinians should be
deported.
   ``I have said many times that the punishment of deportations is
the most effective and most humane,'' he said. ``Instead of
shooting at children, you have to deport those responsible, the
inciters, the organizers.''
   Israel has deported 60 Palestinians since the start of the
uprising, drawing sharp criticism from the United States, which
says the practice violates international human rights conventions.
   Since the rebellion began, 717 Palestinians have been killed by
Israeli soldiers or civilians, and 45 Israelis have also died in
the violence.
   Eitan, a member of the ultra-rightist Tzomet faction, is a
former chief of staff who led Israel's forces in the 1982 invasion
of Lebanon.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Differences Just Semantics, Bush Assures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Is the Cold War over? Mikhail Gorbachev and
Ronald Reagan say yes. George Bush suggests no. A difference of
opinion? More like a ``difference of semantics,'' says Bush.
   Humpty Dumpty, in Lewis Carroll's ``Through the Looking Glass,''
tells Alice, ``When I use a word ... it means just what I choose it
to mean, neither more nor less.''
   Dumpty would fit right in as a speechwriter at the Bush White
House, where words often mean only what the president wants them to
convey. If they mean more or less to somebody else, he might
dismiss the discrepancy as a matter of semantics.
   ``I see this glass not half empty, but half full and more,''
Bush said recently of U.S.-Soviet differences.
   Phrases like ``and more'' send aides scurrying to interpret,
embellish, and put an official White House spin on the presidential
remarks.
   So is the Cold War over or not?
   Gorbachev proclaimed after last week's superpower summit that
the Cold War was indeed over. Even former President Reagan, who
once referred to the Soviet Union as the ``evil empire,'' appeared
to agree.
   In an Op-Ed page column in The New York Times earlier this week,
Reagan wrote: ``Let us assume the Cold War is over, although that,
in itself, does not mean we can afford to dismantle our defenses.''
   Bush, however, was not willing to go even that far. He told a
political audience in Des Moines, Iowa, that agreements reached at
his summit with Gorbachev could lead to ``the beginning of the end
of the Cold War.''
   Does that mean that Bush thinks the Cold War is still being
fought? And do he and Gorbachev disagree on so central an issue to
U.S.-Soviet relations?
   ``I don't know,'' the president said. ``We've got a difference
of semantics, don't we?''
   Bush would not be pinned down on whether he thought the Cold War
was over. For his own reasons, he was not joining Gorbachev and
Reagan in their more upbeat assessments.
   ``We've got to wait and see how we can resolve all these
problems out here,'' he continued. ``There are plenty of them
around.''
   Just what did Bush mean, a reporter asked recently, when he
suggested that Gorbachev had shown ``willingness'' to peacefully
resolve the Lithuanian crisis while saying officials of the
rebellious Baltic republic had only shown ``some willingness to
compromise?''
   ``You're presenting me with some semantic difference that I did
not intend to make,'' the president replied.
   In cases involving sensitive policy issues, Bush often chooses
his words very carefully _ despite his reputation for fractured
syntax _ either to clarify or obscure his meaning.
   Thus, the candidate who told Americans to ``read my lips: no new
taxes'' was able to convene a budget summit with Congress by
promising ``no preconditions.''
   Surely that meant the administration was signaling it would
consider tax increases. Or did it?
   Bush never did say, even though he once scolded: ``Read all the
tea leaves. Listen to the nuances. It's out there very clearly.''
   It was a matter of semantics, too, that enabled the president to
defend his decision to send national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft on a secret mission to China despite his own ban on
``high-level exchanges.''
   Scowcroft's visit soon after the Tiananmen Square massacre that
produced the ban was not an ``exchange;'' it was a ``contact'' and
thus not covered by the edict, Bush said when the mission was
disclosed last year.
   The president also redefines almost daily his rule against
answering questions at ``photo opportunities.''
   Bush cites his rule as grounds for ignoring questions shouted at
him by reporters _ except when he wants to answer a question. Then
he modifies the rule, recasts it or totally ignores it.
   On Tuesday, Bush added a new twist.
   ``No answers _ only those wearing hats get their question
answered,'' he announced. It was his 66th birthday and some
reporters wore children's party hats to a picture-taking session
between Bush and congressional leaders.
   In the wonderland of presidential semantics, it's often up to
chief White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater to bridge the gap
between what is said and what is meant.
   For instance, on Monday, he was asked whether Bush was near a
decision on cutting off talks with the Palestine Liberation
Organization to protest the May 30 attack by Palestinian guerrillas
on an Israeli beach.
   The president had ``no timetable'' for such a decision,
Fitzwater said.
   But moments earlier, Vice President Dan Quayle had condemned the
PLO and had told an audience of Jewish leaders that Bush would make
the ``right decision'' and make it ``soon.''
   ``Soon is totally consistent with no timetable,'' Fitzwater
deadpanned.

<HEAD>Poll Shows 49 Percent Believe Incurably Ill Have Right To Take Own
Life</HEAD>

   About half the American people believe the
incurably ill and those hopelessly wracked with pain have a moral
right to commit suicide, according to a survey described as
relevant to ``suicide doctor'' Jack Kevorkian's case.
   But an expert on the legal aspects of medical ethics says
patients have ``absolutely no right'' to demand that a physician
assist them in ending their lives.
   `` `Thou shalt not kill' still stands in this society,
especially for doctors,'' Susan M. Wolf, a lawyer with the Hastings
Center, a research institute that studies medical ethics, said in a
telephone interview from Briaircliff Manor, N.Y..
   The poll, conducted for the Times Mirror Center for The People
and the Press, showed that 49 percent of the public believe a
person with an incurable disease has a moral right to commit
suicide. It said 55 percent believe in such a right for people
suffering great pain with no hope of improvement.
   The telephone poll of 1,213 adults was conducted during the
first week in May, about a month before Kevorkian touched off a
furor by assisting in the suicide of a 54-year-old woman who had
been diagnosed as being in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.
   Diane Colasanto, a researcher for the Times Mirror Center, said
the survey did not include any questions about physician-assisted
suicide, but added, ``I think what we found is relevant to the
Kevorkian case.''
   Kevorkian, a retired pathologist in Pontiac, Mich., created an
intravenous device that he hooked up to Janet Adkins of Portland,
Ore., at her request. It allowed Mrs. Adkins to press a button that
fed coma- and death-inducing drugs into her bloodstream.
   Kevorkian has not been charged, and prosecutors say it may take
up to two months to get results of toxicological studies of the
dead woman's brain to determine whether the Alzheimer's diagnosis
was correct. In the meantime, Circuit Judge Alice Gilbert has
ordered him to stop using his suicide machine and to refrain from
doing anything else to help patients take their own lives.
   ``The Kevorkian case has demonstrated that there still is a lot
of confusion among three very different things, one being the right
of a patient to commit suicide,'' Ms. Wolf said.
   This question, she said, is distinct from ``whether a physician
should be authorized to assist'' in a suicide and from ``the
completely separate question of whether treatment should be
terminated at the patient's request.''
   The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the latter issue soon
in the case of Nancy Cruzan, 31, of Carterville, Mo., who suffered
severe brain damage in a 1983 automobile accident. Her parents, Joe
and Joyce Cruzan, want doctors to remove a feeding tube from her
stomach.
   ``The feeding tube removal presented by the Cruzan case has
caused a lot of controversy in part because ... when you pull a
feeding tube it is foreseeable often that the patient will indeed
die,'' said Ms. Wolf.
   However, she said, ``When a clinician honors a patient's request
to be free of an unwanted treatment, he is essentially letting
nature take its course.''
   ``There is a long history with ancient roots to the notion that
people are entitled to be free of unwanted bodily invasion,'' she
said. ``On the other hand people have absolutely no right to demand
that a clinician assist them in suicide.''
   The Times Mirror poll showed that eight of 10 Americans think
patients should be allowed to die in some circumstances. Eight in
10 also approved of state laws allowing medical treatment for a
terminally ill patient to be withdrawn or withheld if that is what
the patient wishes.
   The poll was conducted May 1-5. The Times Mirror center, an arm
of the Times Mirror publishing and broadcasting organization, said
it was subject to a possible error of three percentage points
either way because of sampling and other random effects.

<HEAD>Report: U.S. Lags in Development of High-Definition TV</HEAD>

   The United States could be damaging its world
position in high technology by falling behind in development of
high-definition television, congressmen say.
   ``The message is clear: Congress and the administration, get
moving,'' said Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif. ``We must recognize the
huge significance of HDTV to our economy.''
   A report issued Tuesday by the Office of Technology Assessment,
a research arm of Congress, said the United States lags behind
Japan in development of HDTV. ``Japan considers HDTV to be an
important step into the future information society,'' it said.
   High-definition television promises motion picture-quality
images and compact disc-quality sound. Proponents say its
development could help re-energize the U.S. electronics and
computer industries.
   New consumer electronics have long spurred advances in other
fields, such as data storage and defense industries, said Levine
and Reps. George Brown, D-Calif., and Don Ritter, R-Pa.
   Little work has been done in the United States on developing
HDTV, the report said. Zenith is the only U.S.-owned company that
still manufactures television sets.
   But the Japanese have been selling studio equipment for
high-definition television since 1984 and are gearing up for
large-scale production of HDTV sets for consumers, the report said.
   ``The little work done on HDTV in the United States has largely
been by or for foreign-owned consumer electronics firms or by
small, underfunded university programs and entrepreneurs,'' it said.
   A Pentagon agency charged with HDTV development, the
High-Resolution Systems Task Force, received $10 million this year
for advanced TV research. The task force wants $100 million a year.
   Brown, who requested the report, said at a news conference, ``We
cannot afford to be left behind'' in HDTV development and the other
technologies it can aid.
   ``By our refusing to mount a national HDTV effort we are
assuring ourselves a dangerously diminished global economic
position,'' Levine said.
   Ritter said he believed the Bush administration was starting to
do ``a lot more listening'' to calls that it get behind HDTV
development.
   The Federal Communications Commission has received a number of
proposals by companies to set the national standard for HDTV
broadcasts. The systems are to be tested for 12 to 18 months before
the government chooses the standard in 1993.
   No one knows how well high-definition TVs would sell in the
United States, the OTA report said, but the potential market value
is large.
   The Electronic Industries Association estimates the market could
total $12 billion a year, in 1988 dollars, by 2003 _ $4 billion
more than the market would be for standard TV sets.
   Commercial and industrial uses also could be important, OTA
said. Manufacturing technologies developed for HDTV would aid
producers of computers and telecommunications equipment, it said.
   The government also would benefit, the report said, noting that
the Federal Aviation Administration already has contracted with the
Sony Corp. to buy high-resolution display screens to monitor air
traffic.

<HEAD>Bumper Harvest Expected to Replenish Low Wheat Inventory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's shrunken wheat inventory is
expected to increase sharply as farmers move into a bumper harvest,
according to the latest Agriculture Department forecasts.
   But the important 1990 corn crop is still being planted and it
will be a couple of months before firm yield estimates are ready.
   Winter wheat production was estimated Tuesday at a nine-year
high of 2.09 billion bushels. That was down fractionally from the
May forecast, but still 44 percent more than last year's
drought-battered harvest of 1.45 billion bushels.
   Figures released by the department's Agricultural Statistics
Board showed the decline from the May forecast was only about 0.1
percent, or less than 2.4 million bushels.
   The average yield, based on indications as of June 1, was
estimated at 41.2 bushels per acre, compared with 41.1 bushels
indicated last month and the 1989 yield of 35.1 bushels.
   Farmers are expected to harvest fewer than 50.7 million acres,
down from 50.8 million indicated in May.
   ``Wet conditions have caused yield declines in the (Mississippi)
Delta area,'' the report said. ``Early harvested fields in Arkansas
had low test weights, and diseases are a problem.''
   The Missouri crop is developing late, with about 23 percent
``turning color'' in the ripening process as of June 3,
approximately 10 days behind the usual pace, the report said.
   In Kansas, winter wheat production was estimated at 460.2
million bushels, unchanged from the May forecast and more than
double the shriveled 1989 harvest of 213.6 million bushels.
   Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the next year.
It accounts for about three-fourths of the U.S. total wheat
production. The remainder is planted in the spring.
   The USDA's first official estimate of 1990 production of all
wheat will be issued July 12. The first estimates for corn,
soybeans and some other major spring-planted crops are scheduled
for Aug. 9, along with revised figures for wheat.
   No official estimates of total 1990 wheat output based on field
surveys were included.
   However, department analysts in a related report did project
``highly tentative'' 1990 production of all wheat at almost 2.69
billion bushels, up from fewer than 2.04 billion bushels last year
and virtually unchanged from the May projection.
   Projections for all wheat and some other crops were based on
yield trends and an assumption the crop would have normal weather
the remainder of the growing season.
   The 1990 corn harvest was projected at 8.1 billion bushels, up
from 7.53 billion harvested last year and unchanged from May.
Soybean production was projected at 1.925 billion bushels, also
unchanged from last month and virtually the same as the crop of
1.927 billion bushels in 1989.
   According to the supply-and-demand report, the U.S. wheat
stockpile was drained to a 15-year low of 452 million bushels on
June 1, the beginning of the new wheat marketing year. But with the
expected larger 1990 harvest, the wheat stockpile could be rebuilt
to about 772 million bushels a year from now.
   The projected larger 1990 wheat harvest is putting pressure on
market prices, which were indicated in both May and June in the
range of $2.90 to $3.30 per bushel in 1990-91, compared with an
estimated $3.71 last season.
   If corn production turns out at the projected level of 8.1
billion bushels, it still wouldn't be quite enough to match
domestic and export demand, the report showed. Thus, the U.S. corn
stockpile, which may be around 1.28 billion bushels next fall,
could edge lower by Oct. 1, 1991.
   Corn prices were projected at $2.35 to $2.75 per bushel in
1990-91, compared with the current season's forecast of $2.35 to
$2.40 per bushel. That was up 10 cents per bushel from last month's
1990-91 projection.
   Soybeans were indicated at an average of $6.25 per bushel in the
1990-91 marketing year that begins Sept. 1, compared with $5.70
this season. That was unchanged from May.
   Other June crop estimates included:
   _Oranges, 184 million boxes, up 3 percent from May prospects but
down 12 percent from last season.
   _Peach production, including California clingstones, 2.13
billion pounds, down 9 percent from last year. The California
clingstone crop, at 1 billion pounds, is up 1 percent from 1989.
   _Barlett pear production in the Pacific Coast states, 545,000
tons, up 4 percent from last year.
   _Sweet cherry production in the Western states, 131,000 tons,
down 22 percent from last year.
   _Almond output, a record 670 million pounds, up 37 percent from
last year.
   _Spring potato production, 23.8 million hundredweight, up 14
percent from the 1989 harvest.

   With better reporting systems, international
health experts have a clearer view of the AIDS epidemic as it
spreads around the world, but they don't like what they're seeing
in developing countries.
   ``The global balance of HIV infection is rapidly tipping toward
the developing countries,'' said Michael Merson, director of the
World Health Organization Global Program on AIDS.
   These countries currently account for about half of the 6
million to 8 million people worldwide infected with the
AIDS-causing human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. By the end of
the decade their share will probably increase to 70 percent to 80
percent, and possibly to 90 percent in 2010, according to figures
WHO released Tuesday.
   ``What's going to happen in this decade is that AIDS will
continue to increase in Africa, primarily in countries that don't
have large rates of infection now,'' Merson said in an interview.
   ``In addition, we're starting to see considerable increases in
Asian countries and South American countries, and also in the
Caribbean.''
   Part of the reason for the faster-than-expected spread of HIV in
these countries is that the limited data available previously made
accurate predictions difficult and better reporting systems are now
in place, said Dr. David Brandling-Bennett of the Pan
American-World Health Organization.
   However, officials have documented an alarming increase in HIV
infection in Thailand, and are unsure why it is spreading so
quickly, he said.
   In that Asian country, the number of people who have been
infected and their cases reported to authorities rose from about
1,000 in 1987 to 50,000 currently, Merson said. He added that only
about one-third of actual cases get reported.
   Among prostitutes in Thailand, fewer than 1 percent were
reported with HIV infection in 1987. Now, the rate is as high as 40
percent in some cities, Merson said.
   WHO had been projecting that by the end of the decade, 15
million to 20 million people worldwide will have been infected with
HIV, but officials now say that is a minimum estimate.
   The forecast is expected to be pushed up by the startling
increase of AIDS in the developing countries as well as by an
increase in heterosexual transmission of the disease in
industrialized countries.
   New projections will not be ready until late this year or 1991,
Merson said. He declined to estimate how high the projection could
go.
   The virus is spread mainly by sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood and blood products,
and by pregnant women to their babies.
   In the United States, most of the people with AIDS have been
homosexual men and intravenous drug users.
   However, Merson said that in industrialized countries _ such as
the United States _ with inner-city poverty and high rates of
intravenous drug use and sexually transmitted diseases,
heterosexual transmission is increasing.
   About 60 percent of HIV infections worldwide have resulted from
heterosexual intercourse, but by the turn of the century, that
proportion is expected to rise as high as 80 percent, Merson said.
   In Africa, the virus is being spread primarily through
heterosexual intercourse, and as many women are infected as men. An
estimated 3.5 million sub-Saharan Africans have been infected with
the virus, accounting for more than half the global total of HIV
infection.
   Since the first AIDS cases were reported in 1981, more than
250,000 have been reported to WHO from more than 150 countries, but
because of under-reporting and delays in reporting, agency
officials believe that number is closer to 700,000.
   That number is expected to grow to about 5.5 million by the end
of the decade.
   As of April 30, AIDS had been diagnosed in 132,510 Americans, of
whom 61 percent, or 80,798, have died since June 1, 1981, according
to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.

<TEXT>
   The nation's largest manufacturer of
over-the-counter menstrual relief medicine must pay $375,000 to
settle charges that it made unsubstantiated advertising claims.
   Sterling Drug Inc. reached agreement on Tuesday with the Federal
Trade Commission concerning a 1985 complaint that eventually
encompassed advertising for all but one of the company's products.
   The agreement ``is without admission of any wrongdoing,'' said
Terry Kelley, spokesman for Sterling Drug Inc., which makes Midol
brand products.
   We entered into the consent decree ``to avoid protracted, costly
litigation.''
   A court battle would have involved ``highly technical scientific
issues,'' said Kelley, noting that the agreement ``does not involve
our current advertising.''
   ``Sterling will continue to manufacture and market the Midol
brand products,'' he said, adding that all the questionable ads
were halted by March.
   The FTC said Sterling had violated a 1985 order prohibiting
product performance claims unless a company has ``competent and
reliable evidence for those claims.''
   The complaint said Sterling ran certain ads for ``Original
Formula Midol'' and ``Maximum Strength Midol for Cramps'' from
March 1985 to January 1986 and in April 1988 that claimed or
implied one of the ingredients was a muscle relaxant for menstrual
cramps that would quickly help relieve muscle contractions.
   ``The ingredient in question has been removed from the
product,'' according to Sterling.
   Also cited were ads for ``Maximum Strength Midol PMS'' which
claimed ``total'' or ``complete relief'' for the symptoms of
premenstrual syndrome.
   The FTC also said the company had no scientific evidence that
``Original Midol Muti-Symptom Formula'' and ``Maximum Strength
Midol Multi-Symptom Formula'' relieved menstrual water-weight gain.
   Advertising for Sterling's Midol 200 was not included in the
complaint.
   Sterling is based in New York City and is a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Eastman Kodak Co.

   Record store managers pulled an album by the
rap group 2 Live Crew from their shelves after police warned they
risked arrest for obscenity.
   Detectives set out Tuesday to notify 84 stores that the lyrics
of the 1.7 million-selling album ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' are
obscene, said vice squad commander Lt. Jerry Pittman.
   The action extends what had been a Florida-based campaign by
anti-pornography crusaders upset by the album's references to sex
acts and genitals. A federal judge in Florida last week declared
the record obscene.
   Texas law requires that a defendant be aware material is obscene
to be convicted of selling it, Pittman said. The maximum penalty is
a year in jail and a $2,000 fine.
   Some record store managers and workers said they were asked by
police to sign a statement saying they had been warned the lyrics
are obscene.
   ``It's censorship, and they're starting it,'' said Greta Colbin,
manager at a Hastings Records and Tapes outlet. ``It's a violation
of our rights.''
   She said stores in her chain don't sell ``R'' rated albums to
anyone under 18.
   Another record store manager agreed with the police action.
   ``I'm not one of the people for censorship, but I think this
music is ridiculous,'' said Mark Christy, branch manager of a Sound
Warehouse.
   Pittman said a Bexar County assistant district attorney, Mike
Schill, reviewed transcripts and listened to the lyrics before
determining some of the words violate the state's obscenity law.
   The prosecutor wrote to Pittman May 29 that he was convinced the
lyrics of ``Put Her In the Buck'' and ``Me So Horney'' were obscene
but that his office would not issue a letter telling merchants to
remove the album.
   ``We believe that such action might be considered `prior
restraint' and unconstitutional by the appellate courts,'' Schill
wrote.
   Police Chief William O. Gibson said removal of the records was
voluntary, but that the district attorney's office has agreed to
prosecute cases resulting from complaints by local anti-pornography
groups. Schill said he would evaluate each case police bring him
for prosecution.
   The Texas state courts would not be bound by the federal judge's
ruling, which the rap group's attorney appealed Monday. In Florida,
two members of the band were arrested on obscenity charges after
performing material from the album, and a record store owner was
arrested for selling the album.

<HEAD>Plans to Curb Assault Weapons Move Forward A Notch</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Semiautomatic assault weapons made in the
United States would be subject to the curbs already applying to the
imported variety under a bill approved by the House Judiciary
Committee.
   ``These are lethal weapons regardless of the country of
origin,'' Rep. William J. Hughes, D-N.J., said Tuesday as the panel
approved the bill, 21-15.
   The measure would require the Treasury secretary to issue a list
of weapons that could not be sold because they lacked a ``sporting
purpose.''
   The bill also would ban magazines and other ammunition-feeding
devices with a capacity of more than seven rounds, bar the
manufacture of firearms to which silencers or bayonets could be
directly attached and halt the export of assault weapons to
governments that violate human rights or aid terrorists.
   People who already owned such weapons would be able to keep
them. But the bill calls for fresh regulations governing their
transfer to new owners. Manufacturers could still produce them for
the military.
   The bill would double from five to 10 years the mandatory
minimum penalty for using or carrying an assault weapon in a
violent crime or drug-related crime.
   Opponents said the bill would not cut down on crime much because
the weapons of choice among criminals are mainly shotguns and
.38-caliber pistols.
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., said that in some cases the
statistics concerning assault weapons ``have been construed in a
somewhat misleading fashion,'' making it appear they are the
primary firearms of criminals.
   Supporters, however, pointed to multiple slayings in Stockton,
Calif., and Louisville over the last 18 months by criminals armed
with semiautomatic assault rifles.
   McCollum noted statements by authorities that there is ``no
functional difference'' between traditional semiautomatic hunting
rifles with their brown wooden stocks and military-style variants.
   Committee Chairman Jack Brooks, D-Texas, backed a McCollum
amendment that would have made gun collecting and the ``plinking''
of tin cans and the like part of the definition of ``sporting
purpose.''
   Brooks said McCollum's amendment would ``give bureaucratic
regulators a little more guidance'' about what Congress had in mind.
   But the proposal was rejected 20-16, with Hughes saying that
``my colleague from Florida, who I love dearly, is going to be
considered a legislative grim reaper because he once again offers
an amendment that would gut the bill.''
   In the Senate, sponsors of an omnibus crime bill containing
restrictions on nine semiautomatic assault weapons searched for a
way to salvage the measure, which was withdrawn from the floor last
week after lawmakers balked at cutting short a threatened
filibuster.
   Senate Judiciary Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., fielded
questions about the bill at a meeting of Democrats, aides said. But
they said he also had to prepare for committee action in the wake
of a Supreme Court decision throwing out the nation's law against
flag burning.

   The East German prime minister is warning his
countrymen against going on a shopping spree in their tender
economy when they begin to enjoy the West German mark instead of
their nearly worthless currency.
   ``They'll use the new money in the summer months to travel where
they haven't been able to travel,'' Prime Minister Lothar de
Maiziere told the National Press Club on Tuesday.
   ``I hope their eagerness to buy will hold itself within bounds,
because otherwise there would be serious difficulties for the
economy,'' he added.
   De Maiziere addressed the club on his first trip to the United
States, which may be his last as the formerly communist East
Germany hurtles toward reunification in three weeks with West
Germany, whose economy is quite healthy.
   He said unity would be costly to West Germany in the short run
but that over a longer period it would bring an economic boom _
especially if West Germans invest in East Germany instead of just
marketing their goods there.
   If West Germany saw its eastern neighbor only as new customers,
it would lead to great social tensions and reproaches, he added.
   On July 2, the nearly worthless East German mark will be
replaced by highly valuable West German marks. The exchange rate
will be one-for-one. Under communism, East German black marketeers
were willing to pay seven, or even 10, to one.
   Klaus Friedrich, former head of German affairs at the Federal
Reserve, predicted that East Germany will achieve West German
living standards in 10 years as a result of unification.
   Friedrich, now with the Institute of International Finance, also
foresaw East German unemployment skyrocketing from 1 percent to 11
percent by the end of the year, robbing 1 million people of their
jobs. He also predicted many formerly state-run factories, unable
to compete in a capitalist marketplace, would close.
   But in a speech to the National Economists Club, Friedrich said
German prices would remain fairly stable.
   ``I think that inflation, which currently runs between 2 and 3
percent in West Germany, will not be the dire consequence
predicted,'' he said.
   ``Even if it doubles, which is unlikely, it will still be within
a tolerable range.''
   Generous West German social security benefits, to be granted to
East Germans, are expected to cushion the effect of unemployment.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney says significant
cuts in President Bush's 1991 defense budget could force him to
discharge more than 100,000 military personnel than already planned.
   Facing growing congressional opposition to Bush's $303.3 billion
defense spending plan, Cheney told a Senate panel Tuesday that
proposed reductions of more than $8 billion would cause ``great
violence to our most important military asset _ our men and women.''
   He estimated that if Congress adopts budget totals passed by the
House on May 1, he would be forced to discharge 140,000 of the 2.1
million men and women now in uniform, about 103,000 more than in
the current defense plan.
   ``The only place we can get those kinds of savings quickly in
fiscal 1991 is our manpower,'' Cheney said. ``There's no other
place to go. We'd have to run a lot of people off, throw people on
the street, freeze promotions.''
   White House officials and members of Congress are negotiating an
overall budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 that would
determine the amount of money for defense.
   The House approved a $1.2 trillion budget that earmarks $295.5
billion for defense _ $8.3 billion less than Bush has proposed. The
Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan to cut his request by
$9.4 billion.
   Cheney promised negotiators last week that by Thursday he would
submit armed forces personnel projections for the next five years
if defense spending is cut by 25 percent.
   The Pentagon chief provided a hint of the impact on Tuesday in
testimony before the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on defense.
   Cheney said a 25 percent cut would result in a reduction of five
to six Army divisions and five to six wings from the Air Force.
   Deputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood, meantime, directed
Pentagon personnel chief Christopher Jehn to coordinate a study on
reducing the size of the officer corps in the 1990s in anticipation
of a ``smaller force structure in light of changing world
conditions and declining budgets.
   During the hearing, senators challenged Cheney's plan to buy 75
B-2 stealth bombers, which according to latest estimates could cost
$860 million each.
   ``My view is that we probably ought to scrap the B-2 or just buy
the B-2s in production,'' said Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.
   Bumpers questioned whether the Soviets would be able to detect
the radar-evading bomber if they develop a counterpart to the
sophisticated Aegis radar that the United States has in its naval
fleet.
   Cheney said the Air Force has not tested the B-2 against Aegis
radar and that low observability testing of the bomber is scheduled
to begin this fall. ``I'm confident the B-2 can do the mission that
it's intended to do, but there's still a lot of testing to do,'' he
said.
   Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office said that based on
its inflation assumptions, the overall B-2 program of 75 planes
would cost $64.9 billion _ more than Cheney's estimate of $61.1
billion and the Air Force's recent total of about $62 billion.
   The CBO figures that increase the cost of a single bomber from
$815 million to about $860 million were included in a letter to
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., a B-2 opponent.
   The Union of Concerned Scientists and members of Congress on
Tuesday kicked off a nationwide advertising campaign to end
production of the B-2 bomber at the 15 currently in the pipeline.
It called the bomber ``a mistake were cannot afford.''

<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The crackdown on ribald rappers 2
Live Crew is part of a morals wave breaking across Florida's land
of sand, sun and fun.
   ``It's a rising tide that is becoming increasingly difficult to
contain,'' said Robyn Blumner, executive director of the American
Civil Liberties Union in Florida.
   Those supporting the crackdown argue that a tide of bawdy
activity needed containment. Among the targets of their wrath:
cheeky thong swimsuits, X-rated videos, nude bars and TV
advertising for phone-sex services.
   U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez ruled here June 6 that the rap
album ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' is obscene. That was followed
by the arrest two days later of a record shop owner who sold the
album and the arrests in the wee hours Sunday of two 2 Live Crew
members for performing songs from the record in concert.
   The crackdown has been attributed to politics, the influence of
retirees and the increasing muscle of conservative groups. It has
taken place mainly in tourist-driven beach areas associated with
risque entertainment:
   _Gonzalez's ruling, which called the album with its graphic
sexual content a violation of community standards in Dade, Broward
and Palm Beach counties, followed similar rulings by a local judge
and grand juries in five counties.
   _In a four-county area that includes Daytona Beach, two video
store owners were arrested and X-rated videos disappeared from most
shops after 100 store owners were warned by State Attorney John
Tanner against tapes deemed obscene.
   _In Sarasota, where charges earlier were dropped against a
19-year-old clerk accused of selling the 2 Live Crew album to a
girl not yet in her teens, thong bikinis _ which have only a narrow
piece of material covering the buttocks _ were banned. The state
Cabinet on Tuesday approved a rule that swimsuits at state parks
must cover at least half of a woman's breasts and everyone's
buttocks.
   _In the Fort Lauderdale area, bars featuring nude dancing were
banned last year unless they serve only non-alcoholic drinks.
   _In Palm Beach County, commissioner Ron Howard is seeking a ban
on TV advertising for 900-number ``phone sex'' operations, in which
callers are charged $10 or more to hear a woman talk dirty to them.
   Gonzalez called the 2 Live Crew case part of the continuing
confrontation between anything goes and enough is enough.
   ``And anybody who lives in the land of `Miami Vice' as I do
knows that just about anything goes down here,'' John Thompson, a
Coral Gables lawyer who helped lead the fight against 2 Live Crew,
said Monday on ABC's ``Nightline.''
   But the days of ``anything goes'' appear to be going.
   ``I haven't seen anything like it down here. It reminds me of
the McCarthy era. It shows that small minds aren't limited to small
towns,'' said Woody Graber, a Miami Beach publicist who represents
the Gold Club, an adult entertainment lounge that had to close
because of restrictions such as requiring covering of nipples. It
is operating now in compliance with the law.
   In not-too-distant days, Florida's beach areas were better known
for wet T-shirt contests, spring break revelry and showings of
porno flicks such as ``Deep Throat.''
   But first Fort Lauderdale three years ago, and then Daytona
Beach this year, toughened spring break standards, making arrest
sweeps against drugs, drunkenness and lewd behavior.
   Ms. Blumner of the ACLU said such conservative organizations as
the American Family Association have become well-organized in
Florida in recent years. Ann Brittain, a University of Miami
anthropology professor, noted that retirees make up nearly a fifth
of Florida's 12 million residents.
   When they were raising their families, she said, they didn't
want their children to watch Elvis Presley's undulating pelvis or
listen to the Rolling Stones implore ``Let's Spend The Night
Together.'' They may be shocked to hear of 2 Live Crew's raunchy
lyrics, she said.
   ``The ones born in the 1905-1920 era, they see a L'eggs
commercial, they get a little nervous,'' said Barry Freilich of
Ormond Beach, a video store owner Tanner has charged with obscenity.
   Serial killer Ted Bundy, executed in Florida's electric chair in
1989, figures in some of the anti-pornography campaigning.
   Tanner, a born-again Christian, prayed with Bundy on death row
and recounts that Bundy partly blamed his rape-murder rampage on
hard-core pornography. Bundy discussed the effects of hard-core
porn in his final interview, with radio psychologist James Dobson.
   Dobson's group, Focus on the Family, led Thompson to go after 2
Live Crew after Focus on the Family sent out transcripts of the
album's lyrics.
   Blumner said Bundy is a pawn for the anti-porn groups. ``The
fact of the matter is there are more sicko murderers who say God
told them to kill than those who read Playboy,'' she said.
   She blames politics for the Florida push.
   Republican Gov. Bob Martinez, facing a tough re-election battle,
spoke out early against 2 Live Crew. Broward County Sheriff Nick
Navarro, who ordered the 2 Live Crew arrests, has been accused by 2
Live Crew attorney Bruce Rogow and others of overzealousness.
   Civil liberties-minded politicians may find it hard to rush to
the defense in such cases, Ms. Blumner said.
   ``They're hard issues for politicians to deal with in a
constitutional way because the other side has commandeered the term
pro-family,'' she said. ``They're easy issues for politicians who
don't care about free expression rights.''
   The governor defended his position this week, saying the 2 Live
Crew album is ``audio pornography.''
   ``Communities have the right to set a standard,'' Martinez said.

<HEAD>City Employee who Prays for Mayor is Prospective Juror in Barry
Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A city employee who says she prays for Mayor
Marion Barry is one of the prospective jurors at his cocaine and
perjury trial.
   The woman was sent into the pool of 68 potential jurors Tuesday,
along with nine other people.
   Meanwhile, top Barry aides said he would announce he was
abandoning his re-election campaign plans.
   ``He will do it, but the only question left is when,'' one top
Barry adviser said on condition of anonymity. ``We're all just
waiting.'' .
   Barry told his top advisers and fund-raisers at a meeting Sunday
that he would give up his plans for a fourth, four-year term.
Several aides said the mayor was making that move in hopes of
restarting stalled plea bargain talks in his drug case.
   Opening statements in Barry's trial are planned for early next
week. U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson plans to
seat a jury on Monday.
   The prospective juror who said she has prayed for Barry in his
time of legal troubles works in the District of Columbia's
Department of Human Services.
   She said she didn't know any of the more than 50 potential
witnesses in the case, including former human services department
Director David Rivers.
   The judge said he is unable to conclude the woman was lying
about the witness list. He also said her prayers for the defendant
are not inconsistent with her assurances that she could be a fair
and impartial juror.
   Barry is accused of 10 counts of cocaine possession, one count
of conspiracy and three counts of lying to a federal grand jury
about his alleged involvement with drugs. The three perjury counts
are felonies.

<HEAD>Marine Deserter Ready To Turn Himself In After 21 Years In Canada</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the last 21 years, Ron Jacko has been
afraid to cross the U.S. border. Now the Marine deserter has
returned from Canada to turn himself in.
   Jacko, a native of Cleveland, left his Toronto home on Tuesday.
He said he would present himself at the Marine base in Quantico,
Va., this afternoon.
   Jacko, 42, said he wanted to make peace with himself and be free
to see his mother.
   ``I wasn't able to go home for my father's funeral,'' he said.
``My mother's still alive, I'm an only child and she's about 74
herself right now. She just went through three operations in about
the last six months.
   ``I don't want to be in a similar situation with my mom. I want
to be able to be there.``
   Jacko said he opposed the war from the outset, but decided to
enlist in hopes of fulfilling his duty without going to Vietnam.
   He first tried to join the Navy, but flunked the entrance exam.
The Navy recruiter then referred him to the Marine recruiter.
   The 21-year-old volunteer completed basic training and was
assigned to communications school. That assignment persuaded him he
was likely to be shipped to Vietnam, so while on leave he went
home, said goodbye to his family and headed for Canada.
   ``It was a serious decision. It was a painful decision,'' he
said.
   He's been living for 21 years in Toronto, where he married and
worked as manager of a health food store.
   He said he didn't try to take advantage of amnesty programs
during the Ford and Carter administrations because the first
covered only draft dodgers and the second would have imposed a
stigma and a status of ``clemency discharge.''
   Looking back now, ``I wish I would have taken advantage of that
program,'' Jacko said. Life as a deserter was never carefree, he
said. ``It was eating at me, it was chewing at me.''
   Finally, his mother's failing health persuaded him to turn
himself in and try to tell the Marines that he deserves an
administrative discharge, rather than a court-martial.
   He returned to the United States on Tuesday, and with a lawyer
from the group Citizen Soldier, made the rounds of Washington news
offices. Jacko and his attorney planned to talk today with the
staff of Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, and try to get meetings with
Ohio's two senators before heading for Quantico.
   Oakar said Jacko had not made an appointment but letters from
his attorney arrived Tuesday at her Cleveland and Capitol Hill
offices.
   ``The letter says they want to talk to me. If they come, I want
to talk to them,'' Oakar said.
   Jacko said he hopes attention from Congress and the public will
help his case. ``Hope springs eternal, I guess. And naivete springs
eternal, too.''
   His wife, Nadia, did not accompany Jacko, but he said she would
join him in his new home after his release.

<TEXT>
   FBI agents would have more leeway to shoot at
suspects under a proposed new policy, sources say.
   Agents could shoot fleeing suspects of violent crimes who are
armed and considered likely to commit another crime, said the
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Deadly force also could be used if the agent had a reasonable
belief that the suspect could not be arrested without firing shots.
   Under current policy, FBI agents may use deadly force only in
self-defense or to protect the life of another person.
   The new policy has been under study since 1985, when the Supreme
Court held that police officers could shoot a fleeing, armed
suspect if the officers believed the person posed a threat to
public safety, said the sources.
   The increase in drug-related violence prompted the drafting of
the new policy, said the sources.
   The FBI is awaiting clearance from Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh before making an announcement of the policy change, said
the sources.
   The bureau has also taken steps to replace its standard-issue
.38-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers with a 10mm automatic pistol,
which officials say is in the process of being tested at FBI firing
ranges.
   The new firepower was sought because FBI officials felt agents
were outgunned on the nation's streets, officials say.

   Massachusetts Institute of Technology
trustees vote Monday on their executive committee's choice of
University of Michigan Provost Charles Vest to be the school's
president.
   Vest, a 48-year-old engineer, would replace Paul Gray, who
announced in March 1989 that he wanted to step down, MIT spokesman
Ken Campbell said Tuesday.
   If Vest becomes the school's 15th president, it will end a
yearlong search that frustrated officials at the prestigious
private research university. MIT, founded in 1861, has 9,700
students.
   Initial front-runner John Deutch, then provost of MIT, withdrew
after some faculty members bitterly opposed him. Another candidate,
MIT biologist and Nobel laureate David Baltimore, was snapped up by
Rockefeller University to become its president.
   Finally, Phillip Sharp agreed to take the job in February but
changed his mind a week later, saying he would rather continue his
teaching and cancer research at MIT.
   Vest has been at Michigan since his graduation from West
Virginia University in 1963, except for a stint at Stanford
University in the mid-1970s. He was dean of engineering at Michigan
before becoming provost and vice president for academic affairs
last year.
   ``They've picked a very good man,'' said Walter Harrison,
University of Michigan spokesman. ``He's a very thoughtful,
considerate human being who is a forceful and direct administrator.
He is obviously a very well-known engineer, but he also has a deep
commitment to the arts ... and humanities and social sciences.''
   Harrison described Vest as a man of dry wit and deep interests
that range from classical music to comic books.
   Vest did not return telephone calls to his office in Ann Arbor
on Tuesday.
   The state-supported Michigan school has 50,000 students on three
campuses.

   Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan says ``tough guy
talk'' used by national drug policy director William Bennett in a
verbal attack on New York Gov. Mario Cuomo makes him wish he had
blocked Bennett's confirmation.
   ``I have to say that if a year ago I had any reason to suppose
that Dr. Bennett would use his office in this manner, I would have
taken whatever measures necessary to see that he was not confirmed
for it,'' Moynihan, D-N.Y., said Tuesday in remarks submitted to

   Bennett, in Albany, N.Y., last Thursday to meet with state drug
officials, attacked Cuomo's drug fighting record and challenged the
Democrat to run for president.
   ``Nobody's afraid of this guy,'' Bennett said. ``He's got a
record to run on and the record on drugs, I have to tell you, is
not what it should be.''
   Moynihan expressed surprise at Bennett's choice of words.
   ``How does such a man come to refer to the governor of the state
of New York as `this guy'?'' Moynihan asked. ``We recognize the
idiom. It is so-called `tough-guy talk.' It can be learned from

   A fast food restaurant chain is recalling
300,000 sports water bottles because the mouthpieces can present a
choking hazard to children.
   Taco Bell Corp. began offering the bottles for 99 cents to
customers at its 2,700 stores last Monday, but the promotional
campaign was suspended three days later after the company
``received a report from a customer that his 21-month-old child had
dismantled the bottle's mouthpiece and attempted to swallow it,''
the Consumer Product Safety Commission said.
   When a CPSC inspector tried to purchase a bottle last Friday he
was told store managers had been instructed to pack them up and
ship them back the day before, the agency said in a written

   ``It's the fastest work on a recall I've ever seen,'' said CPSC

   Consumers should return the bottles to the Taco Bell where

<TEXT>
   The foreign minister of
Czechoslovakia says the crumbling Warsaw Pact should be preserved
in some form to prevent the Soviet Union from becoming dangerously
isolated.
   ``For the first time, the Warsaw Pact is useful to us,'' Jiri
Dienstbier said Tuesday in an interview with The Associated Press
and two other news organizations.
   He said that as the Warsaw Pact moves away from its role as a
military alliance it can still play a role in European affairs.
   The Warsaw Pact, created in 1955 to help the Soviets keep their
Eastern European satellites in line, sent tanks into Czechoslovakia
to crush the 1968 ``Prague Spring'' reforms.
   Now, Czechoslovakia wants to remain in the alliance so it can
have a voice in negotiating disarmament and a new European security
order, Dienstbier said.
   Dienstbier was considered certain to keep his post in the new
Czechoslovak government. Parliamentary elections held last weekend
were won by the pro-democracy forces that led last year's
revolution.
   Recalling the isolation of Germany between the two world wars,
Dienstbier said of the Soviets: ``We should do everything to pull
them into Europe.''
   ``We don't want to create any Versailles complex in Russia,'' he
said, referring to the treaty that punished Germany at the end of
World War I. ``It's even more dangerous because they have all those
nuclear arms.''
   Warsaw Pact members met in Moscow last week, and the Soviets
agreed that the other six member nations should have command of
their own armies.
   They had nominal command before but never exercised it _ with
the exception of Romania' refusal to join the 1968 invasion of
Czechoslovakia. The alliance's supreme military commander was
always a top Soviet general or marshal.
   Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Poland want the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe to make its headquarters in
Prague. The 35-nation group includes the United States, Canada, the
Soviet Union and all European countries but Albania. Under the
three-nation proposal, a parallel center for arms control,
verification and confidence-building measures would also be
established in Berlin.
   The three east European nations want their idea discussed at a
meeting of the Conference on Security in Vienna on July 10. That
meeting is to pave the way for a Paris summit in December.
   Dienstbier and President Vaclav Havel of Czechslovakia have long
advocated the eventual breakup of the Warsaw Pact and its Western
counterpart, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Unlike Hungary's new leaders _ who want their country out of the
Warsaw Pact _ Dienstbier and Havel say the East bloc alliance
should break up only gradually. In the meantime, they want to
remain members.
   Dienstbier said there are ``positive forces in the Soviet
Union'' who want to work with Czechoslovakia, East Germany and
Poland on transforming European security.
   East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere told President
Bush in Washington on Monday that NATO must be ``significantly
changed'' to meet the Soviet Union's security concerns.
   The West is insisting that a united Germany be a full member of
NATO. Moscow opposes exclusive military allegiance to NATO for a
new Germany.
   The dispute has halted for the moment efforts to secure the
removal from East Germany of the 380,000 Soviet troops stationed
there.

   A FBI agent solved a year-old homicide by
confessing he strangled a pregnant woman with whom he had been
having an affair.
   Mark Putnam, 30, of Sunrise, Fla., was sentenced Tuesday to 16
years in prison after pleading guilty to manslaughter. His
confession allowed authorities to find the remains of Susan Daniels
Smith off a coal mine road in the eastern Kentucky hills.
   Putnam, who had used Ms. Smith as an informant in a bank robbery
and auto theft case, is believed to be the first agent in FBI
history charged or convicted of a homicide-related crime.
   Ms. Smith's family condemned the plea bargain because Putnam did
not stand trial for murder. A sister of the victim was cited for
trying to bring a concealed .38-caliber handgun into court before
the agent's appearance.
   Commonwealth's Attorney John Paul Runyon said that without
Putnam's June 4 confession, ``we had absolutely no evidence. Not
one scintilla or shred or evidence to bring a charge or convict
this man.''
   In a signed confession, Putnam described the night of June 8,
1989, when he choked Ms. Smith, 27, ``in an act of extreme rage.''
A 27-year-old divorced mother of two, she was four months pregnant
and insisted he was the father.
   According to her family, she wanted Putnam to leave his wife and
two young children in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Their affair began in
December 1988.
   Putnam, who resigned Friday, is eligible for parole in eight
years.
   Ms. Smith's sister, Shelby Ward, 35, was ordered to appear in
court June 26 after she was released for trying to enter court with
a handgun, State Police said. Police gave no further details.
   ``This is the dirtiest county I've ever seen in my life,'' Ms.
Ward said. ``I think they're covering everything up.''
   Ms. Ward said she had no intention of using the gun in court.
``I always keep my pistol in my purse'' for protection, she said.
``But when I get in the car, I take it out and put it on the seat.
This morning I forgot.''
   Putnam, who was transferred to Miami in May 1989 after two years
in Pikeville, was handcuffed and taken into custody.
   Terry O'Connor, agent in charge for the FBI in Kentucky, said
Putnam received no preferential treatment. ``We had no role with
any aspect of the plea agreement,'' he said.
   Earlier in the day, the victim's family filed a lawsuit against
Putnam in alleging wrongful death. Attorney Larry Webster said the
lawsuit would ask for millions of dollars, primarily to benefit Ms.
Smith's 4-year-old boy and 8-year-old girl.

<HEAD>First Lady Leaves Presidential Residence in Marital Tiff</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the latest episode in the saga
of President Carlos Menem's marital troubles, the first lady moved
out of the presidential residence rather than face legal eviction.
   Mrs. Zulema Menem, wearing a light blue jogging suit, stood
Tuesday outside the high brick wall that surrounds the compound and
demanded a showdown.
   ``If I can't go in, let the president and no one else tell me
so,'' she said.
   After a fruitless wait, she drove with her two adult children to
the couple's apartment in Buenos Aires' Recoleta neighborhood,
leaving the 65-acre suburban estate in nearby Olivos vacant.
   Mrs. Menem had moved to the apartment on Monday.
   Menem asked his estranged wife to ``leave the residence and this
was accomplished without any kind of violence due to the fact that
she already had left,'' said Raul Granillo Ocampo, Menem's legal
secretary.
   Air Force Brig. Andres Antonietti, chief of the presidential
military staff, had gone to the residence to persuade Mrs. Menem to
leave without incident ``and found that she already had left,''
Ocampo said.
   Menem himself moved out of the residence on May 8. By law, the
president has exclusive power to say who may live in the luxurious
residence.
   ``We're leaving because the president has thrown us out,'' son
Carlos told reporters Tuesday, though Ocampo said the decree
barring the wife's re-entry does not apply to the two children,
Carlos, 21, and his sister, Zulemita, 19.
   In all, Menem and his wife have been apart for nearly as long as
they've been together in their 24-year-old marriage.
   According to observers, a major factor in the discord is that
Mrs. Menem wants a government post and her husband says no.
   Mrs. Menem, 46, told reporters last week she had no plans to
leave the residence and hoped her husband would return home
following a 12-day foreign trip. Menem, who arrived back in Buenos
Aires on Sunday, instead went to his apartment.
   The couple's marital strife became news after Menem, 59, moved
out of the residence amid reports he would seek a legal separation
or divorce.
   While there have been reports of marital troubles for years,
Menem has refused to discuss the situation with the media.
   Mrs. Menem has publicly accused her husband of being a
``womanizer'' and has assailed his social policies, his free-market
economic plan and his staff.
   The presidential residence was donated to the government by a
wealthy family in 1920 on condition it be used by the president. If
the president fails to live in the house for six consecutive
months, the donors have the right to request its return, according
to a presidential decree.
   Menem, a former governor of the poor interior province of La
Rioja, became president last July. He and his wife are of Syrian
descent.
   While both are members of the labor-based Peronist party, since
becoming president Menem has advocated the sale of money-losing
state companies to help right Argentina's impoverished economy.
   Mrs. Menem has criticized this plan, which is anathema to
hard-line Peronists.

   Hundreds of club-wielding police broke
up a 50-day-old anti-government protest in central Bucharest early
Wednesday, arresting more than 100 protesters. A reporter said
several dozen were beaten.
   The demonstrators had put up a small tent city in University
Square to protest what they consider the Communist domination of
the governing National Salvation Front that has been in power since
the December revolution.
   The raid Wednesday effectively cleared the square, which had
been closed to traffic by the demonstration.
   On Tuesday, the Prosecutor's Office issued a communique saying
``profiteering, prostitution and gambling, theft and violence and
drug abuse'' were practiced in the square where ``dangerous
criminals sought refuge.''
   It asked the government to ``take due measures in order to
restore public order in keeping with the laws in force.''
   Police moved in at 3:55 a.m.
   A woman who said she lived on the seventh floor of a nearby
apartment building said: ``I first heard two men shout the warning
``Everybody flee,'' and then I looked out of my window and saw the
police proceed very quickly. It all lasted less than 20 minutes.''
   She spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.
   About 300 police officers sealed off the area with trucks and
buses. Demonstrators seeking shelter in the adjacent
Intercontinental Hotel broke in through its glass door but were
seized and removed by police.
   A photojournalist said several dozen demonstrators were clubbed
by police.
   ``We arrested over 100, and among them were those who spat at us
at the television station yesterday, as well as the one who
imitates (deposed and executed dictator Nicolae) Ceausescu's
voice,'' said a police officers with a blood-stained shirt sleeve.
   ``It's not my blood'' the policeman said proudly.
   He would not give his name.
   Police the film of an Associated Press photographer as he took
pictures of them removing the tents, although they later allowed
picture-taking as several trucks carried heaps of dirt left behind
by the improvised camp.

<HEAD>Nikkei Recovers After Morning Losses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange recovered
Wednesday afternoon from its morning losses and ended higher, and
the dollar inched up against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 154.55 yen, up 0.15 yen from Tuesday's
154.40-yen finish. It opened at 155.08 yen and ranged between
154.40 yen and 155.08 yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average regained 49.46 points, or
0.15 percent, ending the day at 32,371.77. The index closed the
morning session with a 101.48-point loss before rebounding in the
afternoon.
   Traders said the index's afternoon recovery was inspired by
large-scale buying from major securities houses, which prompted
other participants to buy.
   The index in the morning fell because market players were
largely discouraged by the yen's weakness and the index's drops
since Monday, said Tomoyuki Morimoto, a trader with New Japan
Securities Co.
   The Nikkei fell 670.98 points on Monday and Tuesday together.
   In currency dealings, dealers said the dollar fluctuated around
155 yen in mixed trading as institutional investors bought the
currency while exporters sold it.
   Most market players, however, remained reluctant to make major
moves ahead of a series of U.S. economic data to be released this
week, they said. Among the announcements are the nation's retail
sales for May, April merchandise trade and May consumer and
producer prices.

   State Sen. Theo Mitchell's roots lie in a
poor neighborhood of Greenville, but his political branches now
stretch toward the governor's mansion.
   The 51-year-old lawyer is hoping to become South Carolina's
first black governor. On Tuesday, he became the first black in this
century to head a major party ticket in South Carolina when he
earned the Democratic gubernatorial nomination over freshman state
Sen. Ernest Passailaigue.
   If successful, Mitchell would be the second black elected
governor in the country, following L. Douglas Wilder's victory last
year in Virginia. He enters the race an underdog to popular
Republican Gov. Carroll Campbell.
   ``I don't think race will play any role,'' Mitchell said of the
general election campaign, ``and I don't think race should play any
role.''
   Mitchell grew up during the era of Jim Crow laws in a poor
family dominated by his mother. He played high school football with
the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has endorsed his bid for governor.
   He studied biology at Fisk University in Nashville, Tenn.,
hoping to become a surgeon, and transferred a year later to Howard
University. He was the first member of his family to attend college
and paid his tuition by working odd jobs.
   After working in cancer research for five years at the National
Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., he decided against medicine
as a career and turned to law.
   Mitchell received his law degree from Howard in 1969 and
returned to Greenville in 1970 to join a legal assistance program
emphasizing poverty law. He now heads his own firm.
   In 1982, Mitchell was indicted on charges of illegally receiving
$5,390 in food stamps, but a mistrial was declared when the jury
could not reach a verdict and a retrial was never held. Mitchell
has dismissed the case as political harassment.
   He has served in the Legislature since 1974, two years after he
made an unsuccessful bid for Congress. After his first election, he
was re-elected every two years until 1984, when he won election to
the state Senate.
   Mitchell has made health and human resource development his main
campaign issues, emphasizing help for the elderly and those in
substandard housing. He also supports extending public
transportation around the state and says he would repeal the sales
tax on food over a five-year period.

<TEXT>
   As many as 50 prominent people have been arrested
in Somalia this week after signing a statement criticizing the
government, Amnesty International says.
   Those detained included the East African country's former
president, 81-year-old Aden Abdulle Osman, and members of the
civilian government overthrown by Maj. Gen. Mohamed Siad Barre in a
1969 coup, the international human rights organization reported
Tuesday.
   Amnesty said arrests were continuing as security police searched
for others among the more than 100 signatories of the May 15
statement.
   ``We had information about the arrests from inside the country
from a source which has proved highly reliable previously,''
Amnesty spokeswoman Serena Lim said.
   ``We were due to send a deputation to Somalia this week to
discuss human rights with the government but the visit was
postponed by the government at short notice.''
   A news release said many of those arrested had been released
earlier after long imprisonment without charge or trial.
   Amnesty said it was ``deeply concerned'' over the arrests of
non-violent critics of the government.
   It said the May 15 manifesto expressed concern at the
destruction, killings and flight of refugees in Somalia's civil war
and attacked the government for purported violations of human
rights, corruption and economic mismanagement.
   The manifesto asked that a committee be formed to prepare for a
national conference of reconciliation and salvation aimed at ending
the civil war.
   Civil war broke out in 1988 between the government and the
Somali National Movement. At least 400,000 refugees have fled to
neighboring Ethiopia.

   A federal judge impounded a tanker to ensure
its owner and operator pay any damages resulting from a
260,000-gallon oil spill in New York Harbor caused when the vessel
ran aground.
   U.S. District Judge Nicholas Politan signed an order Tuesday
that blocks the BT Nautilus from leaving Bayonne, where it was
docking when the accident occurred Thursday.
   New Jersey and New York state and city officials Tuesday had
sued the owner, Nautilus Motor Tanker Co., and operator, Bulk
Tanker Management Ltd., both of London. The lawsuit accused them of
negligence and demanded impoundment.
   The tanker ran aground in the Kill Van Kull, a waterway that
separates Bayonne and New York's Staten Island. The cause of the
accident has not been determined, the Coast Guard said.
   The tanker's first mate, Gregory Frederick Geoffrey, 52, of New
Marske, England, has been charged with operating a vessel while
intoxicated.
   Charles Anderson, a lawyer for the owners of the 811-foot ship,
characterized the impoundment as routine and said he expects the
company's underwriters to post bond. He denied allegations of
negligence.
   Officials said they wanted to send a tough message to polluters.
The spill was the fourth major one in the Kill Van Kull and another
nearby waterway this year.
   ``We're not going to just sit back. We will take every action
available to guarantee that those who pollute don't stick us with
the cost of cleanup,'' said Gov. Jim Florio.
   Hundreds of workers Tuesday continued to clean the shores and
waters of the waterway.

<HEAD>Moslem Fundamentalists Defeat Ruling Party In First Free Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL GOLDSMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Moslem fundamentalist group defeated
the party that has ruled Algeria since independence 30 years ago in
the country's first multiparty elections, the interior minister
said today.
   Interior Minister Mohamed-Salah Mohammedi said the Islamic
Salvation Front was ``pre-eminent'' in local elections Tuesday for
1,541 municipal and 48 provincial council seats. The voting was
marked by a low turnout because of a boycott by much of the
opposition.
   Mohammedi said the fundamentalists were followed by the ruling
National Liberation Front and the anti-clerical Rally for Culture
and Democracy. He did not provide figures. Official results were
expected later today.
   The municipal and provincial elections do not directly affect
the national legislative body, the People's National Assembly.
   The National Liberation Front was the sole political party in
the North African nation of 24 million people until constitutional
changes in February 1989 opened the way to competing parties.
   Leaders of the centrist opposition had claimed the election was
rigged because the National Liberation Front controls nearly all
the media, has greater resources than other parties and has
functionaries in local government offices where votes were counted.
   The Interior Ministry said earlier that only 55 percent of 13
million eligible voters participated in the election. The turn-out
figures showed a considerable range, from 73 percent in the town of
El-Tarf to approximately 50 percent in the capital and just 16
percent in the Berber town of Tizi-Ouzou.
   The turnout was lowest in districts dominated by the Berber
movement, the Front of Socialist Forces, led by Hocine Ait Ahmed.
He joined the left-leaning, populist Movement for Democracy, headed
by exiled former president Ahmed Ben Bella, in urging voters to
stay home.
   Police were deployed around the country as the nation's official
media urged Algerians to vote in ``this first test of democracy.''
   ``It is a great day which is being added to the realization of
the Algerian revolution,'' President Chadli Bendjedid said before
the election.
   The boycott, organized by Ait-Ahmed and Ben Bella _ the leading
opposition figures among the nearly two dozen parties that have
sprung up since pluralism was legalized last year _ left the highly
organized fundamentalists to challenge the ruling National
Liberation Front, which turned Algeria into a one-party state after
winning a war of independence against France in 1962.
   Fundamentalist leader Abassi Madani, a philosophy teacher,
declared in a widely reported speech last week that he expected his
party to get 75 percent of the vote.
   The statement was denounced as a ``trouble-making provocation''
by several hundred fellow university professors and lecturers.
   For months, fundamentalist supporters have been accused of
harrassing single women and disrupting nightclubs in the Algiers
region, prompting denunciations from other political groups.
   In the Algiers suburb of El Harrach, the National Liberation
Front withdrew from the elections, accusing the fundamentalists of
``exercising moral violence against the voters and committing
serious violations against the election law.'' The statement did
not elaborate.
   The official news agency reported several groups of Islamic
supporters tried to overrun some Algiers voting stations, alleging
the vote counting was influenced by the government.
   Numerous voters in the Algiers district were turned away from
polling booths when they appeared without the necessary documents.
Among those blocked were men who tried to exercise their right to
vote on behalf of their wife _ or wives _ without written
authorization.
   The National Liberation Front was forced to give up its monopoly
on power after soldiers killed scores of people in October 1988
riots sparked by deteriorating economic conditions. Constitutional
changes adopted in February 1989 legalized pluralism.
   The Islamic Salvation Front seeks to establish the Islamic legal
code, the Sharia, as law and openly opposes the democratic process.

<HEAD>Soviet Legislature Passes First Press Freedom Law</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Soviet Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Soviet legislature has passed the
country's first press freedom law, which gives any Soviet citizen
the right to found a newspaper and guarantees broad rights for
journalists and publishers.
   The new law, which passed unanimously on Tuesday, intends to end
decades of censorship of the Soviet media by the Communist Party,
the government and a special agency established to kept the media
under tight control.
   ``The press and other mass media are free,'' the law begins
bluntly, and ``censorship of the mass media is forbidden.''
   However, the law does not address how those who want to publish
their own newspapers will obtain newsprint, which is often in short
supply.
   The Soviet government controls all paper mills and the supply of
newsprint and other materials needed to publish newspapers. It also
controls all radio and television stations.
   After President Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in 1985 and
introduced the policy of glasnost, or openess, political pressure
on the Soviet media began to lighten, but there was still no legal
protection from interference.
   Technically, freedom of the press is guaranteed by a declaration
in the Soviet Constitution, but Tuesday's measure was the first law
laying out detailed guarantees of press freedoms, the Tass news
agency reported.
   The law establishes procedures for creating media outlets and
specifies journalists' rights. They include the right to attend
meetings and be present at the scene of disasters, the right to
refuse to prepare reports that go against personal convictions and
the right to interview officials.
   The provision giving any individual the right to establish a
media outlet created the sharpest debate in the Supreme Soviet,
Tass reported.
   ``However, it was agreed that the right to establish a
publication is one of the main democratic freedoms envisaged in the
international covenants on human rights which the Soviet Union has
joined, and it is necessary to enforce them,'' the state-run news
agency said.
   The law forbids publication of state secrets, but Tass said
penalties would be imposed on the official who leaked them rather
than the journalist who reported them.
   It also forbids slander and ``use of the mass media to interfere
in citizens' private lives, infringement on their honor and
dignity.''
   Pornography, long outlawed in the Soviet Union, remains illegal,
although Soviet media _ including television _ have begun showing
nudity fairly often.
   The law, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press,
does not specify the penalties for slander and other abuses of
press freedoms, saying they can be established by the courts
according to existing or future laws.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's chief index closed
higher today despite a morning setback, while the dollar kept
inching up against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average closed at 32,371.77, up 49.46
points, or 0.15 percent, from Tuesday's close.
   The index was down 101.48 points at the end of the morning
session.
   In the afternoon, however, four major securities houses _ Nomura
Securities Co., Yamaichi Securities Co., Nikko Securities Co. and
Daiwa Securities Co. _ made large purchases, said Katsumi
Horikoshi, a trader with Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru Securities Co.
   ``That encouraged participants to pick up underpriced issues
after the morning decline,'' he said.
   In the morning, investors had stepped off to the sidelines,
discouraged by the yen's weakness against the dollar as well as the
index's decline since Monday, said Tomoyuki Morimoto, a trader with
New Japan Securities Co.
   The Nikkei fell a total of 670.98 points on Monday and Tuesday.
   Trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at 450
million shares, down from Tuesday's 500 million.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 154.55 yen, up 0.15
yen from Tuesday's 154.40-yen finish. It opened at 155.08 yen, its
high for the day, and ranged as low as 154.40 yen.
   The dollar has risen on 11 of the last 12 trading days, gaining
5.10 yen in all.
   Its higher opening today followed its overnight gains in New
York, and life insurance and investment trust companies bought the
dollar in early trading. But then it edged lower because of strong
selling pressure a little above the 155-yen level, said Toshiaki
Kanisaka, a dealer with Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank.
   About $10.6 billion changed hands in spot trading, down from
Tuesday's $13.98 billion.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 87.62 points as of 5 p.m. (4 a.m.
EDT) from Tuesday's close of 87.45. The yield stood at 7.050
percent, down from the previous day's 7.085 percent.

   A convicted killer who once was sprung from a Cuban
prison by Jesse Jackson has been arrested in the 1987 slaying of
Don Aronow, a powerboat builder whose customers included the
Customs service and President Bush.
   Robert Young, 41, was jailed on murder charges here Tuesday,
Metro-Dade police said Tuesday.
   Aronow, 59, designer of Donzi and Cigarette speedboats and a
world champion powerboat racer, was shot several times shot by a
motorist who waited for him at his marina on a stretch known as
Thunderboat Row, authorities said.
   The slaying shocked Miami and the boat world, where Aronow was
highly respected _ enough to have designed the Blue Thunder
speedboats for the Customs Service to chase drug dealers speeding
to Florida from the Bahamas.
   Investigators believed at least two people were in the waiting
car, The Miami Herald reported today.
   Police and Gary Rosenberg, an assistant state attorney, released
few other details. Asked if anyone else is being charged with the
crime, Rosenberg said, ``Not today.''
   Aronow had sold his fast boats to celebrities around the world,
including Bush, who named his boat Fidelity. Also on his list of
customers were King Juan Carlos of Spain, the former shah of Iran
and ex-Beatle Ringo Starr.
   Young was in an Oklahoma prison serving a federal drug sentence
when he was arrested, said his attorney, Virgil Black.
   ``He's been a suspect in the killing, along with everybody
else,'' said Black. ``He finally said, `File it.' He's confident
he'll be acquitted. He didn't do it.''
   In May 1988, Miami police told the Metro-Dade department that a
federal prisoner had given information that Young was involved in
the Aronow slaying.
   Young was a passenger on a boat reportedly containing 300 pounds
of marijuana and was held with another man by Cuban authorities
until Jackson engineered their release for humanitarian reasons in
1984.
   Six months later, Young shot a crime figure after problems over
a gun-running deal. Young is serving time in that slaying.
   In 1988, Young also was indicted in Oklahoma City on charges of
taking part in a Colombian drug smuggling operation. He was later
convicted.

   A study of premature babies of below-normal
weight shows their IQ can be boosted by special education in their
first years.
   Loraine Stern, a pediatrician at the University of California at
Los Angeles, said the study in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association also showed the importance of parental
involvement in a child's early years.
   ``You can't recapture what you lose in the first few years,''
she said.
   In the four-year study, one-third of 985 babies born in 1985 in
eight states received educational help. Researchers visited the
home, advised parents, provided educational toys and arranged
visits to a child development center.
   Infants who weighed between 4.4 and 5.5 pounds at birth and
received educational help and medical care scored an average of 98
at age 3, or 13.2 IQ points higher than children who had been in
the same weight range at birth but received only medical care. The
average IQ is 100.
   Infants who weighed about 4.3 pounds or less at birth and were
given the educational help scored an average of 91 at age 3, or 6.6
IQ points higher than similar infants getting only medical care,
wrote the researchers led by Dr. Ruth Gross of Stanford University.
   Arnold Sameroff, a psychologist who teaches at Brown University
and practices at Bradley Hospital in Providence, R.I., said the
children in the study got such multifaceted help, other researchers
will find it hard to tell what made the difference.
   Almost 7 percent of babies born in the United States, or 250,000
a year, weigh 5.5 pounds or less at birth. Though these
low-birth-weight babies have a much better chance of survival than
in years past, they still are at risk of retarded development.

<TEXT>
   USAir says it should have detained and questioned
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis for joking as he boarded a plane that there
could be a bomb in the luggage of a White House aide taking the
same flight.
   Dukakis made the comment Sunday night at Logan International
Airport. Also on the flight was Republican Ron Kaufman, an aide to
President Bush, said Patricia Goldman, a USAir spokeswoman in
Arlington, Va.
   Ms. Goldman said Monday that Dukakis joked about the possibility
of a bomb in Kaufman's luggage. The supervisor on duty recognized
the governor, determined the comments were made jokingly and ``let
it go,'' she said.
   Ms. Goldman said allowing Dukakis to board was an error in
procedure, according to Federal Aviation Administration rules.
   ``If he made a comment, even in jest, he should have been
questioned. That is our procedure,'' Ms. Goldman said.
   The governor, asked about the incident by reporters in
Washington, said, ``The humor of it was obvious to everyone who was
there.''
   Massachusetts Democrats have charged that Kaufman may have had a
hand in a police union protest that disrupted the state Democratic
convention in Springfield on June 2.
   ``After going through the experiences that the Democrats went
through in Springfield, I can tell you we will always be concerned
when Mr. Kaufman is around,'' the governor said.
   Kaufman, in a telephone interview, said of Sunday night's
incident, ``Given the psychological terror people have of bombs and
flying, it was irresponsible for a man in his position to joke
about something like that.''
   He said he did not hear Dukakis' comments when he was boarding.

<HEAD>Blast Damages Mansion, Animal Rights Extremists Suspected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTLEY WINTNEY, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A explosion that tore through
the front of a historic mansion was believed caused by a bomb,
raising suspicions that animal rights extremists might be
responsible, police said today.
   The 18th century West Green House in this village 55 miles from
London was unoccupied when the blast tore out brickwork and blew in
windows shortly before midnight Wednesday. Police said no one was
hurt.
   The mansion, owned by the state-aided National Trust, was until
last month the home of Lord McAlpine, a building construction
millionaire and former deputy chairman of the governing
Conservative Party.
   McAlpine, whose interests include a zoo in Broome, Australia,
was attacked by animal rights extremists five years ago, Hampshire
County police said. They gave no further details.
   ``We are looking closely at the animal rights angle, but have
not ruled out any group or organization,'' said Hampshire police
Inspector Barry Jakeman.
   ``We think the blast was the result of a bomb ... in all
probability it was the result of a terrorist attack,'' he told
reporters.
   McAlpine, 48, lived in West Green House for 10 years and spent
millions of dollars restoring it, the National Trust said. He moved
out last month, and also resigned then as treasurer of the
Conservative Party.
   On Sunday, a bomb planted by animal rights extremists in the
southwest England city of Bristol blew up the car of a veterinary
surgeon whose research work involves animal experiments.
   The scientist was thrown clear but a 13-month-old child in a
stroller on the sidewalk was injured.
   A shadowy group, the Animal Liberation Front, claimed
responsibility. Main stream opponents of animal experiments
denounced the attack as damaging their cause.

   South American guerrillas holding an
American hostage rejected the $60,000 ransom payment because they
want it in Colombian pesos, not dollars, his family says. They also
are doubting the family's plea of poverty.
   Heavy rains also have contributed to delays in obtaining the
release of Scott Heimdal, and negotiators must now wait a few days
while the ransom is changed into pesos and the weather cooperates,
Heimdal's family says.
   Heimdal's mother, Marge Heimdal, said Tuesday a new date has
been set for another jungle meeting along the Colombia-Ecuador
border with a go-between and the guerrillas. She would not disclose
the date for security reasons.
   Roy Heimdal, the man's father, said the kidnappers are doubting
the family's claims of poverty after seeing TV coverage of their
efforts last week to raise the ransom.
   ``They saw pictures of our house,'' Heimdal said of the modest,
wood-frame bungalow. ``Our house is no mansion. But by their
standards it is. I guess they figure anyone who eats three square
meals a day has $60,000 laying around.''
   Scott Heimdal, a 27-year-old employee of an Americann gold
mining company, was abducted while working in Ecuador on April 28.
He was believed to have been taken hostage by guerrillas of the
Popular Liberation Army.
   The kidnappers initially demanded $1.2 million but lowered the
figure, and the money was raised by donations that poured in to the
Heimdals, including waitresses' tips and proceeds from nursing-home
bake sales.
   ``The intermediary had problems getting up the river because
they've had heavy rain and the river is swollen,'' the elder
Heimdal said.
   ``Then the guerrillas got upset because the ransom money came in
U.S. dollars instead of pesos. When they tried to exchange it, they
had trouble finding enough pesos. So things aren't going so
smoothly.''
   Heimdal said the unidentified go-between was trying to convince
the kidnappers the working-class family is financially strapped.
The family says its savings were wiped out by medical bills after
Mrs. Heimdal was seriously injured in a 1983 car accident.

<HEAD>Boat People Claim To Have Skeletons Of 30 Americans Killed In
Vietnam</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nine Vietnamese boat people have
given police the skeletons of 30 people, stuffed in seven barrels,
that they claim were from Americans killed in the Vietnam War,
officials said today.
   Paul Blakeburn, charge d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy, said he
doubted the bones were those of Americans missing in action: ``It
is possible, but it is not likely to be true.''
   Embassy press officer Meg Gilroy said Malaysian authorities
would hand the bones over to the embassy soon.
   She said an official from either the Joint Casualty Resolution
Center in Bangkok, Thailand, or the U.S. Defense Department
Forensic Laboratory in Hawaii would take them to Hawaii for tests
to determine if they belong to U.S. troops. She said the embassy
did not know yet how the Vietnamese obtained the bones, which
Malaysian officials said had been handed over to police in the Kota
Tinggi district, 150 miles south of Kuala Lumpur.
   The Kota Tinggi police station, contacted by telephone, said
some Vietnamese had landed Monday with skeletons at a beach 40
miles to the east but could not provide further details.
   The newspaper New Straits Times said today that police had found
metal tags on the skeletons. It quoted Deputy Superintendent of
Police Roslan Dolah as saying, ``The tags had the names and unit
numbers and addresses of the dead men, believed to have been killed
during the Vietnam War.''
   The refugees' 52-foot boat had the words ``USA Remains in my
Boat'' and ``This Boat Have USA Army Remains'' written on its
sides, the paper reported.
   It also quoted Roslan as saying the nine Vietnamese, aged
between 18 and 56, told police they had left Vietnam on May 30 and
had to land Monday when their boat sprang a leak.
   The refugees were sent to a refugee camp in nearby Mersing.
   ``We are investigating the reasons for the refugees bringing the
skeletons with them. ... We have not come across such cases
before,'' the paper quoted Roslan as saying.
   It added, ``It is understood the refugees were en route to
Singapore to hand over the skeletons to the American Embassy. By
doing so, the refugees not only hoped to gain refuge to the U.S.
but also to get some monetary reward in exchange for the
skeletons.''
   Singapore is about 60 miles south of where they landed.
   The United States now lists 2,303 Americans as missing from the
Indochina War. These include 1,678 in Vietnam.
   Refugee officials said this was not the first time Vietnamese
refugees had claimed to have brought bones of American soldiers.
But the presence of metal tags would make this case different, they
said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed in early European trading
today, rising against most currencies but falling against the
strong British pound and the Swiss franc.
   Gold prices fell.
   Dealers said the pound continued to rise on rumors that Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's government plans to link sterling to
the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System later
this year.
   The system links all the currencies of the European Community
except those of Britain, Portugal and Greece.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.15 yen to a closing 154.55 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a higher rate of 154.65 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.6952 West German marks, up from 1.6920
   _1.4343 Swiss francs, down from 1.4367
   _5.7055 French francs, up from 5.6950
   _1.9090 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9045
   _1,245.00 Italian lire, up from 1,242.35
   _1.1715 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1713.
   In London, the pound's rise against the dollar took sterling to
$1.7043, compared with $1.7020 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $353 a troy ounce, down
from $356.25 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $353, unchanged from
the opening bid.
   Dealers said the price was depressed by selling in New York.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $353.50, down from $355.65 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.66 to close at $355.16.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid of $5 an ounce, compared
with $5.06 late Tuesday.

   The government rushed 3,000 more
soldiers today to the east coast, where Tamil rebels were attacking
military camps and scores of people were believed to have been
killed, government officials said.
   Military officials said they feared the rebels had killed more
than 100 police among 600 taken prisoner in eastern Batticaloa
district on Monday.
   In addition to the policemen, residents and rebels in the east
said as many as 90 people have died in the violence, the worst
confrontation between troops and rebels since peace talks started
in May 1989.
   The officials cited a report from an injured policeman, who was
among the 600 captured when rebels took command of 11 police
stations in the east.
   They said the policeman escaped the rebels and reached a
military camp on Tuesday, reporting that 115 of his colleagues had
been shot to death by rebels.
   There was no independent confirmation of the alleged killings
since government troops have been restricted to their camps and
communication lines to the east are down, officials said.
   Tamil rebels have been fighting for more political autonomy in
Sri Lanka since 1983. They claim they are discriminated against by
the majority Sinhalese. Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16
million people, while Sinhalese make up 75 percent.
   Military officials today could only confirm that 16 soldiers
were killed and 12 injured in the fighting up to 6 a.m. this
morning. They said rebels were burning the bodies of soldiers and
police officers.
   The new attacks today on the camps at Kiran, Kalavanchukudi and
Kalmunai, all in Batticaloa district, came hours before a
cease-fire was to take effect, the officials said.
   The cease-fire was supposed to begin at noon, but fighting was
still going on as the deadline passed.
   Throughout the night, rebels seized an additional seven police
stations, seizing arms and ammunition.
   Reinforcements of government troops were rushed to the area. The
3,000 fresh troops comprised three battalions, military officials
said.
   The battalions were an addition to four companies, totaling
1,200 soldiers, that had been deployed Tuesday to regions where
fighting has raged for three straight days, officials said.
   The fighting apparently broke out when a Tamil man told rebels
of the dominant Tamil militia, the Tigers, that he had been
assaulted by a Sinhalese policemen at the Batticaloa police station
on Sunday, officials said.
   The Tigers on Monday ordered policemen out of the station and
took command.
   The Tigers took virtual control of the country's northeastern
districts after Indian peacekeeping forces withdrew in March.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa's government, which has been
negotiating with the Tigers for the past year, requested the
Indians' departure.
   At least 11,000 people, including 1,200 Indian soldiers, have
been killed in the Tamil war since it started in 1983.
   Another 6,000 have been killed since 1987 in a backlash to Tamil
demands whipped up by ultranationalist Sinhalese guerrillas.

<HEAD>Operation Successful to Replace Woman's Torn-Off Scalp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman whose scalp was torn off from the
eyelids to the nape of her neck, exposing the skull, had her scalp
sewn back on in a 14-hour operation. ``She going to be just fine,''
the lead surgeon said.
   A team of five surgeons worked with high-powered microscopes to
replace the woman's entire scalp, small blood vessels and other
tissues torn from her head last week in a vineyard accident in Napa
Valley.
   ``She was an attractive woman before...she will be an attractive
woman when it's over,'' said Dr. Alfonso Oliva, who conducted the
surgery at Ralph K. Davies Medical Center.
   The 33-year-old vineyard manager, whose family asked that her
name not be released, was working in the field at Domaine Chandon
on June 4 when her hair caught in the rotor of a sprayer
crankshaft, the hospital said Tuesday.
   Though horrified, the woman's co-workers had enough presence to
preserve the scalp. The woman was sped by ambulance to a nearby
hospital in Napa, and then 50 miles to San Francisco, where the
operation was done within 12 hours of the accident.
   Oliva said his team reconnected two of the major arteries to the
scalp. Three veins in the exposed skull were rejoined using vein
grafts from the woman's feet, and eight blood vessels, some ``as
small as the width of lead in a mechanical pencil,'' were rejoined.
   Oliva said despite the severity of the accident, the woman will
recover with little outward sign of the ordeal. Most of the scars,
he said, will be covered by natural skin folds and hair.
   ``The actual suture line is just above the eyelids, right where
you would cut for a routine eye lift,'' he said. ``The scars at the
nape of the neck and above the ears will be covered by her hair.''
   Oliva said that during her recovery the woman cannot recline or
place her head against a pillow.
   ``Two days after the surgery, she was sitting there joking about
sleeping in a `Buddha position,''' said Oliva. ``This woman is
going to be just fine.''

<HEAD>Radical Group Vows To Fight For Closing of American Cultural
Center</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fugitive leader of an outlawed
radical student group vowed today to continue to fight to close a
newly opened U.S. cultural center in the provincial city of Kwangju.
   Song Kap-suk of the National Council of Student Representatives
also accused U.S. Ambassador Donald P. Gregg of meddling in South
Korean politics and demanded his recall.
   Song made the comments at a hastily arranged news conference at
Seoul's Hanyang University. He was surrounded by student bodyguards
with masks over their faces and armed with metal pipes and
firebombs.
   Song, a student at Kwangju's Chonnam University, is wanted by
police for allegedly plotting a firebomb attack on a U.S.
diplomatic building in Seoul last month.
   The cultural center in Kwangju, 156 miles south of Seoul, was
reopened earlier this week after being closed for 13 months due to
repeated violent attacks by radicals.
   The students claim the center is a front for CIA activities and
represents an imperialist government.
   On Tuesday, hundreds of radical students wielding firebombs and
rocks tried to attack the cultural center but were repelled by riot
police firing tear gas, news reports said.
   ``Shutdown U.S. cultural center!'' students yelled, ``Yankee go
home!''
   Ambassador Gregg, a former CIA station chief in Seoul in the
1970s, was national security adviser to then-Vice President George
Bush during the Reagan administration.
   Song called for the withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S. troops
stationed in South Korea, saying their presence hinders unification
talks on the peninsula. He also demanded that American nuclear
weapons, allegedly kept on the peninsula, be withdrawn. Both
demands have been made by Communist North Korea.
   Washington never has acknowledged the presence of nuclear
weapons in Korea.
   Song also demanded anew that the United States apologize for its
role in South Korea's bloody suppression of a civil uprising in
Kwangju in 1980.
   Anti-American sentiments are strong in Kwangju and many
residents believe the United States condoned the suppression. No
South Koreans have been held accountable.
   By official count about 200 people were killed and more than
1,700 injured. Citizens in Kwangju say the numbers are much higher.
   In a recent reply to open letters from Song's group and another
dissident organization, Gregg denied any U.S. responsibility for
the Kwangju suppression.

   Faced with a splintering empire, Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev is proposing to counter secessionist drives by
transforming the Soviet Union into a looser federation of sovereign
states, officials say.
   The Soviet leader has also significantly softened his position
on German reunification, saying a united Germany could be an
``associate member'' of the NATO alliance while at the same time
joining a new pan-European security order.
   He did not define exactly what ``associate membership'' would
entail, but the Kremlin up to now has opposed a new Germany whose
sole military allegiance is to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   Gorbachev made his proposal about the Soviet republics on
Tuesday, the same day the parliament of the huge Russian republic
approved a resolution declaring its laws to carry more weight than
federal statutes.
   Also Tuesday, Gorbachev met with the presidents of Latvia,
Lithuania and Estonia after refusing for weeks to negotiate with
the secessionist Baltic republics unless they agreed to abide by
the Soviet constitution.
   President Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania hinted that the
Kremlin might soon end the economic embargo imposed on his republic.
   Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who attended the session,
said today that it produced definite progress on the impasse over
the Baltic states' independence declarations.
   He said if the Baltic republics went ahead and accepted the
Kremlin proposal that they suspend their independence moves and
begin negotiations, ``great possibilities for future talks will be
opened.''
   Ryzhkov was scheduled to meet today with Lithuanian Prime
Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene to discuss ``practical steps'' toward
better relations, he said. Ryzhkov said he was confident that ``the
Lithuanian question is finally getting off the ground.''
   Gorbachev met with the Baltic presidents after a session with
the Federation Council, an advisory body consisting of the
presidents of all 15 Soviet republics.
   He said he had summoned the council to begin work on ``realizing
the key idea of deeply re-forming our federation.''
   Gorbachev proposed that the country's republics agree on a new,
looser union of ``sovereign states,'' officials said after the
meeting.
   The 59-year-old Soviet leader has pledged repeatedly since last
fall to work out a new union treaty. Some reformers would like to
transform the Soviet Union into a confederation of independent
countries, like the European Community or the British Commonwealth.
   Tuesday's proposal for a union of ``sovereign states'' is the
closest that Gorbachev has come to publicly considering such a
radical change.
   The Russian resolution has no immediate legal effect.
   But if it takes hold, it could bring a dramatic reduction in
Gorbachev's authority because Russia includes 52 percent of the
Soviet Union's population and three-quarters of its land mass.
   The Russian Congress of People's Deputies, under the leadership
of radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin, voted 907-13 for the
declaration. The statement was weaker than originally proposed,
because it says Russia's sovereignty _ and the priority of its laws
ver national ones _ will be worked out in a new Russian
constitution and union treaty.
   Any new treaty that keeps the Soviet Union as a single country
would be likely to shift substantial powers from the federal
government to the republics. Gorbachev has promised repeatedly that
a new federation structure would solve the republics' grievances,
but independence activists have dismissed his assurances in the
past for lack of a concrete proposal.
   Some reformers have suggested that the central government retain
control over foreign policy and defense. Others have added control
of some industries, overall economic planning and other duties to
the list.
   Landsbergis, asked whether Gorbachev would lift the economic
embargo imposed on Lithuania in April, said, ``The blockade will
not be canceled tomorrow, but the day after tomorrow, we shall
see.''
   Gorbachev cut off shipments of oil and restricted supplies of
natural gas and other raw materials to Lithuania after the republic
refused to repeal laws stemming from its March declaration of
independence.
   The other two Baltic states have taken a less rapid course
toward secession, declaring indefinite transition periods to
independence.
   In an hourlong address to the Supreme Soviet legislature,
broadcast live on Soviet TV, Gorbachev said ``huge results'' were
achieved in arms control at his Washington summit with President
Bush.
   He reported on his talks with Bush on a united Germany joining
NATO. West Germany now belongs to the Western military alliance and
East Germany to Warsaw Pact, an instrument of Soviet domination in
Eastern Europe until last year's string of revolutions.
   Gorbachev said, ``Our position is thus: We could agree to the
joining, if you accept associative participation, the principle of
blocs coming together in conjunction with the unification of
Germany in the process of which mutual obligations are not changed,
neither from the side of West or East Germany, and if
simultaneously the blocs are reformed in natural connection with
Vienna and the all-European process.''
   He did not spell out what associate membership for Germany would
entail. Vienna is the venue for arms reduction talks and the
Europe-wide Conference on Security and Cooperation aimed at
reducing tensions.
   Later, official Radio Moscow said: ``It might be possible to
agree with Germany being in NATO as an associated member provided
there are changes in the nature of the military alliances, both
NATO and the Warsaw Treaty organization.''
   The Soviet president seemed to be demanding that a united
Germany fulfill East Germany's obligations to the Warsaw Pact only
during a transition period.

   Actor Martin Sheen urged a
supermarket chain to boycott Folgers coffee to persuade Procter &amp;
Gamble to stop buying beans from war-torn El Salvador.
   Sheen joined a demonstration Tuesday by about three dozen people
outside a shareholders meeting of the Arden supermarket chain.
   The boycott was started in November by peace organizations to
protest the slayings in El Salvador of six Jesuit priests.
Salvadoran military officers have been implicated in the killings.
   ``My country should not be funding the killers of the Jesuit
priests with our tax dollars or our consumer dollars,'' Sheen said.
   An Arden spokesman, Ernest Klinger, said the company would
continue to stock Folgers to give consumers a full selection.
   Don Tassone of P&amp;G, which makes Folgers, called the boycott
``preposterous.'' He said P&amp;G buys coffee from at least 30
countries, and the Salvadoran product amounts to less than 2
percent of the coffee in Folgers.

   Cal Ripken is in second place behind Lou Gehrig
on baseball's Iron Man list, having notched his 1,308th consecutive
game.
   Ripken moved past Everett Scott on Tuesday when he started at
shortstop for the Baltimore Orioles, as he has every game since May
30, 1982. He needs 822 more games to match Gehrig's record for
consecutive games played.
   ``I try not to think about what has transpired and what could
possibly transpire,'' Ripken said before the game with the
Milwaukee Brewers. ``I think I'll be proud of the accomplishment
but I don't think there will be a real big, special feeling that

   Scott's streak began in 1916 with the Boston Red Sox and ended
in 1925 with the New York Yankees. His fragile knees just wouldn't
let him continue.

   Cajun fiddler-singer Doug Kershaw spent
a few hours in jail before posting $132,000 bail to cover alimony
he allegedly owes his ailing ex-wife.
   Kershaw, the 53-year-old ``ragin' Cajun'' best known for his
1961 song ``Louisiana Man,'' was jailed Friday after performing at
the Tennessee State Fairgrounds. A contempt hearing was set for
July 18.
   Kershaw's former wife, Elsie Griffin Kershaw, 72, is destitute
and in ill health, said her attorney, Jack Norman Jr.
   According to a petition filed by Norman, Kershaw had avoided
payment of $750 a month in alimony when the couple divorced in 1975
after seven years of marriage.
   Kershaw was the featured entertainer at halftime during this
year's Super Bowl in New Orleans.

   East German police have arrested one of West
Germany's most wanted leftist terror suspects, the second such
arrest of an alleged Red Army Faction member in a week, the
government-run news agency said today.
   ADN said Inge Viett, 46, was arrested late Tuesday in the East
German city of Magdeburg.
   She is accused of taking part in the murder of prominent West
Berlin Judge Guenter von Drenkmann in 1974 and the kidnapping a
year later of West Berlin Christian Democratic leader Peter Lorenz.
   In recent days, West German wanted posters had appeared in
Magdeburg, with names and pictures of Ms. Viett and nine other
accused, fugitive terrorists, according to ADN. The posters asked
East Germans who may have seen the suspects to notify authorities.
   Ms. Viett's arrest raised speculation that other members of the
notorious Red Army Faction terror organization will be found in
East Germany, which is in the process of reunifying with West
Germany.
   There has already been speculation that the once-dreaded and now
disbanded East German secret police were involved in harboring West
German terrorists.
   Willi Fundermann, a spokesman for the West German federal police
in Wiesbaden, said Ms. Viett had lived in Magdeburg for more than
two years under the name of Eva Schnell. Before that, she had lived
in Dresden, Fundermann told The Associated Press.
   Another federal police spokesman, Willy Terstiege, said it is
difficult to say whether other West German terrorists are in East
Germany.
   ``There is the possibility that others are there,'' Terstiege
told the AP. ``It's also possible that because of the arrests, any
who may have been there are now trying to leave the country. I
don't know.''
   On Wednesday, East Berlin police arrested Susanne Albrecht,
another suspected Red Army Faction member. She was wanted for the
1977 murder of prominent West German banker Juergen Ponto.
   According to the Morgenpost newspaper of Dresden, suspected West
German terrorist Silke Maier-Witt lived for years in that East
German city. She is suspected of having taken part in the 1977
kidnapping and murder of prominent West German industrialist Hanns
Martin Schleyer.
   There was no official comment on the report about Ms. Maier-Witt.
   ADN said West German police were involved in tracking down Ms.
Viett.
   East German Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel called Ms.
Viett's arrest an example of ``success in German-German
cooperation'' that had already worked in Ms. Albrecht's capture.
   East German law enforcement authorities, speaking to The
Associated Press on the condition of anonymity, say the tip leading
to Ms. Viett's arrest came from her neighbors.
   According to the sources, the neighbors traveled to the West
German city of Braunschweig, about a half-hour's drive from the
East German border, and notified police there. The West German
officials then notified their East German colleagues, according to
the sources.
   Ms. Viett allegedly first became active in leftist terrorism in
1972, when she is accused of having taken part in a bombing in
Berlin that killed one person.

   A study of what's eating Americans has crowned
Eureka, Calif., today as the nation's heartburn capital.
   The National Rolaids Heartburn Index blames that searing
sensation on sociology, not spices. It says Eureka is full of
newcomers with a burning desire for economic success.
   El Paso was named the most heartburn-free city in America,
despite its Tex-Mex cuisine. The reason: a stable population and a
rebounding economy.
   Or ``maybe they're stoics,'' said Jack Levin, sociology
professor at Northeastern University in Boston.
   However, his heartfelt study points to other factors.
   ``I think there is a tendency on the part of Americans to blame
heartburn on spicy foods _ Mexican or Szechuan, for example,'' said
Levin. ``From a sociological standpoint, it appears heartburn
levels can be easily linked to the amount of population growth that
a city is experiencing.''
   To reach his conclusions, Levin digested sales figures for
various antacid brands, tablet and liquid, from 197 metropolitan
areas. Then, he ranked the nation's heartburn hotbeds.
   While the sales statistics were not revealed, he found that, on
average, Americans experience heartburn twice a week. In contrast,
the 25,000 folks in Eureka are plagued an average of four times a
week.
   Other Americans left their heartburn in San Francisco; Chico,
Calif; Santa Barbara, Calif.; Sacramento, Calif.; Boise, Idaho;
Reno, Nevada; Fresno, Calif.; Bakersfield, Calif., and Seattle.
   The happiest tummies were found in El Paso; Fort Smith, Ark.;
Ada, Okla.; Colorado Springs, Colo.; Columbia, Mo.; St. Joseph,
Mo.; Lubbock, Tex.; Panama City, Fla.; Springfield, Mo.; and
Albany, Ga.
   ``The most startling result in this analysis was that the
Northeast region did not have high heartburn on the Rolaids
index,'' said Levin. New York City ranked 135th.
   ``These results say heartburn occurs wherever there's `gold rush
fever,' where you get large numbers of newcomers, transients,
rootless people, who move to an area to make their fortune, for a
new beginning or a last resort.''
   Perhaps to prove a point, Levin and company officials planned to
belch forth their findings at a luncheon of chicken marinaded in
tequila, shrimp marinaded in chilli, salad with cilantro dressing,
tacos and refried beans.
   As a hedge, there'll be ``Rolaids for everyone, if necessary,''
said spokeswoman Ann Forster.
   It wasn't clear whether Eureka citizens were pained by the study
results. However, the mayor planned to be at the luncheon.
   To the 40 million Americans who sometimes suffer from heartburn,
Levin offered this advice:
   ``Avoid a lot of important changes in their lifestyles all at
the same time. Even the most positive changes, like getting
married, moving to a nicer neighborhood, getting a better job, can
create heartburn.''

   Ethnic clashes in the Central Asian republic of
Kirghizia this month have left 148 people dead, the Tass news
agency said today.
   Meanwhile, a top Interior Ministry official said that in two
years of civil strife throughout the Soviet Union _ primarily
ethnic clashes _ 24,000 people have been arrested and 4,000
firearms and 500 explosive devices seized.
   No new outbreaks of violence were reported in western Kirghizia,
where clashes between ethnic Kirghiz and Uzbeks began June 2 over a
land dispute.
   Because the situation has stabilized in recent days, members of
search and rescue teams have been able to make a better accounting
of the dead and injured, Tass said. They said 148 people were
killed and 885 injured in the unrest, Tass reported. Of the
injured, 748 were hospitalized, the agency said.
   In addition, authorities confiscated 230 firearms and 23
incendiary bombs in the region, Tass said.
   The violence stems from a dispute over the allocation of land to
ethnic Kirghiz and Uzbeks, both Sunni Moslems, in the densly
populated region where housing is scarce. It was the latest in a
series of bloody civil conflicts to trouble the government of
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   In Moscow, the Interior Ministry official said on Tuesday that
the ministry's troops were used in 13 regions over the past two
years to quell such outbreaks of violence, the news agency said.
   Maj. Gen. Alexander Grienko, chief of the ministry's Political
Department, told Tass 16 soliders were killed, four were reported
missing and more than 1,000 were wounded. He did not say how many
civilians were killed or injured.
   Besides this month's unrest in Kirghizia and Uzbekistan, ethnic
violence also has occurred in Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan and Tadzhikistan.

   As workers on the hard-roll line at the National
Baking Co., James Street and his friends are used to lots of dough,
but not the kind they won in the Illinois State Lottery.
   The 12 bakery workers _ one shy of a baker's dozen _ stepped
forward Tuesday to claim a grand prize of $25 million. Calling
themselves the Blessed Dozen Partnership, they had pooled $60 for
tickets in Saturday's drawing.
   ``I liked these numbers,'' said Street, 43, who organized the
group about a year ago. ``The numbers just came to me to play. I
knew we'd win.''
   Lottery spokeswoman Julie Lively said the group will receive
$1.25 million annually for 20 years.
   The big bread means some of the dozen will be saying goodbye to
hard rolls.
   Baker Katy Mae Warren, 67, said she would be retiring soon, as
she already had planned. ``I've been there 30 years,'' she said.
   Marshall Guthrie, 36, a dough mixer, remembers dancing around
the baking line when he heard the news. ``Our boss at the bakery
said no one can play the lottery anymore,'' said Guthrie.
   Edgar Harris, 58, who underwent open heart surgery in March,
wasn't even sure he was in on the pool at first. He's been on sick
leave.
   ``They put the money in for me. I know I have two good
friends,'' he said.
   Street, head of the hard-roll production line, said the 12 began
by contributing $2 apiece each week but increased their weekly ante
to $5 in mid-May.

<HEAD>Report: Six Cambodian Officials Held For Trying To Form Rival

<TEXT>
   Authorities in Cambodia have arrested
at least six senior government officials and army officers for
trying to form a rival political party, a U.S. human rights group
said in a statement.
   The group, Asia Watch, said the officials, who included a
Cabinet minister, were arrested between May 21 and May 25 on
suspicion of trying to set up the Liberal Social Democratic Party.
   Cambodia's one-party Communist administration was installed by a
Vietnamese invasion of the country in late 1978. It continues to
fight three guerrilla groups backed by China and other countries.
   The statement, dated Tuesday, said the executive director of
Asia Watch, Sidney Jones, was in the Cambodian capital of Phnom
Penh at the time of the arrests.
   ``This is a major new development in Cambodia,'' it quoted him
as saying. ``Up until now political arrests have been largely
linked to the resistance factions based in Thailand.''
   ``These men were apparently trying to take advantage of a
changed political climate and move Cambodia towards a multiparty
system. It looks like they may have jumped the gun,'' he said.
   The statement said the six men were thought to have been among a
group that included 15 to 40 other people. They six were held in a
villa in the capital, it said. More than one villa in the elite
Tuol Kork district of the capital was known to house political
prisoners, it said.
   The statement identified those arrested as Ung Phan, the
minister of transport, communications and posts; Nou Saing Khan,
the chief of planning and statistics at the same ministry; Kan Man,
the deputy director of the European and American bureau of the
Foreign Ministry; Thun Saray, acting director of the Institute of
Sociology; Col. On Sum of the research department of the Defense
Ministry; and another officer, Lt. Col. Kay Mathury.
   Nou Saing Khan was reported to have drafted the party charter,
which called for a multiparty system, the statement by Asia Watch
said.
   It said Ung Phan was considered a protege of Prime Minister Hun
Sen. Ung Phan was a cabinet minister in 1983 and in 1988 was vice
chairman of Cambodia's only law school, the report said.
   It said that on May 23, an official close to Hun Sen told Asia
Watch that the arrests were a ``mistake'' and the men would be
freed once Hun Sen returned from a visit to Vietnam.
   However, it said, the men remained in detention while Hun Sen
went to Japan for peace talks with guerrilla leader Prince Norodom
Sihanouk. The talks were held June 4-5 and Hun Sen returned to
Phnom Penh on June 10 after stopovers in Moscow and Hanoi.
   Authorities in Phnom Penh have substantially eased political
restrictions in recent years and said they would support a
government along Western democratic lines when peace is achieved
with the guerrillas.
   The Asia Watch statement said the debate over a possible change
to a pluralistic system was thought to have split the government
between a reformist group, led by Hun Sen and one of pro-Vietnamese
hardliners.

<TEXT>
   Workers began tearing down the remainder of
the Berlin Wall today, starting with a street split down the center
that symbolized the city's 29-year division.
   A huge crane smashed into a section of wall built into the
fronts of houses on Bernauer Street in August 1961, when the wall
was put up.
   Bernauer was the scene of the most escapes in the early days of
the wall. Scores of East Germans tumbled through windows and off
rooftops as the wall was gradually built higher and windows were
cemented shut.
   ``I am full of hatred for that symbol of division,'' said East
German Building Minister Ekkehard Kraft as hundreds of people
gathered to watch the ceremonial start of the destruction.
   The decision to begin final demolition of the wall came Tuesday,
in the first joint session of the city councils of both Berlins.
   ``We are already now one city,'' said East Berlin Mayor Tino
Schwierzina, who was elected in East Germany's first free local
balloting in May.
   One section of wall is to remain standing as a memorial to the
people who were killed trying to flee from East Germany to the West.
   The demolition is to be completed by July 2, when the two German
states are to merge their economies in the major step to full
unification.
   The meeting of the West Berlin Senate and the East Berlin
Magisrat was the first involving local officials from both Berlins
since 1948, after Germany and its capital were both carved in two
by the victorious World War II Allies.
   The two councils, which meet individually each week, plan to
meet jointly every two weeks until full unification takes place and
a single government is chosen in new local elections.
   East Germany's former Communist government was toppled by mass
protests in October and the wall was opened in November. Since
then, Germans have been able to pass back and forth between the
cities and the two nations.
   Border crossings still are staffed by guards on both sides of
the wall and cursory passport checks are made. Foreigners can pass
only through two points.
   Some of the most famous stretches of the Berlin Wall have
already been demolished, but most of the wall still snakes around
West Berlin.
   Berlin was divided into four sectors following World War II,
with the Soviets in control of the East and France, Britain and the
United States in control of the West.
   East Berlin is the capital of East Germany, but West Berlin is
still technically under military occupation and not part of the
territory of West Germany.
   The four Allies are expected to negotiate an end to their direct
involvement in the cities during the series of ongoing talks that
also are dealing with the future strategic allegiance of a united
Germany.

   Demonstrators halted traffic in much of
the capital today to protest the apparent victory of the heirs to
the long-ruling Communists in Bulgaria's first free elections in 58
years.
   The protesters formed barricades with benches, blocking traffic
on main thoroughfares, including an intersection demonstrators had
blocked for several hours Tuesday night. Some threatened drivers
who did not honk their horns.
   Honking has become a common expression of protest over the past
few days against the Socialist Party, known until April as the
Communist Party.
   With half the official results tallied, the Socialists appeared
to have won the first round of voting on Sunday, but final results
were not expected before tonight, an election official said.
   Runoffs are being held Sunday in 81 constituencies where no
single candidate received the required majority.
   Analysts said that based on the known results and projections by
West German and Bulgarian groups, it was still possible that the
opposition could gain a slight edge after the second-round voting.
   But the official BTA news agency said the opposition would have
to win nearly all the seats at stake in the runoffs.
   Half of Parliament's 400 seats are being filled by direct
election, the other 200 based on the percentage of votes each party
receives.
   Supporters of the 16-party opposition alliance, the Union of
Democratic Forces, and of an anarchist group say Sunday's elections
were manipulated, but most foreign observers said they saw little
or no wrongdoing.
   The opposition pledged Tuesday to rally behind candidates not
associated with the Socialist Party in the runoffs in 81
constituencies, in a last-ditch bid to gain control of Parliament.
   According to final results for the individual constituencies
released by the Central Election Commission today, the Socialist
Party won 75 seats outright in the first round.
   Union of Democratic Forces candidates won in 32 constituences
and the mostly ethnic-Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms won
in nine more, state radio reported. Three more seats went to an
independent and one each to two small opposition parties.
   On Tuesday, students began a three-day protest strike at Kliment
Ohridski University, protesting the authorities' delay in releasing
election returns. But the students distanced themselves from
Tuesday's demonstration at the intersection.
   Traffic was halted today on the entire 2.5-mile Lenin Boulevard,
the main artery leading into downtown Sofia. Angry citizens had to
walk for miles to get to their jobs.
   The demonstration Tuesday night lasted into the morning hours,
when police pushed the demonstrators back and a heavy downpour
reduced their numbers.
   ``Long Live Anarchy, Long Live Freedom,'' shouted the crowd.
Many of the demonstrators were of high school age.
   The late-night protest extended to nearby television
headquarters, where protesters claimed that TV director Pavel
Pisarev had manipulated election coverage.
   Socialist leaders say they would like to share power, but may be
faced with forming a single-party government. The party then would
have to tackle alone the country's deepening economic crisis,
including rising inflation, a $10 billion foreign debt and consumer
shortages.
   The Union of Democratic Forces favors faster reforms toward a
Western-style market economy than the Socialists' cautious approach.
   The strong Socialist showing seemed due in part to its
near-century as a political presence in Bulgaria. Another possible
factor was the popularity of some current Socialist leaders, who
figured prominently in ousting hard-line Communist strongman Todor
Zhivkov last November and initiating reform in the country _ one of
Moscow's closest allies during the Brezhnev era.

<HEAD>Mail-Order Bride Business Outlawed in Philippines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino today signed
a bill banning the ``pernicious trade'' in mail-order brides, which
she said insults national pride and breaks the hearts of young
women and their families.
   Mrs. Aquino hailed the new law's prohibition of the ``commerce
in women under the guise of legitimate marriage.''
   The measure outlaws the ``solicitation or inducement'' of
Filipino women to become members of any club or association whose
objective is to match women for marriage to foreign nationals _
either on a mail-order basis or through personal introductions for
a fee.
   It also bans the printing and distribution of material promoting
the practice. Violators could face up to eight years in jail and
$870 in fines.
   ``The mail-order bride (business) is a relatively new phenomenon
in our society, but its perpetrators are many,'' said Mrs. Aquino.
``They are able to carry out their pernicious trade through the use
of the media ... for personal profit.''
   Mrs. Aquino said many poor young women from remote villges are
lured ``through sweet talk and grandiose promises'' by the
mail-order bride businesses.
   ``Although we come by success stories every so often, most of
the feedback is devastating not only to individual persons and
families but also to our national pride,'' she said.
   Sen. Ernesto Maceda, the chief congressional sponsor of the new
law, said he was spurred to action by the ``alarming rate'' of
battered Filipino wives married to foreign nationals through the
mail-order bride business.
   Any foreigner convicted under the new law faces the same fine
and jail time, plus deportation afterward. Violators are barred
permanantly from returning to the Philippines.

<HEAD>US Training of Lebanese Military May Resume</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is prepared to resume
a military training program for Lebanon once that country pays off
more than $8 million in overdue loans to the United States, U.S.
officials said today.
   John Kelly, assistant secretary of state for Near East and South
Asian Affairs, outlined the U.S. position last week at a meeting in
Egypt with Lebanese President Elias Harawi, the officials said.
   Under law, Lebanon is ineligible for U.S. assistance because of
the repayment arrearages. The suspell ahead of the schedule set in a U.S.-Soviet
treaty
signed during the superpower summit.
   The agreement signed by President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev requires each side to reduce its stockpile to
5,000 tons by 2002, although the Soviets have no active facility
for destroying their weapons.
   The United States says it has about 25,000 tons of chemical
agents; the Soviets say they have 50,000 tons. The two nations are
the world's largest holders of such weapons.
   Destruction is supposed to begin by Dec. 31, 1992, but doubts
have arisen over the Soviets' plans because the government last
summer shut down its only destruction facility, at Chapayevsk on
the Volga River, because of environmental protests.
   The GAO report raises serious questions about whether the United
States will meets its goal.
   ``As we try and rid ourselves of this dangerous legacy, we learn
that the Army is behind schedule and over budget by billions,''
said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., one of three lawmakers to request
the GAO report.
   ``In short, with this effort the environment loses, the federal
budget loses and the American taxpayer loses.''
   The Army said late Tuesday it had not seen the report and had no
immediate comment.
   The GAO said the Army believes it will fall short of the April
30, 1997, deadline due to problems at the Johnston Atoll facility.
The agency also cited growing community opposition as a factor in
delaying the Army's schedule.
   The Johnston Atoll plant in the Pacific Ocean was built to meet
a 1985 congressional requirement to destroy all existing U.S.
chemical weapons by 1997 as a condition for approving a Pentagon
program to produce a new generation of such weapons.
   The Army announced in 1988 that it planned to build similar
disposal facilities at each of the eight chemical munitions storage
sites in the continental United States.
   The sites are Tooele, Utah; Anniston, Ala.; Pine Bluff, Ark.;
Umatilla, Ore.; Pueblo, Colo.; Newport, Ind.; Lexington-Blue Grass,
Ky.; and Aberdeen, Md.
   The GAO report said the Army did not expect restrictions imposed
by a Utah environmental permit that require the service
periodically to operate the disposal plant at 50 percent capacity
while environmental test data is analyzed.
   In addition, purchasing of equipment for the Utah plant was
delayed by a $37 million shortfall in funds for fiscal 1990.
   Meanwhile, the GAO found that at Johnston Atoll,``operational
delays at the initial plant have adversely affected the Army's
ability to incorporate lessons learned at this plant into the
design and construction plans for the continental U.S. disposal
facilities.''
   The GAO also said the Army will likely face obstacles in
obtaining environmental permits, and community opposition in
Indiana, Kentucky and Maryland will put the Army's disposal
schedule in jeopardy.
   The GAO said the Army received information in March 1988 that
showed the total disposal program will cost $3.4 billion _ double
the October 1985 estimate for destroying the weapons at the eight
storages sites and Johnston Atoll.
   But the GAO report said the total cost likely will increase
because ``current construction, equipment and personnel
requirements are at least $300 million greater than estimated in
March 1988.''
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, said the ``great irony here is that we
developed these weapons because they promised deterrence on the
cheap, but we never took into account the clean-up, disposal and
environmental costs incurred by manufacturing these weapons.''
   Rep. Earl Hutto, D-Fla., chairman of the House Armed Services
subcommittee on readiness, also requested the report. Glenn is
chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee while Conyers
is chairman of the House Committee on Government Operations.

<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Islamic fundamentalist leader
demanded today that the government dissolve Parliament and hold
early national elections after his followers beat the ruling party
in local balloting.
   Abassi Madani, president of the Islamic Salvation Front, thanked
the government for allowing Algeria's first multiparty elections
since independence in 1962. But he said Parliament, in which every
seat is held by the ruling National Liberation Front, should be
dissolved to clear the way for legislative elections within three
months. There was no immediate government response.
   By midafternoon today, no official results had been announced,
but Interior Minister Mohamed-Salah Mohammedi said Madani's party
won a majority of the 15,000 seats at stake Tuesday on 1,541
municipal and 48 provincial councils. About 13 million people were
registered to vote.
   The voter turnout was about 60 percent because of a boycott by
several parties opposed to the government and the fundamentalists.
In a constitutional referendum last year, the turnout was 76
percent.
   Mohammedi said the fundamentalists were followed closely by the
National Liberation Front and the anti-clerical Rally for Culture
and Democracy.
   In France, Algeria's former colonial ruler and home to hundreds
of thousands of Algerian immigrants, Youth and Sports Minister
Roger Bambuck indicated the results would cause alarm in government
ranks.
   ``It's with great sadness that I see the rise of fundamentalists
in Algeria,'' he said in a radio interview. ``Every time one sees
dogmatism on the rise, whether political or religious, it's liberty
that is in danger.''
   He said the results ``will be a source of worry for Algerians
and will create difficulties for our Algerian friends living in
France.''
   In Iran, state-run Tehran Radio said the results were ``part of
the wave of Islamization that has gripped northern African nations
simultaneously.''
   ``The development of Islamic feeling in these countries is
similar to Algeria, but it is suppressed by the ruling regimes,''
the radio said.
   In Tunisia, one of Algeria's neighbors, the main Islamic group
was barred from nationwide local elections Sunday.
   Algeria's National Liberation Front was the sole political party
in the nation of 24 million people until constitutional changes in
February 1989 opened the way to competing parties.
   Centrist opposition leaders had feared the election would be
rigged because the National Liberation Front controlled nearly all
media, had greater resources and had functionaries in local offices
where votes were counted.
   Madani, a 59-year-old philosophy professor, thanked the public
and government for the ``high level of political maturity'' that
led to his party's majority. The electorate ``knew how to choose
its destiny by showing a profound confidence in us,'' he said.
   The Islamic Salvation Front seeks to establish the Islamic legal
code, the Sharia, as law. But Madani said he was prepared to
cooperate with other factions and did not favor a one-party state.
   ``We guarantee the freedom of all who have ideas on Algeria's
future,'' he said. ``The Algerian people are not stupid. They can
tell truth from error.''
   For months, fundamentalist supporters have been accused of
harassing single women and disrupting nightclubs in Algiers.
   In the Algiers suburb of El Harrach, the National Liberation
Front withdrew from the elections, accusing the fundamentalists of
``exercising moral violence against the voters.'' The statement did
not elaborate.

   The nation's largest Protestant denomination
is firmly in fundamentalist hands after moderates were easily
defeated in what many considered their last chance for the
presidency of the Southern Baptists.
   The Rev. Morris Chapman of Wichita Falls, Texas, the
fundamentalist candidate, won 58 percent of the vote Tuesday in
defeating the Rev. Daniel Vestal of suburban Atlanta, 21,471 to
15,753.
   ``I trust that after 12 consecutive years, we can consider the
issue settled. For a lot of us are weary,'' said Chapman, who won
by the largest margin will happen in most churches is a kind of
general attrition'' of support for the national denomination, said
the Rev. Dan Scott of Fort Oglethorpe, Ga. ``I call it a return to
localism.''
   The Southern Baptist Alliance predicts there will be greater
support for their plans for a moderate seminary in Richmond, Va.
Hastey said the group has raised about $600,000 of the $1 million
it needs to open.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Dave Durenberger made an emotional plea
to the Senate ethics committee today, saying his ``life and
reputation'' are at stake and asking for compassion in their
judgment of his financial dealings.
   In an intensely personal statement, the Minnesota Republican
said repeatedly he was ``deeply sorry'' for financial deals that he
admitted violated Senate rules.
   The committee's special counsel, Robert Bennett, recommended
Tuesday that the Senate publicly denounce Durenberger for
``reprehensible'' actions that brought ``dishonor and disrepute''
on the Senate.
   ``His conduct was clearly and unequivocally unethical,'' Bennett
told the committee after describing allegations that Durenberger
broke Senate rules and federal law through a book promotion deal
and transactions involving his Minneapolis condominium.
   Durenberger made no reference to the proposed sanction in a
13-page statement prepared for the committee today. Repeating that
he was sorry for his actions four times, Durenberger described how
he had thrown himself into his work because of the emotional trauma
from his first wife's death and the ``daunting challenge'' of
raising four young sons.
   ``My life and reputation are at stake, and I believe each of you
will combine both good judgment and compassion in your decision,''
Durenberger said.
   Durenberger said he would not challenge the committee's
recommended punishment, but he appeared to rule out resigning from
the Senate. ``When this is done, I intend to serve this body and my
home state with a renewed conviction to exemplify the servant in
public service,'' he said.
   Durenberger's attorney, Jim Hamilton, told the committee today
that Durenberger's conduct was not ``reprehensible'' and the
senator does not deserve a sanction as harsh as a resolution
denouncing him.
   He said reprehensible conduct ``conjures up venality'' and
``Dave Durenberger is not an evil, reprehensible man.''
   He told the committee that Durenberger was undergoing ``personal
strain and impaired judgment'' during a number of the questionable
financial transactions, including marital problems, chemical
dependency of two sons and severe financial strains.
   Hamilton told the panel Tuesday that ``Durenberger feels that
some sanction is appropriate because he was inattentive and
unwise.''
   Only the full Senate can decide to punish one of its members. If
the committee and the Senate followed the counsel's recommendation,
a resolution would be passed denouncing Durenberger's conduct, but
his position as a senator _ at least until his next re-election
campaign _ would not be affected.
   A less-severe penalty, such as admonishing or reprimanding
Durenberger, would not require Senate approval, Bennett said.
   Bennett reminded the panel it could consider stripping
Durenberger of his seniority and committee assignments as well as
order him to make restitution.
   He said the most serious punishment, expulsion, traditionally
has been reserved for senators guilty of serious violations of the
law.
   The counsel said Durenberger was guilty of a ``pattern of
misconduct.''
   Hamilton portrayed Durenberger as a victim of mistakes and
sloppiness who relied on a ``bevy of lawyers'' to handle his
finances. There were no ``venal motives'' or a ``grand conspiracy''
to violate the rules.
   Bennett accused Durenberger of making fake promotional
appearances in 1985 and 1986 for his two books so he could keep
more speaking fees than allowed.
   The speeches were ``a gimmick'' to ``magically'' turn honoraria
earned from appearances before trade groups into book promotions,
allowing Durenberger to make $100,000 above his Senate salary,
Bennett said.
   Durenberger received the money from a Minneapolis publisher,
Piranha Press, in return for having trade groups he addressed send
their speaking fees to Piranha. Piranha earned $248,360 from the
speeches but only $15,560 from sales of the two books.
   ``This very hungry fish, Piranha Press, was allowed to engage in
a feeding frenzy'' to make money, Bennett said. Durenberger, he
added, ``allowed himself and his office to be used as the bait and
he got $100,000 for his trouble.''
   Durenberger's attempts to change ownership of his Minneapolis
condominium were part of a convoluted scheme to collect $40,055 in
Senate travel reimbursements improperly from 1983 through 1989. He
knew he would have been ineligible for the payments if he had owned
the residence outright, Bennett said.
   Bennett also said Durenberger showed a ``pattern of
insensitivity'' when he accepted free limousine rides in Boston
from people interested in legislation. Durenberger used the
limousine service to get to regular appointments with a local
marriage counselor.

   Police wanted to pull the plug on a
party of underage drinkers, so they pulled the trigger at their keg.
   ``Better to do that than leave it full and have 35 to 40
juveniles running around drunk,'' Police Chief Dennis Robertson
said Tuesday.
   Police were called Sunday about a keg party involving minors in
this town of 3,300 near Kansas City, Kan. Just two officers were on
duty and they had two other calls which they had to respond to,
Robertson said.
   ``There was nobody around and nobody to get hurt,'' Robertson
said, and because of the other calls, an officer decided to fire
his gun into the keg of beer, draining it.
   No arrests were made.
   If the officers had had time, they would have taken the keg to a
chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, so the group could get
the keg deposit, Robertson said.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet government said today that it would
postpone unpopular bread price increases, but lawmakers were
considering a plan to speed up other elements of a radical economic
reform plan.
   Bread prices will be raised, but ``of course, not by July 1'' as
originally planned, a top official said. When plans to raise the
price of bread and other food and goods were announced last month,
they set off a wave of panic buying.
   The official _ Yuri Maslyukov, chairman of the government agency
that plans the centralized economy _ spoke with reporters during a
break at a session of the Supreme Soviet legislature.
   Lawmakers were debating a resolution on the economic program
presented last month by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov. The resolution
calls for faster and more radical steps to make the switch from
central planning to a market economy.
   ``We can't stretch the elastic..., we have to begin work now,''
Alexei Boiko, chairman of an economic reform commission, told
parliamentary deputies, urging the speeding up of the program.
   The draft resolution would instruct the government to cut
spending immediately on the military and the state bureaucracy.
   It would also give the government until September to make
concrete proposals for faster economic reforms, including drafting
laws on creation of a stock market, commercial banks and credit and
a federal reserve bank.
   But opposition surfaced during debate, and the resolution was
likely to change drastically by day's end.
   Ryzhkov, the economic plan's architect, told reporters he
supported the resolution. ``The project was worked on by
commissions and is fairly objective, and allows us to work
further,'' he said. But he said it would be difficult to complete
all the laws and practical measures by the autumn deadline.
   Today's proposal did not address the Ryzhkov plan's price
increases for most consumer products, which are due to take effect
in January. The Ryzhkov plan was criticized for raising prices
without freeing enough goods and prices from government control to
allow a true transition to a market economy.
   Particularly unpopular was the proposal to at least double the
price of bread, the staple of the Soviet diet. Currently, bread is
extremely cheap at about 30 cents a loaf.
   Ryzhkov admitted he was surprised at the swell of sentiment
against the price increases. He said he knew it would be difficult,
but ``to tell the truth, I thought society was more prepared.''
   Maslyukov said the plan for bread prices increases, which would
be linked to compensation for the public, needed more work. But he
said nine of the 15 Soviet republics had already agreed to raise
their bread prices on August 1, with compensation beginning about
two weeks earlier.

<DATELINE>MANNHEIM, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West German businessman
testified today that the company he once ran helped build a
chemical weapons factory in Libya, West German television reported.
   Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen, former director of the
Imhausen-Chemie company of Lahr, also said at his trial that the
Rabta plant in Libya was built to make poison gas, the television
news said.
   According to the news report, Hippenstiel said the company
``participated in construction of the Rabta factory,'' delivering
production plans and equipment.
   Hippenstiel said the project began in 1984 when a ``middleman,''
whom he did not identify by name, contacted him to build a chemical
plant to make ``pharmaceuticals and insecticides.''
   A short time later he was made aware that the $136.4 million
project was intended to be set up in Libya, Hippenstiel said.
   He said he had suspicions that the project ``would be in
conflict with export laws,'' but that he had purposely not checked
it out because he ``didn't want to lose the business.''
   Hippenstiel apologized that he had caused West Germany what he
called ``diplomatic problems,'' because of the deal with Libya.
   ``The responsibility and overall management was in my hands,''
Hippenstiel said of the project.
   The television news said: ``Hippenstiel's statements also
confirmed that poison gas was to be produced at Rabta.''
   Hippenstiel said he did not pay taxes on $11.7 million on
profits from his transactions. He said, however, that he used the
money for the Rabta project to ensure it would be completed.He did
not elaborate.
   The Libyan plant scandal broke in December 1988, with
allegations of West German assistance in construction of the plant
south of Tripoli.
   West German government officials at first denied any of the
country's companies were involved, but later acknowledged the
allegations were true.
   Libya says the plant was built to make pharmaceuticals only.
   Hippenstiehl-Imhausen headed the company that allegedly was the
key supplier of equipment and expertise.
   The 49-year-old defendant was held in prison for 14 months until
his trial began Monday in Mannheim District Court.
   A 100-page indictment alleged that Hippenstiehl-Imhausen played
a leading role in the project from 1984 to 1988, when he headed the
Imhausen Chemie chemical company.
   In opening arguments, prosecutor Hans-Heiko Klein said
Hippenstiel-Imhausen had delivered plans and documents, as well as
providing material valued at $12 million.
   The primary allegations against the defendant revolved around
violations of West German export laws, designed to hinder any
participation in such illegal projects abroad.
   Next week, the court will hear witnesses called to testify in
the case.

<HEAD>Mrs. Bush Endorses Call for Flag-Burning Amendment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush today endorsed her husband's call
for a constitutional amendment against flag burning, but retired
Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren E. Burger took an equivocal
position.
   President Bush is pressing for a 27th amendment to the
Constitution to make flag-burning a crime. The Supreme Court has
overturned laws against flag desecration, ruling they violate the
First Amendment's protection of free speech.
   The first lady, asked her view on amending the Constitution,
said, ``I'm with the president on that. ... You're darn right, I'm
always with the president. I'm glad you noticed.''
   Reporters then tried to get an opinion from the 82-year-old
Burger, who led the high court in 1969-1986 and has often cautioned
against adding amendments to the Constitution. Burger and Mrs. Bush
were meeting on the White House lawn with students who won a poster
contest honoring the Constitution.
   ``Retired justices shouldn't have any thoughts as to what
present justices should do, but I won't wrap myself in that flag
because I might be afraid to get burned,'' Burger said.
   When a reporter pressed for an explanation, Mrs. Bush
interjected, ``That's a pun, you dummy.''
   ``I don't have a vote anymore. ... '' said Burger. ``Last year's
coach shouldn't be telling the football coach how he should run the
team this year.''
   Burger is chairman of the Commission on the Bicentennial of the
U.S. Constitution, which honored several dozen students from three
schools for drawing historical maps of colonial America. More than
6,000 schools entered the contest.
   When reporters asked the students if they believed flag burning
should be allowed, they chorused, ``No!'' No one disagreed.
   ``Thataway!'' said Mrs. Bush.
   The winners were 35 fifth graders from the King's Academy in
West Palm Beach, Fla.; 20 seventh and eighth graders from St.
Andrews School in Tipton, Mo., and Be Do, 16, a junior at Long
Beach High School in Long Beach, Miss.
   Ms. Do and her family fled Vietnam in a small boat in 1979 when
she was 5 and later emigrated to the United States. Her father is a
shrimper in Biloxi, Miss.
   The teen-ager said she spent most of the month of December
drawing her map, ``The Growth of a Nation,'' which featured
colorful geographical and historical pictures inset in each of the
original colonies.
   ``I remember the first time I left Vietnam that I didn't want to
leave it,'' the teen-ager said. ``I kept on saying, `I want to go
back! I want to go back!' But since I've been here I've regretted
ever saying that. It was such a big change.''
   Mrs. Bush held up her map and asked, ``You did that by yourself?
Beautiful.''

   A judge has decided against allowing live TV
coverage of the Central Park rape trial, which began today with
jury selection.
   On Tuesday, Justice Thomas Galligan also banned audio coverage,
citing the ``lewd and scandalous matters'' to be dealt with,
witnesses' apprehensions, the ages of the defendants and the
opposition of both prosecution and defense.
   Lawyers in the trial of three teen-agers accused of raping and
nearly killing a jogger believe it will be impossible to find
potential jurors who have not heard of the highly publicized case.
   About 500 prospective jurors were expected to go through an
initial screening process today at Manhattan's state Supreme Court.
Lawyers will try to pick 12 jurors and six alternates to hear the
cases against Antron McCray and Yusef Salaam, both 16, and Raymond
Santana, 15.
   They and three other youths are charged with attacking an
investment banker while she was jogging through the northern end of
Central Park shortly before 10 p.m. on April 19, 1989.
   More than 30 youths had entered the park's north end together
for what they called ``wilding'' _ a violent rampage. They split up
into smaller groups and allegedly attacked two male joggers, a
homeless man, and the female jogger, who was gang-raped and left
for dead.
   The three youths are being tried as adults on charges of
attempted murder, rape, sodomy, sexual abuse, assault, robbery and
riot. If convicted they would be sentenced as juveniles and would
face a maximum of three and one-third to 10 years in prison.
   The victim, now 29, suffered brain damage in the assault and
cannot remember the attack or identify her assailants. After
emerging from a coma and living at a rehabilitation center, she
returned to work at Salomon Brothers and was recently named a vice
president.

   A tornado swept across a southern
Philippine village, killing up to 30 people and leveling scores of
homes made from coconut leaves, officials said Wednesday. More than
50 people were reported wounded.
   The twister roared ashore ``like a thousand barrels of water
being poured into the village,'' said Ceasar Binghay, budget
officer of Manukan, a village about 450 miles south of Manila.
   The tornado, which hit Tuesday, leveled 59 houses, mostly made
from coconut leaves, and carried people, plants and animals to sea,
Binghay said. He said at least 30 people were reported killed and
50 were wounded.
   Only nine of the dead have been identified, Binghay told
reporters in Dipolog, a town about 15 miles from Manukan.
   The Red Cross and other relief agencies in Manila said they have
not received any report about the incident.
   Sgt. Ramon Aucena of the military's Office of Civil Defense said
his office has received a sketchy report about ``heavy flooding''
in the Manukan area but there was no mention of a tornado.
   The report said about 30 people were either reported dead or
missing in the incident but his office is still verifying the
report, Aucena added.
   Complete reports of natural disasters often take days or weeks
to reach Manila because of the Philippines' primitive
communications system.

   Two gunmen posing as mailmen on
Wednesday killed a former police official in his home, the police
chief said. An outlawed leftist group claimed responsibility.
   The killing was the second in 24 hours claimed by extreme
leftists.
   Hamdi Ardali, the chief of Istanbul police, said the gunmen rang
the doorbell of Muhsin Bodur's house. They told his wife, who
answered the door, they had a personal delivery for him.
   When Bodur, a former police official turned private detective,
came to the door they shot him and ran away, Ardali told reporters.
   Later, the killing was claimed in phone calls to newspaper
offices by Turkish Workers and Peasants Communist Army, an extreme
leftist gang involved in political killings in 1970s.
   Police officials who asked for anonymity said Bodur had tried to
track down members of the leftist group before he left the force.
   On Wednesday, a retired military judge, Durmus Aksen, was shot
and killed in his law office. The shooting was claimed by Dev-Sol
(Revolutionary Left), another underground organization active
during the 1970s.
   Police said Aksen served as legal adviser to the Istanbul
martial law command during 1980-83 military rule.
   The military takeover followed a wave of political violence by
extreme leftist and rightist gangs which claimed 5,000 lives in
three years.
   The military declared martial law nationwide. About 250,000
people were imprisoned on charges of terrorist killings or
affiliation with one of the terrorist groups.
   Most of those imprisoned have been released.

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's Supreme Court accepted new evidence
Wednesday that the defense contends will support convicted Nazi war
criminal John Demjanjuk's assertion that he was a victim of
mistaken identity.
   Demjanjuk, a retired Cleveland autoworker, is appealing his
April 1988 conviction and death sentence.
   The justices admitted into evidence two affidavits from a former
guard in the World War II death camp in Poland in which he stated
that another Ukrainian named Ivan Marchenko was posted with him
there.
   A man named Ivan Marchenko also is on a list from the Main
Commission for Investigation of Hitlerite Crimes in Poland
containing the names of some Soviet prisoners of war who
volunteered to join the Nazis as guards. The court also accepted
that list.
   Demjanjuk's defense lawyer, Yoram Sheftel, contends Marchenko,
not Demjanjuk, is ``Ivan the Terrible,'' a gas-chamber operator at
Treblinka who tortured Jews as they were herded in to die.
   A week before the appeal hearing began May 14, the justices
accepted testimony from a defense witness who identified Marchenko
as Ivan the Terrible. The deposition came from Kaziemiez Dudek, a
liquor store owner whose wife was a prostitute who slept with Ivan
the Terrible.
   Dudek identified Ivan the Terrible from a 1942 photograph that
prosecutors allege is of Demjanjuk but said his surname was
Marchenko.
   ``These things are unequivocal. They speak for themselves,''
argued Sheftel. ``When they come and say Ivan the Terrible was
Marchenko... the case is over.''
   Marchenko is Demjanjuk's mother's maiden name, which prosecutors
claim Demjanjuk used when visiting Dudek's wife. Demjanjuk
Americanized his first name to John from the Ukrainian Ivan in 1958
when he became a U.S. citizen.
   A three-judge trial court agreed with the prosecution that
Demjanjuk was the Treblinka guard. More than 850,000 Jews were
murdered at the Treblinka death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland in
1942-1943.
   A Ukrainian native, Demjanjuk claims he is a victim of mistaken
identity and says he spent those years in several German POW camps
as a captured Soviet soldier. The 70-year-old Demjanjuk was
extradited from Ohio to Israel in February 1986.
   Chief Justice Meir Shamgar pressed Sheftel on the significance
of the different names in comparison with the identification by
Treblinka survivors of photographs of Demjanjuk.
   Justice Eliezer Goldberg also questioned the importance of
evidence coming more than two years after the trial ended.
   ``Today 100 witnesses could come here and tell stories,'' he
said.

   Authorities detained four people,
including a relative of a presidential aide, in an alleged bribery
scandal involving the sale of 2.5 million black socks to the army,
officials said Wednesday.
   Another of the four detained, socks supplier Hsiao Chun-liang,
claims he paid $190,000 in bribes last year to win the $1.82
million contract, authorities said.
   Hsiao also told investigators he paid about $218,000 to three
officers of the Combined Service Forces, an agency overseeing
military purchases, to accept a shipment of inferior socks.
   Hsiao claimed it is difficult for Taiwan factories to meet some
military standards, including one that requires black socks not
fade after soaking in hot water for 40 minutes.
   Newspapers report Premier Hau Pei-tsun ordered an inquiry into
the case after opposition legislators accused the military of a
cover-up.
   In addition to Hsiao, authorities have detained Chiang
Chung-lien, a cousin of the chief of staff to President Lee
Teng-hui, and Chiang's son, Ching-hsiung. Also taken into custody
was Tsai Hsiung, head of the National Assembly's public relations
department.
   Police allege the bribe money was shared by three of the
detained men and other government and military officials.

<HEAD>Human Rights Group Urges Halt to Forced Return of Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The forced return of Burmese refugees
to their homeland was condemned Wednesday by a human rights group
urging a halt to the deportations.
   The U.S.-based Asia Watch organization requested President Bush
to demand an end to Thailand's repatriation policy. The group
claims some Burmese returnees are unwillingly pressed into military
service and could be used as ``human mine sweepers.''
   Thailand's prime minister, Chatichai Choonhavan, is scheduled to
meet with Bush on Thursday in Washington.
   Thai police and troops last week forced about 1,000 Burmese
civilians living in northwestern Thailand to cross the Moei River
back into Burma.
   Thai officials have said there is no danger for most refugees to
return to Burma since democratic reforms were endorsed in the
nation's first free elections in 30 years. But there are still
doubts whether the military will abide by the May 27 election
results.
   ``The Thai government appears to be cynically exploiting the
results of Burma's elections in order to rid itself of a swelling
population of refugees who have fled Burma in fear of their
lives,'' said the statement, seen Wednesday in Bangkok.
   Several minority groups in the rugged northern frontier area
have been fighting the central Rangoon government for autonomy for
the past three decades.
   The Asia Watch statement said there was ``no evidence that army
soldiers have halted their systematic violations of human rights.''
The group cited reports that Thai police had burned the homes and
belongings of those deported.
   By late Friday, Burmese authorities had received 766 people
repatriated from Thailand, said government spokesman Kyaw Sann.
   He said there were 27 camps along the border to receive the
returnees, and those resettled would be given plots of land.
   But the Asia Watch statement said the returnees had been
``imprisoned in monasteries and temple compounds,'' and only those
with identity cards and able to pay $150 were freed.
   Others were forced into military service, acting as porters or
leading patrols through mine-filled areas, the group charges.
   ``Civilian porters compelled to serve as human mine sweepers for
the army have offered numerous testimonies concerning the reckless
disregard for human life routinely exhibited by the Burmese army,''
it added.
   Several human right organizations have accused the Burmese army
of murdering and abusing those it has pressed into its service.

   Hours after oil began spewing from a burning
supertanker in the Gulf of Mexico, scientists in a windowless ``war
room'' 2,000 miles away scrambled to provide fast answers to
salvage crews on the scene.
   Whenever poisonous, explosive or otherwise dangerous substances
are released into the nation's waters, telephones start ringing at
the Hazardous Materials Response Branch.
   ``We are by far and away the most experienced group in oil spill
response worldwide. No question,'' said Dave Kennedy, chief of
scientific support coordinators at the war room, which is the
Western regional headquarters of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.
   As fires raged aboard the Mega Borg off Texas on Saturday, the
research unit was already providing cleanup and Coast Guard crews
with vital data predicting the course and effects of a slick from
the Norwegian supertanker.
   Two oceanographer-modelers were sent to Galveston to study
currents and meteorological factors; three experts from Columbia,
S.C., assessed hazards to seafood, beachgoers and shipping, and two
Louisiana State University chemists analyzed the makeup of the
vessel's cargo of light crude.
   Tomes of information were being sifted by two information
management specialists. And a media specialist was sent to
Galveston on Tuesday to field questions from reporters.
   Before the research unit was formed 14 years ago, the Coast
Guard and cleanup contractors were deluged with raw information
``and in many cases had no idea how to interpret it,'' Kennedy said.
   ``We're here basically to provide a formal mechanism for
transferring scientific information to the operational response
guys, the Coast Guard.''
   The hazardous-response team must answer a vast array of
questions:
   _ Where would oil go if the vessel broke apart or sank? How much
would drift to the bottom? How much would stay at the surface? How
much would be carried by currents beneath the surface?
   _ What threat would the oil pose to shrimp, oysters, mussels and
fish? What would be the best way to minimize the damage? Would
containment booms do any good? If so, where should they be placed?
   _ How much air pollution has occurred? What is the danger to
Corpus Christi, Galveston and other populated areas along the coast?
   _ What should be done about shipping traffic in the area?
   While the threat of a catastrophic spill receded today, the
research unit still had plenty on its mind, including spills in the
Arthur Kill waterway between New York and New Jersey, Buzzards Bay
in Massachusetts and the Connecticut River in Connecticut.
   The Seattle control room is equipped with nautical charts and
topographic maps for every coastline and major inland waterway.
There's a large map on one wall dotted with markings for offshore
oil and gas drilling rigs, weather monitoring platforms and buoys,
the latest location of the burning ship and the outer limits of the
slick.
   On a nearby bookshelf is an atlas listing shellfish and wetland
areas, industrial and shipping sites, bathing beaches and other
shoreline assets.
   ``This is what we call our war room,'' Kennedy said.
   ``I worked about 18 hours yesterday. You worked, what, about 24
hours?'' he said to a woman poring over computer printouts.
   The unit has grown from 10 people in 1976 to 60 today, including
about 35 specialists ready to fly out at any moment and eight
regional coordinators stationed around the country.
   Practically every available staffer was assigned to Prince
William Sound after the Exxon Valdez tanker hit a reef and spilled
nearly 11 million gallons of heavy crude oil in 1989, Kennedy said.
About eight staffers are still monitoring the cleanup.
   ``This spill is not on a level of intensity with the Exxon
Valdez,'' Kennedy said. But his team learned from that disaster to
anticipate the worst.
   ``We all said, `The weather is good, the currents aren't too
bad, we ought to be able to keep the oil from reaching shore,''' he
said. ``Then we had a windstorm come up and drive the oil not just
to the shore but far beyond where the tide would normally reach.''
   ``We've gotten more skeptical.''

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union on Wednesday briefed China about
the U.S.-Soviet summit, in the latest of a flurry of Chinese-Soviet
contacts.
   Moscow and Beijing normalized relations last year during a visit
by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The two Communist powers had split over ideological differences
in the late 1950s, and came close to going to war after several
bloody border clashes in 1969.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said the Soviet deputy foreign
minister, Igor Rogachov, met with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen to discuss the U.S.-Soviet summit in Washington at the
beginning of June.
   The report quoted Qian as saying China supports efforts by
Washington and Moscow to improse ties.
   Qian said China welcomed the strategic arms reduction agreement
reached at the summit. The agreement, however, was little more than
a statement of what had already been accomplished and was not
considered a breakthrough in arms reduction talks.
   ``We ... hope that the Soviet Union and the United States will,
as soon as possible, reach a detailed agreement and put it into
practice,'' Qian said.
   The two leaders also discussed Sino-Soviet relations, Cambodia
and other international affairs, Xinhua said. It said the two sides
decided that the fifth round of Sino-Soviet border talks would
begin on July 26 in Moscow.
   The two sides have been holding talks to resolve territorial
disputes along the border since 1987. In February, Chinese and
Soviet military experts agreed both sides should cut forces along
the 4,300-mile frontier.
   Rogachov's visit is the latest in a series of recent Sino-Soviet
exchanges.
   Last month, the Soviet Union sent its highest-ranking Communist
Party delegation to China since the two nations normalized ties.
   Earlier this month, the Soviet National Defense Ministry's
director of foreign affairs, Rear Admiral V. Hujokov, visited
Beijing to increase contacts between the two armies.
   At the same time, the vice chairman of China's Central Military
Commission, Liu Huaqing, was in Moscow.
   Soviet Chief of General Staff Mikhail Moiseyev said that during
Liu's visit, the two sides agreed to begin ``building their
military relations on a new basis,'' according to a Xinhua dispatch.
   Moiseyev said the two sides also agreed to establish economic
relations, and added that improving military relations was a
natural process.

   Gov. Edward D. DiPrete announced
Wednesday he plans to run for a fourth term by claiming credit for

   DiPrete, 55, made his announcement on the Statehouse front lawn

   ``Preserving strong family values, promoting better schools,
protecting our environmental heritage and enabling all Rhode

record, the Republican said.
   Surveys indicate that DiPrete faces a tough battle against
whoever emerges from the three-way Democratic primary in September.
   That contest pits Providence Mayor Joseph R. Paolino Jr. against
businessman and twice-unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate Bruce G.
Sundlun and Warwick Mayor Francis X. Flaherty.
   DiPrete has no opposition for the GOP nomination.

<TEXT>
   The government is dispatching more
policemen and soldiers to the drug capital of Medellin, where
cartel-hired assassins have killed more than 100 police this year,
authorities said Wednesday.
   A Medellin police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said 220 men from an elite anti-drug police unit would join the
4,000-member police force already in the city.
   That follows word that another 350 soldiers would be sent to
Medellin. Gen. Jesus Armando Arias announced that mobilization at a
news conference Tuesday.
   Medellin, Colombia's second largest city, has about 3 million
residents.
   Officials say 106 policemen have been killed in the city so far
this year. Drug traffickers in April offered a $4,300 bounty for
each police officer killed.
   The latest killings came Tuesday night in western Medellin.
Three unidentified assailants opened fire with machine guns on a
truck carrying the bodyguards of the regional police commander.
   A Medellin police spokeman told the Associated Press that two
police agents were killed in the attack.
   The Medellin cartel boasted in a communique Tuesday night that
it has killed even more police than officials say.
   The cartel, which calls itself The Extraditables, said the
murder of policemen is a response to ``the sackings, the tortures
and the murders of our companions and of innocent people in poor
neighborhoods.''
   It blamed police for violence that has left 107 people dead in
Medellin. Authorities say most of the killings result from gang
rivalry and score-settling among opposing drug factions.
   In their statement Tuesday, the Extraditables said officials
they have managed to frighten many police officers into quitting.
   ``The Colombian people should be told the truth about the
resignations and desertions and it would also be nice if the real
number of deaths suffered by the institution were not hidden or
diminished,'' the statement said.
   The drug traffickers have been pressuring the government to end
its war on drugs, under which traffickers have been extradited to
face trial in the United States.

   In the Arkansas race, businessman Kenneth ``Muskie'' Harris
trounced Ku Klux Klan sympathizer Ralph Forbes by more than a 6-1
margin on Tuesday to win the Republican nomination for lieutenant
governor.
   In South Carolina, state Sen. Theo Mitchell soundly defeated
state Sen. Ernest Passailaigue in the Democratic gubernatorial
primary.
   In one other election with racial overtones, the first black
mayor of Atlantic City, N.J., James L. Usry, was ousted by a white
challenger in a runoff. Usry was recently indicted on corruption
charges.
   Voters also elected the first black mayor of Trenton, N.J.,
chose congressional candidates in Maine and rejected a sales tax
increase in North Dakota.
   In Arkansas, Harris said his victory over Forbes showed that
Arkansas voters had ``finally rejected the old tactics of the KKK
and the neo-Nazis, and white supremacists' effort to deceive the
public.''
   In final, unofficial returns, Harris, a 36-year-old executive
with a Little Rock hair products company, had 27,548 votes, or 86
percent, to Forbes' 4,432 votes, or 14 percent.
   Harris is only the second black candidate ever nominated for a
constitutional office in Arkansas and hopes to become the first
black elected to such an office. But he will be an underdog in
November against a strong Democratic nominee, ex-Rep. Jim Guy
Tucker.
   Forbes, a former member of the American Nazi Party who believes
in racial separatism, insisted he had been robbed of the election.
Told that he was losing his home county, Pope, by 68 votes to 8, he
replied, ``I've got more than eight kids, for crying out loud.''
The county's total at the end of the night was 571-79.
   In South Carolina, with 99 percent of the precincts reporting,
Mitchell had defeated Passailaigue by 116,922, or 60 percent, to
76,790, or 40 percent.
   ``I'm very humble,'' Mitchell said as he accepted the party's
nomination. ``As a man of color, it shows that we are still
fulfilling the promise of this great nation.''
   Mitchell would become the state's first black governor if he
defeated popular Republican Gov. Carroll Campbell in the fall.
   ``He's going to be the next governor of South Carolina,''
Passailaigue said of Mitchell. ``I'm convinced of that.''
   In Atlantic City, Usry received 4,427 votes, or 38 percent, to
Whelan's 7,244, or 62 percent. The mayor had been dogged by his
indictment on charges of illegally accepting $6,000 last summer.
   Race played a role in the campaign. Usry, angered by a lack of
white support in the May 8 election, refused to campaign in two
predominantly white wards. He received 49 votes in those wards
Tuesday, to Whelan's 4,522.
   Across the state, county Freeholder Douglas Palmer scored a
close victory over Mayor Carmen Armenti, apparently becoming
Trenton's first black mayor. Palmer received 12,933 votes to 12,636
for Armenti, who called for a recount.
   In Maine, a Democratic state senator and a Republican
ex-congressman won the right to face off for the congressional seat
of Democratic Rep. Joseph E. Brennan, who is trying to regain his
job of governor.
   In a five-way Democratic race, state Sen. Thomas Andrews upset
Attorney General James E. Tierney. With 89 percent of the precincts
reporting, Andrews had 15,203 votes, or 37 percent, and Tierney
garnered 13,955 votes, or 34 percent. Three other candidates
trailed.
   On the Republican side, former Rep. David Emery defeated state
Rep. John McCormick. With 68 percent of the precincts reporting,
Emery had 15,486 votes, or 63 percent; McCormick had 9,214 votes,
or 37 percent.
   North Dakota voters turned down an effort to raise sales taxes
from 5 percent to 6 percent for a year to improve education. The
sales tax lost, 74,011 to 52,592, a 59-to-41 percent margin.
   They also turned thumbs down on Labor Commissioner Byron
Knutson, who had been accused of sloppy management. The two
nominees, who will face off in November, were Craig Hagen, a
political newcomer who won't reach the minimum age for the office
of 25 until after the primary, and S.F. ``Buckshot'' Hoffner, head
of the state Centennial Commission.
   Hagen had 60,740 votes, or 50 percent; Hoffner had 37,731, or 31
percent; Knutson had 23,097 votes, or 19 percent.
   One of two counties west of Bismarck rejected a non-binding
measure to switch from Mountain to Central time. In Mercer County,
1,325 opposed the change and 1,171 were in favor. In Oliver County,
675 voted for the Central time and 295 were opposed.

   A White House move to ease immigration
restrictions for an international AIDS conference has not swayed
the more than 100 groups that plan to boycott next week's event,
AIDS activists said Wednesday.
   The activists, releasing the American edition of an
international study on AIDS discrimination, said the U.S.
immigration limits are part of a worldwide pattern that's spreading
fear ``as widespread and destructive as the virus itself.''
   Martin Foreman, author of the Panos Institute report, said more
than 100 groups are boycotting the conference despite a new 10-day
visa the United States announced in April for AIDS-infected
foreigners who want to attend the conference.
   Groups listed as boycotting the 6th International Conference on
AIDS include the International League of the Red Cross, the
European Community, the Canadian Public Health Association, the
World Council of Churches and the Roman Catholic Church's charity
group, Caritas International.
   The San Francisco meeting is June 20-24.
   ``One of the purposes of the conference, which is the free
international exchange of information, has already been defeated,''
Foreman said.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service had denied entry to
the United States to anyone with acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, one of a handful of diseases that bar entry to the
country.
   Those applying for the new visa don't have to reveal whether
they are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV,
which causes AIDS. But AIDS activists said the limited visa sends
the wrong message to those already facing discrimination.
   Carol Wolchok, director of the American Bar Association's
Immigration Law Implementation Project, said the ABA believes those
who have the HIV virus should not be barred entry to the country.
   ``Leaving HIV on the list of highly contagious diseases is
counterproductive,'' she said. ``It fosters a false sense of
security that the United States can isolate itself from HIV.''
   Foreman said that although many groups are officially boycotting
the conference, some may send observers who won't attend in an
official capacity.
   The London-based Panos Institute is a non-profit, international
organization that studies environmental and development issues.

   The White House today hailed Moscow's decision
to ease its economic blockade against Lithuania. ``We welcome this
announcement,'' President Bush's spokesman said.
   The statement was issued by Marlin Fitzwater after the Tass news
agency quoted Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene as
saying the Soviet Union agreed to restore some fuel and raw
material supplies.
   The supplies were cut off two months ago to force Lithuania to
drop its declaration of independence.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met in Moscow on Tuesday
with leaders of the Baltic republics. Bush said today he hoped that
meeting was the ``first step'' toward ending the crisis over the
secessionist republics.
   Shortly after Bush made his comments at a news conference, Tass
reported the easing the economic blockade.
   Fitzwater, referring to Tuesday's meeting and the easing of the
sanctions, said, ``We welcome this announcement. Together with the
beginning of the dialogue yesterday, these are positive steps.''
   Bush opened a news conference with out-of-town reporters by
applauding Gorbachev's meeting on Tuesday with the presidents of
Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia.
   ``I think it was good news. I don't want to overstate it. But I
was very pleased to see this occur in the wake of what I think was
a successful summit meeting,'' Bush said.
   Bush said Gorbachev's decision to meet with the three presidents
represents ``a very significant change that's occured in the Soviet
Union.''
   ``We applaud President Gorbachev's meeting with the Baltic
presidents,'' he said.
   ``I hope that what we saw yesterday is a first step in a
dialogue that will lead to the self-determination that we strongly
support,'' Bush said.
   The president also renewed his call for Moscow to lift its
economic boycott against Lithuania.
   At the same time, Bush criticized Moscow for its continued
support of Cuban leader Fidel Castro. ``The Soviets ought to stop
spending $5 billion a year in Cuba,'' he said.
   ``I would not accept the idea that this is the time to change
our policy with regard to Fidel Castro,'' Bush said.
   In a session that covered a range of subjects, Bush also
promised again a decision within days on restricting oil drilling
off the coasts of Florida and California. ``It's a very hot item,''
Bush said.
   He said he still had not gotten all the information he needs to
make a final decision on the long-delayed administration policy on
drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf.
   On another pending environmental issue, Bush said he was
searching for a compromise that would result in protecting the
northern spotted owl without ``throwing people out of work'' in the
Pacific Northwest.
   The administration must decide this month whether to declare the
owl an endangered species. Such a designation would shut off vast
tracts of forest to timber operations.
   ``I am very much concerned about the potential loss of jobs,''
Bush said.
   Bush also underscored his policy against normalizing relations
with Iran ``until all our hostages are out,'' Bush said. Six
Americans continue to be held by pro-Iranian factions in Lebanon.
   The president also voiced optimism toward resolution of the
crisis in the Baltics on Tuesday, both in a session with reporters
in the Rose Garden and again at a Republican fund-raising dinner.
   The president praised Gorbachev's decision to discuss the
impasse directly on Tuesday with Lithuanian President Vytautas
Landsbergis and with the leaders of the two other Baltic states.
   ``I hope that out of that comes a further step towards
self-determination for the Baltics,'' Bush told reporters. ``I
think that's a heartening development,'' Bush said.
   The audience of more than 4,000 at the annual President's Dinner
_ which coincided with Bush's birthday _ stood and sang ``Happy
Birthday Mr. President.'' Organizers said the banquet generated
$6.9 million for Republican congressional candidates.
   ``I feel it in my bones, we can get the majority of the
Senate,'' Bush said.
   The president took questions from reporters after a Rose Garden
event to promote his campaign for a constitutional amendment
banning flag-desecration.
   Bush said flag desecration is ``unacceptable and must carry a
price'' and asked Congress to pass the amendment in the aftermath
of this week's Supreme Court ruling striking down an
anti-flag-burning law.
   On another subject, Bush said ``there's quite a bit going on
behind the scenes'' but he wasn't ready yet to announce his
decision on suspending talks with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   The administration has called on PLO leaders to renounce
specifically the May 30 attack on an Israeli beach by Palestinian
guerillas and to punish those responsible for it.
   Bush said he had discussed the incident on the phone earlier
Tuesday with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
   ``I want to see that terrorist act condemned, and those who did
it condemned,'' he added.
   The PLO issued a statement on Monday renouncing terrorism, but
did not specifically renounce the beach attack.

<HEAD>Retail Sales Post Third Consecutive Monthly Decline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retail sales fell again in May, posting their
first consecutive three-month decline since the last recession, the
government said Wednesday.
   Analysts saw the report as a reflection of fading consumer
confidence.
   ``Consumer confidence was down in May,'' said economist Sandra
Shaber of the Futures Group, a Washington management consulting
firm. ``Maybe the poor job market and very weak wage gains are
having an effect.''
   The Commerce Department said sales skidded 0.7 percent to a
seasonally adjusted $146.84 billion after falling 0.9 percent in
April and 0.4 percent in March. Sales had not fallen for three
straight months since the fall of 1981.
   Sales were even worse in April and March than first reported.
Commerce had said originally that sales were down 0.6 percent in
April and 0.2 percent a month earlier. They were unchanged in
February after rising 2.8 percent the previous month.
   Retail sales represent about half of consumer spending, which
has been a driving force since the 1981-82 recession. Overall,
consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's
economic activity.
   But most economists believed the economy would continue to skirt
a recession, although its growth would be weak for months to come.
   ``This does not necessarily indicate that the economy is in a
recession, or headed in that direction, since there are signs of
buoyancy elsewhere, such as in exports and capital investment,''
said economist Gordon Richards of the National Association of
Manufacturers. ``Nevertheless, the slackening of sales indicate a
weak second quarter and probably an even weaker third quarter.''
   Ms. Shaber also said the report was not ``the last nail in the
coffin of recession'' and could lead to promotional activity such
as lower prices. She said that would be ``good news for inflation.''
   On the other hand, S. Jay Levy of Levy Economic Forecasts in
Chappaqua, N.Y., said: ``It's an indication of a recessionary
trend.'' His organization contends there is a 60 percent chance the
economy will slide into a recession this year.
   Levy and Ms. Shaber both pointed to the weak job market, where
most recent gains reflected temporary government hiring of census
workers, while employment losses continued at factories and in the
construction industry.
   Automobile sales, a major component of retail sales, dropped 0.6
percent after a 1.6 percent decline in April.
   The manufacturing sector, including the automobile industry, has
been dampened by Federal Reserve efforts to keep interest rates
high so the economy would not overheat and fuel inflation.
   But even excluding automobiles, sales were down 0.8 percent in
May. In fact, sales were off in every sector except for clothing
and, Ms. Shaber said, ``that was on sale.'' Apparel and accessory
sales rose 2.4 percent.
   Overall sales of durable goods _ big-ticket items like cars that
are interest-sensitive because they often are made through loans _
fell 1.1 percent after sliding 1.7 percent in April. Building
materials plunged 4.2 percent and furniture and other home
furnishings fell 1.1 percent.
   Non-durable goods such as food and clothing slid 0.5 percent,
the same as in April. Declines were posted for general department
and grocery stores, both down 1.0 percent; gasoline stations, down
1.6 percent; drug stores, down 1.3 percent and restaurants and
bars, down 0.5 percent.

<TEXT>
   A German researcher hired 30 years ago by a French
government scientific agency testified Wednesday that he had no
choice but to become a spy for East Germany's secret service.
   Rolf Dobbertin is accused of passing on confidential information
about nuclear research and other topics to East Germany for 20
years, ending in 1979.
   His trial on espionage charges began Wednesday. The case is
expected to hinge on the issue of whether the information he
divulged was genuinely top secret.
   Dobbertin, 55, said he came to France after being awarded a
grant to study abroad. But he said he would not have been allowed
to accept it unless the secret service approved.
   ``In our country, nothing could be done without the
authorization of the security services,'' he said. ``Don't forget
this was during the Cold War. They wanted to be able to contact me
at any moment, and I had to learn how to code and decode messages.''
   He said his handlers mistrusted him because he had married a
West German woman while living in Paris.
   Judge Maurice Colomb asked if Dobbertin still considered himself
a Marxist, as he was in his youth.
   ``Marxism doesn't have a big future in the East,'' Dobbertin
replied.
   Dobbertin was unmasked in 1979 and held in custody for four
years during complex legal proceedings before being released on
bail in 1983. He has resumed his post at France's National Center
for Scientific Research.
   A verdict is expected Friday.

<HEAD>Air Traffic Controllers Strike in Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Managua's international airport was
closed today by striking air traffic controllers who want the
government to reinstate an officer in the Sandinista-controlled
army as chief of civil aeronautics.
   The controllers walked off the job Tuesday night.
   Hours earlier, they contacted the plane carrying President
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro and threatened to strike before her
flight from Costa Rica could land. The workers eventually allowed
the plane to land before their Sandinista-controlled union shut
down air traffic.
   The controllers are protesting the removal of Alejandro
Arguello, a major in the Sandinista-controlled army, as chief of
civil aeronautics.
   The walkout represents the second time since Mrs. Chamorro's
pro-U.S. government took over from the leftist Sandinistas on April
25 that the air traffic controllers have struck. The first time, in
mid-May, was in support of other civil servants who walked off the
job demanding higher pay.
   The strikes are occurring as Mrs. Chamorro is struggling to
solidify her power and improve the nation's economy, which was
devastated by a decade of fighting between the U.S.-backed Contra
rebels and the leftist Sandinistas.
   ``She was about five minutes from landing when we transmitted
the message to the pilot,'' controller Daniel Gonzalez said in a
telephone interview.
   The message was that the air traffic controllers wanted to talk
to Mrs. Chamorro. ``But she couldn't come (to the cockpit) because
of her knee,'' he said. Mrs. Chamorro, who suffered a recent knee
fracture, walks with a cane.
   Jorge Saballos, another controller, said the controllers read a
communique protesting Arguello's dismissal and demanded the
government abide by a May strike agreement promising not to fire
public employees. He said the controllers spoke briefly with
Interior Minister Carlos Hurtado by radio.
   They allowed the plane to land after being assured that
government representatives would speak in person with the
controllers, Gonzalez said.
   Once the plane landed, Hurtado and presidential spokesman Danilo
Lacayo spoke to the controllers, but nothing was resolved.
   Air traffic controller Orlando Ortega said passengers planes
were allowed to leave Nicaraguan air space Tuesday.
   ``As soon as they all left, we proceeded to shut down the
airspace, until talks start,'' Ortega said.
   The controllers want to talk with Construction Minister Jaime
Icabalceta, who fired Arguello last week after Civil Aeronautics
was transfered from the air force to the Construction Ministry.
   Ortega said the controllers let an Iberia flight land today
because it carried medicine. Ortega said four flights that were
supposed to arrive in Managua today had been canceled.
   Those flights were from Sahsa, Copa, Aeronica and Cubana
airlines.
   Lacayo, Hurtado and Icabalceta reportedly were in a Cabinet
meeting with Mrs. Chamorro.

<HEAD>Plan to Exit Soviet Jews through Finland in Danger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president has indicated he might
suspend a plan to route Soviet emigres through Finland unless
Israel says it will not settle Soviet Jews in the occupied
territories, newspapers said Wednesday.
   President Mauno Koivisto on Tuesday told 20 newspaper editors he
had made the demands on Jewish settlement to Israeli President
Chaim Herzog, who visited in May. Koivisto's remarks were printed
in newspapers Wednesday.
   Koivisto said Israel had ``reacted somewhat inadequately,'' to
his demands, the Uusi Suomi newspaper reported. The daily quoted
Koivisto as saying negotiations between Israel and Finland over the
plan had broken off.
   Finnish officials said in May they were completing a plan with
Israel to be a transit point for thousands of Soviet Jews.
President Mauno Koivisto had said the plan would go into effect in
late May.
   ``Officially Finland has not linked the transit of Soviet Jews
with guarantees from Israel but it is clear that the transfer can
only begin when Jerusalem has changed its current superficial
attitude,'' Uusi Suomi wrote.
   In Jerusalem, Iris Ben-Shahal, spokeswoman for a Jewish agency
helping to settle Jewish immigrants, said the threat was
significant because Finland is one of four major routes to get
Soviet emigrants to Israel.
   The other three routes are through Hungary, Romania and Poland.
   ``The Israelis have said that Israel is a free country, which we
don't particularly doubt, but we don't see that it concerns the
occupied territories,'' Helsinki Sanomat, the leading daily, quoted
Koivisto as saying.
   ``There is the possibility of interpreting this ... in such a
way that Israel considers the occupied territories as belonging to
them,'' the newspaper quoted Koivisto as saying.
   Since the reform initiatives introduced by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev record levels of Soviet Jews have left the
Soviet Union under freer emigration laws. Many have chosen to
emigrate to Israel.
   But Arab leaders have expressed concern that the Soviet Jews,
expected to number 750,000 over the next years, will be settled in
the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank. The territories were
taken from the Arabs in the 1967 Middle East War.
   At a recent superpower summit in Washington, President Bush and
Gorbachev asked Jerusalem not to settle Soviet Jews in the
territories, home to 1.7 million Palestinians and 700,000 Jewish
settlers.
   Israel says Jerusalem has no policy of settling Jews in the
territories, but immigrants can live where they choose.
   Israel's absorption minister, Yitzhak Peretz, said Wednesday
that 43,128 Soviet immigrants arrived in Israel this year, joining
another 13,000 who arrived in 1989. He said 318 have settled in the
West Bank.

   Lithuania's prime minister said today the Soviet
government has agreed to restore some fuel and raw material
supplies to the Baltic republic, easing an embargo imposed two
months ago, Tass reported.
   Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene made the comment after
meeting with Kremlin officials today, the Soviet news agency said.
   ``There are no doubts about the lifting of the economic
blockade. This was stated quite explicitly,'' Tass quoted
Prunskiene as saying after she met with Soviet Prime Minister
Nikolai Ryzhkov.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said she had reached an agreement with Ryzhkov
on a partial increase of the supply of natural gas and raw
materials to some enterprises in the republic, Tass said.
   She also said the Soviet government intends to review the
question of renewing the supply of fuel for Lithuanian agriculture.
   Mrs. Prunskiene was quoted by Tass as saying her republic would
``carefully discuss the question of freezing the republic's March
11 declaration of independence for the duration of negotiations
with the Soviet government.''
   Tass quoted Ryzhkov as describing today's encounter as ``the
beginning of a concrete dialogue on the question of future
negotiations.''
   The reported breakthrough in the impasse between Lithuania and
Moscow was hailed today by the White House. ``We welcome this
announcement,'' said a spokesman for President Bush, Marlin
Fitzwater. ``Together with the beginning of the dialogue yesterday,
these are positive steps.''
   On Tuesday, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met with the
presidents of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia after having refusing
for weeks to negotiate with the secessionist Baltic republics
unless they agreed to abide by the Soviet Constitution.
   President Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania hinted then that the
Kremlin might soon end the economic embargo imposed on his republic.
   Ryzhkov, who attended the session, said earlier today there was
progress on the impasse over the Baltic states' independence
declarations.
   The republics want independence lost when they were forcibly
annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940. Latvia and Estonia have taken
more cautious steps toward independence than Lithuania.
   Gorbachev stopped shipments of all oil, most natural gas and
other raw materials to Lithuania on April 18 to pressure the
republic into rescinding pro-independence laws. The embargo cut off
all of Lithuania's oil and much of its natural gas and certain raw
materials and put 26,000 citizens out of work.
   Before today's reported agreement, Lithuania had said it was
willing to negotiate on rolling back its independence laws but
steadfastly had refused to revoke its declaration of secession.
   The United States became involved in the standoff when lawmakers
in Congress suggested they would not approve a trade pact signed
during the superpower summit in Washington until Gorbachev opened
negotiations with the Baltic republics and lifted the economic
embargo he imposed on Lithuania.
   The trade agreement would expand opportunities for American
companies wishing to do business in the Soviet Union by reducing
red tape and providing greater protections against copyright piracy.
   The pact is important because it also could clear the way for
the United States to grant most-favored-nation trade status to the
Soviet Union, a benefit that could help Gorbachev in his efforts to
reform the nation's economy.
   Congress has indicated it will not stand in the way of the Bush
administration granting the improved trading status once the trade
pact is approved and the Soviets pass laws guaranteeing Jews the
right to emmigrate.

<HEAD>Administration Talking With Congressional Republicans About NEA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, faced with growing
furor over what some consider offensive art, has begun talks with
congressional Republicans on restricting grants awarded by the
National Endowment for the Arts, a congressman said Wednesday.
   Rep. Paul Henry, D-Mich., said after a meeting with NEA Chairman
Paul Frohnmayer that the administration had dropped its previous
strong opposition to any type of content restrictions or standards
in a bill to extend the life of the agency.
   The change comes as congressional concern is increasing over
federal subsidies going to arts projects that some consider
obscene, pornographic or sacrilegious.
   ``I think we've reached a point that if you're going to rescue
the NEA, you have to speak forthrightly about what receives public
support,'' Henry said. ``The members have gotten so much mail on
this that they're tired of the political baggage of it.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said he expected a bipartisan
agreement on the issue and a House vote by mid-July.
   Both House and Senate subcommittees considering NEA bills sent
the legislation to the full committees Wednesday without making a
decision on restrictions.
   ``We will have to deal with this controversy in the full
committee,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. ``It will not be swept
under the rug.''
   Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., said no agreement had been reached
and that he understood the Bush administration continued to oppose
writing new restrictions into law.
   ``All along, the White House, the NEA and a majority in the
Congress have recognized the political reality that there will be
some changes in the NEA,'' Williams said. ``What those are to be we
don't know. And there's no agreement.''
   The Bush administration originally proposed a five year
reauthorization, or extension of the life of the NEA, without any
restrictions on what types of art may or may not receive public
support.
   Faced with growing Republican sentiment for some kind of
restrictions, the administration last week proposed as an
alternative an interim one-year to three-year extension while an
independent commission studied the problem.
   Henry said the latest development was a recognition that leaving
the matter to NEA officials would not satisfy Congress.
   He said Frohnmayer, representing the Bush administration,
acknowledged for the first time that there is a difference between
censorship and deciding that some art may be inappropriate for
taxpayers' financial support.
   The NEA said in a formal statement that it would not comment on
the deliberations or any proposals for content restrictions.
   Henry, a Republican moderate in the NEA debate, is a member of
Williams' education subcommittee and has taken a leading role in
recent days in negotiating between various factions.
   Henry declined to detail what he will propose but said he was
continuing to talk with Frohnmayer in private. He said he hoped to
come up with language that affirmatively states what types of art
will be supported.
   He said neither the NEA nor White House had agreed to any
specifics so far.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., warned the NEA that ``people over
there had better understand the feeling of the American people.''
He said the public is ``sick and tired'' of ``promiscuous art.''
   Some conservatives, led by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calf., have
been pressing for strong prohibitions on what they call
anti-religious or ``morally reprehensible'' art.
   The controversy was triggered a year ago over the works of two
photographers, one whose images depicted homoerotic scenes and the
other showing a crucifix in a jar of urine.

<HEAD>New Communist Platform Borrows from Right, Left to Avoid Split</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soviet-Lithuania, Bjt</HEAD>

   Communist Party leaders are borrowing ideas from
conservative and reform-minded challengers for a new platform they
hope will prevent the first major split in ranks since Lenin, a
Politburo member said Wednesday.
   But less than three weeks before the opening of the 28th party
conference, many party members and observers expect more breaks in
the party structure as it tries to control a rapidly changing
Soviet society.
   ``We are trying to develop the broadest possible platform,''
Politburo member Vadim A. Medvedev told a news conference.
   Medvedev said the platform will include some reformist policies,
but not totally break with orthodox Marxist-Leninist ideology such
as social organizations and party cells among workers.
   Although he declined to outline the entire platform proposal,
Medvedev said it will not accommodate the Democratic Platform's
call to turn the Communist Party into a parliamentary body.
   He said separate structures in the party are unacceptable.
   ``If we are talking about such fractions, there is no sense in
being in the party. It should splinter and set up its own party,''
he said.
   Democratic Platform, the main reform group within the party, is
scheduled to meet this weekend to discuss strategy for the
congress, which begins July 2.
   Democratic Platform leaders have predicted the congress will be
dominated by moderates, and that Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev would not push through enough changes to recapture
disenchanted party members.
   The group is demanding the party give up control of newspapers
and property, and dismantle party cells in the army, KGB, the
police and factories.
   It also opposes one person serving as both party chief and the
nation's president, as Gorbachev now does.
   Party data released by Medvedev on Wednesday indicates 43
percent of the congress delegates chosen so far are members of the
party apparatus, considered as among the most resistant to change
because their jobs depend on the party's continued influence.
   Among the more than 4,000 delegates already elected to the
4,700-seat congress, the number of workers and farmers has dropped
drastically from the last congress, Medvedev said.
   Forty-two percent of the delegates in 1986 were workers, and 9
percent were farmers, Medvedev said. This year's figures so far are
11.6 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively.
   He said an extra 350 representatives for workers and farmers
will be invited to the congress, which will decide whether they may
vote.
   Members of the apparatus likely will approve the proposed party
platform obediently, said Vyacheslav Shostakovsky, a Democratic
Platform leader and the rector of Moscow's Higher Party School.
   Shostakovsky, however, said he was pesimistic the congress would
implement major changes.
   Democratic Platform leaders say they expect support from about
500,000 of the Communist Party's 18 million members.
   But they have only about 100 delegates so far for the congress.
   Philosopher Igor Chubais suggested Democratic Platform could
hurt its own popularity by lambasting the increasingly unpopular
Communists.
   ``An anti-communist mood is growing. This is a fact,'' he said.
``The attitude to the very idea of communism is very negative.
   ``I would appeal not for reform, but for distancing ourselves
from the Soviet Communist Party.''

<TEXT>
   At least 3 million gallons of oil leaked
from the fire-ravaged supertanker in the Gulf of Mexico, but most
of it has burned or evaporated, the Coast Guard said today.
   Coast Guard Capt. Thomas Greene said crews found a hole in a
center tank in the 886-foot Mega Borg.
   ``A minimum of 3 million gallons has left the cargo tanks and
I'm presuming that most of that has gone into the water,'' Greene
told reporters. ``I don't see any risk of losing cargo from the
other tanks.''
   He said between 12,000 gallons and 40,000 gallons remained in
the waters of the Gulf of Mexico today.
   Greene said an oil sheen stretching 12 miles from the Mega Borg
had begun forming into tar balls. He said he expected the balls to
wash ashore, but could not determine where they might land or how
soon.
   Salvage boats and Coast Guard ships were skimming the water and
using floating barriers to try to corral the slick.
   The Norwegian ship was loaded with 38 million gallons of light
crude oil when it was rocked by a series of engine-room explosions
early Saturday. Official said they were not sure if
flame-smothering foam would be used as planned.
   On Tuesday, firefighters spraying water on the searing deck
boarded the ship and declared the fire controlled nearly four days
after the first of a series of explosions ripped through the vessel
57 miles southeast of Galveston.
   ``They're smothering the fire,'' Petty Officer Gene Maestas said
today. ``There are occasional flareups on board and there is some
steam coming from the water being pour on it. But they are not
using the foam yet and I'm not sure they will.''
   The blasts on Saturday and fire left the ship with one deck
awash, and crews had feared it would break up or sink with its
cargo.
   In gaining the upper hand on the blaze, firefighters solved one
problem but may have created another.
   ``What appears to be happening, that since they are getting the
fire under control, is it's not burning up as much oil and more oil
is getting in the water,'' said Coast Guard Lt. j.g. Robert Garrott.
   The Norwegian government opened a hearing today in Galveston to
interview crew members who were aboard when the tanker exploded
while transferring cargo to a smaller vessel. Two of the 41 crewmen
died, two were missing and presumed dead and 17 were injured, none
seriously.
   ``This will be purely fact finding,'' Norwegian Consul General
Erik Leikvang said.
   The cause of the explosion is unknown.
   Five fireboats and a hose placed on the deck by firefighters
continued dousing the burning stern. Aircraft dropped about 9,000
gallons of oil dispersant.
   Pemex, the Mexican government oil monopoly, said that at the
U.S. government's request, it sent the 146-foot vessel that sucks
up oil and water at the rate of 84,000 gallons an hour, separates
out the oil and stores it.
   Thick gray smoke and steam surrounded the hulk, replacing the
balls of flame and towering columns of black smoke that had risen
from the vessel.
   Ted Hoskins, who heads the salvage operation, boarded the ship
with a crew Tuesday and declared the fire under control, Greene
said.
   ``Our latest videos we got, I can see no fire visible,'' Greene
said Tuesday. He said there were still flames beneath the deck.
   An 825-foot British-registered tanker stood by to begin
receiving the remainder of the Mega Borg's cargo.
   Greene said that operation could be dangerous because the ship
is listing and crews might have to pump water into the holds to
keep the vessel balanced. The ship's rear has dropped more than 60
feet and remained awash today.
   ``We're feeling fairly confident at this point, but we're not
going to really breathe easy until the oil is back in a terminal,''
Petty Officer Todd Nelson said.
   The Mega Borg carried more than three times as much oil as was
spilled by the Exxon Valdez off Alaska in March 1989 in the
nation's worst oil spill.
   Coast Guard officials said the light crude would disperse more
easily than the Exxon Valdez's heavy crude, but environmentalists
said they still fear the oil will reach bays and estuaries where it
will be toxic to birds and shellfish.
   Currents and winds were expected to push escaping oil toward a
200-mile stretch of coast between Freeport and Corpus Christi. But
the Coast Guard said the currents also were expected to keep the
spill from coming ashore.
   The tanker, operated by Mosvolds Shipping of Farsund, Norway,
was bound from Palanca, Angola. It was scheduled to travel to Aruba
after Galveston.
   Elf Trading Inc., a Houston subsidiary of a French oil and gas
company, owned the cargo and said it would participate in the
cleanup.

<HEAD>German Businessman Admits Helping Build Alleged Chemical Weapons
Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANNHEIM, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West German businessman accused
of helping build an alleged chemical weapons plant in Libya
testified Wednesday that he was involved but didn't know the
factory would make arms.
   Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen, ex-director of the Imhausen-Chemie
company, said he had suspicions the project ``would be in conflict
with West Germany's export laws'' but did not investigate because
he ``didn't want to lose the business.''
   West German prosecutors, government and security officials have
said they have proof the plant in the Libyan desert was made to
produce poison gas. Libya denies it.
   Hippenstiel, 49, whose trial began Monday in Mannheim District
Court, is charged with violating West Germany's export laws and
evading taxes in connection with the $136 million project.
   Reading from a prepared statement, Hippenstiel said the project
in Rabta, Libya, south of Tripoli, got its start in 1984 when a
``middleman'' contacted him about building a chemical plant to make
``pharmaceuticals and insecticides.''
   Hippenstiel said that as head of Imhausen-Chemie, located in
Lahr in southern West Germany near Mannheim, he ``participated in
construction of the Rabta factory'' by delivering production plans
and equipment for the project.
   The former company manager said he was sorry he had caused what
he called ``diplomatic problems'' for West Germany because of the
deal with Libya.
   ``The responsibility and overall management (of the project) was
in my hands,'' Hippenstiel said.
   West Germany's national television said Hippenstiel's statement
appeared to confirm that he was aware poison gas could be produced
at the Rabta plant. However, Hippenstiel did not admit that in his
statement.
   The trim, bespectacled Hippenstiel faces tax evasion charges in
connection with payments for helping build the plant.
   Hippenstiel admitted not paying taxes on $11.7 million on
profits from his transactions. He said however, that he did not
keep the money for himself, but used it to ensure the project in
Rabta would be completed.
   The Libyan plant scandal first came to light in December 1988,
when the United States government charged that West German
companies were providing massive assistance for construction of a
chemical factory capable of producing poison gas.
   West German government officials at first denied any of the
country's companies were involved but later acknowledged the
allegations were true.
   Hippenstiel headed the company that allegedly was the key
supplier of equipment, construction plans and technical expertise
to develop the project.
   A 100-page indictment alleges that Hippenstiel played a leading
role in the project from 1984 to 1988, when he headed the chemical
company.
   In opening arguments, prosecutor Hans-Heiko Klein said
Hippenstiel had delivered plans and documents, as well as providing
material valued at $12 million.
   The primary allegations against the defendant revolved around
violations of West German export laws, designed to hinder any
participation in such illegal projects abroad.
   Hippenstiel has been held in prison for the last 14 months
awaiting the start of his trial. More than 60 witnesses are
expected to be heard at the trial, which is not expected to be
completed until sometime in September.

   A black businessman who gained the GOP
nomination for lieutenant governor during a runoff against a Ku
Klux Klan sympathizer said his victory shows how far the South has
come since 1957.
   Kenneth ``Muskie'' Harris on Tuesday drubbed Ralph Forbes, a
former American Nazi who wound down his campaign with an appearance
at a KKK rally Saturday.
   Another black candidate, South Carolina state Sen. Theo
Mitchell, soundly defeated state Sen. Ernest Passailaigue in the
Democratic gubernatorial primary. Mitchell would be that state's
first black governor, if he defeated popular Republican Gov.
Carroll Campbell.
   In one other election Tuesday with racial overtones, the first
black mayor of Atlantic City, N.J., James L. Usry, was ousted by a
white challenger in a runoff. Usry was recently indicted on
corruption charges.
   Voters also elected the first black mayor of Trenton, N.J.,
chose congressional candidates in Maine and rejected a sales tax
increase in North Dakota.
   After his triumph in Arkansas, Harris said: ``Everybody wants to
live in '57, but '57's dead. This is the 1990s.''
   Federal troops were sent to Little Rock in 1957 to ensure the
safety of nine black students who were admitted to Central High
School under a federal court order.
   Harris, nonetheless, is an underdog in his effort to become the
first black elected to such an office in Arkansas. His opponent in
the Nov. 6 general election is Democrat Jim Guy Tucker, a former
congressman and attorney general.
   ``I'm glad that the election came out the way it did,'' Tucker
said. ``We need to send a message that the vote for Mr. Forbes
wasn't representative of the people of Arkansas, and that's good.''
   Two weeks ago, Forbes got 46 percent of the 71,000 votes in a
three-way race. Harris got 36 percent to force a runoff and Robert
Breaux of Little Rock got 18 percent.
   The final breakdown Tuesday was Harris 27,548; Forbes 4,432.
Harris gained 1,876 votes in 14 days; Forbes lost 28,753. About
38,000 fewer voters turned out for the runoff than for the May 29
primary.
   ``We have finally rejected the old tactics of the KKK and the
neo-Nazis and white supremacists' effort to deceive the public,''
said Harris, who became the state's second black in the 20th
century to be nominated for a constitutional office.
   The 36-year-old former University of Arkansas defensive back is
a property-management executive with JM Products Inc., a Little
Rock company that manufactures hair-care products for blacks.
   ``I believe Arkansas' future is secure by the wisdom of her
public, God-fearing people who understand that our destiny should
not be dictated by hatred, power politics or one-party domination,
but by the competent ideas of leadership,'' said Harris.
   Even Forbes said Wednesday that his loss had a lot to do with
the fear of some voters that Arkansas' image would be tainted if a
Ku Klux Klan sympathizer won a statewide race.
   ``I think that's part of it,'' he said. ``People fell for that
Arkansas image stuff. We as a state have a real problem with
self-image. I was hoping to counter that on the issues.''
   Forbes refused to concede, and threatened to challenge the
election. ``I'll never concede,' he said. ``I feel like a winner.''

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of primary voting Tuesday in
five states:
   
   ARKANSAS&equals;
   Lieutenant Governor: Kenneth ``Muskie'' Harris, a black
executive, defeated Ralph Forbes, a Ku Klux Klan sympathizer and
former member of the American Nazi Party, in a runoff for the
Republican nomination. Harris will face former Rep. Jim Guy Tucker,
the Democratic nominee, in November.
   
   MAINE&equals;
   Congress: Both parties held primaries to fill the House seat
being vacated by Rep. Joseph E. Brennan, who is running for
governor. State Sen. Thomas Andrews upset Attorney General James E.
Tierney in a five-way Democratic race. Former U.S. Rep. David Emery
defeated state Rep. John McCormick in the GOP race.
   
   NEW JERSEY&equals;
   Atlantic City Mayor: Incumbent James L. Usry, under indictment
on charges of corruption, lost a runoff to City Councilman Jim
Whelan.
   Trenton Mayor: County Freeholder Douglas Palmer scored a close
victory over Mayor Carmen Armenti to become Trenton's first black
mayor. Armenti demanded a recount.
   
   NORTH DAKOTA&equals;
   Ballot measure: Voters defeated a proposal to raise sales taxes
from 5 percent to 6 percent for one year to improve education. At
least one of two counties west of Bismarck rejected a non-binding
measure to switch from Mountain to Central time.
   Labor Commissioner: Incumbent Byron Knutson, accused of sloppy
management, lost to S.F. ``Buckshot'' Hoffner, head of the state
Centennial Commission, and Craig Hagen, a political newcomer.
Hoffner and Hagen will face each other in November.
   
   SOUTH CAROLINA&equals;
   Governor: State Sen Theo Mitchell defeated state Sen. Ernest
Passailaigue in a Democratic primary, winning the right to
challenge Republican Gov. Carroll Campbell. Mitchell hopes to
become the state's first black governor.

<HEAD>Militant Black Group Says ANC Is `Selling Out'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black militant leader on
Wednesday called African National Congress talks with the white-led
South African government premature and a ``sellout.''
   Bennie Alexander, general-secretary of the Pan Africanist
Congress, said the government must agree to a one-person, one-vote
democracy before meaningful discussions can take place.
   ``If the government says it is against the principle (of
majority rule), then there is no basis for talks,'' Alexander told
a group of foreign journalists. ``We do not see a democractic
solution in the very near future.''
   President F.W. de Klerk's government held preliminary talks last
month with the ANC in a bid to resolve obstacles to full-scale
negotiations on a new constitution and ending apartheid. The ANC is
country's leading black opposition group.
   ``There is a perception among the masses that to talk to the
government now is selling out,'' Alexander said. ``The radical
youth consider it a sellout.''
   Asked if he agreed, Alexander said: ``Yes.''
   De Klerk says he wants the 5 million whites and 28 million
blacks to share power. He opposes outright black majority rule,
saying it will replace white domination with black domination. He
envisions a mechanism that will give whites veto power on major
policy decisions.
   The government has said it is ready to negotiate a new
constitution with the ANC and other black opposition groups.
   However, the ANC has set preconditions for formal negotiations
that include the release of some 3,000 activists convicted of
politically motivated crimes and the return of an estimated 20,000
exiles.
   The Pan Africanist Congress broke away from the much larger ANC
in 1959 and is considered more militant and ideological, although
the policies of the two groups are similar.
   Both favor a one-person, one-vote political system,
socialist-oriented economic policies and both wage largely
ineffective guerrilla campaigns.
   The Pan Africanists draw much of their support from black
intellectuals and radical youths. Their supporters often chant,
``One settler, one bullet'' _ a reference to whites whom the
organization considers colonialists.
   Youthful supporters of the two groups have battled each other in
several townships recently. The organizations reached a peace
agreement Tuesday in the Vosloorus township east of Johannesburg.

   Two guided missile destroyers and an oiler
from the Soviet Navy's Pacific fleet will visit San Diego as part
of the ongoing exchange between the U.S. and Soviet military, the
Pentagon said Wednesday.
   About 800 members of the Soviet Navy will be aboard the three
ships, which will begin their five-day visit at the San Diego Naval
Station on July 31, the Pentagon said in a statement.
   Adm. Charles R. Larson, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet,
will be host to his Soviet counterpart, Adm. Gennadij Alexandrovich
Khvatov, commander of the Soviet Pacific Ocean Fleet.
   The Soviet ships designated to participate are the guided
missile cruisers Adm. Vinogradov and Boyevoy, and the oiler Argun.
   Larson and three U.S. Navy ships will visit the Pacific port of
Vladivostok in September, the Pentagon said.
   Last summer, three Soviet Navy ships visited Norfolk, Va., and
U.S. Navy ships visited the Black Sea port of Sevastopol in the
first round of the naval exchanges.

<HEAD>Press Freedom Guaranteed, But Limited without Paper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Press freedom has been enshrined for the first
time in Soviet law, but doubts remain about whether the long debate
was worth it and whether it means much in a country that cannot
produce enough newsprint to ensure it.
   The Supreme Soviet legislature on Tuesday approved a law that
places in the legal code a key element of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's glasnost policy: the media's freedom from any kind of
censorship.
   ``The press and other mass media are free,'' the law says.
``Censorship of the mass media is forbidden.''
   Strict control of the media was a hallmark of Soviet rule for
decades. A journalists' role was first to be an agitator for
Communist Party policies and second to be a source of information.
The limited reports of the state- or party-run media defined what
millions of people knew about their country and the outside world.
   Despite wide approval in the legislature, the bill took months
to be approved. One prominent veteran of the dissident movement
questioned publicly whether it even was necessary in an era of
reform.
   ``I'm afraid that my writing brothers will beat me with stones,
but is a law on the press necesary?'' asked Elena Bonner in a
recent edition of the weekly Moscow News.
   Mrs. Bonner, widow of human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov,
said press freedom could be guaranteed through changes that will be
made in the Soviet Constitution.
   In that case, disputes can be settled by Soviet courts in much
the same way they are settled in the United States, which
guarantees freedom of press in its constitution.
   The law guarantees the right for Soviets to start their own
publications. But as Soviets are finding in other cases, the
country's poor economic condition places practical restrictions on
their new legal rights.
   Production of paper and printing plants still are part of the
state-run economy. The economy cannot produce enough newsprint. In
the past couple of years, subscriptions to many national newspapers
and magazines have been restricted because of a lack of newsprint.
   Scores of unofficial papers have sprung up, reflecting the
country's new thirst for poltics and debate. Their publishers must
scramble to reach agreements with state-run printing houses to
supply the paper they need.
   Rabochaya Tribuna, one dail newspaper, said Wednesday that
shortages of newsprint ``place in question the single unarguable
success of perestroika _ glasnost.''
   Perestroika is Russian for restructuring and glasnost means
openness.
   The newspaper visited a factory near Gorky, about 200 miles east
of Moscow where Sakharov was exiled for almost seven years, that
produces about a third of the country's newsprint.
   It said the factory was built more than 60 years ago with
foreign help, and that foreign help is once again needed to
modernize it.
   But it accused the Soviet bureaucracy of preventing the factory
from keeping enough of the hard currency it earns to buy spare
parts or new equipment.
   ``Wouldn't it be just to allow us to keep half of the hard
currency we earn, rather than 2 percent, as is now done?'' asked
the factory director, V. Lapukhin.

<HEAD>Report: Army Won't Make Deadline For Disposing Chemical Weapons</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Army expects to miss an April 1997
deadline for destroying chemical weapons even though the Bush
administration says disposal of the arms will begin ahead of
schedule, a report released Wednesday says.
   The General Accounting Office said in the report that the Army's
disposal program has encountered several obstacles, including
environmental limitations, community opposition and a shortfall in
funds.
   The investigative arm of Congress found also that the projected
cost of destroying the weapons has doubled from a preliminary
estimate of $1.7 billion to $3.4 billion and will likely exceed the
latest figure.
   ``Since current construction, equipment and personnel
requirements have continued to rise, total program costs will
increase even more,'' the GAO report said.
   The agency attributed the cost increases to incomplete
information the Army used in its preliminary estimate and program
changes to ensure safety.
   The Army said Wednesday it had not reviewed the report and had
no immediate comment.
   The report came less than two weeks after a U.S.-Soviet
agreement to reduce superpower chemical weapons stockpiles and the
administration's announcement that it would begin destroying the
weapons by the end of this year.
   Administration officials said the target date for the program is
well ahead of the schedule set in the accord signed by President
Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev during their U.S.
summit, which ended June 3.
   That pact requires each side to reduce its stockpile to 5,000
tons by 2002, although the Soviets have no active facility for
destroying their weapons.
   The U.S. and Soviet Union hold the world's largest supplies of
the weapons, which can blister the skin or disturb the nervous
system. The United States says it has about 25,000 tons of chemical
agents; the Soviets claim to have 50,000 tons.
   Destruction of the arms is supposed to begin by Dec. 31, 1992.
   The administration said destruction of the weapons, now stored
in West Germany, would begin at the Johnston Atoll plant on a
remote Pacific Ocean island by the end of the year.
   The plant was built to meet a 1985 congressional requirement to
destroy all existing U.S. chemical weapons by 1997 as a condition
for approving a Pentagon program to produce a new generation of
such arms.
   However, the GAO said that due to a ``nine-month delay in the
start of operational verification testing at Johnston Atoll, the
Army believes that the overall program has slipped and that
therefore the complete disposal of the chemical weapons stockpile
by April 1997 is improbable.''
   In addition, the Army announced in 1988 that it planned to build
similar disposal facilities at each of the eight chemical munitions
storage sites in the continental United States.
   The sites are Tooele, Utah; Anniston, Ala.; Pine Bluff, Ark.;
Umatilla, Ore.; Pueblo, Colo.; Newport, Ind.; Lexington-Blue Grass,
Ky.; and Aberdeen, Md.
   The GAO said community opposition and environmental requirements
could delay the construction of the additional sites.
   In addition, purchasing of equipment for the Utah plant was
delayed by a $37 million shortfall in funds for the fiscal year
that began Oct. 1, 1989.
   The GAO said also that the Army faces community opposition in
Indiana, Kentucky and Maryland that will put the Army's disposal
schedule in jeopardy.

<TEXT>
   Soldiers shot at anti-government
demonstrators in central Bucharest tonight after the protesters
occupied state-run television and stormed and burned police
headquarters, witnesses said.
   One witness reported seeing at least two bodies after the
shooting, but this could not be immediately confirmed.
   The most serious violence in the Romanian capital since
December's revolution that toppled the Ceausescu regime was caused
by a pre-dawn police raid that ended a 53-day anti-Communist
protest in University Square.
   Demonstrators clashed with police during the afternoon in the
square, then fanned out to police headquarters, secret police
headquarters, the TV station and Victory Square, headquarters of
the governing National Salvation Front.
   The shooting occurred outside the secret police headquarters,
where the late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's hated Securitate force
operated.
   Before the buildings were attacked, President-elect Ion Iliescu
issued a communique calling on all ``aware and responsible people''
to surround government buildings and state TV to ward off
``extremist groups'' and to save Romania's democracy ``earned with
so much difficulty.''
   Scottish free-lance photographer Jeremy Sutton-Hibbert said he
saw soldiers shooting from inside the Securitate building in
downtown Bucharest. He said he saw the body of a man in his 40s who
had been shot in the head. He said other photographers had seen at
least one more body near the building, which was ringed by half a
dozen armored personnel carriers.
   State-run television, scene of fierce fighting during December's
revolution, was stormed by the protesters who occupied one of the
main studios. An announcer said they might not be able to transmit
any longer. Minutes later, the picture was cut and shortly
afterward the sound was also cut.
   Demonstrators carrying gasoline cans got into headquarters of
the regular police this evening and set fire to cars and trucks
nearby.
   About 1,500 people stood outside, watching the right wing of the
building burn. Some civilians working in the headquarters leaned
out the windows, looking panicked and coughing.
   Every few minutes, there were minor explosions, apparently from
gasoline in the vehicles set ablaze.
   People who thronged the streets booed as helicopters flew
overhead surveying the situation.
   The demonstrators say Communists still dominate the National
Salvation Front, which has been in power since the December
revolution and which won last month's free elections by a landslide.
   The government said more than 260 people were detained when
steel-helmeted police moved in before dawn to break up the sit-in
in University Square that had blocked the capital's main
thoroughfare for 53 days.
   Witnesses said the police clubbed several protesters. Casualty
figures were not immediately available, but officials said one
policeman was injured in the clash with an estimated 1,000 people
supporting the demonstrators.
   About 20 hunger strikers were among those camped in a small tent
city in University Square. Police took the fasting demonstrators,
some of whom had gone without food for a month, to the hospital.
   The protesters supporting the hunger strikers freed two people
detained in a police van then overturned the vehicle and set it on
fire, witnesses said. Several buses and trucks were also reported
on fire.
   The attack on the police headquarters occurred several hours
later.
   A government communique issued soon after the square was cleared
said 263 people were detained for investigation. It accused
protesters of attempting to resist the police with violence and
said some arms were confiscated.
   Brindusa Muresan, who had been on a hunger striker since May 9,
said some of her colleagues were clubbed by police in the lobby of
the nearby Intercontinental Hotel.
   She said they were taken to a police station, fingerprinted and
photographed and sent to the hospital for tests.
   Protesters, their ranks sometimes swelling to as many as 10,000
by day, had blocked traffic in the central square since April 22,
dubbing the area a ``Communist-free zone.'' The protesters have
pressed for a 10-year ban on former Communists officials _ such as
Iliescu _ holding office.
   The demonstrators also demanded independent and private
broadcast media. Government officials who met with the hunger
strikers for the first time on Monday pledged their support for
establishing such stations.

<TEXT>
   Tamil guerrillas battled government
troops in northern and eastern Sri Lanka on Wednesday, ignoring a
cease-fire, residents and military officials said Wednesday.
   Unconfirmed reports reaching Colombo said the Tamil Tiger rebels
massacred at least 125 policemen who were among 600 officers
captured when the Tigers overran 11 police stations Monday.
   Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne said the report ``seems
to be authentic, but we have to double-check.'' He characterized
the situation as ``war.''
   In addition to the reported massacre of policemen, as many as 90
government soldiers, Tamil Tigers and civilians may have been
killed since Monday, according to reports compiled by residents,
military sources and the Tigers. Officially, the government has
confirmed only the deaths of 16 soldiers.
   The violence is the most serious since Indian peacekeeping
troops left Sri Lanka in March after an unsuccessful, 32-month-long
effort to disarm the Tamil Tigers.
   It also raised the specter of a return to the all-out war
between the Tigers and government forces that prevailed before the
Indians' arrival on July 30, 1987.
   Wijeratne said reports of the police massacre came from one
policeman who survived and escaped. He quoted the policeman as
saying the Tigers killed 150 of his colleagues. Military officials
in Colombo said the death toll could be between 125 and 150.
   One of the officials quoted the policeman who escaped as saying
the Tigers on Tuesday told him and his colleagues they were going
to be released. They then were taken by trucks into the jungle
where they were forced to lie on the ground, sprayed with machine
gun fire and shot in the head, the official said.
   The policeman who escaped suffered a bullet graze on his head
and apparently was left for dead, the official said on condition of
anonymity.
   The accounts could not be independently verified because
telephone communications broke down Wednesday between Colombo and
the eastern Batticaloa region as the fighting spread to the
northern Vavuniya and Mannar regions.
   A cease-fire announced late Tuesday by the government and the
Tigers was to take effect at noon Wednesday. But military officials
in Colombo, speaking on condition of anonymity, said fighting
continued past the deadline.
   The officials also said about 3,000 soldiers were rushed to the
east coast on Wednesday to reinforce the 1,200 soldiers sent on
Tuesday.
   Residents in Vavuniya, 135 miles northeast of Colombo, said the
Tigers were still attacking police stations and army camps, and
government troops were returning fire. The residents spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The government and the Tigers opened negotiations in May 1989 in
an effort to end the 7-year-old Tamil revolt against the
Sinhalese-dominated government.
   The latest fighting began Monday when the Tigers took control of
police stations in the Batticaloa and Ampara districts along the
east coast, 135 miles across the island from Colombo.
   On Tuesday, the Tigers spread their siege to four army camps in
the east. At the same time, the government's chief negotiator,
Justice Minister Shahul Hameed, was in the northern town of Jaffna
for negotiations with top Tiger political leaders.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
Tamil rebels demand an independent nation, claiming their community
is discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent
of the population and control the government and the military.
   At least 11,000 people, including 1,100 Indian soldiers, have
been killed in the Tamil insurgency.

<TEXT>
   The owners of a communications
satellite that fell into a useless orbit said Wednesday they will
pay NASA to send up astronauts to repair the $157 million
spacecraft.
   NASA tentatively set the rescue mission for the 1992 inaugural
flight of the space shuttle Endeavour.
   The rescue of the unisured satellite is expected to cost
Intelsat more than half of the $146.5 million price for a
non-government shuttle mission.
   ``NASA has the technological know-how to reboost the satellite,
and we want to take advantage of NASA's expertise so we can boost
the satellite and it will have a 10-year lifespan,'' said company
spokesman Tony Trujillo.
   Intelsat's board of governors authorized the rescue attempt
during a weeklong meeting in Barbados that ended Wednesday.
   The satellite is orbiting at about 345 miles above Earth, 22,000
miles lower than intended. It was even lower when it failed to
separate properly from a Titan 3 rocket on March 14, but Intelsat
ground controllers managed to boost it.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said last
month it would try to save the satellite if Intelsat paid for the
mission. Last week, the federal Office of Management and Budget
approved NASA's proposed $130 million pricetag _ in 1988 dollars _
for non-government shuttle flights. That amounts to $146.5 million
for fiscal 1990.
   Intelsat will cover a ``sizable fraction'' of the expense since
other cargos will be on board, said NASA payload manager William D.
Green.
   The plan calls for Endeavour to carry a 20,000-pound motor that
will be attached to the satellite in the payload bay by
space-walking astronauts. The motor will contain a safety device to
prevent it from firing until the shuttle is at a safe distance.
   Intelsat ground controllers will send a command that will ignite
the motor and boost the 5-ton satellite to its proper stationary
orbit.
   The February 1992 date would not disrupt other shuttle flights,
Green said.
   ``Generally speaking, the reason we're doing it is we're in the
business of providing space services when people ask for it,'' he
said.
   NASA has twice repaired satellites in space _ in 1984 and 1985 _
and brought back two other disabled spacecraft.
   ``For this to be practical, a satellite that's in trouble has to
be within the reach of the shuttle, in the altitude region,'' Green
said.
   Discovery's flight in April with the Hubble Space Telescope set
a record altitude _ 380 miles _ for a shuttle. A shuttle probably
could reach 400 or so miles without any cargo, Green said.
   Intelsat, a Washington, D.C.-based consortium of 119 countries
that operates a global communications satellite system, was not
interested in having the satellite returned to Earth for repair
because of the expense and delay in getting it back up.
   The Intelsat VI satellite was to have replaced two older
Intelsat satellites over the Atlantic. Once in proper orbit, it
will be capable of transmitting three TV channels and up to 120,000
telephone calls simultaneously.
   Intelsat's service will not be disrupted by the three-year
delay, Trujillo said. Fourteen Intelsat satellites currently are in
orbit, and a Titan 3 is scheduled to carry up another one later
this month.
   Martin Marietta Corp., which makes the Titan rockets, said the
engineering design error that led to the failed launch in March has
been corrected.

<HEAD>Senate Passes Bill to Restrict Logging in Tongass National Forest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate voted unanimously today to restrict
logging in Alaska's huge Tongass National Forest.
   The bill would set aside 673,000 acres as permanently protected
wilderness areas, modify two long-term harvesting contracts to
pressentially the same as those on
which Mrs. Helmsley, 70, was convicted in federal court last year.
   Mrs. Helmsley is appealing the federal conviction and sentence
of four years in prison and $7.1 million fine.
   A state indictment charges Mrs. Helmsley and her billionaire
real estate developer husband Harry with tax and business fraud.
Most counts alleged they renovated, furnished and operated Dunellen
Hall, their estate in Greenwich, Conn., while charging those
personal expenses to their businesses.
   Harry Helmsley was found unfit to stand trial in the federal
case. State charges against him remain since the double jeopardy
rule does not apply.
   One of Mrs. Helmsley's lawyers, Sandor Frankel, asked Bradley to
order Mendez to give the defense a ``bill of particulars,'' which
specifies exactly what she is accused of doing, for the remaining
eight counts.
   ``What is the crime?'' Alan Dershowitz, another Helmsley lawyer,
asked outside court. ``What did she do wrong? They keep telling us,
`You'll find out at the trial.'''
   Mrs. Helmsley, in a white Chanel knit suit and white patent
leather pumps, again protested her innocence. ``We paid our
taxes,'' she said. ``It isn't fair. It's an outrage. It's a shame.
It's a disgrace.''
   Bradley said he will rule on June 20 on the various
applications, including a defense petition to dismiss four of the
eight remaining counts. He said he also will decide, after
receiving physicians' reports and the lawyers' papers, whether he
will hold a hearing on Harry Helmsley's mental and physical fitness
to stand trial.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher and his Soviet counterpart, Eduard Shevardnadze, plan to
meet in West Germany next week to try to resolve a dispute over a
united Germany's military status.
   The two will meet on Monday in the northern city of Muenster,
the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
   Genscher and Shevardnadze held talks on the issue in the Soviet
city of Brest on Monday.
   The Soviets reject NATO's insistence that a united Germany
belong to the Western alliance.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has suggested as a
compromise solution that a merged Germany have ``associate''
memberships in NATO and the Warsaw Pact, but that has been rejected
by both Washington and Bonn.
   In Muenster, in addition to the NATO dispute, the two men will
discuss the ``long-term perspectives of German-Soviet relations,''
the Foreign Ministry statement said.

   After a year on the loose, a rooster that
evaded traps and tranquilizer darts was finally captured by three
pursuers working under the cover of darkness and armed with a
flashlight and a fishing net.
   Henry the rooster's owners moved away a year ago.
   During the past few weeks, animal control officials intensified
their efforts with traps and the tranquilizer guns because Henry's
droppings were suspected of infecting a child at The Playhouse day
care center.
   Monday night, day-care center director Geri Moton, and her
son-in-law, Kevin Pike, took matters into their own hands. Joining
them was Russell Burkett, grandfather of a child who was recently
enrolled at the center.
   ``This was their first day at The Playhouse and Mr. Burkett
said, `Honey, I'll help you get that rooster but we'll have to do
it at night,''' Moton said.
   They found Henry in a tree. Taking advantage of roosters' poor
night vision, Pike climbed up and knocked Henry to the ground.
   The pesky bird made a dash for freedom, but Moton nabbed him
with a fishing net.
   ``He's gone and this morning I sang the Hallelujah chorus,''
Moton said Tuesday.
   Burkett is keeping the rooster as a companion for his grandson,
Raymond Shollanbarger.
   ``I didn't want him shot,'' Moton said. ``I'm just glad the
rooster found him a good home.''
   She said Henry's owners moved last year and left him behind.
   Gaston health officials wanted the bird removed because stray
animals are a violation of day-care health standards.
   The health department became involved two weeks ago when a
pediatrician reported a case of campylobacter infection, a
bacterial disease that causes flu-like symptoms. Animal feces is
one source of the infection and officials said the illness might
have come from the rooster.

   President Vaclav Havel of Czecholovakia on
Wednesday won the 1990 Simon Bolivar Prize from UNESCO for his long
struggle to lead his country to freedom, the organization said.
   The prize, awarded every two years by the U.N. Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization, recognizes those who
contribute to the liberty, independence and dignity of a people.
   Havel fought for democracy at the price of his own liberty, the
jury ruled. The dissident playwright jailed by the Communist
government before his release and rise to lead a new non-Communist
government last year.
   The prize carries an award of $25,000. It is named after the
South American patriot who liberated much of the continent from
Spanish rule in the early 19th century.

   They've been kicked out of motels, forced to live
on charity and lost their animals.
   But members of the Great Circus Bim Bom, who say a U.S. business
sabotaged their tour, still want to perform for the Americans who
have opened their homes, hearts and checkbooks to the stranded
Soviet performers.
   ``We want to perform for you, but we cannot get our equipment,
our animals,'' said Emil Kio, a magician known for his acts with
fire. ``That is a pity.''
   The 115-member circus, named for two famous turn-of-the-century
Russian clowns, came to the United States for a two-year tour in
March.
   The group signed a contract with International Showbusiness
Inc., a newly formed company in Clearwater, Fla., with financing
from Kuwaiti investors. It brought the troupe to the United States
and scheduled performances.
   The venture starting losing money because of poor publicity,
circus director Yuri Turkin said.
   The circus came to Atlanta, where its trucking company is based,
to regroup and assess its plight, only to be kicked out of a series
of motels for not paying bills. Finally, the tour was canceled May
9 after only 12 performances.
   ``Lies, lies, lies, that's all they told us,'' a bitter Leonid
Gordon, technical director for Kio's magic act, said of
International Showbusiness. ``We waited two months for them to do
something. They didn't tell us anything until we were in trouble.
Now we have nothing.''
   Thirty performers stuck with ISI and got lodging at a West
Virginia ski resort but no work.
   Turkin severed ties with ISI and is frantically trying to
arrange performances in Kentucky before Friday morning, when the
troupe must leave its latest home, Atlanta's Oglethorpe University.
   To perform, the circus must pay to free its equipment and
animals.
   Night Moves Transfer of Atlanta is owed about $165,000, and vice
president Winfield Ward said he must have a large percentage of the
money before he will release the equipment. ``I'm not a bank, I'm a
trucking company,'' he said.
   The 54 animals _ including a pregnant lion whose cub that Kio
said the circus wants to donate to Atlanta's zoo when it is born _
are being held by the Alex Nichols Agency in Newburgh, N.Y.
   Federal officials, meanwhile, are threatening to seize the
animals because wildlife declaration documents weren't filed when
they entered the country.
   ``We know our Soviet laws but we don't know all you Americans
require,'' Kio said, blaming ISI for not providing documentation.
``This is not our debt. This is International Showbusiness debt.
Because they won't pay, we are here.''
   ISI attorney Robert Bauer Jr. did not return calls seeking
comment. The company's president, Nikolaj Vissokovsky, has in the
past blamed a Kuwaiti father and son for withdrawing financial
support. But Brooks Savage, a lawyer for Waleed A.A. Ahmad and his
father, Khoorsheed Ahmad, said the investors gave the circus a loan
and never intended to back the whole tour.
   The performers have been biding their time at Oglethorpe
University, which offered free housing during a student break. Most
are frustrated that they can't practice.
   Vechislav Anokhin, who juggles large steel balls, misses working
with his own equipment. ``I must stay strong for my work. Every day
I go to the gymnasium, but it is not the same,'' he said.
   They try not to appear ungrateful to Atlantans who buy them food
and spend time with them, despite the language barrier.
   Some, like trainer Kalachov Yevgeni, are making good friends.
   ``He's teaching me Russian and I'm teaching him English,'' said
7-year-old Ryan Haroldson as the two practiced boxing. ``He's my
`droog,' friend.''
   ``Ryan tells us what's happening,'' Yevgeni said in Russian.
   But the Soviets are tired of waiting. They want to send in the
clowns.
   ``We wait and hope, wait and hope,'' said musician Mikhail
Kolotovkhine. ``There's nothing else.''

   Michigan State University tore down
several plywood shanties that were erected on campus to promote
various causes, and campus police arrested five students who
protested the move.
   Administrators had let the students keep the shanties up for
several months, university spokesman Terry Denbow said.
   He said students violated an agreement that they not sleep
inside the shanties.
   ``We do have an ordinance to enforce. We have gone along with
these groups who have violated a university ordinance all spring,''
he said.
   Denbow said eight different groups _ which had erected the
shanties to raise awareness on issues including racism and
homelessness _ had agreed to remove them on Monday.
   Three complied, but five didn't, so the university took action
Tuesday, sending in 15 campus police officers. They ordered out
eight students in makeshift beds and dismantled the structures.
   ``It was an act of cowardice for the university to take down the
shanties after all the students have left and before the press was
awake,'' said Albin Rose, one of the eight forced out.
   Kenneth Overton, 21, was arrested after climbing atop an A-frame
shanty to prevent groundskeepers from toppling it. He later was
released.
   He was arrested again later in the day along with four others
for allegedly violating the school's camping regulations _ a
misdemeanor. All five pleaded innocent and posted bond.

   Georgette Mosbacher, socialite wife of the U.S.
secretary of commerce and head of a cosmetics company she owns, was
robbed of $30,000 in jewelry and cash outside her hotel room by a
man with a submachine gun.
   Mrs. Mosbacher said she gave the robber her jewelry and handbag,
then escaped when an elevator opened and she jumped in.
   ``I was screaming and yelling and leaning on the buzzer,'' Mrs.
Mosbacher said after the Tuesday robbery. ``When I got to the
lobby, I ran to the desk. I was hoping they could lock off the
stairs and catch him.''
   The robber fled. No arrests have been made, police said
Wednesday.
   Mrs. Mosbacher said the well-dressed robber covered her with the
small submachine gun and told her to open her door.
   She said she told him the key wouldn't work, but he got it open.
   ``I told him `I'm not going there. I'm not going to shout.'
   ``I took off my earrings and said, `There's a bench over there
and I'm going to sit.' I said to myself, `I'm not going to live,'
but I thought I'd have a better chance in the hallway,'' she
recalled.
   The gunman's hands were occupied with jewelry and Mrs.
Mosbacher's bag when the elevator door opened and Mrs. Mosbacher
took her chance to get away.
   The robber got her wedding band, two other rings, a watch, $400
in cash and the earrings, she said. She said the valuables were
worth $30,000.
   Mrs. Mosbacher was staying at the hotel while the couple's
apartment is being renovated.

   Ted Turner apologized on his own Cable News
Network for calling Christianity ``a religion for losers.''
   Turner, appearing on CNN's ``Crossfire'' program Tuesday night,
said he was speaking off the top of his head when he made the
comment.
   ``I want to officially apologize to all the Christians for
saying that,'' Turner said. ``That was a very uncalled-for
statement. At one time or another, I've offended just about
everybody. I was making a talk off the cuff when that just popped
out, and I feel very sorry for it.''
   Turner met earlier in the day with Chinese student leader Shen
Tong, 21, who was offended by something Turner said last month.
   Shen said he was unable to persuade Turner to lend support to
his country's democracy movement.
   ``He don't want to be involved. He don't want to contribute,''
Shen said. Shen sought the meeting after Turner said the Chinese
government ``felt forced'' to quell democracy protests with
military strength that left hundreds of demonstrators dead.
   Turner's remark about Christianity was first made last year and
repeated last month at a convention of the American Humanist
Association, where he was named Humanist of the Year.
   Despite his apology, Turner said Tuesday night he has problems
with organized religion because of what he perceives as its
inflexibility.
   ``The thing I don't like about all organized religion is, I've
never seen one yet that didn't think they were right and it was the
one true way,'' he said.

   Itinerant Grateful Dead fans are going to have
trouble finding spots to rest their heads around the time of the
group's July 8 concert at Three Rivers Stadium.
   The city won't let them sleep in the arena's parking lot and a
northern suburb adopted a resolution banning all camping for the
first two weeks of July.
   The resolution adopted Monday by the Reserve Township Board of
Commissioners bans all camping out, including sleeping in tents or
any vehicle, in the township from July 1 to July 15.
   ``We don't want any problems,'' said Andrew Perlik, board
chairman. ``The city has cracked down on their fans, which has
forced them to the suburbs.''
   At least 25 people were arrested when about 500 of the band's
fans clashed with Pittsburgh police outside the stadium in April
1989.

   At the Betsy Ross House, where Flag Day is a
sacred holiday, those who celebrate the stars and stripes' creation
have strong views about its destruction.
   But stitching an amendment onto the Constitution to stop people
from burning Old Glory had some workers and visitors at the house
knitting their brows with concern.
   ``Patriotism is in the heart and can't be legislated,'' said
Seta Demurjian, 57, of Cherry Hill, N.J., a guide who escorts
people to Philadelphia's historic sites.
   ``Once you start monkeying around with the Constitution you open
up a lot of problems,'' said Ms. Demurjian, who suggested Congress
had more pressing issues to worry about.
   Passion about the issue was re-ignited this week after the U.S.
Supreme Court decided Monday that a federal law making it a crime
to burn the flag violated free speech protections in the Bill of
Rights.
   After the decision, President Bush renewed his call for a 27th
amendment to the Constitution to make flag burning a crime.
   A big celebration is scheduled for Flag Day at the Betsy Ross
House, complete with fife-and-drum corps and the reading of an
essay by 14-year-old competition winner Katie Appleget of Princeton
Junction, N.J., on ``What the Flag Means to Me.''

   A nuclear weapon with up to 11 times
the explosive force of the atomic bomb that devastated Hiroshima
was detonated underground Wednesday at the Nevada Test Site. It was
the second announced test this year.
   Stephen Ledogar, the U.S. ambassador to the International
Conference on Disarmament, joined test controllers and other Energy
Department officials in viewing the test by closed-circuit
television at a control point 32 miles from ground zero.
   The Energy Department announced Monday that the test would have
an explosive yield of 20 to 150 kilotons of TNT. The bomb dropped
on Hiroshima in 1945 produced a blast of 13 kilotons.
   Tests are announced in advance when they will reach near the
upper limits. Managers of high-rises in Las Vegas are warned by the
Energy Department not to have workers in precarious positions at
the time of the blast. All tests are announced as being less than
20 kilotons, or 20 to 150 kilotons.
   The test was the first since March 10.
   Last year, 12 nuclear weapons were exploded underground at the
desert site. In recent years, the Energy Department has tested an
average of about one nuclear weapon a month.
   The test was the 701st since testing began at the site in 1951.

<HEAD>Scientists Find Genetic Defect Responsible for Albinos</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have discovered a specific genetic
defect that causes the pale skin and white hair of people who are
albinos.
   The discovery should help doctors tell parents before birth
whether their babies are likely to have this inherited condition.
   Doctors from the University of Wisconsin studied a family in
which four sisters were albinos, but their parents and brothers had
normal skin color.
   They found that the sisters inherited two different genetic
mutations, one from each parent. The defects were in a gene that
makes a protein essential for skin color.
   The researchers screened 15 other unrelated albinos, but found
that only one of them had the same defects. They believe that many
different mutations in this gene may cause albinism.
   The research, conducted by Dr. Richard A. Spritz and colleagues,
was published in Thursday's issue of the New England Journal of
Medicine.
   Albinism results from defects in the gene that oversees the
body's production of tyrosinase. Tyrosinase is needed to make
melanin, the pigment that gives color to the skin, hair and eyes.
   In the severest form of the disease, albinos have white hair,
milky white skin and pale blue eyes. They are also likely to have
poor vision.
   About one in every 17,000 people in the United States is albino.

   Leaders of Israel's new
right-wing government said Wednesday they are willing to make peace
with the Palestinians, but first want a new understanding with the
United States.
   Foreign Minister David Levy and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
said they wanted American guarantees that Israel would not have to
speak to the PLO or discuss any Palestinian state in U.S.-proposed
peace talks.
   ``Deal with us as allies. ... First we have to reach an
agreement on these things, and then other things can certainly be
achieved,'' Levy said at a ceremony in Jerusalem formally
installing him as foreign minister.
   The new Cabinet won parliamentary approval Monday, ending three
months of political uncertainty that followed the collapse of the
Labor-Likud coalition over U.S. proposals for Palestinian-israeli
talks in Cairo.
   Shamir said he wouldn't talk to Palestine Liberation
Organization representatives or Arabs from Israeli-annexed east
Jerusalem on ending the Palestinian uprising, which began in
December 1987.
   At least 717 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians, and 45 Israelis have died in the violence.
   Levy insisted the new leadership would not ``torpedo'' peace
talks.
   ``This is not an extremist government ... but you have to
understand us. This is not an issue of experiments. There is no
people that makes experiments concerning its survival,'' Levy said.
   Another major irritant in U.S.-Israeli relations is Jerusalem's
insistence on expanding Jewish settlement in the occupied
lands,which Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East war. About 70,000
Jewish settlers now live in the West Bank.
   About 750,000 Soviet Jews are expected to enter Israel over the
next years as Soviet emigration laws loosen. So far, about 300
Soviet Jews have settled in the West Bank.
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens on Wednesday supported the
government's controversial settlement policy by visiting the West
Bank's two largest Jewish communities, Maale Adumim and Ariel.
   ``I think it's only proper that I should visit here on my first
day of touring as defense minister,'' Arens told leaders of Maale
Adumim, a settlement of about 13,500 just outside Jerusalem.
   ``Ensuring the security of the (settlers) is one of the most
important objectives of our government,'' Arens said.
   But Shamir, in an interview published Wednesday in the
English-language Jerusalem Post, denied his government would build
new settlements in the occupied lands.
   ``The emphasis will be on the ... strengthening of the now
existing settlements,'' Shamir said.
   Settlement leaders said Maale Adumim was expected to grow by
6,500 residents by 1992. Another settlement located south of
Jerusalem, Efrat, was to grow tenfold to 20,000 people by the
decade's end.
   Shamir also told the Post he would not discuss formation of a
Palestinian state in any peace talks.
   Speaking of the United States, Shamir said: ``I want them to
understand our intentions, and I want to make it clear that a
dialogue between Israel and Arab representatives ... cannot succeed
without prior agreement between the parties that the goal is to
advance within the framework of ... autonomy.''
   Shamir said Wednesday that peace talks with the Palestinians
could not succeed unless the Arab world joined the dialogue. In the
past, all Arab states except Egypt have refused to negotiate with
Israel.
   The remarks by Shamir and Levy indicated that Israel's new
government, like the last one, will refuse proposals made earlier
by Secretary of State James A. Baker III for the dialogue in Cairo.
   Hard-liners in Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc, including Levy,
said the proposals were an attempt to bring the PLO to the
negotiating table.
   In a May 1989 peace plan, Shamir called for elections in the
occupied lands in which Palestinians would choose representatives
to negotiate limited autonomy. After some years, the final status
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip would be discussed.

the line once and for all that determines an exact boundary of the
Lone Star State _ and they'd rather do it Sooner than later.
   The Red River has served an official divider between the two
since Spain and the United States signed a treaty in 1819 to set
the southwest boundary of the Louisiana Purchase.
   But they've been wrangling in courtrooms and state capitals for
years over which bank _ north or south _ sets the boundary along a
110-mile stretch of river.
   The U.S. Supreme Court tried to settle the question in the early
1920s by issuing four opinions, which set the boundary at the
river's south bank, the Texas side.
   However, each time the course of the river's flow is altered,
usually by flooding, new quarrels arise.
   The confusion has caused disputes over taxes, mineral rights and
law enforcement jurisdiction.
   So once again, Texas and Oklahoma officials and the federal
Bureau of Land Management will try to resolve the issue.
   The federal agency will present a proposal this summer to
officials from both states, Paul Tanner, area manager for the
Bureau of Land Management's Oklahoma City office, said this week.
   Tanner predicts the boundary will be fixed at a permanent spot
on the Texas side of the river. If that happens, Oklahoma stands to
gain acreage and increase its tax base, he said.
   The stretch is in the central part of the boundary and runs in
Texas from about Byers to Oklaunion.

<HEAD>Labor Leaders Endorse Proposed Ban On Strike Replacements</HEAD>

   Organized labor leaders urged Congress
Wednesday to ban the replacement of striking workers, saying the
practice has eroded the rights of employees to strike.
   But some lawmakers said such a law would unfairly tilt the
collective bargaining process toward unions by leaving companies
with no means of surviving a strike.
   ``Talk about a level playing field .... If this bill passes, one
of the players won't even be invited to the game,'' said Rep. Cass
Ballenger, R-N.C. ``They won't have a ticket to get in.''
   Rep. Harris Fawell, R-Ill., complained that the hearing before a
House Labor subcommittee was one-sided because the only witnesses
were labor officials.
   Committee chairman Rep. William Clay, D-Mo., said opponents of
the measure, which he is sponsoring, would be asked to appear later.
   Clay said he wanted corporate managers at Eastern Air Lines and
Greyhound Lines Inc. _ two companies that quickly hired
replacements at the onset of labor disputes _ to tell Congress
``why they would be so ruthless in replacing workers, some who have
been with them 25 years.''
   The House labor-management relations subcommittee is considering
a measure that would bar companies from keeping replacement workers
if union workers with more seniority wanted their jobs back after a
strike was settled. A similar measure is pending before a Senate
committee.
   Those testifying included Greyhound union president Edward M.
Strait, who said the bus line's promise of permanent jobs for
replacement workers was a ``major obstacle'' in the resolution of
the 3-month-old drivers' strike.
   Strait's Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions
represents the 6,300 drivers who walked off their jobs March 2 over
wages and job security. He said the proposed change was needed to
``redress a fatal flaw'' in federal labor law that allows companies
to replace workers who exercise their legal right to strike.
   Greyhound, which filed for bankruptcy protection last week, has
been operating a reduced schedule with about 3,000 replacement
drivers.
   In an interview from the bus line's Dallas headquarters,
Greyhound spokesman George Gravley said the issue of replacement
workers was a ``sideshow'' in the dispute. He said contract
negotiations have failed because of unreasonable wage demands by
the union.
   The hiring of permanent replacement workers, once considered
taboo, has become more widespread in recent years. Many in
organized labor trace the increase in permanent replacements to
President Reagan's firing of striking air traffic controllers in
1981.

   The Soviet legislature voted to further speed the
nation toward a market economy Wednesday, but a government official
told lawmakers that an threefold increase in bread prices would be
delayed.
   Panic-buying has emptied many store shelves since late last
month, when the Communist government proposed to cut many price
subsidies by January.
   Prices on bread, the main staple of the Soviet diet, also will
be raised eventually, but ``of course, not by July 1,'' said Yuri
Maslyukov, chairman of the government agency that runs the
centralized economy. Bread now sells for less than 30 cents a loaf.
   The Supreme Soviet, ordering the fine-tuning of a plan that drew
widespread criticism as being too vague and tentative, instructed
the Council of Ministers to have drafts of all the laws needed for
the switch from a planned to a market economy by October.
   The measure also instructed President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to
issue a series of presidential decrees beginning July 1 to speed up
progress on bringing new laws on ownership, leasing, farming and
other key elements of a market economy into effect.
   ``The main thing now is that now we can begin to work,'' said
leading economist and Deputy Prime Minister Leonid Abalkin.
   ``Three years ago someone who called for a market economy was
pointed at _ `There's a man who's betraying the ideals of
socialism!''' he said. ``Today everyone's talking about how to make
the transition faster.''
   Abalkin, speaking to reporters at the Supreme Soviet, said the
government still intends to raise most prices on retail goods and
raw materials in January as stated in its earlier plan, despite
consumer outcry.
   The Supreme Soviet heard Maslyukov's proposal Wednesday to
postpone the price increase on bread and was expected to vote on it
Thursday.
   Maslyukov recommended the postponement largely because the plan
for compensating the population for the extra money they would have
to spend on bread still needed work. But he said nine of the 15
Soviet republics already have agreed to increase their bread prices
Aug. 1, with compensation beginning about two weeks earlier.
   Wednesday's resolution did not reject outright the program put
forth by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov late last month, which focused
on price rises. But it demanded quick, concrete plans for creating
a market and immediate spending cuts on defense, the government
bureaucracy and construction to cut the budget deficit.
   ``We have to begin work now,'' deputy Alexei Boiko, who
presented the resolution, told lawmakers.
   Ryzhkov and his government were forced to rethink the plan after
it prompted panic buying and drew nearly unanimous criticism by
economists around the world for raising prices without freeing
enough goods and prices from government control to allow a true
transition to a market economy.
   Wednesday's resolution set an October deadline for Gorbachev's
administration to hammer out concrete reforms, including bills to
create a stock market, commercial banks, credit and a federal
reserve bank. Deputies changed the draft to remove the specifics of
which laws were needed, but said the list still applied.
   Ryzhkov told reporters he supported the altered plan. ``The
project was worked on by commissions and is fairly objective, and
allows us to work further,'' he said.
   But he said it would be difficult to complete all the laws and
practical measures by the autumn deadline.
   Ryzhkov admitted he was surprised at the swell of sentiment
against the price increases. He said he knew it would be difficult,
but ``to tell the truth, I thought society was more prepared.''
   Asked about calls for his resignation due to the outcry, Ryzhkov
said: ``It's not a question of who works on this program. I'm
convinced this is the road we have to take.''
   Opposition economist Gennady Filshin criticized Wednesday's
proposal as a compromise among government economists unwilling to
take the radical steps needed. His Inter-Regional Group, the
opposition in the Soviet Congress, proposed much more radical
measures, including liquidating all ministries and freeing up
prices altogether.
   Other deputies took the floor Wednesday to blast the proposal as
well, many speaking against the overall price increases. But the
resolution passed nonetheless in a series of votes on each article.
   Boiko said the Parliament would keep a close eye on the
government's fulfillment of the resolution, and if by fall it had
not made satisfactory progress, ``we will be forced to make the
corresponding verdict.''

<HEAD>Regulator Says Bailout Agency Needs More Money from Congress</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government's savings and loan bailout
agency will run out of borrowing authority in the October-December
quarter, bringing thrift rescues to a halt unless Congress provides
more money, a top regulator said Wednesday.
   ``Obviously if we don't have any money, we can't continue,''
said L. William Seidman, previewing congressional testimony to be
delivered Thursday by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
   Seidman is chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., a
10-month-old agency responsible for closing and selling failed
thrifts.
   Three weeks ago, Brady roughly doubled the Bush administration's
estimate of the cost of bailing out S&amp;Ls to a range of $89 billion
to $132 billion.
   Brady's latest disclosure that the RTC soon will run out of
operating funds, to be delivered to the House Banking Committee,
lends new urgency to negotiations between administration and
congressional leaders on the budget for fiscal year 1991, which
begins Oct. 1.
   It means Congress must provide substantial additional money in
the budget or face a halt to thrift rescues within weeks of the
start of the new fiscal year.
   Seidman, responding to reporters' questions at a news conference
on an unrelated matter, indicated his agency has at least enough
borrowing authority remaining to rescue another 95 to 120 S&amp;Ls.
   That would leave as many as 500 failed institutions still open,
but under government control.
   Since it began operating in August, the RTC has ``resolved'' 168
failed thrifts by paying off depositors or by selling the
institutions to new investors.
   It plans another 45 resolutions by the end of June and expected
to handle 50 to 75 in the July-September quarter, Seidman said.
   At the end of last week, the RTC had control of 295 failed S&amp;Ls
awaiting resolution. Thrift regulators have indicated at least
another 299 institutions still operating independently appear
headed for failure.
   S&amp;L legislation enacted in August authorized the RTC to borrow
$50 billion through long-term bonds to cover the losses in failed
S&amp;Ls. The resolutions through the end of this month should use
about $30 billion of that money.
   The RTC has also been authorized to borrow an additional $45
billion in short-term working capital until it can sell the real
estate, securities and other assets it is inheriting from failed
institutions.
   Seidman said the agency had not decided how much working capital
it will borrow in the July-September quarter. The total amount of
short-term borrowing is capped by a complex formula in last year's
law and Seidman indicated that cap would be reached before the end
of this year.
   ``We will be out of funds enabling us to do transactions,'' he
said.
   Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. said
Monday that Congress probably would have to act later this year to
provide new money ``probably in amounts comparable'' to the $50
billion in long-term borrowing authorized by the law.

<TEXT>
   German officials in the East and West teamed
up to capture the second top leftist terrorist suspect in a week,
and news reports on Wednesday said more such arrests were expected.
   West German authorities hailed the joint effort that led to the
arrest of 46-year-old Inge Viett, and East Germany's interior
minister called it an example of ``success in German-German
cooperation'' following decades of enmity.
   The East German minister, Peter-Michael Diestel, also promised
to investigate the extent to which his country's former Communist
government _ particularly its hated secret police _ had harbored
West German terrorists.
   ``It's a perverse situation that in the past, terrorists were
protected in the German Democratic Republic,'' Diestel told
reporters in Bonn.
   The secret police, once virtually omnipresent, would have known
the background of any West Germans resettling in East Germany. Many
suspected the secret police, or Stasi, had provided the terrorists
with new identities and other help.
   If so, Diestel said, it was a ``diabolical connection.''
   The government-run East German news agency ADN said Ms. Viett,
wanted in several attacks, was captured Tuesday night in the East
German city of Magdeburg.
   It immediately led to speculation that other members of the Red
Army Faction would turn up in East Germany, or that they once lived
there.
   ``East Germany's chief prosecutor's office is optimistically
looking forward to the speedy capture of other terrorists,'' said
West Germany's ZDF television network.
   ZDF also said there are indications of ties linking East
Germany's secret police and West German terrorists with Middle East
terror groups.
   Law enforcement sources in Bonn, speaking to The Associated
Press on the condition of anonymity, said there were indications
that Ms. Viett had worked with Palestinian terrorists in the 1970s.
   Ever since the two Germanys started their rapid road to
unification last fall, the question of terrorism has become
increasingly important.
   Officials on both sides of the crumbling barriers have warned
that East Germany could provide fertile territory for new leftist
terrorist crimes.
   Joint efforts were stepped up to capture any Red Army Faction
members who may have slipped across the border after a series of
attacks that rocked West German industry in the 1970s and 80s.
   The West German federal police worked with their counterparts in
East Germany to capture Ms. Viett unarmed in her apartment in
Magdeburg, where she had lived for more than two years.
   Sources said Ms. Viett's neighbors notified authorities, after
seeing West German wanted posters with her picture that had been
put up throughout the city. East German police carried out the
arrest, and West German authorities arrived in Magdeburg afterward.
   Ms. Viett's capture and the June 6 apprehension of another
suspect, Sussanne Albrecht, represent some of the biggest successes
against West German terrorists in years.
   The West German newspaper Bild said that officials in East and
West were close to arresting terrorist suspect Silke Maier-Witt in
East Germany.
   ``Every day, we are counting on seeing the news of her arrest,''
Bild quoted one unidentified West German official as saying. Bild
is known to have close ties to government security officials in
Bonn.
   Earlier, the Morgenpost newspaper of Dresden reported that Ms.
Maier-Witt had lived in that East German city. She is suspected of
having taken part in the 1977 kidnapping and murder of prominent
West German industrialist Hanns Martin Schleyer.
   Ms. Viett's alleged involvement in terrorism goes back to 1972,
when she was accused of taking part in a bombing that killed one
man at a boating facility in Berlin.
   West German authorities have accused Ms. Viett of taking part in
the slaying of prominent West Berlin Judge Guenter von Drenkmann in
1974.
   Ms. Viett is also wanted in the kidnapping of West Berlin
Christian Democratic leader Peter Lorenz a year later, among
numerous other crimes.
   In 1978, she allegedly took part in helping Red Army Faction
member Till Meyer escape from a Berlin prison.
   Ms. Viett in 1981 allegedly shot a French policemen, after being
stopped by authorities in Paris. The policeman was seriously
injured.
   West German officials announced plans to seek the extradition of
Ms. Viett, as they are doing in the case of Ms. Albrecht.
   Ms. Albrecht is wanted in the 1977 murder of prominent West
German banker Juergen Ponto.

<HEAD>U.S. Training of Lebanese Military May Resume</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is prepared to resume
a military training program for Lebanon once that country repays
more than $8 million in overdue loans to the United States, U.S.
officials said Wednesday.
   John T. McCarthy, ambassador to Lebanon, outlined the U.S.
position last week at a meeting in Egypt with Lebanese President
Elias Harawi, the officials said.
   Lebanon is ineligible for U.S. assistance because of the
repayment arrearages. The suspension went into effect in 1988.
   Harawi told McCarthy he believes the debt problem can be
resolved, paving the way for a resumption of the training program,
said the officials, who spoke on condition they not be identified.
   U.S. military training programs normally are administered by the
local American embassy. Because the embassy in Beirut has been
closed, the officials said other arrangements would have to be made
to train Lebanese troops when the program is restored.

   The reigning Mr. Universe faces
federal charges of conspiring to smuggle anabolic steroids into the
United States, prosecutors said Wednesday.
   Matthew Dufresne, 24, of Hampden was indicted by a federal grand
jury in Springfield on Tuesday on charges of conspiring to import
steroids from Belgium and with possession of 5,000 doses of the
drug.
   In October 1989, he was chosen Mr. Universe by the North
Atlantic Body Building Association. He was only the second person
to win that title in the same year he was named Mr. America.
   Anabolic steroids are used to build muscles and stamina, but can
have dangerous side-effects and are banned by international
athletic organizations.
   The indictment charges that Dufresne went to Belgium last
October and gave $500 in cash to an unidentified individual. On
Jan. 5, Dufresne ``removed a package containing anabolic steroids
and labeled `X-mas gifts. Toys!''' from a post office box in
Hampden, the indictment charges.
   Court officials said no arraignment date has been set for
Dufresne, who faces a maximum sentence of 13 years in prison and
fines totaling $260,000 if convicted, said Assistant U.S. Attorney
Bertha D. Josephson.
   Dufresne did not return a telephone message left at his home
Wednesday by The Associated Press.

<TEXT>
   The mayor of Eureka, Calif., on Wednesday
sportingly swallowed his city's designation as the nation's
heartburn capital.
   ``We'll long remember you and the occasion,'' Mayor Fred Moore
gamely told company officials as he accepted a plaque placing
Eureka at the top of the National Rolaids Heartburn Index.
   The Heartburn Index blames that searing sensation on sociology,
not spices. It says Eureka in Northern California is Heartburn City
because, among other reasons, it's attracting newcomers with a
burning desire for economic success.
   ``Isn't this bonkers?'' said the mayor's wife, Madelon Moore.
``Everybody at City Hall went crazy.''
   El Paso, Texas, had the lowest heartburn rate among 197
metropolitan areas.
   And how do El Paso residents perceive this great honor?
   ``With a certain bit of levity, probably,'' said City Councilman
Gene Finke, who accepted his city's plaque.
   The study chalked up El Paso's tummy-taming qualities to a
stable population and a rebounding economy. Finke also credited
strong family values and friendliness.
   Finke swore that nary a twinge has been blamed on his city's
spicy Tex-Mex cuisine.
   ``Maybe they're stoics,'' said Jack Levin, sociology professor
at Northeastern University in Boston, who did the study for Rolaids.
   Actually, Levin's heartfelt, if theoretical, findings did finger
factors other than food for the nation's 40 million heartburn
sufferers.
   ``I think there is a tendency on the part of Americans to blame
heartburn on spicy foods _ Mexican or Szechuan, for example,'' said
Levin. ``From a sociological standpoint, it appears heartburn
levels can be easily linked to the amount of population growth that
a city is experiencing.''
   He said there could be other factors, such as the October
earthquake in Northern California.
   Levin digested sales figures for various antacid brands, tablet
and liquid. Then, he ranked the nation's heartburn hotbeds.
   The sales statistics were not revealed. But, on average,
Americans experience heartburn twice a week, he said. In contrast,
the 25,000 folks in Eureka, 280 miles north of San Francisco, are
plagued an average of four times a week.
   After Eureka, the most seething cities were San Francisco;
Chico, Calif; Santa Barbara, Calif.; Sacramento, Calif.; Boise,
Idaho; Reno, Nev.; Fresno, Calif.; Bakersfield, Calif., and Seattle.
   The least were in El Paso; Fort Smith, Ark.; Ada, Okla.;
Colorado Springs, Colo.; Columbia, Mo.; St. Joseph, Mo.; Lubbock,
Texas; Panama City, Fla.; Springfield, Mo.; and Albany, Ga.
   New York City ranked 135th.
   ``The most startling result in this analysis was that the
Northeast region did not have high heartburn ...,'' said Levin.
   Levin also singled out Midwestern cities characterized by
``stability and tradition,'' like Springfield, Mo. (103); Green
Bay, Wis. (184); Lansing, Mich. (181) and Sioux City, Iowa (186).
   Perhaps to prove a point, the results were unveiled at a lunch
of chicken marinated in tequila, shrimp marinated in chili, salad
with cilantro dressing, tacos and refried beans.
   As a hedge, there were post-dessert ``Rolaids for everyone,''
said spokeswoman Ann Forster.

<TEXT>
   A recount began Wednesday in Nebraska's
Democratic gubernatorial primary, nearly a month after election day.
   Unofficial returns from last month's voting gave attorney Ben
Nelson of Omaha a 41-vote victory over Bill Hoppner of Lincoln, an
attorney-businessman and former aide to U.S. Sen. Bob Kerrey,
D-Neb. The close margin forced an automatic recount, which is
expected to take several days.
   ``What we're anticipating is that there have been some errors,''
Hoppner said.
   The winner will face Republican Gov. Kay Orr, the nation's first
woman Republican elected governor, who is seeking a second term.
   There is no apparent record of such a recount in Nebraska
history.
   Nelson spokesman Sonny Foster said the recount seemed to
increase the interest of volunteers who wanted to serve as
observers for the candidates at recount sites.
   ``We have about 150 people grumbling because they didn't get to
participate in this historical process,'' Foster said. ``This is
history in the making, a first for Nebraska, and they wanted to be
a part of it.''

   recent months to alleviate traffic flow and make way for new
developments. But most of West Berlin still remains surrounded by
fortifications.
   The U.S. military in West Berlin said Wednesday arrangements are
not yet complete for the removal of the famed Checkpoint Charlie
through the Berlin Wall. The building had been scheduled to close
Thursday.
   The Berlin governments chose Bernauer Street for the ceremonial
start of the wall's final demolition because of the chilling images
it gave the world.
   Shortly after the wall began going up, some occupants of nearby
buildings jumped into bedsheets held open by West Berliners.
   A 77-year-old woman hung from a window ledge for 15 minutes
while Communist Party functionaries tried to pull her back, at one
point throwing a smoke grenade at the crowd below. They finally let
the woman drop into a bedsheet.
   In 1964, some West Berliners dug a tunnel under Bernauer Street
and 57 East Germans escaped.
   A 90-year-old church that straddled the border, which contained
a plaque with the names of East Germans who died while trying to
flee, was blown up by Communist authorities in 1985. They cited
border security as the reason.
   Helmut Frankan ran a bar a block away when the wall was being
erected. In the first few weeks, as the fortifications were still
being built and strengthened, one of his waitresses used to climb
over the wall to visit her mother in West Berlin.
   ``One day the guards caught her and punched her in the face. She
spent a year and a half in prison,'' said Frankan, 66, as he kicked
through the gravel where houses once stood.
   ``They tore down all of these houses. They even moved a
graveyard.''

<HEAD>IRA Suspected In Bombing Of Home Used By Conservative Party Figure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTLEY WINTNEY, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bomb blew a hole in the
recently vacated home of a leading Conservative Party figure, and
police said Wednesday that they suspected the IRA carried out the
attack.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said the explosion Tuesday
night at West Green House _ an 18th century mansion in this
southern English village _ was ``very disturbing.''
   No one was hurt in the blast, and no organization immediately
claimed responsibility.
   The Irish Republican Army, in a new offensive aimed mainly at
British targets outside Northern Ireland, has killed seven people
in the past few weeks and mounted half a dozen attacks in England.
   The explosion tore a three-foot hole in the front of the
mansion, which until three weeks ago was the home of Lord McAlpine,
a former deputy chairman and treasurer of the Conservative Party
and major fund-raiser.
   McAlpine, 48, is a close associate of Mrs. Thatcher and
neighbors said she has been a guest at West Green House, 55 miles
from London.
   ``We are keeping an open mind,'' Hampshire police Detective
Superintendent Alan Wheeler told a news conference. ``But because
of the size of the explosion there is only one organization I know
of which causes such explosions, and that is the IRA.''
   McAlpine was on a target list of more than 100 prominent
Britons, including judges, found in a police raid 18 months ago on
a apartment used by IRA bomb-makers in south London.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
the predominantly Protestant province of Northern Ireland and unite
it with the republic of Ireland.
   Police said at first they suspected animal rights extremists,
but they focused later on the IRA. McAlpine's interests include a
zoo in Broome, Australia.

   Sales of North American-made cars and trucks by
the nation's Big Three automakers plunged 15.5 percent in early
June, compared with the same period last year, the companies said
Wednesday.
   The drop came as automakers tried to wean consumers from costly
incentives. The number of vehicles covered by incentives and the
amounts of rebates offered June 1-10 were lower than the same
period were lower than during the same period a year ago.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said
they sold vehicles at an average daily rate of 28,073 during the
period this year, compared with an average of 33,223 during the
same time in 1989.
   Car sales skidded 19.2 percent and truck sales dropped 9.3
percent.
   Through June 10 of this year, Big Three car and truck sales were
running 7.7 percent behind last year's pace, dropping to a daily
sales rate of 32,474 from a rate of 35,1273 a day last year.
   Car sales for the year were down 10.8 percent and light truck
sales were off 2.6 percent.
   Chrysler's early-June vehicle sales were 18 percent lower than
last year's. Car sales dropped 16.7 percent and sales of light
trucks, which provide much of the company's profits, were off 19.1
percent. The company's vehicle sales so far this year declined 13
percent from last year; car sales dropped 18 percent and truck
sales fell 8.2 percent.
   GM said its combined early-June car and truck sales were 16.7
percent behind last year's pace with car sales down 19.2 percent
and sales of light trucks off 11.3 percent.
   So far this year, GM has sold 4.8 percent fewer vehicles than
last year, with car sales down 7.5 percent and truck sales up a
slight 0.8 percent.
   Ford reported a 12.4 percent drop in early-June car and truck
sales, with a 20.2 percent decline in car sales blunted by a .5
percent increase in truck sales. Ford spokesman Joel Pitcoff said
sales of the company's new Explorer sport-utility vehicle was the
main reason for the increase in truck sales.
   Since Jan. 1, Ford's vehicle sales are down 8.8 percent, with
car sales off 12.7 percent and truck sales showing a 2.8 percent
decline.

   Dick Tracy, the comic book detective with a two-way
wrist radio, would be pleased.
   A Japanese company says it plans to introduce a wristwatch with
a pager capable of carrying short messages on a liquid-crystal
display.
   The Seiko Receptor, which took four years to develop, is
scheduled to debut next month in Portland, Ore., at an introductory
price of $255 and may gradually appear for $275 in other U.S.
cities, Hattori Seiko Co. spokeswoman Noriko Kuriyama said
Wednesday.
   The company also is studying plans to expand sales to Europe and
Asia, she said.
   Like Tracy's famous radio, the new wristwatch pager receives
radio signals. The Receptor translates the radio waves into written
messages up to 16 characters long. Many U.S. pager companies
already provide similar services for beepers, but these devices
aren't contained in a wristwatch.
   The wristwatch pager is manufactured by Seiko Epson Co., a
Hattori Seiko subsidiary. It can store up to eight messages.
   The Receptor will be marketed in the United States through AT&amp;E
Corp., a San Francisco-based telecommunications company.
   In 1983, Seiko introduced a wristwatch-sized color television.
But the TV required an auxiliary tuner about the size of a small
cassette tape player.
   Seiko hopes to sell 1 million wristwatch pagers in the next
three years, Ms. Kuriyama said.
   The Seiko model will have competition from a wristwatch pager
that Motorola Inc. and Timex Corp. expect to introduce later this
year. That model was announced last year by the two companies.

   A former U.S. Marine private who fled to
Canada after basic training ended 21 years of self-exile Wednesday
and surrendered Marine authorities.
   Ron Jacko, a Cleveland native who has lived in Toronto since
1969, turned himself in at the Marine base in Quantico, Va., said
Capt. Betsy Sweatt.
   Jacko, 42, said he would ask the base commander, Lt. Gen. W.R.
Etnyre, to allow him to avoid a court-martial and leave the Marine
Corps with an ``other-than-honorable discharge.''
   If, after an investigation, Etnyre grants that request, Jacko
could be free in a few weeks, Sweatt said. ``Every case is handled
individually,'' the spokeswoman said.
   In the meantime, the Marines will check Jacko's background to
make sure no other charges are pending against him.
   He will not be imprisoned but will be confined to the base,
living in a barracks with other privates.
   ``He'll be treated as any other Marine PFC,'' Sweatt said.
``He'll be in what's called a casual status. He can see his
civilian lawyer any time he needs to and a military lawyer will
also be assigned to assist him.''
   Returned deserters are no novelty at Quantico. ``We average
about three a week,'' she said.
   Before heading for Quantico, Jacko met with the member of
Congress who represents his old neighborhood, the west side of
Cleveland.
   Afterward, Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, said she would ask the
base commander to consider Jacko's case ``justly, fairly,
expeditiously and compassionately.''
   ``He convinced me that it was a matter of conscience for him,''
said Oakar.
   Jacko said he considered returning for several years, and
finally was convinced to turn himself because of the failing health
of his mother, Marge, who still lives in Cleveland.
   ``She just went through three operations in about the last six
months,'' he said. ``I want to be able to be there.''
   Jacko married a Canadian woman and has supported himself by
managing health food stores in Toronto.
   He had not tried to return before Tuesday, when he met a lawyer
from the New York-based group Citizen Soldier and made the rounds
of Washington news offices, trying to attract publicity and in turn
improve his case.
   Jacko's wife, Nadia, did not accompany him, but he said she
would join him in his new home after his release.
   Jacko said he opposed the Vietnam war from the outset, but
decided to enlist in hopes of pulling an assignment in which he
could avoid being sent to the Southeast Asian country. .
   Assignment to communications school convinced him he was likely
to be shipped to Vietnam. He fled to Canada while on leave after
basic training, but said he was never able to forget that he was a
fugitive and was eager to put that behind him.
   ``It's not an easy feeling,'' he said.

   Sen. Dave Durenberger apologized Wednesday to
his colleagues and constituents, saying he takes ``full
responsibility'' for ethical lapses even though he never set out to
break the rules.
   Shortly after he spoke, the Senate Ethics Committee abruptly
ended its trial-like hearing into Durenberger's financial conduct
and accepted 23 volumes of evidence against the Minnesota
Republican.
   The committee will now weigh a recommendation by its special
counsel, Robert S. Bennett, that Durenberger be denounced by the
Senate for financial improprieties.
   In an emotional, hour-long speech, the senator told the
committee his ``life and reputation'' are at stake and said he
would rely on the committee's ``good judgment and compassion.''
   The committee had scheduled up to two weeks of hearings, but
went along with a request from Durenberger's attorney, Jim
Hamilton, to end the hearings early because a prolonged proceeding
would cost the senator too much in legal fees.
   The panel's vice chairman, Sen. Warren B. Rudman, R-N.H., said
the committee would have no problem making a judgment based on
written documents and statements by Durenberger, his lawyer and
Bennett.
   ``There is not a great deal of dispute about the facts,'' Rudman
said. ``There's obviously a great deal of dispute about what those
facts mean.''
   A decision is not expected for several weeks. Bennett said it
would likely take him two weeks to submit his formal recommendation.
   Durenberger, speaking softly in a voice that faltered but did
not break, attributed his lack of attention to ethics rules, in
part, to the ``strains and vulnerabilities in my personal life.''
   Standing at a microphone and often looking straight at the six
senators sitting in judgment of him, described the pain of raising
four sons after his first wife died of cancer at the age of 31, and
his marriage to his current wife, Penny, whose first husband had
died in the Vietnam War.
   But, Durenberger said in his address to the hushed hearing room,
these factors were ``not an excuse'' for breaking Senate rules. ``I
... accept full responsibility for errors which were made,'' he
said.
   ``I recognize that real damage has been done by what has been
perceived as my desire to push the limits and take advantage of the
Senate, and for that I am sorry,'' he said.
   Durenberger combined his appeal for compassion with a defense
that he had made mistakes but that ``all the key decisions'' had
been taken with legal advice.
   As had been the case when Bennett made his case against
Durenberger on Tuesday, the committee had no visible reaction to
the senator's presentation.
   After he finished, Durenberger hugged his son Dan, his staff
members and embraced fellow Minnesota Republican Sen. Rudy
Boschwitz.
   Durenberger spoke on the second day of trial-like hearings in
answer to Bennett's recommendation that he be denounced by the full
Senate because, Bennett said, Durenberger had intended to break its
rules and the law.
   The committee has found ``substantial credible evidence'' that
Durenberger committed violations of Senate rules and the law.
Bennett said Durenberger abused his office by:
   _Evading honoraria limits when he classified money earned from
appearances before trade groups as his payment for promoting his
two books.
   _Hiding his ownership in a Minneapolis condominium so he could
collect travel reimbursements when he stayed there.
   _Accepting free limousine rides from special-interest groups in
violation of a $100 annual gift ceiling from people or groups
interested in legislation.
   Durenberger said he would not challenge the committee's
recommended punishment, but he appeared to rule out resigning.
   ``When this is done, I intend to serve this body and my home
state with a renewed conviction to exemplify the servant in public
service,'' he said.
   If the Senate follows Bennett's advice, it would pass a
resolution denouncing him for ``reprehensible'' conduct _ an action
that would not effect his Senate standing or duties.
   Senators also could issue a mild rebuke, strip him of seniority,
take away committee assignments or even expel him _ unlikely in a
case without serious violations of criminal law.
   ``I acted in good faith and with no intent whatsoever to violate
the rules of the Senate,'' Durenberger said. ``I know that in my
heart to be the case.''
   Bennett listened to Durenberger and began his rebuttal by
stressing it was ``difficult to follow such an eloquent and
touching moment.''
   ``No human being in this room can feel good right now,'' he
said. ``Certainly I don't. But let's get back to the facts.''
   He then ripped into Durenberger's arguments, saying that the
senator ``knowingly and intentionally committed acts that were
unethical.''
   Bennett, repeating an allegation he made Tuesday that
Durenberger's speeches were honoraria appearances and not book
promotions, told the committee:
   ``Sen. Durenberger knew when he spoke'' and didn't have any
books with him ``this wasn't a book promotion. So let's keep our
eye on the ball here. If there have been book promotions we
wouldn't be here.''
   Bennett said he asked Durenberger and his attorney, Jim
Hamilton, to show him ``one event where the senator was asked to
promote his book. I have not received that evidence.''
   Political leaders in Minnesota, including state Republican
chairman Robert Weinholzer, have said there could be pressure for
him to resign if the Senate gives him a serious punishment.

<HEAD>Science Minister Wants Mediterranean-Dead Sea Canal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Science Minister Yuval Neeman on Wednesday
proposed reviving a plan for a canal from the Mediterranean Sea to
the Dead Sea that was shelved five years ago as impractical and too
costly.
   Neeman, a physicist who headed a project to plan the route of
the proposed canal in 1981, said the decision to cancel the project
was made too hastily and ``without depth.''
   ``The canal can solve the problem of the Dead Sea,'' Neeman told
Israel radio. ``A big part of the Dead Sea is already desert.''
   The plan to build the 70-mile so-called ``Dead-Med canal'' was
announced in 1980. It caught the imagination of Israelis because
Theodore Herzl, the visionary who conceived the modern Jewish
state, urged building such a canal as early as 1902.
   The 1980 plan had two purposes: to generate electricity and to
refill the evaporating Dead Sea, actually a lake laden with salt
and chemicals through which runs the Israeli-Jordanian border.
   Electricity was to be generated by using the force of the water
as it flowed down to the Dead Sea, which at 1,097 feet below sea
level is the lowest point on earth.
   When the project was canceled in 1985, Energy Minister Moshe
Shahal said the canal would be too expensive because falling oil
prices had reduced the cost of generating electricity.
   Energy officials estimated then that the project would be
feasible only if oil cost $32 a barrel. Today the price is about
$15 a barrel.
   By 1985 the projected cost of the canal was estimated at $1.5
billion.
   The decision to stop the canal project also involved other
considerations. Neighboring Jordan claimed the project would
threaten its chemical works on the east bank of the Dead Sea.
   There were also fears that pumping ordinary sea water into the
Dead Sea would change its unique quality that allows swimmers to
float on the surface. The oily, chemical-laden water is also sought
out by health enthusiasts who believe it has medicinal value in
treating skin diseases.

   A House subcommittee approved legislation
Wednesday to scale back exemptions from federal antitrust laws the
insurance industry has enjoyed for 45 years.
   On a 9-6 partisan vote, the Judiciary Committee's subcommittee
on economic and commercial law approved a bill to subject insurance
companies to federal court lawsuits for price fixing and other
antitrust provisions.
   All Democrats on the panel voted for the bill and all
Republicans voted against it.
   Insurance companies and their agents have enjoyed immunity from
antitrust suits under the 1945 McCarran-Ferguson Act, which
delegated regulation of the now $500 billion industry to state
governments.
   The bill clearing its first legislative hurdle Wednesday was
prompted by the 1985 insurance upheaval in which companies quit
writing liability coverage for various occupations because of
massive claims and judgments against them.
   A similar bill was approved by the subcommittee in 1988 but got
nowhere because of intense opposition from the insurance industry.
   This time, however, Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, the full
committee's new chairman, is determined to bring a bill to the
House floor.
   Citing opponents' claims that the industry is so competitive
that no antitrust laws are needed, Brooks said Wednesday, ``If
that's so, then there is nothing to fear'' from the bill.
   In addition to price fixing, the legislation would, after a
five-year transition, make other alleged abuses by insurance
companies grounds for federal antitrust lawsuits.
   They include dividing up geographic territories among competing
companies and ``tying'' requirements, such as forcing a buyer to
purchase home insurance in order to get auto coverage.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, has introduced similar
legislation in the Senate. However, the industry is counting on
opposition from Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and Howell Heflin,
D-Ala. _ both, along with Metzenbaum, members of the Senate's
judiciary committee _ to prevent its passage.

   The Department of Energy will use money that
once financed scholarships for university nuclear engineering
students to help schoolchildren improve science and math skills, an
official said Wednesday.
   James Decker, acting director of the DOE's Office of Energy
Research, told a House Science, Space and Technology subcommittee
that the shift resulted from ``tough budget decisions'' made for
fiscal year 1991.
   The administration decided to move about $6 million from
university nuclear engineering research programs and scholarships
to ``place greater emphasis on pre-college'' science and
mathematics programs, he said.
   ``There is a growing consensus that one of the most serious
problems facing the nation over the next 10 years is the declining
number of young Americans, including women and minorities,
interested in pursuing careers in science and engineering,'' Decker
said.
   ``DOE is uniquely positioned to provide major assistance to the
national effort to strengthen science and engineering education,''
he added.
   The Energy Department has traditionally supported science
education at the graduate and postdoctoral levels. Its university
research in fiscal year 1990 totals about $480 million.
   Richard Stephens, director of DOE's University and Industry
Division, said the department had worked closely with 57
universities that have nuclear engineering programs providing
degrees ranging from bachelor's to doctorates.
   There are 36 active projects with an average of three graduate
students, each receiving the scholarships. Stephens stressed that
none of the current scholarship recipients will be affected by the
budget switch because for each of the three years of the program,
three-year awards were granted.
   Besides developing pre-college mathematics and science education
programs at the DOE laboratories around the country, Decker said
there also will be a travelling museum-based science education
program consisting of exhibits on major energy-related scientific
programs, increased research appointments for teachers and minority
high school students and an expansion of special engineering
programs for middle school students.
   Decker said that special emphasis for the new fiscal year will
be on the development of partnerships between DOE laboratories and
inner-city and rural schools, mainly middle and high schools with
high drop out rates.

<HEAD>House OKs $4 Billion AIDS Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved
a $4 billion AIDS bill that would provide emergency money for
cities and states to deal with the deadly disease.
   The bill, approved on a 408-14 vote, is more expensive than the
$2.9 billion Senate version passed last month. A conference
committee will be appointed to work out differences.
   Bush administration opposes the House bill both because of its
cost and the precedence set by passing legislation aimed at one
specific disease.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., likened AIDS to natural disasters
that have prompted Congress to appropriate money to local
governments.
   ``This bill says to cities like New York, which has 25 percent
of the total AIDS cases in the country, that we understand your
problem ... (and) we are going to help,'' Schumer said. ``Hospitals
are collapsing with the financial burden placed on them (by AIDS.)''
   The House bill authorizes $400 million in each of the next five
fiscal years for grants to provide a variety of AIDS preventative
health services. Half the money would go to state governments, and
the rest directly to health care facilities.
   It authorizes another $275 million a year for two years and
``such sums as may be necessary'' for the next three fiscal years
to go directly to cities with the largest number of AIDS cases.
   Besides New York, other cities expected to receive emergency
grants under the bill are: Atlanta; Boston; Chicago; Dallas;
Houston; Jersey City, N.J.; Los Angeles; Miami; Newark;
Philadelphia; San Diego; San Francisco; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and
Washington, D.C.
   The bill authorizes smaller amounts for a series of other AIDS
projects, including $20 million a year for research into helping
pediatric patients and state grants to buy drugs for treatment of
AIDS and related conditions.
   The House adopted amendments that scaled back the estimated
five-year cost of the bill from $4.6 billion to about $4 billion,
as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.
   However, it rejected amendments that would have required states
to test all citizens annually for the AIDS virus, and that would
have required institutions that test for the virus to report to
state health authorities anyone who tests positive.
   ``The bill's narrow disease-specific approach sets a dangerous
precedent, inviting treatment of other diseases through similar ad
hoc arrangements,'' the White House Office of Management and Budget
said in a written statement.
   ``This approach also runs counter to the government's existing
health care financing system, which will provide more than $870
million in federal Medicaid payments for HIV disease in 1991,'' it
said.
   The administration statement said the bill's cost was excessive
and doesn't target funds to the needy.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is spread most often through
sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers,
infected blood or blood products, and from infected pregnant women
to their offspring.
   The 14 members voting against the bill, all Republicans, were:
   Philip Crane, R-Ill.; John Duncan Jr., R-Tenn.; Mickey Edwards,
R-Okla.; Mel Hancock, R-Mo.; Clyde Holloway, R-La.; Duncan Hunter,
R-Calif.; Jon Kyl and Bob Stump of Arizona; Ron Marlenee, R-Mont.;
Carl Pursell, R-Mich.; Dan Schaefer, R-Colo.; Gerald Solomon,
R-N.Y.; and Robert Walker and George Gekas of Pennsylvania.
   Ten congressmen did not vote. They were: Reps. Bill Frenzel,
R-Minn.; Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif.; Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass.; New
York Democrats John LaFalce and Charles Rangel; Jim Lightfoot,
R-Iowa; Romano Mazzoli, D-Ky.; Bill Nelson, D-Fla.; Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill.; and Denny Smith, R-Ore.
   There are two vacancies in the House, and the speaker
traditionally does not vote.

   The White House on Wednesday applauded
Moscow's decision to ease its economic blockade against Lithuania,
and President Bush said he hoped the Soviet Union was beginning to
defuse the crisis over the Baltic republics.
   Bush said it was ``good news'' that Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev had met Tuesday with the leaders of Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia, which are trying to break away from the Kremlin's control.
   ``I hope that what we saw yesterday is a first step in a
dialogue that will lead to the self-determination that we strongly
support,'' Bush said at a news conference.
   He said the United States hopes for a ``peaceful resolution of
this confrontation, one that will result in dialogue, negotiation
... in lifting of this economic blockade against Lithuania.''
   The economic sanctions, imposed two months ago to break
Lithuania's drive for independence, have been a stumbling block in
U.S.-Soviet relations.
   After Bush spoke, the White House received news of an easing of
Moscow's pressure on Lithuania. ``It's encouraging,'' said Brent
Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser.
   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene was told by
Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov that 15 percent of the
republic's natural gas needs would be restored, Rita Dapkus, a
parliamentary spokeswoman, said.
   Ryzhkov made no promises on restoring other supplies, Ms. Dapkus
said.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We welcome
this announcement. Together with the beginning of the dialogue
yesterday, these are positive steps.''
   However, Sen. lfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., blasted Moscow. ``I think
15 percent is a slap in the face; you're trifling with people,'' he
said. ``The embargo remains in place.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said, ``I am
hopeful that the Soviet Union will lift its economic blockade
against Lithuania and I welcome Soviet steps toward that end. Both
sides should exert every effort to ensure that negotiations are
conducted in an equitable and respectful manner.''
   Bush declined to comment on the eported easing of economic
pressure when questioned during an afternoon photo session.
   Earlier, Bush opened a news conference with regional reporters
by praising Gorbachev's meeting with the Baltic leaders. He said it
was a ``significant change that's occurred in the Soviet Union.''
   He said, ``I don't want to overstate it but I was very, very
pleased to see this occur in the wake of our _ what I think was a
successful summit meeting.''
   Reporters diverted the news conference to other subjects, and
did not ask Bush any questions about Gorbachev and Lithuania. Two
environmental subjects _ offshore oil drilling and the fate of the
northern spotted owl _ were addressed by Bush.
   He said the long-delayed decision on restricting oil drilling
off the coasts of Florida and California would be made within days.
   Bush said he wanted to make sure he had all the information he
needs. ``We're still getting opinions,'' the president said. ``It's
a very hot item, as you know.''
   Bush said that protection of the northern spotted owl under the
Endangered Species Act left him ``very much concerned about the
potential loss of jobs.''
   Vast tracts of forest would be shut to timber operations if the
owl is deemed endangered, and the president said the law gives the
administration ``very limited control'' in making such a
determination.
   On other subjects, Bush said:
   _The Soviet Union should stop subsidizing the government of
Cuba, which he said receives $5 billion a year. ``If that
totalitarian and brutal society were not propped up by an enormous
subsidy from the Soviet Union, I have every reason to believe that
Cuban people would have a right to achieve the freedom that other
countries have achieved.''
   _The United States will not normalize relations with Iran until
``all of our hostages are out'' of Lebanon. Six Americans remain
captive. On a related question, Bush said ``we aren't sure where
the guilt lies'' in the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 that killed
270 people in December, 1988.
   _He was concerned about the financial problems suffered by
Greyhound but said the problem of supplying transportation to rural
American should be resolved by supply and demand, not federal
intervention.
   One questioner said Bush's son Neil had contributed to the loss
of $106 million by taxpayers through his involvement with a failed
savings and loan and asked how the son should make restitution,
Bush said, ``I don't accept your premise at all and I don't think
the Congress does, either.''
   Neil Bush was on the board of Silverado Banking, Savings and
Loan Association in Denver from October 1985 to August 1988. The
Office of Thrift Supervision alleges that loans from Silverado to
Bush's business partners were a conflict of interest for him. He
has denied wrongdoing and is contesting an effort by the thrift
office to discipline him. Silverado collapsed in December 1988.

<TEXT>
   A prominent U.S. monitoring group says police
and members of the security forces are responsible for most human
rights violations in Mexico, the official news agency Notimex said.
   Americas Watch said in a report made public Wednesday that the
war on drugs is often used as a pretext for murder, torture and
extortion.
   It said the special anti-narcotics division of the federal
judicial police has one of the worst rights records, especially in
the northern states of Sinaloa, Durango and Chihuahua.
   A spokesman for the Mexican Attorney General's office said
Tuesday night it had no comment on the report, copies of which were
released early. The federal judicial police are an arm of the
attorney general's office.
   Americas Watch said that police and security force corruption
and violence threaten Mexico's national security.
   The 115-page report, ``Human Rights in Mexico: A Policy of
Impunity,'' also said some rights violations are political.
   It said labor strife, election disputes and land battles, which
often pit the party that has ruled Mexico for 61 years against its
opponents, have spawned assassinations, disappearances and illegal
detentions.
   Americas Watch cited the cases of several journalists who have
been murdered and said some of its informants had received threats
from police officers.
   The report by the New York-based group criticizes the United
States for ignoring Mexico's poor record on human rights. It blamed
the indifference on a desire for cordial relations with Mexico.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Arab League expressed anger Wednesday at
Vice President Dan Quayle for calling Israeli-occupied lands
``Judea and Samaria,'' the Biblical names used by Israeli
nationalists seeking to rule those territories.
   In a speech Monday to the annual convention of the
American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, a major pro-Israel
lobbying group, Quayle described two trips he took to Israel. On
one, Quayle said, he was taken by helicopter to the West Bank of
the Jordan River, an area which Israel captured from Jordan in the
1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   ``From the hills of Judea and Samaria, you can see the land of
Israel stretched out before you,'' Quayle said in his prepared
remarks. He was referring to the strategic location of those hills,
which command a view of Israel's most populated area and the
Mediterranean Sea beyond.
   Israel cites the narrowness of the corridor between the hills
and the Mediterranean as one reason why it needs to control the
West Bank, whose Palestinian population wants independence from
Israeli and Jordanian control.
   Clovis Maksoud, the ambassador of the 21-nation Arab League,
said he had asked President Bush to clarify Quayle's remarks.
   Maksoud said he had asked whether the Bush administration now
accepts the definitions of Israeli hardliners, such as Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, for the occupied territories.
   U.S. officials generally refer to the West Bank, as well as to
the Gaza strip which Israel captured from Egypt in 1967, as the
occupied territories. The United States does not recognize Israeli
sovereignty over those lands and urges negotiations on their
future. It views Jewish settlements in those areas as an obstacle
to peace.
   ``There has been no change in policy,'' said Quayle's spokesman,
David Beckwith. ``The vice president was just using the Biblical
names of those hills.''
   ``If the U.S. administration is to hold the PLO responsible for
any and all statements and actions by its representatives, we also
hold the Bush administration responsible for statements made by its
vice president,'' Maksoud said.
   The administration has demanded the Palestine Liberation
Organization condemn an aborted May 30 raid by one of its factions
on Israel's coast.

   The rapper says it's racism and the sheriff swears
it isn't _ but the obscenity crackdown on 2 Live Crew is sparking a
national debate about selective prosecution.
   ``This has nothing to do with racial overtones of any kind,''
said Broward County Sheriff Nick Navarro, whose deputies have
arrested two members of the rap group and a record-store owner on
obscenity charges in connection with the album ``As Nasty As They
Wanna Be.''
   A third member, Mark Ross, was served with court papers
Wednesday. The group, which was taping talk show appearances in New
York, also has come under fire by authorities in Texas and Georgia.
   ``It's just an attack on my company and on me as a black guy,''
said 2 Live Crew's leader, Luther Campbell, who also owns the
Miami-based group's record label.
   ``I think the role that race plays is really indirect and it
might work in any number of ways,'' said John Leland, music critic
for Newsday in New York. He was an expert witness at the federal
trial in Fort Lauderdale that resulted in last week's obscenity
declaration by U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez.
   Leland noted there were no complaints about the Crew's music
until the group's first pop radio hit, ``Me So Horny,'' which
brought them to the attention of mainstream audiences last fall.
The sexually explicit album is the group's third.
   ``In order for something to be declared obscene it has to be
declared lacking in serious artistic value,'' the critic said
Wednesday. ``I think that what you have with 2 Live Crew is really
a new art form that presents all sorts of creative possiblities
that people who aren't sympathetic to the music aren't able to
understand.''
   He said the lack of understanding cuts across age lines as well
as racial ones.
   ``Part of the reason 2 Live Crew has been singled out and
persecuted is because they're relatively powerless,'' said Robyn
Blumner, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union
in Florida.
   ``This is an independent record company which is disaffected in
part from the record industry establishment, so they're an easy
target. Part of that is because they're a minority business.''
   Leland agreed.
   ``The popular music industry left Luther Campbell and 2 Live
Crew out to hang,'' the critic said.
   The group's raps have been criticized for sexist, prurient and
violent references.
   Members of the black group and some of its supporters maintain
that the songs spring from life as they've known it on inner-city
streets.
   ``They're expressing resentment, they're expressing anger, fear
_ emotions that are projections of their own culture,'' said Peter
Thall, a New York attorney who represents entertainment figures.
   ``All artists write out of their experiences,'' said University
of Florida media law professor Colleen Sullivan, who is writing a
book on rock lyrics and the First Amendment. ``I think it's
appalling that this is their experience.''
   Navarro says his department has had no other complaints about
the group, not even since last week's ruling, whose effects is
limited to three south Florida counties.
   But in San Antonio, Texas, police this week began notifying 84
record stores that the lyrics of ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' are
obscene, said vice squad commander Lt. Jerry Pittman.
   Police said no arests would be made for at least five days, but
stores have begun removing the albums.
   In Gwinnett County, Ga., Police Chief Wayne Bolden said
Wednesday he and about 15 officers will monitor two Thursday
concerts by the group.
   ``(They're) talking about arresting us, the club owner and the
managers,'' said Chris Lyons, one of the promoters. ``I don't think
Gwinnett wants to fool with this. It's bordering on racism.
   ``Look at all the rock groups who get away with (slurs) of
homosexuals and immigrants,'' Lyons said, ``and nobody says
anything about that.''

   The House Appropriations Committee on
Wednesday approved the entire $318 million recommended by President
Bush for the super collider particle accelerator.
   The money is contained in a $20.9 billion appropriations bill
for federal energy and water projects in the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1 that should reach the House floor next week.
   The measure passed the committee on a voice vote with little
discussion.
   The Energy Department is expected to make another estimate of
the collider's cost, now put at $8 billion, later this summer. The
House has voted to limit the federal share to $5 billion, and the
department is seeking foreign contributions.
   The collider will be a 54-mile underground tunnel south of
Dallas where proton beams are smashed into each other to probe the
secrets of matter at 20 times the energy possible today.

   The U.S. government has illegally hidden from
Manuel Noriega's lawyers thousands of secret intelligence documents
seized in Panama, a defense attorney charged Wednesday.
   A five-page list found by a private investigator shows that
during the U.S. invasion in December, the Army confiscated dozens
of file cabinets, said Michael O'Kane, attorney for Noriega
co-defendant Daniel Miranda.
   O'Kane said the file cabinets contained Panamanian G-2
intelligence files, weapons import-export records, confidential
correspondence and files on Noriega foes who plotted a coup.
   The list is far more extensive than an inventory turned over to
the defense by the U.S. attorney's office, O'Kane said.
   ``This (government) inventory is a fabrication,'' O'Kane said
before he filed a motion Wednesday in federal court to force the
government to hand over a revised list.
   He called the government inventory ``a coverup effectuated in
Panama by unknown elements within the government of the United
States.''
   Noriega is being held on drug-smuggling charges.
   Attorneys for the ousted Panamanian dictator have insisted that
many of his activities were sanctioned by the United States. They
have said that U.S. and Panamanian intelligence records would show
he cooperated with the CIA and the Drug Enforcement Administration.
   The prosecution's shortened list violates an order by U.S.
Magistrate William Turnoff for the government to provide the
defense with a complete list of documents seized during the
invasion, O'Kane said.
   O'Kane said there was no indication the U.S. attorney's office
in Miami knew its list was sanitized. He said prosecutors also may
have been misled by U.S. officials in Washington or Panama.
   Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office, said she
would not have any immediate comment on the motion.
   Jon May, an attorney for Noriega, said the general's defense was
eager to examine the lists and documents when the question of their
fees is resolved. The defense attorneys say the government must
free Noriega's frozen funds to provide adequate resources for his
defense.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler has scheduled a hearing for
June 20 on the question of Noriega's legal fees.
   The disputed records are in the custody of the U.S. Southern
Command's 470th Military Intelligence Group at a warehouse in
Corozal, Panama. O'Kane said he sent a private investigator to the
warehouse to rummage through boxes of documents listed by the
government.
   ``We found wadded up in one of the boxes as garbage what we
think is the real inventory,'' O'Kane said.
   The five-page list submitted with the motion included about 40
items taken to the warehouse. Most of the items were file cabinets
apparently packed with secret documents, he said.
   ``The government inventory lists only one file cabinet,'' O'Kane
said.
   He said it appeared some of the documents _ such as records of a
coup attempt and Panamanian Defense Force payroll records _ were
removed from the cabinets and submitted in a pile of evidence to
the defense team.
   The defense never heard of thousands of other documents,
however, he said.
   A file cabinet containing ``G-2 target files'' and another with
``G-2 interrogation detention reports'' were listed on the
wadded-up inventory, but missing from the official government
version, he said.
   Also missing were records of cabinets that included files of
arms import-export and explosives companies, although the defense
did get separate records of Israeli arms sales to Panama, O'Kane
said.
   The attorney said many of the missing documents appeared to be
essential records, not marginal items.
   ``From the label it seems these are sensitive things,'' O'Kane
said.
   O'Kane's client, Miranda, is out on bond on charges of helping
to fly drug money from Fort Lauderdale to Panama. If convicted, he
could be sentenced to five years in prison.
   Noriega, confined at the Metropolitan Correctional Center
outside of Miami, faces up to 145 years in prison if convicted of
accepting $4.6 million in bribes from Colombia's Medellin drug
cartel to turn Panama into a safe haven for U.S.-bound drugs.

   The government is offering personalized
computer lists of properties as it begins the second phase of its
campaign to sell repossessed savings and loan real estate.
   Beginning Thursday, the Resolution Trust Corp. will accept
offers on 35,908 properties valued originally at $14.9 billion.
More than half the properties _ 19,067 with a value of $10.2
billion _ are in Texas. The rest are scattered through 45 other
states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
   The RTC, set up by the government to oversee the restructuring
of troubled savings and loan associations is offering mostly
residential parcels _ 29,977 propertlso listing 232
pieces of land and 5,699 commercial properties.
   ``We have everything available from a $15,000 pool hall in
Houston to uranium mines,'' saies. But it is aid Lamar C. Kelly Jr., RTC
director
of asset and real estate management.
   The inventory being released Thursday is current through March
31. In January, RTC released its first list of 30,123 properties,
current through Sept. 30. The agency has sold 13,200 of those,
leaving about 17,000 to be carried over to its new list.
   The first list generated a huge response. The agency sold
180,000 sets of the bulky volumes.
   Kelly said RTC hopes a new marketing strategy  computers can order
CD ROM diskettes,
magnetic tapes or floppy disks. Or they can tap into the RTC's main
frame computer, 24-hours a day. Information on the computer
versions of the inventory is available by calling 1-800-RTC-2990.
   The stepped-up sales effort follows mounting criticism that the
agency isn't selling S&amp;L assets fast enough. RTC has intensified
the closing and sale of failed S&amp;Ls, handling 96 since the first of
April. However, the ``resolutions'' have left the RTC with large
amounts of problem loans and distressed real estate.
   On other fronts, RTC is preparing to auction commercial
properties, each worth more than $1 million, via international
satellite hookup. It also plans to begin ``bulk sales'' of
diversified portfolios. Buyers would get a mixed bag of assets
valued at $500 million or more.
   ``We're open for business,'' Kelly said. ``We don't have any
more poor quality real estate. We have opportunity investments that
haven't been priced properly in the past.''

   Nelson Mandela's call for continued
sanctions on South Africa drew applause Wednesday from the European
Parliament, but his visit also prompted a brawl among parliamentary
members in the chamber's restaurant.
   The black nationalist leader, on a tour of Europe and North
America, said ``profound and irreversible changes'' had not yet
occurred in South Africa despite recent moves toward reform. He
said even a partial lifting of sanctions would be disastrous.
   ``We ... commend this parliament for the role it has played in
the struggle to isolate apartheid South Africa,'' Mandela said.
   Mandela also told reporters the African National Congress needs
``money in buckets'' to continue its bid to end South Africa's
racial segregation policy.
   Mandela is deputy president of the ANC and many parliamentarians
decorated their desks with the ANC's black, green and yellow flag.
   But not all the 518 parliamentarians heard Mandela's 45-minute
address. Absenteeism was highest on the assembly's right-of-center
benches, notably the Liberals, the Conservatives and extreme
rightists.
   French rightists and Belgian Socialist Jose Happart later came
to blows and name-calling in the members-only restaurant over
Mandela's visit.
   Witnesses said Happart was first spat at by Jean-Marie Le Pen,
leader of France's far right National Front, then hit by Bernard
Antony, another French far rightist. They said Happart replied by
kicking Antony in the groin.
   The incident began when Luxembourg Socialist Robert Krieps
commented to a table of ultrarightists on their absence from the
chamber when Mandela spoke.
   Happart said later that Krieps wondered aloud if Mandela's
speech had not ruined their appetite.
   One witness, French Socialist Bernard Thareau, said Le Pen did
not recognize Krieps and asked a guard to remove him.
   Thareau quoted Le Pen, not a frequent attender of the
parliament's monthly sessions, as asking about Krieps, ``Who is
that dog?''
   Happart objected and called Le Pen names.
   Le Pen then spat twice at Happart, who returned to the table he
shared with Krieps and others.
   Thareau said Antony then came over, demanding Krieps identify
himself. He said Happart replied that both he and Krieps were
parliamentarians, at which point Antony grabbed Happart by the
collar and hit him.
   ``So I kicked him in the groin,'' Happart told reporters.
   Antony was said to be short of breath for a while, but finished
his meal. Mandela, who was freed in February after 27 years in
prison, begins his U.S. visit next week. He was convicted of
sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-led government.
   In Brussels last month, President F.W. de Klerk of South Africa
was hopeful the 12-nations European Community will soon end its
sanctions because of the ``dynamic'' changes occurring in his
country.
   EC foreign ministers will discuss the issue next week. The
European Parliament, whose members are elected by voters in EC
nations, has little day-to-day power.
   In 1986, the EC banned imports of iron, steel and gold coins
from South Africa and also banned new investments there.
   Since Mandela's release, Britain has unilaterally lifted the EC
ban on new investment.
   The European Commission _ the European Community's independent
executive with powers of proposal _ on Wednesday asked the EC to
maintain and increase its program of aid to victims of apartheid in
South Africa, but to adapt it to the changes now taking place there.
   The EC has spent $117.6 million on the program since it began in
1986.
   The Commission proposed to spend $50.8 million on it next year.

   Charlie's Meat Products of Amarillo, Texas, is
recalling 18 tons of deli-sliced chicken roll from three
southwestern states because it may be contaminated with food
poisoning organisms, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   The recall involves 36,000 pounds of ``Charlie's Country
Smokehouse German Brand Breast of Chicken,'' officials said.
   The chicken roll is carried by ABCO and Safeway stores in
Arizona, Homeland stores in Oklahoma, Kroger in Dallas and Fort
Worth, Texas, and Homeland and Tom Thumb stores in Texas.
   Ronald J. Prucha, associate administrator of the department's
Food Safety and Inspection Service, said no one is reported to have
gotten sick but that consumers who may have bought the product
should check with the store and return it if necessary.
   The problem was discovered by a USDA compliance officer who
noticed ``a swollen package of the product on display at a
supermarket deli counter in Cedar Hills, Texas,'' the agency said.
``Fifty cases subsequently examined in several stores and
warehouses, all contained swollen product.''
   Agency spokesman Jim Greene said tests had not been completed to
identify the suspected organisms in the product.
   The chicken roll is sold to the stores in 7{-lb. plastic
packages carrying the establishment number ``EST. 13301'' in the
label's USDA inspection seal. The product is shipped in 15-lb.
cartons containing two packages, the agency said. Consumers usually
buy the product sliced at deli counters.

   World sugar production in 1990-91 is expected
to fall short of consumption for the sixth consecutive year, the
Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Production for the year that will begin Sept. 1 was forecast at
107.2 million metric tons, raw value, the report said. That would
be up from 1989-90 output, estimated in March at 105.2 million tons.
   But global sugar use in the coming year is expected to total
109.5 million tons, exceeding production by 2.3 million tons and
indicating another draw-down of stockpiles.
   ``The fastest (consumption) growth is among the populous
developing countries,''' the report said. ``India, China,
Indonesia, Brazil and Mexico will account for 30 percent of global
consumption, compared with 24 percent 10 years earlier.''
   World sugar prices are ``relatively firm'' at this point,
averaging 15.2 cents per pound in April, 14.6 cents in May and 13.5
cents in the first eight marketing days of June, the report said.

<HEAD>Congressman Asks $5 Billion to Stem Drug Use in Families</HEAD>

   The nation should pump $5 billion over the
next five years into social services to stem drug abuse among
pregnant women and to keep families in crisis from falling apart, a
congressman said Wednesday.
   ``We cannot allow the budget crisis to overwhelm the crisis of
America's families,'' said Rep. Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., acting
chairman of the House Ways and Means human resources subcommittee.
   Downey said his Family Preservation Act, introduced with several
co-sponsors, would build on existing programs to prevent drug abuse
among pregnant women, help ``boarder babies'' left in hospitals by
crack-addicted mothers and expand social services to help find ways
to keep families together.
   He estimated it would cost $500 million the first year sounded
undaunted by the intense competition over scarce federal funds.
   The timing of the bill, he said, was intended to take advantage
of upcoming budget talks between congressional leaders and the Bush
administration, to ensure that if taxes are increased, the money
will not be used just to defray the budget deficit.
   The Bush administration's budget to fund the National Drug
Control Strategy calls for about $350 million for prevention and
treatment for pregnant women who use drugs and for their children,
said Daryl Kade of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
   Legislation co-sponsor Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., said the
bill responds to problems unanticipated 10 years ago, such as
widespread drug use, AIDS, child abuse and neglect, that ``have
come together to overwhelm the child welfare system, to overwhelm
the foster care and adoption system in this country.''
   The announcement of the legislation coincided with the release
of a congressional study requested by Downey called, ``The Enemy
Within: Crack-Cocaine and America's Families.''
   The report compiles findings of previously reported studies and
notes that:
   _An estimated 375,000 children born each year are exposed to
some drug while in the womb.
   _More than 100,000 cocaine-exposed babies were born in 1988 and
studies have said that number could reach 500,000 to 4 million by
the year 2000.
   _About 360,000 children were placed in foster care in 1989, a 29
percent increase over 1986, with the largest increases in cities
hit hardest by crack.
   _Despite the publicity over boarder babies, the problem ``may
not be as severe as the media coverage would indicate,'' affecting
only certain hospitals in certain cities. In addition, studies have
found that many mothers remain in contact with their children and
are prevented by authorities from taking them home.

   Reluctant Democrats pushed a constitutional
amendment against flag burning past its first congressional hurdle
Wednesday, just two days after the Supreme Court threw out the
federal flag-protection law.
   Rep. Robert W. Kastenmeier, D-Wis., complained, ``It's unseemly
that we're rushing to judgment'' as the proposed amendment whisked
though the House Constitutional and Civil Rights Subcommittee.
   Supporters of the amendment called the flag a symbol of ``all
that America stands for'' and deserving of special protection,
while critics said that the plan would ``mutilate the Bill of
Rights'' and the entire issue smacked of election-year politics.
   Both sides said if the House were to vote today on the amendment
it would be close. The proposal would have to win two-thirds
majorities in both houses and approval by 38 state legislatures to
take effect.
   Wednesday's subcommittee session re-launched, in a fiery burst
of congressional rhetoric, the proposed amendment that was set
aside last year as Congress passed the statute overturned by the
Supreme Court on Monday.
   The House panel voted 5-3 to send the measure to the full
Judiciary Committee with an ``adverse'' recommendation _ a symbolic
dark cloud that will have no effect on its chances of eventually
being adopted.
   The three Republicans on the subcommittee, all of whom favor the
amendment, voted no on the roll call because they wanted a
``favorable'' recommendation.
   ``You don't see that very often,'' said panel chairman Don
Edwards, D-Calif., an outspoken critic of the plan.
   President Bush passed up a chance to restate the vigorous
support of an amendment that he voiced on Monday _ after the court
ruling _ and again on Tuesday. But his wife Barbara endorsed his
views on the subject, saying ``You're darn right, I'm always with
the president.''
   Bush himself addressed a number of topics with a group of
reporters but didn't bring up the flag.
   Retired Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, who often
has cautioned against adding amendments to the Constitution,
declined to give advice to his former colleagues or anyone else on
the subject as he appeared with Mrs. Bush on the White House lawn
along with students who won a poster contest honoring the
Constitution.
   ``Retired justices shouldn't have any thoughts as to what
present justices should do,'' Burger said.
   At the House subcommittee, supporters and critics alike said the
final decision would be made on the House floor, most likely before
lawmakers go on recess at the end of the month and perhaps much
sooner.
   ``I don't think its going to be an overwhelming vote, but we
will get the two-thirds,'' said Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.,
the ranking minority member of the panel. Edwards merely said it
would be ``very close.''
   The amendment would allow the federal government and the states
to pass laws outlawing burning or other mutilation of the flag.
   The Supreme Court threw out last year's statute barring flag
mutilation, saying it violated the right to free speech.
   Bush had urged a constitutional amendment last year and renewed
that call after the court rejected the statute on a 5-4 vote.
   The first planned Senate action is a Judiciary Committee session
tentatively set for June 21.
   Edwards was asked if Democratic critics of the measure were
hurrying it to the floor before veterans groups and conservative
organizations could mount lobbying campaigns. ``We ought to get it
behind us so we can go on with the country's business,'' he replied.
   He said he was in the Navy in World War II and ``a lot of my
friends were killed and I feel very strongly about it.'' He told of
passing out copies of the Constitution to students in Prague on a
recent trip and how eagerly those young people snatched up the
document.
   ``I hate to think that I'd have to stand before the same
students and say, yes, here's the Bill of Rights, but we've just
weakened it, we've just mutilated it,'' Edwards declared.
   Sensenbrenner said, ``We all love the flag, we all love the
Constitution, we all love the Bill of Rights.'' He scoffed at
complaints about the amendment, saying, ``I don't believe it to be
the outrageous attack on free speech that its opponents believe it
to be.''
   ``It doesn't restrict anyone from saying anything they want to
say about an issue, about a public official, about a candidate for
office,'' he said.
   Rep. Craig James, R-Fla., said the flag deserves special
protection.
   ``The flag represents all that America stands for, it embodies
all the America means,'' he said.
   But Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., said, ``For 200 years as a
nation we have been mature enough to bite our lip when we saw flag
burnings and cross burnings. ... One of the first things Hitler did
was make flag burning a crime in Nazi Germany.''
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., said that there was ``no line I know
of anywhere in the United States waiting to burn the flag.''
   ``This is about the politics of reelection, this is about the
politics of hypocrisy, this is about manipulation of this symbol
for political advantage.''

<HEAD>Ag Department Says Global Corn Prices Causing Concern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is growing uneasiness about global
prices of corn and other coarse grains because of wet spring
weather in the United States, an Agriculture Department report said
Wednesday.
   ``While the outlook for the 1990 world wheat crop continues to
be generally favorable, heavy rains across the major corn-growing
areas of the United States have delayed corn planting,'' the report
said.
   That is ``causing concern in the marketplace about prospects for
the 1990 U.S. crop and _ because of the United States' dominance _
the world's coarse grain price outlook as well,'' the report said.
   In addition, analysts said there had been ``rather strong
late-season import demand'' for coarse grains that ``will result in
a large drawdown in world coarse grain stocks'' during the
remainder of the 1989-90 season.
   On Tuesday, the USDA projected 1990 corn production at 8.1
billion bushels, up from 7.53 billion bushels harvested last year.
Despite the increase in production, total exports and domestic use
are even larger, meaning that the nation's stockpile will dwindle
further in 1990-91.
   Also, the projections are highly tentative and were based on
yield trends and planting indications derived from March surveys.
Wet weather, however, has delayed spring planting and prompted
concern about reduced yields and acreages.
   The department's first official corn estimate won't be released
until Aug. 9, along with prospects for soybeans, sorghum, cotton
and other 1990 spring-planted crops.
   Looking further at the global coarse grain situation, which
includes sorghum, barley and rye as well as corn, the report said
``shifting trade patterns'' are beginning to affect the outlook for
the 1990-91 marketing year.
   ``Crop shortfalls, especially in Brazil, are already influencing
import patterns,'' the report said. ``In addition, foreign
exportable supplies will be limited until new-crop output is
available for export.''
   Thus, it said, there will be continued greater reliance on the
United States for coarse grain, particularly as the 1990 crops
develop.
   According to the projections, corn prices at the farm may
average in the range of $2.35 to $2.75 per bushel in the 1990-91
marketing year that begins Sept. 1. Prices in the current season
are forecast to average $2.35 to $2.40 per bushel.

<HEAD>EPA Officials Promise Faster Action on Great Lakes Cleanup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Bush administration official acknowledged
Wednesday that Great Lakes cleanup programs have lagged and
promised to quicken the pace. Skeptical senators said they had
heard it all before.
   F. Henry Habicht II, deputy administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency, said a heavy workload and the complexity of
developing and implementing cleanup programs for the polluted lakes
were chiefly to blame for the lack of progress.
   ``We have to develop a long-term strategy that is based on good
science and investment,'' Habicht said. ``It's a big undertaking.''
   He told the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management
that the Bush administration opposes writing into law deadlines for
getting cleanup initiatives under way.
   ``We do want to set goals for ourselves, but sometimes deadlines
can have us focus on areas that may not be the top priority'' of
agency experts, Habicht said. ``Our experience indicates that
codifying deadlines does not assure high quality results and raises
unreasonable public expectations.''
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., the subcommittee chairman, said
deadlines were necessary because of EPA's lack of progress in
implementing the 1987 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement between
the United States and Canada.
   Levin is a sponsor of pending legislation that would set
deadlines for the EPA to complete cleanup plans for 42 polluted
areas of the lakes. The provisions are part of a comprehensive
coastal protection bill that cleared the Environment and Public
Works Committee on Tuesday.

   They're forbidden in Florida and taboo in Texas,
but the leader of the 2 Live Crew was welcomed Wednesday for a
fiery, foul-mouthed defense of their salacious million-selling
album ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be.''
   Luther Campbell, the front man for the Florida band, first went
on the offensive during a taping of the ``Geraldo'' show. The
rapper cursed at the sheriff who arrested him and questioned the
credentials of the sheriff's legal adviser.
   ``He hasn't given more to the black community than I have,''
Campbell said of the adviser, then ripped into Broward County
Sheriff Nick Navarro, who was also on the show.
   He then headed from the Times Square taping to Rockefeller
Center for a live bit on the syndicated ``Donahue'' show, where he
was joined by previously censored performers Jello Biafra and Wendy
O. Williams.
   ``I'm a little sick of the system,'' said Williams, who once
wore only electrical tape above her waist at a show. ``What are we
going to do next? What's Luther going to do next? What's Jello
going to do?''
   Campbell kept it clean for ``Donahue,'' although Bob DeMoss _
director of the conservative Focus on Family _ stunned Phil with an
expletive that was heard in some markets where the show is
broadcast live.
   ``I'd like to keep this job,'' Donahue said in asking his guests
to calm down. DeMoss, sitting sheepishly, later apologized.
   The two TV appearances should keep fueling sales of ``As Nasty
As They Wanna Be,'' which are fast approaching the 2 million mark.
A federal judge in Florida last week declared the album obscene.
His jurisdiction is limited to three south Florida counties. San
Antonio store owners pulled the record from shelves this week after
they were threatened with arrest.
   Campbell's outburst will have ``Geraldo'' censors scurrying. He
used, in several forms, one of the more popular obscenities from
his album. Campbell also referred a half-dozen times to a song by
rappers NWA that uses the same word.
   ``It will definitely be our most bleeped show ever. No
question,'' said Jeff Erdel, the publicist for the show.
   Campbell and two other members of the band were arrested Sunday
following a live show at a Florida club. While the judge has called
the Crew's album obscene, Campbell and his supporters claim First
Amendment protection and suggest they are victims of racism.
   ``A white man can say anything. How about Dice Clay?'' Campbell
asked of comedian Andrew Dice Clay, whose material has been
criticized for slurs against women and gays.
   Navarro denied the racism charges, as he has done repeatedly
since the arrests. ``I'm not after anybody because of race,''
Navarro said.
   Luther didn't limit his anger to Geraldo Rivera's show; he
brought a bit along for Phil, too. Campbell became involved in a
shouting match with John Thompson, a Coral Gables, Fla., lawyer who
helped lead the fight against 2 Live Crew.
   ``He's going to be disbarred because he's crazy. ... Why'd you
single us out, man? Why don't you talk about other groups, man?''
Campbell shouted at Thompson.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa on Wednesday
persuaded railroad workers in northwest Poland to accept a
settlement in a pay dispute that prompted a weeklong strike in May.
   The workers agreed May 28 to end a weeklong strike that shut
down Poland's Baltic ports after Walesa promised to help them
achieve their demands.
   In talks between the Solidarity labor union, the Labor Ministry
and the management of the state-owned railroads, the union won a
$19-a-month pay increase, a significant raise for the workers who
averaged about $79 per month. The workers had demanded a larger
increase but approved Walesa's arrangement Wednesday.
   In Warsaw, officials said the raise had been planned and did not
represent a retreat from the government's pledge not to increase
pay under pressure of strikes.
   ``One should not treat it as a government concession,'' said
Marek Dabrowski, deputy finance minister, at a news conference.
   Government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska added: ``It
should not arouse hope that one can demand salary increases by
means of strikes.''

   Could it be that the hated zebra mussel isn't
all bad?
   Soviet scientists apparently think so, says an Environmental
Protection Agency official who is planning to visit Moscow next
month in search of ideas for battling the tiny mollusks.
   Officials are frantically searching for a way to prevent
infestation of the Great Lakes by the pesky mussels, with their
zebra-like stripes.
   Valdas V. Adamkus, the EPA's national program manager for the
Great Lakes, said Wednesday he had received some papers from Soviet
scientists who earlier notified him they had developed a biological
method of attacking the pest.
   Zebra mussels breed rapidly and attach themselves to municipal
water intake pipes.
   Much to his surprise, however, the papers said nothing about
ways to eradicate the mussel, Adamkus said. Instead, they described
the creature as useful because it can help control water pollution.
   ``They proved through their scientific work that zebra mussels
can be a cleansing agent,'' he said. ``So instead of trying to
reduce them, they are actually trying to ... increase their
population.
   ``We were surprised,'' he said. ``We're trying to eliminate the
zebra mussels and they are actually using them as an agent for
purification of water.''
   How the mussels could clean dirty water isn't clear, Adamkus
said. But the report has made him all the more eager to visit the
Soviet Union.
   ``I'm going to call on all the available scientists over there,
meet with them, get any information or whatever scientific work or
literature is available,'' he said.
   Last summer, the mussels clogged the water intake pipe of
Monroe, Mich., restricting the flow through the 6,000-foot pipe by
nearly 24 percent.
   Zebra mussels originated in Eastern Europe's freshwater seas and
are believed to have entered the Great Lakes in the ballast water
of oceangoing vessels.
   They showed up in Lake St. Clair in 1987 and rapidly infested
Lake Erie. They have been spotted from Duluth, Minn., to New York.
   In a related development, the House Appropriations Committee
voted Wednesday to spend $1 million for zebra mussel research at
the Great Lakes Research Laboratory at Ann Arbor.
   Another $3 million for zebra mussel study was reserved, pending
completion of legislation to authorize the Sea Grant program, said
Rep. Bob Carr, D-Mich., a committee member.
   The panel also set aside $1.4 million to combat the sea lamprey,
another Great Lakes pest.

<HEAD>Former Northern Ireland Prime Minister Dead at 75</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Terence O'Neill, a former prime minister of
Northern Ireland who attempted to reconcile Protestants and Roman
Catholics in the 1960s, has died, the government said Wednesday. He
was 75.
   O'Neill, who served as the province's prime minister from
1963-69, died Tuesday at his home in Lymington, Hampshire.
   Britain suspended Northern Ireland's parliament in 1972 in the
the face of growing sectarian and political violence and instituted
direct rule in 1973.
   O'Neill was named a lord in 1970, and spoke frequently in
Britain's House of Lords on Northern Ireland.
   Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey said of O'Neill: ``He was a
good man who meant well and, perhaps, if he had succeeded in the
things he undertook, the whole course of events in Northern Ireland
might have been different.''
   Irish Deputy Prime Minister Brian Lenihan added: ``He will
always be remembered as the Terence O'Neill in the 1960s who, with
(Irish Prime Minister) Sean Lemass, initiated certain historic
attempts at reconciliation between all Irish people.''
   O'Neill was born on Sept. 10, 1914, into an aristocratic
Anglo-Irish family.
   He fought with the Irish Guards during World War II and in 1946,
entered Northern Ireland's parliament as a member of the
predominantly Protestant Unionist Party.
   He succeeded Lord Brookeborough as prime minister in 1963.
   Soon after taking office, he introduced reforms aimed at
accommodating the growing political aspirations of the Roman
Catholic minority. He also worked to strengthen trade with Ireland.
   In January 1965, after a surprise visit by Irish Prime Minister
Lemass to Parliament, angry Protestant extremists who opposed a
rapprochment with the predominantly Catholic Irish Republic began
an ``O'Neill Must Go'' campaign led by the Rev. Ian Paisley.
   In 1968, friction between Catholics and Protestants escalated
into violent riots in Northern Ireland, convincing O'Neill of the
need for reform.
   He faced opposition from his home secretary, William Craig, who
demanded strong police action against civil rights demonstrators.
   O'Neill fired Craig and instituted a number of reforms to aid
the Catholic community, including changes in local administration.
   Frustrated by critics who feared the loss of British
sovereignty, O'Neill called a general election in February 1969. He
managed to win leadership of his badly split party, but resigned
two months later.
   Jack Lynch, Irish prime minister from 1966-73, described O'Neill
as ``a man of courage and vision.''
   ``It's a great pity that he was unable to bring the majority of
his Cabinet along with him in his reforms. .... He clearly wanted
to see the people of all Ireland, north and south, live in peace,
friendship and economic well being,'' Lynch said.
   O'Neill is survived by a wife, the former Katherine Jean
Whitaker, and a son and daughter.

   Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria have
applied to belong to the World Bank and could become members of the
U.N. loan fund by the fall, its president said Wednesday.
   World Bank President Barber Conable said he expected the two
East bloc nations will ``doubtlessly be accepted by the time of the
annual meeting,'' which is scheduled for late September in
Washington.
   The World Bank, or International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, is a specialized agency of the United Nations set up
to further economic development through guaranteed loans and to
train member-state officials toward that end.
   World Bank officials meet annually with the International
Monetary Fund. The IMF director, Michel Camdessus, said last month
that he hoped Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia would become members of
his organization this fall.
   Each of the World Bank's 153 members also belong to the IMF.
   The IMF promotes monetary cooperation, currency stabilization
and trade expansion, and is charged with working out
balance-of-payment difficulties in the international community.
   Conable, who attended an annual meeting of the Federation of
West German Industries on Wednesday, met with West Germany's
Minister for Economic Cooperation, Juergen Warnke, on Tuesday.
   He said Warnke told him that West Germany's plans for
unification with East Germany haven't reduced the country's
commitments to international development.
   Conable said the World Bank intends to actively take part in
reconstruction of East European economies in support of democratic
changes taking place there.
   He said the bank has earmarked $2.5 billion for economic
development and environmental projects in Poland, and that an
additional $5 billion was being made available in loans to Eastern
Europe over the next three years.
   A representative office will be set up in Warsaw in July,
Conable said. ``We're going to have a big program in Poland,'' he
said.
   Also Wednesday, the World Bank and the Polish government reached
agreement on a key $300 million loan to assist economic reform, a
Polish finance ministry official said.
   The so-called ``structural adjustment loan'' provides not only
funds but represents World Bank approval for the shock reform
program undertaken by Poland's non-Communist government, Deputy
Finance Minister Marek Dabrowski said.
   Final World Bank approval is anticipated by the end of August,
Dabrowski.
   Conable also made general world debt problems a theme of his
remarks.
   He said he hoped that the seven major industrialized country,
the United States, Canada, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France and
Italy, will decide on new ways to deal with world debt at their
annual economic summit in Houston, Texas next month.
   ``No successful way of dealing with that has been found yet,''
the World Bank leader said.
   Another major issue at the Houston meeting includes funding to
curtail ``environmental degradation,'' in the world, Conable said.

<TEXT>
   Aides to President Carlos Menem
said Wednesday the Argentina leader is uncomfortable that his
marital strife has become a public scandal.
   Argentine newspapers gave more coverage Wednesday to Menem's
decision to bar his wife from the presidential residence than to
his shaky relations with the military; another devaluation of the
austral; and even Argentina's World Cup soccer match against the
Soviet Union. (Argentina won 2-0 Wednesday).
   ``Presidential Scandal,'' read the headline in Nuevo Sur.
``Marriage Crack!'' trumpeted Diario Popular. Pagina 12 changed its
name on the front page to Radiolandia 12, a reference to a popular
soap opera.
   Security guards refused to let Zulema Menem enter the 65-acre
presidential compound in suburban Olivos on Tuesday. She didn't
take that lightly.
   ``This is my home and that of my children,'' she told a crush of
reporters and photographers. ``They are throwing out all of us.''
   ``We're leaving because the president has thrown us out,'' son
Carlos, 21, agreed.
   They angrily drove off with Zulema Eva, the Menems' 19-year-old
daughter, to a private apartment Mrs. Menem maintains in the
fashionable Recoleta neighborhood of Buenos Aires.
   The differences between Menem, 59, and his 46-year-old wife have
been known for years _ they have lived apart for nearly half their
24-year marriage, each blaming the other for the long separations.
   ``Mrs. Menem wants to make a scandal and that is exactly what
the president and we want to avoid,'' a presidential adviser _ not
identified _ was quoted on Wednesday as telling the independent
news agency Diarios y Noticias.
   Menem himself told the government news agency Telam, ``I love my
family. I love my kids. But I'm not going to talk about a problem
that has to do with my private life.''
   Tuesday night, young Carlos appeared on a television talk show
and said, ``It hurts me to lose my father.'' He added, ``This is
even worse than a dictatorship. ... I'm going to fight it to the
end.''
   Mrs. Menem walked out of the presidential residence earlier this
year, but returned days later. Menem walked out on May 8, returning
_ alone _ for the first time Tuesday night.
   Mrs. Menem, whose family is wealthy, stood outside the
presidential compound and complained, ``They didn't even let me
take my things. I have only what I have on.''
   Later, she issued a statement cautioning her husband to make
sure her furniture and clothes are cared for.
   The children side with their mother and claim they also are
barred from the compound. Menem, the former governor of the poor
interior province of La Rioja, insists they can come and go as they
please.
   Neither spouse has publicly taken steps to obtain a legal
separation, or divorce _ which now is legal in this South American
nation where Roman Catholicism is the state religion.
   Separation or divorce may soon take place.
   Justice Secretary Cesar Arias said Mrs. Menem apparently has
consulted lawyers, and is ``reserving her rights in such a way it
could be understood she could apply for a divorce.''
   Menem became president last July.

   Demonstrators tore down barricades that
tied up traffic in downtown Sofia on Wednesday after an opposition
leader said it was not the right way to protest election results
favoring the former Communists.
   The leadership of the main opposition alliance _ the Union of
Democratic Forces _ issued a statement asking that public order be
maintained. It said such action as blocking main streets ``turns
the citizens against the UDF.''
   The 16-party UDF alliance trailed the governing Socialist Party,
formerly the Communist Party, in Sunday's first-round voting for
parliament _ Bulgaria's first free elections in 58 years.
   Final results were expected Thursday, election officials said.
   Traffic halted in much of Sofia on Wednesday because of the
barricades.
   UDF leader Zhelyu Zhelev appealed to protesters to unblock the
streets and disperse, saying, ``Your reaction is not adequate to
the situation. We ask you in the name of our political cause to
remove the barricades.''
   After about an hour the barricades came down and traffic resumed.
   Political analysts said it was still possible the opposition
could gain a slight edge after second-round voting next Sunday,
given the partial results from the first round and projections by
West German and Bulgarian vote experts.
   Leaders of the UDF and of other opposition groups agreed to back
each other's candidates in runoffs, to be held in 81 constituencies
where no candidate received mpore than 50 percent of the vote.
   In other protest developments:
   _Television employees complained that state TV failed to
accurately cover the elections and backed a student demand that the
director of TV, Pavel Pisarev, resign, the state BTA news agency
reported. Up to 300 people continued a protest near the TV station
pressing demands for Pisarev's resignation.
   _Sofia University students kept up a sit-in strike begun Tuesday
at the main university building, demanding publication of alleged
electoral abuses. Exams were suspended as faculty joined students
in demanding lifting of the ``news blackout,'' BTA said. It said
students in at least three other cities supported the strike, as
did the independent trade union Podkrepa.
   _Podkrepa asked its supporters to show their feelings about the
elections ``by peaceful civic means ... by rallies, demonstrations
and human chains.''
   Bulgarian state radio reported demonstations in Yambol, Ruse,
Veliko Tarnovo, Vratsa and Varna. BTA said about 30 people in
Yambol went on a 24-hour hunger strike Tuesday.
   Varna protesters held up a banner declaring the Black Sea port
``A Zone Free of Communism.''
   This was apparently a spinoff of the ``Communist Free Zone''
declared in University Square in Bucharest by anti-Communist
protesters, who blockaded the square for 53 days before police
roughly dispersed them early Wednesday.
   Half of Parliament's 400 seats are being filled by direct
election, the other 200 based on the percentage of votes each party
receives.
   The Socialists won 75 seats outright last Sunday, according to
final results released Wednesday by the Central Election Commission.
   UDF candidates won 32 seats and the mostly ethnic-Turkish
Movement for Rights and Freedoms won in nine, state radio reported.
One seat went to an independent and one each to two small
opposition parties.
   The Socialists apparently won easily in four of the 28 regional
districts, and the UDF won in a fifth as well as in Sofia.
   Sunday's runoffs will mostly pit the Socialist Party against the
UDF.
   The UDF favors more rapid reforms toward a Western-style market
economy; the Socialists are more cautious.
   Some of the current leaders of the Socialist Party _ renamed
from the Communist Party _ played a decisive role in ousting
hard-line Communist strongman Todor Zhivkov last November and
initiating reform.

   A kidnapped U.S. gold miner may not be
released because the $60,000 his family and community scraped
together for what it thought was his ransom is only one-tenth what
his captors are demanding.
   ``The last we know, the demand still stands at 350 million
pesos, which is about $612,000,'' Jeffrey Fino, general manager of
the IMINCO mining company in Ecuador that employed Scott Heimdal of
Peoria, Ill., said Wednesday.
   Fino has been closely involved in negotiations with the
Communist guerrillas who kidnapped the 27-year-old Heimdal in late
April and took him to neighboring Colombia. He said the family had
been under the impression if they paid $60,000, their son would be
freed.
   However, the $60,000 that Heimdal's working-class family
collected from community donations was money the guerrillas were
demanding simply ``to guarantee his life,'' Fino said.
   The guerrillas have demanded the higher figure all along, said
Fino, who added it was not clear how the family came to
misunderstand the demand.
   The captive's father, Roy Heimdal, said Fino had not told him
the guerrillas were demanding the higher amount, though they talked
repeatedly.
   ``My understanding is the demand was brought down to $60,000,''
said Roy Heimdal. ``They said, `We want $60,000, or we will show
you where the body is.''
   He said he interpreted the threat to mean $60,000 would win
freedom for their son.
   In comments Wednesday from Peoria, he also said there had been
confusion throughout the negotiations and problems in translation.
   ``This is a complete surprise to me. It's just like a see-saw
that keeps going up and down,'' Roy Heimdal said.
   His wife, Marge, said they could raise no more money for the
guerrillas. ``We sold everything we had and had to get help from
strangers to raise $60,000. We don't have anymore. I'm on the verge
of losing my sanity.''
   Fino, 39, said a meeting with rebels Monday where part of the
$60,000 was delivered ended in failure.
   ``Their leader was not there. There were about eight guerrillas.
There was no negotiator. They were yelling and screaming at our
intermediary. Reaching an agreement is very difficult and dangerous
under these circumstances.''
   The guerrillas were upset because the go-between tried to
deliver the payment in dollars instead of Colombian currency, even
though they originally demanded dollars, Fino said.
   ``To make clear how irrational and unlogical these guys are,
they told our intermediary to take the dollars from the middle of
the jungle and be back within three hours with Colombian pesos or
they were going to kill Scott.
   ``He had to get back in a canoe, go back to the little river
port he had left from, grab a taxi and go into the main town of
Lago Agrio. He cleaned out the town of pesos,'' Fino said.
   But there was not enough Colombian currency in Lago Agrio, a
tiny Ecuadoran oil town 25 miles southwest of the rendezvous site,
to make the full payment.
   The guerrillas set a date later this month for the balance of
the payment. Fino would not reveal the date.
   ``At that time, we will demand Scott's release for that amount
of money,'' he said. ``They need to understand that's all the money
they're going to get.''
   Heimdal had been working with IMINCO helping dredge river beds
for gold deposits in the Ecuadoran jungle when he was abducted.
   Armed men wearing camouflage uniforms attacked a canoe Heimdal
was aboard. The boat was traveling the Bermeja River in thick
jungle about five miles from the Colombian border and 100 miles
northeast of Quito.
   The boat's driver was killed in the attack. The attackers, who
identified themselves as members of the People's Liberation Army, a
Colombian guerrilla group, freed an Ecuadoran geology student also
in the boat and sent him to Quito with the ransom demand.
   Fino described the latest contacts with the kidnappers in an
interview in his one-room office in Quito, 9,300 feet high in the
Andes.
   Spread across his desk were photos taken by the guerrillas at a
camp inside Colombia. The photos showed Heimdal sitting in a
hammock or beside a campfire beneath the jungle canopy.
   Close by were guerrillas pointing machine guns at him.
   He said in their first meeting the guerrillas demanded $1.5
million in ransom, ``then came down to $1.2 million in two
minutes.''
   ``We have been trying to convince them that they've got the
wrong person,'' Fino said. ``The company is not wealthy. We have
been running up a debt, not a profit. The family is not rich.
   ``They still believe there is money. If we could convince them
that this $60,000 is all there is, we feel they would understand
that and release Scott.''
   Heimdal's friends in Peoria describe him as an adventurer. They
say he saved up money from a job as a computer technician in Boston
to go to South America.
   Heimdal, with IMINCO since October, operated electronic
equipment that located gold deposits on the river bottom. He also
was overseeing construction of a large dredge.
   Fino said he has received reports Heimdal was suffering from a
problem with his feet and he thinks it most likely is an infection
from flea bites.
   He sent in antibiotics and says the guerrillas promised to
provide medical treatment for Heimdal.
   Fino says he remains distrustful of the kidnappers.
   ``One part of me is extremely optimistic,'' he said. ``But
another part of me is extremely scared because these people are
irrational. They're unpredictable. That makes them very dangerous.''

<TEXT>
   The United States will stop its efforts to set
up Mideast peace talks unless Israel agrees to proceed without
delay, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Wednesday.
   ``The phone number (for the White House switchboard) is
202-456-1414. When you're serious about this, call us,'' Baker said
in comments directed to the Israeli government.
   Baker, testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
urged the new government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to accept
the U.S. plan for talks with Palestinians. Those talks could lead
to elections among the 1.7 million Palestinians in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   If the new government, which includes some of Israel's most
hawkish politicians, puts unacceptable conditions for Palestinian
participation in the talks, ``there won't be any dialogue, there
won't be any peace,'' Baker said.
   The United States cannot get the talks going unless Israel shows
willingness, he said.
   Meanwhile, Shamir and Foreign Minister David Levy said they
wanted American guarantees that Israel would not have to speak to
the Palestine Liberation Organization or discuss any Palestinian
state in U.S.-proposed peace talks.
   ``Deal with us as allies. ... First we have to reach an
agreement on these things, and then other things can certainly be
achieved,'' Levy said at a ceremony in Jerusalem formally
installing him as foreign minister.
   Baker's comments are expected to exacerbate tensions with the
Israeli government, which already has embarked on a collision
course with Washington by pledging to spend more on Jewish
settlements in the occupied lands and by refusing to promise to
refrain from settling Soviet Jews there.
   That issue will be raised in the next few weeks when the United
States begins discussions with Israel about implementing a bill
granting the Israelis $400 million in housing guarantees for the
influx of Soviet Jews.
   Baker said he didn't know what assurances the administration
would seek, except for the standard pledge to use U.S. money only
in the lands it held before the 1967 Mideast war.
   The United States does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over
land seized during the war.
   Shamir, in an interview published Wednesday in the
English-language Jerusalem Post, denied his government would build
new settlements in the occupied lands.
   ``The emphasis will be on the ... strengthening of the now
existing settlements,'' Shamir said.
   Baker's public lecture was met with dismay by the Israeli
Embassy and the powerful Jewish lobby.
   An embassy statement said the new government was willing and
eager to promote the peace process, which it said was ``best served
by direct communications between the U.S. administration and the
new Israeli government.''
   Seymour Reich, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major
Jewish Organizations, said Baker's remarks were both surprising and
disturbing.
   ``The (Bush) administration has shown patience _ perhaps
excessive patience _ with the PLO's refusal to condemn the
attempted terrorist raid against the Tel Aviv beaches and to
discipline Abu Abbas, who claimed credit for it. Similar patience
with the new government in Jerusalem might have been a wiser course
than conducting diplomacy in public, as Mr. Baker did today,''
Reich said in a statement.
   In February, Baker said, it appeared that 11 months of U.S.
mediation were about to bear fruit with a historic
Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.
   But Israel's coalition government refused to take the final step
of accepting the formula for composition of the Palestinian
delegation, leading to the March 15 collapse of the government.
   Baker told the committee that he had asked Israel to accept a
list of Palestinian delegates made up of residents from the
occupied territories, as well as some who had been deported from
the territories and Palestinians with addresses both in East
Jerusalem and the territories.
   The complicated formula was designed to appease Israel and the
PLO, with which Israel refuses to negotiate.
   ``It's very hard for us to understand ... why we didn't get a
`yes' answer,'' Baker said.
   However, he said the administration was willing to ``let bygones
be bygones.''
   ``The challenge for all sides is to try to put (the peace
process) back on track ... and to see if we can't create a better
environment for peacemaking,'' Baker said.
   For Palestinians, he said, it means ``looking beyond the tragic
human losses that they have suffered and recommitting themselves to
the political process.''
   At least 717 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians, and 45 Israelis have died in an uprising in the
territories that began in December 1987.

   Military leaders said Wednesday they
should not be held responsible for atrocities following a 1973
coup, but the country's Roman Catholic bishops urged the courts to
determine guilt.
   The clash over past human rights abuses intensified last week
with the discovery of at least 20 well-preserved bodies in a mass
grave in the northern fishing town of Pisagua, used as a detention
camp for anti-government leftists in late 1973 and early 1974.
   An Interior Ministry subsecretary, Belisario Velasco, said
Wednesday that of the 20 bodies, 17 had bullet wounds, two were
mutilated and one was beheaded. He said 15 bodies have been
identified and their remains will be handed over to relatives.
   Former military ruler Augusto Pinochet led the Sept. 11, 1973,
coup that ousted an elected leftist government during a period of
political and economic upheaval. His 16-year authoritarian rule was
stained by charges of widespread rights abuses.
   Pinochet handed over the presidency to an elected successor in
March, but retains command of the 60,000-member military.
   Pinochet sat in the front row, his face grim and brow lowered,
when an army declaration was read at a gathering of the generals'
corps Wednesday.
   ``Looking at things from the perspective of the peace we now
enjoy, it may appear that the military reaction was exaggerated,''
it said. ``But this overlooks the fact that Sept. 11, 1973, was a
military operation, that is a war action.''
   It said Chile was being torn apart by ``an internal war,
provoked by foreign ideologies.''
   ``War is never bloodless, and always brings pains, hates,
injustices and inhumanities,'' the army statement continued. ``Thus
we demand respect for our institution and for those who carried out
in our ranks the tough chores of war.''
   While in power, Pinochet decreed an amnesty for all rights abuse
that occurred before March 1978.
   A statement issued by Chile's bishops, released at almost the
same hour as the army's, said that trying to elude responsibility
for atrocities attempted to ``justify the unjustifible.''
   ``It will be the job of the justice system to clear up events
and determine guilt,'' the bishops said. ``The country needs to
know what happened.''
   They also said anyone with information on the whereabouts of
missing victims should step forward. At least 700 people
disappeared during the wave of political repression that followed
the coup, according to rights groups.
   President Patricio Aylwin has created a special commission to
investigate and report on the rights violations that occurred
during Pinochet's rule. The army has expressed fears of a political
witch hunt.

   President Bush said Wednesday he would oppose
legislation providing federal payment for workers who lose their
jobs in the Northwest because of efforts to protect the rare
northern spotted owl.
   But leaders of the Northwest's timber industry came away from a
meeting with Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. optimistic that
plans are in the works to minimize the economic hardship on the
region if the owl is listed next week as a threatened species.
   Bush said during a White House news conference he is ``very much
concerned about the potential loss of jobs as a result of this
spotted owl problem.''
   The president said, however, his administration opposed a Senate
amendment that would have compensated workers displaced by the
Clean Air Act and would follow the same logic in the case of the
owl.
   ``I opposed that and I would oppose a similar amendment,'' Bush
said.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is expected to declare the
owl as a threatened species by June 23. One panel of government
scientists has estimated that timber harvests on federal lands in
the Northwest will have to be cut nearly in half to save the owl
from extinction, a move the government projects would cost more
than 28,000 jobs by the end of the decade.
   ``I want those 30,000 families to understand that we care very
much about that, but I cannot say that I would support the very
kind of amendment that I opposed,'' Bush told reporters.
   ``But I hope that we can have a resolution of this problem that
will not result in throwing 30,000 families out of work,'' he said.
   Rep. Denny Smith, R-Ore., and a delegation of Oregonians
representing the timber industry are scheduled to meet at the White
House on Thursday to discuss the issue with Chief of Staff John
Sununu and other presidential advisers.
   Sununu said Wednesday he is hopeful the Fish and Wildlife
Service will issue a listing decision that ``doesn't gut the
economic vitality of that region.''
   The Oregon delegation met on Wednesday with Lujan, Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter and Forest Service Chief F. Dale
Robertson.

   The State Department said Wednesday it
deplored the use of excessive force by police in clearing
anti-government demonstrators from a square in the capital of
Romania.
   The department urged all sides to exercise restraint.
   ``We deplore the use of excessive force by the authorities in
clearing the square,'' said a department statement late in the day.
   ``We are concerned that this action by the Romanian authorities
may set off a cycle of violence. President Iliescu and his
government must now exercise restraint. We urge all Romanian
citizens to avoid violence and use peaceful means to express their
grievances.''

   The Bush administration will ask congressional
negotiators at high-level budget talks to give special treatment to
NASA, one of the president's chief domestic priorities, officials
said Wednesday.
   The officials, who spoke on condition they not be identified,
said the White House would propose that negotiators work out a
specific spending figure for next year's NASA budget.
   In budget summits of past years, administration and
congressional officials have agreed to a single spending amount
covering thousands of domestic programs, including NASA. The
budgets for individual agencies were then determined by Congress
during the regular legislative process.
   President Bush would thus greatly enhance his role in
determining NASA's budget if it is negotiated directly between
White House and congressional negotiators.
   That would be important to Bush and NASA because Congress does
not want to increase the space agency's budget by as much as the
president would like.
   The administration's proposal to consider NASA separately would
also leave the thousands of remaining domestic programs vulnerable
to cuts that may be agreed to by budget bargainers. Negotiators,
meeting Wednesday for a seventh time, are looking for ways to
shrink next year's federal deficit by $45 billion to $60 billion.
   Many lawmakers would be likely to reject Bush's proposal to
negotiate separately over NASA, said aides who asked to not be
identified.
   They said Bush's idea would provide protection to his pet
project while leaving their favorite programs exposed to potential
spending cuts.
   In his budget for fiscal 1991, Bush proposed giving NASA $15.2
billion, a 24 percent increase over this year's $12.3 billion. That
was the largest increase Bush requested for any of the government's
major agencies.
   ``The exploration of space has benefits for the United States
that go far beyond the quantifiable,'' Bush said in his budget,
which he presented in January.
   Congress has so far been less generous with the space agency.
   NASA would receive $14 billion next year under a fiscal 1991
budget approved in May by the House. A separate spending plan
approved by the Senate Budget Committee last month would give the
agency $14.2 billion.
   Both congressional budgets were written by majority Democrats.
   Asked to confirm the administration's intentions, one official
who spoke on condition of anonymity said, ``You can say
administration sources wouldn't deny it.''

   Showers and thunderstorms fell across the central United States
from eastern Kansas to northern Lake Michigan on Wednesday,
including a storm that downed power lines in an Illinois city.
Summer snow fell in Oregon.
   In the northern Illinois city of Belvidere, winds hitting 69 mph
downed electrical lines and started a fire at a downtown building.
   Up to 6 inches of snow fell overnight in some higher elevations
of Oregon.
   A few showers and thunderstorms developed along the central and
western Gulf Coast. Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the
nation, with clear skies across the southwestern quarter.
   A storm system developing along the California coast generated
strong, gusty winds in sections of Arizona and Southern California.
   Temperatures dropped into the 40s in New England and the
northern Plains. Readings were in the 30s and 40s in the Great
Basin of Nevada and the northern and central Rockies.
   It was an unseasonably cool 44 degrees at Atlantic City's
airport, tying the record for the date set in 1980.
   The low temperature for the Lower 48 was 30 degrees in McCall
and Malad City, Idaho.

<TEXT>
   About 120 prospective jurors in the trial of
three teen-agers accused of raping and nearly killing a Central
Park jogger were given questionnaires Wednesday asking their
attitudes on race and crime.
   All three defendants are black teen-agers who live in Harlem.
The victim is a 29-year-old white investment banker.
   The 54-question, 17-page form was handed to those from a pool of
382 who told state Supreme Court Justice Thomas Galligan they would
be able to stay for a six- to eight-week trial.
   The questionnaire asks if the prospective juror or his or her
children attended an integrated school; whether the person has
lived in a racially mixed community, and whether he or she has
friends of a different race.
   It also asks whether the individual would prefer help from a
police officer of his or her own racial or ethnic group if in need
of assistance.
   The questions were agreed on by all parties in the case, said
Michael Joseph, attorney for defendant Antron McCray, 15.
   Members of the Guardian Angels community patrol group marched in
front of the Manhattan courthouse, passing out leaflets that said
the case ``is not a question of black and white; it's about what's
wrong and what's right.''
   McCray and five other youths are charged with gang raping and
beating the woman as she jogged through the Central Park the
evening of April 19, 1989.
   The victim suffered brain damage in the assault and cannot
remember the attack or identify her assailants. After emerging from
a coma and being treated at a Connecticut rehabilitation hospital,
she returned to work at Salomon Brothers and recently was named a
vice president.
   McCray, along with Yusef Salaam and Raymond Santana, both 16,
are being tried as adults on charges of attempted murder, rape,
sodomy, sexual abuse, assault, robbery and riot. The other three
youths are to be tried later, also as adults.
   If any in the first group were to be convicted, they would be
sentenced as juveniles and would face a maximum of 10 years in
prison.
   The questionnaire also asks potential jurors if they have a
particular bias against people accused of sex crimes, whether they
or any of their relatives jog, and whether they use Central Park
often.
   In addition, there are the usual questions about whether the
prospective juror has relatives in law enforcement or has been a
crime victim.
   Jury selection was to continue Thursday.

<HEAD>Disposable Diapers Not A Major Environmental Threat, P&amp;G Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY KINNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders in the disposable diaper industry said
Wednesday that cloth competitors and consumer misunderstandings
likely accounted for recent survey results indicating strong
support for banning their product.
   ``It's not a simple issue of environment vs. paper diapers,''
said Scott Stewart, a spokesman for Procter &amp; Gamble Co.
   The roughly 16 billion disposable diapers sold every year have
become an environmental and health issue as local governments try
to deal with mountains of used, bacteria-laden dirty diapers and
rapidly filling landfills.
   Bans or taxes on disposable diapers are being considered in at
least 20 states. Nebraska, for example, has generally banned the
sale of new nondegradable diapers effective Oct. 1, 1993.
   A national Media General-Associated Press poll on environmental
concerns found that 71 percent of respondents supported a ban on
disposable diapers.
   In a recent Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll, respondents
favored a ban on disposable diapers by a 3-1 ratio. In a Gallup
Organization poll, 43 percent of respondents supported a ban, and
38 percent favored a tax.
   But Stewart said the criticism is misleading. He said disposable
diapers account for only about 1 percent of trash in the nation's
landfills.
   Furthermore, he said, cloth diapers were not necessarily
environmentally safer because they take more energy to make and
need water for cleaning.
   ``We don't get rattled about surveys because they don't tell us
anything we don't already know,'' Stewart said. ``Our competition _
the cloth diaper industry _ has been relatively successful in
painting this as an environmental problem.
   ``There's no dispute that disposables contribute to solid waste,
but it's a relatively small part, and it's unfair to say it is a
major contributor.''
   Procter &amp; Gamble says its Pampers and Luvs have about half of
the nation's $3.5 billion-a-year disposable diaper business. The
other major manufacturer is Dallas-based Kimberly-Clark Corp.,
which makes Huggies.
   Kimberly-Clark spokeswoman Jean Allen said it was unfair to
blame disposable diapers for all landfill problems. She said
consumers who used disposables simply weighed convenience against
environmental costs.
   ``If you were to ban disposable diapers and use cloth, you would
not come up with no environmental cost,'' she said. ``An individual
has to balance that cost. Water is a limited resource; there are
chemical and detergent wastes to be considered, and air pollution.
   ``This way the consumer has the right to weigh what they
consider the best alternative against the environmental cost.''
   Jack Mogavero, president of General Health Care Corp. of
Piscataway, N.J., said his company delivers nearly 2.9 million
cloth diapers a week in 14 states.
   ``I don't know anything about any poll, but I know what the
consensus of the people is, based on the number of customers we
serve weekly,'' Mogavero said by telephone. ``We've experienced
tremendous growth, and I have to attribute that to the ecology
issue.''
   Mogavero said his company processes cloth diapers for softening
and to inhibit bacteria growth.
   ``That, along with home delivery and the ecology issue, is
turning the business around,'' he said. ``I think the public is
extremely concerned with the ecology issue, not just diapers.''
   The National Association of Diaper Services estimated in October
that 750,000 households used cloth diaper services, a 38.5 percent
increase in a year.
   Some hospitals are switching to cloth after years of using
disposables.
   ``While well-intentioned, the perception that has driven that
decision is that disposables are an environmental hazard, and they
are not,'' Stewart said. Some small companies have developed
disposables they say are degradable, but neither of the big
producers have such plans. Both said actual disposal conditions
tended to limit any breakdown of a ``degradable'' diaper over time.
   ``At this time, we don't see the so-called biodegradable diaper
as a real solution,'' Ms. Allen said. ``Nothing degrades in a
landfill; to say a diaper degrades in a landfill is a marketing
claim. You can dig up a newspaper 25 years later and read it.''

<TEXT>
   Liberian government and rebel
delegations met for six hours Wednesday and agreed to an appeal
from Liberia's religious leaders to end attacks on civilians.
   A joint statement signed by both sides made no reference to
church leaders' request for an immediate cease-fire in the
5{-month-old civil war. But it said an end to attacks on
non-combatants ``will go a long way in enhancing the peace process
now successfully under way.''
   More than 1,000 people have been killed, many of them civilians,
since the rebel National Patriotic Front moved into Liberia from
the Ivory Coast on Dec. 24 and began a drive on Monrovia, the
Liberian capital.
   Wednesday was the second day of talks mediated by the Liberian
Council of Churches at a U.S. Embassy auditorium in the Sierra
Leone capital. Talks will resume Thursday.
   Both sides signed the statement, which called for ``an immediate
end to the killings, molestation and destruction of properties and
innocent civilians and other non-combatants.''
   It said the government and insurgents strongly condemned ``the
killing, harassment and destruction of properties of unarmed
civilians as such acts will not benefit any side, since there can
be no winners in this fracticidal war.''
   The statement also said negotiators approved an agenda for
``substantive talks leading to the peaceful resolution of the
confict.''
   No mention was made of the demand by rebel leader Charles Taylor
that President Samuel Doe resign and leave Liberia before
negotiations could proceed.
   The insurgents have charged Doe's government with human rights
abuse, economic bungling and corruption in the 10 years since Doe
seized power in a violent coup.
   Most fighting in Liberia appeared to have stopped Wednesday, a
week after government troops retook a rubber plantation outside the
capital from the rebels.
   But hundreds of Americo-Liberians fled their suburban homes
Wednesday for Monrovia. They said soldiers accused them of being
dissidents and supporting Taylor.
   Taylor and thousands of Liberia's 2.5 million people are the
descendants of freed American slaves who founded the West African
nation in 1847. They oppose Doe, whose coup ousted other
Americo-Liberians.
   Diplomats said the fleeing Liberians are trying to leave the
country by road or air for Ivory Coast, Guinea and Sierra Leone.
   ``They just want to get out and are worrying about getting to
the United States later,'' said one Western diplomat, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   A military trial began in Monrovia on Wednesday of three
soldiers charged with killing four civilians. Although hundreds of
civilians are believed to have been killed by soldiers since the
insurgency began, it was the first known prosecution.
   A major and two lieutenants were accused of leading an attack
Saturday on the Americo-Liberian settlement of Clay Ashland and
killing the town's mayor and three others.
   Liberia's diplomatic corps on Wednesday condemned ethnic
killings by both government troops and rebels.
   ``The diplomatic corps is dismayed that murders of innocent
civilians are continuing to occur daily because they belong to
certain ethnic groups _ Mano, Gio, Mandingo, Krahn,
Americo-Liberians,'' the statement said.
   Human rights organizations accuse soldiers of killing Gios and
Manos. Many rebels are of those ethnic backgrounds. Rebels
retaliated by killing Krahns _ Doe is a Krahn _ and Mandingos,
accused of supporting Doe.
   More than 1,000 Americans, mostly Liberians carrying U.S.
passports, and hundreds of other European, Asian and Lebanese
nationals remain in Monrovia.
   British and U.S. warships are stationed off Liberia, prepared to
carry out a sea evacuation if necessary.

<HEAD>State Prosecutors to Appeal Dismissal of Helmsley Counts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state prosecutor said Wednesday his office
will appeal the dismissal of 180 counts of a 188-count tax fraud
indictment filed against self-styled hotel queen Leona Helmsley.
   Assistant Attorney General Alfredo Mendez said the appeal will
be filed Thursday with the state Supreme Court's Appellate
Division. Mendez also filed a cross-motion seeking reinstatement of
27 charges.
   Justice John A.K. Bradley said last month he was dismissing the
180 charges on double-jeopardy grounds because they were
essentially the same as those on which Mrs. Helmsley was convicted
in federal court last year.
   Mrs. Helmsley, 70, is appealing the federal conviction and
sentence of four years in prison and a $7.1 million fine.
   A state indictment charges her and her billionaire real-estate
developer husband Harry with tax and business fraud. Most counts
alleged they charged personal expenses from their Connecticut
estate to their businesses.
   Harry Helmsley was found unfit to stand trial in the federal
case. State charges against him remain since double jeopardy
doesn't apply.
   One of Mrs. Helmsley's attorneys, Sandor Frankel, asked Bradley
to order Mendez to give the defense a ``bill of particulars,''
specifying what she is accused of doing, for the remaining eight
counts.
   Bradley said he will rule June 20 on the various applications,
including a defense petition to dismiss four of the remaining
counts, and will decide whether to hold a hearing on Harry
Helmsley's fitness to stand trial.

<TEXT>
   The defense called only three witnesses and
rested its case Wednesday before the sudden death of a bailiff
injected turmoil into the murder trial of a college student accused
of strangling her romantic rival.
   Circuit Judge Michael Hoover broke into tears and defense lawyer
Stephen Glynn openly sobbed as they and District Attorney Greg Grau
met for an hour to determine what the jury should be told about
bailiff Norman Block's death.
   Block died at his home Wednesday morning, apparently of a heart
attack, Clerk of Courts Donna Seidel said. The friendly bailiff had
been attending to the jury, which was sequestered at a motel.
   Hoover decided he would tell jurors about the death only if they
inquired about Block's absence. At that point, he said, he would
individually interview jurors to determine their ability to devote
full attention to the trial.
   Closing arguments were scheduled for Thursday in the trial of
Lori Esker, 20, of Hatley.
   She was Marathon County's Dairy Princess _ winner of a talent
and leadership contest in agriculture _ until she resigned in
October when she was charged with murder in the Sept. 20
strangulation of Lisa Cihaski, 21, of Birnamwood. The charge
carries a mandatory life sentence on conviction.
   The prosecution contends Ms. Esker believed Ms. Cihaski had
stolen away her boyfriend, Eland dairy farmer Bill Buss. In a fit
of jealousy, prosecutors contended, she rented a car, drove 150
miles from the University of Wisconsin-River Falls, where she was a
student, and strangled Ms. Cihaski with the woman's belt.
   The defense did not call Ms. Esker to testify. A statement she
gave police admitting she strangled Ms. Cihaski in self-defense
during an argument over Buss was adequate to tell the jury her
version, Glynn said.

   Soldiers shot demonstrators outside
the Interior Ministry on Wednesday night after anti-government
protesters stormed state TV offices and burned police headquarters,
witnesses said.
   State radio reported four people killed and 93 hospitalized,
four in a very ``grave state.'' Two of those killed were shot to
death, the broadcast added, quoting the Health Ministry.
   The Soviet news agency Tass, in a dispatch from Bucharest, said
``many cars'' near the Interior Ministry and police headquarters
were overturned and set ablaze and two buildings nearby were also
on fire.
   The violence was the worst since the December revolution that
ousted Communist dictator Nicolai Ceausescu, who was executed with
his wife on Christmas Day.
   The Interior Ministry now occupies the building that was
formerly the headquarters of Ceausescu's despised secret police.
   President-elect Ion Iliescu accused extremist elements of
organizing an ``Iron Guard rebellion'' and trying to overthrow the
government _ a reference to the pre-World War II Iron Guard party
that supported the Nazis.
   The violence was touched off by a pre-dawn police raid that
ended a 53-day anti-communist protest in University Square in
downtown Bucharest. Police clubbed and dragged away protesters.
   The protesters were demanding that former high-ranking
Communists like Iliescu be banned from holding public office for 10
years and that independent television stations be established.
   In Washington, the State Department said it deplored the use
``of excessive force by the authorities in clearing the square.
   ``We are concerned that this action by the Romanian authorities
may set off a cycle of violence. President Iliescu and his
government must now exercise restraint,'' the statement said.
   One witness said she helped carry 12 bodies from outside the
Interior Ministry and another reported seeing at least two bodies
but these reports could not be confirmed officially.
   Demonstrators halted broadcasts for about 45 minutes at state
TV, scene of fierce fighting and dramatic on-air appeals for an end
to Communist rule last December.
   The state news agency Rompres reported ``seriously wounded''
near the Interior Ministry, police headquarters and the TV station.
   Thousands of pro-government supporters thronged to government
headquarters at Victory Square late Wednesday in response to
Iliescu's appeal for ``responsible people'' to protect government
buildings. Rompres said 5,000 miners and thousands of other
government supporters were bound for Bucharest.
   An opposition leader, Liberal Party chief Sen. Radu Campeanu,
said such action would only aggravate the situation.
   The rampage came weeks after Romania's first free elections in
44 years on May 20 _ tainted by allegations of campaign and
electoral irregularities.
   The demonstrators say Communists still dominate the National
Salvation Front, in power since December and the overwhelming
winners of last month's elections.
   Demonstrators fought police in the afternoon in University
Square, then fanned out to police headquarters, the Interior
Ministry, the TV station and Victory Square.
   ``We are now facing an organized, planned attempt to overthrow
through force and violence the leadership elected in a free and
democratic way,'' Iliescu said in a communique Wednesday night.
   Iliescu, the first ex-Communist to win a popular presidential
election in Eastern Europe, pleaded for support for the army and
security forces ``to liquidate this Iron Guard rebellion and
reinstate calm.''
   A government communique said demonstrators stole weapons,
ammunition and police uniforms from the Interior Ministry. It said
a filling station near the ministry was attacked and gasoline
stolen to make firebombs.
   Rebecca Doina Cercel said she and others helped carry 12 bodies
to ambulances outside the ministry. She said the bodies were taken
to the morgue.
   Mrs. Cercel's 4-year-old son was killed in December's
revolution. She had been in University Square since the protest
began in April.
   Mrs. Cercel, 25, told The Associated Press police clubbed her.
She had bruises on her face and abdomen.
   Scottish freelance photographer Jeremy Sutton-Hibbert said he
saw soldiers shooting from inside the ministry and the body of a
man shot in the head.
   AP reporter Gabriel Paslaru said demonstrators who tried to
force the main gate of the building were met with rifle fire or
single shots.
   ``I saw one man with an injured hand who fainted before he was
rushed into a car and another man who was hit in the neck. His face
was a red mask of blood _ it is hard to believe he could survive,''
Paslaru said.
   Police said earlier about 260 people were detained.
   State television was stormed by protesters who occupied one of
the main studios. An announcer said they might not be able to
transmit any longer.
   Minutes later, the picture was cut and then the sound but the
station went back on the air three-quarters of an hour later.
   ``A bunch of people who were drunk got into the TV and it is a
grave situation which we hope will never again occur,'' said the
television's director, Razvan Teodorescu.
   Earlier, demonstrators carrying gasoline cans, some armed with
clubs, stormed the regular police headquarters in central
Bucharest, then set fire to nearby cars and trucks and a wing of
the building.
   Fire trucks arrived to fight the blaze.
   About 1,500 people gathered outside and booed when helicopters
flew overhead. Some protesters marched toward Victory Square,
headquarters of the National Salvation Front.
   The violence began before dawn, when police sealed off the
central square with trucks and buses, then moved in on the sleeping
demonstrators with clubs.
   Police ripped down the tent camp the protesters had built. Some
protesters had been on hunger strikes.
   By midafternoon, steel-helmeted police were battling about 1,000
protesters who overturned a police van and freed two prisoners,
then set the van ablaze, witnesses said.
   Fleeing demonstrators smashed glass doors to get inside nearby
Intercontinental Hotel but were dragged away by police. Protesters
hurled rocks at police, who hurled the stones back.

<HEAD>Navy Confiscates Video from `Inside Edition' Crew</HEAD>

   Military police confiscated video from an
``Inside Edition'' television crew taping penned dolphins at a base
where the mammals are trained as guards for nuclear submarines, the
Navy said Wednesday.
   Reporter Craig Rivera, brother of talk-show host Geraldo Rivera,
two other crew members and Richard O'Barry, best known as a trainer
for the ``Flipper'' television series, were detained briefly
Tuesday for allegedly crossing into a restricted zone at Key West
Naval Station.
   ``They were warned off and in fact crossed the lines anyway,''
Ensign Robin Perkins said. ``They were apprehended because they
were in a restricted naval area.''
   No charges were filed, but she said a report on the incident
will be referred to the U.S. attorney's office for review.
   ``They weren't booked on any kind of charges. The films were
confiscated and they were escorted off base,'' Perkins said.
   The crew for the nationally syndicated tabloid television show
and O'Barry were in a chartered boat ``about 150 yards away from
the pens.
   ``There were no signs saying off-limits,'' O'Barry said. ``We
were told to get out of there and then ordered to hand over the
film. We were surrounded by 15 Navy frogmen.''
   He said the same thing happened last week to a crew for ABC's
``20@20'' newsmagazine show.
   ``We stand behind our investigative reporter Craig Rivera, as he
was within the parameters of the law and certainly within the
parameters of journalistic ethics,'' said program publicist Marcy
Baron in New York. She would not say whether efforts were being
made to recover the tape.
   O'Barry has been arrested twice this year in protests at a
Florida Keys resort where two recently captured dolphins were being
held for a marine park.
   A pair of Navy-trained dolphins are in pens at the Navy base as
part of a ``swimmer nullification program'' training the marine
mammals in Key West, San Diego and Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii.
   The dolphins reportedly are fitted with nose guns and taught to
kill enemy frogmen to protect submarines armed with Trident nuclear
missiles.
   The Navy has used dolphins, sea lions and beluga whales in
classified programs since the 1960s.
   The program was criticized in 1988 after several trainers
charged the animals suffered physical abuse and that the program
suffered from mismanagement, rapid employee turnover and pressure
to expand.

<TEXT>
   In life and death, thousands of pounds
of Atlantic herring have been eating up the oxygen in Block
Island's Old Harbor _ and stinking up the local lobster industry.
   Local officials Wednesday sought state help for lobstermen who
lost an undetermined amount of catch when the herring depleted the
small harbor's oxygen supply. About 10-15 commercial lobstermen
operate from the harbor.
   Restaurants on the tourism-dependent island also lost lobsters
stored in tanks that circulate harbor water.
   Andrew Hunt, an aide to Lt. Gov. Roger Begin, said he was trying
to arrange relief funds or low-interest loans for those affected.
   Experts believe a large school of small fish entered the
harbor's inner basin, on the island's east side, on June 4.
   ``What we think happened is a school of Atlantic herring
possibly was chased into the basin in the Old Harbor area by
predators. It could be bluefish or striped bass,'' said Joseph
Migliore, a scientist with the state Department of Environmental
Management.
   The small fish has a fast metabolism and consumes a lot of
oxygen. The school, estimated to weigh 15,000 to 50,000 pounds,
apparently overwhelmed the seven-acre basin and its oxygen supply.
   Such fish kills are relatively common in enclosed bodies of
water. But Block Islanders can't remember such a large kill on
their isolated dot 12 miles off the Rhode Island coast.
   ``As far as I know, and I've talked to people who've been
fishing out of that harbor all their lives, 15 to 30 years, this
has never happened,'' said Chris Littlefield, harbor master for New
Shoreham, the island's only town.
   First Warden Edward McGovern, New Shoreham's equivalent of a
mayor, said the smell got really bad last week, but is improving.
   As the fish began dying, lobstermen collected about 50 barrels
for bait. But most of the dead fish sank to the bottom and began to
rot _ further depleting the oxygen.
   Unsuspecting lobstermen left their catch in cages filled with
harbor water _for storage until shipment to market _ and some think
the lobsters suffocated.
   Lobsters in restaurant tanks suffered similar fates. At least
some eateries were seeking an alternative storing method until the
harbor oxygen is restored.
   Experts could not estimate the extent of the damage or predict
when the harbor would return to normal.
   Littlefield said some of the dead fish were beginning to be
swept out with the tide, but most were staying on the bottom.

<HEAD>Italy Passes New Law Making Drug Use a Crime</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament has made drug use a crime in Italy in an
effort to stem an increasing number of overdose deaths and
narcotics-related crimes. Opponents said the new law infringes on
personal liberties.
   Since 1975, Italy has had a much more permissive attitude toward
drug use than most Western European countries. That law allowed
possession of a ``moderate'' amount of drugs for personal use.
   It also left a loophole that permitted many sellers caught by
the police to claim drugs in their possession were for personal use.
   The new law adopted by Parliament on Tuesday makes it illegal to
use drugs in all amounts, though it remains lenient for those
caught with no more than a ``daily dose.''
   In the case of such small amounts, no penalties will be applied
for those who choose to undergo rehabilitation. The precise amount
of a daily dose will be defined later.
   If the user refuses treatment, however, his driver's license and
passport can be suspended up to three months. Further abuse can
bring jail up to three months.
   The new law also stiffens penalities for drug dealing. Those
convicted of trafficking in heroin or cocaine can be sentenced to
eight-to-20 years in prison and fined up to $420,000. The old law's
maximum penalty was 15 years and $83,500.
   The new law was adopted to combat a wave of social problems
related to drug use.
   Overdose deaths roughly doubled from 1987 to 1989. This year's
total is expected to be even higher, about 1,000.
   Also worrisome has been the spread of AIDS through contaminated
needles. Throwing a syringe away in a public place now can bring a
fine of up to $835.
   Also under the new law, marijuana users caught for the first
time will be issued a warning.
   The list of prohibited drugs includes heroin, cocaine,
hallucinogens, marijuana and hashish as well as amphetamines and
barbituates in amounts above medical doses.
   Opponents say the new law violates their civil liberties.

   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar said Wednesday he will dispatch a delegation to the
Israeli-occupied territories to investigate violence including
alleged abuses of Palestinians.
   He said the group would go early next week.
   The U.N. chief's announcement came one day after Israel's new
conservative government invited him to send a special envoy, but
Perez de Cuellar said he was already planning to send a team.
   U.N. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
delegation might depart for Israel as early as Monday night. The
group will be headed by Jean-Claude Aime, a director in the U.N.
Secretariat.
   U.N. officials said the secretary-general had been planning for
several weeks to send an investigative team to the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, where violence has escalated recently.
   On Tuesday evening, Perez de Cuellar summoned Israeli Ambassador
Johanan Bein to inform him of the plans. Bein told reporters
beforehand that ``Israel would initiate an invitation'' to the U.N.
team.
   He later said Israel would fully cooperate with the delegation.
   Perez de Cuellar told reporters the timing of Israel's
invitation was ``a coincidence.''
   Arab states had sought to dispatch a three-member team from the
Security Council. Israel opposed the move, and the United States
vetoed the plan in the Security Council.
   Arab League envoy Clovis Maksoud on Wednesday called the Israeli
statement that the invitation was its own initiative ``a deliberate
attempt to hijack the mission and rob it of its credibility and
relevance.''
   He also said the secretary-general's mission was independent of
Arab efforts to convene an emergency session of the General
Assembly or the Security Council on the deteriorating situation in
the occupied territories.
   Arab diplomats said they wanted the Security Council to give its
blessing to the secretary-general's mission and wanted to ensure
that the council would take action on the mission's report.
   In the past, Arab diplomts complained, reports by the
secretary-general on the occupied lands have not generated Security
Council action.
   The invitation by Israel was the first action in the
international arena of the new Israeli government.
   ``The government of Israel, on our own initiative, extends to
the secretary-general an invitation to (Secretariat Director)
Jean-Claude Aime to visit Israel as an envoy in the framework of a
visit to the region,'' Bein told reporters.
   Arab nations have said the policies of the new Israeli
government and the escalation of violence in the territories make
it imperative that the United Nations take emergency action to
protect Palestinians.
   The new government has said it will take tough measures to quell
the 30-month-old uprising.
   The territories were captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East
War and are claimed by the Palestinians as a future state.

   Ethnic violence killed 148 people and wounded 885
this month in the Central Asian republic of Kirghizia, the official
news agency Tass said Wednesday.
   Tass said 748 of the injured had to be hospitalized and said a
search was continuing for a police officer who vanished June 7.
   No new outbreaks were reported in the region near the border
city of Osh in western Kirghizia, where clashes arising from a land
dispute began on June 2 between ethnic Kirghiz and Uzbeks, both
Sunni Moslems.
   The argument involves allocation of land in a densly populated
region where housing is scarce. It was the latest in a series of
bloody civil conflicts to trouble President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
government.
   Maj. Gen. Alexander Grienko, chief of the Interior Ministry's
Political Department, said that in two years of civil strife _
mainly ethnic clashes _ in the Soviet Union, about 24,000 people
have been arrested.
   He said in Moscow on Tuesday that ministry troops had to be used
in 13 regions of the Soviet Union because of such outbreaks, Tass
said.
   Grienko said 16 ministry soldiers were killed, four were
reported missing and more than 1,000 wounded. Tass did not quote
Grienko on how civilians casualties.
   The general was quoted as saying these conflicts ``were often
accompanied by riots and pogroms, arson and massacre of innocent
people, (and) complete or partial destabilization of the
situation.''
   Besides unrest this month in Kirghizia and Uzbekistan, ethnic
violence also has been reported in recent years in Georgia,
Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Tadzhikistan.

<TEXT>
   Striking air traffic controllers
paralyzed flights nationwide Wednesday, but they went back to work
after the government agreed to their demand that a fired Sandinista
army officer be allowed to return to the job.
   The strike represented the latest confrontation between the
U.S.-backed government that took office in April and its leftist
Sandinista predecessors, who still control labor unions and the
military.
   The walkout by the Sandinista-led union of air traffic
controllers, which started Tuesday night, crippled Managua's
international airport and closed all Nicaraguan air space to
flights.
   Under Wednesday's settlement, Army Maj. Alejandro Arguello, who
was fired as chief of civil aeronautics on Saturday, will be asked
to return to the civil aeronautics department as adviser to his
replacement, said union leader Manuel Garcia. His replacement was
not announced.
   Jaime Icabalceta, the Construction and Transportation minister,
also agreed not to fire any public employees from the civil
aeronautics administration and to revise salary levels, Garcia said.
   ``We are now back to normal operations'' in the control tower,
said Garcia after Wednesday's talks.
   An Iberia flight was the first passenger plane to leave
Wednesday afternoon. Other airlines were checking in passengers who
had been forced to camp out all day at the airport.
   The government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, which
took over after defeating the Sandinistas in February elections,
has been hobbled by a wave of strikes.
   In May, Sandinista labor unions struck for two weeks, nearly
crippling the government. Air traffic controllers went on a
sympathy strike at that time for 48 hours.
   Officials have accused the Sandinista Front of promoting the
strikes to destabilize the government. The strikes are occurring as
Mrs. Chamorro is struggling to solidify her power and improve the
nation's economy, which was devastated by a decade of fighting
between U.S.-backed Contra rebels and the Sandinistas and an
embargo by the United States.
   The air controllers radioed their intention to begin the new
strike on Tuesday to a plane carrying Mrs. Chamorro back from Costa
Rica five minutes before it was supposed to land at Managua's
international airport, said controller Daniel Gonzalez.
   However, the president's plane was allowed to land before
controllers began shutting down air space 8 p.m. Tuesday.
   Mrs. Chamorro had been in neighboring Costa Rica for the funeral
of former Costa Rican President Jose Figueres.
   Interior Minister Carlos Hurtado spoke to the controllers from
the cockpit of the presidential plane, and the two sides opened the
private formal talks Wednesday at the international airport.
   Representing the government was Transport Minister Icabalceta.
Garcia, secretary general of the Civil Aeronautics Labor Union,
represented the strikers.
   Arguello was fired after the Icabalceta moved the post of
aeronautics chief from the military into the transport ministry.
   The controllers say the firing by the government violated an
agreement reached during the earlier round of strikes not to
dismiss civil servants.

<TEXT>
   Islamic fundamentalists who won a
majority of local council seats in Algeria's first multiparty
elections demanded Wednesday that Parliament be dissolved so they
can move to take national power.
   The victory by the Islamic Salvation Front in the nationwide
local elections marks a stunning triumph for Islamic hard-liners
and their 16-month-old party.
   A day after the vote, the fundamentalists called on President
Chadli Bendjedid to hold national elections within three months
instead of February 1992 as scheduled. The government had no
immediate response.
   The National Liberation Front had been widely expected to win
Tuesday's voting because of its grip on government machinery and
the media, as well as its greater financial resources. It holds
every seat in Parliament.
   But on Wednesday, before any official results were released,
Interior Minister Mohamed-Salah Mohammedi announced the
fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front had won a majority of the
15,000 seats at stake on 1,541 municipal and 48 provincial councils.
   First official results released later Wednesday _ more than 24
hours after the voting ended _ showed the fundamentalists captured
327 of the 612 municipal council seats counted so far. The
governing party won 208 seats, or 33 percent.
   The interior minister said the partial official returns
indicated the anti-clerical Rally for Culture and Democracy had won
51 seats in Tuesday's voting, with independents and the tiny
National Party for Solidarity and Development taking the rest.
   The interior minister said complications had delayed the count
and full results would be unavailable before Thursday.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse, citing sources,
said the fundamentalists captured councils in Algeria's four
largest cities _ Algiers, Oran, Constantine and Annaba _ and swept
45 of the 48 provincial councils.
   Abassi Madani, the philosophy professor who heads the Islamic
Salvation Front, denied his movement wishes to turn the country
into a one-party religious state.
   ``We guarantee the freedom of all who have ideas on Algeria's
future,'' he said.
   ``The Algerian people are not stupid,'' added Madani, 59. ``The
truth is the best way to answer all questions.''
   Algeria's Islamic Salvation Front seeks to establish the Islamic
legal code, the Sharia, as law.
   The party assigns women to a subservient role. None of the
front's 12,000 candidates for office in Tuesday's voting were women.
   For months, fundamentalist supporters have been accused of
harassing single women and disrupting nightclubs in Algiers.
   The fundamentalist party boasts 650,000 members. Many are drawn
from the ranks of unemployed youth, attracted by its fiery mix of
Islam and politics.
   Madani thanked the governing party for holding the elections,
the first multiparty voting since the North African country won
independence from France in 1962.
   The centrist Front of Socialist Forces headed by Berber leader
Hocine Ait Ahmed and the populist, left-leaning Movement for
Democracy led by former president Ahmed Ben Bella had charged that
the governing party would rig the vote.
   From exile in Switzerland, Ben Bella on Wednesday called the
fundamentalist win a vote of no-confidence in the governing party
and urged ``really free'' elections for Parliament in the near
future.
   Officials of all parties complained Wednesday of widespread
irregularities, including multiple voting, missing ballots and
interference at polling places by outsiders and election officials.
   The official APS news agency reported that about 40 percent of
the voters had abstained, according to the partial count. About 13
million people were registered to vote.
   In France, Algeria's former colonial ruler and home to hundreds
of thousands of Algerian immigrants, Youth and Sports Minister
Roger Bambuck indicated the results would cause alarm in French
government ranks.
   ``It's with great sadness that I see the rise of fundamentalism
in Algeria,'' he said in a radio interview. ``Every time one sees
dogmatism on the rise, whether political or religious, it's liberty
that is in danger.''
   In Iran, state Tehran Radio said the results were ``part of the
wave of Islamization that has gripped northern African nations
simultaneously.''
   ``The development of Islamic feeling in these countries is
similar to Algeria, but it is suppressed by the ruling regimes,''
the radio said.
   In Tunisia, one of Algeria's neighbors, the main Islamic group
was barred from nationwide local elections Sunday.
   The official news agency reported several groups of Islamic
supporters tried to overrun some Algiers voting stations, alleging
the vote-counting was influenced by the government.
   A number of voters in Algiers were turned away from polling
booths when they appeared without required documents.
   The governing party was the sole political party in the nation
of 24 million people until constitutional changes in February 1989
opened the way to competing parties.
   The party was forced to end its monopoly on power after soldiers
killed scores of people in October 1988 riots sparked by
deteriorating economic conditions.

<HEAD>Italy Withdraws Venice as Fair Site</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Giulio Andreotti said Tuesday his government
was withdrawing Venice as a candidate for Expo 2000, a world's fair.
   The Bureau of International Expositions, headquartered in Paris,
was expected to select the host city on Thursday. With Venice out
of the running, the choice was narrowed to Hanover, West Germany,
and Toronto.
   Critics cited the mess the tourist-swamped lagoon city was left
with last summer after a Pink Floyd concert drew 100,000 young
people to St. Mark's Square. They argued that the fair would
further strain Venice, whose canals can't handle the sewage that
spills out of hotels and restaurants.
   Under the proposal, Venice would have been the centerpiece of
the international showcase of cultural and scientific exhibits.
Other cities in the immediate region would have acted as host for
some of the attractions.
   Last week, Andreotti went before Parliament to defend the
candidacy and promised that Parliament would have the last word on
the plan should Venice get the go-ahead from Paris.
   Andreotti's government, like Venice itself, was divided over the
candidacy. Some argued that the fair would help relaunch the city,
which has seen Venetians flee to solid ground, leaving Venice to
tourists and real-estate speculators.
   Last month, the European Parliament voted overwhelmingly against
the project and asked Italy to withdraw the candidacy.
   ``A senseless plan has failed and Venice can thus breathe a sigh
of relief,'' said Italian Carlo Ripa di Meana, the European
Community's environmental commissioner.
   On Monday, 300 members of the 630-seat Chamber of Deputies
signed a petition against the candidacy following opposition
expressed by 180 senators in the 324-member upper house.
   Andreotti announced the withdrawal in a meeting with Senate
leaders.
   A communique from his office took note of the parliamentary
opposition, but added: ``It goes without saying that the great
problems of crowding, renewal and utilizing the abandoned quarters
of Venice remain even leaving out the exposition.''
   By the late 1980s, Venice had 80,000 people, compared to 175,000
in the 1950s. Butchers, grocers and plumbers have been closing
their shops along the narrow, zigzagging streets of the carless
city, and souvenir vendors are taking their spots. A study
presented two years ago predicted there could be as few as 20,000
Venetians left by the year 2015.
   Many buildings are uninhabitable. The lagoon lapping at their
ground floors and salty sea air wear away foundations and beams.
   The lagoon's black-green waters have also been plagued by
bad-smelling algae, which feed on detergents and other chemicals
dumped into the sea.

   Mrs. Mosbacher was getting off an elevator on the 20th floor of
the Barbizon Plaza Hotel when a man with a gun confronted her, said
Sgt. Ed Burns.
   The man, described as well dressed, took Mrs. Mosbacher's
wedding ring, watch, earrings, two other rings and $400 in cash,
then ran down the stairs, Burns said.
   Mrs. Mosbacher, who was a guest at the hotel, is president of
her own cosmetics business, La Prairie, and is well-known in New
York and Washington social circles.

   Faced with a splintering empire, Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev is proposing to counter secessionist drives by
transforming the Soviet Union into a looser federation of sovereign
states, officials say.
   The Soviet leader has also significantly softened his position
on German reunification, saying a united Germany could be an
``associate member'' of the NATO alliance while at the same time
joining a new pan-European security order.
   He did not define exactly what ``associate membership'' would
entail, but the Kremlin up to now has opposed a new Germany whose
sole military allegiance is to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   Gorbachev made his proposal about the Soviet republics on
Tuesday, the same day the parliament of the huge Russian republic
approved a resolution declaring its laws to carry more weight than
federal statutes.

   Black candidates won primaries for governor of South Carolina
and lieutenant governor of Arkansas, propelling them into uphill
general election races against powerful opponents.
   In the Arkansas race, businessman Kenneth ``Muskie'' Harris
trounced Ku Klux Klan sympathizer Ralph Forbes by more than a 6-1
margin on Tuesday to win the Republican nomination for lieutenant
governor.
   In South Carolina, state Sen. Theo Mitchell soundly defeated
state Sen. Ernest Passailaigue in the Democratic gubernatorial
primary.
   In one other election with racial overtones, the first black
mayor of Atlantic City, N.J., James L. Usry, was ousted by a white
challenger in a runoff. Usry was recently indicted on corruption
charges.

   President Bush's string of successful vetoes
remains unbroken, but Democrats are maneuvering for a second chance
to force an Amtrak aid bill into law over his objections.
   Bush emerged Tuesday with the 11th veto of his term intact after
Democrats failed by three votes to muster the two-thirds majority
needed to override the president's veto of a bill to support the
rail service.
   The president vetoed the $2 billion authorization bill last
month because it also would have required that the Interstate
Commerce Commission approve acquisitions of major freight railroads
by non-railroad companies.
   Republicans promised during Tuesday's debate that Bush would
support a substitute bill continuing support for the passenger rail
service as long as the regulatory provision is omitted.

   Texas banks are back in the black after more
than four years of steady losses, while once-thriving Massachusetts
institutions have become the industry's biggest money-losers.
   Nationally, commercial banks earned $6.2 billion in the first
three months of 1990, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said
Tuesday. The performance, except for a sharp earnings dip in the
last half of 1989, was in line with bank profits over the past two
years.
   But the overall performance masked dramatic turnarounds in some
states.
   Texas banks, which lost $42 million during the first quarter of
1989, turned a profit of $164 million in the first quarter of this
year. It was their first quarter in the black since the last
quarter of 1985.
   Massachusetts banks went the other direction. They earned $202
million in the first quarter last year but lost $171 million in the
January-March 1990 period, the worst loss of any state. The other
states to post losses were New Hampshire and Rhode Island _ which
border Massachusetts _ and Arizona.

   Government officials say Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh acted within the law in heading discussions on revising
the Clean Air Act even though 20 percent of his assets are in
stocks affected by the legislation.
   President Bush granted ethics-law waivers to Thornburgh last
spring so the attorney general could head Domestic Policy Council
discussions leading to proposals to amend the Clean Air Act,
administration officials said.
   Thornburgh needed the waivers because he held $149,827 in stocks
and bonds in 12 major industrial and oil companies and a public
utility, Alvin A. Schall, a Thornburgh aide, said Tuesday.
   These holdings amounted to 20 percent of the attorney general's
assets of $722,083, Schall said.

   And when is a freebie golf trip considered a gift? Only when
lawmakers say so.
   In 1988, the Pennsylvania Manufacturing Association spent a
reported $20,000 entertaining seven lawmakers at a Florida golf
resort. Only one reported the outing, although three others said
they went but didn't consider it a gift.
   Lawmakers can get free movie passes in Pennsylvania, free lift
tickets at ski resorts in Utah, race track tickets in Maryland,
college basketball tickets in Kentucky and all sorts of freebies to
professional sports.
   Take a ticket in Wisconsin, however, and you'll be criminally
prosecuted. Wisconsin is the only state that bars lawmakers from
taking anything of value _ even a cup of coffee.
   Four Wisconsin senators were fined for accepting free lodging
from a special interest while attending a Chicago Bears-Green Bay
Packers football game. In a separate case, the Tobacco Institute
was fined for giving tickets to a state senator for the Los Angeles
Lakers-Boston Celtics basketball game during a legislative trip to
Boston.
   Thirteen states set limits on the value of gifts a legislator
can accept from a single lobbyist, ranging from a $10 per month in
California to $100 per gift in West Virginia.
   But there's plenty of room for ambiguity. Despite Nebraska's
limit of $25 per gift, a lobbyist onced hauled a senator around
with a private plane until state officials intervened.
   Dannie Trautwein, executive director of the state's
Accountability and Disclosure Commission, said the lobbyist was
lectured on the intent of the state's lobbying law. But no one was
prosecuted because of the vagaries of defining a gift.
   ``He looked me right in the eye and said the plane was just
going in the same direction as the senator and anbyody could have
gotten on it,'' Trautwein said.

   Wisconsin is the only state that does not permit lawmakers to
let anyone pay for their meals or drinks. One state _ California _
has rules that say lobbyists should file reports listing any
legislator they take out for dinner or drinks.
   Thirty-one other states have spending ``thresholds'' above which
lobbyists must identify the legislator on whom entertainment money
is spent, although the limits often are high enough that lobbyists
rarely have to say who they have entertained. Seventeen states have
no requirements that lobbyists ever identify legislators who are
wined and dined.
   Here are the states with thresholds:
   _Arizona: $25 per meal, per issue discussed.
   _Arkansas: $25 per meal.
   _Colorado: $50 over a year.
   _Connecticut: $50 per meal.
   _Delaware: $50 per day.
   _Hawaii: $25 per meal, or $150 over six months.
   _Idaho: $50 per meal.
   _Illinois: $25 per meal.
   _Indiana: $100 per meal, or $500 over a year.
   _Maine: $25 over a month.
   _Maryland: $75 per year per lobbying client, counting only meals
that cost more than $15.
   _Massachusetts: $35 per meal.
   _Michigan: $35 per month, $275 over first six months, or $275
over full year.
   _Minnesota: $50 per meal.
   _Mississippi: $25 per meal.
   _Montana: $25 per meal.

<HEAD>Campaign Money Exerts Pressure on Lobbyists, Legislators</HEAD>

   The telephone message slips were
piling up on lobbyist Loren Smith's desk. The callers were state
legislators, and their message was written between the lines. They
wanted money.
   Smith looked across the big wooden desk, across his spacious
modern office and out the windows that framed the state Capitol
gleaming in the sun. After 25 years as a lobbyist, he was troubled
by what he saw.
   Like most lobbyists, Smith helps his clients dole out campaign
contributions to legislators. It's a role that empowers lobbyists,
guarantees their telephone calls will be returned and their faces
remembered when they argue for their clients' interests. It can
give them influence beyond that of the voters whom legislators
ostensibly serve.
   But increasingly, it is giving them pause.
   Legislators' appetites for campaign funds are insatiable, and
lobbyists say they can't fill the lawmakers' plates fast enough.
   ``I've never had to buy a vote in my life, nor do I intend to,''
said Smith, whose clients include such corporate giants as Dow
Chemical and Pillsbury.
   And yet, he feels intense pressure to give money to legislators.
The unspoken implication is that he'll lose his influence if he
doesn't.
   ``The pressure for money doesn't come from us,'' he said. ``I'm
not running over there'' _ he gestures toward the Capitol _
``saying, `Can I give you some money for a vote?' I'm saying'' _
and now he slaps his forehead _ ```Oh God, another request!'''
   Other lobbyists say the same thing, and not just in Sacramento.
Across the nation, legislative campaign spending is careening out
of control and lobbyists can't _ or won't _ stop stoking the
engines.
   ``The problem is that the legislators have gotten as greedy as
the lobbyists,'' said state Sen. Julian L. Lapides of Maryland.
   The cost of running for public office has risen ever faster in
the past decade, pulled by the lure of television advertising and
pushed by the stick of competition.
   Legislative campaign expenses in California rose 180 percent
between 1978 and 1988; the average race cost $610,000 by the end of
that period. No other state is so costly, but campaign spending is
the talk of statehouses from coast to coast.
   Campaign expenses rose 442 percent in Alaska between 1976 and
1988. Costs doubled in New Jersey between 1983 and 1987; quadrupled
in Illinois between 1980 and 1988; and quintupled for Washington
state Senate races between 1976 and 1986.
   ``It is out of hand. There's no question about it,'' said H.
Donald Stewart, a New Jersey lobbyist who formerly served in that
state's Assembly. When he first ran for office 25 years ago,
$25,000 was considered a huge campaign warchest.
   ``Today, they make that on one fundraiser,'' Stewart said. ``And
then they have a long way to go.''
   In the trade route of campaign finance, moneyed interests are on
one coast and politicians on the other. Lobbyists navigate between
the two. They advise clients on how much to give and to whom, and
they frequently deliver the money.
   Maryland lobbyist Bruce Bereano figures he'll have a hand in
dispensing $150,000 in campaign funds this year. ``That's a
conservative figure,'' he added. ``It depends on how the races
shape up.''
   Those with money aren't necessarily picky about who gets it.
Frequently, lobbyists will recommend that clients give to both
candidates in a close race _ just to make sure they help out the
winner.
   ``It's like going to the racetrack and making a bet after the
race,'' said Barry Kauffman of Pennsylvania Common Cause, which
lobbies for open government and is critical of lobbyists' influence.
   Lobbyists in most states also buy tickets to legislative
fundraising parties, which have become almost nightly events in
most state capitals.
   In Sacramento or Albany, N.Y., tickets to fundraisers are
frequently $500 or $1,000 each and lobbyists can be invited to as
many as five or six in an evening. Richard Dugally, a lobbyist for
Ford Motor Co. in Sacramento, figured he could have spent $105,000
in 1988 by buying one ticket to every fundraiser he was asked to
attend. He bought none because it's Ford's policy not to do so.
   In some states, lobbyists are asked to do more than just buy
tickets; they're expected to sell them, too. Lapides, the Maryland
legislator, said some of his colleagues expect lobbyists to sell as
many as 200 tickets each to fundraisers.
   ``A lobbyist can then become the prime fundraiser for a
legislator,'' Lapides said. ``A legislator would find it impossible
to view them, or legislation that the lobbyist has before that
legislator, objectively.''
   That gets to the heart of the issue: that lobbyists exert
influence beyond that of an ordinary voter.
   Most say their influence derives from the interest groups they
represent, not the money they spend. And at least some of the time,
that's true.
   In California, environmental lobbyists exert a powerful
influence, despite being outspent by wealthier opponents. In
Delaware, legislators say the most powerful lobbyists are those who
represent volunteer firefighters, whose ladders of influence extend
to nearly every home in the state.
   Lobbyists say campaign contributions don't buy votes. They buy
access, or a friendly relationship, or a sympathetic ear.
   Yet there is sometimes a fine line between access and influence.
   Last year, Oregon state Sen. Wayne Fawbush disappointed
environmentalists by voting against a bill to protect a stand of
old-growth trees _ a bill that Fawbush, considered a leading
preservationist, had sponsored.
   Later, it was revealed Fawbush had received $12,000 in campaign
contributions from the timber industry the previous election year.
   ``It tells us that the thousands of dollars he took from the
timber industry counted when the chips were down,'' said Terry
Nelson, the former executive director of Oregon Common Cause.
   Fawbush denied he had sold his vote, but conceded campaign
contributions buy influence.
   ``If you have a large contributor, it's only human nature that
you're going to listen to them,'' he said. ``But listening can't be
equated to being bought.''
   In New Mexico, state Sen. Shannon Robinson said he hadn't been
getting contributions from oil and gas companies _ until he
introduced a resolution calling on the state to study them. Right
away, the money started flowing in, he said.
   ``I had to express an interest in an industry in order to get
that industry's support,'' Robinson said.
   In that instance, the resolution didn't benefit the industry and
had no binding effect. Robinson said he always has the best
interest of voters at heart, and hasn't changed a vote because of
the financial influence of a lobbyist.
   Still, he said, ``You get that kind of money and you think twice
about the commitment those people made, and you try to help them
with your vote when you can.''
   Nevada Assemblyman Jim Banner said he cared deeply about what
his constituents had to say. But constituents were rarely among his
major campaign donors. And aside from a few zealots, he rarely
heard from the people in his district.
   ``I like to feel clean about it,'' Banner said before he retired
this year. ``But hell, a lot of times I push that button and I have
no idea what my constituents want.''

<HEAD>Door From the Legislature Leads to the Lobby</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-The Persuaders III</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   There are no college degrees in legislative lobbying, no
entrance exams and no written qualifications. But there is one sure
way to become a lobbyist _ become a legislator first.
   In nearly every state, the ranks of the most successful
lobbyists are filled with former legislators, former legislative
aides and the occasional former governor or congressman. Just as
those with money are attracted to the power of legislators, so are
legislators attracted to the allures of money.
   It's hardly surprising. The highest paid legislators, those in
New York state, earn under $60,000 a year; the lowest paid, those
in New Hampshire, earn a token $100 a year.
   Good lobbyists in almost any state can earn more than $100,000 a
year. In the biggest states, they can become millionaires.
   ``We resent it,'' said Alaska state Senate President Tim Kelly,
who earns about $30,000 a year. ``The disparity between the
legislator and the lobbyist is outrageous.''
   But many legislators swallow their resentment and walk through
the revolving door.
   There are more than two dozen former legislators working as
lobbyists in Oklahoma, at least 50 in Texas, 35 in Illinois, 28 in
New Mexico. When the North Carolina Center for Public Policy
Research ranked lobbyists in that state according to their clout,
six of the top 10 and eight of the top 15 were former legislators.
   In some states, such as Oklahoma and South Carolina, former
legislators have at least one advantage over other lobbyists _ they
are allowed onto the floor of the legislature during sessions.
   ``These other guys have to stay out there in the foyer,'' said
South Carolina Rep. Herb Kirsh. ``These guys can come in, sit down,
kneel by your desk and talk to you.''
   Beyond that, former legislators bring a wealth of advantages to
the lobby. They know the names and faces. They know how laws are
made. They know how the political game is played.
   ``When hiring lobbyists, people ask who has special ins with the
legislature,'' said Lester Brann, president of the Illinois State
Chamber of Commerce. ``Well, former members of the Legislature have
special ins with the Legislature.''
   Few states have restrictions on how soon legislators can become
lobbyists after giving up their seats, although some public
interest groups support a cooling-off period between jobs.
   The most common path from legislator to lobbyist is the one
followed by former Assemblyman Roger Bremner of Nevada, who became
a lobbyist after running for the state Senate and losing.
   Bremner didn't go hunting for clients _ the news of his loss was
as good as a ``Work Wanted'' ad. Although his background didn't
guarantee success for his clients, it didn't hurt, either.
   ``I know a lot of the players,'' Bremner said. ``I know where
the men's room is. I know how the system works.''

<TEXT>
   Nearly everyone complains about the high cost of campaigning,
but state legislatures have been unable, or unwilling, to adopt
regulations that would control the campaign arms race.
   Common Cause, among other groups, has argued that public
financing is necessary if candidates are to be freed from the leash
of special interests. That's because courts have ruled that states
may not limit campaign spending unless they offer candidates public
money.
   Yet only four states have any form of public financing of
legislative races, and it hasn't put a lid on campaign spending in
all of those states.
   Many people also worry about the propriety of legislators
receiving contributions when they are actively considering
legislation, but only six states bar candidates from receiving
contributions during legislative sessions.
   States can limit the size of contributions, however, and many
have.
   Twenty-seven have set a maximum on how much an individual can
contribute to a single legislative candidate. These range from $220
per year in Arizona to $4,000-$9,092 per election for Senate
candidates in New York.
   Seventeen states limit how much individuals can give to
political action committees, ranging from $1,000 per year in
Connecticut and Massachusetts to $150,000 per year in New York.
   California voters set a limit of $1,000 per contribution in
1988; that rule is getting its first test this year. Some fear it
will put even more pressure on legislators to raise funds because
they'll have to get more individual contributions to raise the same
amount of money.

<TEXT>
   If Ronald Reagan's New Federalism did nothing
else, it taught Washington's lobbying corps that there is life _
and politics _ outside the Beltway.
   A surge of activity in state capitols has set off a political
equivalent of the Gold Rush: Washington lobbyists flocking to
lucrative diggings in Jefferson City and Juneau, Sacramento and
Santa Fe, Boston and Baton Rouge.
   They have worked quietly, often unseen. But they have brought a
new, sophisticated style of politics to state capitals, where
old-fashioned shoe-leather lobbying is now augmented by television
ad campaigns and computer-generated grassroots organizing.
   ``There's been a huge explosion of interest in the state
level,'' said Paul Hallman, one of the founding partners of
Multistate Associates, a lobbying firm with offices in Washington
and Great Neck, N.Y.
   Multistate, which may be the largest firm of its type, maintains
a roster of 1,500 local lobbyists in all 50 states. It hires them
out to such clients as Apple Computer, Bristol-Myers, Citicorp,
Johnson &amp; Johnson, Metropolitan Life, Nabisco, Playtex, Procter &amp;
Gamble and Union Carbide.
   ``You can come to us and we can reach out anywhere in the
country,'' said Steve Markowitz, the firm's other founding partner.
   Multistate, established in 1984, was among the first national
lobbying firms to capitalize on the state legislative bonanza, but
it is not alone.
   Hill &amp; Knowlton, the huge public relations firm, recently
entered the competition by buying out an established lobbying
company, Hoog &amp; Associates of Boulder, Colo.
   Tom Hoog, a former aide to Sen. Gary Hart who founded the firm,
now works for Hill &amp; Knowlton as a senior vice president. So far
this year, he said, Hill &amp; Knowlton has been active in 34 or 35
states and monitors legislation in all 50. He wouldn't name the
company's clients.
   Hill &amp; Knowlton has offices in only two state capitals _ Denver
and Tallahassee, Fla. _ but Hoog said that will change soon. ``As I
look down the road a couple years, I see us opening offices in 10
to 15 capitals, minimum,'' he said.
   Special interest groups and corporations, too, are sending their
own lobbyists into the states in growing numbers. ``The states are
the battlefield,'' said Florida lobbyist Lee Moffitt. ``The real
power is in the legislature.''
   The actual number of bills considered by legislatures has
remained about the same the past decade _ it hovers around 200,000
a year for all 50 states, according to the National Conference of
State Legislatures.
   But the nature of the bills has changed. The issues are bigger,
the stakes higher. Smoking. Abortion. Assault rifles. Toxic waste.
Tort reform. AIDS. All are issues that once might have fallen
solely under the purview of the federal government. Now each can be
found on the agenda of nearly every legislature.
   Some credit President Reagan's New Federalism with stimulating
statehouse lobbying by restoring power and responsibility to the
states.
   ``By that yardstick, you'd have to say he was a major success,
because issues did move to the states,'' said Hoog.
   Not that the federal government withered. It grew larger than
ever in the Reagan years. But the Reagan administration certainly
relinquished responsibility for some domestic tasks. And many
critics say the Congress became a more difficult place to do
business _ more politically charged, less open to consensus.
   Richard Gardiner, head of state government relations for the
National Rifle Association, calls the New Federalism ``a lot of
baloney.''
   ``I think that the answer is that those who believe in more
regulation have decided that the states are the next fertile field.
The federal government can't do anything more. They've regulated so
much, there's nothing left to regulate,'' he said.
   Gardiner speaks with some bitterness; his group has lost some
tough battles over the right to own semiautomatic weapons. Still,
the NRA can claim one of the most impressive track records of any
lobbying group. It combines the tactical savvy of nine seasoned
lobbyists with the grassroots clout of nearly 3 million members.
   The NRA's legislative lobbyists are the paratroopers of
politics. There are seven in Washington, covering the eastern
two-thirds of the nation, and two in Sacramento, Calif., covering
the western third. They spend their days zooming from one capital
to the next in a never-ending war against gun control.
   ``Our lobbyist for New England, for example, will go up to
Albany (New York) for an afternoon, take a flight over to Portland
or Augusta, Maine, spend the next morning there and then go down to
Rhode Island ... that afternoon, and then zip over to Connecticut
and come home,'' Gardiner said.
   NRA lobbyists are backed up by a grassroots organizing machine
that is the envy of lobbyists everywhere. The NRA spends millions
of dollars sending mail to its members, who respond with letters,
telephone calls and personal visits to legislators.
   That kind of support is what other lobbyists are trying to
cultivate.
   Once, ``grassroots'' suggested a brand of politics that was
unsophisticated, unplanned and inexpensive _ a spontaneous movement
on behalf of a candidate or cause.
   Now, with the help of the image-makers, grassroots lobbying can
be slick, calculated and costly.
   Its aim is to persuade legislators that a lobbyist's position
has popular support. The techniques can be as simple as a letter to
citizens asking them to call or write their legislators. They can
be as sophisticated as television commercials that subtly shift the
public mood.
   ``I hate for anybody to refer to me as just a lobbyist anymore,
because I don't think there's a market for just straight
lobbying,'' said Hill &amp; Knowlton's Hoog. ``I think you have to
provide a base of support for your position.''
   Gary Nordlinger is a specialist in drumming up that support. His
Washington office is dominated by a large, wooden bookcase filled
not with books, but with audio and video tapes. They represent his
most tangible product.
   One videotape is a commercial produced for the Nevada State
Education Association several years ago to bolster its clout at the
legislature. Viewers were shown images of state prison inmates. The
point: Nevadans could spend money on schools now or prisons later.
   ``It's now becoming increasingly common to do in a state capital
what's been done in Congress, which is not only to use your
lobbyist, but to rally public support, to run advocacy media, to do
grassroots lobbying as well to get people to contact their
legislators,'' Nordlinger said.
   ``Legislatures can be a lot more fun to work than the Congress,
too. ... You know, if the Congress is a full-blown railroad, a
state legislature is much more like a model train. Much easier to
have a big impact.''

   Nordlinger's firm is just one of several that assist lobbyists
nationwide without actually doing any lobbying themselves. They are
an unregulated and potentially potent force that is one part of the
future of legislative lobbying.
   Another glint of things to come shines in the 27th floor offices
of TRW Inc. in Arlington, Va. From this steel and glass aerie
overlooking Washington, Ernie Labelle shapes TRW's sophisticated
approach to state legislative lobbying.
   Labelle, who directs state and constituent relations for the
huge space and defense contractor, talks about government as a
``partner'' and says business must do more than respond to
legislation _ it must shape it.
   TRW employs a ``vice president for public policy analysis''
whose full-time job, essentially, is to think deeply about
important issues. It doesn't matter whether they have anything to
do with TRW directly; the company sees benefits in the most
tangential things.
   On a more down-to-earth level, TRW sends lobbyists into 15 or 20
states a year. It also has designed a computerized ``constituent
network'' that allows Labelle to instantly tap into the company's
50,000-plus employees in the United States and get them on the
phone to their legislators.
   ``It's a very structured, focused, disciplined, systems approach
to grassroots lobbying,'' he said.

   ``I fall and it is so hard to get up. I feel, `What is the use?'
There are the drought of the land, emotional upheavals and
spiritual droughts. I feel depression and sometimes despair. It

   When Seneca County farmer William Smith gets
up at dawn, he looks out a window at his rich farm land and wonders
about his family's future.
   In recent years, he's seen a soil-parching drought that withered
crops in the field, and rains that left farm land a muddy mess,
delaying planting and cutting yields.
   He has watched friends lose their farms, and helped comfort
their families while their possessions were sold at auction.
   Through such uncertainty, Smith and his family find strength
through Jesus and ``The Way of the Cross for Those in Rural Life,''
a 32-page religious pamphlet written by farmers and others involved
in agriculture.
   ``We make mistakes and we fall. Jesus fell three times on his
way to the cross and every time he fell he got back up. That's the
way we look at trouble we've having on the farm. You have to pick
yourself back up when you fall,'' the 39-year-old father of two
said in an interview.
   This is the second year the pamphlet has been published by the
Roman Catholic Diocese of Toledo's Rural Life Ministries, an
organization that helps farmers and migrant farm workers.
   Sister Christine Pratt, ministries' director, said the booklet
is popular with people engaged in agriculture. It is used in many
rural parishes for devotional services.
   ``It is a spiritual walk with Jesus along the traditional
stations of Jesus' trial, sufferings, death and resurrection, but
includes meditations written by growers, dairy people, and others
who are sensitive to the dependence on the growing cycles of
nature,'' Sister Pratt said.
   The idea of publishing the pamphlet came to her in the summer of
1988 when a drought threatened the livelihoods of many farmers.
   Farm couples or individuals involved in food issues and migrant
farm workers were asked to write their feelings, based on Scripture
involving Jesus' walk to his crucifixion.
   The booklet is popular with farmers because the passages are
written by people who understand the pain they go through, she said.
   ``They are written by our brothers, our sisters, our neighbors,
our friends _ people who have been able to help us see how we can
take the passion of Jesus and identify with it in a way that is
close to our own experience,'' she said.
   ``I have given them to individual farmers, whether they be
Catholic or Protestant. Many of them are in the middle of
foreclosures and I give it to them to pray over, so they know that
someone else is sharing what they're going through,'' she said.
   Smith and his wife, Jane, 37, wrote a passage for the booklet,
based on when Jesus starts on his way to Calvary.
   ``Jesus silently accepted the rough wooden cross, though he had
committed no wrong. Consider the farmer and the farm family who
depend on variables out of their control. The weather,
international trade and government policies have all affected the
farmer,'' the Smiths wrote.
   ``As a result, many farmers or their spouses have been forced to
find work off the farm to supplement their income. In dealing with
this stress, some farmers withdraw from family and friends and face
the loneliness that Jesus must have felt when betrayed by Peter.''
   Mrs. Smith, 37, recalls when she and her husband wrote the
passage.
   ``It was during the drought, when farmers were having so much
trouble through a variety of things. I saw several friends
experience anguish. I sat down and prayed about it, and this is
what I thought of and decided to contribute,'' she said.
   Whenever the Smiths feel depressed about problems on their
800-acre dairy farm, they take solace in the pamphlet.
   ``It's beautiful because of the contributions from so many
people. It helps us pray to the Lord. We can all associate with the
sufferings of Christ,'' she said.
   Farmers in the past decade contended with foreclosures, land
depreciation, inflation, low commodity prices, bad weather and
shrinking markets.
   Agricultural experts say conditions should improve in the 1990s,
but more for commercial farmers than the small part time or family
farmer.
   ``It's rough for many farmers,'' Smith said. ``Some don't think
things will get much better. But you always have to have hope. When
you fall, you have to get up.''

   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) The world's Christian population grew by
about 326 million during the past decade to an estimated 1.75
billion, says a noted expert on religious statistics.
   The Rev. David Barrett, an Anglican priest, editor of the World
Christian Encyclopedia and now a consultant to the Southern Baptist
Foreign Mission Board, cited the figures in the International
Bulletin of Missionary Research.
   The new total amounts to about 33 percent of the world's 5.3
billion people, including 963 million Roman Catholics, 324 million
Protestants, 180 million Eastern Orthodox and 54 million Anglicans,
the ecumenical fortnightly, Christianity Today, reports.
   Another 232 million apparently were unclassified in those
groupings.

<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arguments about water are complicating
relations with Arab neighbors that Turkey spent a quarter-century
building.
   A conflict over the waters of the Euphrates River has soured
relations with Syria and Iraq. Reports that Turkey planned to sell
water to Israel have angered the Arab world generally.
   Libya refuses to pay $250 million it owes Turkish construction
companies, citing increased friendliness between Turkey and Israel,
a diplomatic source said privately.
   Economists and scientists say rapidly growing populations in the
Middle East could cause a disastrous water shortage.
   Turkey has plenty of water, much of it running unharnessed into
the surrounding seas.
   It averted one dispute over the precious resource by backing off
a proposed project with Medusa Inc. of Canada for moving water from
the Manavgat River in southern Turkey to other countries,
government and company official said.
   Medusa has developed a technology for transporting water in
huge, balloon-like plastic containers pulled by ships.
   Italy showed interest in using the method to transport water to
the islands of Sicily and Sardinia, and Israel also was looking
into it, the officials said.
   Turkish officials described the project, requiring an investment
of about $200 million, as a private venture with no political
dimension. They said private firms would buy and ship the water for
other countries.
   Arab nations apparently did not accept that explanation, which
ignored the fact that the Turkish government would be selling the
water, and Turkey did not go through with the deal. Medusa, worried
about possible terrorist action, also was said to be having second
thoughts.
   Foreign Minister Ali Bozer said in a recent statement that
``there is no project to sell water to Israel.''
   He also said Turkey had not received a positive reply to a
proposal to provide ``friendly Arab countries'' with water.
   His reference was to the ``peace pipeline'' proposal put forth
several years ago by Turgut Ozal, then premier.
   Under it, a 1,500-mile pipeline would carry water from the
Seyhan and Ceyhan rivers in the south to the Arabian peninsula. The
project would require an investment of $21 billion.
   Shelving the water transport project may have averted a
political crisis, but no simple solution is possible in a dispute
over Euphrates water.
   Turkey blocked most of the river's flow in January to raise the
water level in the reservoir of the Ataturk Dam, being built as the
centerpiece of a huge irrigation and power project in southeastern
Turkey.
   Syria and Iraq protested the action, which demonstrated Turkey's
stranglehold on the vital waters.
   The Euphrates originates in the mountains of eastern Turkey and
flows 1,460 miles through Syria and Iraq to a confluence with the
Tigris River that empties into the Persian Gulf. The two rivers
have been the lifelines of one of the cradles of world civilization.
   Water disputes have threatened to undo a generation of Turkish
efforts to improve relations with the Arabs. Turkey has supported
Arab causes in international forums, joined the Islamic Conference
Organization and demoted relations with Israel from the
ambassadorial to minister-counselor level.
   Syria and Iraq now demand talks with Turkey on an agreement to
specify the exact amount of water each will receive from the
Euphrates. Turkey has suggested a ministerial meeting in Ankara,
but Turkish officials say privately they have no intention of
accepting a quota system.
   There are no international rules to force Turkey into a sharing
agreement, government officials say, and they describe the demands
of the two southern neighbors as excessive.
   At a meeting last year, Iraq demanded 25 billion cubic meters of
water and and Syria 14 billion from the average annual flow of 32
billion cubic meters, the Turkish officials said.
   Instead, Turkey has offered free electricity to Syria and joint
irrigation projects to both countries.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama's justice system, once
considered the lapdog of a corrupt military, now is accused of
being a glacially slow institution whose prosecutors take bribes to
bury cases.
   Of more than 5,000 cases received by the attorney general's
office in the first four months of 1990, after the U.S. invasion
that ousted Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, none had gone to court by
early June.
   Edgardo Molino Mola, a Supreme Court justice, told reporters
more than 13,000 cases were pending in one judicial district where
the number of judges was fixed by law at 53.
   Opinions on how to change the situation range from revising the
law on judicial procedures to requiring that all judges have some
legal training.
   Deputy prosecutor Rosa de Contreras told The Associated Press:
``The problem is not with the prosecutors ... but with the law that
establishes court terms we must follow. ... The law has not been
changed.''
   Juan Materno Vasquez, former chief justice of the Supreme Court,
said the law is fine, but complained of ``inexperience and a lack
of technical preparation of appointed judges, some of whom have
never even been lawyers.''
   Molino Mola said more judges and courtrooms were needed.
   In San Milguelito, a working-class suburb of Panama City, he
said, ``there are 1,200 cases pending before just one judge. As for
justice, people are disgusted with notorious criminals going free
on bond.''
   ``They worry about the slow pace of the judicial process, the
lack of prosecution of embezzlers and torturers and that, because
of bungled prosecutions, the courts have had to free some people,''
he said in a statement.
   His remarks were published by the Civic Crusade, an organization
of business and professional people that led the Panamanian
opposition to Noriega.
   Some officials of the Noriega regime face specific charges of
torture, but the public prosecutor's office has not said how many.
They include Felipe Camargo, accused of torturing Crusade members.
   Military officers involved in unsuccessful coups against Noriega
have said they and other conspirators also were tortured.
   The Civic Crusade declared: ``It is the responsibility of the
attorney general and the prosecutors that the cases they bring .. .
be careful and complete and meet legal requirements to avoid having
them dismissed for lack of evidence or for defects.''
   Molina Mola claimed the government of Guillermo Endara, which
took over after the invasion, was allowing cronies of Noriega to go
free pending trial. The general is in the United States, facing
charges of drug trafficking.
   Ricardo Bermudez, a Crusade official, said: ``The justice system
is the first national emergency the government should attend to. We
are aimlessly turning criminals free, something that unnerves and
angers people.
   ``If this continues, the democratic longings Panamanians fought
so long for could be in danger because the will of the people will
not be met.''
   Former chief justice Vasquez, who supported Noriega's Democratic
Revolutionary Party, said in an interview: ``In criminal justice,
processes are slow. Justice has been interrupted. Judicial terms
were interrupted from Dec. 21, 1989 (when the invasion began) until
Jan. 29, 1990.''
   ``The attitude of the prosecutors hasn't changed. They were on
the take from the military and they are on the take from the people
in office now,'' he said, referring to former supporters of Noriega
who still are in the government and hope to avoid being charged.
   Eusebio Marchosky, in charge of recovering state property stolen
by Noriega and his followers, has claimed publicly his
investigations were being undermined by officials still still loyal
to the ousted genral.
   ``There is interference in the investigations, attacks on
depositories of goods considered to be ill-gotten, and there are
political and economic links to the deposed Gen. Manuel Noriega,''
he said.
   Marchosky added that investigations were hampered by lack of
evidence and ``the Americans still have 15,000 boxes of judicial
documents.''
   Return of the documents is one of several matters being
discussed by the United States and Panama.
   The United States seized tons of documents during the invasion,
hoping they would help track Noriega's alleged involvement in
narcotics trafficking.
   What seems to worry Panamanians most, as revealed by letters to
editors and comments on call-in radio shows, is balancing justice
with the need to reunite the country.
   In suggesting solutions, Vasquez mentioned expelling offenders
for a time, ``because a politician in exile is harmless,'' a
practice followed in Brazil; the total amnesty Nicaragua used to
bring Contra rebels back into society, or the Colombian method of
collaboration among political groups.
   His own solution, Vasquez said, would be to separate the
handling of serious and lesser crimes, ``ease tensions and bring

<HEAD>In India, There's a TV Epic to End All TV Epics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAJU GOPALAKRISHNAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the United States, ``War and
Remembrance'' lasted 39{ hours and was considered one of the
longest miniseries ever. But how about one lasting more than 18
months?
   There is such a maxiseries. It's called ``The Mahabharata,'' and
it's still running on Indian television. It won't end until July 8.
   Based on a mythological Hindu epic that is the longest poem in
world literature, ``The Mahabharata'' is the country's hottest
show, even though it airs at an hour that would amaze U.S. networks.
   Each one-hour episode of the Indian drama starts at 9 a.m. on
Sundays.
   Despite that early hour, Doordarshan, the government department
that controls India's only nationwide TV channel, estimates the
show attracts an average audience of 90 million people each week _
or more than one-tenth of India's population of 880 million.
   The serial is in the Hindi language, but Doordarshan officials
say its appeal reaches far beyond the northern, Hindi-speaking
regions of the country.
   In the southern state of Kerala, for example, newspapers publish
a transcript of each week's show in Malayalam, the local language.
   ``People here are highly involved in `The Mahabharata,' '' says
I.G. Venugopal, a resident of Trivandrum, the capital of Kerala.
``They read the newspaper to get to know the outline and then watch
the serial.''
   ``The Mahabharata'' also appears to have transcended religious
barriers in India, where 82 percent of the people are Hindu but
there are large communities of Moslems, Sikhs and Christians.
   In one New Delhi house, two Moslem carpenters installing new
windows threatened to take Sunday off unless they were given access
to the television set.
   ``I watch the serial every week. If I miss an episode now, I
won't understand anything,'' said one of them, Naseem Ahmed.
   His remarks would be familiar to American viewers of ABC's
surreal, convoluted ``Twin Peaks.''
   That series is set in a small logging town in the Pacific
Northwest.
   ``The Mahabharata'' has a somewhat wider scope. It's a
kaleidoscope of court intrigue and fierce battles between two sets
of feuding brothers, tempered with religion, philosophy and the
virtues and vices of princes and aspiring kings.
   Many Hindus learn the story in their childhood, when it is
re-told as the victory of good over evil with the five good Pandava
brothers defeating the 100 bad Kaurava brothers.
   But now, as the show begins to peak (the 99th Kaurava brother
recently was killed in battle), several twists and nuances are
beginning to come through. The Pandavas aren't pure: They have used
every trick in the book to win.
   And some on the Kaurava side aren't totally bad. Their army
chief, the illegitimate son of the mother of the Pandavas, is
chivalrous in battle. And the guru of the Pandavas, another good
guy, was on the Kaurava side until he died.
   ``Most of this we didn't know,'' says Shailendra Chopra, an
employee of Indian Airlines and another avid viewer. ``It's like a
crime thriller. What will happen next?''
   ``It will take a long time for us to get another serial like
this,'' said Abdul Sattar Tatari, the Doordarshan official in
charge of television programs. ``Both in terms of audience appeal
and revenue.''
   Doordarshan plans to bring out a serial on Indian war heroes in
the ``Mahabharata'' slot after the current epic ends next month,
Tatari said.
   ``It definitely won't be as popular,'' he said. ``People seem to
prefer going back to mythological serials, and we are also trying
to get one of those for telecast within a few months.''
   ``I have to feed my kids in front of the television set on
Sundays,'' grumbled Gurmeet Kaur, a New Delhi housewife. When told
of the program that will replace ``The Mahabharata'' next month,
she said she doubted things would improve at home.
   ``War heroes?'' she said. ``I guess it's back to eating
breakfast at the dining table.''

<HEAD>Politicians Read Different Signals in California Tax Approval</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Looking for omens in California's vote to
increase the state gasoline tax, politicians in both parties are
reading the signals that suit them. They aren't checking the fine
print, though.
   The administration sees the referendum vote for higher gasoline
taxes as proof that President Bush's national transportation policy
took the right route in recommending that state and local
governments pay a bigger share of the cost of rebuilding roads,
bridges and other facilities.
   Democrats, who had criticized that approach, said Californians
showed that people are willing to accept higher taxes, so long as
they know in advance that the money will be spent on real needs,
and won't be wasted.
   That argument could be tailored to fit demands that the
president renounce his campaign vow to block any new taxes, and
tell the voters that it has to be done to deal with the budget
deficit.
   An increase in the federal gasoline tax is among the options
that budget negotiators are likely to consider. Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, proposed boosting it sharply to help balance the budget
and at the same time reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil.
   But deficit reduction is a general goal, not a specific one like
the highways and bridges that are to be rebuilt with the proceeds
of the California gas tax boost.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said that if the
federal gas tax were to be increased from the current 9 cents a
gallon _ a step he carefully avoided endorsing _ the money should
be earmarked for the transportation infrastructure and nothing else.
   Skinner said the June 5 vote in California shows that state and
local governments are willing to take on a greater share of
transportation costs, and that the voters will back them, so long
as new tax revenues are used for that specific purpose.
   He said people distrust the way governments spend money, but are
less reluctant to accept tax increases when they know exactly how
the revenues will be used.
   ``I think it validates one of the principles that has been
somewhat contentious,'' Skinner said.
   ``It's time to act,'' Bush had said in presenting the
transportation plan earlier this year, and promising the states
more flexibility in the use of less federal aid. At the time,
critics in both parties said it set national goals and assumed the
states would pay the bill. ``Read my lips; raise your taxes,'' said
Gov. James R. Thompson Jr. of Illinois, a Republican.
   Skinner said the states should be increasing their
transportation taxes, that 18 have done so in the past year and 33
in the past two years.
   Until the voters agreed to raise the California gas tax from 9
cents to 18 cents a gallon over the next five years, the rate there
had been held at bargain level. The California tax had been
increased only 2 cents a gallon since 1963.
   While there is a tendency to look at the California vote as
another bellwether from the state that began the tax revolt a dozen
years ago, this time the message may be that there is none.
   The political circumstances are not going to be matched
elsewhere.
   After an intensive campaign for the measure, the voters agreed
by a relatively narrow margin to ease a state spending ceiling
dating from the tax revolt, and to begin phasing in the gasoline
tax boost.
   According to the National Journal, California ranks last among
the states in per capita spending on transportation. Its gasoline
tax was the fourth lowest in the country; the national average is
16.3 cents a gallon. Even with the increase, the tax won't pass the
current national average for three years.
   Republican Gov. George Deukmejian and state Democratic leaders
joined in support of the measure. So did interest groups, business
to labor, unlikely allies, unanimous this time. About $6 million
was spent to support the measure, in a campaign with no major,
organized opposition.
   The freeway casualties of the October 1989 earthquake, and
chronic gridlock on urban highways served to dramatize the problem.
The revenues are tightly earmarked: $15.5 billion to build and
improve freeways over the next decade.
   For all that, the referendum was approved with only 52 percent
of the vote in a low-turnout primary election.
   ``The only significance I see is that Californians were smarter
than I thought they were,'' said Sen. Warren B. Rudman, R-N.H. He
said there was no national message in a state decision that higher
gas taxes were preferable to hours-long traffic jams.

<HEAD>Big Trend on Campus _ Coping With Rape</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KILEY ARMSTRONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's colleges, increasingly concerned about
gang and acquaintance rape, are starting to teach students a more
elemental lesson than English lit and Geology 101: that it takes
two to say ``yes'' to sex.
   At campuses around the country, schools are sponsoring hotlines,
courses and workshops to counter the widespread conviction that
when it comes to sex, it's every man for himself.
   Many campus males feel ``you should always be ready to have sex,
even if you don't want to,'' says Toby Simon, assistant dean of
student life at Brown University. ``Don't ask a woman how far you
can go _ just start making moves.''
   Four years ago, Simon surveyed students to learn if they'd ever
had sex against another person's will. Ten percent of the men _ at
a school where students ``have a tendency to be politically
correct'' _ admitted they had.
   ``That, to me, was a real trigger that we had to do something,''
said Simon, who also is director of health education.
   At the time, few schools admitted a problem existed. But Simon's
efforts put Brown in the forefront of sex crime education.
   Now, slowly, other schools are following that lead and, as
awareness grows, it appears more victims are coming forward _ and
are being taken seriously.
   Bernice Sandler, director of the Association of American
Colleges' Project on the Status of Women, has documented about 100
campus gang rapes nationwide over the past five years.
   ``For every one that's publicized, there must be easily more
than a hundred that are not publicized,'' said Sandler. ``I've
asked students, `Does this happen on your campus?' and I'm told,
`Just about every week.'''
   Rape by solitary acquaintances also is common. Studies show 15
percent to 25 percent of all women undergraduates have been
physically or psychologically intimidated into having sex against
their will, Sandler said.
   ``I don't know if many more instances are occurring now than 20
years ago. It's just that the females are more willing and capable
of speaking out and bringing charges _ which I think is good,''
said Durward Owen, executive director of the Pi Kappa Phi
fraternity, headquartered in Charlotte, N.C.
   Pi Kappa Phi, which has 6,500 members at 142 colleges and
universities, voted six years ago to take a stand against sexual
abuse. Owen said a growing number of fraternities have begun
discussing the problem in the past two years.
   ``We noticed so many instances of athletic team rapes and dorm
rapes and date rapes being reported,'' he said. ``It appeared that
many times, these things had gone on in the past and were accepted
at face value.''
   Pi Kappa Phi mails literature to its chapters and examines the
issue at regional meetings. Its chapters often offer seminars with
other campus groups.
   Colleges are taking many other tacks:
   _At Brown, victims can count on a campuswide help network,
including 24-hour-a-day telephone counseling.
   Simon works to prevent both assaults and ``sexual misadventures:
bad results that occur because people do not know how to talk about
sex, because they do not make their needs known, and because they
drink too much.''
   Simon repeats the message at freshmen orientation and in a
sexuality course. She addresses student groups, including
fraternities, ``in extremely candid, graphic ways, using students
to do role playing, using students' language.''
   _In 1984, two women at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania told a
dormitory assistant that they had been abused by acquaintances. In
response, students produced a consciousness-raising video to be
shown to freshmen in dorms. Discussions follow.
   Since the tape was produced, Swarthmore has sold about 100
copies to other schools and organizations.
   _Awareness was heightened at the University of
California-Berkeley in 1986 after a student said she was raped by
four ootball players in a dormitory.
   No charges were filed and the football players were not
suspended, but they were forced to move out of the dorm, do 100
hours of community service and write apologies to the woman, said
university spokeswoman Pat McBroom.
   Amid the resulting uproar, a faculty-student task force
investigated women's safety and the campus climate. In January
1987, Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman sent a letter to some 30,000
students, condemning sexual abuse and noting that ``No means no.''
Now, rape prevention workshops are held for various campus groups.
   There are indications that other schools will be following in
the footsteps of Brown, Swarthmore and Berkeley. The Association of
American Colleges has issued about 100 recommendations to its
members on how to prevent rape, respond to victims and discipline
rapists.
   In 1987, California's Legislature voted to suggest that the
state's colleges and universities adopt codes prohibiting rape and
setting penalties, including suspension or expulsion on conviction.
The resolution also suggests rape prevention seminars for freshmen,
fraternities and sororities.
   Building on the resolution, California Assemblywoman Lucille
Roybal-Allard has introduced a bill requiring essentially all
colleges and universities to follow specific procedures in the
event of sexual abuse, including calling the police when the victim
allows it.
   In New York, a report of the governor's Task Force on Rape and
Sexual Assault has recommended the State University of New York and
City University of New York develop strong prevention programs.
   ``Campus-based surveys have indicated that many students lack an
understanding of, or deny, what constitutes a rape,'' said the
report.
   Ignorance is only one aspect of the problem; mob psychology,
peer pressure and alcohol abuse also contribute.
   Sandler, of the Association of American Colleges, said most gang
rapists are fraternity brothers or team athletes.
   ``Very often, these men are simply raping for each other,'' she
said. ``They'll do something they might not do if they were by
themselves.''
   Women who report campus attacks often are harassed by the
rapists and their friends, Sandler said. Many drop out or switch
schools after their attackers start using sexual slurs or other
intimidation tactics.
   Shawn Johnston, a forensic psychologist at the University of
California-Davis who treats sex offenders, said there are times,
such as when alcohol is involved, when ``the line that
differentiates the consensual, or voluntary, from a forcible act is
fairly thin.'' That, say women's advocates, contributes to a
``blame the victim'' attitude, even by the victim herself.
   ``I don't care if a woman walks into the room raving drunk and
stark naked: it's not an excuse to be raped,'' said Claire Kaplan,
executive director of the Washington-based National Coalition
Against Sexual Assault.
   Brown's Simon agrees, but still urges caution. She says booze
can lead men to ``push themselves on women, misread the cues
they're getting from a potential partner.'' Then, an inebriated
woman might not be able to fight off an attacker.
   ``This attitude exists with men: `Give them enough to drink and
they'll be easy,''' she said. ``I've had men tell me, `If she
passes out, then we have sex, is that rape?' I say to these men,
`What kind of a lover are you? Sex is something that happens with
two alert, conscious people.'''
   Owen, of Pi Kappa Phi, said it took about 30 years to reach the
``obsession with alcohol'' that often triggers campus rapes.
   ``We can't do all that much to make it turn around in hurry,''
he said. ``But I think an amazing turnaround is starting to occur.''

<HEAD>Odds Get Tougher For Stock Investors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After the stock market bonanza of the 1980s,
many savers and investors seem bound and determined not to miss out
on the promise of the 1990s.
   In particular, they have been pouring money into stock mutual
funds, both on their own and through retirement programs such as
company-sponsored 401(k) savings plans.
   Their inspiration comes from many sources: the apparent end of
the Cold War and the perceived triumph of capitalism over communism
in many parts of the world; opportunities in fields like health
care, technology and the environment; and, not so coincidentally,
the recent rise of the U.S. stock market itself to record highs.
   Much of this optimism may prove justified, says a financial
advisory firm long known as a staunch advocate of investing in
stocks.
   But it also cautions that anyone hoping for a replay of the '80s
in the next decade is bucking some long statistical odds.
   ``We are not doom and gloomers,'' says Norman Fosback at the
Institute for Econometric Research, publisher of a series of
newsletters on investing. But the percentage returns from stocks in
the '90s, he declares, ``will almost certainly fall far short of
those earned in the 1980s.''
   While there are no absolute limits on the gains stocks can
achieve, Fosback observes, ``there are a few constants'' that can
be used in assessing their possibilities and probabilities.
   For starters, he notes, the 500 stocks that make up Standard &amp;
Poor's composite index produced a total return _ appreciation plus
dividends _ in the 1980s at an average compound annual rate of
about 18 percent.
   That ranks far above the historical trend rate, after all the
booms and busts are figured together, of about 10 percent.
   Stocks and the economy, furthermore, began the 1980s at a very
low point _ which Fosback says effectively magnified the
opportunities for gains.
   In financial matters, he says, ``when there is a lot of room for
improvement, and little room for further discouragement, the path
of least resistance is to the upside.''
   When Wall Street's bull market began in 1982, the stock of a
typical company sold at a price about seven times its annual
earnings. Today price-earnings ratios are more than double that, in
the neighborhood of 15 to 1 or 16 to 1.
   For another doubling of P-Es to occur in the '90s, Fosback
notes, they would have to soar to their highest levels in history.
   Similarly, he argues, there is less room for growth in business
activity and corporate earnings with an unemployment rate around 5
percent starting the 1990s than there was in the early 1980s, when
unemployment stood near 11 percent.
   ``It is likely that unemployment is already close to its lowest
possible level right now,'' he says.
   ``This means that real national growth will probably increase 3
percent or less per annum in the 1990s, not the 4 percent-plus
rates of the last eight years.
   ``Irrespective of political, social and economic forces,
investors will probably earn a much lower return in the 1990s than
the 18 percent per-annum total return recorded in the 1980s,''
Fosback concludes.
   ``Does all this mean that the Dow can't reach 3,000, 3,600 or
5,000? Of course not. At some point during the decade, the market
will probably again sell at 20 times earnings.
   ``What our analysis does indicate is that long-term buy and hold
investors will not find the stock market to be the sure thing that
it was in the 1980s.''

<HEAD>The Return To Long-Term Goals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From time to time the economy goes through a
phase in which long-term goals are abandoned, fundamentals are
forgotten and only the next hour, day or week seems to count.
   The economy becomes volatile, stock prices gyrate, inflation
erupts, quick killings are sought and often achieved in real estate
and securities, get-rich-quick schemes abound and corporations
wheel and deal.
   And then it all evaporates, although not until warning signs and
omens _ bankruptcies, scandals, prosecutions _ become too numerous
to ignore. The old ways come back. Basics are rediscovered; the
vision is again long term.
   Like now.
   These phases of the cycle are never so sharply defined that they
produce headlines; there are always frayed edges and exceptions to
the generality, but still the pattern can be discerned:
   On Wall Street, for example, where analysts now talk about a
company's price-to-earnings ratio rather than the possibility that
it might be taken over by a larger company, with a sudden and
spectacular rise in price.
   In the housing markets, where prices are more sensible than they
were a year ago and where the buyer now buys a house as a place in
which to live rather than a place in which to invest money for a
big return.
   In corporations, where managers are fed up with the destructive
practice of draining ever-higher short-term profits by refusing to
``waste'' money on research and capital improvements that make for
a stronger future.
   And where boards of directors are withdrawing those management
incentives tied to short-term profits and demanding instead that
companies be made more competitive in the global marketplace.
   At the Federal Reserve, where economic manipulation is in
disfavor and the goal now is to achieve modest, long-term economic
stability, even if it means walking a tightrope over the chasm of
recession before that goal is achieved.
   In organized labor, where workers join management to raise
corporate productivity even if it means forgoing big wage
increases, the notion being that a stronger company conveys greater
long-term benefits.
   In consumer markets, where people have begun curtailing their
propensity to borrow as if there were no tomorrow and are tending
to save a bit more, forgoing purchases that once were almost
automatic.
   These patterns can be discerned over varying lengths of time,
and sometimes patterns of calm and then excitement occur within
larger patterns. But in the marketplace, the past two decades
certainly qualify as a period of volatility.
   The stock market erupted time after time, then collapsed in cold
ashes. Rumors pervaded the market, and every day stocks with a
story were promoted _ takeovers, buyouts, new products _ or demoted
when they fell into debt.
   Fundamental analysis often was ignored; in the new marketplace
there was no time for such things. Why settle for 7 percent annual
dividends when you might make that in a day on price appreciation?
   Volatility and change invite creativity, new ways of doing
things, short cuts: junk bonds, trading shenanigans, computer
manipulations, tax-avoidance schemes. A new immorality arises _
until the culprits are caught.
   Enough of these culprits have been caught in the past couple of
years to suggest that the easy way, the short-cut route, doesn't
pay, either on Wall Street or in corporate management or among
consumers.
   Indicative of this is an announcement from a large benefits
consulting firm after it polled corporations on the types of
incentives they were offering. It offered this report:
   ``Long-term incentive plans may be the way of the future,
according to a recent survey. ...
   ``Findings revealed 28 percent of participating companies
offered long-term incentive plans to executives in 1985, while 40
percent plan to offer such programs by 1995.''
   Just as it used to be, back before all the short-term business
began.

   It's fitting the little statue labeled St.
``Expedite'' should end up at Our Lady of Guadeloupe. The old Roman
Catholic church on the edge of the French Quarter with its shrine
to St. Jude has long been a haven to the homeless, the helpless and
many of life's misfits.
   On a bright spring morning a young man kneels in prayer at the
altar, an elderly woman lights a candle at the statue of St. Jude,
and an old man in ragged clothes sits in a patch of sunlight by the
door, his shopping bags around his feet.
   ``People come here from all over the city, but we have a lot of
people who come from the French Quarter and here on Rampart Street
and from the Iberville housing project directly behind us,'' said
the Rev. William Zapalac, who has been at the church eight years.
``We see a lot of life in this location. Things are always
hopping.''
   Called the Mortuary Chapel for many years, the church was built
in 1826 to handle the funerals of victims of the an outbreak of
yellow fever.
   ``In those days they thought it was spread by the dead so they
didn't want to have them in the Quarter,'' said Millie Brown, an
80-year-old parishoner. ``They'd bring them here and then zip them
right across the street to the cemetery. They say there would be
hundreds of wagons with coffins lined up on them outside the
church.''
   St. ``Expedite'' showed up about the turn of the century. Legend
has it the statue arrived at the docks without paperwork or address.
   ``The only thing they saw was the word `Expedite' on the side of
the crate,'' said Tom Finney, spokesman for the New Orleans
Diocese. ``In those days there were a lot of first-generation
Italians and Irish on the New Orleans docks and they didn't read
English very well. They thought `Expedite' was the name of a saint
so they delivered the statute to the church.''
   Today it stands by the door, a cross in one hand and a sheaf of
wheat in the other. The name on the statue is in quotes, St.
``Expedite.''
   ``There really is a St. Expedite. I don't know if this is him or
not, but he fits in here, anyway,'' said Zapalac.
   Four times a year the little church is host for a nine-day St.
Jude Novena that draws 3,000 to 4,000 people a day. St. Jude, the
patron saint of lost causes, spends the rest of the year dealing
with a variety of people and pleas from the local community. There
is no lack of work, Zapalac said.
   ``Being right here by the French Quarter we get a lot of the
more unusual people from there. In New Orleans, I find people are
much more tolerant of unusual people. Some places, people would be
afraid of many of the people we really enjoy here,'' the priest
said.
   Rampart Street, with its seedy hotels and cheap bars, has become
a mecca for the homeless, Zapalac said.
   ``We're seeing more and more homeless people all the time. Some
of them we get to know very well,'' he said.
   Some of them, like a mother and daughter who lived on the
streets, are puzzles without solutions, he said.
   The church found housing several times for the mother, who was
in her 50s, and her daughter, in her 30s, but they always returned
to the streets, Zapalac said.
   ``I don't know what happened to them. They finally disappeared.
I think they were afraid of being trapped somehow if they stayed in
the housing we found for them,'' he said.
   Iberville, a vast collection of decaying brick buildings, is
home for many of the city's poor, including many of the church's
parishioners.
   But on Saturday nights it's not problems that are the focus of
the early Mass, it's the city and its music that come to the
forefront in the church's Jazz Mass. The Jazz Mass is the only one
in the world, Zapalac believes.
   ``There's always piano and organ and drums and trumpet and
sometimes other instruments, depending on who's here,'' he said.
``It's really something when we get going.''

   The world's Christian population grew by
about 326 million during the past decade to an estimated 1.75
billion, an expert on religious statistics says.
   The Rev. David Barrett, an Anglican priest, editor of the World
Christian Encyclopedia and now a consultant to the Southern Baptist
Foreign Mission Board, cited the figures in the International
Bulletin of Missionary Research.
   The new total amounts to about 33 percent of the world's 5.3
billion people. It includes 963 million Roman Catholics, 324
million Protestants, 180 million Eastern Orthodox and 54 million
Anglicans, the ecumenical fortnightly Christianity Today reports.
   An additional 232 million Christians were not included in those
groupings.

   In demonstrations in Raleigh and Atlanta, a statement by
Episcopal Presiding Bishop Edmond L. Browning was read, calling the
death penalty ``an affront to God'' because all people are made in
God's image.
   ``The taking of human life diminishes us as a people,'' because

<HEAD>Sununu's Influence Still Felt Back in New Hampshire</HEAD>

   John Sununu wields his clout in Washington
these days but his influence still is felt in the state he governed
for six years before being tapped as George Bush's chief of staff.
   New Hampshire's immediate past governor is seen as a smooth
operator who does favors for his adopted home state but leaves few
political fingerprints.
   Some state Republicans express concern that Sununu is meddling
in local politics, but most consider his presence in the White
House to be an asset for the state.
   ``Sununu makes certain New Hampshire's place on the political
map is not forgotten,'' said GOP strategist Tom Rath.
   ``It was not an accident that the first place outside of
Washington that the president visited was New Hampshire,'' Rath
said, referring to a Bush stopover in Manchester not long after he
became president.
   As New Hampshire's governor, Sununu sided early with Bush in the
1988 presidential race. He helped engineer a Bush victory in the
state's earliest-in-the-nation primary and continued the national
campaign with attacks against Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis,
governor of neighboring Massachusetts.
   Sununu's political work continues even now. He had a guiding
role in easing the White House's hands-off policy toward party
primaries, putting the Oval Office behind candidates such as Rep.
Bob Smith, R-N.H., who hopes to replace retiring GOP Sen. Gordon
Humphrey.
   State GOP chairwoman Rhona Charbonneau wishes Sununu had stayed
out of the primary race between Smith and Rye lawyer Tom Christo.
   ``It's good to have a friend in the White House rather than a
foe,'' she said. ``But I truly wish they had kept out of the
primary. I don't believe anybody, not even the White House, should
be involved.''
   Sununu, whose influence also can be seen in some state races,
brushes off the criticism.
   ``We're not trying to pick candidates,'' he says. ``We're trying
to help the process.''
   His wife, Nancy, hasn't kept silent either. She said she
considered challenging U.S. Rep. Chuck Douglas for the GOP
nomination in New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district because
she ``never appreciated his values and his morals.''
   Sununu and his successor in the governor's mansion, Republican
Judd Gregg, have what insiders consider a civil relationship at
best. At a recent New Hampshire business dinner, Sununu sat next to
Senate President William Bartlett, who was considering challenging
Gregg.
   Sununu, 50, is described as Bush's right-hand man, part of a
White House troika with Secretary of State James Baker and budget
director Richard Darman.
   Many doubted the abrasive Sununu would last long in the White
House job after an admittedly rocky start. But now even his critics
have had to admit he appears to be effective and may wield more
power than any other recent chief of staff.
   Most Republican politicians believe it is to New Hampshire's
advantage to have Sununu in the White House.
   ``We may not get everything from the White House, but people at
the White House have the ear of New Hampshire,'' said Bill Zeliff,
a Sununu ally who is seeking the GOP nomination for Smith's
congressional seat.
   Sununu is seen as helping to place New Hampshire operatives in
federal positions, promoting the Seabrook nuclear power plant and
ensuring that important promises are fulfilled.
   When the Navy threatened 1,000 jobs by canceling a $128 million
submarine overhaul at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Maine and New
Hampshire governors and congressional delegations won a pledge by
the Navy to find replacement work.
   Humphrey credits Sununu with making the Navy deliver.
   ``When those promises started to filter down, the Navy
bureaucracy was sidestepping it, so I called Sununu and he got them
to do what they said they would do,'' Humphrey recalls.
   Humphrey said Sununu is clearing similar hurdles for a proposal
the senator is championing to make a wildlife refuge out of some of
the land to be abandoned when Pease Air Force Base closes.
   A string of people with New Hampshire connections have been
appointed to federal posts since Sununu moved to Washington. Most
recently, Wally Stickney, a Sununu friend and associate, was
selected to head the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   A highly placed Republican, who agreed to discuss Sununu only if
not quoted by name, said Sununu is adept at maintaining a low
profile in the state.
   ``He hasn't left any fingerprints or left anyone with a story
that they can tell that `Sununu sidled up to me, and so on.'''
   Seabrook, the Republican said, falls into that category. Sununu,
champion of the nuclear power plant when he was governor, ``didn't
just go to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and say, `Give them
the license,''' the source said.
   ``He's been very cautious. But Seabrook got the license, didn't
it? He made sure his feelings on the topic were well known in the
appropriate places.''
   Sununu plays down his role in the licensing of Seabrook.
   ``I was a patient man,'' he said recently. ``I knew the right
thing would happen.''

<HEAD>Islamic Fundamentalists Gain Influence in Jordan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EFTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attacks by Sunni Moslem zealots on banks,
breweries and night clubs underline the growing influence of
Islamic fundamentalists in one of the most secular Arab states.
   In May, an Islamic court convicted journalist Ibrahim Abu Naab,
59, of apostasy, or abandoning Islam, and ruled that he be divorced
from his wife and separated from his children.
   Abdullah Shamayleh, prosecutor-general of the Islamic Court,
urged it during Abu Naab's trial to permit ``the shedding of his
blood.''
   That would not appear necessary, since anyone who kills an
apostate is immune from prosecution under Islamic law.
   Jordan's civil law does not grant immunity, however, and the
civil appeals court probably will overrule the Islamic tribunal's
verdict.
   The ``crime'' Abu Naab committed was attending a meeting in
Britain of the breakaway Qadiani sect, which is outlawed in many
Moslem states, and allegedly converting from the mainstream Sunni
sect.
   His case reflects the increasing strength of fundamentalists,
who became the largest legislative bloc after the November
parliamentary elections, Jordan's first in 22 years. The Moslem
Brotherhood won 22 of the 80 seats and Islamic independents got 12.
   They have pledged to work for strict application of Sharia, the
Islamic religious law, but have said they will work within the
constitution and not challenge King Hussein.
   Arab leaders worry about increasing fundamentalism among the
world's 1 billion Moslems. Recent moves toward greater democracy in
some Arab states are largely an outgrowth of that concern.
   Khalil Abdulrahman Khalifa, a 28-year-old engineer, said: ``The
Islamic tide is growing these days because the people have lost
trust in their governments, which have not moved so far to solve
the central Arab issue, the Palestinian problem.
   ``We want liberation and we want to have an effective role in
the world. We want the Arabs to be respected, not ignored. The
Islamic parties attract us because they match our outlook.''
   Jordan's fundamentalists are not having it all their own way. A
government ban on male hairdressers working in women's beauty
salons, imposed in May because of Islamic pressure, was canceled in
two weeks after strong public protest.
   The fundamentalists sought to enforce a Koranic law that a woman
cannot be touched by a man who is not her husband or a relative.
   Even though the fundamentalists ultimately lost, many Jordanians
are disturbed about the government of Prime Minister Mudar Badran
bowing to the pressure in the first place.
   When the prohibition was imposed, the English-language Jordan
Times declared: ``It is clear that such a ban will lead to other
decisions that will limit the freedom of the individual.''
   It said the sole purpose was ``to cater to the whims of some
religious or conservative groups which do not represent the
majority of the population.''
   During street protests in May, after an Israeli civilian killed
Palestinian workers in Israel, fundamentalists attacked businesses
considered un-Islamic.
   Mobs raided banks, the Dutch-owned Amstel brewery and night
clubs that serve liquor, causing damage worth millions of dollars.
Charging interest and drinking alcohol are forbidden by the Koran,
the Moslem holy book.
   Several Amman night clubs were attacked in February and March.
   State television has been affected. Scenes of actors kissing, or
even holding hands, are deleted because the fundamentalists
consider them lewd.
   Newspaper or poster advertisements showing scantily clad women
have disappeared.
   Attendance at prayers on Friday, the Moslem sabbath, has grown
considerably.
   The area covered by prayer rugs on the sidewalks around Amman's
Husseini Mosque in the teeming bazaar district has been extended to
accomodate more people.
   Fundamentalist strength is on the rise in the Israeli-occupied
territories across the Jordan River, challenging the Palestine
Liberation Organization. A movement called Hamas, or Zeal, has
played a major role in the 30-month-old Palestinian uprising and
made major gains in municipal elections in Israel's Arab towns.
   In Egypt, Moslem militants have attacked Christian churches and,
in clashes with police this year, 34 people have been killed and
more than 70 wounded. Fundamentalism is spreading in Tunisia.
   In Turkey, Moslem but secular, fundamentalist violence is
increasing and several outspoken champions of secularism have been
assassinated.
   Earlier this year, the Turkish government was forced to lift a
rule against women university students wearing Islamic-style
headscarves on campus.

<HEAD>Brazilian Spy Agency Still Active Despite President's Pledge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A secret security agency created by the
military regime still operates five years after the generals
relinquished power to civilians, despite the new president's pledge
to abolish it.
   The National Intelligence Service, a sort of combined FBI and
CIA, was synonymous with spying, torture, censorship and midnight
knocks on the door under the military governments of 1964-1985.
   Its decline accelerated when agents were linked to terrorist
bombings carried out in an attempt to forestall a return to
democracy.
   When President Fernando Collor de Mello took office Mar. 15, he
promised to dismantle the hated agency, known as the SNI, and burn
its secret files.
   ``The security of the state cannot become the insecurity of the
citizen,'' said Collor, who won Brazil's first direct election for
president since 1960.
   He gave the agency a new name _ the Secretariat of Strategic
Affairs _ and a new civilian director, but critics say it still
collects information about citizens despite laws prohibiting it
from doing so.
   ``In place of the SNI, the government created the embryo of a
political police,'' said Walder de Goes, a political science
professor at the University of Brasilia and an expert on the agency.
   ``The ideological archives were joined with financial
information about individuals and their police records. Anywhere in
the world, that's the beginning of a political police.''
   Luis Eduardo Greenhalgh, a lawyer who represented political
prisoners during military rule, said: ``The SNI was not
extinguished, just modified. Some of its agents were returned to
their military units, but most are still spying.
   ``If the government needs dirt on somebody, the agency gets it.
Everything continues the same.''
   In 1965, the SNI was created as a super-intelligence service to
safeguard national security. It spied on citizens, tapped
telephones and tailed alleged leftist opponents of the regime.
   As repression increased in the 1960s and early 1970s, the agency
ran covert operations and collected damaging information about
enemies of the ruling generals.
   Thousands of Brazilians lost their jobs, were imprisoned or had
to flee the country because their names apeareed on the SNI list.
   The impunity enjoyed by SNI agents created disciplinary problems
within the armed forces, and Gen. Golbery do Couto e Silva, who
formed the agency and was its first director, said at one point:
``I created a monster.''
   Brazil returned to civilian rule in 1985, But President Jose
Sarney, chosen by an electoral college under military control, did
not try to curb the armed forces' behind-the-scenes influence.
   Collor promised a change.
   During the 1989 campaign, the 40-year-old presidential candidate
referred to the agency's director as a ``tin-pot general.'' The job
job was a cabinet-level post.
   Once in office, Collor decreed the SNI abolished. Clandestine
operations would cease, he said, SNI agents would return to the
regular military and secret archives would be opened to the public
and destroyed
   To replace ``the service,'' as insiders called it, Collor
created the Secretariat of Strategic Affairs and turned it over to
Pedro Paulo Leoni Ramos, a 30-year-old businessman and longtime
friend.
   Its job was ``exclusively'' to provide the president with
information for political and government policy, according to the
official orders.
   The old agency did not die, however. Its files were not
destroyed, and even grew fatter with data from the Federal Police
and the Internal Revenue Service.
   Goes said the new Secretariat is more sophisticated than the SNI
ever was.
   ``Information and intelligence now are a department of the
Secretariat and continue under the aegis of the military,'' he
said. The other departments of the new agency are Strategic Policy
and National Defense.
   ``If a crisis were to develop, there are now authorities who
could act like a secret police,'' Goes said.
   He complained of a lack of outside control over the agency,
noting ``there is no congressional committee that checks its budget
or personnel.''
   Like his military predecessors at the SNI, director Ramos is
highly secretive.
   He will not speak to the press and is rarely photographed or
seen in public. Several requests by The Associated Press for an
interview went unanswered.
   ``The job creates the habit,'' said Goes, who knows Ramos and
described him as ``a very capable young man, in Collor's strictest
confidence and one of the few with direct access to the president's
office.''
   In recent years, former members of the SNI have revealed some of
the agency's inner workings and past mistakes.
   Retired Gen. Helio Lemos, 74, a former top official, said: ``The
SNI had informants in every Brazilian embassy and consulate, but it
still didn't even suspect that Argentina would invade the Falkland
Islands in 1982.''
   Lemos said the SNI did not foresee the oil crises of the 1970s
or the Iran-Iraq war, both of which were of great strategic
importance to Brazil, an importer of oil and exporter of arms.
   Adm. Maximiano da Fonseca, a former navy minister, recalled that
``we got our information from the newspapers.''
   Some generals have grumbled publicly about Collor's decision to
put a civilian in charge, but Goes said the armed forces and
Secretariat now make up a new intelligence network.
   ``The military was worried at first,'' he said, ``but soon the
spy services of the army, navy and air force were expanded and many
files were duplicated, in the event of possible destruction.''
   He described the combined network as ``a web so tangled that
nothing and nobody can escape.''

<HEAD>A Home for the Big Broadway Musical in the New Jersey Suburbs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In the sprawling suburbia of New Jersey,
nearly an hour's drive from Times Square, the big Broadway-style
musical is alive and flourishing.
   It has found a receptive home at the Paper Mill Playhouse, a
one-time summer theater that forsakes conventional straw-hat
offerings for more innovative theater fare, produced on a yearly
budget that now tops $10 million.
   The Paper Mill's prominence has risen steadily in the last few
years, primarily because of its savvy mixture of musicals, both old
and new. Among its productions were a revival of ``Mack and
Mabel,'' a rarely seen Jerry Herman musical about movie director
Mack Sennett and his star Mabel Norman, and a musical version of
James Michener's ``Sayonara.''
   But the show that gained Paper Mill a national audience was
``Show Boat,'' taped at the theater last summer for public
television and then shown on ``Great Performances'' in the fall.
The revival, which starred Richard White and Eddie Bracken, will be
repeated later this year on PBS.
   During its current season, which ends June 24, Paper Mill
produced an opulent revival of ``Fanny'' with George S. Irving and
Jose Ferrer playing the roles originated on Broadway in 1954 by
Walter Slezak and Ezio Pinza. And it took on Gilbert and Sullivan
in a big-business reworking of one of the duo's most famous works,
``The Mikado.'' Rechristened ``Mikado, Inc.,'' it was the theater's
final offering of a 10-month season.
   ``Mikado, Inc.,' which was conceived, directed and choreographed
by Robert Johanson, the theater's artistic director, was loosely
inspired by the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta. The words are all
new. The music was largely reworked, for example, melodies sung by
one character in the original are now given to another character.
   ``We try to do an eclectic year,'' says Angelo Del Rossi, the
theater's executive producer and a 27-year veteran of the
playhouse. ``We don't try to do things that are too similar. Those
two shows are perfect examples. We have no philosophy. Whatever
excites us is what we want to do.''
   Paper Mill, which also does dramas and comedies, began mixing
new musicals with revivals about five years ago.
   ``There wasn't really very much new out there _ think back to
what Broadway was like then,'' Del Rossi recalls. ``We do musicals
well and thought we were in a perfect position to develop new
musicals.''
   Out of their deliberations came Paper Mill's Musical Theater
Workshop.
   It works like this:
   The theater does a reading _ two performances with script in
hand _ of a new work. The public is invited and feedback is
encouraged from both audience and staff.
   Paper Mill does six readings of new material a year. Its most
recent reading, done in early June, was a musical version of the
Jimmy Stewart classic ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' with music by Joe
Raposo and lyrics by Sheldon Harnick.
   ``Out of those readings, we usually find one show that we like
and bring it to the next phase, the workshop or laboratory phase,''
Del Rossi added. ``At the conclusion of the workshop, if we feel it
deserves a main stage production, then we go ahead and do it. We've
done that with `Sayonara' and `Mikado, Inc.'''
   Del Rossi and Johanson choose their revivals with care, looking
for good shows that somehow have been neglected.
   ``I try to do things that haven't been done continuously, like
`My Fair Lady,''' Del Rossi says. ``We breathed new life into `The
Desert Song' and `The New Moon.' In fact, Beverly Sills saw both
those productions and picked up our whole artistic staff _ our
director, our conductor, our choreographer and our star _ brought
them to City Opera and did both of those shows.''
   ``I love shows that are romantic, have a beautiful love story
and really have a book as well as something of an epic feeling to
them,'' Johanson said. ```Fanny' certainly did. Plus it's fun to
work on something that has no real history. People don't know the
classic production of `Fanny' like they know the classic production
of a `My Fair Lady' or `Fiddler on the Roof.'''
   The Paper Mill Playhouse originally was a paper mill, built in
1790. The long, narrow shoebox of a building was turned into a
theater in 1938. It remained in operation until January 1980 when a
fire destroyed the stage and auditorium.
   ``We were not quite sure we were going to come back,'' said Del
Rossi about the dark days following the fire. ``I didn't want to
come back as the old Paper Mill Playhouse. I wanted to return as a
new theater with new ideas.''
   Reconstruction wasn't easy. In 1980, the interest rate was 16.5
percent. The theater had no money and was surviving from show to
show.
   It took a year for the trustees to approve rebuilding and then
almost two years to actually do it. The final cost was nearly $9
million, much of the money raised by Del Rossi and his staff from
corporations, foundations and from the state.
   From a meager subscription base that would vary between 2,000
and 6,000, Paper Mill today has 43,000 subscribers for its 10-month
season. Plays run five weeks, and musicals are booked for six-week
engagements.
   Paper Mill now has a permanent staff of 40 people who help put
together each show. The scenery is designed and built there and
although costumes are often rented, the theater is developing
facilities to do its own costumes.
   Del Rossi encourages creators of new work not to be be
intimidated by size.
   ``We are one of the few theaters, when we put the search out for
new material, that say `Don't restrict yourselves because of size.'
We want anything that is good and not to have authors afraid to
send us something that has a cast of 24 people. Most of our musical
casts at Paper Mill are 30 to 40 people.''
   The theater is also commissioning new works for the stage.
``Mikado, Inc.'' was one such commission. Among other commissioned
projects, which could turn up in a year or two, are a science
fiction musical and a musical about the last princess of Hawaii.
   ``Next year we're thinking about doing an opera but not like the
Met or the New York City Opera would do it,'' Del Rossi said. ``But
we want to do it the way a musical theater would do it. We just

<HEAD>`Northern Exposure' _ Doctoring in Alaska To Pay Off Med School</HEAD>

   So what's a nice young Jewish doctor doing in
the wilds of Alaska?
   That's the premise of the CBS summer series ``Northern
Exposure,'' in which Dr. Joel Fleishman, who financed medical
school by promising to practice in the Far North for four years,
arrives in Alaska and starts paying his dues.
   ``He's stuck in this little town in Alaska,'' said Josh Brand,
co-writer and producer with John Falsey. ``He doesn't like the
place. He doesn't feel comfortable. He feels he's been tricked,
because they had promised him Anchorage.''
   In the first episode, Fleishman, played by Rob Morrow, learns
he's being sent into the wilderness. Other regulars in the
eight-episode run, which starts July 12, are Barry Corbin, John
Cullum, Janine Turner, John Corbett and Cynthia Geary.
   ``This isn't a medical show. This isn't about the disease of the
week,'' said Brand, who also created ``St. Elsewhere'' with Falsey.
``This is about a fish out of water. It's a show about people.''
   Brand and Falsey became partners as writers for ``The White
Shadow.'' They also guided ``St. Elsewhere'' as producers in its
first year. Later, they created and produced ``A Year in the Life.''
   They also helped Steven Spielberg create the ``Amazing Stories''
series and were its supervising producers the first year.
   ``Northern Exposure'' had its origin in several sources,
including Brand's doctor friend who suggested the original idea for
``St. Elsewhere,'' a series set in a teaching hospital.
   ``We'd read about the state of Maine paying for medical school
to get doctors to practice in small towns,'' Brand said. ``The
genesis of this series was the movie `Cry Wolf,' which was about a
city man going into the northern woods to study wolves, and a
script we'd written about a friend of mine who was a doctor and
joined the New York Police Department. He now practices in rural
New York.''
   The show is being filmed on location in Roslyn, Wash., a small
town about 60 miles east of Seattle, just off Interstate 90 east of
the Cascade Mountains.
   ``It's a one-street town, a little farther out than we wanted,
but it's great,'' Brand said. ``The mountains and the lakes are
magnificent. The skies can be dark and filled with billowing
clouds. It's very clear you're not in Los Angeles.''
   Brand said they discovered a huge mural painted on the wall of a
cafe in Roslyn showing a camel and a palm tree. ``We made up a
story that it was Roslyn's Cafe and Roslyn had been one of the
founders of the town,'' he said.
   The home for Corbin's character is a spectacular log cabin with
40-foot-high ceilings. A 15-foot-long buggy hangs on one wall.
   ``The idea of filming on location is fun, but you're always so
busy you never have time to see anything,'' Brand said. ``I think
I've been in to Seattle once. I'd love to get to the San Juan
Islands, but there's no time. Working on location is a two-headed
monster. No matter where you are, there's another place you need to
be. We have to do all the post-production work in Los Angeles.''
   ``Northern Exposure'' is one of a several summer shows the
networks, particularly CBS, are mounting this year in hopes of
retaining viewers until the fall season premieres, Brand said.
   The summer placement has has its advantages, he said.
   ``The networks have been losing viewers every fall,'' Brand
said. ``They're hoping they won't lose as many this year if they
can keep viewers over the summer. I think CBS is putting more money
into this show than all the summer shows of the past few seasons.
   ``We get to introduce a new show without the intense competition
of the regular season. If it catches on, it'll be back later.''

<HEAD>Leaders in Fight Against AIDS Meet in International Conference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the sixth time in the short history of
AIDS, the top minds in the fight against the disease will gather to
brief each other _ and the world _ about their triumphs and
setbacks.
   The Sixth International Conference on AIDS, which opens
Wednesday, will be a sort of AIDS marathon, five days of terse
reports on almost every aspect of the disease. No dramatic
breakthroughs are likely to be announced, but experts say the
meeting should turn up signs of progress in medicine's effort to
understand and defeat the virus.
   An estimated 11,000 doctors, scientists and other AIDS
professionals will hear about 2,500 presentations, ranging from the
results of experiments with new drugs and vaccines to reports on
the spread of AIDS from mothers to children and from prostitutes to
their customers.
   Such meetings are a staple of medical research, but ordinarily
pass in peaceful obscurity. Last month, for instance, 7,000 doctors
gathered in Washington for the American Society of Clinical
Oncology, the major U.S. cancer meeting. About 100 reporters
chronicled the proceedings.
   Twenty-four times more Americans die of cancer than of AIDS each
year. But AIDS is clearly different.
   Organizers of the AIDS meeting expect 1,800 members of the news
media to attend, drawn both by the newsworthiness of AIDS research
and the possibility of demonstrations and other street drama in San
Francisco, the city with the nation's highest AIDS rate.
   Some scientists might find the publicity unseemly, but many seem
to relish the intense, if fleeting, attention.
   ``All of us recognize that we are in the business of
dissemination of information, and there is simply no better forum
in the world for doing that. It is unmatched,'' said Dr. Robert M.
Wachter of the University of California at San Francisco, the
meeting's program director.
   Inside the Moscone Convention Center, vaccine development is
likely to be one of the hottest topics of discussion.
   ``At this meeting, you will see a lot more positive news about
successes in the vaccine field, testing in chimpanzees and rhesus
monkeys and perhaps some encouraging news in human beings, also,''
said Dr. David Ho, an AIDS researcher at the University of
California, Los Angeles.
   While none of these reports is likely to suggest a vaccine is
close to being ready for widespread use, they at least should hint
that such a preventative measure is possible.
   ``In the first five years of HIV (AIDS virus) research, anything
related to vaccine research has been very discouraging,'' said Ho.
``Over the past year, we have seen a lot more positive results.''
   Much of this work still is at the most basic stages. Scientists
will update their search, for instance, for vulnerable spots on the
surface of the AIDS virus that a vaccine can exploit to attack and
destroy it.
   Scientists also will report on the uses of AZT and
still-experimental drugs by people who are infected with HIV but
not yet sick.
   The goal of such treatment is to keep them healthy, but the new
studies show people quickly grow resistant to the helpful effects
of the drugs.
   Whether such treatment should be reserved for later stages of
the disease, when victims might benefit more, is expected to be a
major topic of the conference.
   Many reports also are planned on new AIDS drugs still in the
test-tube stage of development. Researchers are creating these
medicines to attack the virus at various points in its life cycle.
   ``It will be some time before they get to the clinic, but there
has been a tremendous amount of progress in the past year in
understanding the virus and translating that information into
designing new drugs,'' said Dr. William Haseltine of the
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.
   While much of the research will be new information, a good deal
also will be stale, at least to AIDS insiders. Because of the
intense interest in AIDS, major developments rarely remain secret
for long.
   ``We hear about events almost as they happen, rather than in the
artificially contrived schedule of meetings,'' said Dr. Clifford
Lane of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
``The way communication goes these days, there's no time delay
anymore.''
   Other expected topics include the effect of AIDS on sexual
practices, the risk of passing on the AIDS virus during pregnancy,
AIDS hazards among health care workers, and the cost of paying for
the epidemic.
   The conference will include about half as many presentations as
last year's meeting in Montreal, largely because it will pay
significantly less attention to social issues.
   Non-scientific subjects explored last year, but not this time,
include erotica, AIDS coping strategies, AIDS in the arts, and the
religious response to the disease.
   ``Montreal made a conscious effort to emphasize the social side
of the epidemic,'' said Wachter. ``We heard from a number of
scientists that they didn't get as much out of the conference as
they would like. This encouraged us to be as sensitive to the needs
of people working in the lab looking for new vaccines as we were to
people working in the community.''

   The deficit in the broadest measure of U.S.
trade shrank to a six-year low of $22.94 billion during the first
three months of the year, the government reported. Analysts,
however, cautioned that the good news may be temporary.
   The Commerce Department Tuesday credited a record level of
American merchandise exports, increased spending by foreign
tourists and higher U.S. investment earnings for the 14 percent
improvement in the current account deficit compared to 1989's
fourth quarter, when the deficit was $26.69 billion.

   The report released Tuesday capped a six-month study

away many individual investors already shaken by the 1987 crash and
provoking an outcry against program trading.
   The group proposed that the NYSE install ``circuit-breakers'' to

Corp. in Monroeville, a Pittsburgh suburb, showed 16.6 percent of
female and 8.6 percent of male managers were clinically depressed
in the year prior to the survey, which was taken in 1987 and 1988.

<TEXT>
   A New York Stock Exchange report clears program
trading as the major villain in market turmoil and gives ammunition
to officials seeking a super-regulator for stocks and their spinoff
products.
   The report is the latest study into wild price movements blamed
for scaring off small investors. It was written by a blue-ribbon
panel formed after the market plunged last October in a near-repeat
of the 1987 crash.
   The panel's conclusion that the most popular program trading
strategy, index arbitrage, is a ``natural feature'' in stock and
stock-index futures markets is likely to reignite a simmering
debate.
   The NYSE group was composed primarily of representatives of Wall
Street, large corporations and big insitutional money managers _
which largely have opposed placing restrictions on program trading.
   ``It's simply an affirmation of the fact that the NYSE has
surrendered all of their hopes and dreams to the institutions,''
said Charles Wohlstetter, chairman of Contel Corp. and a program
trading opponent.
   In its main proposal, the panel supported coordinated ``circuit
breakers'' in the cash, futures and options markets that would stop
trading during wide market fluctuations.
   The system would place a 400-point cap on the possible daily
rise or fall in the Dow Jones industrial average and allow for the
stock market to close for nearly a full day in the case of rapid
price movements. The average plummeted 508 points in the record
crash of Oct. 19, 1987.
   General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger Smith, who led the 19-member
panel, said the circuit breakers would provide ``a breathing spell
in the market'' in chaotic times.
   The panel proposed halting trading for one hour if the Dow Jones
average moves up or down 100 points from the previous day's close;
another 90 minutes if it moves 200 points; and two hours each if it
moves 300 points and 400 points. Stoppages would be coordinated
with the nation's futures markets.
   But opponents have said such a measure, a less restrictive form
of which already exists, would limit individual investors' ability
to get out of the market during a downturn. There were no circuit
breakers in effect at the time of the 1987 crash.
   The Big Board panel took the view that index arbitrage and other
forms of program trading are here to stay. Index arbitrage involves
rapid trading of stocks in New York and stock-index futures in
Chicago to profit from momentary price discrepancies between the
two markets.
   Critics blamed the practice for worsening the market's freefall
during the 1987 crash and again last Oct. 13, when the Dow Jones
industrial average fell 190 points. Many large Wall Street
brokerages pulled back on program trading after last year's
mini-crash, but their customers did not.
   In February, the NYSE proposed restricting stock-index arbitrage
when the Dow Jones average is up or down 50 points or more. That
proposal still is pending before the Securities and Exchange
Commission and wasn't affected by the new report.
   At the time, the NYSE said program trading strategies ``may
create excess volatility that undermines investor confidence in the
fairness and orderliness of the securities markets, and may in fact
constitute a threat to the viability of America's capital markets.''
   But the blue-ribbon panel report, endorsed by NYSE Chairman John
J. Phelan Jr., concludes that ``there is little evidence that index
arbitrage causes an increase in volatility as usually measured.''
   The closest the report comes to criticizing the practice is a
statement that ``it is possible that program trading and index
arbitrage exacerbate short-term volatility.''
   The panel also called for creating a single agency to regulate
the nation's stock and stock-index futures markets. That finding
rankled the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which would be likely to
lose authority under a super-regulator, and is sure to deepen the
debate.
   The Bush administration already has endorsed legislation that
would give the Securities and Exchange Commission control over the
markets.
   SEC Chairman Richard S. Breeden said he was ``extremely
pleased'' with the NYSE panel's recommendation. He said it ``in
essence fully confirms'' the proposed legislation.
   But Chicago Merc Chairman Leo Melamed, a panel member, attached
a dissent to the report. ``A majority of the panel simply mirrored
a popular perception that consolidation of regulation seems
desirable,'' it said.
   Some of the conclusions in the latest report overlap findings in
more than a dozen studies undertaken following the 1987 crash,
including the government's Brady Commission report that endorsed
circuit breakers. The Brady Commission, however, placed more blame
on program trading as a source of volatility.
   Phelan said the report would be voted on by the exchange's board
and its recommendations discussed with other financial markets.

<HEAD>United Brands Agrees to Let Fyffa Buy Honduran Bananas</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A three-month-old banana battle has
ended with United Brands agreeing to let the Irish-English firm
Fyffes buy Honduran bananas and gain a toehold in the Central
American country for the first time.
   The agreement between New York-based United Brands and more than
600 independent producers affects about 1 million of the 47 million
boxes of bananas Honduras exports annually. But the dispute
ballooned to far greater proportions.
   United Brands, which had exported all of the bananas from the
independent producers, will buy 60 percent until March 31, 1991,
and let Fyffes buy the other 40 percent. After that date the
independents, who wanted to accept Fyffes' higher prices, will be
free to sell to the highest bidder.
   The agreement, announced Tuesday by the Economy Ministry, was
reached on Sunday.
   The dispute arose in March after independent producers sold to
Fyffes, which has 26 European subsidiaries.
   United Brands argued that the sale violated its exclusive
contract with the producers, which expires in 1991. With a judge's
consent, the company had employees go to the dock where a Fyffes
shipment was waiting and throw tens of thousands of boxes of
bananas into the sea, give them away to local people or stomp on
them.
   United Brands, which has operated in Honduras since 1912, argued
that it invests in the country while Fyffes wants only to buy.
   Over the past 50 years United has accounted for 60 percent of
Honduran banana exports. San Francisco-based Castle &amp; Cook exports
the other 40 percent.
   The two companies also produce all but the 1 million boxes grown
by the independents. United employs about 8,000 people and Castle &amp;
Cook 4,000 on their plantations.
   Honduras is the world's fourth largest banana producer after
Ecuador, Costa Ricaand Colombia.
   As a result of the fray, the government said Tuesday it was
studying the possibility of rejoining the Union of Banana Exporting
Countries and would change its banana policy.
   The country withdrew from the marketing union four years ago,
saying it could not pay the $500,000 dues. It owes the organization
$1.2 million in back dues, half of which the union has forgiven.
   The union's seven members and Honduras account for half the
world's banana production.
   ``The new Honduran banana policy will be directed toward
protecting the national activity to impede the resurgence of
monopolies, local as well as international,'' Assistant Economy
Minister Ramiro Figueroa said at a news conference.

<HEAD>UAL's Wolf Has `Cordial' Talk with Greenwald</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp. Chairman Stephen Wolf and his would-be
successor held a ``cordial and open discussion'' at their first
meeting, and the airline company's No. 2 officer said he'll quit if
employees pull off their buyout bid.
   The four-hour meeting Tuesday between Wolf and former Chrysler
Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald reflected their stated desire for a
smooth transfer of power in the event that UAL's employees succeed
in their proposed $4.54 billion takeover of the company, parent of
United Airlines.
   Lawrence Nagin, a UAL senior vice president for corporate and
external affairs, said the private meeting at a hotel near O'Hare
International Airport consisted of a ``cordial and open
discussion.''
   Nagin quoted Wolf as saying: ``Jerry Greenwald was gracious and
forthcoming and well prepared for a discussion of United's future.''
   Separately, John C. Pope, UAL's chief financial officer and
executive vice president for marketing and planning, said he would
leave UAL if the employee-led buyout goes through.
   Pope's announcement was not a surprise. Wolf told shareholders
at the company's annual meeting in April that neither he nor Pope
expected to remain in their positions after a worker buyout.
   Greenwald agreed last week to head the acquisition company
formed by United's pilots, flight attendants and Machinists.
   He would become UAL's chairman and chief executive, replacing
Wolf, should the union group secure financing to complete the
$201-a-share buyout.
   Tuesday's meeting was the first face-to-face encounter between
the two executives since Greenwald joined the buyout effort, said
Steven Matthews, spokesman for the union group.
   ``I'm not even certain there was an agenda other than to sit
down and say hello to each other,'' Matthews said.
   He added that the union group has not yet obtained financing.
   Greenwald reportedly received $5 million to join the buyout
effort and is guaranteed to receive $12 million more in salary and
fees over the next five years if the deal is completed.
   Meanwhile, Northwest Airlines announced Monday it had hired away
the chief executive of Covia-Apollo, an automated airline
reservation system half owned by United.
   Covia-Apollo CEO Barry A. Kotar's jump to Northwest is believed
to be the first major defection from UAL since the union group
proposed buying the nation's second-largest airline in April.
   Kotar will become executive vice president and chief information
officer of Northwest, the company said in a statement.
   The proposed UAL buyout includes the likely sale of United's
stake in the reservations system.

<TEXT>
   Top officials of U.S. financial exchanges and
several major accounting and securities firms have joined forces
with the Securities and Exchange Commission to determine the best
ways of helping the new free market economies of Eastern Europe.
   In its first gathering Tuesday, the SEC's Emerging Markets
Advisory Committee mapped preliminary strategy and planned smaller
working groups.
   ``It is the right thing for the United States to give the
benefit of our knowledge and our experience to these other
countries,'' SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden told the blue ribbon
panel.
   The group included Michael Minikes, senior managing director of
investment bank Bear Stearns; American Stock Exchange Chairman
James R. Jones; Joseph Hardiman, president of the National
Association of Securities Dealers Inc., and Leo Melamed, head of
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Breeden proposed setting up the panel in March and has sought an
active role in helping Easter Europe emerge from decades of
socialism.
   He will travel to Hungary later this month to speak at the
official reopening of the Budapest Stock Exchange _ dormant since
1948 when the Communists came to power. He also has met with
Polish, Hungarian and Soviet officials in recent months.
   Breeden noted that foreign officials who have sought SEC
assistance and advice do not have time for lengthy reports and
studies.
   ``They want assistance that is practical and concrete,'' he
advised the panelists.
   Also addressing the group was Oscar Espinosa Villareal,
president of Mexico's national securities commission, and Michael
J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
   ``We must not only work to develop the markets that already
exist, but we must also provide the necessary priority to the
markets that do not yet exist; specifically, we must focus on the
countries of Eastern Europe in their process of incorporation to a
market economy,'' Espinosa Villareal said.
   A surprise guest was Wieslaw Rozlucki, an adviser to Poland's
Finance Ministry, who was in Washington to attend a World Bank
conference.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Overturns SEC's One Share, One Vote Rule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission's
attempt to prevent corporations from creating different classes of
stock with unequal voting rights has been thwarted by a federal
appeals court.
   A three-judge appeals panel in Washington ruled unanimously that
the SEC exceeded its authority when it imposed a so-called ``one
share, one vote'' rule.
   That supported the contention of The Business Roundtable, an
association of the nation's top corporations, which claimed the SEC
rule interfered with the traditional role of the individual states
in regulating corporate governance.
   The SEC had contended that its federal mandate to protect
investors in publicly traded companies gave it the right to impose
the one share, one vote rule.
   But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia said the SEC went beyond its congressionally mandated
authority to oversee the financial markets.
   ``Because the rule directly controls the substantive allocation
of powers among classes of shareholders, we find it in excess of
the Commission's authority,'' the panel said in a 21-page opinion
written by Circuit Judge Stephen F. Williams. Concurring with
Williams were circuit judges James L. Buckley and Harry T. Edwards.
   ``I was disappointed,'' said Richard G. Ketchum, head of the
SEC's Division of Market Regulation. SEC officials will have to
review the opinion before deciding whether to appeal, he said.
   The United Shareholders Association, a Washington-based
stockholders' rights group founded by T. Boone Pickens, also
bemoaned the decision as ``a major blow to America's 47 million
shareholders and the entire free-enterprise system.''
   USA Director Ralph Whitworth urged the SEC to appeal the ruling
to the Supreme Court.
   The head of the Roundtable's corporate governance task force
hailed the decision, though.
   ``American shareholders won an important victory today,'' said
Bruce Atwater, who is also chief executive officer of General
Mills. ``The court has resoundingly affirmed their right to
determine for themselves what kinds of equities best serve their
interests.''
   The Business Roundtable argued that the SEC had overstepped its
authority and was trying to regulate how companies are run, a
traditional role of the states. The states of Ohio, Delaware,
Kentucky, Michigan, Idaho, Pennsylvania, Wyoming, Nebraska, North
Carolina, Missouri, Georgia and West Virginia had filed court
papers supporting the group's stance.
   The Roundtable is an association of 200 companies that includes
American Express Co., Xerox Corp., Citicorp and General Mills.
   ``It's a very important decision that limits the SEC's attempt
to regulate corporate governance,'' said attorney Robert D.
Rosenbaum, who represented the group in oral arguments last
November before the appeals court.
   The appeals court found that SEC authority to compel full
corporate disclosure to shareholders ``doesn't extend to what
shareholders can decide,'' Rosenbaum said.
   The SEC rule in question, Rule 19c-4, was adopted in July 1988.
It prohibited publicly traded corporations from weakening the
voting power of existing stockholders by issuing new classes of
stock with superior or ``supervoting'' rights.
   In filings with the appeals court last fall, the SEC claimed
that without the curb, ``shareholders could be stripped of their
ability to participate in management, and confidence in the
securities markets could be impaired.''
   Rule 19c-4 allowed the SEC to bar an offending company's stock
from being listed on any stock exchange that it regulated or with
the National Association of Securities Dealers stock quotation
system, Nasdaq.
   The SEC claimed Congress intended it to have such authority to
ensure that exchanges didn't lower their listing standards to
attract more corporate stock listings.
   But the appeals court said that intent only concerned the SEC's
authority to govern exchanges and quote systems _ not corporations.
   ``To argue that Congress's `equal regulation' mandate supports
SEC control over corporate governance through national listing
standards is to gamble that the court will accept a Commission spin
on a statutory fragment without even a glance at its context,''
said the court, adding: ``Wrong court, bad gamble.''
   The SEC's Ketchum said he did not think the ruling would cause
the nation's stock exchanges to lower their listing requirements.

<HEAD>To Issue 27 Million Shares To Help Pay for Shearson Buyout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Express Co. plans to issue more than
$800 million worth of stock to help finance its shoring up of
troubled investment banking subsidiary Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The travel and charge card company said Tuesday would issue 27
million shares of common stock, which would bring in about $825
million at current market prices before selling costs.
   Most of the proceeds will be used to eliminate $500 million in
short-term debt American Express took on in March when it bought
$750 million worth of Shearson preferred stock.
   American Express has injected more than $1 billion into Shearson
in recent months and is taking full control in an effort to
revitalize the struggling Wall Street house.
   American Express already owns 60 percent of Shearson, the
nation's second-largest brokerage. The company said it expects to
buy the remainder of Shearson in the third quarter.
   Nippon Life Insurance Co. will buy $300 million of the stock
offering. The purchase is intended to replace the Japanese
company's stake in Shearson that is being sold to American Express
in the buyout, American Express said in a statement.
   After its purchase of the new stock, Nippon Life's total
investment in American Express will be less than 5 percent of the
company's nearly 447 million shares.
   Nippon Life plans to pay the lesser of the public offering price
or $30.96 a share for not less than 9.69 million shares.
   American Express closed at $30.37{ Tuesday, down 25 cents, in
New York Stock Exchange trading. The offering was announced after
the stock market closed.
   The offering is subject to completion of the merger between
American Express and Shearson and regulatory approvals. Officials
expect the offering to be made in early July.
   Shearson lost $915 million in the first three months of the
year, a record in the securities industry. It announced a
restructuring earlier this month that will consolidate the firm
into two divisions instead of four.
   The divisions will be Shearson Lehman Brothers for individual
investing and asset management, and Lehman Brothers for investment
banking and capital markets activities. The full firm will be known
as Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   American Express began taking charge of its ailing subsidiary
late last year. The changes have included replacing chairman Peter
A. Cohen, who led Shearson through a large expansion in the 1980s,
with Howard L. Clark Jr., a top American Express official.
   American Express also has pumped capital into Shearson and
engineeried a major restructuring that has resulted in more than
2,000 layoffs.

<HEAD>Company Suspends Crude Shipments to Most U.S. Ports Because of
Liability</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Royal Dutch Shell Group, the world's biggest oil
company, said it will stop docking its crude and fuel oil tankers
at all but one U.S. port because of what it said were huge
liability risks.
   ``The Exxon Valdez made it clear what happens when you have a
spill and the enormous liabilities you can face,'' said Norm
Altstedter, a New York spokesman for the Anglo-Dutch company.
   The decision has no relation to the fire on the Mega Borg
supertanker some 57 miles offshore from Galveston, Altstedter said.
``It was made solely as a commercial decision,'' he said.
   Under the decision, shipments of crude and fuel oils in tankers
owned or operated by the Royal Dutch Shell Group will be limited to
the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port.
   About 80 percent of the company's U.S. shipments of some 180,000
barrels a day involve such oils, but only 40,000 barrels a day will
be affected by the decision, Altstedter said. The rest of the
shipments already go to the port about 20 miles offshore Louisiana,
he said.
   The remainder of the company's U.S. shipments involve light oil
products such as kerosene and gasoline and won't be affected by the
decision, he said.
   The suspension came after a review of the risks and rewards to
such trading in the United States, the spokesman said.
   ``The U.S. has not yet ratified the international conventions,
which limit liability,'' Altstedter said. ``And there's no
limitation on liability or the magnitude of legalities.''
   Exxon Corp. was indicted in February on five federal charges
stemming from the grounding of the Valdez in March 1989. The
government said it would seek at least $700 million in penalties
from the oil company under a law that allows recovery of twice the
amount of proven losses.
   Exxon also has spent more than $2 billion to clean up the 11
million gallons of crude released in the nation's worst oil spill.
   The marine activities of Shell Oil Co. USA, the U.S. subsidiary
of Royal Dutch Shell, are not affected by the decision, officials
said.
   ``We don't own ships,'' said H.R. Hutchins, Shell USA spokesman
at the company's Houston headquarters. ``We charter everything from
groups. Royal Dutch Shell is one of many groups we use. This will
have little or no effect on Shell Oil USA.''

<HEAD>Chrysler, Renault Scrap Joint Production Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. may go ahead and produce a new
small Jeep on its own after it and French automaker Renault backed
out of a deal to jointly make the vehicle, a company official said.
   The automakers said Tuesday they were calling off a planned $500
million project to jointly develop the vehicles for European and
North American production in the mid-1990s. Chrysler spokesman Tom
Houston said the joint project was no longer attractive
economically.
   The collapse of the deal comes as Chrysler and other automakers
worldwide eye economic developments in Western and Eastern Europe,
which represent the world's biggest auto market.
   Analyst Chuck Brady said he was surprised by the announcement.
   ``I don't see what has changed to make it uneconomical,'' said
Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York. ``It doesn't make any
sense.''
   Last week, General Motors Corp. announced a joint venture with
Volga Auto Works of the Soviet Union. GM executives said the
project to provide fuel system components represented their
entrance to a potentially huge marketplace.
   Although Houston said the planned joint venture was no longer
attractive, he indicated Chrysler is considering developing the
vehicle, code-named ``JJ,'' by itself or with another partner.
   ``Chrysler intends to continue with the `JJ' project and is
reviewing various implementation alternatives,'' Houston said,
declining to disclose details.
   The two companies said last February the vehicle would be
produced in Valladolid, Spain, and that a North American site would
be chosen later.
   Chrysler has been negotiating with public officials in Ohio and
the United Auto Workers union over the fate of the company's Jeep
plant in Toledo.
   There has been intense speculation that Chrysler wanted to
transfer production of the Jeep Wrangler, now made in Canada, to
Toledo and add ``JJ'' production later.
   On Monday, members of UAW Local 12 in Toledo approved by a wide
margin a new labor agreement seen as key to bringing production of
the ``JJ'' and the Wrangler to the Toledo factory, which is
approaching 70 years old.
   Chrysler has been getting the lion's share of its profits from
sales of its minivans and its Jeep line, which it acquired with the
purchase of American Motors Corp. in August 1987.
   But recently, Chrysler's profits and sales have been falling.
The company's profits fell 80 percent in the first quarter to $71
million, and its vehicle sales tumbled 12.8 percent in the first
five months of this year.

<HEAD>Game Allows Home Viewers to Get Involved in TV Football</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Home television viewers will be
able to match wits with NFL quarterbacks and win prizes by calling
plays in an interactive football game popular in sports bars,
taverns and hotels.
   Interactive Network Inc. of Mountain View, National Football
League Properties Inc. in New York and NTN Communications Inc. of
Carlsbad, Calif., jointly announced Tuesday an agreement to make
NTN's ``QB1'' game available to home TV viewers.
   David Lockton, president and chief executive officer of
Interactive Network, said in New York that the game will cost $400
to $500 for the control unit plus a subscription fee of about $15 a
month for access to a family of programs.
   The system will be available in Northern California in 1990 and
will begin to be rolled out nationwide in 1991.
   He predicted that 400,000 to 500,000 homes would have the system
in 1991 and that the market would grow substantially in future
seasons.
   More than 1 million people have played QB1 in sports bars since
its introduction four years ago, said NTN president Patrick J.
Downs, and about 50,000 played it during this year's Super Bowl.
   The game is played on a cordless, wireless terminal with
simulcasted data of the action. All the information required to
play along is received by the FM receiver in the control unit, much
like a stereo simulcast.
   Players watching the game on TV or listening on radio make
judgments on whether the next play will be a pass or a run and get
points for their decisions. They can gain extra points by
predicting whether the play is to the left, right or middle, or
whether the pass is long or short.
   A lockout signal is sent instantaneously to all players to
prevent entering calls after the ball is snapped, then the correct
answer is sent out by an NFL referee who sits at a computer console
punching in the types of plays.
   As the players go along, their scores are continually updated
after each play. At the end of the game, players can compare their
scores to other players by plugging a phone to the back of the unit
for a few seconds. The score is transmitted to Interactive
Network's computer, ranked and rebroadcast over the FM.
   Within five minutes, even if millions of players are playing,
Interactive Network will be able to tell who won the game, Lockton
said.
   Since the game is considered one of skill, rather than luck, NTN
and the game's sponsors are legally able to offer prizes, including
trips to winners. The sports bars charge varying amounts to play,
some offering the game for free to patrons who consume a certain
amount of food or drinks.
   For home players, Interactive Network is considering a variety
of awards to recognize winners.
   The game uses Interactive's patented technology, which was
developed by Lockton in the early 1980s and licensed to NTN for the
sports bar game. Interactive holds the patent on the only practical
working technology that permits home competition and scoring
without engaging the telephone line throughout the contest.
   ``Interactive Network's system not only adds a new dimension to
television viewership, but it provides the television industry an
opportunity to offer interactive advertising, couponing,
sweepstakes and other promotional activities in conjunction with
commercials run in this interactive environment,'' said Tom Rogers,
head of business development for NBC and president of NBC Cable.
   Interactive Network has been testing a baseball game licensed
with Major League Baseball Properties Inc., and has deals in the
works with the NHL and NBA.
   In addition to contests based on live televised sports, the
system will permit home television viewers to play along
simultaneously with game shows, as well as interact directly with
television news programs, educational programs and special event
broadcasts.

<HEAD>Delta, Singapore and Swissair Happy Together But Also Want
Individuality</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief executive officers of Delta Air Lines,
Singapore Airlines and Swissair say their year-old alliance is
flying high with several new joint projects in the works.
   But the CEOs emphasized in a meeting with reporters Tuesday that
the three airlines continue to maintain a certain distance, and
that their relationship is not likely to evolve into anything more
formal, such as a merger.
   ``Each one is proud of our own personality,'' said Cheong Choong
Kong, chief executive officer of Singapore. ``No one seeks to tell
the other parties how to run their airline.''
   The three got together last year, joining through cross-equity
investments for a number of projects.
   Cheong, along with CEOs Ronald W. Allen of Delta and Otto Loepfe
of Swissair, said Tuesday that the alliance so far has produced
such tangible gains as Delta's recent loan of 70 flight attendants
to Swissair to help with a personnel shortage and an agreement
between Delta and Singapore for blocked space on traffic between
Singapore and Dallas@Fort Worth and New York.
   The three airlines also have joined in expanded frequent flier
programs, coordinated global flight schedules and joint fares.
   The airline chiefs said Tuesday they are working on plans for
joint purchasing, aircraft interchange flights, global tour
packages and a global small package delivery service.
   Cheong said the three executives during meetings Monday and
Tuesday in Atlanta ``accomplished quite a lot'' on the tour package
project as well as joint fare and advertising plans. But he said
the aircraft interchange will take more time to develop.
   Kevin Murphy, who follows Delta for Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New
York, said such alliances, which open international doors for
airlines, ``are the order of the day for the 1990s.''
   He said the strength of Delta's alliance with Singapore and
Swissair is the compatibility of the three carriers' operating
styles.
   ``As far as equality of service, if there are three airlines
that should ... run like a Swiss watch, these are they,'' Murphy
said.
   Murphy said it is notable that Delta established its global
alliance during the heightened airline takeover activity of last
summer, when the Atlanta-based carrier was frequently mentioned as
an attractive target.
   ``They also act as white squires for Delta,'' Murphy said of
Swissair and Singapore.
   Delta's Allen said the three airlines continue to be
competitors, however friendly.
   ``We will all keep our individual identities. We will continue
to be competitive with one another,'' he said. The success of the
alliance, he added, ``doesn't preclude our (Delta's) continued
expansion internationally ... nor does it preclude expansion by
Singapore or Swissair.''

   Rescue crews working on air bag-equipped
cars should disconnect the vehicles' batteries to assure the safety
devices don't accidentally deploy, a fire official says.
   Automakers began installing air bags en masse late last year
because of governmental regulation requiring passive restraint
systems on 1990 and later model cars.
   The devices are standard equipment on all of Chrysler Corp.'s
U.S. made cars, about half of Ford Motor Co.'s and about 15 percent
of General Motors Corp.'s.
   This week, firefighters from around the United States and Canada
are at the GM proving grounds west of Detroit using crash-test cars
to practice roadside rescue techniques and learn about new
technology in cars, including air bags.
   Some of firefighters said Tuesday there was concern about armed
air bags deploying during rescue operations.
   ``You don't put yourself between an (undeployed) air bag and the
victim,'' said Ken Jones of Owen Sound, Ontario, and a member of
the Ontario Fire Marshal's Office. ``The information about the
(new) technology of the cars hasn't been disseminated to us.''
   The Big Three automakers have issued owner's and dealer service
manuals describing how the devices work, precautions to take while
working near them and disclaimers saying failure to follow
directions could result in injury.
   ``If somebody is there with their nose against the bag and the
thing goes off, I guess somebody might get injured,'' said GM
spokesman Don Postma.
   The cardinal rule, automakers say, is to disable the car's
electrical system, which powers the air bag. The device, designed
to be used with manual lap and shoulder seat belts, is a large
pillow flattened and stored in a steering wheel or dash board. It
inflates in a tenth of a second and begins deflating immediately.
   Other passive restraint systems include an automatic shoulder
belt on a track used with a manual lap belt, and an automatic lap
and shoulder belt system.
   In a garage, disabling a car's electrical system along with the
air bag is simply a matter of unbolting battery cables. At a crash
scene, things are more complicated.
   If it is difficult to locate the battery or determine if its
cables are intact, then automakers recommend mechanics and rescuers
go under the steering column to disconnect the air bag.

<HEAD>SmithKline Beecham Accuses Bolar of Dyazide Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   SmithKline Beecham has filed a law suit
accusing two competitors of lying to obtain government approval for
generic versions of SmithKline's anti-hypertension drug Dyazide.
   Bolar Pharmaceutical Co., Inc., of Copiague, N.Y., and Vitarine
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., of Springfield Gardens, N.Y., both
manufactured and sold generic versions of Dyazide until the past
year, when allegations of false reports to the Food and Drug
Administration surfaced.
   The suit, filed in federal court Tuesday, accuses Bolar of
falsifying evidence that its generic drug is Dyazide's
bioequivalent _ that is, the generic drug achieves the same effect
in the same dosage.
   The suit accuses Bolar of back-dating testing studies to make it
appear the company's tests were performed on a batch of Dyazide
when in fact they were performed on a batch that was not prepared
according to federal procedures.
   Bolar took its generic version of the drug off the market in
January after acknowledging that the company had faked lab tests to
win FDA approval.
   Vitarine, when taking their version off the market in June 1989,
admitted its substituted Dyazide for its product in tests required
to win FDA approval.
   ``SmithKline was injured ... because those schemes and
representations enabled (the companies) to obtain FDA approval ...
to sell their generic versions of Dyazide to persons who otherwise
would have bought Dyazide from (SmithKline),'' the suit claims.
   Dyazide is one of SmithKline's best-selling products, with
annual sales exceeding $300 million in 1987, according to the suit.
In 1988, after the generic substitutes entered the market, sales
fell to $153 million.
   The suit characterizes the companies actions as a violation of
the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and asks for
unspecified damages.
   Also named in the 12-count suit are Bolar's president, Robert
Shulman, and Port Washington, N.Y.-based Schein Pharmaceutical,
Inc., the company that developed, marketed and sold Bolar's version.
   An assistant to Bolar's general counsel, who did not give her
name, said she could not comment on the suit late Tuesday because
the company had not received a copy of the complaint.
   Officials at Vitarine did not return a message left at their
offices Tuesday afternoon.
   Smithkline Beecham PLC is the big pharmaceutical company formed
last summer in the merger of Smithkline Beckman Corp. and Britain's
Beecham PLC.

   Retail sales slumped 0.7 percent in May,
posting their first three-month decline since the last recession in
1981, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said sales decreased to a seasonally
adjusted $146.84 billion from $147.93 billion in April.
   After remaining unchanged in February, retail sales fell a
revised 0.4 percent in March and 0.9 percent in April. That was
worse than the 0.3 percent decline first reported for March and the
0.6 percent dip in April.
   Many economists had expected a slight improvement in sales in
May.
   It was the first time since September, October and November 1981
that retail sales had fallen for three straight months.
   Retail sales represent about half of consumer spending, which
has been a driving force for the economy during much of the last
eight years. Overall, consumer spending accounts for about
two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
   Retail sales had jumped 2.8 percent in January when automobile
purchases spurted after cash rebates and low-interest financing
were restored to attract buyers.
   Each of the automakers continues to offer incentives, but fewer
cars are covered as companies try to wean consumers from the
profit-eroding practice.
   Commerce said automobiles slipped 0.6 percent in May following a
1.6 percent drop in April. Through May 31, car sales had dropped
10.3 percent over the comparable period of 1989, manufacturers
reported last week.
   Excluding autos, retail sales were off 0.8 percent in May after
dropping 0.7 percent in April and 0.6 percent in March.
   The manufacturing sector including the automobile industry has
been dampened by Federal Reserve efforts to restrain credit to
avoid overheating the economy and thus fueling inflation.
   Economists also question the effect of a slowing job market and
declining consumer confidence on future retail sales.
   Most recent job gains reflected temporary government hiring of
census workers, while employment losses continued at factories and
in the construction industry.
   Economists will be watching for Thursday's business inventory
report to see whether any drawdown would be sufficient to increase
production and thus create more jobs.
   Sales of durable goods _ usually costly items like automobiles
which are expected to last at least three years _ fell 1.1 percent
in May after dropping 1.7 percent in April.
   In that category, building materials plunged 4.2 percent after a
3.2 percent drop a month earlier. Furniture and other home
furnishings were down 1.1 percent on top of a 0.5 percent gain in
April.
   Sales of non-durable goods such as food and clothing slipped 0.5
percent, the same as in April.
   Gains were posted by only by apparel, up 2.4 percent and
offsetting a 2.4 percent decline a month earlier.
   Declines included general department stores, down 1.0 percent on
top of a 2.1 percent decrease in April.
   A survey focusing only on the country's largest chain department
stores shows sales had generally been sluggish in May because of
colder-than-normal temperatures and unusually heavy rainfall in
some areas.
   Grocery stores sales were down 1.0 percent after rising 1.2
percent a month earlier.
   Gasoline sales were off 1.6 percent after falling 1.9 percent in
April. Drug store sales were down 1.3 percent after rising 2.1
percent a month earlier. Sales at restaurants and bars slipped 0.5
percent after a 1.1 percent decline the previous month.
   For the three months from March through May, overall retail
sales were off 0.3 percent.

<HEAD>Examiner Appointed in Revco Bankruptcy Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Harold F. White
has appointed Barry L. Zaretsky, a Brooklyn Law School professor,
as an outside examiner to look into the 1986 debt-financed buyout
of Revco D.S. Inc.
   Zaretsky, counsel to the New York-based law firm of Kelly Drye &amp;
Warren, said the appointment appears to be the first time an
examiner has been appointed to review a junk bond-financed buyout
during bankruptcy.
   Any decision could have a bearing, retroactively, on junk
bond-financed LBOs as a way to buy companies, said Leonard Borrino,
of Makovsky &amp; Co., a New York public relations firm representing
Kelly Drye &amp; Warren.
   Zaretsky said he will be investigating whether Revco took on too
much debt when it went from a publicly held company to a private
one during a $1.5 billion, management-led leveraged buyout.
   Zaretsky, whose appointment was approved by the judge Tuesday,
was ordered to file a preliminary report by July 16.
   The Revco buyout failed in 1988. Revco's was the first major
debt-financed buyout to seek protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Act.
   This year the suburban Cleveland-based drugstore chain, one of
the country's largest, decided to sell more than 700 of its 2,000
stores in order to concentrate on eastern operations, where sales
are strongest.
   In a leveraged buyout, the buyer borrows the purchase money with
the intention of repaying it through earnings and asset sales.
   The appointment of an examiner was requested by U.S. Trustee
Conrad J. Morgenstern, who supervised the Revco bankruptcy case.

<HEAD>U.S. Jewelry Store Chain Giant to Make Inroad to Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The big U.S. jewelry store chain Zale Corp. will
create franchises in Japan in collaboration with Japanese concerns,
a spokesman for one of the Japanese companies involved said
Wednesday.
   Zale's planned entry into the Japanese market coincides with
Tokyo's efforts toward easing a rigid regulation which restricts
the entry of foreign retailers.
   According to the spokesman at C. Itoh &amp; Co., who spoke on
condition of anonymity, the Texas-based jewelry store chain will
open its first store in downtown Tokyo in September jointly with C.
Itoh and a Japanese jewelry chain store named Tsurukame Corp.
   The action is the first inroad for the U.S. jewelry giant into
the market, the spokesman said.
   Zale expects to expand to about 1,000 Japanese stores over the
next decade, the spokesman said.
   As a result of the link-up, Zale will buy a one percent stake in
Tsurukame. C. Itoh already holds an 11 percent interest in
Tsurukame, which will acquire a one percent stake in Peoples
Jewelers Ltd., Zale's parent company, the spokesman said.
   Zale is the world's largest jewelry store chain, with sales at
about $1.38 billion in the fiscal year ended last March.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar closed mostly lower against the
major currencies in European trading Wednesday but rose against the
West German mark.
   Gold prices fell.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the main factor affecting the
dollar was the unexpected decline of 0.7 percent in U.S. retail
sales in May. The slide, which suggests U.S. economic growth is
continuing to slow, sparked anxiety that the Federal Reserve may be
tempted to lower domestic interest rates, which would make the
dollar less attractive for investors.
   Two more U.S. indicators this week also may affect the dollar _
producer prices on Thursday and trade figures on Friday.
   Further signs of softer U.S. economic activity would send the
dollar lower, dealers said.
   The dollar was firm against the mark because of continuing
concern over the impact of the monetary union between the two
German states in July. Investors and dealers say they are not
convinced that the transition will be smooth, despite official
assurances that it will be.
   The British pound continued to surge and at $1.7070, up from
$1.7020 on Tuesday, hit its highest level since it reached $1.7090
on Feb. 23.
   Sterling was trading at $1.7107 at midday in New York.
   On top of continuing high interest rates that attract
investments in sterling, there is growing expectation that Britain
will join the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System later this year. Such a move would reduce the wide
fluctuations of sterling in day-to-day trading.
   Other European late dollar rates compared with late Tuesday:
1.6925 West German marks, up from 1.6920; 1.4335 Swiss francs, down
from 1.4367; 5.6880 French francs, down from 5.6950; 1.9045 Dutch
guilders, unchanged; 1,241.00 Italian lire, down from 1,242.35;
1.1722 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1713.
   Earlier in Tokyo the dollar closed at 154.55 Japanese yen, up
from 154.40.
   Selected midday dollar rates in New York included: 1.6885 West
German marks; 1.4274 Swiss francs, 1,238.25 Italian lire; and
$1.1715 Canadian dollars.
   Gold bullion prices fell in busy trading at the end of the day
after the failure of efforts Tuesday to push the price above $358
an ounce. Dealers said the outlook for gold was negative.
   The late bid price of gold in London was $350.15 a troy ounce,
down from $356.25. The Zurich late bid price was $350.50, down from
$355.65.
   Earlier in Hong Kong gold closed at $353.45, down from $356.55.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $4.95 a troy ounce, down
from $5.06.

   Prices rose sharply on London's Stock Exchange
Wednesday, supported by a strong pound, a good showing on Wall
Street and buying by institutional investors.
   There was, however, considerable wariness among investors about
the market's underlying strength, said dealers who were wary that
recent gains on the New York Stock Exchange could easily be erased.
   As the London market closed, the Dow Jones industrial average
was losing ground, and stood 9.16 points lower at 2,924.25.
   However, London also was boosted by a healthy stock index
futures market, dealers said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 34.7
points, or 1.5 percent, to close at 2,405.4.
   The index rose as high as 39.6 points above Tuesday's close and
as low as 19.4 points.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 32.2 points at 1,933.2
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 17.6 points
to close at 1,299.59.
   Volume was an active 611.2 million shares, up from 433.7 million

<HEAD>Resurrecting Black Entrepreneurship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chinese laundry, the Italian produce stand,
the Jewish delicatessen, the Irish bar are old cliches of American
life. More recently, the Korean greengrocer has joined the list.
   Aspiring to business ownership, to be one's own boss, to be
independent, to control one's destiny, to create a future for one's
family all are deeply rooted in the American ethic.
   But what happened to black entrepreneurship?
   Blacks and Hispanics make up nearly 20 percent of the
population, but they own less than 5 percent of the country's small
businesses, and many of them are extremely small.
   But a report by the Business-Higher Education Forum, made up of
chief executives of major American colleges, universities and
corporations, suggests the opportunity for minority entrepreneurs
now ``may be better than at any time since the turn of the
century.''
   They view the racial climate as having changed sufficiently, and
the economic climate as now favoring small-businesses that can
adapt to quickly changing markets. Meanwhile, the black
middle-class market has swelled.
   Throughout the 87-page report, however, it becomes clear that
still another factor might be at work: a new sense of urgency by
the establishment, educators and executives included, that black
entrepreneurship should get a helping hand.
   In tracing the history of black enterpreneurship, the report
cites the work of Bart Landry, a Stanford University sociologist,
who describes the existence of black-owned enterprises even before
the Emancipation.
   After the Civil War such businesses flourished, the report
states.
   ``Building on skills acquired during slavery, black
entrepreneurs worked metal, repair harness and leathergoods,
managed hotels and rooming houses, catered and operated grocery
stores.''
   But, it states, ``these enterprises were almost completely
obliterated during the Reconstruction,'' or the period of economic
and governmental rebuilding after the Civil War.
   Still, when the Fourth Atlanta University Conference on ``The
Negro In Business'' met in 1898, more than 1,900 black businessmen
participated. And two years later, Booker T. Washington founded the
National Business League.
   But, the report relates, ``thrift and individual enterprise were
weak reeds on which to rely in the year 1900.'' Black-owned
business encountered selective white racism. And the North
industrialized, while the South was held back.
   Only certain enterprises remained open to blacks. The report
describes how ``Black business owners cut hair, provided meals,
cleaned and pressed clothes, and buried the dead.'' All required
little capital.
   Now, almost a century later, the Forum _ which many people will
identify as the establishment _ believe the causes of the problem
and its solution is clear. Minority business problems, it says, are
often:
   ``...problems of access to financial institutions and to
community networks that might provide financing to begin a
business, finance an initial inventory, andf obtain equipment and
space.''
   Many ethnic minorities avoided some degree of these problems,
even financial ones, because of strong family and community
structures, and because of institutions brought from the old
country. Blacks have not always had them.
   The Forum makes many important recommendations in educational
and business areas, few of which seem more important than in the
area of capital development.
   In particular, it suggests that corporations investigate three
related strategies of capital assistance:
   1. Creating partnerships with local banks and community
developoment groups to bring business back to the inner city.
   2. Depositing a small percentage of corporate assets in the
banks that form the cornerstone of these venture, to be available
for mortgage and business loans.
   3. Investing for profit directly in the venture capital efforts
of community development efforts.
   Every little bit will help, according to the report, signed by
task force co-chairmen Steven Mason of The Mead Corporation and
Clifton Wharton of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association.
   Indeed it might take very little.
   The report stresses ``that investing a very small amount of the
capital controlled by major corporations _ a fraction of one
percent _ can exert an enormous force for good in supporting these
community based organizations.''

   A Boeing 767 set an unofficial world distance
record for twin-engine commercial airliners by flying 9,253 miles
non-stop from Seattle to Nairobi, Kenya, the Boeing Commercial
Airplane Group said.
   The flight by a new 767-200ER was completed Sunday and lasted 18
hours, 29 minutes, Boeing said Tuesday.
   The plane was on the first part of a flight to the island of
Borneo to deliver the airliner to the Royal Brunei Airlines, the
national carrier of Brunei.
   There were 20 passengers aboard and a crew of four. The
aircraft, the first Boeing 767 for Royal Brunei's fleet, continued
to Brunei on Monday.
   Pending final verification, the National Aeronautic Association
established the flight as a record, Boeing said. The previous
record of 8,893 miles also was set by a 767.
   The 767-200ER model can seat 216 passengers and is designed to
fly extra-long routes.

   Dick Tracy, the comic book detective with a two-way
wrist radio, would be pleased.
   A Japanese company says it plans to introduce a wristwatch with
a pager capable of carrying short messages on a liquid-crystal
display.
   The Seiko Receptor, which took four years to develop, is
scheduled to debut next month in Portland, Ore., at an introductory
price of $255 and may gradually appear in other U.S. cities for
$275, Hattori Seiko Co. spokeswoman Noriko Kuriyama said Wednesday.
   The company also is studying plans to expand sales to Europe and
Asia, she said.
   Like Tracy's famous radio, the new wristwatch pager receives
radio signals. The Receptor translates the radio waves into written
messages up to 16 characters long. Many U.S. pager companies
already provide similar services for beepers, but these devices
aren't contained in a wristwatch.
   The wristwatch pager is manufactured by Seiko Epson Co., a
Hattori Seiko subsidiary. It can store up to eight messages.
   The Receptor will be marketed in the United States through AT&amp;E
Corp., a San Francisco-based telecommunications company.
   In 1983, Seiko introduced a wristwatch-sized color television.
But the TV required an auxiliary tuner about the size of a small
cassette tape player.
   Seiko hopes to sell 1 million wristwatch pagers in the next
three years, Ms. Kuriyama said.
   The Seiko model will have competition from a wristwatch pager
that Motorola Inc. and Timex Corp. expect to introduce later this
year. That model was announced last year by the two companies.

<HEAD>Computer Company Announces Deals With Eastern Europe, Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Control Data Corp. has announced a $9
million letter of intent by Poland to buy a computerized energy
management system.
   The computer company also disclosed further details of a
technology cooperation agreement it signed with the Soviet Union
when Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited the company June
3. In addition, it announced plans to install five small mainframe
computers in East Germany beginning next month.
   The system being ordered by the Poles is expected to be financed
by the World Bank, the company said. Under new export restrictions
agreed to by the United States and its allies in Paris last week,
the sale many not require an export license, said Dieter Porzel,
vice president of Control Data's central Europe region.
   When Gorbachev visited the company, Control Data said it hoped
to work out a joint venture to help the Soviets build their own
computer workstations. On Tuesday, Jim Ousley, president of the
company's computer products group, expanded on the technology
agreement that includes that effort.
   The agreement calls for pilot projects in civilian nuclear
reactor safety, petroleum exploration, electrical energy management
and software development. But it calls for no further specific
computer sales to the Soviet Union.
   Control Data is expecting to receive export approval soon for a
six-computer, $32 million sale to the Soviets for nuclear power
safety and already has U.S. approval for the sale of three smaller
mainframes for oil exploration for $6 million.
   The East German deal calls for the installation of mainframes at
five universities and government agencies in partnerships with
existing West German customers.

<HEAD>U.S. Government Urging Quick Action on Tightened Export Controls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUD S. BEELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. has asked West Germany to
speed work on measures designed to tighten export controls, a top
aide to Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Wednesday.
   Allegations that a West German company helped outfit a factory
in Rabta, Libya, to make poison gas prompted the legislation.
   U.S. Ambassador Vernon Walters sent a letter June 8 to West
German Finance Minister Helmut Haussmann urging Parliament to pass
the laws before the summer recess begins in late June, said Kohl
aide Lutz Stavenhagen.
   The measures would increase sentences for violations, broaden
the list of materials for which shippers must obtain government
approval and reduce the number of countries that could receive
sensitive exports without government approval.
   Stavenhagen appealed to Parliament to approve the proposed
measures, despite calls by the opposition for even tighter
restrictions.
   Stavenhagen said the proposed German measures were linked to
Washington's good will regarding easing Cocom export restrictions
on certain products for Eastern Europe, including East Germany.
   Cocom, or the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export
Controls, agreed in Paris last week to ease restrictions on what
goods could be exported to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   A U.S. Embassy official confirmed Walters had sent a letter to
Haussmann, but called it ``very straightforward'' and denied there
was any suggestion of quid pro quo between the Cocom decision and
passage of the proposed new West German export laws.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
United States wanted quick passage because ``we're hoping to be
able to stop the proliferation of dangerous technology,'' and
because it feared the proposed laws could get bogged down in
committee over opposition demands.
   The two Germanys are moving toward economic merger next month.
The eased Cocom regulations will allow countries' access to
previously restricted products such as machine tools,
telecommunications or computer equipment that could help revitalize
their economies.

<HEAD>Corn Futures Sink On Profit-Taking After Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn futures prices fell steeply Wednesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade amid profit-taking after a government report
confirmed perceptions of a shrinking national corn stockpile.
   Most other grain and soybean futures finished slightly lower
after hovering near unchanged for most of the session.
   In a report released after the close of trading Tuesday, the
Agriculture Department raised its estimate of corn exports for the
marketing year ending Aug. 31 by 50 million bushels and accordingly
lowered its projection for the corn stockpile next September by 50
million to 1.28 billion bushels.
   Traders had anticipated the revision and took profits after the
report confirmed their expectations, analysts said.
   ``The market made some very steep gains in the past week and
some people made some very nice profits,'' said Katharina Zimmer,
grains analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.
   Corn for near-term delivery rose 14 cents a bushel in the week
prior to the report, which also projected smaller soybean stocks
and a smaller winter wheat harvest than the May report.
   At the close, wheat futures were unchanged to 2 cents lower with
July at $3.34\ a bushel; corn was 1} cents to 4{ cents lower with
July at $2.90{ a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 2{ cents lower with
July at $1.43} a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to to 2 cents lower
with July at $6.06 a bushel.

   The dollar ended weaker Wednesday against most
major currencies after a mixed performance overseas, while the
soaring British pound continued to take center stage.
   Gold prices fell here and abroad.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $352 a troy ounce, down $3.70 from late
Tuesday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $351 an ounce, also $3.70 lower.
   Currency dealers blamed the dollar's decline largely on
technical factors, with traders selling the dollar to buy the West
German mark and Swiss franc.
   But they said the dollar also was depressed by an unexpected 0.7
percent decline in May retail sales, which suggested economic
growth was continuing to slow. The report sparked concern that the
Federal Reserve may be tempted to lower interest rates, making the
dollar less attractive to investors relative to other currencies,
dealers said.
   Three more indicators this week also may effect the dollar:
producer prices on Thursday and wholesale prices and trade figures
on Friday.
   Meanwhile, high interest rates and growing expectation that
Britain will join the European Monetary System later this year
continued to shore up sterling.
   The pound rose to a nearly four-month high against the dollar,
dealers said. It traded at $1.7070 in London, up from $1.7020
Tuesday, and at $1.7115 in New York, up from $1.7035.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.6865 West German marks, down from
1.6965; 1.4240 Swiss francs, down from 1.4382; 5.6720 French
francs, down from 5.7090; 1,238.00 Italian lire, down from
1,245.00; and 1.17195 Canadian dollars, down from 1.17255.
   Late European dollar rates, compared with Tuesday, included:
1.6925 West German marks, up from 1.6920; 1.4335 Swiss francs, down
from 1.4367; 5.6880 French francs, down from 5.6950; 1.9045 Dutch
guilders, unchanged; 1,241.00 Italian lire, down from 1,242.35; and
1.1722 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1713.
   Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 154.55 Japanese yen, up
from 154.40 Tuesday. It traded at 154.80 yen in London, and at
154.75 yen in New York, up from 154.55 yen the day before.
   Gold bullion prices in Europe and Asia declined. The late bid
price of gold in London was $350.15 an ounce, down from $356.25.
The Zurich late bid price was $350.50 an ounce, down from $355.65.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $353.45, down from $356.55.
   Silver prices also declined. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $4.915 a troy ounce, down from
$5.018. Silver fell in London to $4.95 an ounce from $5.06.

   The stock market posted a small loss Wednesday,
bogging down after a short-lived run toward record highs.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 10 points at
its best afternoon level, finished with a 3.47 loss at 2,929.95.
The average reached its closing peak of 2,935.19 on June 4.
   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 722 up, 786
down and 499 unchanged.
   The Commerce Department reported Wednesday morning that retail
sales fell 0.7 percent in May, registering a sharper decline than
most analysts had expected.
   That evidence of continued softness in business activity helped
push interest rates lower in the credit markets. Prices of
long-term government bonds rose about $7.50 for each $1,000 in face
value, lowering their yields to the 8.38 percent-8.41 percent range.
   But stock traders didn't show such clear-cut enthusiasm over the
news. Analysts said investors were a little unsettled by signs that
consumer spending was slipping at a time when economic growth
appears to be sluggish at best.
   In addition, traders appeared reluctant to chase after stocks in
advance of government reports Thursday and Friday on consumer and
producer prices.
   Among retailing stocks, Sears Roebuck was unchanged at 37; K
mart dropped &rsqb; to 36&rsqb;; J.C. Penney lost &rsqb; to 66, and Woolworth was
down } at 33}.
   Auto issues were fractionally lower after early-June figures for
domestic car sales came in below expectations. General Motors lost
\ to 50; Ford Motor \ to 46&rsqb;, and Chrysler &rsqb; to 15~.
   Prominent blue-chip gainers, by contrast, included Boeing, up ~
at 59}; International Business Machines, up 1&lsqb; at 121&rsqb;, and
American Express, up 1 at 31&rsqb;.
   HomeFed Corp. tumbled 8\ to 25. The company said its HomeFed
Bank subsidiary in San Diego, Calif., had an $81 million increase
in nonperforming assets during May.
   The news weighed down such other California savings and loan
issues as CalFed, down 1~ at 19{; Great Western Financial, down 1|
at 18~, and Golden West Financial, down 1~ at 31&rsqb;.
   Microsoft gained | to 76{ in the over-the-counter market.
Directors approved a continuation of a company stock-purchase

   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 158.91 million
shares, against 157.10 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 191.91 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $7.34 billion, or 0.21
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .66 to 199 even.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.16 to 426.16, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 1.35 at 364.90.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
2.30 to 469.86. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 365.04, up .73.

   Sales of North American-made cars and trucks
slipped 13.1 percent in early June, mainly because there were fewer
incentive packages in the period than during the same time last
year, automakers said Wednesday.
   The sales rate during June 1-10 last year wasn't particularly
strong, even though generous incentive packages initiated two
months earlier had been extended. This year, incentives covered
fewer cars and trucks, and rebates were lower.
   Incentives, used to reduce new-vehicle inventories, cut directly
into automakers' profits.
   Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade journal, said that at the end
of May, new-car inventories among the 10 major automakers with U.S.
plants stood at 59 selling days, considered good for this time of
year.
   ``The reason they are cutting back on incentives is that they
haven't overstocked the dealers,'' said economist Tom Webb of the
National Automobile Dealers Association in McLean, Va.
   But he said demand seemed to be softening beyond the falloff
caused by reduced incentives.
   The Commerce Department reported Wednesday a 0.7 percent drop in
retail sales in May, the third straight month of decline. Some
analysts interpreted the figure as an indication of sagging
consumer confidence.
   The automakers reported they sold vehicles at an average daily
rate of 30,412 during the early-June period this year, compared
with a rate of 34,994 during the same period last year.
   Car sales fell a 15.5 percent and truck sales were off 8.8
percent.
   Sales of the domestic cars made by General Motors Corp., Ford
Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. dropped 19.2 percent, while sales of
U.S.-made cars with Japanese company nameplates rose 34.8 percent.
The Big Three held 89.1 percent of the car market and the Japanese
``transplants'' held 10.9 percent.
   For the year so far, domestic car and truck sales were 4.4
percent behind last year's pace, with car sales down 5.6 percent
and truck sales down 2.2 percent. Big Three car sales tumbled 10.8
percent compared with last year and transplant car sales were up 42
percent.
   Chrysler's early-June overall sales were 18 percent lower than
last year's. Car sales dropped 16.7 percent and sales of light
trucks, which provide much of the company's profits, were off 19.1
percent. The company's vehicle sales so far this year declined 13
percent from last year.
   GM said its combined early-June car and truck sales were 16.7
percent behind last year's pace, with car sales down 19.2 percent
and sales of light trucks off 11.3 percent. So far this year, GM
has sold 4.8 percent fewer vehicles than last year.
   Ford reported a 12.4-percent drop in early-June car and truck
sales, with a 20.2-percent decline in car sales blunted by a
0.5-percent increase in truck sales. Ford spokesman Joel Pitcoff
credited sales of the company's new Explorer sport-utility vehicle
as the main reason for the increase.
   Since Jan. 1, Ford's vehicle sales are down 8.8 percent.

   Oil prices rebounded to post small gains
Wednesday on a report of OPEC production cuts after losing ground
earlier.
   The market started off downward based on bearish numbers from
the American Petroleum Institute, said Bob Baker, an oil analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   But prices came back to post modest gains by the close, with
many traders crediting a report on production by the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   The contract for July delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 7 cents to $17.58 a
42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercentile Exchange. The price had
risen 69 cents Tuesday. Longer contracts posted similar gains
Wednesday.
   The July contract had traded as low as $17.17 a barrel Wednesday
before the report. Crude reached a high of $17.74 before settling
into a more modest gain.
   ``When news broke of downward production by OPEC in the first
two weeks of the month _ it opened the floodgates for panic
buying,'' said James R. Fiedler, vice president in charge of energy
brokering at E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc. ``We're still
in a market with too much crude around. This market isn't ready for
$20.''
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the New York Merc,
wholesale unleaded gasoline for July delivery rose 0.35 cent a
gallon to 58.85 cents. The contract had risen 2.62 cents the day
before. Subsequent months gained similar amounts.
   The July contract for wholesale home heating oil, which rose
1.57 cents Tuesday, increased 0.28 cent to close at 48.57 cents a
gallon.
   Prices for natural gas were lower, with the July contract
falling to $1.545 per 1,000 cubic feet from $1.558 Tuesday.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First World Cheese Inc., with the help of the
``21'' club's chef, introduced a line of fat-free, low-cholesterol
cheese Wednesday described as the first of its kind to begin
national distribution.
   The small but fast-growing firm hopes to expand on the success
of its low-salt and low-cholesterol cheeses sold under the Pre
Monde Alpine Lace label.
   ``We feel there is a small segment of the population who gave up
cheese and dairy products due to health concerns,'' said Carl Wolf,
First World's president and chief executive officer. ``The consumer
is ready for this.''
   Alpine Lace Lean N' Free cheeses will appeal to nutrition-minded
consumers keen to trim fat from their diets, Wolf said in remarks
before lunch was served at the famous Manhattan restaurant.
   The menu featured dishes prepared with the fat-free cheese by
the ``21'' club's executive chef, Michael Lomonaco. The meal, from
the Cheddar corn chowder to the Cheddar stuffed peppers
accompanying the main course, drew favorable comments from diners.
However, when eaten uncooked, the cheeses lack the full flavor of
their fatty cousins.
   The new cheeses will be widely available in grocery stores
around the country by July in American, Cheddar and mozzarella
varieties. Prices will range from $1.89 for packages of shredded
cheese to $4.99 per pound at the delicatessen counter.
   The existing Alpine Lace brands are carried in about 30,000
retail outlets nationwide. According to Wolf, Alpine Lace is the
best-selling cheese brand at the country's delis.
   All three new varieties have about 35 calories in a one-ounce
serving. They contain less than 0.5 gram of fat per serving
compared with about six to nine grams in traditional cheeses. A
serving has about 5 milligrams of cholesterol vs. about 20 to 30
milligrams for regular American, Cheddar and mozzarella.
   Aly Gamay, who holds a doctorate in food science, developed the
fat-free cheese over years of trial and error working independently
at a company he founded.
   He told reporters that most skim milk cheeses taste like
cardboard and thousands of his early formulations were no exception.
   Gamay, an Egyptian native who came to the United States 11 years
ago, said his wife sampled all his experiments and after thousands
of taste tests screamed: ``Enough. Enough. I can't take it
anymore!''
   Finally, Gamay said he arrived at a process that produced a
tasty but lean cheese, using skim milk cheese as a base. The
addition of enzymes and flavorings compensate for the absence of
fat, giving the cheese the smoothness and mouth feel that people
expect.
   Gamay's creation was test marketed under the Cheese Smart name
in Detroit, Charlotte, N.C., and Detroit. Sales were strong, he
said.
   First World bought Gamay's cheese technology, including three
pending patents and Cheese Smart, in May. Gamay said he will act as
a consultant to First World and help develop new products.
   Wolf said First World eventually will bring out additional
cheese varieties, such as brie and Gorgonzola, in fat-free versions.
   First World hopes to carve out a big slice of the growing market
for so-called nutritional cheeses, now running about $550 million a
year at retail. Wolf said retail sales of these reduced calorie,
fat and cholesterol cheeses could grow to about $4 billion by the
mid-1990s.
   By being the first to roll out its cheese nationally, the
Maplewood, N.J.-based company has an advantage over its larger
competitors, who food industry analysts say are developing fat-free
cheeses. Philip Morris Cos. Inc.'s Kraft division has been testing
such a cheese in Phoenix, analysts said.
   How does a food professional rate the taste and cooking
properties of the new cheese?
   Chef Lomonaco said it was easier to bake it into recipes than to
broil it. It worked well in soups, muffins and even souffles, and
would make an excellent sauce, he said.
   As for taste, Lomonaco said it's unrealistic to expect fat-free
cheese to taste like its traditional counterpart. It has its own
unique good taste, he said.

<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices flirted with $350 an ounce Wednesday,
dropping to within 50 cents of that psychologically important level
before rebounding to $352, the lowest daily settlement on New
York's Commodity Exchange in nearly four years.
   Silver futures also fell sharply in New York, reflecting
investor preference for stocks and bonds over precious metals,
analysts said.
   On other commodity markets, grains and soybeans retreated; oil
futures rose; and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $3.70 to $4.90 lower with the contract for
delivery in June down $3.70 at $352 a troy ounce, the lowest
settlement of a Comex gold contract since July 30, 1986; silver
finished 10.3 cents to 13.1 cents lower with June at $4.915 a troy
ounce, the lowest silver futures price since May 19, 1986.
   The more actively traded July silver contract finished at $4.933
an ounce.
   Don Tierney, an analyst with the commodities brokerage Stanley
Bell &amp; Co., traced gold's decline to expectations that the 10 a.m.
EDT closing gold price fix from London would come in at $350 or
lower following heavy Middle Eastern selling of bullion just prior
to the London close.
   Instead, London dealers fixed their closing price at $350.50,
which eased selling pressure in New York, he said.
   ``The magic psychological level held, at least for today,''
Tierney said. He added, though, that the gold market still looked
weak from a technical standpoint.
   A move below $350 an ounce probably would spark further selling,
possibly pressing gold's price as low as $335 or even $320 before
significant buying surfaces, said Bernard Savaiko, senior metals
analyst with PaineWebber Inc.
   Savaiko said strong bond and stock markets are ``siphoning
investor interest away from the metals.''
   ``As long as you have strong interest in paper assets, you're
going to have gold sagging as investors forego precious metals or
sell them,'' he said.
   In other trading, corn futures fell steeply on the Chicago Board
of Trade amid profit-taking after a government report confirmed
perceptions of a shrinking national corn stockpile.
   Most other grain and soybean futures finished slightly lower
after hovering near unchanged for most of the session.
   In a report released after the close of trading Tuesday, the
Agriculture Department raised its estimate of corn exports for the
marketing year ending Aug. 31 by 50 million bushels and accordingly
lowered its projection for the corn stockpile next September by 50
million bushels to 1.28 billion bushels.
   Wheat futures settled unchanged to 2 cents lower with July at
$3.34\ a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 4{ cents lower with July at
$2.90\ a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2\ cents lower with July at
$1.43} a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents lower to 2 cents higher with
July at $6.06 a bushel.
   Energy futures rallied late in the session on the New York
Mercantile Exchange following news that the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries had trimmed crude-oil production by
700,000 barrels per day to 22.9 million during the first two weeks
of June.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 12 cents
higher with July at $17.58 a barrel; heating oil was .20 cent to
.50 cent higher with July at 48.57 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .30 cent to .57 cent higher with July at 58.85 cents a
gallon.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures rallied
moderately amid market talk that top steer prices in the Texas
panhandle and western Kansas rose 50 cents to 77.50 cents a pound.
   Pork futures were mixed as weaker cash prices for pork products
offset gains in the cash hog market.
   Live cattle futures finished .10 cent lower to .57 cent higher
with June at 76.77 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to
.18 cent higher with August at 84.97 cents a pound; live hogs were
.40 cent lower to .05 cent higher with June at 64.17 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .05 cent lower to .10 cent higher with
July at 70.45 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Worried About Paying Your Bills? You're Not Alone, Survey Says</HEAD>

   Americans are increasingly worried about their
ability to pay their long-term bills and, as far as their
pocketbooks, view the 1990s with pessimism, according to a survey
to be released Thursday.
   Especially anxious about money are the nation's baby boomers,
according to the study conducted by the Gallup Organization for the
Atlanta-based International Association for Financial Planners.
   The survey results confirmed concerns financial planners have
seen developing over the last few years, said Robert A. Hewitt,
chairman of the IAFP.
   According to the survey, 46 percent of the respondents expressed
worry about their ability to meet all of their financial
responsibilities and 52 percent said they were concerned about
outliving their retirement savings.
   But among those between the ages of 35 and 44, 59 percent were
worried about their ability to meet financial responsibilities and
62 percent were concerned about outliving their savings, the survey
said.
   Eighty-six percent of the all respondents said college costs
have risen beyond the reach of most American families, and 86
percent said they believe severe inflation is likely to be a
problem in this decade.
   Because of these type of concerns, the survey said, 61 percent
of the overall respondents said they were less inclined to take
financial risks than during the 1980s.
   The survey, conducted in April among 1,058 households in a
random sample and an additional 600 with incomes of at least
$50,000, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent.
   Hewitt called the 35-44 age group ``triple squeeze boomers''
because they are increasingly having to deal with the costs of
raising children and taking care of their aging parents, as well as
tending to their own needs.
   ``All of a sudden they have this discretionary income and
discover, `Gosh, I'm going to have to pay for college for little
Johnny,''' Hewitt said.

<HEAD>Mulheren Denies Illegal Stock Deal with Boesky</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John A. Mulheren Jr. took the stand at his
securities fraud trial Wednesday and denied making an illegal stock
``parking'' transaction with Ivan Boesky.
   Mulheren, a former business associate of Boesky, said he balked
when Boesky's chief trader, Michael Davidoff, said Boesky wanted to
sell 330,000 shares of Unocal Corp. stock in 1985 with an agreement
to buy it back at a later date.
   Mulheren said he told Davidoff: ``You can stop right there. I
don't do those trades.''
   Mulheren also described his first meeting with Boesky in 1976 at
a dinner at an expensive Manhattan restaurant dinner, which had
been arranged by stock speculator Sandy Lewis. He said Boesky
ordered six to eight entrees and decided which one to eat after
they arrived at the table.
   ``He seemed like someone out of a movie,'' Mulheren said. ``He
seemed to be very smart, a little outlandish.''
   Boesky, once one of Wall Street's most powerful stock
speculators, paid $100 million in penalties and pleaded guilty to
one felony to settle Wall Street's biggest insider trading case
ever. In exchange, he gave government investigators incriminating
information about a number of his associates.
   Mulheren, 40, is charged with 41 counts of conspiracy,
securities fraud, mail fraud and record-keeping violations
involving his friendship with Boesky.
   He is accused of scheming with Boesky to manipulate the stock
price of Gulf &amp; Western Inc. and concealing the ownership of other
stocks, including Unocal, to help Boesky cheat on his taxes and
evade federal securities laws.
   Mulheren said he bought the Unocal shares after his discussion
with Davidoff, and sold them on the open market at a loss about
three weeks later.
   He said he had never agreed to sell the securities back to
Boesky or Davidoff. His account of the transaction contradicts
previous testimony by key prosecution witnesses, including Boesky
and Davidoff.
   Mulheren, who was known as a daring trader who wore jeans to the
office, carried over his casual style to the witness stand. He wore
an open-necked shirt, sports pants and topsiders with no socks, and
often answered questions by his attorney, Thomas Puccio, by saying
``yeah.''
   Puccio also elicited from Mulheren that he has been diagnosed as
manic-depressive and has taken the prescribed drug lithium as
treatment.
   Prosecutors objected to the testimony, but U.S. District Judge
Miriam Cedarbaum allowed it as long as Puccio did not use it to
argue that the illness may have affected Mulheren's judgement.
   In February 1988, police arrested Mulheren leaving his Rumson,
N.J., mansion with a loaded assault rifle. According to court
documents, Mulheren intended to shoot Boesky because of his
cooperation with prosecutors.
   Mulheren's doctors later said the episode happened because
Mulheren had stopped taking lithium. New Jersey authorities dropped
weapons possession charges in exchange for three years of probation.
   Mulheren was expected to continue his testimony Thursday.

<HEAD>HomeFed Reports New Soured Loans, Foreclosed Property; More
Expected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Raising a new red flag over California's
thrift industry, HomeFed Bank said its bad loans and foreclosed
properties rose by $81 million in May.
   HomeFed reported similar news in April, and on Tuesday it said
more problems are likely in coming months, mainly because of
out-of-state loans.
   HomeFed is the chief subsidiary of San Diego-based HomeFed Corp.
and California's seventh-biggest thrift.
   Non-performing assets now total $579 million, or 3.1 percent of
its $18 billion in assets. Bad loans rose $72 million to $315
million in May; foreclosed real estate by $9 million to $264
million.
   HomeFed reported a $44 million increase in non-performing assets
in April, mainly because of loans on a Florida apartment complex.
   Robert F. Adelizzi, HomeFed's chief executive, said the biggest
problem in May was a default on $54 million in loans on California
commercial property. The loans, to an individual Adelizzi declined
to name, already had been restructured, he said.
   ``It is not indicative of any weakness in the California
economy, although it's pretty clear that certain portions of
commercial market are problems in California as well as
nationwide,'' Adelizzi said in a telephone interview.
   In spite of the state's strong economy, California's S&amp;Ls have
racked up some big losses in the past few years, with out-of-state
lending and junk bonds at the top of the list of bad investments.
   Adelizzi said HomeFed had been making headway in paring its
level of bad loans and foreclosures, which peaked at $592 million
in September 1989.
   But the last two months' results, combined with weakness in
commercial markets nationwide and apartment markets outside
California, have tainted the outlook, he said.
   ``It is probable that the level of non-performing assets will
increase further in June and our goal of reducing these assets
below $400 million by year-end 1990 will be extremely difficult to
achieve,'' Adelizzi said.
   All big loans at HomeFed are under a special review. He
suggested there may be more problems, particularly with
out-of-state loans, saying another $140 million in loans are 30
days or more overdue. Loans are classified as non-accrual, or bad,
when they are 90 days overdue.
   Campbell Chaney, a thrift analyst with Sutro &amp; Co. in San
Francisco, said the disclosures raise questions about all of
California's banks and S&amp;Ls, particularly those with out of state
loans.
   ``I think what it tells me is that California is not infallible,
despite what people say about how well its economy is doing and its
insulation,'' Chaney said.

   The former owner of Vernon Savings &amp; Loan, accused
of illegally using bank funds to raise money for Jim Wright, was
indicted Wednesday on bank fraud charges in the collapse of his
thrift three years ago.
   A 38-count indictment was handed up by a federal grand jury
accusing Don Dixon of conspiracy, misapplication of funds, making
false statements and false entries, and interstate travel in aid of
racketeering.
   Five other former officials of the defunct thrift have pleaded
guilty to various crimes. Former president Patrick G. King and
former chairman Woody F. Lemons have been sentenced to prison for
their part in the thrift's collapse, which cost the government $1.3
billion, authorities said.
   Government attorneys have pointed to the thrift's collapse as a
prime example of abuse in the savings and loan industry.
   Wednesday's indictment is the most significant case developed by
savings and loans investigators in the Dallas area, said U.S.
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   ``These complicated, white-collar crime cases take time to
develop, but the Justice Department is committed to the
investigation, prosecution and incarceration of those who ripped
off our financial institutions and have left the taxpayers of the
United States holding the bag,'' Thornburgh said in a statement.
   U.S. Attorney Marvin Collins said the 3{ years it took to indict
Dixon is typical for savings and loans cases.
   Dixon is scheduled to surrender himself to federal authorities
on Thursday, Collins said.
   The indictment alleges that Dixon conspired with other Vernon
officials to use savings and loan funds to make illegal political
contributions to 13 candidates, including Wright, the former House
Speaker and Texas Democrat, and then-Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y.
   The indictment said Dixon encouraged employees to make political
contributions and then reimbursed them with expense money or phony
bonuses. Prosecutors have said the candidates did not know the
contributions were illegal.
   Wright was not named as a defendant in the indictment. An
administrative assistant in Fort Worth said Wright was unavailable
for comment.
   Dixon also misapplied funds for pleasure trips for Vernon
officials, the indictment said.
   If convicted of all the charges, Dixon faces 190 years in prison
and a fine of up to $9.5 million dollars. His attorney, William
Ravkind, did not immediately return a phone call to The Associated
Press on Wednesday.
   Former thrift executive vice president Patrick Malone testified
in King's 1989 trial that he solicited contributions from King and
other top thrift executives for the 1986 gubernatorial primary
campaign of former Rep. Tom Loeffler, R-Texas, and the re-election
bids of Wright, who resigned after a House Ethics committee
investigation; Kemp, now secretary of Housing and Urban
Development; Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah; and Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif.
   Dixon threw parties for other S&amp;L operators aboard his yacht
``High Spirits'' when it was docked on the Potomac River in
Washington to raise money for the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, chaired by then-Rep. Tony Coehlo, D-Calif.
   At Coehlo's request, Wright intervened with federal thrift
regulators to determine if there were any plans to shut down Vernon
Savings and Loan, according to a report to the House Ethics
Committee by the outside counsel hired to investigate Wright.
   In December 1986, Coehlo told an aide to Wright, John Mack, that
regulators were going to shut down Vernon, and asked if the speaker
could get the thrift a grace period, according to the report by
Richard J. Phelan, the ethics panel's outside counsel.
   Phelan reported that Wright telephoned Edwin Gray, the chairman
of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and asked if Vernon were going
to be shut down.
   Gray told Wright he did not know, but later told Mack that the
bank board would seek to merge it with another financial
institution, according to Phelan's report.
   Wright told the ethics panel he did not know Dixon. But Phelan's
investigation produced a picture of Wright and Dixon aboard the
yacht. The photograph bore the inscription ``My best personal
regards, Jim Wright.''
   Phelan concluded that ``it is clear that Wright was willing to
intervene on Dixon's behalf without even performing a rudimentary
investigation of Dixon's dispute with the Bank Board or the
legitimacy of his request.''
   The ethics panel overruled Phelan's recommendation that it
discipline Wright over the episode.
   Dixon was the lead defendant in a $540 million federal fraud
lawsuit brought after the Vernon shutdown but had never faced
criminal charges in the case until Wednesday.
   The lawsuit alleged that Dixon and other thrift officers
fraudulently caused Vernon to grossly overstate its profits and net
worth in order to pay $22.1 million in illegal dividends to Dondi
Financial Corp., a holding company headed by Dixon.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. lawsuit said top
officials ``began to loot Vernon for their personal financial
benefit and defraud its depositors, creditors and the FSLIC.''
   Under Dixon, who moved the thrift to Dallas from its home in the
north Texas town of Vernon, Vernon assets grew tenfold until 1987
when federal regulators shut it down.
   When regulators seized Vernon, they found it owned 17th Century
castle doors, various expensive art objects and even a
silver-studded saddle purchased by Dixon on various shopping trips.

<HEAD>SEC Seeks Public Comment on Overhauling Investment Companies Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission wants
to know if the laws governing mutual funds and other investment
companies should be overhauled _ and if so how.
   The SEC, which regulates stocks, bonds and the exchanges that
trade in them, voted unanimously Wednesday to seek public comment
on updating regulation of investment companies.
   The last significant amendments to those regulations were made
in 1970.
   Investment companies manage pooled funds of small investors'
money for a fee. Some, like mutual funds, are open-ended. Investors
can buy into or sell out of these funds when they wish, and
depending on those investment flows, the funds' managers buy or
sell stocks and bonds.
   Others are closed-end funds, such as investment trusts. These
funds have an investment pool of a fixed size and issue shares
backed by that pool that can be traded like a corporation's.
   The commission voted to ask for public comment on several topics
including the internationalization of the securities markets,
distribution of open-end companies, closed-end funds and
repurchases of shares. It also asks the public to put in its own
two cents about what changes should be made.
   In other matters, the SEC voted to seek public comment on
proposed rules that would:
   _ close a loophole in the Investment Company Act of 1940 and
require investment companies dealing in foreign securities to
either maintain records in English or at least in the United States;
   _ allow investment companies to save time and money by sending
out summary prospectuses initially to investors, who would then
request the entire prospectus _ often numbering a hundred or more
pages _ if they were interested.

<TEXT>
   The Senate voted Wednesday to restrict logging
and set aside 673,000 acres as a protected area in Alaska's huge
Tongass National Forest.
   The bill would modify two long-term harvesting contracts to
protect old growth timber and end a $40 million annual incentive to
high levels of harvesting.
   The unanimous vote came after senators set aside a disputed
amendment that would have required the U.S. Forest Service to trade
mining rights in the Greens Creek area of Admiralty Island in
southeastern Alaska.
   The exchange with the native-Alaskan owned Sealaska Corp. would
have given the government other mining rights and land, including
the last 6,000 acres of old-growth timber on Admiralty Island.
   Under an agreement worked out among senators, the secretary of
agriculture will try to speed up negotiations on a voluntary land
and mining-rights trade. Also, the Senate Energy and Commerce
Committee will hold hearings beginning June 28 to find out if the
items to be traded are of comparable value.
   Backers say the overall bill is necessary to protect the
16.7-million-acre forest, which is larger than West Virginia. The
forest is one of the few remaining temperate rain forests in the
world.
   The old-growth portions host large concentrations of bald eagles
and grizzly bears. The forest also is home to valuable salmon
spawning grounds.
   Critics said changes will cost jobs in the timber-dependent
local economy. But they say they prefer the Senate version to the
stricter version adopted by the House almost a year ago.
   Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper said Wednesday the Senate bill was a
''balanced solution,'' and described himself as especially pleased
with a provision for no-logging buffer strips along fish-bearing
streams.
   ``This is a national forest, not a national park,'' said Sen.
Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, when debate began Tuesday. ``People live and
work in this forest and a good number of them, almost 3,400 people,
make their living solely from cutting and processing the trees that
are harvested in the Tongass.
   ``Their interests should be balanced against the desire to leave
this forest uncut.''
   Wednesday's debate centered on an amendment by Sen. Jake Garn,
R-Utah, to give Sealaska, owned by descendants of Alaska's original
inhabitants, mining rights to 18,000 acres at Greens Creek.
   In exchange, the Forest Service would have received mining
rights to 10,000 acres on Admiralty along with 1,860 acres of
surface lands and 10 percent of Sealaska's income from the mining
venture.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, tried to block the amendment,
saying the government might be giving away rights to land rich in
silver, gold, lead and zinc. He said the real beneficiaries would
be mining companies, such as Kennecott in Garn's home state, which
run a successful mine for Sealaska within Greens Creek.
   Metzenbaum called the 18,000 acres the ``donut'' around a highly
profitable hole, the existing mine.
   ``Let's not tie up Tongass reform with this giveaway,''
Metzenbaum said.
   An amendment on the exchange will be taken up again when House
and Senate negotiators work on a compromise.
   The bill would leave 1.4 million acres or about 8 percent of the
total forest available for logging, rather than the current 1.7
million acres, about 10 percent.
   The House bill would cancel rather than modify the 50-year
contracts the government has with Alaska Pulp Co. and Louisiana
Pacific-Ketchikan.
   Critics say the two companies have monopolized timber and
violated antitrust and labor laws. They say canceling the 50-year
sweetheart deals would open the area to competition from other
firms.
   The Senate bill would:
   _Delete a $40 million appropriation for road-building and other
timber sale preparation activities.
   _End the requirement that the Forest Service provide for sale
4.5 billion board feet of Tongass timber each decade. Instead, the
service would be obligated to ``seek to meet market demand for
timber.''
   _Protect hundreds of thousands of more acres of land from
logging, including ``buffer zones'' along streams.

   Sorting out responsibility and liability for
the oil tanker explosion off the Texas coast illustrates the
problems of policing a global industry.
   The Norwegian owned and registered Mega Borg was staffed by
Indians and chartered by a French oil company to carry crude from
Angola to the United States for processing.
   The series of explosions that ripped the 886-foot tanker early
Saturday focused attention on U.S. legislation to improve oil
tanker safety, which has bogged down in a House-Senate conference
committee. The accident occurred as some of the Mega Borg's cargo
was being loaded onto another tanker in the Gulf of Mexico.
   But even if the pending oil tanker legislation became law, it
might not have any effect on accidents like that on board the Mega
Borg. Though the tanker is sitting less than 60 miles off the coast
of Texas, it is in international waters.
   That means the Borg's Norwegian owners may not be legally held
liable for any damage to the U.S. coastline. Lawsuits over such
liability and how far a country's jurisdiction extends sometimes
get held up for years. Suits over the 1979 Amoco Cadiz spill off
the French coast are still mired in courts.
   The U.S. legislation, crafted after last year's Exxon Valdez
accident in Alaska, includes a provision requiring U.S. tankers to
have double hulls to prevent spills. But some House factions want
to exempt the huge tankers that unload cargo offshore onto smaller
vessels, a procedure used at nearly every U.S. oil port.
   Also, any U.S. legislation will be effective only in the United
States and its waters. Unlike the airline industry, which is
subject to regulations recognized around the world, the shipping
business isn't scrutinized by central government agencies.
   ``The shipping industry, in general, is not many people's top
priority in terms of Capitol Hill and other places,'' said Paul
Henning, a spokesman for OMI Corp., an independent tanker owner in
New York. ``It's difficult to get attention focused on issues at
times because of that.''
   As the fire raged on the Mega Borg Monday, one of the world's
oil giants, Royal Dutch Shell Group, announced that it would use
only one Louisiana port for all the crude oil it ships to the
United States in tankers it owns.
   The Louisiana Offsore Oil Port, an offshore terminal known as
the LOOP, is the oil terminal in the lower 48 states capable of
handling very large crude carriers.
   At other oil ports, supertanker cargoes must be transferred to
smaller ships _ the process that was underway when the Mega Borg
exploded. But at the Louisiana facility, big tankers can unload
without ever coming ashore.
   Shell said it took the action because of the liability risks.
``The Exxon Valdez made it clear what happens when you have a spill
and the enormous liabilities you can face,'' said Norm Altstedter,
a spokesman in New York for the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate.
   Following the Alaska spill, the nation's worst, Exxon was
indicted in February on five federal charges. They included
violating the Port and Waterways Safety Act, the Dangerous Cargo
Act, the Clean Water Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and
illegally discharging oil.
   Prosecutors said they would seek at least $700 million in
penalties from Exxon under a law that allows recovery of twice the
amount of proven losses.
   Though other oil companies are studying Shell's decision, the
initial impact appears to be negligible. The new policy does not
include any shipments by Shell Oil Co., the group's U.S.
subsidiary, or cargoes carried by tankers that Royal Dutch Shell
charters from other companies _ about 75 percent of its shipments
to the United States.
   Exxon Corp., which has been under fire for the Valdez accident,
``has no current plans'' to restrict the movements of its tankers,
spokesman Bill Smith said.
   Elf Aquitaine Petroleum Co., the French company that had
chartered the Mega Borg, is considering adopting a policy similar
to Shell's, said a spokesman in Houston who asked not to be
identified further.
   Some shipping insiders said they believed the Shell move was an
attempt to pressure Congress, which is considering the use of
international agreements to determine liability in a spill.
   Those agreements, which have not been ratified by the United
States, provide up to $260 million from an international
compensation fund to clean up a spill, according to House backers
of the measure.
   ``The U.S. has not yet ratified the international conventions,
which limit liability,'' said Altstedter, the Shell spokesman.
``And there's no limitation on liability.''
   Top Transportation Department officials, the head of the Coast
Guard and members of Congress from Texas urged Congress to
subscribe to the international limits, which is a chief point of
disagreement between the two houses over the pending legislation _
the House wants the limits; the Senate version of the bill would
let state law govern such situations.
   ``The House and the Senate have to reach agreement on this
legislation, and this nation is exposed until that is done,'' said
Transportation Secretary Samual Skinner.
   The commandant of the Coast Guard, Rear Adm. William Kime, said
the United States ``dodged the bullet'' in the Texas accident
because the owners of the Mega Borg were cooperating in the cleanup
and the investigation.

<HEAD>Hitachi and Hewlett-Packard Sign RISC Chip Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hewlett-Packard Co. and Hitachi Ltd.
announced a deal in which the Japanese electronics giant will make
and market RISC microprocessor chips based on the American
company's technology.
   Hitachi and Hewlett-Packard also will jointly introduce
development tools for the chip market and will share in H-P's
Precision Architecture RISC design information, the companies said
Wednesday.
   RISC _ reduced instruction set computing _ is a design that
increases the speed of chips by cutting down on the number of
functions they perform.
   Last July, the two companies agreed to develop jointly a new
higher-speed RISC chip set to be used in computer systems produced
by both companies.
   The new agreement strengthens the relationship and aims to
promote wide acceptance of Precision Architecture RISC.
   Hitachi said it expect to make the RISC chips commercially
available in the spring of 1991, and eventually will build a
product line ranging from several millions of instructions per
second to 100 or more MIPS.

<HEAD>U.S. Will Not Impose Sanctions Against India For Trade Barriers</HEAD>

   The Bush administration has decided not to
impose economic sanctions against India for its barriers to
American investment and sales by U.S. insurance companies, an
administration official said Wednesday.
   The official, speaking on condition that he not be named, said
the decision had been made to continue pressing for removal of the
barriers as part of global free-trade talks rather than imposing
economic retaliation now.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills met with India's new
ambassador to Washington, Abid Hussain, on Wednesday to inform him
of the action, sources said.
   The administration was facing a deadline of deciding by June 16
whether to boost tariffs on imports from India into the United
States or take some other form of trade retaliation because of
India's refusal to negotiate over the issue.
   The case against India involves that country's barriers to
foreign investment and its refusal to allow American insurance
companies to do business in the country.
   India was one of three countries placed on a trade ``hit list''
last year by the Bush administration for erecting the most
offensive trade barriers against American products.
   The other two countries, Japan and Brazil, both negotiated on
the issues which landed them on the list and reached agreements
with the United States to remove the offending barriers.
   However, India has refused to negotiate under threat of U.S.
sanctions which are provided by a section of the 1988 trade law
known as Super 301.
   While the decision removes the possibility of economic
retaliation for this year, the administration has already announced
that it was naming India for its offending trade barriers under a
second round of the Super 301 process that will not conclude until
June 1991.
   That decision, announced on April 27, triggered an avalanche of
criticism in Congress because of the administration's refusal to
cite Japan once again.
   The administration contended that Japan had negotiated in good
faith to remove barriers to sales of American satellites, super
computers and wood products in Japan.
   The administration also pledged to press forward with separate
discussions on broad-ranging structural trade barriers with Japan.
   However, there have been complaints in recent days that the
talks with Japan on structural impediments to trade had bogged
down. A final report on these talks is scheduled to be issued in
July.
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
accused Japan on Tuesday of ``stonewalling'' on the trade issue and
warned that his committee, which has jurisdiction over trade
matters, wold ``insist that more be done.''
   Sens. Max Baucus, D-Mont., Bob Packwood, R-Oregon, and John
Danforth, R-Mo., were even more blunt, writing a letter to Hills
warning that Congress ``may have no choice'' but to respond with
retaliatory legislation if Japan is not more forthcoming.
   The structural barriers talks are focusing on such various ways
the Japanese can make their economy more receptive to imports as
well as ways the United States can dampen its appetite for foreign
products.

   Credit woes hit the West Coast banking market
Wednesday as a leading rating agency downgraded Security Pacific
Corp. and Wells Fargo Corp., citing worries over loans for
takeovers and California commercial real estate.
   The action by Moody's Investors Service came just two days after
the agency downgraded the debt of Chase Manhattan, the nation's
second largest bank, because of concerns about real estate lending.
   In recent weeks, Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. have
lowered their ratings on Citicorp, the nation's biggest bank,
citing real estate and takeover loans.
   Moody's lowered its ratings on the long-term debt of Security
Pacific and Wells Fargo by one notch. The actions affected $3.2
billion in debt of Wells Fargo and its subsidiaries, and about $7.4
billion at Security Pacific.
   Even after the move, the debt has a solid investment-grade
rating.
   The actions drew protests from the two companies, whose main
subsidiaries, Security Pacific National Bank and Wells Fargo Bank,
are the second- and third-largest banks in California and among the
top ten in the nation.
   Moody's did not describe specific problem loans, but said ``the
California real estate market has only begun to soften.'' Both
companies may have to beef up reserves against possible loan losses
despite have diversified real estate portfolios and apparently
sound underwriting standards, Moody's said.
   Both companies also have substantial exposure to highly
leveraged transactions, Moody's said. Such transactions include
corporate buyouts and recapitalizations.
   ``We have maintained a well-balanced loan portfolio consistent
with the demands of the marketplace, and with adequate and
appropriate levels of reserves,'' Security Pacific Chief Executive
Robert H. Smith said in a statement.
   Leslie Altick, Wells Fargo senior vice president for investor
relations, said Wells Fargo was not convinced California real
estate is headed for new problems. Softness in the office building
and hotel markets is already well-documented, but Wells Fargo
believes California's underlying economy is too strong for a major
downturn to occur, she said.
   Moody's lowered its ratings on the two bank holding company's
senior debt to single-a1 from double-a3.
