   Charges were filed Tuesday against 41
alleged mobsters, including the son of jailed mafia boss ``Little
Nicky'' Scarfo, in a statewide sweep that authorities said signals
the end of the Scarfo era.
   Also charged was reputed DeCavalcante crime boss John Riggi and
alleged members of the Bruno-Scarfo, Gambino, Colombo, Luchese,
Genovese and DeCavalcante organized crime families.
   Twenty-nine of the defendants were arrested by Tuesday evening,
authorities said. They were arraigned before Superior Court Judge
Michael Degnan in Essex County.
   The charges listed in the criminal complaint will be presented
to a state grand jury.
   More than 150 state police fanned out across New Jersey early
Tuesday to make the arrests, which came after a year-long
investigation based on information from George Fresolone, a member
of the Bruno-Scarfo family, police said.
   Fresolone, who is now in hiding, secretly recorded more than 400
conversations with alleged mobsters and also recorded the
initiation ritual of five members into the mob, authorities said.
   Officials refused to release details about Fresolone, why he
became an informant, or whether he was being protected by police.
   But they said his tapes revealed how the mafia families
cooperated with each other and shared illicit profits.
   Although Nicodemo Scarfo Sr., known as ``Little Nicky,'' is
serving a 69-year federal sentence on murder and extortion charges,
authorities claim he ran a criminal empire from prison in Illinois
via his son, Nicodemo Scarfo Jr., 25.
   ``The Scarfo organization is in a state of disarray,'' said Col.
Justin Dintino, a spokesman for the state police. ``It's been
greatly weakened by previous indictments, arrests and killings
within the organization.
   ``If the individuals arrested today ... are convicted, I believe
that the final nail in the Scarfo organized crime organization has
been placed,'' he said.
   Besides Riggi and Scarfo Jr., among those apprehended were
Anthony ``Tony Buck'' Piccolo, 67, of Collingswood and Joseph
``Scoops'' Licata, 48, of Florham Park, allegedly top advisers to
the elder Scarfo.
   Riggi was released on $100,000 bail Tuesday, but Scarfo Jr.,
Piccolo and Licata remained in the Essex County Jail. Bail was set
at $100,000 each for Scarfo and Piccolo and $150,000 for Licati.
   Piccolo and Licata were charged with racketeering and leading
organized crime.
   Licata, who also was charged with illegal gambling and theft by
extortion, operated loansharking, bookmaking and extortion
activities from the East Side Social Club in Newark, the criminal
complaint alleged.
   Riggi, 65, of Elizabeth, was charged with similar offenses, as
well as witness tampering, bribery and hindering apprehension, and
Scarfo Jr., of Scotch Plains, was charged with promoting gambling
and racketeering.
   The other defendants were charged with various offenses
including conspiracy, racketeering and drug distribution.
   Riggi was convicted last month of extortion and violating
federal labor laws and faces up to 65 years in prison.
   John Mavilla, 43, a member of the Newark Zoning Board, was
charged with bribery and official misconduct. He is accused of
taking a $2,000 bribe from an allegedly mob-controlled hauling
company to approve a use variance.
   Fresolone tape-recorded conversations from August 1989 until
late this summer, when he was initiated into the Bruno-Scarfo crime
family, according to a 90-page police affidavit.
   During the ceremony, the trigger finger of each initiate was
pricked. Each man said ``may I burn in hell if I betray my friends
in the family'' as he crumpled a piece of burning paper with his
bare hands, the affidavit said.
   A gun and a knife symbolized that members ``live by the gun and
die by the gun, live by the knife and die by the knife,'' it said.

   The shortage of donor organs is so acute
that hospitals must begin approaching the families of dead patients
to save other lives, a transplant specialist said Tuesday.
   Hospital officials rarely ask grieving families to consider
donating their loved ones' organs, said Dr. Calvin Stiller, head of
transplant surgery at the University of Western Ontario.
   When they do, the question is often so awkwardly worded the
families immediately reject the idea, he said.
   ``Sometimes it can be: `you don't want to donate the organs, do
you?' '' said Stiller, who estimated that at least 80 percent of
possible donor organs go unused.
   A panel of medical experts discussed the problem here Tuesday
during the International Congress of Transplantation Society.
   Dr. Oscar Salvatierra, chief of University of California-San
Francisco's transplant service, said media attention helped find
donors in some cases.
   However, publicity doesn't always work, considering the
``limited donor pool,'' he told the gathering of about 2,700 people
representing 47 countries.
   Last year, 3,993 people in the United States were registered as
organ donors.
   By contrast, 13,290 transplants were performed, according to the
United Network for Organ Sharing, which contracts with the federal
government to run a national organ distribution network and
registry.
   There are about 20,460 patients waiting for organs, the UNOS
said.
   The public should be ``educated, encouraged and cajoled to
donate for love,'' said Dr. Anthony Monaco, professor of surgery at
Harvard University.
   The government could pay the donor, he said.
   ``Say, everyone could get a government insurance policy ... if
they will agree to donate,'' he said.
   But Stiller said many in the medical and scientific communities
opposed paying donors.
   Donating is ``no longer a charitable event. It's an
obligation,'' he

<DATELINE>GUZOW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland's noble families, dispersed around
the world or reduced to cramped walkups in their native land, have
little but memories of their once elegant estates.
   Most of the landed gentry's homes have been destroyed since the
Communists nationalized their property in the late 1940s.
   Now, with the Communist regime gone, a last-chance effort is
afoot to preserve the remaining historic manors, either by
returning them to their former owners or finding new ones.
   Ludwika Sobanska-Tyszkiewiczowa, born to one of Poland's noblest
families and married to another, remembers the vast estate of her
birth in the Ukraine. At age 2, she played with nuts on the floor
as the Bolshevik revolution of 1917 raged outside the sandbagged
windows.
   As a newlywed on the eve of World War II, she moved to her
husband's manor in eastern Poland. Within a year, she was swimming
the river outside with her baby strapped to her back and the Red
Army in pursuit.
   Equally vivid are recollections of the carefree opulence of
those years between the wars, when the lawns and ballroom of the
family palace at Guzow, outside Warsaw, was filled with Poland's
dignitaries.
   With a wistfulness echoed even by Poles of common birth, Mrs.
Sobanska lingers on the memory of her family's ``dwory,'' manor
houses of the self-sufficient estates on which rural Poland's
social and economic system was based for four centuries.
   Dwory were administrative centers for the surrounding farmland,
warehouses and mills. Some were palaces, others large farmhouses.
They were built in tune with the vacillating fortunes of Poland's
passionately nationalist, clannish and independent nobility, which
was 10 percent of the population in the 16th century and among
Europe's largest through the 18th century.
   Of Mrs. Sobanska's properties in Poland, Guzow and a Warsaw
mansion still stand, but they no longer belong to her. What did not
succumb to war or shifting borders was taken by the new Communist
state.
   Stately homes of Poland's much-romanticized gentry became the
orphanages and factory headquarters of People's Poland. Farmland
was divided among the peasants.
   Without money for proper upkeep, dwory fell to ruin and were
abandoned, with tragic consequences to the nation's cultural
heritage.
   Forty-five years later, little remains. Of the estimated 20,000
historic homes that survived World War II, only about 2,000 are
salvageable.
   Nostalgia, the desire to right wrongs and capitalist zeal for a
good bargain propel the preservation effort.
   Former owners may apply to reclaim their properties. The Culture
Ministry and the post-Communist era's first private real estate
companies also are hunting new buyers.
   ``What is happening in Poland now offers great hope for
monuments,'' said Tadeusz Zielinewicz, the ministry's chief
building conservator. ``We conservators have always been saying the
best way of protecting a monument is a good use, a good owner. The
state was not such a good owner.''
   In many ways, it is painful work.
   ``It has all turned into ruin,'' Mrs. Sobanska said after a
recent tour of the palace at Guzow, 25 miles east of Warsaw, now
headquarters for an adjacent sugar beet factory. ``It will be too
late for me, but maybe someone from my family can invest.''
   Pravin Shah, a jeans merchant from Wales, stood somberly before
the decaying facade and boarded-up windows of a manor in Zdunowo.
   ``It makes me sad to see something so beautiful standing there,
waiting,'' said Shah, who is looking over Polish manors in search
of an investment.
   Grass covered the sweeping drive and sewage choked the
ornamental ponds. Sunlight filtering through a hole in the roof
touched the few bits of ornamental plaster still in place.
   The manor was used as an agricultural school, then abandoned for
a decade, and a young Polish architect bought it for a song two
years ago.
   He wants to make it into a 55-room hotel and restaurant just 45
minutes north of the capital, but needs $2.5 million. Janusz
Lipinski, co-founder of Poland's first real estate agency, Korona,
is looking for a Western investor who sees the potential in a
country so short of tourist accommodations.
   Lipinski has 100 or more applications from families seeking to
buy back homes that were nationalized after the war. Parliament is
working out favorable terms, but most families don't have enough
money.
   This ``re-privatization'' of homes, as opposed to farmland, is
encouraged by many people who harbor a deep respect for the
stratified society of Poland's past glory. Despite four decades of
communism, the names of aristocratic Polish families are easily
recalled.
   In July, when Princess Klaudia Sanguszko visited the family
estate near Tarnow in southeastern Poland, former servants lined up
to meet her and the town council made her son, called ``the young
prince'' by newspapers, an honorary citizen.
   Purchases by foreigners are more controversial and few have come
to fruition. Members of Parliament, nervous about Poland's being
``bought out,'' especially by a united Germany next door, voted
last month to prohibit sales of state-owned property to foreigners.
   Long-term leases are allowed, and privately owned tracts of land
can be sold with Interior Ministry permission. Joint-venture
companies also can buy.
   Joanna Onyskiewicz, Lipinski's partner in the Korona agency, is
adamant about bringing commercial viability to Poland's historic
properties.
   ``We have no other chance, in a country where the kitty is
empty, to save our heritage ourselves,'' she said.
   Low prices are a large part of the lure. A manor in rundown
condition can sell for as little as $1,000.
   Korona offers a 10-room country house with surrounding gardens
that could be remodeled as a small hotel, for a modest total
investment of $250,000.
   There is the stuff of dreams: a gutted, 36-bedroom palace from
the early 18th century on 30 acres of parks that once were
landscaped. The Rubber Industry Institute will sell it for $200,000.
   Falling in love with a Polish dwor is just the beginning.
   ``Buyers face a fantastic amount of red tape,'' Lipinski said.
``You have to be patient in Poland.''
   Both initial questions _ Who is the owner and how much does it
cost? _ require detective work in the infamous bureaucratic maze.
   Some properties are government-owned with a state industry as a
long-term tenant.
   Buyers also face the daunting task of a complete renovation,
from water pipes to roof, in a nation short of building materials.
Strict rules for historical restoration must be followed.
   An ugly, polluting industry may have been built nearby, Lupinski
said, sighing over a paint factory beside a moated, 15th century
castle.
   ``It is a pleasure to work with these buildings but . . . so
depressing to see their situation,'' he said, then pointed at the
crumbling, lifeless Zdunowo mansion and added: ``That from 45 years
of communism.''

   Distraught people telephone the Gulf Support Group
for news of relatives stranded in Kuwait and Iraq, but they often
end up talking about themselves.
   ``When people call looking for information, we ask them `Are you
all right?' and other questions which will elicit how they are
coping,'' Joanna Copley, one of the hotline organizers, said Monday.
   Ms. Copley's 27-year-old sister, Katharine, was on board a
British Airways flight that stopped for fuel in Kuwait on Aug. 2,
the day Iraq invaded the emirate. As of Friday, she was still in
that occupied country.
   Many of the callers, like the widow whose only child is in
Kuwait, do not want advice. They're just looking for a soothing
voice and a friendly ear to hear them work through their grief,
anger, frustration and guilt.
   ``They feel guilty, first, because they are safe in England and
secondly, because if they've had a family quarrel they may wish
that they'd left on better terms and that there may never be a
chance to make things right,'' Ms. Copley said in an interview at
the hotline offices.
   The hotline was set up Aug. 7 as an information clearing house
for relatives of Britons stranded in Kuwait and Iraq. It receives
up to 200 calls each day, said Ms. Copley, 29, a computer
consultant.
   Her pearls and country-style dress with a large white ribbon
belie a steely determination. ``I don't know why I decided to act.
Maybe I react faster, or get angry quicker,'' she said.
   The Foreign Office estimates there are 4,000 British citizens in
Kuwait and 500 in Iraq, the largest number of Westerners in the
crisis area.
   Ms. Copley said relatives grow more anxious each day, their
fears fueled by reports and rumors swirling around the Persian Gulf.
   The only Westerner to have been killed in Kuwait since the Aug.
2 invasion is Douglas Croskery, a 45-year-old British businessman
shot near the Saudi Arabian border as he tried to leave Kuwait.
   On Monday, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said diplomats were
trying to verify the whereabouts of 123 Britons rounded up in
Kuwait.
   And he said the Foreign Office was working closely with the Gulf
Support Group, which includes a member of Parliament, Robert
Hayward, among its founders.
   ``Our officials in Kuwait and Baghdad are doing their utmost _
they are doing a formidable job _ they are doing their utmost to
keep in touch with people in difficulty, to find out what is
happening,'' Hurd said. ``It's extremely difficult to do so. I pay
tribute to Rob Hayward, I pay tribute to people in the same
business.''
   Calls have come from all over, Ms. Copley said.
   Britons escaping Kuwait have added to the information from
diplomatic sources, but many of the escapees require counseling
themselves, Ms. Copley said
   ``A guy I just got off the phone with admitted that he only had
10 pounds ($19). He worked in Kuwait, his house is in Kuwait and
his bank account is there. He has no way of getting money,'' she
said.
   ``These people aren't professionals, they are not wealthy
ex-pats (ex-patriots). Many are oil and gas workers with only the
clothes they stand up in.''
   Trained volunteers have said relatives and escapees are calling
``in a serious state of desperation.''
   ``Many can't talk about it without crying, both women and men. I
get emotional,'' Ms. Copley said, her voice faltering.
   The Foreign Office also set up a telephone line for relatives,
but it was heavily criticized for making it a pay-per-call number.
The Foreign Office subsequently announced that the proceeds would
go to charity.
   Ms. Copley said she would not criticize the Foreign Office, but
she added: ``Families are not interested in future charities. They
have immediate problems.''

   After a three-month delay to fix a
hydrogen leak, space shuttle Columbia will lift off on an astronomy
mission Sept. 1, NASA says.
   NASA on Monday set the launch date for the nine- to 10-day
mission. Liftoff is scheduled for 1:17 a.m. EDT.
   Columbia will carry seven astronauts, including four astronomers
who will operate the $150 million Astro observatory from the
shuttle's cargo bay in their study of ultraviolet light and X-rays
from stars, supernovas and other celestial bodies.
   The mission has been on hold since the fuel leak was found in
May. A similar problem with Atlantis prompted the space agency in
June to ground the shuttle fleet temporarily.
   Columbia's flight will be the first shuttle mission since April,
when Discovery carried the flawed Hubble Space Telescope into
orbit. It also will be the first shuttle flight in five years
devoted entirely to scientific research.

<TEXT>
   Scientists are turning an isolated
island into a laboratory to test a genetically engineered rabies
vaccine on raccoons.
   In the first field test of the vaccine in the United States, 26
scientists Monday took boats to Parramore Island and put out 4,000
doses of the vaccine inside baited tubes to attract the 400
raccoons on the strip of land.
   Over the next year, some of the animals will be caught alive and
tested to see if the vaccine produced antibodies to fight rabies.
   Raccoons are the biggest source of rabies in the United States,
often transmitting the virus to dogs and cats that tangle with them.
   ``If we can control rabies in the raccoon population, we will
have come a long way in handling rabies in pets,'' said Dr. Suzanne
Jenkins, assistant epidemiologist with the state Health Department.
   The only sign of man on the 10-mile-long barrier island is a
Coast Guard station at one end.
   ``We knew we needed an island for this test because we wanted
limited access and a population of raccoons that would not be
wandering off somewhere,'' Ms. Jenkins said. ``Since this is a
test, it was felt it would be better if there was not public
access. You don't let people into your laboratory. What we've done
is create an outdoor laboratory.''
   The vaccine, developed by Philadelphia's Wistar Institute, is
inserted into small tubes of soft plastic treated with fish oil.
   ``Then the bait is covered with a crab slurry _ crab parts that
have been left out for awhile _ to attract the raccoons,'' said
Warren B. Cheston, Wistar associate director. As a raccoon chews on
the bait, the liquid vaccine is released in its mouth.
   The Wistar is the nation's oldest non-profit biomedical research
institute.
   Using genetic engineering, Wistar took from the rabies virus a
minute piece of genetic material that induces formation of
antibodies, and grafted that fragment onto the harmless vaccinia
virus, used in smallpox vaccine.
   A similar vaccine is being used in Europe and Canada to control
rabies in foxes. Scientists believe the Wistar vaccine could have
broader application.
   Robert Miller of the U.S. Department of Agriculture said if the
test on Parramore Island works, the department will approve a
mainland test of the vaccine. Cheston said Wistar has been working
with Pennsylvania to find a test site.
   The vaccine, engineered in 1982, may be available within five
years.
   Ms. Jenkins said the bait could be spread from airplanes, as is
being done in Canada.
   ``I could see using it to produce corridors of vaccinated
animals around population centers to keep rabies out,'' she said.
``You could encircle isolated cases of rabies in the same manner
and keep it from spreading.''

<TEXT>
   An experimental drug made from a Japanese
fungus improves liver transplant patients' chances of survival by
up to 20 percent over those taking the standard anti-rejection
medication, scientists say.
   Transplant pioneer Dr. Thomas E. Starzl said Monday that 23
University of Pittsburgh studies of FK-506 confirm earlier findings
of its superiority over cyclosporine.
   Starzl, head of the university's transplant program, told
colleagues at a meeting of the International Congress of the
Transplantation Society this week in San Francisco that FK-506
poses a lower risk of kidney failure and high blood pressure, side
effects of cyclosporine.
   Both drugs prevent rejection of the transplanted organ
immediately after the operation, but FK-506 also prevents delayed
rejection, researchers said.
   ``The initial results are very encouraging,'' said Dr. John
Armitage, an assistant professor of surgery at the university who
conducted one of the studies. ``There's no question that FK-506 is
going to find its place in future treatment.''
   The university has given the drug to about 800 patients.
   The studies, conducted from February 1989 to June of this year,
included the first look at how the drug worked on children.
   Doctors said high doses of steroids were unnecessary for 42
young patients who used FK-506. Some patients need steroids to
reduce the toxicity of cyclosporine, but high doses can cause
stunted growth, facial puffiness and other problems.
   ``With FK-506, we're hoping that these children will not require
a second or third transplant,'' said Dr. Andreas Tzakis, an
associate professor of surgery who conducted the study. ``With the
scarcity of organs available for children, this drug may result in
organs available for a larger number of children.''
   But Dr. James Wolf, president of the United Network for Organ
Sharing, said FK-506 could make more people eligible for
transplants, creating pressure to find more donors. About 20,000
people are waiting for organ transplants in the United States.
   The drug, made by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. of Osaka,
Japan, has been approved for testing exclusively at the University
of Pittsburgh, although in a few cases it was given to patients at
other hospitals.
   The drug must undergo further studies before the Food and Drug
Administration approves its general use for liver transplant
patients. Further tests will be required before it can go on the
market for other transplant patients.
   ``There's no question it's a very effective drug for liver
transplants,'' said Dr. Robert Corry, board member of the United
Network for Organ Sharing. ``We still don't know enough about it
with other organs.''
   Dr. Ronald Lieberman, who directs an FDA team studying the drug,
said approval will probably take at least two years.
   In studies on liver transplant patients, the university reported:
   _Eighteen percent of those taking FK-506 developed high blood
pressure, compared with 60 percent of patients on cyclosporine.
   _Thirteen percent suffered kidney failure, compared with 26
percent for those on cyclosporine.
   _Potentially fatal infections occurred less frequently and were
less severe in patients taking FK-506.

<TEXT>
   Twenty-two Hawaiian Airlines employees have been
charged with stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of
property from baggage, cargo and mail, federal officials said
Monday.
   A 76-count federal grand jury indictment unsealed Monday accuses
the employees of stealing items including cash, jewelry, clothing,
televisions, stereo components, cameras and video equipment, U.S.
Attorney Dan Bent said.
   Those charged were responsible for loading and unloading baggage
on domestic and international flights, Bent said.
   ``Sometimes baggage would be purposely broken apart, dropped,
etc., so that the contents would be revealed and they could
identify that it was something worth stealing,'' said Jim R.
Freeman, special agent in charge of the FBI's Honolulu office.
   ``This would be either stolen by those individuals or they would
pass the word to confederates down the line,'' Freeman said.
   Five of the men were arrested Monday, 16 will appear voluntarily
for arreignment and one remained at large, officials said.
   The total value of items stolen was unknown, Bent said. However,
the value of items recovered to date is estimated at $50,000.
   Bent said the conspiracy was brought to the attention of
authorities by the Hawaiian Airlines management. The airline
cooperated fully with the investigation, Bent said.
   The maximum punishment for theft of an item worth more than $100
from baggage of cargo or possession of the stolen items is 10 years
in prison and a $250,000 fine. Theft from mail or possession of
items stolen from mail carries a maximum sentence of five years in
prison and a $250,000 fine.

   Saddam Hussein appears to be keeping a

agree that he's firmly in control in Baghdad.
   The last time he was seen by the outside world was Aug. 14, when
Iraqi's state-run television showed him greeting King Hussein of
Jordan, one of his closest allies, at Baghdad Airport.
   The Jordanian monarch was in Iraq for talks on the crisis
following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Saddam, 54, has made several important statements over the last
few days, but these have been read on Iraqi television and radio by
an announcer.
   The sources, who all spoke on condition of anonymity, dismissed
reports in the Arab media that there have been attempts to
assassinate Saddam and his senior aides in recent days.
   One well-informed source declared: ``He's very much alive. These
reports are groundless.'' The source said the Iraqi capital was
``calm, but naturally a little tense'' as Iraq builds up its forces
in Kuwait and the United States strengthens its military contingent
in Saudi Arabia.
   Official sources in Cairo reported Monday that the Foreign
Ministry received a report from Sayed Abu-Zaid, the Egyptian
ambassador in Baghdad, that made no mention of any attempts on
Saddam's life.
   There have been several reported assassination attempts against
Saddam since he took power in 1979.
   Baghdad Radio reported that Saddam met Monday with Indian
External Affairs Minister Indir Kumar to discuss ``bilateral
relations.'' The meeting was attended by Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz, it said.
   It also reported that the president sent a close confidant,
Saadoun Hammadi, to Moscow on Monday. Hammadi is a member of the
ruling 11-man Revolutionary Command Council headed by Saddam.
   A senior military source in an Arab capital said Monday that he
was in daily telephone contact with Saddam and that the Iraqi
leader was clearly in control in Baghdad.
   ``We know how President Saddam is doing because we're in touch
with him constantly by telephone,'' said the source, who spoke on
condition that his name and nationality were not disclosed. He told
The Associated Press: ``We talk to him all the time.''
   This source said Saddam is ``living with his in-laws in Baghdad.
He's not hiding out in a military base as everyone thinks.''
   He gave no other details. Nor did he explain why the president
should be living with his wife's family and not in his heavily
guarded palace on the banks of the Tigris River, or in his command
bunker.
   But if the report is correct, it could be that Saddam is
concerned about the possibility of a U.S. air or missile strike
against the palace or other buildings he is known to frequent.
   Egypt's Middle East News Agency last week quoted a Palestinian
official as saying he met Saddam at a military complex outside
Baghdad, where the Iraqi leader, ``haggard and pale,'' was
protected by heavy security following a reported assassination
attempt.
   During the 1980-88 war with Iran, Saddam was often not seen in
public for periods of up to two weeks. But the state-controlled
media bombarded Iraq's 16 million people with photographs and
television footage of their leader in uniform with his troops or
meeting commanders.

   By midday Monday, the temperature in the
Saudi desert was probably 130 degrees. But Lt. Col. Jim Mattis
wouldn't know _ his thermometer only reaches 120.
   The desert is a cruel place, as the Marine platoon in the hills
several miles from the nearest road is finding out. By 8:30 a.m.
Monday, the sun was so hot a group of Marines in a mortar unit
gladly remained hidden under their camouflaged tents.
   ``We just try to rest when we can and stay cool when we can,''
said one. In line with Defense Department rules, neither he nor any
of the enlisted men could give their names, and the location of
their unit could not be disclosed.
   The Marines' tents _ covered with camouflaged netting _ were so
well concealed that only their vague outline could be distinguished
in the brown sand.
   A group of Marines relaxed on tarps under one big tent, while
smaller numbers manned the mortars and served as lookouts.
   The Marines have trained in the Mojave Desert, but the United
States has not been involved in a desert campaign since the United
States and Great Britain joined together to defeat the Germans in
North Africa in 1943.
   Because of the heat, the men usually keep watch just two hours
at a time. In their off hours, they sleep, eat, bone up on desert
warfare tactics and perform chores such as cleaning their guns.
   All Marines are issued three packages of food _ MREs for Meal
Ready to Eat _ daily. Each package contains about 3,000 calories in
the form of crackers, a beef or chicken meal, cheese, cookies and
dehydrated fruit.
   Water is one of the biggest challenges in the desert; Marines
are told to drink five gallons a day, which is brought in by
``water buffalo,'' or military trailers used to haul water.
   To ward off the sun, they cover their skin, use sunscreen and
wear hats and sunglasses.
   Even so, they are only kept out in the desert for three days
before rotating back to the makeshift barracks, usually big
air-conditioned rooms.
   While the heat is overpowering, several Marines said their
biggest fear is the threat of chemical weapons.
   Each Marine has a gas mask, plus three vials of Atropen, an
antidote to nerve gas. Should a Marine be exposed to the gas, he
must inject himself with the agent.
   For the Marines, one of the biggest frustrations is being out of
touch with world events.
   Even. Maj. Gen. John Hopkins, head of the 7th Marine
Expeditionary Brigade, said he had no time to listen to the radio
to find out what the reaction in the United States was to the
deployment.

   Scores of Arabs have fled Kuwait into
Saudi Arabia by walking across the desert or slipping past Iraqi
soldiers by car, but now only a few Western refugees are making the
run.
   Three Britons who made it across the border on Sunday were the
last reported Western escapees along that route, border area
residents said Monday.
   One Saudi resident, speaking in a telephone interview, said
fewer Kuwaiti families were arriving but that dozens of Egyptians,
Pakistanis and Indian workers were walking part of an 80-mile
stretch to reach Saudi Arabia.
   ``The ones coming in just look very confused,'' said the
resident, who could see the refugees at the Saudi Arabian border
checkpoint at Khafji.
   ``The ones who go on foot seem to just move through the dense
Iraqi troop movements on the other side,'' he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``But the cars do not seem to be coming
across now as they used to do in earlier days.''
   Some travelers said Iraqi troops and tanks were apparently
cutting off open border areas which hundreds of Westerners and
Kuwaitis have fled across since Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
ordered his troops into Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Attempting a border crossing can be a deadly maneuver, refugees
said.
   ``They shoot at any approaching car,'' said a traveler who
arrived in Khafji late last week. ``The (soldiers) fired at a car
behind me and injured a 37-year-old woman in her right thigh.''
   Life inside Iraqi-occupied Kuwait is also growing more dangerous.
   Iraqi television, which is now broadcast in Kuwait, announced
last week that anyone hoarding food would be executed.
   One traveler told the Khafji residents that the Sultan Center, a
large grocery store in the Kuwait city suburb of Salmiya, was
completely out of provisions.
   But Kuwaitis say their families usually have large quantities of
food stored, usually sufficient for a month.
   Some Kuwaitis in Saudi Arabia said they contact relatives and
friends still in Kuwait by car telephones that work on the other
side of the border. Those inside Kuwait say they are not permitted
to buy anything in large quantities.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Iranians returning
from Kuwait as saying foodstuffs were scarce, the city bazaar was
closed and the general situation in Kuwait was tense.
   ``They say Iraqi soldiers are taking position here and there
throughout Kuwait and especially in al-Ahmadi port with tanks and
armored vehicles roaming in the city streets amid sporadic
overnight shooting,'' the agency reported.
   The agency estimated that 10,000 Iranians of the 100,000-strong
Iranian community in Kuwait have returned to Iran.
   Kuwaitis fleeing their country into Saudi Arabia often arrive
disheveled and dejected, their eyes bloodshot.
   They huddle around transistor radio listening to reports from
Free Kuwait Radio that are broadcast clandestinely somewhere in the
Persian Gulf.
   Their newspapers, among the liveliest in the Arab world despite
a censorship clamped since 1986, are beginning to emerge in other
capitals _ Al-Qabas in London, Al-Anbaa in Cairo and shortly
Al-Seyassah in Saudi Arabia. The others have yet to make a comeback.
   Kuwaiti embassies in gulf countries have been looking after the
refugees, arranging accommodations, financial assistance and
medical care.
   The younger men invariably say they have decided on one thing _
to see that their families are settled in safer countries, and then
they will join the resistance at home.
   ``We will fight, win or die,'' said Bandar al-Shallahi, a
journalist with the Kuwait News Agency. ``It's pointless to live
without a country. And we will reinstate our emir, Sheik Jaber
al-Ahmed al-Sabah, whether Saddam likes it or not.''

   At a long table in a windowless room in the
State Department, U.S. consular officers answer about 4,000
telephone calls a day from worried relatives of the Americans whom
President Bush described Monday as hostages in Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``It was heavier in the beginning and it seems to kind of go in
cycles, depending on events,'' said Judy Baroody, press officer for
the special task force set up by the department to deal with the
crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   Ms. Baroody said from 60 to 80 officers staff the telephone bank
24 hours a day, in shifts of 15 at one time.
   ``They have a system of data banks in which they keep names and
information about American citizens to provide to relatives,'' Ms.
Baroody said.
   At all times, one officer is detailed to handle special cases
such as those with particular medical needs or small children.
   She said this officer also deals with the families of those in
Iraqi custody, such as the 12 the department said were taken from
hotels in Kuwait's capital and moved to undisclosed locations.
   ``Information that might be given out would be what kind of
advice is being provided to Americans in Kuwait and Iraq, whether
the borders are closed and whether it is safe to cross by a land
route,'' the press officer said.
   She said they also provide information on food supplies
available, curfews and problems involving exit permits.
   Ms. Baroody described the room as a typical office with
fluorescent lighting in the ceiling, like others in the State
Department. It is an interior room with no windows.
   There are more than 3,000 Americans and thousands of other
foreign citizens now under Iraqi control.
   The administration had been reluctant to call them hostages,
saying no demands had been made as conditions for their release.
   Bush, addressing the national convention of the Veterans of
Foreign Wars in Baltimore, demanded the release of the foreigners
and said that ``whatever these innocent citizens are called, they
are in fact hostages.''
   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein said in Baghdad Sunday that he would
free the foreign nationals if Bush withdrew U.S. forces from Saudi
Arabia and if a worldwide trade embargo against Baghdad were lifted.

<TEXT>
   Residents of the Florida Keys are fed up
with Bausch and Lomb's monkey business.
   The vision-care giant put thousands of monkeys on two small,
deserted islands more than a decade ago to breed, offering a steady
supply of laboratory animals to biomedical researchers.
   But people who live near the islands where the rhesus monkeys
have been allowed to run free, fouling the water and turning lush
mangrove trees into useless skeletons, object to what they deem
needless environmental destruction.
   ``It looks like a war zone right now. Just like Vietnam,'' said
James McElroy, who's part of a grass-roots anti-monkey campaign.
   The rhesus monkeys have been good business since they were first
brought over from India 18 years ago. Handlers regularly dispense
monkey chow and capture more than a thousand each year, generating
more than $1.5 million in annual sales.
   The breeding colonies became more important to U.S. researchers
after India, Pakistan and Bangladesh banned monkey exports in the
late 1970s, said Dr. Joseph Held, vice president for primate
research at Charles River Laboratories, the division of Bausch and
Lomb that runs the islands.
   And because they are untainted by Herpes B virus and other
infections from the outside world, they are much more valuable than
other primates destined for the nation's laboratories, Held said.
   ``It's the cleanest, healthiest commercial production colony in
the world,'' Held said.
   Most of the animals are sold to labs doing advanced neurological
research; none are used for eye-care tests, the company says.
   More than 1,900 breeding animals and several thousand of their
offspring roam on 300 acres of partially submerged wetlands on Key
Lois and Raccoon Key, another company-owned island several miles
away.
   Even Charles River Laboratories, which is under a consent
agreement to replace damaged trees and reduce the population,
agrees that the monkeys have made a mess of things.
   The rhesus stripped the leaves from thousands of red mangroves,
a protected species, and now struggle to find shade in the Florida
sun. Their waste has fouled the waters, leaving a band of
yellowish-brown algae that chokes out marine life.
   ``They weren't too noticeable until the vegetation began
disappearing. That's when people became alarmed,'' McElroy said.
   Even armed with the necessary permits from pro-growth Keys
officials, humans could never get away with such destruction, said
Curt Kruer, a biologist and Audobon Society leader who has studied
Keys wetlands for 13 years and can see Key Lois from his backyard.
   ``You could take all the mangroves destroyed for condo projects
in the Keys in the past 10 years and it wouldn't come close to
this,'' Kruer said as he poled his boat in for a close look at Key
Lois last week. ``Where's it all going to end?''
   The state owns everything below the high-water line, including
the area where most of the mangroves have been destroyed, and
environmental officials ordered the company to clean up those
grounds years ago.
   Charles River Laboratories fenced in and replanted some trees,
but disputed the boundary and sued the state in 1986. Nothing much
changed until the two sides quietly agreed to a settlement in May
that would allow the company to phase out the monkeys over 20-30
years.
   McElroy, Kruer and other Keys activists raised a ruckus. Gov.
Bob Martinez and the Florida Cabinet, eager to improve their
environmental image in this election year, responded by scuttling
the agreement and deciding to go after Charles River for destroying
state property instead.
   ``They just stripped all the state land and left it bare,''
Martinez said at the June 26 cabinet meeting. ``I'd like to see if
we can prosecute.''
   Ken Plante, general counsel for the Florida Department of
Environmental Resources, says the title dispute must be resolved
first. A status hearing has been scheduled for Aug. 30.
   The department is still trying to find surveyors willing to
brave the monkeys and measure the property, Plante said.
   Meanwhile, the company is quietly scouting out alternative sites
where the breeding operation can be moved, said Barbara Kelley, a
spokeswoman at Bausch and Lomb's Rochester, N.Y., headquarters.

<HEAD>Environmentalists, Consumer Groups Hail Texas Open Records Rules</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texans soon will be able to see previously secret
documents stemming from legal battles, including those fought over
sensitive environmental and product-liability cases.
   Civil liberties advocates, good-government groups and media
organizations are hailing the state Supreme Court's
first-in-the-nation procedural change, which takes effect Sept. 1.
   ``It's not that we expect, on the first day, a line of people
walking into the courthouse,'' said Jim Harrington, Texas Civil
Liberties Union legal director. ``But the rules will turn the files
there into a public library for our watchdogs.''
   Environmentalists and consumer organizations were particularly
thrilled by the change, adopted in April at the request of the
Legislature. They frequently have won settlements only to have
sealed court records keep information on toxic substances and other
hazards unavailable.
   ``If a manufacturer loses a lawsuit, such as exploding gas tanks
on an automobile, that information can't be sealed up and filed
away in a file drawer someplace,'' said Tom Smith, director of
Public Citizen, a consumer rights group in Austin.
   Maintaining open records ``can do nothing but help protect the
public,'' said Mary Kelly, an Austin lawyer and legal coordinator
for the Sierra Club in Texas.
   But Dane Harris, president of the Texas Association of Business,
said the rule could hurt businesses that may become targets of
lawsuit-minded attorneys on ``fishing expeditions.''
   ``We feel like it opens up the opportunity for people to become
aware of sometimes competitive, trade-sensitive information. We
think it invites needless litigation,'' said Harris, whose
organization urged the justices not to adopt the rule.
   ``We feel like just having these records available for whoever
wants to go on a fishing expedition is not conducive to a
pro-business climate that will maintain and create jobs.''
   Some defense lawyers also have claimed the threat of publicizing
court documents would hurt their chances of obtaining settlements.
   The rules, adopted by a 5-4 vote, say no court order or opinion
may be sealed. Other records are presumed open and can be sealed
only by showing a ``serious or substantial interest.''
   The new rules open ``discovery'' documents _ those exchanged by
opposing lawyers before trial _ if they contain information that
could affect public safety or governmental operations.
   ``It is extremely important in that some of the best information
on hazardous chemicals has been developed through litigation,''
said Ms. Kelly. ``In litigation, everyone is motivated to find out
as much as they can through discovery. A lot of information on the
hazards of asbestos was blown open through litigation.''
   The rules do not cover divorce records and other family matters,
some monetary amounts in settlements and pretrial matters involving
trade secrets.
   Madelyn Applebaum, spokeswoman for the Association of Trial
Lawyers of America, said Texas was the first to adopt the rules,
although Florida has since adopted such a policy and efforts are
under way in New York to release records.
   She said two weeks ago the Rhode Island governor vetoed a bill
that would have adopted similar rules.

   A old safe found in a creek was cracked open
before a crowd of onlookers, revealing no gold, jewels or cash _
just mud and rust.
   A locksmith and his son pried open the door of the two-ton,
6-foot safe Monday, prompting a cheer from the crowd.
   Inside the rusty iron box were empty shelves coated with silt
and mud from Mill Creek, where it was thought to have been dumped
after the old state Capitol burned in 1935.
   ``Have you seen Geraldo?'' state Treasurer Tony Meeker joked,
referring to Geraldo Rivera's much-ballyhooed TV program on the
opening of Al Capone's vault in Chicago. Like Salem's safe,
Capone's vault was virtually empty.
   Since no one knew for sure that Salem's safe was only
heavyweight litter, the opening was awaited with hope of finding
valuables or historical artifacts.
   James Jones, coordinator of the state Historical Properties
Commission, said it wasn't a total loss _ the safe has historical
value and could become a museum piece.``I'm just glad it's in such
good shape inside,'' he said.
   Jones and about 100 volunteers had removed the safe from the
creek last week and set it up on the sidewalk in front of his
office.

   One man who acts as
America's electronic eyes and ears over a good part of Saudi Arabia
says the skies are filled with a constant stream of U.S. aircraft
from Operation Desert Shield.
   ``There's just a whole ton of people up there,'' said Lt. Mark
Smith, a Navy radar officer aboard the surveillance aircraft E-2C
Hawkeye.
   A bit clumsy in appearance but more high-tech in performance,
Smith's twin-engine turboprop is adorned with a flat radar disk
similar to the much larger AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control
System) planes that also have been deployed to Saudi Arabia's
defense against a possible Iraqi invasion.
   Smith and his colleagues fly high above northwestern Saudi
Arabia to search out any possible threat from the air or the ground
to the battle group of the carrier U.S.S. Eisenhower, sailing far
below in the Red Sea.
   Because the crew _ with what its men call their ``electronic
goodies'' _ can peer far into the skies, they provide the battle
group with a large envelope of security. They can warn the ships of
any missiles, aircraft or vessels that might appear beyond the
horizon undetected by the ships' own radar systems.
   And today in the skies above Saudi Arabia, tension and activity
are high. U.S. aircraft are appearing ``about every 30 miles or so
in a constant stream _ either inbound or outbound,'' Smith said.
   The crew might have 30 to 40 such friendly targets to follow at
a time.
   Some of them most probably are the C-130 transport aircraft
recently allowed to operate out of the United Arab Emirates. The
federation of sheikdoms on the southern edge of the Persian Gulf
has now joined Saudi Arabia in openly granting access to U.S.
forces to its strategic territory.
   Squadrons of F-16s, F-4s and F-15E jet fighters, A-10 bombers
and the F-117A stealth fighter-bombers are packing the skies.
   The Pentagon has pressed so many transport aircraft into service
for the Saudi operation that they've even turned to the Civilian
Reserve Air Fleet for the use of some U.S. commercial aircraft.
   ``As far as I can tell, the Iraqis are staying on their side,
and we're a long way away from them. That suits me just fine,''
Smith said. Because of the heightened state of activity, Smith said
the carrier's two Hawkeyes must be in the skies 24 hours a day.
   ``We're flying around the clock and we don't stop any more,''
said Smith during a 5:30 a.m. breakfast break on the carrier.
   The Eisenhower and its air wing had been scheduled to return
stateside next month until the Persian Gulf crisis diverted them to
the Red Sea.
   ``We're racking up a lot of flight hours now that we normally
wouldn't at the end of a deployment,'' Smith said, adding that each
crew takes to the skies twice a day, sometimes six to eight hours
at a time.
   The flying isn't the high profile fly-boy job held by the
carrier's jet fighter and bomber pilots, but the role is just as
vital.
   And despite their grueling schedule, the crews must fly with a
high degree of alertness.
   Should an enemy aircraft appear, their warning from the Hawkeye
might be the first to alert fellow seamen manning the battle
group's air defense weapons.
   ``If we make an error, a lot of people pay a big price, if we
don't find somebody or something that's on the way in,'' Smith said.

   World wheat production in 1990 is at record
levels and expected to exceed consumption, leading to the lowest
U.S. prices in two years, according to the Agriculture Department.
   The report, released Monday, says U.S. wheat supplies are
forecast up 18 percent from last year to 3.3 billion bushels, with
consumption up only 8 percent _ enough to use 2.4 billion bushels.
   This will lead to farm prices of about $1 per bushel less than
last year's $3.72, USDA says.
   ``Record 1990 wheat crops are forecast in Kansas and North
Dakota, the two largest producing states, pushing U.S. production
over 2.7 billion bushels for only the third time,'' said the USDA.
   ``Despite the large U.S. crop and lower prices, slack world
imports and increased competitor supplies will lead to lower U.S.
exports this year,'' said the department.
   However, those losses are expected to be more than offset by
greater feed use domestically.
   The general trade embargo against Iraq, sponsored by the United
Nations, is expected to cut about 3 percent from U.S. wheat and
flour exports, according to the department.
   That country, opposed by the United States for its invasion of
Kuwait, has been the eighth largest importer of U.S. wheat. It has
been the seventh largest importer of wheat from overall world
sources.

   Health conscious French are beginning to turn
from wine to fruit juice, with Made in the U.S.A. on many of the
labels.
   ``U.S. juice sales to France during 1985-88 jumped nearly 40
percent to $10.7 million,'' said Edwin Porter, the U.S.
agricultural attache in Paris.
   Porter co-wrote an article on the subject for the Agriculture
Department's AgExporter Magazine with Martine Brunet, a marketing
specialist.
   They said an increasing demand for healthy food and a decline in
alcoholic beverage consumption are driving the fruit juice market
in France.
   Orange juice is the favorite, with the French preferring their
juice in glass containers rather than paper ones.
   American grapefruit juice also is popular, said Porter and
Martine.
   The French import nearly all of their fruit juices.
   ``In 1988, the United States shipped to France 10,798 tons of
fruit juices and concentrates, worth $11.2 million, of which orange
juice and orange concentrate accounted for $7.95 million,'' Porter
and Martine said.

   A U.S. agricultural trade and development
mission will be visiting Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia
next month to expand sales of American products.
   ``These countries imported more than $200 million in U.S.
agricultural commodities last year,'' said Richard Crowder,
agriculture undersecretary. ``In addition, these markets represent
good opportunities for increased U.S. exports, particularly for
bulk commodities such as grains and soybean meal.''
   The trade mission is tentatively scheduled for Sept. 15-29. It
will include officials from the departments of agriculture and
state and the U.S. Agency for International Development.

<HEAD>VOA Beams Worlds of Cautions to Americans in Kuwait</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. citizens who want to escape from Kuwait
by crossing the desert receive daily words of caution by radio from
the State Department.
   The messages, beamed by the Voice of America and also carried by
the British Broadcasting Corp., change daily but in general advise
Americans to know the hazards of setting out across the desert.
   The VOA carries the messages hourly during the morning and
evening hours in which the Voice of America is beamed into the Arab
world.
   The message being carried late Monday said:
   ``The U.S. State Department advises American citizens that the
situation at this time in Baghdad and Kuwait is unclear. Iraqi
officials have reinforced their statement that Americans will be
gathered and moved. Our embassies are in contact with American
communities . . . and advising them to stay in their homes. We have
had reports of individuals who have been able to cross the border
without incident, but there can be no guarantee for the safety of
those attempting to cross. We are aware that American citizens may
be considering departure from Kuwait via the desert. We advise
Americans who are considering this route that there is a confirmed
report that at least one person has died attempting to cross the
desert. There are also unconfirmed, repeat unconfirmed, rumors that
others may have died attempting this route. We believe American
citizens should be aware of this information before attempting any
overland travel out of Kuwait.''.
   The report referred to as confirmed involved a British national.
   About 500 Americans already have been able to sneak into Saudi
Arabia, penetrating lax Iraqi security, but a caravan of others who
tried to flee were forced to beat a sweltering retreat.
   The clandestine departures reduced the number of civilian
Americans in Kuwait to 2,500, according to State Department
figures. Also stranded are 500 to 600 Americans in Iraq.

<HEAD>Ambassador Says Poland Needs Debt Relief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland's move to democracy and a market
economy is threatened by its foreign debt of nearly $41 billion, at
least part of which should be forgiven, says the country's new
ambassador to Washington.
   ``If there would be danger of the Polish reform breaking down
because of debt, that would have consequences in Europe and maybe
beyond,'' Ambassador Kazimierz Dziewanowski told a U.S. Chamber of
Commerce gathering Monday.
   The Bush administration has opposed debt forgiveness in
principle but there is some sentiment for it in Congress. About $3
billion of the debt is owed U.S. creditors.
   The new government feels justified asking some debt forgiveness
because the money ``was taken by the former regime, and we do not
know exactly what was done with it,'' said Dziewanowski, who was a
writer and journalist during the communist era.
   The Gulf crisis has complicated matters, he said, but Poland is
both optimistic and patient about prospects for obtaining ``at
least some rescheduling of our debt payments.''
   He said it was an odd twist that Iraq, the target of a worldwide
trade embargo ``during this difficult period of our economic
reform... is one of those few countries which owes us money,''
about $500 million.
   While taking issue with a report that the Iraqi debt to Poland
was $3 billion, the ambassador did not dispute that part
represented arms shipments.
   Poland stands to lose another half billion dollars as a result
of cuts in supplies of once-subsidized Soviet oil, he said.
   Dziewanowski, in Washington less than a month, told the Chamber
that Poland is framing new lenient regulations for foreign
investment under which ``we will try to meet (foreign investors) at
least half way, or maybe the greatest part of the way.''
   He said the new rules will provide for unlimited transfer of
profits abroad, end pre-screening of investments in all but the
most strategic industries, allow up to 100 percent foreign
ownership, use of Western accounting methods, and simplify income
tax at a 20 percent rate, half the former level.
   The $50,000 minimum investment requirement will be dropped,
opening the doors to small Polish-American businesses, the
ambassador added.
   An American Chamber of Commerce will be opened in Poland by
November, it was announced.

<HEAD>Families Get Confirmation of Worst Fears: Relatives Are Mideast
Hostages</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Americans held by Iraq aren't the only hostages.
   Mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and husbands and wives
seeking word from those trapped overseas are captives in a waiting
game that began when Iraq invaded Kuwait early this month.
   President Bush's decision Monday to label the estimated 3,000
Americans in Iraq and Kuwait hostages confirmed waiting families'
worst fears.
   ``I've felt all the time that they were hostages,'' said
Marjorie Walterscheid of Jacksboro, Texas. Her husband, Rainard,
52, is among 35 Americans moved from a Baghdad hotel to an
undisclosed location.
   Iraq announced that some Westerners have been placed near
military targets as shields against U.S. attack, heightening fears
among relatives.
   ``What happens if there's a shooting war?'' asked the Rev. Edwin
Davis of Koran, La. ``I'd like to be over there with them ... hold
my daughter's hand.''
   The 68-year-old minister said he's haunted by visions of the
ordeal facing his daughter, Kuwaiti son-in-law and their two
teen-age children.
   When he tries to sleep, he imagines the Middle East heat and
hears the helicopters that buzzed in the background the last time
his daughter called home, the night Iraqi tanks swarmed into Kuwait.
   Since the invasion, little news has reached relatives in the
United States. State Department officials have contacted some
families. Others simply wait.
   ``It scares me to death ... that (the Iraqis) would try and use
them as bargaining chips,'' said Kitty Dooley of Hopkinsville, Ky.
She last heard from her 40-year-old son hours after Iraqi troops
arrived in Kuwait City, where he managed several fast-food
restaurants.
   Jean Pryor is one of the lucky ones. After a roundabout trip, a
message from her daughter in Kuwait made it home to Pelham, Ala.,
last week. It said: ``I'm fine. I don't think I'm in danger. They
have moved me from the city to another province.''
   Pryor, who isn't sure who ``they'' are, said the brief
reassurance answered her prayers, but it is now more than a week
old. Persian Gulf tensions have escalated.
   ``I get up very early in the mornings so that by the time the
news goes off at night, my body goes to sleep,'' said Pryor, whose
daughter moved to Kuwait three years ago. ``But my heart is still
awake. It never sleeps.''
   Iraq's official news agency said Monday that Westerners would be
used to shield military targets against American attack. The
government also has warned that those who hide foreigners will face
the ``severest punishment.''
   Later, Iraq said the Westerners would be freed only if the
United States withdrew all troops and lifted an international trade
embargo.
   ``We have been reluctant to use the term hostage,'' Bush told
the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Baltimore. ``But when Saddam
Hussein specifically offers to trade the freedom of those citizens
of many nations he holds against their will in return for
concessions, there can be little doubt that ... they are in fact
hostages.''
   Laureen Utz Aljazireh, an American visiting relatives in
Minnesota when Iraq invaded Kuwait, awaits news of her Palestinian
husband who worked in Kuwait. ``The way things are going, I don't
think the outcome is going to be very good,'' she said.
   ``We live by the TV now,'' said Lynda Parker of Vidor, Texas.
``I live with a telephone in one hand and the remote control in the
other.'' Her husband, Bobby, 49, is a Kuwait Petroleum Co. worker
missing since the invasion.

<TEXT>
   The tactic of putting civilians in harms' way to
deter attack has been used in 20th-century combat by Germany,
Britain and the Viet Cong, but scholars say Saddam Hussein is the
first leader to announce it as a tactic.
   The Iraqi president said he would prevent more than 11,000
Westerners from leaving Iraq and Kuwait until the United States
withdraws from the Persian Gulf and lifts the blockade against his
country.
   They will be deployed at strategic military and industrial
points in Iraq to deter assault, Baghdad Radio said. Over the
weekend Saddam said, ``the presence of the foreigners with Iraqi
families at vital targets might prevent an attack.''
   U.S., British and other forces have been massing in the gulf
since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2 and annexed it.
   Adam Roberts, professor of international relations at Oxford
University, said Hussein's public announcement was not only highly
irregular, it was illegal in terms of the 1949 Geneva Convention IV
on international rules in time of war. Iraq signed the convention.
   Although the international force in Saudi Arabia is not at war
with Iraq, the Westerners were detained as a result of Iraq's
invasion.
   Clause 28 of the convention reads: ``The presence of protected
persons may not be used to render certain points or areas immune
from military operations.'' Protected persons in this context,
Roberts said, means civilians, both local and foreign.
   But he said there were several instances of countries using
foreigners and civilians in this way. The most recent was during
the Vietnam War.
   Early in the war, he said, the communist Viet Cong insurgents in
South Vietnam forced local civilians to march ahead of its troops
to try to prevent enemy troops from opening fire.
   During World War II the Germans placed Allied prisoners of war
on rooftops in occupied Holland to deter Allied bombers.
   Another case of human shields was disclosed by old official
documents declassified last year. This was Britain's ``minesweeping
taxi,'' used during the Arab rebellion in 1939 during the British
mandate over Palestine.
   The documents showed that taxis owned by known Arab
troublemakers were commandeered with their drivers and put at the
head of British convoys in case the road was mined.
   Lord Dufferin of Ava, who was then parliamentary undersecretary
at the Colonial Office, commented at the time: ``British lives are
being lost and I don't think we ... can protest squeamishly about
measures taken by the men in the front line.''
   B. J. Bond, a professor of war studies at London University,
said he knew of no official ``human shield'' threat by a national
leader in modern times.
   Donald Watt, professor of international history at the London
School of Economics, said he believed there were cases during World
War II where the Germans used civilians to drive over mine fields.
   ``But as for using hostages as a kind of shield as an instrument
of state policy, you would have to go back an awfully long way,''
he said.
   Watt said there had been a medieval custom whereby a person
signing a treaty gave the other party a close relative as a
hostage, ``a guarantee of your word.''
   David Capitanchik, senior lecturer in politics at Aberdeen
University, Scotland said the human shield idea ``is standard
practice for terrorist groups who take hostages. They always place
the hostages near the bombs.
   ``But is it not easy to think of a case in this century of a
government using human sandbags in this way. It is not easy to
recall a case where this is implemented as an act of state policy.''

<HEAD>Tourists Flock Back to Yosemite After Fires</HEAD>

<DATELINE>YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John and Linda Disosway
say whenever they plan to visit a national park on their vacation,
it catches fire.
   The Atlanta couple and their three children were among the
thousands who flocked to Yosemite Valley on Monday when roads
reopened after two lightning-caused fires forced an 11-day closure
and scorched more than 36 square miles.
   The 1,130-square-mile park in California's Sierra Nevada had
closed Aug. 9 for the first time in its 100-year history.
   The fires were among 1,300 lightning-caused blazes this month
that have burned more than 420 square miles throughout the state,
which in its fourth year of drought.
   ``We were in Yellowstone right after it burned,'' Mrs. Disosway
said Mpnday, referring to major fires in that park two years ago.
``Our timing's off.''
   They had worried that the park wouldn't reopen in time for their
one-day visit to see such landmarks as El Capitan, a 7,564-foot
sheer rock face and Half Dome, a rounded granite peak that broke in
half. Yosemite Falls, the tallest in North America with a drop of
2,425 feet, is another attraction.
   Vehicles stretched for 1{ miles as people waited for rangers to
open the entrance to the valley floor. Most campsites there and all
rooms in Yosemite Lodge were filled in advance.
   The fires contained over the weekend left hills and bushes
blackened, but they did not penetrate Yosemite Valley, thanks to
thousands of firefighters. Park officials prepared colored maps to
indicate where the fires burned.
   Newlyweds Tim and Erika Dallacqua of Ventura County were
honeymooning in Yosemite. They had switched their wedding to a
campground higher up after learning that the valley floor was
closed.
   ``We were married right on the riverbed,'' said Erika. ``It was
gorgeous.''
   Linda Nadel of Ridgway, Colo., said she would have found another
vacation site had Yosemite remained closed.
   ``But I wanted to come, so I'm glad it's open,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   An extreme right-wing member of Parliament has
proposed that Palestinians be used as ``human shields'' against an
Iraqi attack, much as Iraq's Saddam Hussein plans to use Westerners
to deter a U.S. assault.
   ``We should take them (Palestinians) and put them in front of
the invading Arab forces,'' lawmaker Rahaman Zeevi told
Parliament's foreign affairs and defense committee on Monday.
   Iraq repeatedly has threatened to attack Israel if the Jewish
state moves against it. Saddam has warned that he will use chemical
weapons to destroy half of Israel.
   Zeevi denied in an interview on Israel's army radio that his
proposal was comparable to the Iraqi president's threat to move
Westerners to Iraqi military and industrial sites as shields
against an American air attack.
   ``We cannot be compared with Saddam Hussein,'' said Zeevi, who
founded the extreme right-wing Moledet Party and was assistant army
chief of staff during the 1973 Middle East war.
   ``He grabs peace-minded citizens and turns them into a military
operation,'' Zeevi said. ``I am talking about a hostile population
that has proved their hostility to us with everything they can for
the past 33 months.''
   It was a reference to the Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, launched in December
1987.
   An estimated 1.7 million Palestinians live in the occupied
territories.
   Zeevi's Moledet, or ``homeland,'' Party advocates the transfer
of all Palestinians from Israeli-occupied lands. It has two seats
in Israel's 120-member Parliament and is not a member of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud coalition.

   Will a luxurious condominium project
lose anything in translation when builders try to duplicate its
design near a lake outside Moscow?
   Victor Malnev thinks not _ even though wood will be replaced by
concrete and steel.
   ``Maybe it will even look nicer than here,'' he said as he
toured the Four Beaches condominium development on Long Island
Sound.
   Malnev is chairman of the Soviet farm collective Zavet Ilyicha,
which jointly developing the suburban Moscow project with Senie
Kerschner International Housing Ltd. of Westport.
   The 1,000-member collective will not only lease the land for the
project but also provide produce for those living in the complex,
the first of its kind in the Soviet Union, Malnev said.
   Groundbreaking for the $130 million townhouse community,
designed to house foreign businessmen, is scheduled for the end of
September. The first of 528 units, to be built a Finnish company,
are expected to be ready by next July.
   The international residential community, to be named Rosinka, is
modeled on Four Beaches, a 135-unit condominium community
consisting of three-story, wood-frame buildings and a network of
wooden promenades and decks.
   Rosinka's three-story buildings will also have New England-style
architecture, but without wood because the building code does not
permit flammable materials, said Dick Williams, project manager for
Kerschner.
   Instead, Rosinka will be constructed of concrete with a steel
molding designed to look like the cedar clapboard on the condos at
Four Beaches, Williams said. The stairwell towers will be built of
glass and concrete rather than pressure-treated wood.
   Since the project was announced in April, at least 18 companies
from the United States, Western Europe and Japan have reserved
units, said Christopher Senie, secretary of the Senie Kerschner
International.
   Apartment sizes at Rosinka will range from 1,248 square feet to
2,712 square feet for a two-story townhouse. Annual rents will
range from $45,000 to $82,000.

   Yemen on Tuesday agreed it would turn away
an Iraqi oil tanker expected to arrive within hours. The agreement
followed an emergency Security Council meeting called on the matter.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering said the United States
requested the emergency council meeting after it received
information of the imminent arrival in Yemen of the tanker, which
defied a U.S. warship that fired across its bow Saturday.
   ``In the course of the evening, the Yemeni permanent
representative, told the council that Yemen would adhere to the
sanctions'' on Iraqi goods imposed after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait, Pickering said.
   Yemen, the 15-member council's only Arab member, had abstained
from the sanctions vote but had joined with the council in
declaring the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait ``null and void.'' Yemen
had also abstained from an Arab League vote on sanctions.
   Diplomats said the tanker would arrive in Yemeni territorial
waters within hours.
   Pickering said the council also accepted a U.S. draft resolution
that asked the United Nations to define what force it would take to
back up its embargo.
   The British ambassador, Sir Crispin Tickell, also said the
Yemeni representative agreed to turn away the tanker.
   The council agreed to convene at an ``early'' date to consider
the resolution. Pickering said the adjournment was to allow each of
the 15 Security Council members to consult with their governments
before the final vote.
   A formal meeting was possible today or Wednesday to adopt a
resolution calling for international military action against Iraq,
diplomats said.
   The draft proposal that called for members to take ``all
necessary action'' to enforce the U.N. embargo against Iraq. It
would authorize the deployment of maritime forces and the use of
``minimum force as may be necessary to verify the cargoes and
destinations of all ... shipping and to ensure the strict
enforcement'' of the embargo.
   The Cuban delegation also presented a separate proposal calling
for the exclusion of foodstuffs, medicine and medical assistance
from the U.N. embargo.
   The United States has been criticized by some countries for
policing the U.N. embargo without council approval.
   France and the Soviet Union are believed to be supportive, while
China is said to be wary but unlikely to block an enforcement
resolution with a veto.
   There is no exact precedent for the loose international military
action currently contemplated. Diplomats close to the negotiations
described the talks as complicated and requiring legal research.
   The diplomats emphasized that the United States and Britain were
not seeking to invoke Article 42 of the U.N. Charter, providing for
a U.N.-sponsored blockade to enforce sanctions.
   That article has never been invoked. The last U.N. enforcement
action was launched in Korea in 1950. That operation, however, was
placed under a U.S. command and was not organized under Article 42.
   Neither the United States nor Britain, they said, wanted a U.N.
commander to organize their national military actions. Even a U.N.
flag could imply some unacceptable U.N. supervision, they said.
   The only precedent for U.N. enforcement of sanctions came in
1966 when the Security Council called upon Britain to prevent, by
force if necessary, oil shipments to white-ruled Rhodesia, which
later was the object of a broad embargo.
   On Aug. 6, the Security Council adopted sweeping economic
sanctions against Iraq to punish the Baghdad government for
invading and occupying Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The Security Council last met Saturday night to condemn Iraq's
holding foreigners against their will. It demanded their immediate
release.
   Under Chapter 7, Article 42 of the U.N. Charter, the Security
Council is empowered to take military action to enforce its
sanctions. The charter provies that the council ``may take such
action by air, sea or land forces as may be necessary to maintain
or restore international peace and security.''
   Such action, it says, may include a blockade.

   Outspent, out-advertised and trailing in
the polls, Ann Richards says her bid for governor is doing just
fine.
   ``I've really felt up in about the last two weeks,'' the
Democratic nominee said. ``We're running on target, except we've
raised more money than I thought we would.''
   During those last two weeks, her Republican opponent,
oilman-rancher Clayton Williams, has been thrown on the defensive
by news reports questioning his business acumen. And Richards has
pounced on the issue.
   A hard-hitting TV commercial that began airing Friday portrays
multimillionaire Williams as a troubled businessman who misused
employees, is mired in debt and lawsuits and wants to keep it all
secret.
   ``Let's look behind the screen on Claytie TV,'' the ad says.
   The commercial was Richards' first post-primary television ad
and came after weeks of battering from Williams' TV commercials.
   Williams' aides called the 30-second spot mudslinging and a sign
of desperation.
   ``The farther she falls behind in the polls, the more bizarre a
sideshow her campaign is becoming,'' said Gordon Hensley, Williams'
press secretary. ``Mr. Williams is a man of honesty and integrity
and the polls are showing that the voters of Texas believe this to
be the case.''
   Williams on Friday countered with his new 30-second spot, which
accuses Richards of wrongdoing in the savings and loan debacle.
   The commercial suggests Richards, as state treasurer, assisted
S&amp;L executives in getting state deposits, accepted their political
contributions and then destroyed records showing where state money
was deposited.
   Richards said the ad is ``totally false ... and Clayton Williams
and his campaign staff know it.''
   Richards, who gained wide recognition with her caustic keynote
address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, survived a
brutal primary and runoff but has trailed in the few polls made
public since. The most recent, a survey of 821 Texans taken Aug.
5-8 for several TV stations, showed Williams ahead 49 percent to 38
percent. No margin of error was given.
   The Democrat said she isn't bothered by such numbers. She said
that the numbers are holding, even though Williams has been on
television almost continuously since June.
   But the polls also show a small number of undecided voters,
around 13 percent. And some Texas Democrats have said privately
they are worried.
   With Williams and the well-funded Sen. Phil Gramm atop the
Republican ticket, those Democrats are wondering just which of
their candidates down the ballot could be the ``stopper'' to a GOP
sweep.
   Williams has raised some $13 million and spent $11.3 million,
more than $6 million of that his own money, according to July 1
campaign finance reports. Richards reported raising and spending
just under $6 million.
   Karl Rove, a Republican consultant, said Richards has failed to
offer any message beyond her ``New Texas'' slogan. ``She's
determined to run a vacuous campaign,'' he said. ``She's not going
to talk about substance or issues.''
   Richards aides dispute that. Campaign consultant Glenn Smith
said Richards is exposing the real story behind Williams' TV image.
   Early in the race, Williams drew the wrath of women's groups
when he likened bad weather to rape. ``If it's inevitable, just
relax and enjoy it,'' Williams said. Later, he admitted visiting
prostitutes as a young man.
   For her part, Richards, a recovering alcoholic, was dogged
during the primary by allegations of drug use. She repeatedly
refused to say whether she had ever used illegal drugs.
   The focus turned to business after newspaper reports Aug. 5 said
that Williams' net worth has fallen by almost two-thirds since
1982, when he estimated it at $300 million, and that a researcher
hired by one of his primary opponents said half the 26 companies he
founded had been sold or dissolved.
   ``I am not backing up one bit on my business record,'' Williams
countered. ``I've had companies that broke even that I didn't keep
and some that were extremely successful.''
   The Democrats have paired the attack on his business dealings
with a demand that he make public his tax returns, something he has
refused to do.
   Williams recently said it would ``take a Mack truck'' to carry
his returns.
   Richards quickly sent a Mack truck to his headquarters.

   A Taiwanese air force plane carrying 18
senior military officers crashed near a village today and all the
passengers were feared dead.
   A spokesman for the Defense Ministry said the plane, a personnel
transport craft, was taking the officers, including several major
generals, to an important meeting when it crashed in Yunlin, a
village 150 miles south of Taipei.
   The air force said the plane was in two parts after plowing into
a sugar cane field in the central part of Taiwan.
   Taiwan's official Broadcasting Corp. of China said the aircraft
was broken into two following an explosion. A part of the plane
fell on the suger cane field and the rest was scattered in small
pieces, it said.
   The Defense Ministry spokesman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said everyone on board was feared dead. Rescue crews
were at the site, the air force said, but so far no survivors have
been found.

<HEAD>Pilot of Overloaded Plane May Have Tried to Beat Deadline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LORI BONA HUNT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WATERTOWN, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pilot of an overloaded plane that
crashed, killing all seven family members aboard, may have risked
flying in stormy weather to earn more flight time before a midnight
deadline, authorities say.
   The victims were all members of a Hmong refugee family attending
the birthday party of the pilot's daughter.
   The single-engine plane crashed in a corn field late Saturday
and was discovered the next morning.
   Pilot Jay Her, 31, of Watertown, was trying to earn flight time
required for his license while treating family members to a ride,
Sheriff Keith Mueller said Monday.
   ``I understand that pilots are required to certify themselves
every 90 days or else they have to be recertified,'' Mueller said.
``I understand that that's what this person was doing, and I also
understand that it had to be done before midnight on Saturday.''
   The rented Piper Lance was designed to carry a pilot and five
passengers, but Her squeezed two children into one seat, officials
said.
   Severe thunderstorms drenched the area Saturday night, but
officials were uncertain if bad weather caused the crash.
   The cause of the crash was under investigation by the National
Transportation Safety Board.
   Jeff Baum, manager of the Watertown airport, said Her was a
veteran pilot and it was ``inconceivable'' why he was flying with
an extra passenger in a storm.
   ``What went through his mind to leave in those weather
conditions and put seven people into a six-passenger plane I don't
know,'' Baum said.
   Besides Her, the victims were: Her's children, Amy, 7, and Tom,
3; his brother, Yuayia Her, 47, of Sheboygan; Yuayia Her's son,
Dani, 11; another brother, Vang Neng Her, 45, of Watertown, and
nephew Vang Yang, 13, of Milwaukee.
   Relatives said the group was celebrating Amy Her's seventh
birthday, and partygoers went for the plane ride during a break in
the rain.
   The Hmong family fled their native Laos to Thailand at the close
of the Vietnam War and made their way to Florida before resettling
in Wisconsin.
   The airport was unattended when Her took off, but Baum said
pilots are authorized to use the small airstrip after hours. A
search was launched after Her's wife telephoned authorities Sunday
morning to report her husband overdue.

<HEAD>Dollar, Stocks Fall in Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against the yen Tuesday, while
share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange suffered a moderate
decline.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 192.63
points, or 0.73 percent, to close at 26,297.84. The index shed
296.25 points on Monday.
   The dollar closed at 146.55 yen, down 0.92 yen from Monday's
finish. After opening at 146.30 yen, the currency ranged between
146.10 yen and 147.08 yen.
   In bond dealings, the No. 119 10-year Japanese government bond
was quoted at 83.11 points as of 3 p.m. (2 a.m. EDT), down from the
previous day's close of 83.33. The yield stood at 8.08 percent, up
from 8.03 percent.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's retreat followed its similar
downswing against the yen in New York overnight, though it was
mostly higher against other major currencies.
   ``There was dollar-buying by traders who considered the dollar's
downswing had been excessive,'' said Shigeto Yanase, a dealer with
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank.
   Yanase said the dollar was hovering ``around 146.70-146.80 yen''
following a report from New York that the United Nations's Security
Council was debating a measure to use armed forces in the Middle
East, where tension remains high after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Meanwhile, Persian Gulf oil prices remained slightly higher.
Dubai Fateh crude for October delivery was valued at about
$25.70-$25.80 a barrel, slightly higher than late Monday New York
levels.

<TEXT>
   An earthquake today jolted the city of
Rudbar in northern Iran, where a devastating quake killed 40,000
people in June, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
   Today's temblor measured 5 on the Richter scale and had an
epicenter 120 miles northwest of Tehran in the province of Gilan,
Tehran University's Geophysics Center told the news agency.
   The agency, monitored in Cyprus, said there was no report of
damage or casualties.
   Since the June 21 quake, which measured more than 7.3 on the
Richter scale, the region has been rocked frequently by minor and
severe tremors and aftershocks.
   Tens of thousands were injured and half a million people were
left homeless in June in the provinces of Gilan and Zanjan.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in
populated areas.

<HEAD>Bush Signs Trade Bill Affecting Northwest Logging, Duty-Free
Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has signed legislation
restricting state and federal log exports in an effort to save
thousands of timber jobs and extend federal protection of the
northern spotted owl.
   Bush said in signing the bill Monday that there was ``no doubt
that high levels of export of unprocessed timber have contributed
to the decline in habitat'' that caused the northern spotted owl to
be listed as threatened.
   ``While I am supporting this provision because it assists in the
preservation of critical habitat, I also note that it will ease the
economic transition in areas affected by the listing of the spotted
owl,'' Bush said.
   The log measure is intended to preserve the Pacific Northwest's
dwindling timber supply for domestic mills along with enough
old-growth stands to save the northern spotted owl from extinction.
   The bill makes permanent what had been a year-to-year ban on the
export of raw logs from federal land and imposes a new ban on state
lands in California and Oregon. Exports from state-owned land in
Washington would be reduced but not halted.

   The federal government wants to fine United
Parcel Service $200,000 for alleged violation of laws requiring
that job-related deaths and injuries be reported.
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration said Monday
the alleged violations took place at the company's Watertown,
Conn., facility.
   UPS, the nation's largest package delivery company, was cited
for failing to notify OSHA about a job-related death and failing to
record more than 100 other injuries and illnesses. The company also
failed to record the number of lost workdays caused by the
injuries, the agency said.
   John Flick, a spokesman for the company based in Greenwich,
Conn., said there would be no immediate comment because lawyers had
not reviewed the allegations, which were issued late in the day.

<HEAD>Plastic Decals on Baby Walker Pose Choking Hazard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delta Enterprise Corp. wants consumers to
remove and discard plastic labels and decals from its Delta Luv
Pop-Corn Baby Walker because they pose a choking hazard.
   The walkers have been associated with five incidents of choking,
the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Monday. All occurred
when children pulled off the decals on plastic toy dials on the
walker trays and placed them in their mouths.
   The six colorful round decals, which measure about 1{ inches in
diameter, should be removed immediately if they can be easily
dislodged, the commission said. Labels that are firmly stuck should
be checked periodically and removed if they become loose, the
commission said.
   Adults should also remove the plastic-coated ``Delta Luv'' label
with surrounding stripes found on the front of the tray, although
no complaints have been received about these labels, the commission
said.
   The paper warning label located under the tray should not be
removed.
   Approximately 100,000 of the walkers have been sold nationwide
since 1984.
   Owners with questions may write to Delta Enterprise Corp., 49
Junius St., Brooklyn, N.Y. 11212. The company can also be reached
by phone at 718-385-1000 between 8 a.m. and midnight EDT.

<HEAD>Tough Cop Named Police Chief in Atlanta</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bust-heads, tell-it-to-the-judge cop survived
two demotions to become police chief in the city with the nation's
highest crime rate.
   Mayor Maynard Jackson appointed Eldrin Bell on Monday,
declaring, ``Eldrin Bell is exactly what the doctor ordered.''
   Despite reservations by some city officials about Bell's alleged
lack of respect for the law, the City Council, meeting minutes
later, dispensed with the usual confirmation process and
unanimously approved the appointment.
   ``We don't need to be messing around,'' said Council President
Marvin S. Arrington. ``We need to put him on the job.''
   Bell, one of three deputy chiefs on the 1,600-member force,
takes over a police department with a big job in this city of about
445,000.
   In 1989, Atlanta reported 210 serious crimes for each 1,000
residents _ worst among U.S. cities with a population of 300,000 or
more, according to the FBI. It was the second straight year Atlanta
posted the worst crime rate.
   ``Let the word go forth,'' the 54-year-old Bell said at a news
conference. ``Lawlessness and drug trafficking and gangs are not
welcome in Atlanta. Atlanta will not tolerate this kind of
lawlessness.''
   Bell, who succeeds retiring Chief Morris Redding, stands to
become the city's most powerful police chief in nearly 16 years.
The mayor eliminated a commissioner post superior to the police and
fire chiefs earlier this year.
   Bell, who has what the mayor called ``a well-deserved reputation
as a tough cop,'' got little support from the man he replaced.
   Redding, who served eight years as chief, rated Bell's
``dependability and moral standards as low,'' although he said Bell
is a hard worker.
   Randolph W. Thrower, who heads the city Ethics Board, said Bell
``does not reflect great respect for ethical considerations.''
   Hilary L. Chiz, executive director for the Georgia chapter of
the American Civil Liberties Union, said she had some concerns, but
the ACLU wanted to work with the new chief ``on developing ways to
deal with the very serious issues of crime without encroaching
further on individual freedom.''
   Bell, 54, has served on the force for 29 years and twice was
demoted from deputy chief.
   In 1979, he was busted to major because of an investigation of
police protection for gamblers at fairgrounds where Bell did
security work. No charges were filed and he was reinstated.
   In 1985, he was again demoted, to lieutenant, after he was among
patrons at an Italian restaurant where invited guests were targets
of an FBI drug sting. It was determined that Bell hadn't been
invited and wasn't under investigation.
   Bell once reportedly picked up a billy club, phoned for an
ambulance, entered a crowded bar and fought seven suspects into
submission. He was investigated in 1984 for pistol-whipping a
motorist he had stopped, but a civilian panel, police board and a
federal court cleared him of using excessive force.
   As commander of a crime-ridden section of the city, he was known
for patrolling streets himself in the middle of the night and
popping in unannounced at headquarters to make sure the night shift
was answering calls promptly.
   Bell also was questioned in a 1975 promotion exam cheating
scandal. Investigators concluded he wasn't involved but may have
known about the cheating.
   Thrower, who headed the investigation, said Bell's evasiveness
and failure to cooperate ``thwarted justice.''

<TEXT>
   A blackout left much of the capital
without electricity for 10 hours, and the government said it
suspected sabotage by striking electric workers.
   Four of the five transmission lines that serve the city of 1
million were not functioning early Monday because of damaged
equipment, an official said.
   Renato London, head of operations at the state electric company,
said 80 percent of Brasilia was without power from 6 a.m. local
time to 4 p.m. Also hit by the power failure was Goiania, 130 miles
southwest of the capital.
   Presidential spokesman Claudio Humberto Rosa e Silva said
equipment at two power stations had been damaged by gunfire.
   ``This is an affront to society, to schools, industries, and we
will seek stern punishment for those responsible,'' Silva said.
   But Antonio Rodrigues do Amaral, president of the Brasilia
Electric Workers Union, blamed the government for the blackout,
which he said was caused by a ``lack of maintenance.''
   ``The government is to blame because they are not negotiating in
good faith,'' he said.
   Electric workers began a nationwide strike three weeks ago to
demand a 256 percent pay increase to cover losses to inflation.

   A Wisconsin appeals court has cleared the
way for the start this fall of a program that pays poor Milwaukee
children state money to attend private school.
   Several groups, including the state's biggest teachers union,
had sought an injunction blocking the program while they appeal a
Dane County Circuit Court decision earlier this month that ruled it
constitutional.
   But the Court of Appeals on Monday refused, saying there was no
evidence any irreparable harm would occur if the program went into
effect.
   The program, the first of its kind in the United States, offers
$2,500 in tuition assistance for up to 1,000 poor pupils to enroll
in private school. It is scheduled to start when fall classes begin
in about two weeks.
   Supporters and opponents of the program have 19 days from Monday
to file briefs in the appeals case.
   At the hearing, Charles Clausen, representing the Wisconsin
Education Association Council and the other groups, said the
program was unconstitutional because the Legislature failed to pass
it as a separate bill. It was an item in the budget bill.
   But attorneys for the state, six private schools and families
who support the program defended the Legislature, arguing it acted
decisively to improve the quality of education in urban areas.
   About 400 pupils have been accepted by 10 private Milwaukee-area
schools participating in the program, which won legislative
approval in April.

<HEAD>Government Nearly Doubles Reward Offered For Cartel Chief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STAN YARBRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has raised the reward for
the capture of the reputed leader of the Medellin cocaine cartel to
nearly $1 million, the army says.
   Thousands of handbills offering the doubled bounty were dropped
from army helicopters over the weekend in Medellin, according to a
statement Monday by Gen. Harold Bedoya, the commander of the army
brigade based in the city.
   Photographs of reputed cartel leader Pablo Escobar and other
cartel leaders appeared on the handbills, offering 500 million
pesos, nearly $1 million, for information leading to Escobar's
capture.
   Escobar, wanted in the United States on drug trafficking
charges, is also accused of masterminding several assassinations in
Colombia, including the August 1989 killing of Sen. Luis Carlos
Galan. Galan, a leading presidential contender, was gunned down at
a political rally outside of Bogota.
   After Galan's death, the government began extraditing
trafficking suspects and seizing their properties. The cartel
responded with a series of terrorist attacks that killed some 500
people before the organization declared a unilateral cease-fire
last month.
   This is the second time the government has raised the reward for
Escobar since it intensified a crackdown on the cartel. At the end
of 1989, the army announced it was increasing the bounty to
$500,000 from $250,000.
   The handbills also offered a reward of nearly $500,000 for Jorge
Luis Ochoa, considered by authorities to be the cartel's
second-in-command.
   The latest increase seemed to reaffirm the government's decision
not to deal with traffickers. Last week Justice Minister Jaime
Giraldo Angel said there would be no government negotiations with
organized crime despite the cartel's truce.
   But the minister added that an end to terrorism would allow the
government to end the extradition of accused drug traffickers. The
government has extradited 22 drug suspects since implementing the
policy last year.
   The Medellin cartel, which has been able to avoid Colombian
justice by bribing, threatening and killing judges, has tried both
to force and to coax the government into abandoning extradition.
   Security forces have continued to pursue the cartel's members.
Those killed in shootouts with police include Gonzalo Rodriguez
Gacha, called the most violent cartel figure, John Jairo Arias, the
leader of the organization's gunmen, and Gustavo de Jesus Gaviria,
Escobar's first cousin and right-hand man.

   The ``Exorcist III'' and ``Ghost'' conjured up
a lively audience, but ``The Two Jakes'' appeared to be D.O.A. at
the box office.
   The latest sequel in the ``Exorcist'' series made $9.3 million
for the No. 1 spot in its debut weekend with a tale about a string
of priest murders.
   ``Ghost,'' an afterlife romance starring Patrick Swayze and Demi
Moore, materialized in second place with $8.4 million and will pass
the $100 million mark this week, according to figures Monday from
Exhibitor Relations Co.
   In third was another morbid exercise, ``Flatliners.'' The movie
about medical students flirting with near-death experiences made
$7.1 million.
   Meanwhile, the private eye thriller ``The Two Jakes'' fell to
13th in its second week, making just $1.8 million. The sequel to
``Chinatown'' stars Jack Nicholson.
   In fourth with ticket sales of $6.2 million was ``My Blue
Heaven,'' starring Steve Martin and Rick Moranis as a mobster and
an FBI agent.
   ``Wild at Heart,'' a psychodrama from director David Lynch,
finished 10th in its first weekend. The violent, disturbing work
made $2.9 million playing on 532 screens.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Sunday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.
   1. ``Exorcist III,'' 20th Century Fox, $9.3 million, 1,288
screens, $7,230 per screen, $9.3 million, one week.
   2. ``Ghost,'' Paramount, $8.4 million, 1,766 screens, $4,736 per

<HEAD>Security Council Members Meet; Yemen to Turn Away Iraqi Tanker</HEAD>

   Yemen agreed today to turn away an Iraqi
oil tanker, lending further support to U.S.-led efforts to enforce
an international embargo on Iraqi goods.
   The agreement came in informal Security Council talks on
possible military action to back up the sanctions, convened at the
United States' urging.
   The meeting, which began Monday, was adjourned early this
morning following the announcement of Yemen's decision.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering said the United States
requested the meeting after receiving information of the imminent
arrival of the Iraqi tanker, which Saturday defied a U.S. warship
that fired across its bow.
   ``In the course of the evening, the Yemeni permanent
representative, told the council that Yemen would adhere to the
sanctions'' on Iraqi goods imposed after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait, Pickering said.
   The British ambassador, Sir Crispin Tickell, said the Yemeni
representative agreed to turn away the tanker.
   Yemen, the 15-member council's only Arab member, had abstained
from the sanctions vote but joined with the council in declaring
Iraq's annexation of Kuwait ``null and void.''
   Yemen also abstained from an Arab League vote on sanctions.
   Diplomats said the tanker would arrive in Yemeni waters within
hours.
   At the informal meeting, the council also accepted a U.S. draft
resolution calling for international military action to back up the
embargo of Iraq.
   The council agreed to convene at an ``early'' date to consider
the resolution. Pickering said the adjournment would allow council
members to consult with their governments before a final vote.
   The U.S. proposal called for members to take ``all necessary
action'' to enforce the U.N. embargo against Iraq.
   It would authorize the deployment of maritime forces and the use
of ``minimum force as may be necessary to verify the cargoes and
destinations of all ... shipping and to ensure the strict
enforcement'' of the embargo.
   The Cuban delegation presented a separate proposal calling for
the exclusion of foodstuffs, medicine and medical assistance from
the U.N. embargo.
   The United States has been criticized by some countries for
policing the U.N. embargo without council approval.
   France and the Soviet Union are believed supportive, while China
is said to be wary but unlikely to block an enforcement resolution.
   There is no exact precedent for the loose international military
action currently contemplated.
   Diplomats said the United States and Britain were not seeking to
invoke Article 42 of the U.N. Charter, providing for a
U.N.-sponsored blockade to enforce sanctions.
   That article has never been invoked. The last U.N. enforcement
action was launched in Korea in 1950. That operation, however, was
placed under a U.S. command and was not organized under Article 42.
   The only precedent for U.N. enforcement of sanctions came in
1966 when the Security Council called upon Britain to prevent, by
force if necessary, oil shipments to white-ruled Rhodesia, later
the object of a broad embargo.
   On Aug. 6, the Security Council adopted sweeping economic
sanctions against Iraq to punish the Baghdad government for its
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and subsequent annexation of that nation.
   The Security Council last met Saturday to condemn Iraq's holding
foreigners against their will. It demanded their immediate release.
   Under Chapter 7, Article 42 of the U.N. Charter, the Security
Council is empowered to take military action to enforce its
sanctions. The charter provies that the council ``may take such
action by air, sea or land forces as may be necessary to maintain
or restore international peace and security.''
   Such action, it says, may include a blockade.

<HEAD>Zairean Students End Weeklong Occupation of Embassy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLENE L. FU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 40 Zairean students today ended a weeklong
occupation of their embassy in Beijing after getting assurances
from their government that it would send promised living allowances
and plane tickets home.
   The students began returning to their schools after holding
their ambassador and his staff hostage in the walled compound since
Aug. 15.
   The decision to leave was made after a 30-minute phonecall from
the Zairean ambassador in Belgium, Kimbulu Moyanso, who assured the
students that approximately $187,500 in unpaid living allowances
would be forwarded to Beijing within 10 days, said Qinghua
University graduate Ngolo Kilubisha.
   Government funds from Zaire, a former Belgian colony, are first
transferred to banks in Belgium before being disbursed overseas.
   Most of the more than 80 Zaire students in China have not been
paid since June 1989, with some going without their Zaire
government subsidies for two years. The students also get $54 per
month from the Chinese government.
   The students today received a telex from their education
minister asking for a breakdown of money owed to each student and
other details of their complaints.
   The students said the head of Zaire's Culture Center in Belgium,
which is responsible for its students studying overseas, is to come
to Beijing on Thursday to talk with the students.
   Kilubisha said the students regarded these moves as signs the
government was prepared to resolve their problems, which also
included failure to provide promised plane tickets home for
graduates after five-year stays in China.
   It was the second consecutive year the students have protested
over the same problems. Last year, they occupied the embassy for 10
days until the Zaire government refused to resolve the problems
unless the students withdrew.
   Kilubisha said the students voted Monday night to retreat, but
warned, ``If we don't get any solution (based on) what they've
said, we might come back.''
   The students had secured the gate of the walled embassy compound
with a bicycle lock, refusing to allow the ambassador or his staff
out or the Chinese staff in.
   Kilubish said the lock was removed and the embassy was operating
normally today.
   The Zaireans are one of the largest groups of African students
in China. Under friendship agreements signed in the 1960s, China
gives scholarships to students from many African countries to
complete entire degree programs in China, usually in the sciences.

<HEAD>Leftist Guerrillas Attack Barracks, Five Civilians Hurt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCOS ALEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas attacked an
army barracks in the capital across the street from President
Alfredo Cristiani's residence. Five people were wounded in the
battle, the military said.
   The military sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the rebels used bombs hurled from homemade catapults and also
mortars in the attack late Monday, but none of the rounds hit the
barracks.
   The barracks houses a military communication unit on the south
side of the capital.
   Hundreds of army troops, backed by helicopter gunships,
immediately cordoned off the area and exchanged automatic rifle
fire for about 30 minutes with the rebels before the attackers
withdrew shortly after nightfall.
   The guerrillas also dynamited a half-dozen electrical towers,
leaving large areas in the southern part of the city without power.
   Radio stations reported that Cristiani's residence was hit by a
mortar explosion, but an official there denied this.
   Cristiani ``was not here at the time of the attack. They did not
attack the presidential house,'' the official, who also spoke on
condition of anonymity, said in a telephone interview.
   ``This was an attack mainly against the civilian population,''
one of the military sources said.
   Journalists who toured the area after the fighting saw at least
three houses in the neighborhood damaged by guerrilla mortar fire.
Red Cross volunteers at the scene said they picked up five
civilians wounded by shrapnel fire and rushed them to hospital.
   The guerrilla attack came as peace talks in San Jose, the
capital of neighboring Costa Rica, stalled Monday over rebel
demands that the army be abolished and officers be punished for
politically motivated murders.
   Oscar Santamaria, justice minister and head of the government
delegation, described the addition of new guerrilla demands since
the July round of talks as a setback.
   He said the new demands were ``not in accord with the
seriousness of the peace process.''
   The rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front submitted an
18-point document. Its first demand calls for ``the total
demilitarization of society, by means of disappearance of the two
armies.''
   The rebels, in previous rounds of talks, had demanded trial and
punishment of officers implicated in four noted human rights cases,
including the 1980 assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero and
last November's massacre by army troops of six Jesuit priests,
their housekeeper and her daughter.
   The new document adds demands for punishment of those
responsible for two other cases, as well as ``the murders,
massacres and bombardments of civilians that have occurred during
the negotiations.''
   The document also demands investigations to determine
responsibility for 20 other specific crimes in addition to ``all
the crimes, murders, disappearances and massacres committed since
1979.''
   More than 73,000 people have been killed since the war began in
October 1979, the majority of them civilians.

<HEAD>Share Prices Down; Dollar Also Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continued uncertainty over the Middle East sent
share prices falling for the fourth consecutive trading day in
Tokyo today, and the U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained
moderately in the morning but dropped in light afternoon trading,
closing at 26,297.84 points, down 192.63 points, or 0.73 percent.
The index fell 296.25 points on Monday.
   Yoshihide Koyama, an analyst with Nikko Securities, said share
prices moved up because of purchases by investment trust funds in
the morning, but suffered from sporadic arbitrage selling in the
afternoon.
   ``The index was easily affected by a thin trading volume,''
Koyama said.
   A total of 280 million shares changed hands on the market's
first section, up slightly from Monday's slim 206 million shares.
   The Nikkei index has lost a total of 4,540.15 points, or 14.7
percent, since its closing of 30,837.99 on Aug. 1, the day before
the Middle East crisis began with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 146.55 yen, down 0.92
yen from Monday's finish. It opened at 146.30 yen and ranged
between 146.10 yen and 147.08 yen.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's retreat followed its
downswing against the yen in New York overnight, although it was
mostly higher against other major currencies.
   ``The sentiment toward the dollar basically remains weak in
relation to the yen, with the day's trading mostly focused on cross
trading,'' in which traders sell European currencies to buy the
yen, said Masahiro Yanagida, a dealer with Sanwa Bank.
   Yanagida said the dollar could be affected either way by
developments in the Middle East.
   On the bond market, the price of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds closed at 83.22 points, down from their
83.33-point closing Monday. Their yield stood at 8.060 percent, up
from 8.030 percent.
   Meanwhile, Persian Gulf oil prices moved slightly higher. Dubai
Fateh crude for October delivery was valued at about $25.70-$25.80
a barrel, marginally higher than late Monday New York levels.
   Prices for October delivery of North Sea Brent were
$27.70-$27.85 a barrel, higher than the $27.40 quoted late Monday
in New York.

   The rancher daughter of a former Wyoming
governor faced a state lawmaker today for the GOP nomination for
her father's old job. Gov. Mike Sullivan had only token opposition
on the Democratic side.
   Mary Mead and 12-year Rep. Nyla Murphy seemed to agree more
often than not. They are pro-choice on abortion, favor the death
penalty, oppose other states dumping garbage in Wyoming and fault
Sullivan's running of the economy.
   ``Wyoming is on the skids. He's had four years to turn it
around, and it hasn't changed,'' said Mead, daughter of Cliff
Hansen, a former governor and U.S. senator.
   Sullivan has largely ignored his race against Ron ``Suds''
Clingman, a motorcycle repairman who wants to return the drinking
age to 18, legalize gambling, decriminalize drugs and cut the
salaries of public officials.
   Clingman also believes murderers facing execution should have
the option of turning their living bodies over to medical
experimentation.
   Also on the primary ballot are Republicans U.S. Sen. Alan
Simpson and U.S. Rep. Craig Thomas. Simpson faced two political
unknowns for a third term. Thomas, appointed to fill Dick Cheney's
term when he was named defense secretary, is unopposed. His
Democratic opponent, Pete Maxfield, also is unopposed.

   A Taiwanese air force plane carrying three
top military officers crashed and exploded on a sugar cane field in
heavy rain today, killing all 18 people on board, the Defense
Ministry said.
   A ministry statement said the Beech-1900 turboprop transport
craft was carrying three major generals and their aides on an
``inspection mission'' when it crashed in Yunlin, a village 150
miles south of Taipei. Three crew members also died in the crash.
   The generals were identified as air force deputy chief of staff
Lin Lung-hsien, air force operations director Ning Chien-chuang and
Combined Services Forces' Ordinance Director Tsao Yao-yi.
   Biographical information on the three was not immediately
available because is considered a military secret in Taiwan.
   The mass-circulation China Times Express said the officers were
on their way to inspect a military airport being built in central
Taiwan in Chiayi, near Yunlin.
   The newspaper said the aircraft hit the ground and exploded. The
force of the blast split the aircraft in two, burying the cockpit
in the muddy field and scattering the rest of the plane in pieces,
the paper said.
   The Defense Ministry said it was investigating the cause of the
crash. Officials said the aircraft was bought from the U.S. Beech
Aircraft Corp. in 1988.

   Former U.S. Sen. Lawton Chiles, his
campaign for governor dogged by questions about his mental health,
released medical records that said he never contemplated suicide
during his bouts with depression.
   Chiles, 60, released the inch-thick collection of records Monday
after calls for disclosure from his opponent.
   At a news conference at which the records were released, Chiles'
physician, Dr. Karl Hempel, said the former senator has been
treated for depression since 1987.
   The condition, which afflicts an estimated 4 percent of the
adult U.S. population, can be debilitating and lead to suicide, but
Chiles is less severely affected, the doctor said.
   ``He's never been suicidal from the very start,'' said Hempel.
``I would definitely not tell him to retire. He doesn't have
anything that is even close to being disabling.''
   Chiles is running against U.S. Rep. Bill Nelson, 47, for the
Democratic nomination in the Sept. 4 primary. Nelson's running
mate, Tom Gustafson, suggested Chiles could be suicidal as governor
but later apologized for the remark.
   Campaigning on Monday, Chiles said the records ``should put an
end'' to questions about his mental and physical health.
   Republican Gov. Bob Martinez and Chiles' Democratic opponent had
earlier released complete medical records, and Nelson repeatedly
urged Chiles to do the same.
   ``I think that my health is perhaps a legitimate issue,'' Chiles
said, adding that his daily campaigning shows that he is fit.
   He had his first episode of depression following open-heart
surgery in 1985, but that was brief and resolved without treatment,
Hempel told reporters.
   The medical documents dating to 1966 showed that in 1987, Chiles
complained of insomnia and loss of appetite and sex drive _ common
symptoms of depression. He was treated with the anti-depressant
doxepin. A month later, Chiles made the surprise announcement he
wouldn't seek a fourth Senate term.
   In the evaluation, Dr. R.J. Pentzien, a psychiatrist at Bethesda
Naval Hospital, wrote: ``There was no history of suicidal ideation,
plan or intent.''
   Chiles was switched to the popular new anti-depressant Prozac in
1989 by Hempel. The drug's makers deny claims in several lawsuits
that it can spur suicidal tendencies.
   Hempel said Chiles would be fine as long as he monitors his
condition, which is being treated with anti-depression drugs to
correct a chemical imbalance in the brain.
   Chiles, who served in the Legislature in a political career
dating to 1959, said he released the records because he didn't want
to appear to be hiding anything.

<HEAD>Philadelphia's Mayor Pleads For Action on Fiscal Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LYNN BERRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode says Philadelphia is
not bankrupt and can avoid a disastrous $206.4 million deficit if
the state and City Council work with him to raise taxes and cut
spending.
   ``These actions may be painful,'' he said Monday. ``But had they
been taken in the past, as I recommended, they would not be
necessary now. To avoid tough times ahead, we cannot avoid tough
choices today.''
   Goode urged the Legislature to give the city power to raises
taxes by $150 million, to be spread among consumers, homeowners and
businesses.
   He also called for a freeze on hiring and a cut in all
non-essential services, which he did not list.
   And he proposed the lease or sale of Veterans Stadium, where the
Philadelphia Phillies and Eagles play, and of other city assets,
including the Water Department.
   Goode's call for action came as his administration announced
plans Monday to borrow $400 million in temporary loan notes within
the next two weeks.
   Without the notes, the city would be out of cash by late
September, according to a report by City Finance Director Betsy
Reveal.
   Even with the notes, the city will be out of cash by May unless
short- and long-term measures are taken, the report said.
   Goode accused previous administrations of taking stopgap
measures to avoid crises. He pointed to federal grants that have
dried up and the recession gripping the Northeast. But he reserved
the largest share of blame for the state.
   ``The root of our dilemma is that Philadelphia's fiscal problems
are primarily structural _ they are built into the state system,''
he said.
   Gov. Robert P. Casey defended his administration, saying he has
``substantially increased the state's financial contribution to the
city.''
   Goode also blasted the City Council, noting it has repeatedly
thwarted his attempts to raise taxes over the years.

   East German leaders have been bickering about when to enact a
clause in the West German constitution that will allow the nation
to accede to its Western neighbor.
   The left-leaning Social Democrats, who left de Maiziere's broad
coalition government on Sunday, had said they would seek to have
unification take place on Sept. 15 because of the nation's serious
economic problems.
   De Maiziere told reporters about the agreement following a
meeting with the leaders of the parties in Parliament.
   It appears now that the timetable for German unity is now almost
solidified. Elections for a united German government have been
tentatively set for Dec. 2.
   The timing and pace of unification, and feuding among
politicians who essentially are campaigning to lead the new German
nation, has virtually decimated the East German government.

<HEAD>Lawmen Identify Mystery Cowboy Accused of Theft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mysterious phony cowboy suspected of
stealing and selling horses and saddles across the country has a
name _ and it's not Slim, Tex or Buffalo Bill.
   The alleged thief had been using the name of a man who died in
January, and authorities say he used as many as 35 aliases in the
last seven years. He used so many false names that officers who
arrested him earlier this month couldn't determine his real
identity.
   That changed when an anonymous caller who had seen his picture
in a newspaper fingered him, Sheriff Jerry Cox said Monday.
   The mystery man known for wearing outlandish cowboy outfits and
calling everybody ``pardner'' was identified as John Richard Brink,
a 39-year-old native of Quincy, Ill., Cox said.
   Cox said that after Brink learned his cover was blown, he
admitted to the name changes.
   ``He said, `I've done this for the last six or seven years,' ''
Cox said. ``He said this was the first time he had gotten caught
and wanted to know how I had done it.''
   Brink is in jail on $160,000 bail on burglary and theft charges.
He also faces charges in Indiana and two other Missouri counties,
Cox said. Authorities in Tennessee and Pennsylvania want to
question him.
   Investigators believe he traveled from New York to Texas,
stealing horses, riding tack and other goods to sell further down
the road.
   He was captured after he allegedly took part in a burglary near
here. Two alleged accomplices led authorities to Brink, known for
wearing gaudy lizard-skin boots, a black Stetson hat and silver
belt buckle.
   After his arrest at a Springfield motel, law officers found
stolen saddles and other riding equipment in a storage locker he
had rented.

<HEAD>Report: Bankruptcy Courts Under Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors say they have launched
a criminal investigation of Northern California's bankruptcy courts.
   U.S. Attorney William T. McGivern Jr. confirmed the probe, the
San Francisco Daily Journal, a law publication, reported today.
   ``Over the last several months, matters involving the practice
of bankruptcy law in general have been referred to this office ...
and are under investigation by the FBI and this office,'' McGivern
said.
   McGivern declined to comment further, but an assistant U.S.
attorney told the journal that the probe began at least three
months ago at his instance.
   ``I see obstruction of justice, I see violations of bankruptcy
statutes ... bankruptcy fraud,'' the unidentified prosecutor was
quoted as saying. ``I am seriously concerned about the bankruptcy
system.''
   The prosecutor said complaints in the past year came from
debtors, creditors and attorneys. Most of the cases involved
Chapter 11 reorganizations, in which attorneys and trustees often
have wide discretion over assets.
   ``There is a club,'' the prosecutor said. ``If you are on the
right side of the club, you seem to win in the bankruptcy court. If
you are on the wrong side, you seem to lose in the bankruptcy court.
   ``It was my opinion that the little people were the ones that
were getting the short end of the stick; the people who couldn't
afford to hire lawyers, go in with some high-priced legal talent,
weren't getting a fair shake.''

   Thunderstorms were possible along the border of Georgia and
Florida and were also forming in Missouri, Illinois and Indiana.
Sunshine and highs in the 80s were expected throughout the Great
Plains.
   Showers were possible in the Dakotas and a large storm system
was developing over Idaho, Montana and Washington. The Southwest

   The dollar settled in today at generally higher
levels set in overnight trading, and regained some lost ground
against the Japanese yen.
   Gold prices were lower in what dealers described as a nervous
market.
   A trader for an Italian bank in Milan said the dollar seemed to
have settled in a narrow range, but was likely to resume its upward
correction later in the day.
   ``If the dollar breaks above 1.5720 marks, it could go sharply
higher to 1.5750 marks or 1.58 marks before the end of the day,''
he said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 146.55 yen, down 0.92 yen from
Monday's finish. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 146.71
yen.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's retreat in Tokyo followed a
similar drop in Europe and New York on Monday.
   ``There was dollar-buying by traders who considered the dollar's
downswing had been excessive,'' said Shigeto Yanase, a dealer with
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank in Tokyo.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _1.5675 West German marks, up from 1.5625
   _1.299 Swiss francs, up from 1.294
   _5.27 French francs, up from 5.2375
   _1.7660 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7585
   _1,159.50 Italian lire, up from 1,151
   --1.1415 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1437
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9105, compared
with $1.9185 late Monday.
   Gold dealers in London fixed a recommended price of $407.85 a
troy ounce Monday morning, down from $409.75 bid late Monday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $408.45, down from $409.75 late
Monday.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $5.13 a troy ounce,
down from Monday's $5.14.

   Operation PUSH brought its war of words
against Nike to the athletic shoe company's doorstep _ but wasn't
allowed into enemy territory.
   Nike executives on Monday refused to meet with members of the
Chicago-based civil rights group, continuing its defiance of PUSH's
call for a national boycott of Nike products.
   PUSH leader the Rev. Tyrone Crider said the group was in Oregon
for a meeting with Nike brass, but company spokeswoman Liz Dolan
said earlier that Nike informed PUSH by telephone on Friday that
executives would not meet with Crider.
   Nike security chief Patrick McElroy turned the group away at the
door.
   The PUSH delegation remained outside the building, demonstrating
for an end to what they call discriminatory business practices by
Nike. Protesters wore T-shirts that read: ``Say No to Nike.''
   ``We will not rest until we bring Nike down to its knees,''
Chicago city Alderman Dorothy Tillman said after being turned away
from Nike offices.
   Two weeks ago PUSH called for the national boycott, saying Nike
denies blacks adequate employment and business opportunities.
   Nike says its minority policies and programs could serve as
industry models.
   Its sneakers are promoted in television commercials by black
sports stars like Michael Jordan, Bo Jackson and David Robinson, as
well as black filmmaker Spike Lee.
   PUSH has succeeded in winning ``covenants'' promising blacks
greater opportunities from companies such as Coca Cola and Burger
King.
   Nike executives met once in Chicago with PUSH leaders. PUSH
demanded that Nike increase black employment and direct more of its
business to black-owned banks and advertising agencies.
   Another meeting was set in Beaverton, but Nike cancelled it.
Nike executives claimed that their chief competitor, Reebok
International Ltd., engineered the dispute in hopes of boosting
sales.
   PUSH stands for People United to Save Humanity. The group was
founded by the Rev. Jesse Jackson.

   Iraqi forces near the Kuwait border
are in disarray, reduced to stealing water and siphoning gasoline
from civilian cars, British intelligence sources have said.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Monday
that capabilities of the 120,000-member force have been exaggerated.
   They believe Iraqi re-supply lines are so inefficient that a
full-scale invasion of Saudi Arabia is all but impossible. Some
Iraqi soldiers are as young as 16.
   Air Vice Marshal Sandy Wilson, commander of British forces in
Saudi Arabia, said: ``There is a danger of giving too much credit
to Saddam's capabilities.''
   Wilson said, however, he did not underestimate the
professionalism of Iraqi pilots. The Iraqis have a small number of
Soviet Mig-29 and French Mirage F1 fighter aircraft.
   Britain's 12 Tornado F3 fighters are flying regularly with U.S.
and Saudi warplanes. The planes have made radar contact with Iraqi
aircraft, Wilson said, but refused to give any details.
   Wilson said an integrated command structure has been established
for the U.S., British and Saudi air forces, although each remains
under national command.
   During flights, the planes are co-ordinated and controlled by
U.S. and Saudi Awacs _ airborne early warning radar aircraft.
   The multinational military build-up continues at Dhahran, in the
kingdom's northeastern corner, and every day the air defense shield
is strengthened, the sources said.
   ``It is a comfort to me that, as a result, the Iraqis' ability
to get chemical weapons through is increasingly reduced,'' Wilson
said.
   He described the shield as not invincible but ``pretty capable.''
   Rapier anti-aircraft missile batteries sent from Britain were
being held in Cyprus because the British had decided the air
defenses provided by the United States and Saudi Arabia were more
than adequate, Wilson said.
   British intelligence sources, meanwhile, described most of the
Iraqi troops dug in 10 to 15 miles behind the border as young and
``shaky.''
   ``Their re-supply lines are a shambles, and they have been
reduced to stealing water and siphoning petrol from civilian
vehicles,'' one intelligence source said.

<TEXT>
   Government and black leaders
pleaded today for an end to tribal violence that has killed at
least 399 people, and they urged the warring factions to work
together for peace.
   Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha met Zulu leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi and Gen. Bantu Holomisa, leader of the predominantly
Xhosa homeland of Transkei, to discuss fighting in black townships
around Johannesburg between Zulus and Xhosas.
   ``The need, whatever the cause is, is to put an immediate end to
the bloodshed. All political leaders have a responsibility in this
respect which they must accept by putting aside political
objectives,'' the leaders said in a statement. They also called for
church leaders to oppose the violence.
   But the African National Congress was not represented at the
45-minute meeting in Pretoria. Zulus loyal to Buthelezi's
conservative Inkatha movement and mostly Xhosa followers of the ANC
have been fighting since Aug. 12.
   Buthelezi was to meet later with President F.W. de Klerk.
   ``Not only must the bloodshed cease, the war of words must
cease,'' the statement said. ``This has often been interprteted at
grassroots level as license for violence.''
   The Zulus and Xhosas _ _ the country's two largest black tribes
_ have battled with guns, machetes, spears, clubs and axes in the
worst township violence in years.
   A police spokeswoman said two cars and a house were burned today
in the KwaThema, while police disarmed bands of Zulus and Xhosas
who had gathered in Tembiza.
   Groups continued to gather in Tembiza, Lt. Ida Van Zweel said,
but no new violence there was reported.
   Also Tuesday, a bomb exploded in a car at a Johannesburg hotel
believed frequented by ANC supporters. The blast broke several
windows, but nobody was injured, police said.
   The bomb, made of commercial explosives, appeared similar to
weapons used by extreme right-wing whites opposed to government
moves toward sharing power with the black majority.
   De Klerk met last week with ANC deputy president Nelson Mandela
to seek a halt to the violence.
   Buthelezi and Mandela have made separate calls in the past for
an end to the violence, but their followers have continued to fight.
   Police figures today raised the overall death toll in township
violence to 399 since Aug. 12, including 120 in Tokoza, 112 in
Soweto, 56 in KwaThema, 42 in Katlehong and 38 in Tembiza. Police
said they found more bodies overnight.
   The Johannesburg clashes marked a spread of the political
violence from eastern Natal Province, where Inkatha-ANC fighting
has killed some 5,000 blacks over the past five years.
   The ANC has rejected a direct meeting with Buthelezi since
fighting began in Johannesburg. Mandela previously canceled a
meeting with Buthelezi earlier this year, reportedly because of
pressure from ANC leaders in Natal.
   But Buthelezi claimed today he had met with what he called top
ANC officials in recent weeks to discuss the violence. He would not
identify them. He also criticized Mandela for refusing to meet
previously.
   The ANC contends Buthelezi is trying to broaden Inkatha's
constituency beyond Natal by instigating violence against ANC
backers in the Johannesburg area townships.
   It also claims meeting with him would reward such a strategy by
giving the Zulu leader legitimacy as a power broker in the black
opposition movement.
   Buthelezi and other Inkatha leaders contend the ANC is not
willing to tolerate rivals and seeks to monopolize political power.
Inkatha says it must be included in negotiations between the
government and the ANC on ending white-minority rule.
   Both the ANC and Inkatha oppose apartheid, the system of racial
segregation that allows 5 million whites to maintain political and
economic control over 30 million blacks.
   But the two groups differ over tactics and plans for a future
South Africa.

   President Hosni Mubarak urged Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein today to withdraw his forces from Kuwait
to avoid ``a destructive war that will devour everything.''
   Mubarak said he was timing his appeal ``at these critical,
decisive and difficult hours.''
   Announcers read Mubarak's statement on the state-owned national
television and Cairo Radio. It was preceded and followed by
nationalist songs and martial music, with film clips emphasizing
Arab unity showing Mubarak and Arab leaders, including Saddam.
   The president said he was making his appeal ``in the name of
everything sacred on our Arab soil ... in the name of Islam, the
religion of peace ... in the name of Arab nationalism ... in the
name of every man, woman and child on our Arab land.''
   In urging an Iraqi pullout from Kuwait, conquered on Aug. 2 and
annexed six days later, Mubarak also asked for restoration of the
ousted government of Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah.
   The president expressed confidence that if Saddam did as he
asked, the Arabs would be able to settle the Iraq-Kuwait dispute
peacefullly.
   ``In the name of light, good and right, I appeal to President
Saddam Hussein to save both man and entity in our Arab world from a
destructive war that will devour everything,'' Mubarak said.
   ``God only knows what the terrifying outcome will be if war
begins, or how much damage there will be if the fire erupts, taking
us backward into total darkness and loss.
   ``I appeal to President Saddam Hussein to make the decision to
withdraw Iraqi forces from the land of Kuwait so that conditions
there would return to what they were.''
   Mubarak said Arabs everywhere look to Saddam to ``take this
initiative, which would be appreciated in the Arab world and the
whole world west and east, north and south.''

<TEXT>
   Iraq has moved as many as 800 Soviet-built or
Iraqi-modified ballistic missiles into Kuwait, the editor of Jane's
Soviet Intelligence Review said today.
   Henry Dodds said he had learned from a Saudi Arabian source
Monday that up to 36 missile launchers and as many as 800 missiles
are in Kuwait.
   It was unclear, he added, whether the missiles were the Soviet
Scud B, which has been sold to Iraq, or the al-Husayn, a
longer-range Iraqi version.
   ``There are 36 launchers in Kuwait and they seem to be Scud
launchers,'' Dodds said in a telephone interview.
   ``But there are also missiles being moved about on flatbed
trucks. Unless you can get close enough to measure, there is no way
of telling the difference between Scuds and al-Husayns.''
   Dodds said the Al-Husayn is based on the Soviet Scud B, but its
range of 400 miles is more than double the range of the Soviet
version.
   ``Obviously that will make a tremendous difference to the
targets that the Iraqis could hit if they decide to fire those
missiles from Kuwait,'' Dodds said.
   He said the reported deployment was large, ``but it obviously is
not all the missiles the Iraqis have got.
   ``They would be foolish to move everything they have up into
Kuwait. So one must only assume that they have possibly at least
the same number again, possibly more, somewhere in Iraq,'' he said.
   The American, British and Saudi air forces based at Dhahran,
about 250 miles from Kuwait, would be well within the missile's
range.
   Iraq first demonstrated its longer-range missile capability on
Feb. 29, 1988 when a missile struck the Iranian capital of Tehran,
about 400 miles from the Iraqi border.
   In its May issue, Jane's Soviet Intelligence Review said 189
such missiles were fired at Iranian cities in the seven succeeding
weeks during the so-called war of the cities.
   The Soviet Union first supplied Scud B missiles to Iraq in the
early 1970s and delievered hundreds during the Iran-Iraq War,
Jane's said.
   According to Iranian reports, the al-Husayns achieved their
longer range partly by reducing the explosive payload _ from 1,650
pounds for a Scud B to 418 pounds for an al-Husayn.
   Many of the warheads used against Iran were defective and did
not explode, Jane's said, adding that the missile did not appear to
highly accurate.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sirens howled today to commemorate
the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion on the first anniversary that
Czechoslovaks were able to mark without fear of police retaliation.
   In Prague, Mayor Jaroslav Koran honored seven Soviets who
protested the invasion that ended the ``Prague Spring'' of
liberalization and replaced it with more than two decades of
hard-line Communism.
   Making the Soviets honorary Prague citizens, Koran told them
their demonstration in Moscow's Red Square on Aug. 25, 1968,
``salvaged the conscience of their silent country.''
   ``They protested against the ... shameful treason committed by
the tyrants of the day on a small friendly country,'' Koran
declared.
   The mayor, acting on a city council declaration last week, also
formally stripped Soviet dictator Josef Stalin of honorary
citizenship, along with Czechoslovakia's first Communist president
and Gustav Husak, the Communist Party leader installed by Moscow in
the wake of the invasion.
   Present at the ceremonies was Yelena Bonner, the widow of Soviet
dissident Andrei Sakharov, who criticized the invasion.
   Bestowing the keys of the city to Ms. Bonner, Koran declared:
``She's always had the key to our hearts.''
   Among the dignitaries gathered for the ceremony at City Hall
were Soviet Ambassador Boris Pankin and Alexander Dubcek, the
reformist Communist Party leader who engineered the 1968 reforms
only to see them crushed by the invading tanks.
   Dubcek, 69, who came back from more than two years of official
disgrace to become speaker of the nation's first free Parliament
since 1948, chatted affably with Pankin.
   Their rapport was a striking example of the new reality in
Eastern Europe, where democracies have replaced monolithic
Communist rule in many countries.
   Just one year ago, riot police waded into thousands of
protesters commemorating the Soviet-led invasion and those who had
fought it and calling for democracy.
   Less than three months later, even larger protests led to the
resignation of Czechoslovakia's Communist government and subsequent
free elections.
   Earlier today a T-55 tank appeared in Wenceslas Square, where
weeping Czechoslovaks pelted Soviet armor with rocks and garbage 22
years ago. This time, the spectators cheered.
   The Soviet-made tank was tipped onto its side by a crane and
will be left standing through Sept. 6.
   Its belly bore the logos of Solidarity, the trade union movement
that spearheaded democratization in Poland, and Civic Forum,
President Vaclav Havel's political movement that guided
Czechoslovakia's peaceful democratic revolution late last year.
   At daybreak, costumed members of the ``Jester Society'' student
group swarmed through subway stations in a mock invasion of the
city.
   It was a normal working day, and most people went about their
morning business. Near Wenceslas Square, only a few craned their
necks to listen to a two-minute cacophony of sirens at noon.
   But some took time to reminisce.
   Marie Kratochvilova related that she awoke Aug. 21, 1968 to a
commotion in a neighboring apartment. She complained and found the
neighbors making plans to flee the country.
   ```You're snoring away happily and don't realize that the
Russians are occupying our country,''' the 56-year-old vendor
recalled her neighbors as saying.
   On Monday, Civic Forum condemned domestic Communist leaders said
to have invited foreign troops into the country in 1968.
   ``We continue to support the demand that these people who
committed high treason and are guilty of opposing peace be put to
trial,'' said a Civic Forum statement.
   No charges have been lodged against any of the deposed
leadership for their role in the invasion, partially because of
lack of evidence.

   Someone has made off with more than $1
million in diamonds and pearls from oil heiress Carolyn Skelly's
mansion, the third time in seven years that her Bois Dore estate
has been hit by jewelry thieves.
   In 1982, she also was robbed at gunpoint of $1 million in
jewelry in New York City.
   Mrs. Skelly, believed to be in her 80s, said the jewelry taken
in the latest heist Friday was not insured and she may just sell
what's left.
   ``I stopped insuring my jewelry years ago. It got to be so
expensive,'' she told The Providence Journal-Bulletin in an
interview published today.
   Police had some suspects, said Lt. Donn Woods, but he did not
elaborate.
   The investigation would include questioning all the guests at a
champagne dinner dance Mrs. Skelly held a few hours before the
theft, he said. Among the 75 to 100 guests was Columba Bush,
President Bush's daughter-in-law, who was also a houseguest at the
mansion for the night.
   Mrs. Skelly said she wore the jewelry during the party, then
took it off before going to sleep at 1:30 a.m. The three rings, a
diamond necklace, a diamond bracelet and a string of pearls were
missing from her jewelry chest when she awoke at 8 a.m.
   She estimated she slept less than 15 feet from the unlocked
jewelry chest, but ``I didn't hear a thing.''
   In 1982, Mrs. Skelly was abducted at New York's LaGuardia
Airport and robbed of $1 million in jewelry.
   Two years later, a former maid was arrested on charges of
stealing more than $2 million in jewelry while Mrs. Skelly was away.
   In August 1986, she was confronted in her bedroom by a
knife-wielding robber who stole a pillowcase full of jewelry valued
at between $3 million and $5 million. It never was recovered.
   ``The world is getting scary today with all of these
criminals,'' she said.

<HEAD>Man Credited With Inventing Deep-Dish Pizza Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ike Sewell, the restaurateur credited with
inventing ``Chicago-style,'' deep-dish pizza, has died at 87.
   Sewell died Monday of leukemia at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.
   Sewell's first love was the Mexican food he grew up on in Wills
Point, Texas. But his partner in an early restaurant venture didn't
like it, so they hit upon the idea of pizza.
   Sewell decided he he wanted something more filling than regular
pizza. The pair began experimenting and hit upon the deep-dish
style.
   They opened Pizzeria Uno in 1943, and their deep-dish pizza made
in an oversized pie tin became one of Chicago's culinary trademarks.
   The popularity of the restaurant led Sewell to open Pizzeria Due
down the street in 1955. Eight years later, he opened Su Casa,
heralded as Chicago's first upscale Mexican restaurant.
   Sewell eventually agreed to allow others to franchise his
pioneering pizza concept, and there are now more than 50 ``Original
Chicago Pizzeria Uno'' restaurants across the nation.
   ``Chicago-style and deep-dish pizza are interchangeable terms,''
said Pizzeria Uno manager Page Townsley. ``It began here in 1943.
It began right here in this restaurant, in this kitchen.''
   Survivors include Sewell's wife, Florence Davis, and a niece.
   Services are scheduled for Wednesday in Chicago.

<HEAD>Lawyer Indicted in Serial Killing Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than two years after the first of
nine murdered women was found near here, a serial murder case
involving drugs, prostitution and now politics finally has its
first official suspect.
   A Bristol County grand jury Monday charged lawyer Kenneth C.
Ponte, 40, with the April 27, 1988, murder of Rochelle Clifford
Dopierla. Ponte said he was innocent but he welcomed the indictment
because his name circulated publicly for months.
   ``Mr. Ponte recognizes the fact that he has a very, very strong
case before a trial jury,'' his defense attorney Kenneth Reddington
said at Monday's bail hearing in Bristol County Superior Court.
``He needs a trial to clear his name.''
   Dopierla was one of nine murder victims whose bodies were found
along wooded roadways near this old whaling port city in
southeastern Massachusetts between July 1988 and April 1989. Two
other women are missing and presumed to be victims. All had
histories of drug abuse and some were prostitutes.
   Bristol County District Attorney Ronald Pina portrayed Ponte as
an unstable, cocaine-addicted man with violent tendencies. Pina
said Ponte used prostitutes or women with histories of drug
involvement to buy drugs, and Dopierla was preparing to expose him.
   ``The victim was going to come forward and be a witness against
attorney Ponte,'' Pina told Superior Court Judge George Hurd during
the arraignment and bail hearing. ``He began a pursuit of her. The
record will show he tried to prevent her from testifying. He
threatened to kill her.''
   Pina was careful not to link Ponte to the other killings. But
Ponte's lawyer said his client has been smeared in a
guilt-by-association prosecution.
   ``This man has been under more intense pressure for the past six
months than anyone I can imagine,'' Reddington said. ``His law
practice, as you can well imagine, your honor, has been ruined.''
   At arraignment, Ponte pleaded ``absolutely not guilty,'' in a
loud, clear voice. Hurd set a $50,000 cash bail, and Ponte was
released after his mother posted her house as security for bond.
   After the hearing, Ponte said his indictment was ``simply
political showmanship on the part of Ron Pina.''
   Pina, seeking re-election to a fourth term, faces a Sept. 18
Democratic primary challenge by lawyer Paul F. Walsh Jr., who has
accused Pina of political motivation in his handling of the case.
   Pina denied any political motive in the timing of the
indictments, saying of the grand jurors, ``They don't work for
me.'' The 21-member panel began meeting in March 1989.
   It was Pina who in 1984 prosecuted the widely publicized Big
Dan's tavern gang rape trial. Four were convicted; two were
acquitted of charges they cheered during the attack.

<HEAD>Iraqi Paper Warns of Harsh Winter for West</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iraqi newspaper warned today of a
harsh winter for western nations and suggested the United States
might face economic collapse because of its involvement in the
Persian Gulf.
   The Baghdad-based Al-Iraq said fuel shortages would result from
a U.N. embargo and the U.S.-led naval blockade against Iraq
following its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. The paper was quoted by
the official Iraqi News Agency.
   ``The daily said George Bush's crime against the Iraqi people
led to cutting down the virtual supply of oil and the rise of its
prices, the matter which predicts that the United States and the
West would see besides the harsh winter, severe reductions and a
fierce shock in the trade balance that might lead the American
economy to total collapse,'' said the agency, monitored in Nicosia.
   It said the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia had already
cost the United States $1.2 billion. It predicted the total by the
end of the year would be $200 billion, and warned ``the American
people that they would face acute economic and financial hardhips
as a result of their president's rash adventure,'' INA said.
   In another editorial, the government newspaper Al-Thawra said
the Iraqi decision to ban foreigners from traveling ``aims in its
essence to avert big harm by the lesser harm,'' INA said.
   It said Al-Thawra praised the decision as one expressing the
``will of the Iraqi people and their natural and legitimate right
for self-defense...''
   Officials in Baghdad say they are moving citizens of
``aggressive countries'' to areas at risk of attack by U.S.-led
military forces sent to Saudi Arabia to defend that oil-rich
kingdom from Iraq.

<HEAD>Pakistan To Extradite Soviet Hijackers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Eleven prisoners from a Siberian labor camp who
hijacked a jetliner to Pakistan will be extradited to the Soviet
Union, Tass reported today.
   Soviet law officers will travel to Karachi to escort the
prisoners home, the official news agency said, quoting Gulyam
Aliyev, deputy KGB chairman in the Uzbekistan republic. Aliyev did
not say when the extradition would occur.
   The Aeroflot Tupolev 154 jetliner, with 29 passengers and nine
crew members, returned to the Uzbekistan capital of Tashkent on
Monday night, Tass said.
   The prisoners, armed with guns and homemade explosives,
overpowered their guards in midair on Sunday and hijacked the plane
to Pakistan. The plane landed at Karachi International Airport on
Monday with less than 15 minutes of fuel remaining.
   Airport officials said the hijackers surrendered about two hours
after landing and sought political asylum.
   There have been at least 13 hijackings or attempted hijackings
of Soviet aircraft since late May _ mostly by Soviet teen-agers or
young men who said they wanted to live in Western countries.
   The latest incident began Sunday, when 15 prisoners were being
transported from Neryungry, 3,100 miles east of Moscow, to the
nearby city of Yakutsk in eastern Siberia.
   They forced the plane to return to Neryungry, where their labor
camp was located, officials said. Six prisoners and 41 women and
children passengers left the plane there, but two more convicts
joined the hijackers, said Soviet Interior Ministry spokesman Yuri
I. Arshenevsky.
   The plane then flew west to Krasnoyarsk in Siberia, where
authorities negotiated with the hijackers for two hours and allowed
the plane to refuel. The next stop was Tashkent, where a new crew
came on board and the hijackers demanded to leave the country.
   Officials negotiated with them overnight before allowing the
plane to take off for Pakistan. The independent news agency
Interfax said the hijackers promised to free the hostages on
arrival.
   Kadyr Atabayev, inspector of Uzbekistan's Civil Aviation
Department, told Tass the convicts ``thoroughly searched the new
crew before they could enter the plane.''
   ``The criminals were nervous, fearing possible tricks'' from the
authorities, Atabayev said.
   Tass quoted Deputy Interior Minister Ivan Shilov as saying there
would be an investigation into how the convicts managed to
commandeer the plane. The news agency said one of the prisoners
apparently smuggled weapons onto the plane in an artificial limb.

   Forty-nine men jumped from a
drifting, waterlogged oil rig into the stormy North Sea at dawn
today and were rescued by Danish ships, navy and oil company
spokesmen said.
   The men wore survival suits when they plunged in 46 mph winds
into waves of 26 to 33 feet. Lifeboats transferred them to two
vessels bound for the western Danish port of Esbjerg.
   The Danish navy said no one was injured among the 46 Norwegians,
one Briton and two Dutch citizens.
   Rescuers said the rig had begun to take on water and was in
danger of capsizing.
   The Norwegian rig, named West Gamma and chartered by Phillips,
served as a floating hotel for oil workers at North Sea stations.
It was being towed between stations Monday when the towline broke
in a storm.
   Danish navy spokesman Sven Voxtorp said the rig ran aground
early today in about 100 feet of water 54 miles west of the West
German island of Sylt.

   Whether Robert Mapplethorpe's sexual photos
should be considered on their own or in the context of his other
works was the question at a hearing on obscenity charges against a
museum and its director.
   Municipal Judge David J. Albanese considered arguments Monday on
a prosecution request to limit the case to five pictures identified
in the indictment against the Contemporary Arts Center and its
director, Dennis Barrie.
   Defense lawyers earlier had asked Albanese to dismiss the
misdemeanor charges of pandering obscenity, contending that the
175-picture exhibit seen as a whole could not be considered obscene.
   Albanese ended the hearing Monday without issuing a ruling on
either request.
   The photographs in question Monday depict homosexual sex acts.
One shows a man urinating into another man's mouth; others picture
objects inserted into men's anuses. But other photos in the exhibit
are close-ups of flowers.
   ``They are difficult images, but they are important to
understanding the artist's approach,'' said Martin Friedman,
director of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis.
   Friedman testified for the defense that each picture in the
exhibit had to be considered as part of the entire show. He said
the Cincinnati gallery's contract required it to show all the
pictures.
   ``The whole purpose of an exhibition is to set up context,''
Friedman said. ``You can't isolate some of the pictures and talk
about the exhibition.''
   The judge asked a defense witnesses whether sexually explicit
pictures were required as part of a survey of the late
Mapplethorpe's life.
   ``Is there some danger'' if the gallery ``was just a vehicle for
exhibiting erotic photographs for people who wanted to see erotic
photographs?'' Albanese asked Evan Turner, director of the
Cleveland Museum of Art.
   ``I don't think any of the photographs in this exhibition fits
that definition,'' Turner replied.
   Judith Reisman, a communications consultant who said she has
studied sexually explicit photographs for the Justice Department,
testified that photographs viewed individually would have affected
visitors.
   ``But I go in to see the exhibit as a whole, don't I?'' asked
defense lawyer H. Louis Sirkin.
   ``Absolutely not, absolutely not,'' Ms. Reisman said. ``There
are people who walked in and saw one picture and left.''
   The judge earlier ordered Barrie and the gallery to stand trial
Sept. 24 on one count involving pictures that show nude children.
   The charge of using children in material involving nudity and
the other of pandering to obscenity each would carry a maximum
penalty of six months in jail and a $1,000 fine for Barrie. The
gallery could be fined $5,000 on each charge.
   Albanese has not determined if the obscenity pandering count
will be tried, or whether the five photos can be judged separately
from the rest in the show.
   The Mapplethorpe exhibit closed in Cincinnati on May 26. It then
moved to Boston, where it opened Aug 2. at the Institute for
Contemporary Art.

<HEAD>Cruise Ship's Lifeboat Dumps Crew Members Into Skagway Harbor; Two
Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SKAGWAY, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A winch holding a cruise ship lifeboat
broke during a safety drill, dumping several crew members into the
frigid waters of Skagway Harbor and drowning two of them, police
said.
   Twelve people were pulled from the water after Monday's
accident, and rescuers tried unsuccessfully for more than an hour
to revive the two victims on the dock, said Chris Kirk, a reporter
for public radio station KHNS who was at the scene.
   Police officer Eric Sauer said identities of the dead and the
survivors were unavailable. Officials had not confirmed how many
people were in the lifeboat when it fell, and it was uncertain
whether more bodies might still be in the water, he said.
   The accident occurred Monday afternoon as the cruise ship Regent
Sun was docked at Skagway, Fire Chief Carl Mulvihill said. No
passengers were in the lifeboat.
   Several of the survivors were treated at the Skagway clinic, and
two were flown to Bartlett Memorial Hospital in Juneau. Nursing
supervisor Nina Rajala identified the two as Jorge Henriquez, 38,
and Juan Matute, 23. Their hometowns were unavailable.
   Henriquez was treated and released, and Matute was held Monday
night for observation, Rajala said.
   The Coast Guard and Skagway police were investigating the
accident.
   The two victims apparently were trapped under the boat when it
fell on top of them, said Jeff Brady, publisher of the Skagway
News. All the crew members were wearing life jackets, Brady said.
   When the winch broke the lifeboat flipped and fell into the
water, Brady said. ``One man told me he just saw bodies flying out
of the thing,'' he said.
   A similar accident occurred last summer in Juneau when eight
crew members of the cruise ship Daphne fell into Gastineau Channel
during a drill. None was seriously injured.

   A prosecutor says she will ask for ``as
much prison time as possible'' for a 23-year-old man convicted of
leaving a jogger staked to the ground to die after raping and
assaulting her.
   ``This is one of the most heinous crimes ever committed in this
county,'' Onondaga County Assistant District Attorney Mary Felasco
said Monday after jurors found Erwin Williams guilty.
   Williams, of Syracuse, was convicted of second-degree attempted
murder, rape, sexual abuse, unlawful imprisonment, assault and
weapons possession.
   Felasco said she would seek consecutive sentences on the rape
and attempted murder charges when Williams is sentenced by state
Supreme Court Justice Walter Gorman on Sept. 5.
   ``The evidence showed Williams attempted to murder her after he
raped her because she could identify him to police. To me, those
are two separate crimes,'' she said.
   Both charges carry sentences of 8 and one-third to 25 years.
   Defense attorney William Rose argued before the jury Monday that
discrepancies in testimony raised a reasonable doubt about his
client's guilt. The jury took just 2{ hours deliberating.
   Rose said Williams' admission to authorities was the most
damaging piece of evidence, even though he later refused to sign
the statement.
   Defendants' admissions similarly helped bring a conviction two
days earlier in a 1989 rape and assault of a jogger in Manhattan's
Central Park. That case attracted national publicity attributed by
many to the victim's status as an investment banker who fell prey
to youths engaged in a rampage they called ``wilding'' in Central
Park.
   The 43-year-old suburban Syracuse woman was attacked by two men
four years ago in Onondaga Lake Park. She was beaten, choked and
stabbed 11 times, and then shoelaces were used to tie her hands to
sticks that were thrust into the ground.
   But she managed to pull free and walk more than two miles with a
knife protruding from her neck for help. She recovered from her
injuries and testified in a closed session of the trial.
   Also testifying against Williams were his ex-wife, Gwendolyn
Williams, and co-defendant Ronald Jock, 32, of Brasher. Rose
pointed out that Jock testified as part of a deal in which he
pleaded guilty to attempted murder last month in exchange for
prosecutors' agreeing to recommend a 7- to 14-year sentence.
   The defense attorney noted that Ms. Williams came forward
earlier this year only after authorities ``very conveniently'' set
aside charges of child endangerment against her.
   ``It's kind of incredible that she waited four years to tell her
story to police,'' he added.

   Young Saudis massed in front of
military centers throughout the nation today in response to King
Fahd's call for them to volunteer to protect the country, residents
and officials said.
   Residents in the capital city of Riyadh said they could see
large groups of volunteers at the various military posts around the
sprawling city.
   The numbers were estimated to be in the thousands.
   On Monday, the king ordered the opening of recruitment and
training centers to strengthen the armed forces against the threat
posed by Iraqi troops massed in Kuwait near the Saudi border.
   ``There has been a very positive and gratifying response to King
Fahd's call,'' said Lt. Col. Ibrahim Y. Baqi, the commander of
civil defense in Jiddah.
   He said that in his area alone, thousands of Saudis had rushed
to sign up even before the king's appeal.
   Saudi Arabia does not have a draft, but the issue has been under
consideration by the Council of Ministers for years.
   ``I admire the good response and high spirit of Saudi citizens
who have shown heartening readiness to join the armed forces in
order to defend their homeland and the holy places,'' King Fahd
told the council.
   Preachers at mosques all over the country also have asked Saudis
to volunteer for military duty, telling them in sermons to ``be
ready for a period of Jihad (holy war).''
   The call for Saudi volunteers comes as tens of thousands of
foreign troops are arriving in Saudi Arabia as part of a U.S.-led
buildup of a multinational force to defend the kingdom against Iraq.
   Iraq, which invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and declared it had annexed
it four days later, has massed troops along the Saudi border.
   Before the king's order, Saudi volunteers had to go to military
camps or civil defense departments to enlist. Now, the Council
said, all concerned government departments have been ordered to
take steps to set up training centers to register volunteers for
the various sectors of the armed forces.
   ``We will not be surprised like the Kuwaitis,'' Interior
Minister Prince Naif was quoted as saying during a recent meeting
in Jiddah with some Saudi officials, journalists and intellectuals.
   Baqi said civil defense volunteers will undergo crash courses in
first aid, ambulance duties, firefighting and rescue operations.
   King Fahd also used Monday night's regular council session to
allay fears of any shortages in foodstuffs, money liquidity or any
other commodities.
   ``The government has taken all steps to maintain the stability
of the market,'' he said.

<HEAD>African Soldiers Board Warships, Preparing to Sail to Liberia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West African task force to halt
the fighting in Liberia boarded warships today, and diplomats said
the hundreds of soldiers were ready to sail for the besieged
capital of Monrovia.
   Soldiers, tanks and other weapons boarded the ships after rebel
leader Charles Taylor refused to go to a meeting he had earlier
agreed to attend to discuss a cease-fire with Gambian leader Sir
Dawda Jawara. Jawara is current chairman of the Economic Community
of West African States.
   The six-nation army was expected to leave Wednesday or Thursday
from Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone which neighbors Liberia,
according to African and Western diplomats.
   Taylor has threatened to attack any foreign troops that
intervene in Liberia's bloody 8-month-old war. African leaders have
ordered their soldiers to fight, if necessary, to force a truce in
the three-sided conflict.
   On Monday, President Samuel Doe's soldiers and a rival rebel
faction under Prince Johnson, which controls most of Monrovia,
announced a truce.
   Johnson has pledged to hold Monrovia's port for the arrival of
the African force, which Doe also has welcomed.
   Soldiers loyal to the two men told a diplomat who ventured into
the streets of Monrovia on Monday that they were prepared to join
forces to resist any attack by Taylor's men.
   They said they welcomed the West African intervention and would
not fire on the task force.
   Taylor has the largest army in the country, around 10,000 men,
but most are ill-trained peasant recruits and young boys. For
weeks, Doe's soldiers have kept them at bay 4 miles east of the
clifftop presidential mansion.
   Johnson's and Doe's men have fended off several attacks from
Taylor, who last week launched a last-ditch bid to oust Doe and
capture the port before the West Africans arrive.
   The war began with a Dec. 24 invasion from the northeastern
border with Ivory Coast by 200 rebels, who accused Doe of
corruption and tribalism.
   Thousands of civilians joined their ranks, seeking vengeance
against government soldiers who were unable to hold back the rebels
and instead killed thousands of peasants. Johnson split with Taylor
in February to form a rival faction.
   Monrovia has been besieged by the three armies since the end of
June, when water supplies, electricity and telephone communications
were cut.
   Those who have not fled or been evacuated have been without
fresh food supplies for weeks in the city, where bodies rot in the
streets and no hospitals are operating.

   A powerful typhoon combined with the summer holiday
rush to create the longest traffic jam in Japan's history _ an
84-mile-long highway mess, the Japan Highway Corp. said Tuesday.
   ``It is the longest traffic jam on record, and it was basically
caused by bad luck,'' corporation spokesman Katsutoshi Furuya said.
``Many drivers were on the road that day because the typhoon had
kept them off it the day before,'' he said. ``Everything just seems
to have come together in the worst way.''
   About 15,000 vehicles were involved in the traffic jam, which
occurred Aug. 12, he said. Japanese generally take holidays from
Aug. 10-19, to mark ``O-bon,'' or the Festival of the Dead. It is a
time when families gather to pay respects to their ancestors.
   Typhoon Winona had caused highway officials to close several
sections of roads across the country just as the holiday season was
beginning.
   The record-setting traffic snarl occurred on a highway between
Hyogo and Shiga prefectures in western Japan.

   A man believed to be a Basque
separatist was killed Tuesday when a bomb he was going to plant
outside a supermarket blew up, a government spokesman said.
   The blast took place just outside the Mamut supermarket in the
San Sebastian suburb of Oyarzun, said the provincical official, who
was not identified.
   He said the dead man, 23-year-old Jose Maria Aranzeistrouqui of
the nearby town of Usurbil, triggered the explosion while handling
the bomb he had placed under a seat of his car. Police believe he
was attempting to take the bomb out of the car and place it near
the supermarket.
   The supermarket has been the target of previous attacks by ETA,
a Basque separatist organization.
   ETA seeks independence from Spain for the three-province
northern Basque region. Since taking up arms in 1968, ETA has
claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people, mainly
police, military and Civil Guard officers.
   ETA is an acronym standing for homeland and liberty in the
Basque language. So far this year, the group has claimed
responsibility for the deaths of 13 people.

   Iraq said today it is willing to negotiate a settlement to the
Persian Gulf crisis but did not offer to withdraw its troops from
Kuwait and said that if a war breaks out, ``America will lose and
be humiliated.''
   ``We are ready to talk,'' Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz,
said at a news conference in Jordan. ``My president made proposals
that we are ready to put all the cards on the table'' at a U.N.
Security Council meeting.
   However, Aziz said all regional issues, including Israel's
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, must be settled
according to the same principles.
   When a reporter asked Aziz if Iraq was prepared to discuss
withdrawing from Kuwait, which Baghdad invaded on Aug. 2, he did
not directly reply, saying only that all issues in the Persian Gulf
must be discussed.
   In a statement on Iraqi television directed to President Bush,
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said today that foreign detainees
are being treated well and are only being held to prevent an attack
by U.S.-led forces.
   The detention of the foreigners is a ``product of aggression
against the Arab nation and Iraq,'' Saddam said. ``President Bush
is the one carrying out that aggression along with his allies.''
   Iraq has begun rounding up the thousands of foreigners in Iraq
and Kuwait and placing them around military installations. Saddam
insisted that ``what happened to the Americans so far is the
lightest possible treatment that is dictated by necessity, even by
American standards'' of human rights.
   He said the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia violates
holy Moslem sites there, and that if a war occurs: ``You are going
to lose and you will be defeated and we will be the victors with
the help of God.''
   Saddam's statement was read on television by an unidentified
announcer and was translated by Cable News Network.
   Aziz said he had carried a message from Saddam to Jordanian
officials, but he declined to provide details. Iraq has been
pressuring Jordan to continue to allow Iraqi goods to pass through
Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba. The port has been a key loophole
for Iraq in its effort to break the embargo.
   Aziz denied that the foreigners were hostages, calling them
``guests,'' and warned against any attack on Iraq or Kuwait.
   ``The Americans have prepared the ground for a war of
aggression. If the Americans think this is a vacation like they had
in Panama and Grenada, this will be a bloody conflict and America
will lose and be humilitaed.''
   Earlier today, Egypt urged Saddam to withdraw Iraqi troops from
Kuwait or face a war ``that will devour everything,'' and Britain
said the West must strangle Iraq economically despite its threats
against foreign hostages.
   President Bush planned to order thousands of military reservists
into active duty as early as today to bolster U.S. forces depleted
by the massive deployment of troops to protect Saudi Arabia from a
possible Iraqi attack.
   In another sign of growing Arab support for the U.S.-led
multinational force in Saudi Arabia, Syria confirmed today that it
was contributing troops.
   ``Syria began today sending its military forces to participate
in the defense of Saudi Arabia,'' an official source said on
condition of anonymity.
   In the Persian Gulf, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney met with
Saudi officials to share military intelligence and to discuss the
possible sale of additional F-15 fighters and heavy tanks to
bolster the kingdom's defenses.
   The international economic embargo against Iraq got a boost from
Yemen today when that country assured the U.N. Security Council it
would turn away an Iraqi oil tanker that had ignored warning shots
fired by U.S. warships.
   But two Iraqi oil tankers that had been turned away from Saudi
Arabia last week were seen docked in Yemen's port of Aden today,
raising new questions about Yemen's commitment to the embargo.
   A port official said the Al-Fao and the Al-Qadissiyah tankers
were docked when he arrived at work today. Diplomatic sources, who
also spoke on condition of anonymity, said the tankers may have
arrived before today's U.N. session.
   The Security Council deferred action on a proposal that
multinational forces be allowed to use force to back up U.N.
sanctions. Bush has already authorized U.S. ships to use minimum
force to interdict Iraqi vessels.
   At the first major European gathering to deal with the Persian
Gulf crisis, the nine-nation Western European Union decided today
to send forces to the gulf, and urged the Security Council to take
measures to enforce the embargo.
   The union effectively gave the go-ahead to three nations _
Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy _ to commit naval forces to the
tense region. A Spanish official at the meeting said his nation
will send four ships to the gulf.
   Iraq, meanwhile, has moved 800 ballistic missiles into Kuwait in
addition to the tens of thousands of troops and hundreds of tanks
massed on the Saudi border, the editor of Jane's Soviet
Intelligence Review said in London today.
   The editor, Henry Dodds, said some of the missiles have a range
of 400 miles, or far enough to hit U.S. troops and major Saudi
cities.
   With the United States building up its armed forces in Saudi
Arabia and blocking Iraqi ports with an armada of ships, Iraq has
moved to use Westerners stranded inside Kuwait and Iraq as human
shields.
   For the first time, Bush on Monday publicly referred to the
21,000 Westerners, including 3,000 Americans and 4,500 Britons, as
hostages and demanded their release.
   Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, who has rallied Arab opposition to the
invasion, today urged Saddam, Iraq's president, to withdraw his
forces from Kuwait.
   In a statement read on state-owned TV and radio, Mubarak said he
was making his appeal ``in the name of everything sacred on our
Arab soil ... in the name of Islam, the religion of peace ... in
the name of Arab nationalism ... in the name of every man, woman
and child on our Arab land.''
   ``In the name of light, good and right, I appeal to President
Saddam Hussein to save both man and entity in our Arab world from a
destructive war that will devour everything,'' Mubarak said. ``God
only knows what the terrifying outcome will be if war begins, or
how much damage there will be if the fire erupts, taking us
backward into total darkness and loss.''
   In London, Mrs. Thatcher said today that she will not negotiate
to secure the release of the British citizens detained by Iraq.
   ``As President Bush pointed out yesterday, Saddam Hussein is
trying in his tactics to hide behind Western women and children and
use them as human shields and use them as part of his
negotiations,'' she said at a news conference.
   She called for another U.N. resolution to authorize the use of
military force to make the international embargo against Iraq work.

<HEAD>City Pet Store Features Exotic Animals For Display</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COLLEEN DISKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leopards and llamas and doves. Oh my.
   Those are among the exotic denizens of Animal Kingdom, a pet
store that serves as a zoo for urban children and home for show
business animals.
   In addition to the usual assortment of puppies, kittens,
reptiles and fish, the store has a leopard that stars in
commercials, a duck that used to appear on a children's program and
an organ grinder's monkey that shares his cage with a toy fox
terrier.
   ``We have one rule about our exotic animals _ they have to be
able to work,'' said general manager Steve Maciontek. ``That way
they aren't just sitting in their cages all the time. That's not
good for them.''
   So Joshua the llama pulls a cart at parades, Luther the leopard
appears in commercials, and the 30-odd doves in the store are
rented out for weddings, serving as centerpieces at the bride and
groom's table.
   Maciontek said the 10,000 square-foot store has a special
exhibitor's license that allows it to house and display the 35
exotic animals it rents out, but never sells.
   When they're not earning their keep, the store's animals serve
as entertainment for customers and school children who visit the
store for free tours.
   ``When I get an inner city kid that's never been to a zoo, and I
see his eyes light when he sees the leopard, it makes it all
worthwhile,'' Maciontek said.
   The store on the city's north side averages at least two tours a
day during summer. Maciontek said the purpose is not only to expose
children to animals, but to teach them about caring for pets and
exotic animals.
   Twice a month, employees take animals to hospitals and nursing
homes, offering ``pet therapy'' to patients, Maciontek said.
   ``What we're trying to get across with our store is that animals
are only as wild as we make them,'' he said. ``People are shocked
when we go right into the cages to clean the animals, and the
leopard or the tiger licks our hands.''
   Only one of the store's animals is endangered, a rhinoceros
hornbill named Harriet. The 10-pound black-and-orange horned bird
is similar to a toucan.
   Federal officials inspect the store every year, checking to see
that the animal cages are large enough and that they're being fed
the right diet.
   Maciontek said the store occasionally gets complaints from
animal rights activists who don't think traditionally wild animals
should be in captivity. But he contends that the animals are
well-cared for and fare better than they might if they were in the
jungle.

   Syria, Iraq's main Arab foe, said today it
was sending troops to Saudi Arabia to help defend the kingdom
against a possible Iraqi attack.
   ``Syria began today sending its military forces to participate
in the defense of Saudi Arabia should the kingdom be exposed to an
external aggression,'' a government statement said.
   Saudi official sources sid last week that more than 1,000 Syrian
soldiers already had already arrived in the kingdom.
   Damascus would not comment on the earlier report.
   Today's government statement was carried by state radio and the
official news agency. It did not say how many soldiers would be
sent to the kingdom.
   It said Syria was ``complying to the Arab decision taken at the
last summit conference in Cairo which provides for fulfilling Saudi
Arabia's request for assistance in defending itself.''
   At the summit in Cairo earlier this month, 12 of 21 Arab League
members resolved to send forces to Saudi Arabia and other Persian
Gulf countries requesting help in defending against a possible
Iraqi attack. The three other factors which prompted the decision,
the Syrian statement said, were Syria's ``readiness to defend
Islam's holy shrines; its belief that the Gulf region should not be
left to the foreigners and that Arab troops should replace these
foreign forces there; and its conviction that the move constitutes
a national duty that prevente division in Arab ranks.''
   Syria has been a chief critic of Western policy and especially
U.S. policy in the region.
   Its agreement to send troops may improve its relations with the
West, especially with Britain, which severed ties with Damascus in
1987 over alleged Syrian involvement in an abortive attempt to blow
up an Israeli jetliner at London's Heathrow Airport.
   Syria also is condemned by the U.S. State Department as one of
the countries that sponsor terrorism.

   There is plenty of consultation, but the
United States and other Western countries are stopping short of
all-out coordination of their responses to Iraqi initiatives in the
Persian Gulf, administration officials said Tuesday.
   ``It is not that we sit down and say, `Let's make sure that we
do exactly the same thing','' said one administration official, who
asked not to be identified.
   The same official said there have been instances where American
diplomats planning to meet with the Iraqis had been told by their
British and French counterparts, ``You can speak for us, too.''
   Another example was the administration's rejection Sunday of
Saddam Hussein's suggestion that he would free foreign nationals in
Iraq if President Bush withdrew U.S. forces from Saudi Arabia and a
worldwide trade embargo against Baghdad were lifted.
   ``I can't tell you specifically how we discussed that over the
weekend,'' State Department spokesman Richard L. Boucher said.
``But all throughout this crisis, we've been in very close touch
with other countries both at the United Nations, in capitals, and
in Washington.
   ``There are a variety of countries whose citizens are in similar
circumstances. And, of course, we have approached the Iraqis
jointly as well as consulted amongst ourselves.''
   The five permanent members of the United Nations Security
Council _ the United States, China, Britain, France and the Soviet
Union _ are discussing the possibility of a joint military
operation under U.N. auspices.
   When asked whether there were discussions about the Iraqi demand
that the embassies in Kuwait be closed, Boucher said, ``We have
discussed this clearly with other governments ... and of course we
work with other governments at the United Nations. But I'm not
going to speculate at this point on what will happen either by the
Iraqis or what our reaction might be.''
   Boucher also said that the Iraqi announcement had ``absolutely
no legal standing'' and that the United States would hold Iraq
accountable for its treatment of American diplomats. Britain and
other European countries also said they rejected the Iraqi demand.
   In Paris, where the nine-nation Western European Union decided
Tuesday to send forces to the Persian Gulf, the organization's
secretary general, Willem van Eekelen, said, ``We in Western Europe
see the need to act so that the United States is not left to have
to do the job alone.''

   Wholesale unleaded gasoline prices hit a new
high on the New York Mercantile Exchange for the fifth day in a row
today, crude oil prices were up and a nationwide survey showed
retail fuel prices rising quickly.
   ``The market's very concerned about possible military
escalation, which of course implies possible damage to the Saudi
oil supply,'' said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   In early trading this morning, the price of unleaded gasoline
shot up to $1.06 per gallon for September delivery, 4{ cents higher
than a record Monday at the Merc. The exchange is a crucial market
for petroleum and a pacesetter for retail prices.
   After peaking at $1.015, unleaded gasoline closed at $1.003 per
gallon Monday, 4.28 cents over Friday's late price, part of a
series of record unleaded gasoline futures prices that began last
Wednesday.
   The September contract price of benchmark light sweet crude oil
rose 14 cents per 42-gallon barrel to $28.70 by midmorning today
after dipping 7 cents on Monday. Contracts for later months all
rose, suggesting that traders believe a long siege in the Persian
Gulf will cause major supply problems.
   The market was responding partly to President Bush's declaration
on Monday that Americans held in Iraq and Kuwait are ``hostages''
and that the United States holds Iraq responsible, traders said.
   ``More players think the crisis is going to last longer,''
Hittle said.
   Anxiety over supplies also pushed up gasoline prices at the
pump. The American Automobile Association said its nationwide check
of unleaded self-serve regular averaged $1.237 a gallon Monday, up
2.1 cents from a week earlier. The average is 16.2 cents higher
since the crisis began with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2,
the AAA said.
   Home heating oil for September delivery closed Monday at 82.96
cents per gallon, up 2.42 cents from Friday's close. The price of
natural gas stayed sluggish Monday, falling from $1.440 to $1.417
per 1,000 cubic feet for September delivery.
   In early trading today, home heating oil was up 3.69 cents to
86.65 cents per gallon, while natural gas dropped to $1.415 per
1,000 cubic feet at today's opening.

   Actor Dennis Quaid, accused of making
false statements to obtain a Montana resident fishing license,
failed to appear in court.
   His lawyer, Joe Swindlehurst, said Quaid simply forgot to show
up Friday.
   Quaid, the star of such movies as ``Great Balls of Fire,'' ``The
Right Stuff'' and ``The Big Easy,'' keeps a home near here. He was
accused Aug. 13 of falsely stating that he is a Montana resident on
a license bought May 19.
   Swindlehurst said the charge amounted to a difference of opinion.
   ``Dennis has property here and calls this place home,'' he said.
``I'm sure he considers himself a resident.''
   Justice of the Peace Deanna Egeland said she did not sign an
arrest warrant for Quaid after he failed to show because
Swindlehurst posted $115 bond Monday. Swindlehurst also entered an
innocent plea on behalf of his client.
   The $115 bond is the amount of the fine for a first-offense
conviction, Egeland said.

<TEXT>
   The nine-nation Western European Union decided
today to step up and coordinate military operations in the Persian
Gulf and urged the U.N. Security Council to take added measures to
enforce sanctions against Iraq.
   The union, the only European forum dealing with security and
defense, effectively gave the go-ahead to three nations _ Belgium,
the Netherlands and Italy _ to commit naval forces to the tense
region.
   Foreign and defense ministers warned Iraq of ``serious
consequences'' should foreign nationals trapped in Iraq and Kuwait
be harmed.
   The meeting, the first major European gathering to deal with the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, was followed by a working lunch of the 12
European Community foreign ministers.
   The ministers rejected an Iraqi ultimatum to close foreign
embassies in Kuwait by Friday.
   Diplomats are to ``remain in place as representatives of our
governments,'' Italian Foreign Minister Gianni de Michelis
announced. He said, however, that diplomats are not to use force to
keep the missions open.
   Western Europe initially offered an array of cautious responses
to the Persian Gulf crisis, but Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
plan to turn foreign nationals into Iraqi hostages has drawn Europe
toward a tougher response.
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas opened the meeting by
calling the trapped Westerners hostages, saying their plight
``revolts us.''
   It was the first time France, which has the second largest
military force in the gulf after the United States, referred to the
Westerners as hostages. An estimated 560 French nationals are in
Iraq and Kuwait.
   The ministers stressed their wish for a solution with Arab
nations, ``the first concerned'' by the crisis.
   The military forces will remain under their respective national
commands. Coordination is to extend to zones of operation, task
sharing, logistical support and information exchanges, according to
a final communique. Armed forces chiefs are to meet Friday to work
out details.
   The union also wants to cooperate with the large U.S. forces in
the gulf, the communique said without elaboration.
   ``Automatically, there will be a need for coordination,''
Belgian Defense Minister Guy Coeme said after the meeting.
   Coeme said there was no explicit decision on the use of force by
European vessels to enforce the embargo.
   The Western European Union's members are France, Britain, West
Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain and
Portugal.
   France, Iraq's largest arms supplier in the West, has reacted
cautiously but made a military commitment.
   Paris sent eight warships and 3,800 men. But to placate the Arab
world, France also dispatched a fleet of diplomats to explain its
position and seek an Arab solution.
   On Sunday, Paris said it would respond with ``firmness'' to
possible violations of the U.N. embargo against Iraq. It did not
elaborate.
   Despite a strong start in sending naval and air force units to
help defend Saudi Arabia, Britain only belatedly joined the United
States in decreeing Saturday that shots could be fired to enforce
the embargo.

   CBS anchorman Dan Rather and eight CBS staffers,
the last U.S. network crew still in Iraq covering Persian Gulf
crisis developments there, were ordered out of Baghdad and left
today, CBS said.
   The CBS contingent, which includes correspondent Allen Pizzey,
now are in Amman, Jordan. They had been in Baghdad since last
Wednesday, arriving a day after an ABC crew led by ``Nightline''
anchorman Ted Koppel.
   Koppel left Baghdad on Thursday, followed several days later by
his ABC colleagues.
   Iraqi officials made no threats to Rather and his CBS crew in
ordering them out and just said that the journalists had
``outstayed their welcome,'' CBS spokeswoman Donna Dees said.
   ``We were told there was a plane out this morning, and we should
be on it,'' she said.
   Despite Iraq's action, officials at NBC News and Cable News
Network said they would continue trying to get their reporters into
Iraq.

   American troops stationed here before the
huge buildup of the past two weeks are complaining they have not
been issued suits designed to protect against chemical weapons.
   ``All these guys coming in here get gas masks and the suits but
we get nothing,'' one Air Force airman said. ``They are treating us
as if we don't count.''
   A military spokesman said the shortage was discussed at a
command staff briefing Tuesday and more suits are expected to
arrive on transport planes in the next few days.
   Even so, the enlisted men's comments suggest how deep the fear
of chemical weapons runs. Such weapons _ and Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's willingness to use them _ are prime topics of discussion
among troops here.
   ``It's as much psychological as anything,'' one of the men, an
Air Force master sergeant, said of the protective suits. ``We see
everybody else with them and hear everything being said about
Iraq's gas and chemicals but we get nothing.''
   One Air Force sergeant, stationed in Saudi Arabia the past nine
months, went as far as calling a news organization in the United
States to voice his complaint.
   ``I was just fed up with the bureaucracy,'' the sergeant said
Monday. ``Why should my guys be left naked?''
   Pentagon ground rules prohibit the use of troops' names in news
media pool dispatches from Saudi Arabia.
   In brief interviews with a dozen men stationed here as part of a
standing U.S. military training operation, just one said he had
chemical gear.
   ``I scrounged it up by cutting a deal,'' the Air Force sergeant
said.
   The sergeant who called the states to complain said there are
about 120 U.S. military personnel stationed at the training
mission, most of them Air Force. The men conduct training with the
Saudi military and also provide security, communications and other
logistical support to a small U.S. compound on a Saudi air base.
   ``I don't have a suit. I don't have a gas mask. I don't have any
of it,'' an Army sergeant said when asked whether he had the
protective gear.
   Both Saudi and American officials have said they doubted Iraq
has the capability to successfully use chemical weapons against the
base. Iraq's missiles are not considered very accurate at long
distances, and the United States has deployed missile-killing
Patriot missile systems at strategic areas as a precaution. Also,
Air Force officials have predicted U.S. or Saudi fighters could
intercept any Iraqi planes that tried to cross into Saudi territory.
   But the men said they still would feel more comfortable with the
anti-chemical gear and had requested it several times.
   One said he was told gear for the men stationed here full time
was aboard a C-130 transport plane that arrived at their air base
Monday. But when he went the plane, the man said he was told the
chemical suits and gear already had been taken somewhere.
   ``Somewhere, but not here, not for us,'' he said.

   The United States will upgrade the Saudi military
arsenal of U.S. F-15 fighter jets and heavy tanks, a senior
Pentagon official said Tuesday as Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
concluded a whirlwind Mideast trip.
   The official, who spoke on condition on anonymity, said no
specific agreements were reached during Cheney's visit with Saudi
King Fahd and Defense Minister Prince Sultan.
   But the Iraqi threat to the oil-rich desert kingdom, and the
need to upgrade the Saudi arsenal in the face of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's million-man army, means the Bush administration
will consider selling the Saudis high-powered F-15C and F-15D jet
fighters as well as heavy tanks, the official said.
   The official refused to confirm a report that the vastly more
sophisticated version of the fighter, the F-15E, was also on the
Saudi's ``wish list,'' but he also declined to rule out such a sale.
   Such weaponry would have to be bought from the Pentagon's
present stock to quickly bolster the Saudi arsenal.
   Cheney, heading back to Washington at the end of a four-day tour
of five Persian Gulf states, told reporters traveling with him that
the Bush administration also favors increasing aid to Egypt.
   Noting its ``very close relations'' with the United States,
Cheney commended Egypt's active role in the Middle East and said
``President Bush and our government feel very strongly'' about
increased military aid.
   Egypt receives about $1.3 billion a year in such aid.
   Cheney spoke after a 90-minute meeting with Youssef Sabry
Abu-Taleb, Egypt's defense minister. He said he and Abu-Taleb
``compared notes'' on the crisis created by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion
and subsequent annexation of Kuwait.
   ``We hope that diplomatic efforts through the United Nations and
economic sanctions will ultimately force Saddam to have to give
up,'' Cheney said.
   Earlier, Cheney told reporters ``the Saudis are facing a very
large tank army just across the border in Kuwait.''
   ``We have worked with the Saudis in the past ... and basically
what we're doing on a short-term basis is reinforcing their
capabilities in these areas,'' Cheney said.
   He refused to confirm the exact kind of tanks that are under
discussion, but noted that the Saudis have ``some substantial air
assets'' from the United States, such as the F-15Cs and the F-15Ds.
   The Saudis earlier agreed to buy $3 billion worth of the
Pentagon's most lethal tanks, the M1-A2, but they are not due for
delivery until the mid-1990s. In the interim, possible candidates
for purchase could be the M1-A1 version or the M-60 tank.
   The senior Pentagon official, speaking of the F-15s and heavy
tanks, said the United States ``will move quickly to consider such
requests.'' Bush already has waived a congressional limit to
provide 12 more F-15s to the Saudis during the crisis.
   Cheney termed his swing through the Persian Gulf a successful
one in that it had increased cooperation with Arab states with
which the United States had rather cool relations in the past.
   Cheney met with King Fahd in the Saudi capital of Jiddah before
flying to Cairo. Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams described the
meeting as ``a good, positive discussion.''
   Cheney arrived in Jiddah late Monday after a 15-hour swing
through five Persian Gulf nations to seek support for the U.S.-led
military operation against Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. He also met
with the princes and sheiks who rule Bahrain, the United Arab
Emirates, Oman and Qatar.
   On Monday, Sheik Zayed al Nahyan, president of the United Arab
Emirates, welcomed the presence in his nation of a squadron of
C-130 transport planes and its company of 575 American military
personnel.
   The gesture was an important show of cooperation from a gulf
nation that had never publicly acknowledged any major U.S. military
presence on its soil.

<TEXT>
   After following his father into cherry farming,
Ray Pleva figures tart cherries are in his blood. They're certainly
in his sausage.
   Pleva is negotiating to go nationwide with his award-winning
cherry-pecan pork sausage. Such success, he hopes, could rescue
Michigan's tart-cherry industry from doldrums caused by production
exceeding demand.
   Daughter Cindy, the 1987-88 National Cherry Queen, is credited
for inspiring the sausage, which prompts most people to make faces
_ until they try it.
   ``We'd be talking about (cherry industry) problems at the dinner
table, and she'd say, `Boy it would be nice if we could have
something new.' The idea just popped up,'' he recalled. ``I thought
about it 7,500 times.''
   Finally, he experimented. He hit on the recipe _ 20 percent tart
cherries, 4 percent pecans, the rest lean pork and spices _ in
February 1988. The former cherry farmer started selling it at
Pleva's Meats, a business he and wife Marge run in Cedar, in
Leelanau County northwest of Traverse City. He says he is patenting
the mixture, which has only a subtle cherry-nut flavor.
   In 1989, the product received the Michigan New Product Award,
was featured on Cable News Network and was honored at the National
Restaurant Show in Chicago. He said he has shipped the product to
49 states and is talking with national fast-food chains.
   ``We think we'll have good news for cherry farmers soon,'' he
said, referring to Michigan's 1,100 growers, who produce about
three-quarters of the nation's tart-cherry crop.
   Production of about 275 million pounds of tart cherries in 1987
exceeded national demand by about 55 million pounds, haunting
growers for the next two seasons, said Dick Johnston of the Cherry
Marketing Institute in Okemos.
   This season, supply and demand are expected to even out, he
said. But products like Pleva's could boost tart cherries' share of
the competitive fruit market, he said.
   Pleva is expanding his cherry-pecan line, making a spicier
Italian cherry sausage, cherry pepperoni and cherry sausage snack
sticks. He says his links are sources of vitamins A and C, because
of the cherry content, and of fiber, because of the nuts.
   A Grand Rapids laboratory analysis showed his sausage links have
77 calories per ounce, nearly 60 of them from fat. A conventional
breakfast sausage has 119 calories per ounce, nearly 95 from fat,
said Allison Boomer of the American Dietetic Association.
   Though Pleva's sausage has lower calories and fat, she said:
``It wouldn't be something I'd eat often. To me, (sausage) is like
eating butter.''

   A couple accused of torturing and
sexually abusing five of their seven children were sentenced to
life in prison.
   Emmet County Circuit Judge Richard Pajtas on Monday sentenced
Gerald and Pamela Platz on a total of eight abuse and rape charges.
Twelve other counts were dropped when the couple pleaded no contest
in July.
   The Platzes were ordered to serve 16 to 24 months for child
abuse, 10 to 15 years for second-degree criminal sexual conduct and
life for first-degree criminal sexual conduct. The Platzes will be
eligible for parole after 10 years.
   The former Mackinaw City couple were accused of repeatedly
raping their five oldest children _ the oldest was 7. Gerald Platz
allegedly cut the youngsters' arms with broken glass and stapled
their skin and defecated on their faces, prosecutors said.
   Authorities said the abuse occurred between 1986 and 1988.
   All seven of the children, including one born after Mrs. Platz
was jailed, have been put in adoptive homes.
   George Spanos, the defense lawyer for Mrs. Platz, does not have
his client's permission to talk to reporters, his secretary said.
There was no answer Monday at the phone for Dianne Hoffman, the
lawyer for Platz.
   The Platzes told court officials they were themselves victims of
abuse in families with alcoholism problems. But Pajtas was not
swayed in his sentencing.
   ``Gerald Platz has subjected his family to a life of isolation,
incest and horrible acts of sexual abuse that can only be described
as barbaric, shocking and disgusting,'' the judge said.
   Prosecutor Diane Smith said the Platzes have ``damaged these
children for life.''
   ``These parents robbed their children of their innocence.
Instead of watching videos of Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, they were
subjected to `Debby Does Dallas.'''
   Traverse City police arrested the Platzes in September 1989.

<HEAD>Armenia Considers Declaration of Independence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Armenia's parliament debated a declaration of
independence on Tuesday and considered setting up its own army for
protection from neighboring Azerbaijan, Soviet media reported.
   Azerbaijan's president responded by calling for sanctions
against Armenia and warning that his republic might be forced to
take steps to guarantee its security, the Soviet news agency Tass
said.
   Armenia, a predominantly Christian republic, and Azerbaijan,
which is primarily Moslem, have been engaged in bloody conflict for
more than two years over Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave in Azerbaijan
with a predominantly Armenian population.
   The spiral of ethnic violence, mixed with aspirations for
independence, has been a major problem for the Kremlin. President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev has repeatedly warned that such divisions
endanger his program of economic and political reforms.
   In the latest fighting, Armenian militants marching behind dump
trucks attacked and burned the Azerbaijani village of Baganis-Airum
on Monday after driving off Soviet troops, Tass reported. One
Soviet officer was killed, and four soldiers and four civilians
were wounded in the attack, Tass said.
   On Tuesday, the Armenian Supreme Soviet met in the republic's
capital of Yerevan, about 1,200 miles southeast of Moscow, to
consider a declaration proclaiming Armenia a ``sovereign,
independent and self-governed state,'' the independent news service
Interfax reported.
   One proposed chapter of the declaration calls for establishment
of Armenia's own armed forces, interior troops and public security
units, Interfax said.
   The proposed declaration would bar ``any foreign country'' from
deploying military units on Armenian territory without permission,
Interfax said. This would presumably include the Soviet Union.
   Soviet Interior Ministry troops are stationed in Armenia and
Azerbaijan to try to keep the peace. They have come under fire from
both sides.
   The Soviet officer who was killed Monday, Lt. Alexander Lipatov,
had been promoted to deputy chief of staff of his battalion after
the previous holder of that post, Capt. Sergei Osetrov, was killed
in action.
   ``Ironically,'' Tass said, ``Osetrov fell protecting an Armenian
village from Azerbaijani extremists, while Lipatov was killed by
Armenian terrorists attacking an Azerbaijani village.''
   Tass quoted Major Gen. Anatoly Kirilyuk as saying the militants
who attacked Baganis-Airum were armed with field artillery,
mortars, grenade launchers, submachine guns and sniper rifles.
   ``The gunmen burned down or ravaged every house in the village,
but its population had managed to escape in advance,'' Kirilyuk was
quoted as saying. The news agency did not say how many people lived
in the village.
   In another clash Monday, Azerbaijani militants fired on two
villages in Armenia's Noemberyan region, killing three people and
wounding six, Tass said. No details were provided.
   In a speech broadcast over Azerbaijani radio and television on
Tuesday, Azerbaijani President Ayaz Mutalibov accused Gorbachev of
foot-dragging on a decree to disband militant groups and confiscate
their weapons.
   Gorbachev issued the decree in July, giving militant groups
until Aug. 9 to comply with the order to turn in their weapons and
disband. Tass reported Aug. 11 that the deadline had been extended
two months.
   ``The entire course of events demands that real political, legal
and other sanctions be finally adopted against the Armenian
republic within the powers entrusted to the Soviet president and
government, as is the case when the Soviet Constitution is
violated,'' Mutalibov said.
   He appeared to be calling for sanctions similar to the economic
embargo imposed by the Kremlin on Lithuania after the Baltic
republic declared itself independent in March.

   A pet cat named Boogs who faced execution
as a dangerous animal has won a court reprieve after his plight
became the subject of a letter-writing campaign.
   A state judge lifted the death sentence Monday but ordered
Boogs' owner to keep the cat on a leash and muzzled or in a cage
when outside his home, and to keep the cat's rabies shots up to
date.
   About a dozen of Boogs' supporters applauded after Dane County
Circuit Judge Susan Steingass announced her decision.
   ``I'm bitter, but my bitterness is outweighed by the joy of
getting Boogs back,'' said Boogs' owner, D.W. Wanberg, a
34-year-old theater lighting designer.
   The 6-year-old grey and white cat had been on death row at the
Dane County Animal Shelter for 15 months. City Health Department
officials had ordered the cat put to death for growling at
neighbors, eating a neighbor cat's food and nipping an animal
control officer who picked him up.
   Officials also said the cat had menaced and bitten other people.
   Wanberg said workers at the shelter had denied him the right to
visit Boogs. He argued that the city's actions were too extreme.
   ``Pit bulls can be a danger to life, but not my cat,'' he said.
   There was no word on Boogs' reaction to being released; Wanberg
did not answer his telephone Tuesday.
   Mrs. Steingass said the stipulations regarding the caging or
leashing and muzzling of Boogs were necessary because of ``concerns
about the way Boogs has interacted in society.''
   The settlement capped a letter-writing campaign to the judge by
Boogs' backers, including inmates at the Waupun Correctional
Institution and a woman in Puerto Rico.
   ``We are willing to take Boogs in and make a home for him _ that
is if Warden Gary McCaughtry approves,'' said a letter signed by
eight inmates at the prison in northeastern Wisconsin.
   Elba Nieves, who heard of Boogs' situation through news reports,
wrote from Puerto Rico that she did not consider Boogs to be a
``menacing cat.''
   People suffering from hunger ``sometimes steal to eat,'' she
said. ``I'm not justifying this, but give Boogs a chance.''
   The city's lawyer, Carolyn Hogg, argued officials were right to
confine Boogs because they have a duty to protect residents from
dangerous pets.
   But Boogs' lawyer, John Hansen, said the law does not allow city
officials to kill pets simply because the health director decides
an animal is dangerous.

<HEAD>Conservative Group Says Souter Should Not Be Treated as a

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter should
not be treated as a politician and asked about his personal views
on Supreme Court rulings, a conservative group that backs him said
Tuesday.
   ``We don't think it's proper that Judge Souter act like a
congressional candidate and say, `Read my lips. I'll do this,'''
said Tom Jipping of Coalitions for America.
   Jipping said the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is to begin
confirmation hearings for Souter on Sept. 13, ``should not demand
he bias himself in public'' on issues he would deal with as a high
court member.
   Jipping, author of an analysis of Souter's work as a longtime
member of the New Hampshire Supreme Court, said the committee
should conduct ``a properly focused investigation'' before
confirming his nomination.
   Liberal groups, especially those advocating abortion rights,
have been urging the Senate to grill Souter about his largely
unknown views on issues the court is deeply divided over _ such as
abortion, church-state relations and affirmative action.
   But Jipping urged the Senate not to repeat the ``shameless''
treatment in 1987 of failed Supreme Court nominee Robert H. Bork.
   ``In fulfilling its constitutional role of advice and consent,
the Senate in 1987 shifted radically from examining qualifications
to checking out a nominee's politics, from conducting a searching
inquiry into judicial philosophy to narrowly testing how a nominee
would vote once on the bench,'' Jipping said.
   ``This is not only a dangerous aberration from traditional
practice, it directly threatens the independence of the judiciary
and literally demands that a nominee bias himself in public on
issues that may well come before him as a judge,'' he added.

<TEXT>
   The leader of the second-largest party in the
East German Parliament said today he was resigning, and a plan to
merge the German states on Oct. 14 appeared in danger.
   Earlier today, Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere said the
leaders of all the major political parties had agreed that East
Germany would unite with West Germany on Oct. 14.
   Richard Schroeder, leader of the left-leaning Social Democrat
faction in Parliament, was among those who agreed to the proposal.
But members of his party later balked and said German unity should
take place on or before Sept. 15 because of the country's chaotic
economic situation.
   The Social Democrats, who withdrew from de Maiziere's broad
governing coalition on Sunday in a dispute over unification, met to
discuss what action to take.
   Before the meeting, Schroeder said he was resigning as chief of
his faction in Parliament.
   ``The opposition needs an opposition leader,'' he said,
indicating he was closer to agreement with de Maiziere than with
his fellow Social Democrats.
   The change was yet another example of the chaos in the young,
inexperienced democratic government as it tries to deal with
mounting joblessness and falling industrial production.
   Six ministers have resigned or been ousted from the Cabinet in
the past week, and the head of the agency set up to sell the
nation's ailing enterprises resigned amid criticism of his failure
to unload the businesses.
   After the Oct. 14 compromise was announced by de Maiziere at a
press conference, Social Democrat spokesman Juergen Itzfeldt said
the date for unity is too far away.
   Itzfeldt said it was possible the Social Democrats would try to
set an earlier date during the Parliament meeting on Wednesday.
However, they are not believed to have enough votes to challenge de
Maiziere's Christian Democrats.
   Parliament must approve unification by a two-thirds majority but
only a simple majority is needed to set a date. All the major
parties are committed to unification, but the debate has been
reduced to a political brawl over when it should take place.
   For weeks, the left-leaning Social Democrats and the
conservative Christian Democrats have argued over the date when
formal unification should take place.
   The dispute outraged many East Germans who are more concerned
about whether they will lose their jobs and homes, and be able to
pay steadily rising food prices caused by the switch to a free
market economy.
   De Maiziere called today's meeting of party leaders in the
latest attempt to settle the political brawl.

   The army on Tuesday dispatched tanks and
troop reinforcements to the frontier with Pakistan, where soldiers
from the two nations have been fighting recently, officials and
witnesses said.
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh told Parliament that Indian armed
forces were ``fully prepared to effectively deal with any
eventuality.''
   Indian and Pakistani troops clashed in a remote border area in
the disputed Kashmir region Monday. Singh, who is also defense
minister, said exchange of fire also occurred Tuesday.
   In Pakistan, a Defense Ministry spokesman, who cannot be
identified under briefing rules, said Tuesday that Indian and
Pakistani soldiers exchanged artillery fire in the Kel sector along
the cease-fire line dividing Kashmir into Pakistani and Indian
regions. He said there were no casualties among Pakistani soldiers.
   The Pakistani official also said that on Monday and Tuesday,
Indian soldiers fired on Pakistani civilians traveling on a
mountain road, injuring four people. He also said Indian soldiers
fired on an ambulance and a bus.
   There was no report from India on the alleged firing.
   Despite the tension, officials from both sides said the
incidents did not appear to be serious.
   ``There is no cause for any undue concern since we trust that
these localized incidents will be contained and the situation
defused,'' United News of India quoted Singh as saying in the
Parliament.
   Singh said directors of military operations from both countries
were in touch. He did not elaborate.
   The Pakistani official said: ``This is not a serious situation.
It's just in one sector. It could be just a local incident. We
don't know what it will lead to. We'll just have to wait and see.''
   India and Pakistan have gone to war twice over Kashmir, in 1965
and 1971. Both sides claim Kashmir, which has been divided into
Indian and Pakistani sectors.
   Tensions over Kashmir flared again this summer.
   India accuses Pakistan of supporting a Moslem secessionist
movement in the Indian sector by providing arms and training to
Moslem militants. Pakistan, an Islamic state, denies the charge but
says it will back any movement for self-determination by Kashmir's
people.
   Jammu-Kashmir state is the only one of India's states with a
Moslem majority. At least 1,034 people have been killed in the
Kashmir valley since New Delhi cracked down on the secessionist
movement on Jan. 20.
   Military officials in Jammu, the summer capital of India-held
Kashmir, said Tuesday that tanks and troops reinforcements were
dispatched to the border areas.
   At least 20 tanks and 30 trucks with soldiers left their
quarters at Kaluchak and Baridrahamna for the frontier, said
witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Indian military officials said the additional troops were sent
to Rajauri and Poonch sectors, which were the scenes of fierce
battles in the wars of 1965 and 1971.

   The White House said today the United
States had no interest in negotiating with President Saddam Hussein
while Iraq remains in Kuwait. President Bush, meanwhile, awaited
paperwork from the Pentagon to activate U.S. military reserves.
   Saddam's latest message, directed to Bush and read over Iraqi
television, was described by presidential press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater as ``much of the same rhetoric that we've heard before.
Same old litany from Iraq.''
   ``At this point, we see very little to talk about when all we
get are negative responses,'' Fitzwater told reporters accompanying
Bush to a political fund-raising golf tournament.
   Fitzwater also said there would be no announcement today on the
pending call-up of U.S. military reserves. White House officials
said earlier in the day the executive order for Bush to sign was
making its way through the bureaucracy from the Pentagon.
   The call-up, which would primarily help fill the ranks of
military doctors, cargo handlers and other specialists, could come
Wednesday after Bush meets with defense advisers.
   Asked about Iraq's suggestion for talks, Fitzwater said that
many nations of the world ``are willing to talk with Iraq, but only
in the context of compliance with the U.N. resolutions,'' which
demand a full pullout of Iraqi military forces from Kuwait.
   ``We demand a complete and unconditional withdrawal,'' Fitzwater
said.
   In Amman, Jordan, Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz said ` `We
are ready to talk.'' However, Aziz said all regional issues,
including Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, must
be on the table.
   U.S. envoy Joseph Wilson met with the Iraqi foreign ministry on
Monday and demanded access to the U.S. citizens who are being held
by the Iraqis and ``demanded they be allowed to leave.''
   ``Of course, he got no positive response,'' Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater said that 18 dependents of American diplomats managed
to escape on Monday.
   Fitzwater also said the United States continues to shadow
several ships in the Persian Gulf region to make sure none violates
the trade embargo with Iraq. However, he said, one Iraqi tanker was
being allowed to dock in a Yemen port based on assurances from the
Yemeni government that that country would not unload or use Iraqi
oil.
   That tanker and another were being tailed by the U.S. Navy,
which had fired shots across their bow. The second tanker was still
being trailed, Fitzwater said.
   President Bush rebuffed reporters' attempts to question him as
he teed off for the golf tournament to benefit the re-election
campaign of Gov. John McKernan.
   However, to underscore that Bush is conducting work during his
lengthy vacation in Maine, Fitzwater said the president had spoken
by phone this morning with U.N. Ambasssador Thomas Pickering and
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, returning from the Persian gulf,
and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Colin Powell were to meet
with Bush in Maine on Wednesday, Fitzwater said.
   The president escalated the verbal war during a trip Monday to
Washington, Baltimore and Rhode Island. He used the word
``hostages'' for the first time to describe the 3,000 Americans
trapped in Iraq and Kuwait and called Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein ``a man of evil standing against human life itself.''
   Starting his day with an early morning jog today, Bush kept his
distance from watching reporters who wanted to question him about
Persian Gulf developments. Bush has grown increasingly distant from
news media accompanying him on vacation, saying he does not want to
comment on serious world affairs while having recreation time.
   White House aides had said Monday night the president might sign
paperwork as soon as today ordering thousands of military
reservists into active duty to bolster U.S. forces depleted by the
massive deployment of troops to protect Saudi Arabia from possible
attack by Iraq.
   The White House announced Friday that Bush had decided to use
the reserves.
   Bush returned to Maine on Monday afternoon and was spending much
of today in Falmouth. He also planned to attend the funeral in
Kennebunkport of his uncle, John Walker, a retired surgeon and
investment banker, who died Thursday at 81 after suffering an
aneurism.
   Bush spent part of Monday on the telephone with foreign leaders
_ Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Great Britain, President
Francois Mitterrand of France and Turkey's President Turgut Ozal.
   He praised all three for cooperating with the United States as
it blockades ships that attempt to break the trade embargo against
Iraq. He said strategically placed Turkey took a ``courageous
stand'' in going against Iraq, its powerful neighbor.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was returning to the United States
today, claiming success after a four-day trip to six Mideast
countries seeking their support. The United Arab Emirates agreed to
host a squadron of U.S. military transport planes.
   Bush told a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Baltimore
that he was holding Iraq ``responsible for the safety of American
citizens held against their will.''
   ``Today, the outcome is not yet decided. Hard choices remain.
But of this we are certain: America will not be intimidated,'' Bush
told the veterans.

   A man trying to become the first pilot to fly
a solar-powered plane from coast to coast glided the craft across
the Mississippi River, a spokesman said.
   Eric Raymond landed the Sun-Seeker Monday in a field near
Greenville, Ill., about 50 miles from St. Louis, said flight

Fulton, Mo., he said.
   That put Raymond 1,620 miles into his trip, which began Aug. 2
in Desert Center, Calif. His destination is Kitty Hawk, N.C., where
Orville and Wilbur Wright made the first successful

   Raymond landed in a field because he couldn't reach an airport.
A wiring malfunction prevented use of the solar-powered batteries

   For many weary East German workers, the Oct.
14 unification date set by their government Tuesday is far too late.
   ``It should happen more quickly. We all want to work but our
government can't do anything,'' said construction worker Horst
Schwaebisch.
   Earlier, Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere announced that
leaders of parliamentary factions had agreed to the Oct. 14 date.
However, a political squabble later threatened to torpedo the
agreement, and one of East Germany's parties said it would push for
earlier unification.
   From the rusty bridge they were repairing, Schwaebisch and his
crew could see the West German flag flutter atop the Reichstag, the
historic site of the German parliament.
   ``Unity 
   Elsewhere in East Berlin, many expressed a similar opinion.
   But other East Germans questioned at random said things were in
fact going too fast, and they criticized the prime minister.
   ``Everything is happening in such a chaotic way. We could lose
our protection if we are just run over by West Germany,'' said
Heidi Loll, a nurse attending a protest by health care workers in
downtown East Berlin.
   ``Everything is falling apart. De Maiziere should leave politics
to real politicians,'' Ms. Kuhn added.
   Others expressed similar fears.
   ``They still have some issues to solve. Like how the economy
should be run. It's happening too fast,'' said Frank Stemmler, 27,
a former cook who now sells newspapers.
   Rapid unification delighted citizens of East Germany's Warsaw
Pact allies.
   ``The German nation should be together. The Berlin Wall is now
just a souvenir,'' said Alexei Baltyan, a worker from the Ukraine.
``There will be too many conflicts if they don't do it quickly.''
   A Ukrainian tourist had similar feelings.
   ``The quicker the better. After all, they are free now to
decide,'' said Vladimir Fedus, a worker from Lvov.
   One Polish entrepeneur agreed.
   ``It's very good. What else can I say?'' said the Pole, as he
rented hammers to tourists wanting to chip away at what is left of
the wall near the Brandenburg Gate.

   Anchorman Dan Rather and other CBS employees
left Iraq on Tuesday under the orders of Iraqi authorities, a
spokeswoman said.
   ``All of the CBS newspeople were politely asked to be out
today,'' said CBS News spokeswoman Donna Dees.
   ``We were staying as long as we could stay and not put anybody's
life in danger,'' she said. ``Clearly, we reached almost that point
where we might not have gotten out.''
   Reporters for The Associated Press and other newsgathering
organizations continue to work in Iraq, which invaded Kuwait nearly
three weeks ago.
   The CBS contingent flew to Amman, Jordan, where Rather will
continue to cover the story along with correspondents Allen Pizzey
and Peter Van Sant.
   Ms. Dees said she could not say how many CBS staffers are in
Jordan. A CBS source, however, said the network is keeping about 30
people in Jordan.
   The CBS contingent got to Baghdad on Wednesday, 12 hours after
an ABC crew led by ``Nightline'' anchorman Ted Koppel. Koppel left
Baghdad on Thursday, followed several days later by his ABC
colleagues.
   ``We have been advancing the story of the Americans left there
(in Iraq),'' Ms. Dees said. ``It's been our story all weekend.''
   CBS correspondents in the region include Bob Simon in Saudi
Arabia; Bill McLaughlin in Cairo, Doug Tunnel in Dubai, and Martha
Teischner in Tel Aviv.
   NBC's ``Nightly News'' anchor Tom Brokaw on Tuesday returned to
New York City from Saudi Arabia, where he had been anchoring the
network's coverage of the invasion.
   ``Today'' host Bryant Gumbel remains in Saudi Arabia, as does
correspondent Arthur Kent. In Amman, NBC's on-air reporting is by
correspondents Garrick Utley, Dennis Murphy and Keith Miller.
   Other NBC correspondents include Tom Aspell in Dubai, Rick Davis
and Mike Boettcher in Cairo, Tom Pettit in Iran, and Ike Seamans in
Tel Aviv.
   ``Overall, we have about 70 people involved in this coverage,
and that doesn't include translators, drivers and other support
staff,'' said NBC spokeswoman Katherine McQuay.
   ABC's coverage of the Mideast crisis is still being anchored
here by ``World News Tonight'' anchor Peter Jennings, who had been
the network's Beirut bureau chief and has anchored all special
report coverage.
   Correspondents on the story include Sam Donaldson and Mike Von
Fremd in Saudi Arabia; Jim Hickey in Cairo, Mike Lee in Dubai,
United Arab Emirates; Peter Collins in Ankara, Turkey.
   ABC has three correspondents in Amman: Forrest Sawyer, John
McKenzie and John Donvan. ABC spokesman Scott Richardson had no
exact figures on the number of people covering the story.
   The Cable News Network kept its anchor, Bernard Shaw, in
Washington. ``He's doing what he's supposed to be doing,'' said
spokeswoman Eileen Murphy.
   CNN on Tuesday had three correspondents in Amman: Rich Roth, Jim
Clancy and Robert Weiner; Christiane Amanpour and John Sweeney
covered the story from Saudi Arabia, where CNN's Carl Rochelle was
a Pentagon pool reporter.
   CNN's Jonathan Mann was shuttling between Tripoli and Cairo, and
Doug James was in Dubai. CNN also has between 45 and 50 editorial
and technical staffers on duty in the Middle East.

   The mayor may have a tough time
convincing GOP officials crime won't be a problem if they hold the

   Mayor Robert Ulrich returned from dinner Sunday with the

   Stock prices fell sharply in heavy trading today
as investors continued to worry about the prospect of war in the
Mideast.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rebounded somewhat
from its morning loss of more than 75 points but was still was down
50.50 points to 2,605.94 as of 2 p.m.
   In the broader market, declining stocks outnumbered advancing
ones by about 6 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 222 up,
1,403 down and 320 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to a strong 154.72 million shares.
   Traders said the main influence on the market was continuing
concern about the Iraqi situation. ``Everyone's just very, very
nervous here,'' said Tony Woodruff, a managing director at Kidder,
Peabody &amp; Co.
   In a speech this morning, Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, said
his nation's detention of foreigners was justified given the
aggressive response by foreign nations to Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait. Saddam also said that if the United States continues its
aggression, ``a disaster will take place concerning the whole
world.''
   Woodruff said the continuing rise in oil prices due to the
Mideast tension is of particular concern to the market. Wholesale
unleaded gasoline prices hit a new high on the New York Mercantile
Exchange for the fifth day in a row this morning.
   The plunge in the Dow twice triggered one of the NYSE's
``circuit breakers'' designed to prevent a freefall in prices. The
mechanism, set off by a 50-point Dow drop, bars a type of
computerized program trading related to stock futures until the
prices of the stocks involved rise.
   Analysts said the market was hurt by a decline in the price of
U.S. shares on foreign exchanges before the start of New York
trading.
   Stock prices fell sharply in Frankfurt, primarily because of a
rumor _ later dismissed _ that a U.S. plane was shot down over
Iraq. Share prices also were lower in London trading.
   Earlier, share prices slipped for the fourth consecutive session
in Tokyo, where the key Nikkei index lost 0.73 percent.
   The U.S. stock market also was hurt by a drop in bond prices
this morning, analysts said. But market-watchers said they expected
stocks to be most affected by any news from Iraq.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 4.80 to 175.62. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 3.92 at 327.37.

   Kathie Lee Gifford admits her on-air campaign
to win a ``Most Beautiful Woman on TV'' poll was ``totally, totally
shameless.''
   But it worked.
   Gifford, who campaigned good-naturedly and tirelessly on her
syndicated show, ``Live with Regis and Kathie Lee,'' far
outdistanced such glamorous stars as Jaclyn Smith and Connie
Sellecca in voting announced this week in TV Guide.
   ``There is no accounting for my behavior,'' Gifford said. ``I
didn't do anything illegal, though. I didn't steal anything.''
   Gifford got 17,796 phone-in votes to Smith's 3,603. Nicollette
Sheridan was third with 3,074 votes. Then came Delta Burke, Melissa
Brennan, Kirstie Alley, Dana Delany, Connie Sellecca, Stepfanie
Kramer, Jasmine Guy, Valerie Bertinelli and Phylicia Rashad.
   ``It's hysterical,'' Gifford said. ``Of course, I'm not the most
beautiful woman on TV _ but for one week, it would be great to
think so.''
   ``Too bad I don't have a TV talk show to wage a campaign,'' said
Holly Robinson of ``21 Jump Street,'' who got 674 votes.
   Vanna White received 1,291 votes, but her manager said, ``If
Vanna had done that for her 20 million viewers, she'd (have blown)
Kathie out of the water.''

   A performance by comedian Andrew Dice Clay will go
ahead Sunday, but without local sponsors.
   A Dallas radio station became the fifth group to withdraw as a
sponsor for the show at the Starplex Amphitheatre.
   Clay has drawn criticism for offensive references in his
stand-up comedy act to women, homosexuals and minorities.
   KTXQ-FM's action followed the withdrawal of Coca-Cola, Miller
beer, WFAA-TV and The Dallas Morning News. The five organizations
have been season sponsors of the theater's summer concert series.
   ``We sponsor hundreds of concerts ever year, and if it's going
to alienate people, or offend people, it's not in our best interest
to sponsor the act,'' said KTXQ program director Andy Lockridge.
   Larry Fontana, general manager for Starplex, said the show would
go on regardless of the number of sponsors. He said ticket sales
were good.

   The National Women's Hall of Fame
couldn't find a company willing to help fly tennis great Billie
Jean King to her induction ceremonies. And that upset the hall's
director.
   Emilie C. Sisson said more than 20 major corporations were asked
for a loan of a private jet or donations of $3,000 to $4,000 so one
could be rented.
   ``We're talking some of the big guys, we're talking Fortune 500
companies. . . . They all said no,'' Sisson said. ``It's partly
because it's a women's issue. It wasn't in their `interest' to do
that _ that was their primary response.''
   Sisson declined to list the companies that turned down the
hall's request. The hall instead will pay to fly King in, she said.
   The 47-year-old King, who won 20 Wimbledon titles and dominated
women's tennis for years, will be inducted into the hall Sunday
along with former U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan of Texas, tuberculosis
researcher Dr. Florence B. Seibert and the late photojournalist
Margaret Bourke-White. Neither Jordan nor Seibert can attend the
ceremony.
   King will be in New York City this weekend working as a
commentator for the U.S. Open tennis championship. No commercial
flights are available after the Sunday night ceremony that would
get her back in time for work Monday morning, Sisson said.

   County music singer Dottie West has
filed for bankruptcy reorganization, citing $1 million in debts.
   Documents filed Aug. 16 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court showed the
singer's biggest debt is a $703,090 home loan from First American
Bank.
   The bank recently foreclosed on the singer's Williamson County
house and property and she was ordered to vacate the property.
   West, best known as one of Kenny Rogers' duet partners, is a
member of the Grand Ole Opry and has recorded such hits as
``Country Sunshine'' and ``A Lesson In Leaving.'' Her ``Here Comes
My Baby'' in 1964 won country music's first Grammy Award in the
female vocalist category.
   She listed less than $500,000 in assets and more than 20
creditors, including the Internal Revenue Service.
   In a recent interview with The Tennessean newspaper, West said
she was doing fine, although her financial problems had not been
easy.
   ``I'm a survivor. You can knock me down, but you better have a
big rock to keep me there,'' she said.

   ``Cheers'' star Ted Danson was late
for an appearance at an American Oceans Campaign benefit because a
truckload of tuna overturned on the freeway, backing up traffic for
miles.
   More than 200 partygoers awaited the appearance of Danson, who
was stuck on Interstate 5 with thousands of other motorists.
   ``Here we are at a `Celebration of the Sea' and there are 40,000
pounds of canned tuna on the highway. I think there's some irony in
that,'' said Eric Hansen, a benefit organizer.
   Danson, president and co-founder of the American Oceans
Campaign, finally made his entrance Friday 20 minutes before the
party's end. The organization is dedicated to the protection and
restoration of the ocean.
   ``I grew up in Arizona, the son of an archaeologist. I was
instilled with the thought that there is lots that came before us
and lots will come after us. It gave me a sense of stewardship,''
said Danson.
   ``We thought we'd concentrate all our money, all our energy and
all our time into one area and see what kind of impact we can
make.''
   The benefit also featured appearances by actors John
Ratzenberger, Woody Harrelson, Ed Begley Jr., Robert Urich and

<TEXT>
   Eleven convicts from a Siberian labor
camp who hijacked a Soviet jetliner to Pakistan and requested
political asylum will go on trial here, the state-run television
said Tuesday.
   However, the Soviet news agency Tass reported that the hijackers
would be extradited to the Soviet Union. There was no explanation
for the differing the reports.
   The Soviets surrendered Monday two hours after the Aeroflot
Tupolev 154, with 29 passengers and nine crew members, landed in
the city of Karachi.
   The late evening news on Pakistan's official television network
said the hijackers were being interrogated and would be put on
trial in Pakistan. A Foreign Office spokesman said no formal
extradition request had been received from Moscow.
   Earlier, Tass quoted Gulyam Aliyev, deputy KGB chairman in the
Uzbekistan republic of the Soviet Union, as saying Soviet law
officers would travel to Karachi to escort the prisoners home.
   Pakistan has in the past refused to extradite hijackers,
preferring to put them on trial here. Palestinian guerrillas
involved in a 1986 Pan Am hijacking that ended in Karachi were
tried in Pakistan. One was sentenced to death and the others to
lengthy prison terms. The death sentence has not been carried out.
   The Soviet hijacking began Sunday when convicts from a Siberian
labor camp overpowered their guards and took over the jetliner as
it was flying from Neryungry, where the prison is located, to the
nearby city of Yakutsk.
   The prisoners forced the commerical aircraft back to Neryungry,
where six prisoners and 41 women and children left the plane. Two
more convicts then boarded, and the aircraft flew west to
Krasnoyarsk in Siberia.
   After two hours of negotiations, the aircraft was refueled and
flew to the Soviet city of Tashkent, where a new crew came on board
and the hijackers demanded to leave the country.
   They originally wanted to go to New Delhi but were allowed to
land in Karachi because the plane was low on fuel.
   There have been at least 13 hijackings or attempted hijackings
of Soviet aircraft since late May.
   Tass quoted Deputy Interior Minister Ivan Shilov as saying there
would be an investigation into how the convicts managed to
commandeer the plane. The news agency said one of the prisoners
apparently smuggled weapons onto the fight in an artificial limb.

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson said today he is trying
to arrange a trip to Iraq as a television journalist to interview
Iraqi officials and American hostages for his new syndicated talk
show.
   Jackson told reporters the government of Iraq had indicated that
he could interview officials in Baghdad and talk to Americans held
hostages in that country.
   ``The Jesse Jackson Show,'' which is schecduled to begin next
month, is syndicated by Time-Warner Inc., which Jackson said would
help underwrite the trip.
   Jackson, who previously has played a role as a diplomat in
seeking to free an American pilot held in Syria, said the purpose
of the trip to Iraq would be purely journalistic.
   ``Our purpose will be to communicate with high Iraqi officials
and to communicate with Americans held hostage there just as
various news organizations have sought to do,'' Jackson told a news
conference.
   ``It would not be appropriate to go there as a diplomat,'' he
said.
   ``In this case it would interfere with what is a growing
crisis,'' said Jackson, who in 1984 traveled to Syria to gain the
release of Lt. Robert Goodman, a Navy pilot who had been shot down.
   But Jackson indicated that he hoped his trip would help
encourage a diplomatic solution.
   ``Something must happen, hopefully through communications and
dialogue, that will help break the cycle that is leading to an
impending disaster unless it breaks,'' Jackson said.
   ``We are not certain just yet as to what our government's plans
are for that area,'' Jackson said. ``If on the one hand it is
military deterrence and diplomatic initiatives, then communications
could facilitate a level of dialogue that appears to be closing.''
   ``If in fact, the (American) mission is an offensive military
effort, then even communications would be challenged,'' Jackson
said.
   Jackson stressed that the trip would be a news-gathering effort.
   ``The American people here have a great interest in seeing and
hearing from their loved ones who are now held hostage and captive
in Iraq and in Kuwait,'' Jackson said.
   ``We have received communications from the Iraqi government that
communicating with high Iraqi officials and the Americans held
hostages there would be possible,'' Jackson said.

   East Germany's unruly political factions
briefly put aside their differences Tuesday and set an Oct. 14 date
to unify the troubled nation with West Germany.
   But hours later, the Social Democatic Party said it wanted the
date set a month earlier and would challenge the agreement. Richard
Schroeder, the Social Democratic leader who had agreed to the Oct.
14 date, resigned as chief of his faction in Parliament.
   The Social Democrats were meeting to assess whether they could
muster the votes to torpedo the Oct. 14 arrangement worked out by
Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere's broad coalition government.
   De Maiziere is seeking a definitive timetable for the merger of
the German states and the dissolution of economically battered East
Germany.
   Under the agreement, the two German states will legally become a
single nation Oct. 14. Germans on both sides are tentatively set to
elect a common government in December.
   After meeting with the leaders of other parties in Parliament,
de Maiziere said lawmakers would convene Oct. 9 to formalize the
unification date. This was before Schroeder announced his move.
   Oct. 9 is the first anniversary of a large demonstration in
Leipzig, East Germany, which fueled other pro-democracy protests.
The demonstrations spread across the country, eventually bringing
down the Communist regime that had ruled four decades.
   Alluding to the attempt by lawmakers to capture the spirit of
grass-roots solidarity that toppled the old regime, de Maiziere
said Parliament will convene under the motto: ``Where we come from,
where we want to go.''
   De Maiziere's conservative Christian Democrats, the nation's
second-largest party, and the left-leaning Social Democrats, who
abandoned de Maizeire's coalition two days ago, agreed on the
October date. Also agreeing were the former Communists, the
third-largest party in Parliament; and the small Buendnis 90
coalition that includes the intellectuals and activists who led
last year's revolt.
   The basic position of the Social Democrats was that unification
should take place Sept. 15 because of East Germany's serious
economic problems.
   Christian Democrats in both German states wanted to keep the
date of unification and elections for a united Parliament as close
together as possible.
   The Social Democrats said this was because Christian Democrats,
including West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, were trying to win
the election before West Germans realized the true cost of bailing
out East Germany.
   Dec. 2 has been scheduled for elections for a united Parliament.
   Many details remain to be worked out. The fighting between
political parties in both Germanys, essentially in the throes of an
election campaign, will likely resurface.
   How to distribute East German property _ some of which is
claimed by West Germans who fled the region after the Soviet
invasion of World War II _ has been a roadblock to a political
treaty that is to mesh the two countries.
   East Germany became a free market July 1. Joblessness has since
skyrocketed as enterprises struggle to compete with Western
competition.
   Regine Hildebrandt, a Social Democrat who resigned as labor
minister Tuesday in keeping with her party's decision to leave de
Maiziere's government, said 25,000 East Germans are losing their
jobs weekly.
   Unemployment was pegged officially at about 270,000 at the end
of July, but more than a million people are being kept on payrolls
at reduced hours and wages under a program financed by West Germany.
   Joblessness is expected to exceed 3 million of the nation's 8.8
million workers. Unrest among workers has been widespread.
   Sirens screamed around the prime minister's office Tuesday as
about 1,000 public employees, including firefighters and ambulance
drivers, rallied outside to demand better wages. Bus drivers joined
by parking their vehicles for an hour.
   Several hundred doctors and nurses protested in front of the
Health Ministry to demand that their clinics be privatized. Similar
protests were held in Cottbus, Dresden and other cities.

   The State Department said today a U.S. citizen
in Kuwait was taken from his home by the Iraqi military, increasing
the number of Americans believed under Iraqi control to 54. Some
westerners have been moved to Iraqi industrial installations, the
department said.
   Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the unidentified
American and eight British citizens were ``rounded up from their
homes'' by Iraqi soldiers who apparently forced a Kuwaiti man at
gunpoint to identify homes of westerners.
   Boucher said the American was taken to the Meridien Hotel in
Kuwait, where he was seen by U.S. consular officials who said he
was ``okay.''
   ``We have credible reports that some westerners have been moved
to Iraqi industrial installations,'' Boucher said. He said he did
not know the number or whether any of them were Americans.
   Boucher also said the department had confirmed a report that
eight American citizens crossed the border from Kuwait into Saudia
Arabia on Monday. He said they evidently acted on their own,
without any approval from Iraqi authorities.
   ``The United States will continue to press Iraq by all means
available to fulfill its obligation to the safety and welfare of
foreign citizens in Kuwait and Iraq by allowing them to leave,''
Boucher said. ``The United States will not negotiate concessions in
return for what is an international obligation on the part of
Iraq.''
   Boucher also said 18 U.S. diplomats had driven across the border
from Iraq into Jordan, leaving about 10 in the American embassy in
Baghdad.
   Earlier, Boucher said the United States was protesting the
removal of 12 to 14 Americans and other foreign nationals from
Kuwaiti hotels to undisclosed locations.
   Boucher said Monday that at least one family was among the
Americans taken from two hotels in Kuwait City. He said he did not
know if there were any children.
   Thirty-five Americans taken earlier from Kuwait and placed in
the Rashid hotel in Baghdad were removed last week, and Boucher
said they remain unaccounted for despite repeated U.S. inquiries.
   Six Americans were already living in the hotel, and Boucher said
they have not been heard from.
   An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said at least 12 and possibly 14 Americans were taken from the
Hyatt Regency and the Kuwait International hotels.
   The whereabouts of the Americans was unknown, Boucher said. They
are among an estimated 2,500 Americans in the Persian Gulf country
that was overrun by Iraqi forces Aug. 2.
   An additional 530 or so Americans are trapped in Iraq, and
Boucher said securing all the Americans' safety was the
administration's ``prime concern.''
   Iraq announced it had carried out a plan to move Western
hostages to vital military installations to deter any U.S. attack.
It warned Iraqi citizens not to try to hide any of the thousands of
foreigners trapped in the country.
   President Bush referred to the trapped Americans as hostages for
the first time Monday while addressing a Veterans of Foreign Wars
meeting in Baltimore.
   ``Whatever these innocent people are called, they are in fact
hostages,'' Bush said. Previously, the administration had avoided
using that word.
   A State Department spokeswoman said U.S. consular officers are
answering about 4,000 telephone calls a day from relatives of the
Americans.
   Judith Baroody, press officer for the special task force set up
by the department to deal with the Persian Gulf crisis, said from
60 to 80 officers staff the telephone bank 24 hours a day, in
shifts of 15 at one time. The telephone number is (202) 647-0900.
   The State Department also announced that non-essential diplomats
and dependents are leaving Jordan, which borders Iraq. The
department said there are about 5,000 Americans in Jordan _ 4,700
private citizens and the rest official.
   Non-government Americans in Jordan were advised to consider
leaving. Similar instructions were issued for Yemen, which lies far
beyond Iraq on the Arabian Sea.

   Two former congressmen cut short a private
fact-finding trip to Iraq today and flew to Amman, Jordan, on a
plane carrying CBS anchorman Dan Rather and others.
   Former Rep. George Hansen, R-Idaho, said he and former Rep.
Thomas Kindness, R-Ohio, and an interpreter were in Iraq under the
auspices of Hansen's Free America Foundation.
   Hansen said that he and Kindness were examining U.S. policy in
the Middle East, but provided few details beyond that.
   He said they flew to Amman on an aircraft filled with
foreigners, including Rather and a CBS network crew of eight.
   In a telephone interview from Amman, Hansen said he and Kindness
``went out and tested the water everywhere we could, and we did it
substantially alone, and I guess I can't say that it was
uncomfortable being there.''
   The two tried to find out about Americans who had been stranded
in Baghdad after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait but had only
mixed success, Hansen told AP Network News.
   ``Some of them apparently had made their way home,'' Hansen
said. ``Others were still in Iraq but had joined, apparently, some
of the others that were also detained there and had been farmed out
as quote, guests, end quote, in the smaller villages around some of
the defense installations and that type of thing.''
   Hansen is a former seven-term GOP congressman who served 11
months in prison after his 1984 conviction on four counts of filing
false financial disclosure statements to Congress. He was released
from federal prison in October, 1987.
   Kindness represented the 8th Congressional District in western
Ohio for 12 years until 1986, when he made an unsuccessful bid to
oust Sen. John Glenn, a Democrat. He became a lobbyist in
Washington but ran for re-election to Congress, losing in the
Republican primary in May.

   Supporters of U.S. military action in the Middle East are
hanging out flags and baking cookies, and pacifist groups are
staging what one termed the opening shots of an anti-war movement.
   ``It's happening too fast for people to actually comprehend,''
said Doug Rand, a spokesman for the Resource Center for Nonviolence
in Santa Cruz, Calif.
   In Lake Worth, Fla., about 20 self-described ``neo-hippies''
protested the U.S. military action Sunday by walking across the
Lake Worth bridge carrying signs saying ``Love Life'' and ``Peace
for our Children.''
   ``I know it's an unpopular opinion, but it needs to be said,''
said the group's leader, Elizabeth Dick, an editor for the National
Examiner. ``Under no circumstances should the United States take
military action. ... I think the U.S. is being used to do the
world's dirty work.''
   A small group of Rhode Islanders took to the streets Monday in
Providence.
   ``U.S. troops out of the Middle East. No war for the oil
companies and Wall Street. Money for jobs, homes, schools at home,
not war abroad,'' their banner said.
   ``We're responding like in 1963 when advisers were sent to
Vietnam,'' said Bill Bateman of the All Peoples Congress. ``This is
the opening shot of an anti-war movement.''
   Accompanied by chants and the beating of a Buddhist prayer drum,
16 protesters blocked the main gate of Westover Air Force Base,
home of C-5A cargo planes, for about two hours Monday at Chicopee,
Mass.
   ``Those C-5As can carry troops to Saudi Arabia, nuclear weapons
and chemical weapons. We want the people flying those planes to
think about the decision they're making. It's a moral decision,''
said Renard Thompson of Colebrook, Conn.
   But in Davie, Fla., a suburb of Fort Lauderdale, Ron Morrison
and his neighbors hung yellow ribbons on their houses, trees and
cars in honor of the American soldiers, including his son, whose
Army unit had left Fort Stuart in Georgia.
   While convoys of Army equipment headed from Fort Campbell, Ky.,
to Jacksonville, Fla., during the past week, hundreds of people
lined Interstates 24 and 75 in Chattanooga, Tenn., waving flags and
holding up signs of support.
   Georgia residents turned out about 20 at a time at highway
overpasses to cheer convoys from the 101st Airborne Division at
Fort Campbell, Ky. The soldiers were moving their equipment through
the state on their way to Mayport, Fla., for shipment to the
Mideast.
   In southern California, Moreno Valley residents prepared more
than 200 dozen cookies for Marines scheduled for deployment to the
Middle East. The cookies were baked Sunday by 26 residents and
taken to the Red Cross at March Air Force Base.
   About 50 people tied a red-white-and-blue ribbon around the town
flag pole in Naugatuck, Conn., on Sunday. They were led by Eileen
Bronko, who wants people to put up the ribbons to show U.S.
soldiers that the country cares about them and not just about oil
prices.

   Hang gliders are swooping down over isolated
forest areas to report illegal dumping, maverick skeet shooters and
possible arsonist activity in aerial spying that has authorities
delighted.
   Members of the Sylmar Hang Gliding Association hope they will
deter people from dumping stolen cars over the sides of cliffs and
shooting guns illegally in the Angeles National Forest, said group
spokesman Rome Dodson.
   ``I hate to see couches and stoves dumped up here because it's
such a beautiful area,'' said member Robert Laukka, 28, of Thousand
Oaks.
   The watch group was started to try to change the image of hang
gliders as danger-loving and foolhardy.
   ``If our watch stops one person from doing something wrong, it
will be worth it,'' Dodson said.
   The club launched its anti-crime effort Friday. Soaring through
the air with cameras in hand thousands of feet above the ground,
they take pictures of cars in isolated areas with lightweight,
disposable cameras, Dodson said.
   Records of the vehicles will be kept and, if there's a fire,
they will report the information to rangers or police.
   ``I personally think it is a very good idea,'' said Jim Sanchez,
chief of air operations for the Los Angeles County Fire Department.
``Whatever these folks can do, we appreciate it.''
   Ninety-three fires have burned so far this summer in the
690,000-acre forest, said spokesman Jim Stump. Twenty of those
fires were started by arsonists who have not been captured.
   ``It's been a bad year in terms of number of fires started, but
we've been lucky only 1,735 acres have burned,'' Stump said.
``Every little bit the hang gliders can do helps.''
   ``Watching out for arsonists will save us sky-bums a lot of
grief,'' said Bob Lafay, 56, of suburban Tujunga. The forest launch
pads are closed during fires.

<HEAD>Saddam's Foes Stand Tough Despite Hostage Threats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS WAGNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Arab and Western nations toughened their resolve against Saddam
Hussein on Tuesday, condemning his threats against the hostages and
adding more muscle to the force intended to strangle his economy
and drive him out of Kuwait.
   In an address to President Bush, Saddam defended detaining
foreigners and promised ``a major catastrophe'' if fighting breaks
out in the Persian Gulf. Iraq's defense minister, Tariq Aziz,
called for a negotiated settlement but did not offer to withdraw
Iraqi troops from Kuwait and restore its monarchy.
   Egypt, which has led the Arab opposition to the invasion, urged
Saddam to withdraw from Kuwait or face a war ``that will devour
everything.''
   Syria formally announced that it was sending troops to Saudi
Arabia.
   Yemen promised to turn away an Iraqi oil tanker, but questions
about its intentions surfaced when at least two Iraqi oil tankers
appeared in its port.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher refused to negotiate with Iraq
to win freedom for Britain's 4,500 hostages, and she urged the
United Nations to authorize the use military action to stop Iraqi
tankers in the Persian Gulf.
   ``As President Bush pointed out yesterday, Saddam Hussein is
trying in his tactics to hide behind Western women and children and
use them as human shields and use them as part of his
negotiations,'' she said at a news conference.
   At the first all-European meeting on the crisis, Spain, Belgium,
the Netherlands and Italy said in Paris they were sending warships
to the region.
   To bolster U.S. forces depleted by the massive deployment of
troops in Saudi Arabia, Bush planned to order thousands of military
reservists into active duty. Administration officials said the
executive order would probably be open-ended, allowing the Pentagon
to call up reserves as needed.
   In the Persian Gulf, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney met with
Saudi officials to share military intelligence and discuss the
possible sale of additional F-15 fighters and heavy tanks to
bolster the kingdom's defenses.
   In the face of all this activity, Iraq's leaders again predicted
that Iraq's vast army would decimate the U.S.-led multinational
force in a war.
   ``The Americans have prepared the ground for a war of
aggression. If the Americans think this is a vacation like they had
in Panama and Grenada, this will be a bloody conflict and America
will lose and be humiliated,'' Aziz said.
   Saddam defended his decision to round up thousands of
Westerners, including 3,000 Americans, and use them as a shield
around military facilities.
   In a speech on Iraqi television, the Iraqi president said:
   ``Banning some foreigners from travel is not motivated by
vengeance, but rather a measure to prevent a crime of aggression
which President Bush intends to commit against the people of Iraq
after his crime of occupying the land of Mecca and the shrine of
the prophet Mohammed. If he commits this crime, a major catastrophe
will befall not only the region but also the world.''
   He denounced the United States for rejecting his offer Sunday to
free foreigners if the United States withdraws its forces from
Saudi Arabia and guarantees that the economic embargo against Iraq
will be lifted.
   Aziz, who spoke with reporters in Jordan, also said Iraq was
prepared to end the crisis through negotiations, but neither he nor
Saddam offered to withdraw the Iraqi troops that overran Kuwait on
Aug. 2.
   Iraq had accused Kuwait of depriving it of vital oil revenue by
stealing oil from a field that includes land both sides claim, and
by cheating on its OPEC production quotas and contributing to the
world oil glut.
   ``We are ready to talk,'' Aziz said. ``My president made
proposals that we are ready to put all the cards on the table'' at
the U.N. Security Council.
   Aziz said such a meeting should resolve all conflicts in the
Persian Gulf, including the Palestinian uprising in Israel.
   Although the minister said he had carried a message from Saddam
to Jordan's government, he declined to discuss its contents.
Jordan, a U.S. and Iraqi ally, has not fully committed itself to
the international embargo and Iraqi goods continue to pass through
Jordan's port of Aqaba on the Red Sea.
   Iraq, meanwhile, has moved sufrace-to-surface Scud missiles into
occupied Kuwait, increasing the threat of a chemical weapons
attack, Brig. Gen. Turki Bin Nassar, a Saudi base commander told
reporters in the kingdom on Tuesday.
   But he said that U.S. and Saudi forces have defenses against the
Scuds, including U.S. Patriot anti-missiles in place in Saudi
Arabia.
   In the Persian Gulf, shipping radios crackled with conversation
as U.S. and British warships challenged almost every commercial
vessel in the southern reaches of the waterway, according to
shipping executives in Bahrain.
   There were more than 25 U.S. warships including three aircraft
carriers in the region. Britain, France, the Soviet Union and West
Germany also have warships in the area. Belgium and Australia have
vessels on the way.

   Asian organized crime groups are spreading
into this country along with a brisk trade in heroin and soon could
be double the size of the Cosa Nostra in its heyday, a Senate
chairman said Tuesday.
   ``Asian Triads will be the dominant organized crime force in
this country by the middle of this decade,'' Chairman Joseph R.
Biden, D-Del., told a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.
   He said Triads _ highly secretive criminal societies born in
China centuries ago _ could have 9,000 members in the United States
in 10 years. That is double the Justice Department estimate of Cosa
Nostra strength at its peak in the 1960s.
   FBI officials confirmed the problem is growing.
   ``It's coming at us and its coming at us real quick and we
better be ready,'' said Robert M. Bryant, deputy assistant director
in the FBI's criminal investigative division.
   Biden and Bryant both stressed that criminals represent only a
tiny slivver of the Asian-American community. ``Most
Asian-Americans are hard-working, law-abiding, patriotic
citizens,'' Bryant said.
   He also said the problem of Asian organized crime is broader
than the Chinese Triads. But he said they were among the most
dangerous groups.
   He said the Triads, with an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 members
in Hong Kong plus two large groups in Taiwan, in many ways resemble
the organized crime groups that rose to power in America in the
bootlegger era.
   The two are similar in traits ranging from the use of secret
signs and oaths to infiltration of legitimate businesses, according
to documents released by the committee.
   Bryant said the success of law enforcement in fighting heroin
imported by traditional mobsters from the processing mills of
Marseilles has created a market opening for even purer shipments
from Southeast Asia.
   The heroin, much of it coming from a rebel army based in the
jungles of Burma, is shipped to Singapore and Taiwan and from there
to Seattle and Vancouver, Bryant said. He said most of it goes from
there to New York for distribution throughout the country.
   Since 1985, Southeast Asian heroin as a percentage of all heroin
seizures in the United States has increased from 14 percent to 43
percent, Bryant said. He said purity has increased from 3 percent
to 5 percent in the early 1980s to 40 percent to 50 percent in
major East Coast cities now.
   The bulk of the heroin enters the United States as seemingly
legitimate cargo, FBI officials said. They said the traditional
silence of the Triads and the fear of retribution from them has
made it hard to gather evidence. But they added that some progress
has been made.
   In one notable case, code named White Mare, a cooperative
witness told agents of a New York-based heroin broker. Electronic
surveillance turned up five other narcotics organizations, one
directly linked to the Shan United Army of General Khnu Sa, based
in the Burmese jungle.
   As a result, FBI agents and New York police in February 1989
seized 850 pounds of 90 percent pure heroin, the largest domestic
heroin seizure ever. Twenty-six individuals were arrested in the
United States and 18 overseas and $4.5 million in cash was seized.

   A United Airlines Boeing 737 jetliner with
107 people was unable to lock its right landing gear and skidded to
a safe emergency landing Tuesday, officials said.
   The jet's right main gear would not lock and the pilot set the
plane down at Los Angeles International on the nose gear, left main
gear and the engine under the right wing, said Federal Aviation
Administration spokesman Fred O'Donnell.
   The 102 passengers and five crew members slid down emergency
chutes, he said.
   Flight 1257 from Oakland was approaching
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport at 9 a.m. when a cockpit light
indicated an unsafe landing gear, O'Donnell said.
   The pilot made two low passes over the Burbank tower so
officials could see if the gear was extended, O'Donnell said. The
jet diverted to Los Angeles International.
   FAA and National Transportation Safety Board inspectors were
investigating.
   Passengers were bused to Burbank Airport, said United Airline
spokesman Alan Wayne.

<HEAD>Former KGB General Wins First Round of Parliamentary Election,
Faces Runoff</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former KGB general who has denounced the secret
police's tactics outpolled 20 other candidates, including a
cosmonaut, in the first round of elections to represent southern
Russia in parliament.
   The former spy, Oleg D. Kalugin, now faces a runoff election
against an agricultural official, Nikolai Gorovoi, the Soviet press
agency Tass reported Tuesday.
   If Kalugin is elected to represent Krasnodar province in the
Congress of People's Deputies, he will gain parliamentary immunity,
allowing him to continue to criticize the KGB without fear of
prosecution.
   After Kalugin publicly accused the secret police in June of
resisting reform and continuing to carry out dirty tricks, he was
dismissed and stripped of his rank, becoming an unlikely hero to
Soviet radicals.
   The Soviet prosecutor has been investigating him under a law
that prohibits divulging state secrets, but no formal charges have
been filed.
   The 55-year-old former major general, who was a KGB agent in the
United States throughout the 1960s, has hurt the KGB's recent
effort to improve its image. The secret police _ long associated
with purges and repression _ reorganized itself this year,
officially eliminating the directorate responsible for harassment
of dissidents. It has undertaken a public relations campaign aimed
at inspiring trust instead of fear.
   Kalugin has insisted that the KGB still infiltrates trade unions
and the Russian Orthodox Church, taps the telephones of many
citizens and engages in dirty tricks abroad.
   Tass said about 60 percent of the voters turned out for Sunday's
election in Krasnodar, a heavily agricultural region along the
Black Sea about 750 miles south of Moscow. The runoff election,
scheduled Sept. 2, is necessary because none of the 21 candidates
won a clear majority of the votes.
   Interfax, an independent Soviet news service, said Kalugin
received 959,082 votes, just under 45 percent of the total number
cast. Gorovoi, the next highest vote-getter, received 227,572
votes, or nearly 11 percent. He is deputy chairman of the regional
agro-industrial committee and previously served as chairman of a
collective farm.
   Among the other candidates were Anatoly Berezovoi, a pilot and
cosmonaut who took a 211-day space flight in 1982, and Gen.
Vladimir Sein, political chief of the Transcaucasian Military
District. Their vote totals were unavailable.
   The KGB and its supporters attempted to discredit Kalugin before
the election, and one resident said in a letter to the newspaper
Arguments and Facts that it was rumored people who voted for
Kalugin would be imprisoned.
   Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, said Tuesday the election

   Government and black leaders
Tuesday made a joint plea for peace as the death toll from 10 days
of tribal fighting topped 400.
   President F.W. de Klerk conferred separately with Zulu leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Gen. Bantu Holomisa, head of the Xhosa
homeland of Transkei, to discuss fighting in black townships around
Johannesburg between Zulus and Xhosas.
   ``Not only must the bloodshed cease, the war of words must
cease,'' the government and the black leaders said in a joint
statement after the talks in Pretoria. ``This has often been
interpreted at grass-roots level as license for violence.''
   Whether the talks will calm the townships remained in doubt.
   Holomisa leads a nominally independent homeland in the southeast
part of the country far away from the fighting. He is an ally of
the African National Congress, the largest black opposition
movement, but he has no real influence outside his region.
   Buthelezi's supporters have been fighting rivals in the eastern
province of Natal for five years.
   The ANC, led by Nelson Mandela, was not represented at Tuesday's
meetings.
   The fighting since Aug. 12 has pitted Zulus loyal to Buthelezi's
conservative Inkatha movement against Xhosas, most of them
followers of the ANC.
   Buthelezi said he had met privately with top ANC leaders in
recent weeks to discuss the violence, but he would not identify
them. He reiterated his call for an immediate meeting with Mandela.
   Buthelezi said Mandela had ``almost been throttled by members of
his own leadership'' for suggesting such a meeting.
   Holomisa, meanwhile, charged in a statement that South African
police have been aiding Inkatha fighters in the recent unrest.
Police have repeatedly denied such accusations.
   The Zulus and Xhosas have battled with guns, machetes, spears,
clubs and axes in the some of the worst township violence since
nationwide unrest during the mid-1980s.
   Police said the death toll had reached 405 by Tuesday night.
There were several scattered clashes, but no major fighting
reported Tuesday.
   The Johannesburg-area fighting has marked the spread of
political violence from Natal Province, where Inkatha-ANC fighting
has killed some 5,000 blacks since 1986.
   The ANC has rejected a face-to-face meeting with Buthelezi since
fighting began in Johannesburg. Mandela canceled a meeting with
Buthelezi earlier this year, reportedly because of pressure from
ANC leaders in Natal.
   The ANC contends Buthelezi is trying to broaden Inkatha's
constituency beyond Natal by instigating violence against ANC
supporters around Johannesburg.
   Buthelezi and other Inkatha leaders contend the ANC is not
willing to tolerate any rivals and seeks to monopolize political
power.
   Both the ANC and Inkatha oppose apartheid, the system of racial
segregation that allows 5 million whites to maintain political and
economic control over 30 million blacks. But the two groups differ
over tactics and plans for a future South Africa.

<HEAD>Pakistan Removes Spy Chief; He's Latest Bhutto Ally to Go</HEAD>

   The military-backed government
removed the nation's spy chief Tuesday, marking the latest in a
string of dismissals of ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's
associates.
   Shumsur Rehman Kallue, a retired army general and head of the
Inter Services Intelligence, was replaced by Maj. Gen. Mahmood
Durrani, a former aide to Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq. Zia, who
overthrew Ms. Bhutto's father in 1977 and ruled Pakistan for 11
years, died in a mysterious plane crash in August 1988.
   In announcing Kallue's dismissal, a Defense Ministry spokesman
said: ``He was an officer with a very good reputation. There was no
friction between him and the army.''
   The ISI, comparable to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency,
served as Washington's conduit for arms shipments to the Moslem
guerrillas fighting to overthrow the Soviet-backed government in
neighboring Afghanistan.
   Ms. Bhutto's 20-month-old government was dismissed Aug. 6 on
charges of corruption, ineptitude and abuse of power. It was
replaced by a caretaker government seen by many as a thinly
disguised form of military rule.
   The new government, composed of some of Ms. Bhutto's former
allies and fiercest opponents, has removed several of her political
appointees, including a number of ambassadors.
   Kallue's appointment as head of the ISI last year created an
uproar within the military, and it was seen as a victory over
Pakistan's army chief of staff, Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, who had
submitted his own candidate.
   The ISI is closely linked to the military, and Ms. Bhutto's
appointment of Kallue was seen as an attempt to distance the
intelligence bureau from the military.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Following is the text of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's message to President Bush carried by the official
Iraqi News Agency in Arabic and translated by The Associated Press:
   ``Once again, U.S. President George Bush stood before the
American people to twist words, hide facts or part of the facts,
and confuse causes with results.
   ``In his speech yesterday, 20th of August, 1990, before American
war veterans, he referred to the Americans in Iraq and stressed on
calling them hostages, despite Iraqi declarations that clarified
beyond any doubt that the Americans are here as result of a real
aggression launched against the Arab nation and Iraq by President
Bush himself and his ally (British Prime Minister Margaret)
Thatcher.
   ``Had this aggression not occurred, had President Bush
considered realistically the interests of the American people then
none of what happened to the Americans and others would have
happened. Nevertheless, what happened to them remains the lightest
all the formulas that such circumstances require, even by the
stands of America itself.
   ``President Bush know, or should know, that America itself and
during World War II had interned tens of thousands of its citizens
simply because they were of Japanese origin and based this action
on the theory of deterring larger harm by lesser, or smaller harm.
   ``So if this precedent already exists and is recorded in the
files of the United States of America along with other actions
recorded in the files on humanity, isn't it a form of racial
discrimination when what is allowed for other nations, including
the Americans, is not allowed for the Arabs, including the Iraqis?
   ``Despite all this, the Iraqis have stated clearly that what has
happened was a force majeure dictated by the circumstances among
many other options.''
   ``And we regret what happened.
   ``Preventing some foreigners from traveling is not an act of
vengeance, but a force majeure to deter a crime of aggression
President Bush intends to commit against the people of Iraq after
the crime he committed in occupying the Shrine of Kaaba (Mecca) and
the tomb of the Prophet (Medina), and should he proceed to commit
this crime, then a major catastrophe will befall not only this
region but the entire world.
   ``Bush continues in his speech to talk about the outlaws,
comparing clearly between Iraq and its representatives and Hitler,
forgetting that all these descriptions apply to him because Iraq
did not send its fleets and aircraft to attack Europe or America.
It is Bush and those whom he dragged with him to the cliff who were
the ones who embarked the aircraft and ships and invaded our
region. After desecrating our sanctities, they want to kill the
people and rob them of their human rights.
   ``Is there any doubt that these descriptions apply to Presient
Bush when he is seeking to fuel a war that might burn the entire
world? Is there a better proof of his intentions after he
stonewalled all the initiatives and solutions which we had offered
for settling the main problem or the issue of the foreigners which
is a result of the main problem?
   ``It is undoubtedly misbehavior, a reflection of poor insight
and wisdom, for the White House to reject our initiative of the
12th of August 1990, a few hours after it was aired before
President Bush took it upon himself to request official text to
guard against inaccuracy in translation or deficiency in phrases
for technical reasons.
   ``Is this possible, President of the United States of America?
   ``He who does not want history to link him to the basic
characteristics of Hitler, must search thoroughly for peaceful
means and not rush into preparations for war.
   ``What we presented in our initiative of the 12th of August
1990, and in our letter to the families of the foreigners whom the
National Council decided to host, is a clear way for anyone to
distance himself from the basic descriptions of Hitler.
   ``Characteristics of love and peace that are desired by the
peoples of the world.
   ``At the same time, we defend, without fear from any arrogant
and sinful tyrant or aggressor, the principles of our religion and
holy shrines and the honor of the homeland and nation, even all the
values of humanity combined.
   ``The claim that the American forces have come here to defend
Saudi Arabia does not stand in the face of the conflicting fact
because the reality is that we have no intention of attacking Saudi
Arabia or any other country.
   ``However, to say that your forces came here to defend American
interests: you know that the Arabs, including Iraq, are not opposed
to legitimate interests, whether they be the West's in general, or
the United States.'
   ``You also know that prosperity, scientific and technical
development and the promotion and flourishing of growth, cannot be
achieved in the way the Arabs want it to without the West's
cooperation.
   ``To achieve this, the Arabs have to sell oil. The major oil
market is Europe and the United States, in addition to Japan.
   ``I assume that President Bush knows that Iraq, for example,
sold a third of its oil to the United States until the 2nd of
August 1990, and that Iraq was against the feverish price increases
that took place in 1973. We have documents to prove that.
   ``At any rate, the Arabs, including Iraq, wish to sell their oil
for all the purposes we have already mentioned, not to drink it or
freeze it.
   ``The fact that Iraq owns about 20 percent of the world's oil
reserves does not annul the principles we have already referred to.
   ``If whoever owns oil is boycotted by the world, it would be all
the more reason for the world to boycott America and the Saudi
Arabian government.
   ``After all, is not food more vital to the human being than oil?
   ``We answer by saying `yes.' By all human standards, it is more
vital than oil. The human being cannot survive without food.
   ``If President Bush's criteria for boycotts, hostility, war and
siege are applicable to Iraq merely because it will, or that it
already does, own 20 percent of the world's oil reserves, then it
is all the more reason that these standards, in every sense, be
applied to those who own the same percentage or more of food,
primarily grain.
   ``Then what is required is that the world stand against America
and Australia.
   ``But if U.S. interests have become so small and narrow in
Bush's view that they are restricted to the relations between Bush
and (Saudi King) Fahd before Bush's assumption of the presidency
and followed his election; and if their interests have become so
narrow that they do not consider them as they should in terms of
good and positive relations with a large and great nation, but
consider them only with Jaber al-Ahmed, the Croesus of Kuwait, and
his band, who is unable to construct a useful sentence and who,
along with people like him, has been a source of shame to the Arabs
and proof to the West of their backwardness, then, you will be
cursed by what you are doing.
   ``Before concluding my letter, I would like to say that the
source of potential and power, Mr. Bush, does not lie in the size
of armies and technological superiority, nor in your alliance with
those who betrayed their nation and people. It lies in the
inclination toward what is right.
   ``However, god is greater and more powerful than everyone and,
as we have previously said, America would not have been a
superpower if it had not been influential in the world.
   ``In order to remain influential, it must respect the freedom of
peoples and the right of nations to make their own choices. It also
must respect other people's sanctities and feeling.
   ``If you continue to ignore this, then I warn of the
consequences, and I hereby record for history that pursuing this
policy will cause America to fall from its present status and it
will lose many opportunities.
   ``In all circumstances, if your pursue war and blockade, you
will be defeated. And, with the help of God, we will triumph.
   ``God is great. Shame be on the shameless,
   ``Saddam Hussein, on the 30th of Moharram 1411, corresponding to
21st of Auugust, 1990.''

<HEAD>Air Traffic Controller on Anti-AIDS Drug Accepts New FAA Job</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-AIDS Problems, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government air traffic controller who lost
his Dulles Airport job after he began taking an anti-AIDS drug has
accepted a lower-level FAA position in Miami, the controller said
Tuesday.
   Ron Wilkinson said he would continue to pursue an
anti-discrimination complaint against the Federal Aviation
Administration and planned to file a federal court suit alleging
discrimination based on a handicap.
   FAA spokesman Roger Meyers in Miami confirmed that Wilkinson,
29, had been offered a job in the FAA's Miami control center but
said he didn't know whether the job had been accepted.
   The FAA suspended Wilkinson's medical certificate in July 1989
when he told his superiors at Dulles, which serves the Washington
metropolitan area, that he was taking the drug AZT, or zidovudine,
after testing positive for the presence of HIV virus.
   The FAA says that controllers, who have the critical duty of
monitoring and directing aircraft, are to be given less critical
jobs if they take AZT. Wilkinson said he was only offered another
job at Dulles months later, after being put on forced leave.
   He had argued that the FAA should offer him a job in Miami where
he was being treated by a doctor and had a group of people helping
him deal with his exposure to AIDS. Wilkinson said he has none of
the symptoms of AIDS itself and has been healthy since his medical
certificate was lifted.
   A person who tests positive for antibodies to the AIDS virus has
a 20 percent to 30 percent chance of developing AIDS over a
five-year period, according to the federal Centers for Disease
Control.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the body's immune
system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and
infections.
   The FAA has said AZT may impair a controller's ability to keep
track of aircraft.
   Wilkinson, his lawyers and the controllers' union have disputed
that, saying medical evidence shows no serious side effects from
use of the drug.
   Wilkinson said he has accepted a job as an air traffic
assistant, with a salary $4,000 lower than his earnings as a full
controller. In accepting, he said, he retained his right to pursue
the anti-discrimination case. The new job also will deny him an
additional $4,000 in overtime and differential pay, he said.
   The FAA has yet to confirm his employment or set a starting date
for the new job, he said.
   The agency gave him until Aug. 22 to accept or reject the offer,
he said.
   Wilkinson said he has nearly 11 years of federal service,
including eight years as an Air Force controller. He said he would
have qualified as a top-level controller in about a year if his
certificate had not been voided.

   Army 1st Lt. Dominique Allen doesn't
want to wait around her post much longer. She wants to join her
husband of less than two weeks in the Saudi Arabian desert.
   Her husband, Spec. Joseph A. Hudert III, already is stationed
with the 82nd Airborne Corps in the Middle East.
   ``I'll feel better being over there,'' the 24-year-old nurse
said Monday. ``I'll be busy. I'm doing my part for the Army. I
might be able to see him. The chances are slight, but I might.''
   She and her husband, who met in ROTC at Virginia Commonwealth
University, had dated for six years and had planned to marry next
year. But when word came down that both likely would be sent to the
Mideast, they decided to move things up.
   In a speech Monday, President Bush cited the newlyweds as fine
examples of the soldiers participating in Operation Desert Shield.
He said they ``show the true caliber of America and the vital
essence of our mission.''

   Peter Burrell can't say exactly what
motivated him to take his chances and set out from Baghdad across
the Iraqi desert nearly a week after the Kuwait invasion, but his
timing was good.
   ``The borders weren't open one day before, and they weren't open
one day after,'' Burrell said. ``It was the one day that looked the
best.''
   Burrell celebrated his safe return Monday with his wife,
Jeanette, and about 50 friends and schoolchildren.
   Burrell, an engineer for Brisbane-based Johnson Controls
International, had been in the Iraqi capital only about three weeks
when Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   He said he and 35 others from the United States, Great Britain,
Yugoslavia and Germany left Baghdad Aug. 8, heading for the
Jordanian border in cars and buses.
   They found that travel across the Iraqi desert was not
restricted. But Burrell and the others weren't sure until near the
end of the 18-hour desert journey that the border to Jordan would
be open.

   He said he didn't think there was any need yet to go in and
rescue any Americans from Kuwait or Iraq.

   McHale was serving his two-week, annual reserve stint with the
7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade in Twentynine Palms, Calif., when
the infantry brigade received orders to ship out. McHale, 40, an
infantry officer with training in desert warfare, applied to go

   McHale is expected to be in the Middle East for six months, said
his wife, Katherine.
   ``No one who knows Paul is surprised,'' she said. ``He was in a

   McHale, a state House member since 1982, is up for re-election
this November, but is running uncontested.

<TEXT>
   The state Board of Pardon and Paroles on Tuesday
commuted the death sentence of a repentant convict after receiving
pleas for mercy from Mother Teresa, Jesse Jackson and relatives of
the murder victim.
   William Neal Moore's defenders call him a born-again Christian
who has been a positive influence on other prisoners. Moore, 39,
had been scheduled to die Wednesday in Georgia's electric chair,
but won a stay of execution earlier Tuesday from the U.S. Supreme
Court.
   Moore was a depressed 23-year-old soldier from Fort Gordon when
a friend told him about an old man who kept $20,000 cash in his
home, according to evidence in the case. Moore got drunk and
entered the home of 77-year-old Fredger Stapleton. When Stapleton
fired a gun at him, Moore said he panicked and shot back, killing
the man.
   It was the third time the Pardons and Paroles Board had granted
clemency to a Georgia death-row inmate since capital punishment was
reinstated in 1976. In both other cases, a conspirator had been
sentenced to die while the defendant who actually committed the
killing received a life sentence.
   Chairman Wayne Snow Jr. said he believed the board's unanimous
decision was based largely on the fact that Moore, who pleaded
guilty, did not have a jury trial. The board members felt
considerable information about Moore ``might have come out in a
trial of the case,'' Snow said.
   He also noted that members of the victim's family had asked the
board to spare Moore's life. ``That's not something we often see,''
Snow said.
   The parole board heard Monday from Mother Teresa, the Nobel
Peace Prize winner, who called from Calcutta, India, and urged the
panel to ``do what Jesus would do,'' said staff member Marsha
Bailey, who took the call. Jackson, the former Democratic
presidential candidate, wired the board on Saturday to urge
clemency.
   Snow said Moore, under Georgia law, will not be eligible for
parole consideration until he has served 25 years in prison,
meaning Moore will have to wait nine more years.
   Moore has written Stapleton's family members ``a lot of times
from prison, that he's sorry, and that he hopes the family can
forgive him,'' said Loretta Jordan Farmer, Stapleton's great-niece.
``And I can.''
   The petition seeking clemency said the Columbus, Ohio, native
was a good person who joined the Army as a teen-ager, compiled a
spotless record and was weighing a military career when his wife,
his childhood sweetheart, soured on the traveling of Army life and
left him, taking their 2-year-old son.

   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu on
Tuesday shrugged off the idea that President Bush was hurting his
image by vacationing during the Mideast standoff with Iraq.
   Sununu joined the president on a golf outing here to raise funds
for Maine Gov. John McKernan's re-election campaign.
   Bush has gone boating daily and made several trips to the golf
course since coming to Maine Aug. 10 for a 25-day vacation. He has
flown back to the White House twice, met at his oceanfront home
with Jordan's King Hussein and spent hours on the telephone dealing
with the crisis.
   ``I think everybody knows he keeps in touch with what's
happening,'' Sununu said. ``I'd rather have a president that kept
the whole thing in perspective than one who locked himself behind
closed doors and brooded about the whole problem.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, speaking separately with
reporters, said ``the president's in command wherever he is. That's
all that matters.''
   One reporter asked Sununu if he thought Bush ``wouldn't have
this problem if Saddam Hussein played golf?''
   ``He's got one large sandtrap, doesn't he?'' Sununu said with a
laugh.

   The White House on Tuesday rebuffed
an offer from Iraq to negotiate, saying ``the world is united'' in
demanding the unconditional withdrawal of Saddan Hussein's army
from Kuwait.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Western nations are
willing to talk to Iraqi officials about the welfare of their
citizens held in Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``But that's not the same as negotiations over a U.N. demand to
get out,'' said the press secretary. He declined to respond to what
he called the latest ``litany'' of criticism of Bush from Saddam.
   Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, said in Amman, Jordan,
Tuesday that ``we are ready to talk'' and ``put all the cards on
the table'' at a U.N. Security Council meeting. Aziz and Saddam, in
separate statements, warned that the United States would be
defeated and ``humiliated'' if it went to war against Iraq.
   Fitzwater said Iraqi officials have refused to give a U.S.
diplomat in Baghdad access to Americans, and he added, ``At this
point we see very little to talk about when all we get are negative
responses.''
   The White House also announced that Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney, returning from a trip through the tense Middle East, and
Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will
fly to Maine Wednesday to confer with Bush at his oceanfront
vacation home. Among the matters they will discuss are a planned
call-up of military reserves.
   Fitzwater said Bush will not sign before Wednesday the order
calling up reserves to fill in the ranks of doctors, cargo handlers
and other specialists depleted by the massive deployment of U.S.
troops to defend Saudi Arabia.
   The number of reservists to be called was still unspecified. One
administration official said privately the order may be open-ended.
   Chief of Staff John Sununu said it will be a ``very surgical,
specialized call-up.''
   Fitzwater said 18 Americans got out of Kuwait Tuesday but
``there are still 54 Americans missing'' _ 13 in Kuwait and 41 in
Iraq.
   ``It does appear that citizens of all nations are being moved
about in Iraq to unknown destinations,'' he said.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
there were ``credible reports'' that Iraq had forced some
Westerners to industrial installations and said an American in
Kuwait was seized in his home and interned in a hotel.
   Boucher said the reports had not been confirmed, nor was it
known whether Americans were among those taken to plants.
   Saddam has threatened to use Westerners as a human shield to
dissuade the United States from attack. More than 3,000 Americans
are among more than 10,000 foreigners trapped in Iraq and Kuwait.
   The buildup of U.S. forces continued in Saudi Arabia.
   At the Pentagon, Gen. Hansford T. Johnson, the top official
responsible for getting troops and supplies to Saudi Arabia, said
security rules prevented him from disclosing the exact number of
ground troops there or on the way but that ``we've moved in
essence'' the equivalent of a town the size of Jefferson City, Mo.
   Preliminary 1990 census figures put Jefferson City's population
at 35,408.
   An additional 20,000 or so sailors are deployed on warships in
the area.
   Fitzwater spoke with reporters at the Woodlands Country Club in
Falmouth, Maine, while Bush was out golfing at a tournament raising
$200,000 for Maine Gov. John McKernan's re-election drive.
   Fitzwater stressed that it was not the United States alone but
``all nations'' that were demanding Iraq to end its occupation of
Kuwait.
   ``We demand complete and unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait.
That is the position of the United Nations and that's the position
of all nations,'' the spokesman said.
   ``I'm sure all nations are interested in the welfare of their
citizens, interested in talking to Iraq at any point. That's not
the same as negotiations over a U.N. demand to get out,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said Joseph Wilson, the U.S. charge d'affaires in
Baghdad, met with Iraqi officials Monday demanding access to
Americans. His plea was spurned.
   Asked if there could be no talks with Iraq until its tanks are
out of Kuwait, Fitzwater replied, ``The important point here is
that the world is united in demanding that Iraq withdraw from
Kuwait. That has not changed one iota by these comments this
morning.''
   Bush, back from a day of speeches in which he termed the
foreigners in Iraq and Kuwait hostages and attacked Saddam as ``a
man of evil standing against human life itself,'' ignored reporters
Tuesday, saying nothing to them during on an early morning jog and
on the golf course.
   Bush spoke by telephone Tuesday to Thomas Pickering, the U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, and to National Security Adviser
Brent Scowcroft who was back at the White House.
   Fitzwater said U.S. warships were still shadowing several ships
in the Persian Gulf region to make sure none violated the trade
embargo with Iraq. However, he said, one Iraqi tanker was being
allowed to dock in a Yemen port based on assurances from the Yemeni
government that that country would not unload or use Iraqi oil.
   Sununu, also out golfing in McKernan's tournament, defended
Bush's decision to stay in Maine in spite of the crisis.
   ``Everybody knows he keeps in touch with what's happening,''
said Sununu. ``I'd rather have a president who kept the whole thing
in perspective than one who locked himself behind closed doors and
brooded about the problem.''
   The president later attended a memorial service for his uncle,
Dr. John Walker, 81, a retired surgeon and investment banker from
Easton, Md., who died Thursday.

   Saudi and Iraqi pilots are playing
cat-and-mouse games along the border virtually every day, the
commander of a Saudi air base said Tuesday.
   Prince Turki Bin Nasser also confirmed that the Iraqis have
moved mobile missile launchers capable of delivering chemical
weapons into Kuwait.
   In the aerial games, neither side is very close, Turki said.
Normally the Iraqis fly about 40 miles from the border while the
Saudis are about 20 to 30 miles from their border.
   Turki briefed reporters on condition they not identify the
location of the base or the names of Saudi pilots who are working
with American fliers.
   ``There is always this cat-and-mouse thing on the border,''
Turki said. ``They have done it more than once . . . almost every
day.''
   The Saudis are flying 24 hours day in shifts and are often in
American-made F-15 jets. The Iraqi Air Force is equipped with MiGs
and Mirage jets.
   A Saudi pilot said a pilot will ``lock on'' to an Iraqi with his
radar or vice-versa. Pilots know they have a pilot in their sights
when they see a blip on the screen.
   Once an Iraqi pilot knows he's in the sights of a Saudi, ``they
turn and go home,'' said the pilot, speaking on condition he not be
identified.
   The Saudi pilot said his role is defensive, but he would not
hesitate to fire a missile if an Iraqi crossed the border or
appeared to be a threat.
   Asked about London reports in the Jane's Soviet Intelligence
Review that Iraq has moved 36 Scud missile launchers into into
Kuwait, he said President Saddam Hussein of Iraq put missiles in
the seized territory the first week after he invaded Aug. 2.
   ``Any movement into Kuwait is a threat,'' he said.
   The Scud, which Iraq used in its war with Iran in the 1980s, is
a ground-to-ground missile.
   To counter Iraqi missiles, the United States has shipped the
advanced Patriot air defense system to Saudi Arabia.
   The state-of-the-art Patriots are capable of defending against
aircraft and missiles. They have only been deployed in the United
States and West Germany before.

   Coast Guard investigators inspected a
cruise ship Tuesday after two crewmen drowned and five were injured
during a dockside safety drill.
   A cable holding a lifeboat broke during the drill Monday,
dumping 13 crew members of the Regent Sun into the frigid waters of
Skagway Harbor, police said.
   Most were quickly pulled from the water, but divers had to
retrieve the bodies of the drowning victims. Rescuers tried for
more than an hour to revive them on the Skagway dock.
   The two were a 24-year-old Honduran and a 59-year-old Greek.
Police and the ship's owner declined to release their names Tuesday
because relatives had not been notified. One crewman, Juan Matute,
23, remained hospitalized, in stable condition with a head injury.
   The men who died apparently were trapped under the lifeboat when
it fell on top of them, said Jeff Brady, editor and publisher of
the Skagway News. All the crew members were wearing life jackets,
Brady said.
   Ann Burguieres, communications manager for the ship's owner,
Regency Cruises Inc. in New York, said it appeared to be a freak
accident. It was the first fatal accident on the ship, she said.
   The Regent Sun continued to its next port, Juneau, where Coast
Guard officials were conducting their investigation. Juneau is 92
miles south of Skagway in southeastern Alaska's scenic Inside
Passage.
   Burguieres said the Regent Sun already had been scheduled
Tuesday for its quarterly Coast Guard safety inspection. Its safety
equipment is inspected by the crew weekly, she said.
   The Regent Sun is the cruise line's flagship. Built in 1964, it
is 627 feet long and registered in the Bahamas. The crew is mostly
European, Burguieres said.
   The ship operates in the Inside Passage during the summer,
offering seven-day cruises between Vancouver, British Columbia, and
Whittier, southeast of Anchorage. The current cruise originated in
Whittier on Friday, Burguieres said.

   When the two Germanys finally unite,
they will be a mighty nation of 78 million people stretching from
France to Poland.
   The two Germanys were founded in 1949. Their division resulted
from Adolf Hitler's defeat in 1945. East Germany was run by
Stalinist leaders for four decades, while West Germany immediately
adopted a parliamentary democracy system of government.
   West Germans built a prosperous nation from the ashes of World
War II. West Germany has one of the world's most powerful economies
and is known for its excellence in high-technology. Its currency,
the deutsche mark, is king in Europe.
   Over the past two years West Germany has also established itself
as an important player in world politics.
   East Germany was long considered one of the most prosperous
nations in Eastern Europe. But last fall's revolution revealed a
nation that had been weakened by years of Communist mismanagement
and corruption.
   East Germany has major industries, including chemical
production. But many of its industries are on the verge of
collapse, overburdened by antiquated production practices,
crumbling factories, and skyrocketing debts.
   Financial experts say the Germans will expand their economic
might after unification.
   But many problems will have to be overcome, such as soaring
unemployment in what is now East Germany.
   Some experts predict that within 10 years, East Germans will
enjoy the same kind of prosperity as their Western neighbors.
   When the two nations unite, their total area will be roughly the
size of Montana.

<HEAD>U.S. Expects Improved Cooperation With Mexico In Narcotics War</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Drug control cooperation between the United
States and Mexico is expected to improve in the coming year but the
next few months will be critical in dealing with new governments of
Colombia and Peru, the State Department said Tuesday.
   In a midyear update of its annual international narcotics
control strategy report, the department's Bureau of International
Narcotics Matters said it is encouraged by developments in the
fight against cocaine, but the heroin situation gives less reason
for optimism.
   ``With new governments of two of the Andean nations _ Colombia
and Peru _ the coming months will be critical if the hemispheric
commitment to narcotics is to be sustained and tangible progress
made in dismantling trafficking networks and reducing the cocaine
supply,'' the department said.
   It said the outgoing government of Peru declined to sign an
agreement for $35 million in U.S. military aid to assist in
counter-narcotics efforts, but new President Alberto Fujimori ``has
indicated a commitment to continuing the counter-narcotics effort,
as well as a willingness to conclude agreements on military
assistance.''
   It said the Colombian government ``has continued to extradite
major drug traffickers and money launderers to the United States,
an action which Colombian traffickers fear most.''
   ``Given recent decreases in reported cocaine usage in the United
States and reported reductions in emergency room incidents
involving cocaine, these developments in the Andes provide reasons
for encouragement,'' the report said.
   ``The U.S. and Mexico continued to cooperate closely on cocaine
interdiction ... and we expect that cooperation between the U.S.
and Mexico will continue to improve during the coming year,'' the
department said.
   However, the department said, ``The international heroin
situation is not as encouraging as that of cocaine. Overproduction
of opium has kept prices down in the U.S. and Europe and the supply
of heroin is abundant worldwide.''

   Army Pfc. Holly Kittle didn't exactly leave
Hal Weese standing at the altar, but their wedding did have to be
called off.
   Less than 36 hours before their August marriage, Kittle was
ordered back to Fort Campbell, Ky., to prepare to ship out for the
Middle East.
   ``My aunt said it was almost as if the minister had said, `If
there's anyone present who objects to this couple getting married,
speak now or forever hold your peace,' and Uncle Sam stood up and
waved his hand,'' said Weese, an Army specialist fourth class on
leave from Weisbaden, Germany.
   Weese said his fiance, a personnel clerk who celebrated her
first anniversary in the Army last week, hadn't received her orders
by Monday.
   Meanwhile, he was left to cancel the tuxedo rentals, dispose of
the already-baked wedding cake and explain the situation to family
and guests.
   Kittle and Weese, both 19, were sweethearts at Elkins High
School and graduated in 1989. Before returning for the wedding,
they had not seen each other in nine months and had run up phone
bills of more than $700 planning the ceremony.
   The couple was preparing for their wedding rehearsal when the
call came for Kittle to return to her base.
   She could have received a two-day extension if she had presented
a marriage certificate, but neither she nor Weese wanted to do that.
   ``We decided to wait until the event could be a happy one. We've
set numerous dates and something has come up each time to cause
postponement,'' said Weese, who is on leave until next Wednesday.
   Beyond then, it could be six months to a year before he returns
to the United States from Germany.
   ``Until then, we'll just have to grin and bear it,'' he said.

   A Marine who filed for conscientious objector
status last week has been told to prepare for deployment as part of
a U.S. policy he says is unnecessarily ``interventionist.''
   Marine Cpl. Jeff Paterson, stationed at Kaneohe Marine Corps Air
Station, has been told he won't be transferred to a non-deployable
unit, attorney Eric Seitz said Monday. But the attorney planned to
file a lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. District Court to ensure his client
would not be sent to Saudi Arabia.
   Paterson, 22, of Hollister, Calif., said he belongs to La Casa,
a group that objects to U.S. ``interventionist'' policies. He said
he does not want to be a pawn in America's fight for Middle East
oil and profits.
   Paterson, who has seven months remaining in his military
commitment, has been working as a supply clerk. He formerly worked
in the field artillery.
   Military policy prohibits officials from confirming that a
soldier or his or her unit are being deployed. Capt. Leonard Ryan,
a spokesman for the Marine base, said filing for conscientious
object status did not necessarily exempt him from deployment.
   Ryan said, however, that if military officials confirm Paterson
is a conscientious objector, every effort will be made to transfer
him to a non-deployable unit.
   The determination will be made after a series of interviews,
Ryan said. He did not know how long it would take to make a
decision.
   Ryan said Paterson was being charged with unauthorized leave
because he was not on leave when he gave an off-base news
conference last week to announce his plans to resist deployment.

<TEXT>
   Estonia announced Tuesday it would open the first
formal talks on independence with the Kremlin on Thursday, the 51st
anniversary of the Hitler-Stalin pact that led to the annexation of
the Baltics.
   Latvian officials said its negotiations on independence would
begin with Soviet authorities within 10 days. There was no
confirmation from the Kremlin that it would begin talks with either
republic.
   In the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, lawmakers named an
eight-member panel for its talks with the Soviet Union on
independence.
   All three republics have been in the forefront of efforts to win
their independence from the Soviet Union, which forcibly absorbed
them after the 1939 non-aggression pact signed by Nazi Germany and
the Soviet Union.
   The pact, along with secret protocols, placed the three into
Moscow's sphere of influence. It also cleared the way for Germany
to invade Poland about a week later to begin World War II.
   After decades of denials, Soviet officials finally admitted in
August 1989 that a secret deal with Adolf Hilter had deeded control
of the Baltics to the Kremlin.
   Baltic activists have long maintained that the secret agreement
and the republics' annexation by the Soviet Union were illegal.
   Activists plan bonfire demonstrations in all three republics
Thursday to mark the anniversary. Church bells also are to be rung
at the same time throughout the region along the Soviet Union's
western border.
   Endel Lippmaa, the Estonian government minister in charge of
negotiations with the Kremlin, told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview that the republic's five-member delegation
would begin talks with Soviet officials in Moscow on Thursday.
   He said the talks were aimed at full independence for Estonia.
He stressed that Estonia was not interested in remaining in the
Soviet Union in a new confederation or in a new federal government
structure.
   In Moscow, Latvian officials met for more than two hours with
Soviet authorities to discuss independence-related issues.
   Andrejs Krastins, deputy chairman of the republic's parliament,
said the first formal talks between the Kremlin and any of the
three Baltic republics would open Thursday in Moscow.
   ``The talks will be between two equal partners,'' he told a news
conference.
   The Soviet TV program Vremya made no mention of any upcoming
talks or an agreement by Soviet officials to deal with the Latvians
as equals. The official news agency Tass reported the claims by the
Latvian officials, but also did not confirm any commitment by the
Soviet side.
   Latvia also promised to protect non-Latvians on its territory _
mainly Russians _ but also said claimed threats against them had
been exaggerated.
   Lithuania named an eight-member team to negotiate independence
from the Soviet Union. Lithuania declared its independence on March
11, but has agreed to suspend the measure for 100 days once talks
begin.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis made a radio appeal
Tuesday to fight the black market activity that blossomed during a
Kremlin economic blockade imposed in the dispute over independence.
The blockade has since been lifted, but black-market dealing
continues.
   The Baltics weren't the only republics moving toward
independence Tuesday. Armenia's parliament debated a declaration of
independence, but decided to delay a vote until at least Wednesday.

   The Persian Gulf crisis is more than
headlines to those with ties to the world's largest naval base. It
means once again, saying goodbye to husbands and wives, sons and
daughters, neighbors and friends.
   ``These are not just news stories, these are our neighbors,''
said Jack Hornbeck, president of the local Chamber of Commerce. ``I
live in Virginia Beach. Next door and across the street are naval
aviators. A surface warfare officer lives just down the block.
   ``When they deploy, the neighborhood kind of pulls together to
help out the families. We want these people to know we support
them.''
   Deployments are nothing new to the Norfolk area, home to a
variety of military posts, inluding the largest naval base, Norfolk
Naval Station. In the past two weeks, 34,000 have left in ships and
planes as part of the deployment of U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia and
the Persian Gulf.
   Thirty-five ships carrying 28,000 sailors left from the Norfolk
Naval Station and nearby Little Creek Amphibious Base since the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Forty-eight F-15s have flown from Langley
Air Force Base, across the James River from Norfolk.
   But more than 100,000 sailors and nearly 100 ships remain at the
Norfolk Naval Station.
   The deployments came on short notice after Iraqi tanks rolled
into Kuwait on Aug. 2. The aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy had
five days notice. That left little time for anything other than
preparations.
   ``The major challenge for these families was getting ready to
leave,'' Capt. Tom Johnson, Atlantic Fleet chaplain, said Tuesday.
``Now they are seeing the empty piers and the reality of the
separation is setting in.''
   Cmdr. George Keller, director of the Norfolk Navy Family
Services Center said the number of calls for assistance has
increased.
   ``The unknown is the most significant thing. This was on such
short notice and that has raised the level of stress. Deployments
are something the Navy lives with,'' he said.
   Area leaders say the influence of the military on the area goes
beyond the mere numbers. The military brings more than $5.4 billion
to the local economy every year. More than a quarter of the area's
1.3 million people have a direct link to the military.
   ``It's hard to find anybody in any walk of life in this area
that didn't start in the Navy,'' said Donald Smith, a sociologist
at Old Dominion University.
   ``The Navy is very much a part of us ... part of our community.
There is no us or them,'' Norfolk Mayor Joe Leafe said.
   Cathy Stokoe, executive director of the Navy Family Services
Center and a Navy wife for 26 years, said the community's feelings
toward the troops and their families makes life a little easier
when the threat of war is near.
   ``If there is something going on, you couldn't ask for a better
place to be,'' she said.

<HEAD>Lawsuit Challenges NRC Decision on Low-level Waste</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than two dozen groups filed a lawsuit
Tuesday challenging a Nuclear Regulatory Commission decision to
ease controls on the disposal of low-level nuclear wastes.
   The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals here, said the
new policy means unhealthy levels of radiation could be left in the
soil and buildings at closed nuclear power plants and that
radioactive contamination could drift into the ground water at
garbage dumps.
   The lawsuit also alleges that NRC didn't provide for adequate
public participation before issuing the new policy in June.
   ``The NRC's rule trades off people's lives in favor of the
financial interests of the nuclear industry,'' said Joan Claybrook,
president of Public Citizen, one of the environmental groups that
filed the lawsuit.
   The NRC said it would, on a case-by-case basis, deregulate the
disposal of certain low-level atomic wastes from nuclear power
plants, hospitals, laboratories and other facilities if the
radioactive emissions are considered ``below regulatory concern.''
   Under the new policy, such wastes could be disposed of in
conventional landfills. All radioactive wastes under previous NRC
policy automatically must be given special precautions and taken to
designated disposal sites.
   The NRC has argued that many of the low-level wastes now
requiring special treatment emit such a low dosage of radiation
that they don't pose a health concern.
   In addition to Public Citizen, other groups joining the lawsuit
were the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, the Natural Resources
Defense Council, the Nuclear Information and Resource Service and
Physicians for Social Responsibility.

   Trotsky is being honored and called a visionary, and the
restored Trotsky house was inaugurated as a city-run museum.
   Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis said at Monday's ceremonies, ``In
current times, the most profound significance of this house is in
communicating that what happened here should never again happen
again: harassing and taking the life of someone who thinks
differently.''
   ``What Trotsky predicted _ the end of the system that persecuted
him _ is today being achieved,'' said another speaker, political
historian Adolfo Sanchez Vazquez.
   Trotsky died on Aug. 22, 1940, 26 hours after Soviet dictator
Josef Stalin had his political rival murderously assaulted at
Trotsky's home-in-exile in the fashionable Mexico City neighborhood
of Coyoacan.
   The assassin, who struck Trotsky in the skull with a
mountaineer's ice ax after Trotsky returned from a seafood
restaurant, spent 20 years in prison. His identity was a mystery
but he was thought to be a Spaniard, Ramon del Rio Mercader, also
known as Jacques Mornard and Frank Jackson.
   The house, formerly maintained on meager funds donated by
Trotsky's grandson, Esteban Volkow, and members of the Trotskyist
Revolutionary Workers Party, was given a meticulous facelift.
   The city spent more than $230,000 to refurbish it and build the
adjacent Asylum Rights and Public Freedom Institute.
   The institute affirms Mexico's policy of providing political
asylum to exiles, regardless of ideology, officials said at the
ceremony.
   ``It is a transformation of history into an instrument of
rights,'' institute board member Javier Wimer told about 200 people.
   Trotsky and his wife, Natalia Sedova, arrived in Mexico in
January 1937, after Stalin ordered Trotsky's exile and execution.
The two leaders of the 1917 Bolshevik revolution were locked in a
power struggle as the health of Vladimir Lenin, founder of the
Soviet state, waned.
   Camacho said Trotsky's exile in Mexico was an example of this
country's overall international and internal policy _ ``Everyone
was against Trotsky and the president of the republic received him
in Mexico.''
   Mexico has given asylum to the late Shah of Iran, refugees from
the Spanish Civil War and Chilean exiles.
   Edgar Sanchez, spokesman of the Revolutionary Workers Party,
attended the ceremony with more than a dozen party members waving
red and white party flags.
   ``It's very positive what is happening here now,'' he said in an
interview.
   He lauded the government's policy on political asylum but added
that Camacho's presence ``doesn't change the fact that there are
other rights that are not respected by the government of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party.''
   He was referring to the governing party that has dominated
Mexican politics since 1929, often through fraud and intimidation.
   Members of two other Trotskyist groups gave the Soviet Union's
Mexican ambassador a petition with 500 signatures demanding changes
in the way Trotsky's role is taught in the Soviet Union.
   Trotsky traditionally has been vilified in Soviet textbooks as a
traitor to the Communist Party.
   The institute's book collection includes 5,000 volumes by and
about Trotsky and other exiles, museum coordinator Jose Enrique
Ortiz said.
   Harvard University donated a catalog of the complete works of
Trotsky contained in its library.
   The institute's exposition hall opened with works by exiled
Chileans and Spaniards in Mexico. Two wall-sized paintings
depicting Trotsky's assassination dominate the exhibit.
   Volkow, who found Trotsky bleeding to death in his study,
attended the ceremony.
   Museum specialists restored the house and gardens where
Trotsky's ashes are buried, using documents and photos to return it
to its condition at the time of Trotsky's death, Ortiz said.
   The garden reflects Trotsky's passion for collecting the hardy
desert plants that his wife spent much of her time tending, he
added.
   Trotsky's eyeglasses, broken in the attack, are perched on his
writing desk along with documents about World War I and Stalin,
subjects Trotsky was writing about when he was killed.
   Bloodstains from the fatal attack are still in the house. So are
bullet holes in bedroom walls from an earlier assassination attempt.

   An attack by leftist guerrillas in El Salvador
on an army barracks across the street from the presidential
residence raises doubts about the rebels' willingness to negotiate,
the State Department said Tuesday.
   ``The guerrillas should immediately cease these attacks and
negotiate seriously to end the war,'' said the department's deputy
spokesman, Richard Boucher.
   Military sources in San Salvador, the Salvadoran capital, said
one person was killed and five were wounded in Monday night's
battle.
   Army troops backed by helicopter gunships exchanged automatic
rifle fire with the rebels for about 30 minutes. The attackers
withdrew shortly after nightfall.
   The guerrilla attack came as peace talks in neighboring Costa
Rica stalled Monday over rebel demands that the army be abolished
and officers be punished for politically motivated murders.
   ``These actions raise serious questions about FMLN (guerrilla)
willingness to reach a negotiated end to the war,'' Boucher said.
``Rather, the guerrillas appear to be trying to cause a break in
the talks and renewed violence. The guerrillas continue to threaten
a second offensive.''
   More than 73,000 people, the majority of them civilians, have
been killed since the war began in October 1979.

   A Palestinian shouting ``American! American!''
on Tuesday stabbed a tourist outside the Old City of Jerusalem as
anti-U.S. feelings continued running high among Palestinians in
Israeli-occupied territories.
   Police identified the tourist as Paul Ollsen, 28, from South
Africa, and said he was hospitalized in fair condition. The
attacker managed to flee, police said.
   Iraq's President Saddam Hussein _ who the Palestinians view as a
hero _ has offered to withdraw from Kuwait in exchange for an
Israeli withdrawal from the occupied areas and the Golan Heights,
all captured from Arab countries in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Near the occupied West Bank town of Ramallah, two Palestinian
youths armed with wooden clubs injured a Jewish driver in an
apparent political attack, police said. The wounded man, Yair
Sfarani, 48, was taken to a hospital in Israel.
   The attackers, who fled in Sfarani's car, were later spotted in
the West Bank town of Hebron but escaped, police said. They said
the attackers' identities were known and their arrest was expected
soon.
   The attacks came as Palestinians shuttered shops and offices in
a general strike throughout the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the
annexed Arab east Jerusalem.
   The strike was called to commemorate the 1969 arson attack on
the Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam's holiest shrines. The mosque in
the walled Old City was severely damaged in the fire, set by an
Australian Christian tourist who apparently believed it would hurry
the return of the Messiah.
   In Gaza, Israeli soldiers shot and wounded at least 11 Arabs
during stone-throwing clashes in four refugee camps, Arab hospital
officials reported. The military command said it was checking the
reports.
   Also Tuesday, the Interior Ministry said it has banned three
Palestinian activists, including leading PLO supporter Faisal
Husseini, from travel abroad on grounds it would harm Israeli
security.
   Army radio said the Interior Ministry had been given information
by Israeli security agents alleging the activists planned to meet
with groups ``hostile to the state.''
   The radio did not elaborate, but the phrase usually refers to
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The travel bans will prevent the Palestinians from attending a
conference in Geneva next week on non-governmental organizations.

   Seventy-five U.N. staff and dependents
have left the Iraqi capital of Baghdad and the world body intends
to remove the remaining 235 staff and families from Iraq and
Kuwait, U.N. officials said Tuesday.
   A U.N. spokeswoman who briefed reporters declined to call the
move an evacuation, but U.N. diplomats said the staff was being
evacuated for their own safety during the gulf crisis.
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, then declared its annexation.
During the weekend, Iraq ordered all foreign missions in Kuwait to
move their operations to Baghdad by Friday, or the remaining
diplomats would be treated as foreign nationals _ many of whom have
been taken to possible military targets.
   The spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
communications links with Kuwait City were cut and she declined
comment on the Iraqi demand that all foreign missions in Kuwait be
closed.
   The 75 staff members and families worked for the Economic and
Social Commission for West Asia.

<HEAD>Despite Successful Prosecution, People Call For Tougher Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Even though the first test of a new federal
law against drunken flying brought conviction of three airline
pilots, the prosecutor and others are renewing calls to beef up the
law or test pilots for alcohol.
   ``What we need is to provide the traveling public with
aggressive steps to ensure that transportation professionals are
sober and unimpaired,'' Steve Hilton, spokesman for Sen. John
Danforth, R-Mo., said Tuesday. Danforth is co-sponsoring a bill to
require random alcohol testing in safety-related transportation
jobs.
   Barry Sweedler, director of the office of safety recommendations
for the National Transportation Safety Board, said he favors a
``zero tolerance'' level for alcohol in pilots.
   ``There's no place for any alcohol in the cockpit of an airplane
or the bridge of a ship or the cab of a truck or the engine of a
train,'' Sweedler said.
   Former Northwest Airlines pilots Norman Lyle Prouse, Robert
Kirchner and Joseph Balzer admitted drinking the night before their
March 8 flight from Fargo, N.D., to Minneapolis-St. Paul. They
argued that they weren't impaired during the flight, despite
blood-alcohol readings of 0.13 percent, 0.06 percent and 0.08
percent, respectively, two hours after landing.
   A jury deliberated three days before finding the three guilty of
flying under the influence Monday in the first test of a 1986
federal law aimed at cracking down on alcohol and drug use on
commercial transportation.
   To reach a guilty verdict, jurors had to decide the pilots'
performance actually was impaired by drinking. That's because the
law doesn't define drunkenness as a certain percentage of alcohol
in the blood, as do many state drunken-driving laws.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth de la Vega said Congress
should consider making the law tougher by specifying that it is a
felony to fly with blood-alcohol concentrations of 0.04 percent or
more.
   For some pilots, their former colleagues' arrests was all it
took for them to rethink their habits.
   ``I stopped drinking, period,'' Northwest Airlines Capt. Jerry
Wortman said Tuesday. ``I think it made me realize that in this job
or in any job there's no point to it any more.''
   Wortman, a Northwest pilot for the past 23 years, said he was
averaging only one drink a week when the arrests prompted him to
quit.
   The case has prompted a handful of commercial pilots to submit
to an industry-wide alcohol rehabilitation program, said John
Mazor, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association in
Washington. Since the program began in the mid-1970s, about 1,200
pilots have signed up, Mazor said.
   Hilton said it's important to focus on random alcohol testing
legislation to improve detection.
   Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., who heads the Aviation
Subcommittee of the House Public Works and Transportation
Committee, said there is opposition to random alcohol testing on
civil liberties grounds.
   Besides, Oberstar said, aviation experts consider the heavy
drinking by the three former Northwest Airlines pilots an
aberration.
   ``We're not talking about an epidemic, that's for sure,''
Oberstar said.
   According to the NTSB, there have been only 16 airline accidents
since 1983 in which drug or alcohol use by pilots was found to be a
factor. None of involved a crash of a major airline.
   The FAA office in Oklahoma City said it has recorded 126 pilot
revocations and 111 suspensions for drug and alcohol violations in
the past five years. Only 36 of the pilots worked for commercial,
passenger-carrying airlines and 12 of those had their licenses
revoked, including Prouse, Kirchner and Balzer, the FAA said.
   Joann Sloane, an FAA spokeswoman in Washington, said the trial
has heightened awareness of the problem but hasn't prompted changes
in FAA policy.
   Major U.S. airlines aren't planning changes in their alcohol
policies, said Kathleen Henriques, spokeswoman for the Air
Transport Association.
   ``They are continually talking about drinking and flying,'' she
said. ``There hasn't been anything spurred by this incident.''

   Rain was scattered over broad areas of the nation Tuesday, with
flooding in parts of Washington and Indiana, and hot, sticky
weather gripped parts of the South and southern Plains.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended from southern Wisconsin
across south-central New York state into central New England, south
across the eastern half of the Gulf Coast, over parts of Louisiana,
eastern Texas, along the Texas Gulf Coast, southeastern Kansas,
north-central Wyoming, across the northern Pacific Coast into the
Idaho Panhandle.
   Severe thunderstorms were possible over sections of Indiana,
Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,
Mississippi, and Alabama.
   Heavy rain caused extensive flooding during the morning at
Yakima, Wapato, and minor flooding at Selah, Wash., the National
Weather Service reported.
   Heavier rainfall totals included 1.43 inches at Stampede Pass,
Wash., and 1.14 inches at Yakima, Wash.
   Floods were possible over eastern Oregon as well as the
Washington Cascades and eastern Washington state, and there was a
risk of flooding north of the Salmon River in Idaho.
   Record flood levels continued along the Tippecanoe River in
Indiana. The river at Ora was slightly higher than the previous
record flood and there had been little change since late Monday.
The Tippecanoe crested at Monterey on Monday.
   Flood watches were posted for Tuesday into Wednesday over
southeastern Virginia as well as the mountains and western portion
of West Virginia.
   A storm, possibly a tornado touchdown, destroyed a trailer north
of Gulfport, Miss., early Tuesday, the weather service said.
   Montgomery, Ala., only reached 98 Tuesday, ending a seven-day
streak of 100-plus temperatures.
   But unseasonably high temperatures and high humidity continued
over portions of the southern Plains and the Tennessee Valley.
Advisories for heat indices from 105 to 110 degrees Tuesday and
Wednesday were posted for northeastern Texas, Arkansas and
southwestern Tennessee.
   Tuesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 32 at Truckee, Calif.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 52 at
McCall, Idaho, to 102 at Waco, Texas.

   Rebels blacked out much of Peru and set off
bombs in Lima in support of a one-day national strike on Tuesday
called to protest austerity measures announced by the new
government of President Alberto Fujimori.
   Most bus drivers stayed home and many stores and factories were
shuttered in fear of violence during the strike.
   Labor leaders said 80 percent of unionized workers stayed off
the job in Lima and at least 65 percent did so nationwide. Mining
union leaders said 80 percent of Peru's 70,000 miners did not work
Tuesday.
   But business leaders said at least 90 percent of union members
showed up for work.
   Communist and leftist labor organizations called the walkout.
They decided on Monday to shorten the strike to 24 hours instead of
the original two days.
   Guerrillas of the Maoist Shining Path organization called an
``armed strike'' to coincide with the national strike, threatening
to use violence against anyone who goes to work or engages in
business during the stoppage.
   The rebels blew up at least three electrical towers late Monday,
blacking out 80 percent of Lima and most of Peru's southern coast,
an electricity company spokesman said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Officials said power was disrupted as north as Chiclayo, 410
miles from the capital.
   Early Tuesday. rebels firing machine guns from a passing car
killed one policeman and wounded another. The officers were trying
to arrest a guerrilla for spraying graffitti on a factory wall.
   Rebels on Tuesday also exploded bombs in front of the Bayer and
Bata plants outside Lima, destroying factory doorways but causing
no injuries.
   Immediately after causing the blackout Monday night, the rebels
simultaneously exploded two car bombs in the capital, neither of
which caused casualties, police said.
   One blew up in front of an army school in a poor Lima
neighborhood. The other exploded near state mining company offices
in Callao, Lima's port city, knocking down the wall of a nearby
building.
   Rebels also set fires in the shape of the hammer and sickle on
three hills around Lima, police said.
   A smaller rebel group, the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement, joined the call for an armed strike Tuesday.
   Streets in Lima's poor neighborhoods and shantytowns were nearly
deserted Tuesday. In previous armed strikes rebels burned dozens of
vehicles in these areas.
   Bus traffic was more normal in downtown Lima and in upper-class
neighborhoods, where police presence is greater.
   Juan Hurtado Miller, the prime minister who is also minister of
the economy, said Monday the government would stick by its program
despite the workers' complaints.
   ``I will not take even one step back,'' he said.
   ``It's not possible to fix in just 15 days what it took five
years to destroy,'' he added, referring to the administration of
former President Alan Garcia.
   The government announced a severe austerity plan on Aug. 8 to
arrest Peru's 3,000 percent annual inflation and rebuild the
country's devastated economy, in which four of five people lack
steady work.
   The price of a gallon of gasoline jumped from 7 cents to more
than $2 and the cost of many food products tripled and quadrupled.
   The government set a new minimum wage of about $50 a month to
help workers cope with the new prices. Workers' groups want the
minimum raised to $400.
   On Monday, four Shining Path gunmen killed the owner of a Lima
clothing factory and his wife. He apparently refused to pay
protection money, police said.
   Two Shining Path rebels were killed in a gunfight with police in
Callao. The rebels were handing out leaflets calling on people to
heed the armed strike call, police said.
   Almost 20,000 Peruvians have died in political violence in the
10 years since the Shining Path took up arms.
   Officials said the blackout affected large portions of
metropolitan Lima and disrupted power along the coast.
   Shortly after the blackout started, police said they stopped a
group of people from lighting a series of torches placed on a
hillside to form a hammer and sickle, symbols used by the Shining
Path's wing of the Peruvian Communist Party.

   The Bush administration is making contingency
plans to cut back the U.S. Embassy staff in Kuwait but will not
shut its doors despite Iraqi demands, U.S. officials said Tuesday.
   ``Obviously, we need to maintain an essential presence to take
care of American citizens,'' one official told The Associated Press.
   There are about 120 U.S. diplomats in the Iraqi-occupied Persian
Gulf country. Their main concern has been keeping track of the
2,500 or so Americans trapped in the country since the invasion
three weeks ago.
   One of the problems facing administration decision-makers is
whether the American diplomats will be able to leave easily or
safely.
   ``There is no final decision on whether or how many U.S.
diplomats may be withdrawn,'' said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has demanded the closing of
embassies in Kuwait City in retaliation for the worldwide economic
boycott approved by the U.N. Security Council.
   Saddam on Monday warned diplomats in Kuwait to shut their
embassies by Friday and to transfer their missions to Baghdad.
Otherwise, a foreign ministry spokesman said, they ``will be
treated ... as ordinary foreign nationals.''
   The nine West European nations, meeting Tuesday in Paris,
rejected the ultimatum and asserted their intention to remain open.
The decision was announced by Gianni de Michelis, the Italian
foreign minister.
   The U.S. Embassy, headed by Ambassador Nathaniel Howell,
maintains contact with as many Americans in Kuwait as it can reach
by telephone or in person. They are advised of developments and
keep the embassy informed of their own situations.
   More than 500 Americans have left Kuwait during the crisis
despite the embassy's advice that they not risk defying Iraqi
travel restrictions.
   Last week, when Iraq demanded Americans and Britons in Kuwait
gather at hotels, the embassy conveyed the order but gave no
specific advice. A handful of Americans showed up at the hotel,
found no Iraqi authorities there and left the next day.
   Britain and the Soviet Union already have decided to scale down
their diplomatic presence in Kuwait without ceasing operations.
This might provide a pattern for the United States to follow as it
weighs its own decision.
   Earlier Tuesday, the State Department said there were ``credible
reports'' that Iraq has forced some Westerners to go to oil
refineries and other industrial installations and that an American
was seized from his home in Kuwait and detained in a hotel.
   Spokesman Richard Boucher said the reports had not been
confirmed, nor was it known whether Americans were among those
taken to the plants.
   The reports came from a variety of sources, including diplomats
in Iraq, another U.S. official said.
   ``The Westerners were seen around oil refineries, but no one got
close enough to pinpoint whether they included Americans,'' said
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Saddam has threatened to use Westerners as a human shield in the
event of a U.S. military attack. More than 3,000 Americans are
among more than 10,000 foreigners trapped in Iraq and Kuwait.
   President Bush has described the Americans as hostages and said
he would hold Iraq responsible for their safety. Iraq has allowed
only U.S. diplomats to depart, although eight private U.S. citizens
managed Monday to reach Saudi Arabia, Boucher said.
   The 18 U.S. diplomats who left Iraq drove across the border to
Jordan, leaving about 10 members of the U.S. Embassy staff behind,
sufficient to operate, the spokesman said.
   The American seized at his home in Kuwait Monday night was not
identified. Boucher said Iraqi soldiers had forced a man, probably
a Kuwaiti, at gun-point to identify the homes of Westerners. The
American was taken to the Meridien Hotel, where he was reported to
be in good condition.
   Officials are uncertain about the whereabouts of two other
groups of Americans. Thirty-five have not been seen by U.S.
officials since they were taken from the Rashid hotel in Baghdad
last Friday.
   The State Department presumes they are in another hotel, the
Melia Mansour, where British citizens have been interned, but
American diplomats have been prevented from checking, despite daily
requests to the Iraqi foreign ministry.
   Twelve Americans were seized Sunday night from two hotels in
Kuwait City.
   In all, 54 Americans are in Iraqi custody. Included are six
Americans who are being held in the Melia Mansour hotel in Baghdad.
   ``The holding of innocent people against their will for
political gain is wrong and it cannot be condoned,'' Boucher said.
``Iraq is violating the most basic norms of international behavior
by its stated policy of using innocent civilians as a form of
insurance against against international efforts to impose
U.N.-mandated sanctions.
   ``The United States will continue to press Iraq by all means
available to fulfill its obligations for the safety and welfare of
foreign citizens in Kuwait and Iraq by allowing them to leave. The
United States will not negotiate concessions in return for what is
an international obligation on the part of Iraq.''

<HEAD>Iraqi Authorities: Citizens of 7 European Lands Can Leave Kuwait</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraqi authorities told Western ambassadors that
citizens of seven European Community nations will be allowed to
leave Kuwait, an official of the Foreign Ministry's Persian Gulf
crisis unit said early Wednesday.
   The offical listed the countries as Italy, Belgium, Spain,
Denmark, the Netherlands, Ireland and Greece. He said the citizens
would be allowed to leave Kuwait by way of Jordan and Turkey.
   About 120 Italians are in Kuwait. Nothing was said about
foreigners in Iraq, and figures for other nationalities were not
given.
   The official spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of
anonymity after RAI, Italian state television, reported that word
was conveyed to the Italian ambassador in Kuwait.
   He said the ambassador also was told about Dutch citizens,
because Italy represents Dutch interests in Kuwait.
   State TV reported that Premier Giulio Andreotti, who is
vacationing in northern Italy, received the news in an urgent
telephone call from President Francesco Cossiga late Tuesday.
   ``There is wonderful news,'' Andreotti said, according to an RAI
reporter who saw the premier take the call at an art exhibit. ``The
Italians in Kuwait will be able to leave.''
   Andreotti told a reporter he hoped the news is the first sign of
an ease-up by Iraq.
   It was not immediately clear when any of these foreigners would
actually leave the country.
   They were trapped when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has said he would prevent more
than 11,000 Westerners from leaving Iraq and Kuwait until the
United States withdraws from the Persian Gulf and lifts the
maritime quarantine of his country.
   Many of the foreigners already have been reported deployed at
strategic military and industrial points in Iraq to deter assault.

   British and American GIs have been
swapping gear in the Saudi Arabian desert and a pair of Uncle Sam's
finest briefs now adorn the wall of a Royal Air Force office at
Dhahran Air Base.
   The new GI-issue underwear are known to the Brits here as
``shreddies.''
   ``They want our gear and we want theirs,'' said RAF junior
technician John Christie, 23. ``A lot of swapping goes on and we've
even got some underpants from them.''
   Nobody would tell British pool reporters flown to the Persian
Gulf by the Ministry of Defense just how a pair of U.S. briefs
found their way to the wall of RAF Squadron 29's administrative
shack.
   But in the spirit of international cooperation, Cpl. Paul Worts,

   Weapons Technician John Christian, 31, noted ``things have

Association, Ian Bruce of the Glasgow Herald and Simon O'Dwyer

   Iraqi forces in Kuwait must steal
water, food and fuel to survive, British intelligence sources said
Tuesday. They also said the Iraqi threat of chemical warfare is not
as great as first feared.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
120,000 Iraqi soldiers now occupying Kuwait are in far worse shape
than the West first believed _ even President Saddam Hussein's
elite Republican Guard.
   Their logistics system is a ``shambles,'' soldiers are reduced
to stealing water and siphoning gasoline from civilian cars, and
many troops are ``young and shaky,'' the sources said.
   American intelligence now paints a picture of an Iraqi army
whose discipline is breaking down and whose equipment is becoming
increasingly unserviceable in the rigorous desert climate, the
sources said.
   ``There is a danger of giving too much credit to Saddam's
capabilities,'' said Air Vice Marshal Sandy Wilson, commander of
British forces in Saudi Arabia.
   He said he is confident the allied forces now in Saudi Arabia
can repel an Iraqi air attack.
   ``The window of vulnerability which existed in the days
immediately following the invasion of Kuwait has passed. We now
have a very good air defense system in place, and I am sure we can
fulfill our commitments,'' Wilson said.
   The intelligence sources said Iraq would probably have ``a
fairly small chance'' of mounting either a successful chemical or
conventional attack on allied forces.
   Asked if the Iraqis would seize the chance of attack before the
arrival of U.S. tanks by sea in two weeks time, the sources said it
was highly unlikely.
   ``If they did, we would chew them up from the air and could
relatively easily shut off their already stretched supply lines,''
one source said.
   The intelligence sources said the threat of chemical bombardment
by long-range, Soviet-made Scud missiles had been largely nullified
by deployment of Saudi Patriot anti-missile missiles.
   Iraq possessed a very limited amount of deadly nerve gases such
as Sarin and Tabun, the sources said.
   They said Iraq has large quantities of mustard and phosgene gas,
but the effects of these would be ``severely degraded'' in the
115-to 130-degree heat in the potential battle area.
   At Dhahran, the main Saudi air base, parking space has become a
critical problem with more than 240 fighter aircraft from three
nations and scores of transport and helicopter gunships on the
tarmac. A steady stream of U.S. military and chartered civilian
aircraft drone in around the clock as the steady build-up
continues. On average, an aircraft lands every 10 minutes.
   On Tuesday, U.S. C-141 Starlifter transport planes were landing
at Dhahran roughly every quarter of an hour. Some were forced to
sit idling on the taxiway for up to half an hour, awaiting a
takeoff which would vacate a parking bay.
   One U.S. pilot, stepping off a Starlifter after a seven-hour
flight from Madrid, said this was his fourth visit to Dhahran in
four days.
   The Saudi pilots at Dhahran flying British-made Tornado fighters
only received the aircraft weeks ago.
   According to Lt. Col. Yahya Zahrani, 39, commander of the Royal
Saudi Air Force's 29th Squadron: ``We are now operationally fully
ready, and I believe, in the longterm, Saddam will be shown that
his invasion was a mistake.''
   He said his unit and the British Air Force Tornadoes were now
coordinating their efforts and were ``in all but name a joint
force.''
   Morale is high and the 1,000-strong British force gleefully
point out that while they are sleeping in air-conditioned huts,
most of the 60,000 American troops here are bedding down in tents.
   On the main airfield, U.S. air personnel have taken to sleeping
at night beneath their fighter aircraft and helicopter gunships in
an attempt to escape the heat.
   The resolve among the British pilots was best summed up by
Flight Lt. Steve Pittaway, a Tornado navigator with 5 Squadron.
   ``I believe what Churchill said. Britain is indeed a sleeping
lion, and, given a cause and a sense of purpose, such as that which
we have over the invasion of Kuwait, our resolve is absolute,'' he
said.

   The Moslem world's venerated center of
theology, Al-Azhar, and Egypt's highest cleric on Tuesday condemned
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The two also indirectly urged the
execution of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Al-Azhar's Sheik Gad el-Haq Aly Gad-el-Haq and Egypt's Mufti
Mohammed Sayed Tantawi justified the presence of ``foreign'' forces
to defend Saudi Arabia, which many Moslem groups oppose.
   The statements by Egypt's Mufti Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, and
Al-Azhar, the ancient university-mosque and seat of Islamic
learning, were published in early editions of Wednesday's state
dailies.
   Hours earlier, President Hosni Mubarak appealed to Saddam in a
nationally broadcast message to withdraw his forces from Kuwait and
avoid ``a destructive war ... `in the name of Islam, the religion
of peace (and) ... in the name of Arab nationalism.''
   The Moslem cleric's statement was run on Al-Akhbar daily's
frontpage under the headline: ``The Leader of Iraq is Treacherous
and Moslems Have a Duty to Kill Him.''
   However, the text of the comments referred to a tyrant in
general, not specifically Saddam.
   Accusing the Iraqi troops of committing crimes in Kuwait,
al-Azhar's Gad el-Haq quoted a verse from the Koran that said: ``If
the Iraqi leaders continue to the end of the destructive road, the
Arab and Islamic world must react and save themselves from this
tyranny and its armies must encircle the tyrant.''
   Tantawi, too, referred to verses from the Koran, which Moslems
believe are the direct words of God to the Prophet Mohammed,
calling for the execution of a tyrant if he does not redeem.
   ``The Moslems and their leaders should first try and solve a
dispute. If one party is tyrannical to the other and does not
accept reconciliation, the Moslems and their leaders must decide to
kill the tyrant, without any hesitation,'' said Tantawi in
explaining the verses.
   ``However,'' he added, ``if the tyrannical party changes and
resorts to peace, the Moslem leaders must reconcile the two
parties.''
   Islamic leaders have shown varied reactions to Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait. At an Arab League summit earlier this month, 12
of the states agreed to impose sanctions on Baghdad and to help
defend Saudi Arabia against a possible Iraqi threat.
   Islam's holiest shrines, Mecca and Medina, lie in Saudi Arabia.
   Islamic activists in Algeria and Jordan, among others, have
supported Iraq's acts and condemned the deployment of American and
Western vessels and troops in the Gulf region.
   But both clerics justified the presence of non-Arab, non-Moslem
forces.

<HEAD>Army Halts Deactivation of 2nd Armored Division</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The face-off in the Middle East has brought
a reprieve for the 2nd Armored Division, the tank unit that Gen.
George S. Patton led to fame in World War II.
   The Army began deactivating the division at Fort Hood two months
ago because peace seemed assured in Europe and because of looming
cuts in the defense budget.
   But the Pentagon has called the deactivation to a halt and
ordered the division's remaining soldiers, with their M1 Abrams
tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles, to prepare to join Operation
Desert Shield in Saudi Arabia, Fort Hood spokeswoman Liz Crossan
said Monday.
   About 2,300 of the division's 12,000 members have pulled out
since the Army began the deactivation in June, she said.
   ``As the situation in the Middle East develops, the Department
of the Army is going to review the 2nd Armored Division and make a
decision regarding any further deactivation,'' Crossan said.
   The division lost about 500 soldiers in June, 800 in July and
900 last week, she said. The rest were to be deactivated by
September 1991.
   The Army hasn't decided whether the restore the unit to full
force, said Army spokesman Capt. David Roth in Washington.
   The Pentagon says elements of the 2nd Armored Division and the
1st Cavalry Division from Fort Hood will soon join the United
States' massive military response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   The armored division was formed in July 1940 to fight in World
War II.
   Led by Patton, the 2nd Armored was the first allied unit to
enter Belgium, helped win the Battle of the Bulge in the winter of
1944 and was the first American unit to enter Berlin on July 4.
1945. Parts of the division also fought in the Korean War and in
Vietnam.
   Later, Elvis Presley served in the 2nd Armored.
   It moved to central Texas in 1946, when Fort Hood was called
Camp Hood.
   Monday's announcement offered temporary relief to community
leaders worried that the loss of 12,000 soldiers and 30,000
civilians would devastate the region's economy.
   Retired Gen. Robert Shoemaker, a Bell County commissioner and a
board member of the community group Keep Hood Alive and Kicking
Inc., said he was relieved.
   The group failed last week to get a court order halting the
deactivation.
   ``All that KHAKI really wanted was for the Army to look
long-range,'' Shoemaker said.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of foreigners continued to pour
across the border by land and air from Iraq on Tuesday, including
two ex-congressmen who arrived on a flight from Baghdad.
   George Hansen of Idaho and Thomas Kindness of Ohio spent five
days in Iraq with an interpreter on a fact-finding mission under
the auspices of Hansen's Free America Foundation. Both were
Republican representatives in their states.
   Twenty Arab-Americans with dual nationality were among the 8,419
foreigners who arrived by land and air from Iraq on Tuesday, said a
Jordanian immigration official, who could not be named under
standing regulations.
   Hansen and Kindness, who arrived with a planeload of foreigners
on an Iraqi Airways flight, said they would spend the night in
Amman before catching a flight Wednesday for New York.
   Also on the flight were CBS anchorman Dan Rather and a network
crew of eight that was ordered out of Baghdad, Hansen said.
   Five Australian diplomatic staffers also were on the arriving
flight, said airport sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In a telephone interview, Kindness said he and Hansen were
carrying back appeals to President Bush from Iraq's Moslem and
Christian leaders ``to give consideration to the sanctity of the
Arab peninsula, where so many holy treasures are located.''
   Hansen said he and Kindness were examining U.S. policy in the
Middle East but provided few details beyond that. He said they
``went out and tested the water everywhere we could, and we did it
substantially alone, and I guess I can't say that it was
uncomfortable being there.''
   The two tried to find out about Americans who had been stranded
in Baghdad after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait but had only
mixed success, Hansen told The Associated Press.
   ``Some of them apparently had made their way home,'' Hansen
said. ``Others were still in Iraq but had joined, apparently, some
of the others that were also detained there and had been farmed out
as quote, guests, end quote, in the smaller villages around some of
the defense installations and that type of thing.''
   Hansen was a GOP congressman for seven terms. He lost election
in 1984 after being convicted of filing false financial disclosure
statements to Congress.
   In December 1979, Hansen was criticized by the State Department
for visiting Iran twice on an unauthorized one-man mission to
discuss American hostages held in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
   Kindness represented western Ohio for 12 years until 1986, when
he made an unsuccessful bid to oust Sen. John Glenn. He became a
lobbyist in Washington but ran for re-election to Congress, losing
in the Republican primary in May.
   Kindness said their trip, arranged by the Iraqi Embassy in
Washington, stemmed from conversations with ``some Arab-American
friends'' who were concerned about the ``growing tension'' in the
Persian Gulf.
   He said he left Baghdad with a better understanding of the Iraqi
point of view.
   ``Iraq does not want to fight the United States,'' Hansen said.
``I think they understand the problem of doing such a thing. ...
They don't want to make a first-strike effort.''
   Meanwhile, as other foreigners, mainly Arab and Asian nationals,
continued to flood into Jordan overland from Iraq, 346 Soviets and
five Frenchmen caught flights for home shortly after their arrival.
   While the crisis sparked by Iraq's Aug. 2 seizure of Kuwait
deepened, the U.S. Embassy in Amman called on the estimated 3,000
American citizens in Jordan to register with it. The State
Department Monday called for the departure of all U.S. citizens
without essential business.
   Soviet and French nationals reached the Ruweishid border post,
204 miles northeast of Amman, late Monday, according to their
respective embassies. Officials said all had departed by air for
home Tuesday.
   The Soviets had been working in Kuwaiti oilfields, and were the
third Soviet group to leave since the invasion, according to a
Soviet Embassy spokesman.
   A French Embassy spokeswoman said the five French citizens
included the wife of a French diplomat in Baghdad, two other adults
and two children.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has allowed Soviets to leave
freely. The Soviet Union was Saddam's chief arms supplier before
Moscow agreed to cut off weapons shipments after the Kuwait
invasion.
   France was also a major weapons supplier, but the Iraqis have
interned French citizens along with other Westerners.
   A total of 560 French were in Iraq and Kuwait at the time of the
invasion. Officials in Baghdad said Tuesday they would not be
allowed to leave if France joins the U.S. in enforcing a U.N.
embargo against Iraq.
   Jordanian border officials said Egyptians made up most of the
hundreds of foreigners continuing to arrive from Iraq.
   About 20,000 Egyptians who had crossed into Jordan earlier were
gathered at Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba waiting for ferries to
take them home.

<HEAD>Trial Opens for Record Promoter Accused of Cash and Cocaine
Payoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trial began Tuesday for one of the most
successful independent record promoters of the 1980s, who is
accused of supplying cocaine and cash to get records played on
radio stations in Texas and California.
   Joseph Isgro is charged under a 1960 federal law that makes such
``payola'' bribes punishable by one year in prison and a $10,000
fine.
   But authorities hope also to convict him of far more serious
crimes.
   A 57-count indictment handed up in November accuses Isgro, 43,
of Glendale, of racketeering, obstructing justice, tax fraud, mail
fraud, conspiring to distribute cocaine and other charges. The
maximum sentence is 200 years in prison and $1.47 million in fines.
   Also on trial are Raymond Anderson, a former Columbia Records
executive accused of accepting kickbacks from Isgro, and Jeffrey
Monka, accused of setting up a sham company to launder Isgro's
payola payments. Anderson faces up to 20 years in prison and
$13,000 in fines, Monka 23 years and $1.35 million.
   Isgro's company grossed as much as $10 million a year during the
1980s, employing up to 30 people in lavish offices on Sunset
Boulevard as it promoted records for Columbia, Warner Brothers,
RCA, Polygram and other labels.
   As jury selection began Tuesday, Isgro's lawyer, Donald Re,
maintained his client was a legitimate businessman.
   ``The government's case really depends upon the testimony of
about four or five witnesses,'' Re told reporters outside court.
   ``All of them are informants, all of them are bought and paid
for by the government,'' he said. ``I don't think it's the kind of
case a jury will buy.''
   One of those witnesses is Isgro's bodyguard, David Michael
Smith. Court documents say Smith has told investigators he saw
Isgro give cash to Joseph Armone, a convicted heroin dealer
identified by federal authorities as a high-ranking member of New
York's Gambino crime family.
   Two Isgro associates, Ralph Tashjian and William Craig, already
have been convicted of giving payola to radio station directors for
favorable play of their clients' songs.

   A cat locked for more than a month in an
otherwise empty vending machine appears healthy and is up to her
``old loving tricks,'' the owner said.
   Shadow, a $300 blue-point Himalayan, was found in the machine
last week, after 37 days without food or water. She lost about
three pounds during the ordeal but is regaining it rapidly, her
owner, Daresa Hooper, said Monday.
   Shadow spent the night in an animal hospital before returning to
her home here, said Mrs. Hooper.
   ``She's getting better and better every day,'' Mrs. Hooper said.
``She's got her muscle control back, and she didn't have any brain
damage, thank God. She remembers all of us, and she's back to her
old loving tricks.''
   Shadow's ordeal began July 9, when Mrs. Hooper sold six vending
machines to J.R. Hilton, who owns a vending business in Chesapeake,
on the Virginia coast about 30 miles south of here.
   The cat apparently got inside the machine while it was being
worked on, Mrs. Hooper said.
   Mrs. Hooper, her husband, James, and their two children searched
in vain for the pet, but eventually lost hope and got two other
cats.
   On Aug. 14, Hilton opened one of the machines.
   ``When I opened it up, there were two big, blue eyes looking at
me,'' he said. ``After it realized what was going on, it let out
three big yowls like a cat in distress.''
   ``The first day home, she had this worried look on her face like
she couldn't understand why we didn't come get her,'' Mrs. Hooper
said. ``I sat down and cried with her and told her I was sorry. I
think she understood.''

<HEAD>Senator Terry Sanford Calls for Reduction in Gulf Forces</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Terry Sanford, D-N.C., called
Tuesday for a gradual reduction in U.S. forces in the Middle East,
saying the show of force has accomplished its goal of stifling
Iraqi aggression.
   ``We have accomplished our mission of stopping Iraq's drive to
take over Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Middle East,'' Sanford
said in a news release. ``We should begin to reduce our forces in
Saudi Arabia, ever so slowly, and look to a more multinational
force to keep the peace.''
   The call by Sanford, who has a liberal voting record, was the
most outspoken criticism of the U.S. buildup so far from Capitol
Hill.
   Sanford said the United States must put the lives of its
soldiers and the interests of Americans stranded in the Middle East
ahead of worries about Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and its oil
reserves.
   ``Iraq did not violate U.S. rights particularly, and it is not
up to us to rectify their wrongdoing,'' he said. ``Except that we
are part of the United Nations, we have no interest in Kuwait worth
the life of a single serviceman. Certainly I would not risk a
single life to restore the Kuwaiti royal family to the throne.''
   Sanford said President Bush and his advisers may have exposed
Americans in the Middle East to greater danger ``when they
exhibited all that bluster about forcing Iraq to retreat from
Kuwait.''
   ``Seizing foreign nationals is about the only defense Saddam
(Hussein, Iraq's leader) has to discourage invasion, which the U.S.
buildup gives him reason to fear,'' Sanford said.
   The matter is best left to the United Nations and continued
multinational efforts to embargo Iraqi trade, he said.
   Even the embargo should be tempered to avoid hampering food
shipments, Sanford said.
   ``This is not in keeping with the humane practices of civilized
societies,'' he said. ``Cutting off the income Iraq would receive
from the sale of oil will be quite adequate to resolve the matter.''

<TEXT>
   A government report showing a sharp rise in
the number of food stamp recipients reveals a lot more poor people
in the United States than many wish to admit, the chairman of a
congressional committee on hunger said Tuesday.
   ``It shows you to a certain extent the sleeping giant that is
out there,'' said Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, in a statement released
by his office following published reports about an Agriculture
Department study on food stamps.
   He said the findings in the report demonstrate how even a slight
downturn in the economy can be too much for some people, throwing
them onto public assistance rolls.
   The report, a summary of which was furnished by the Agriculture
Department on Tuesday, said the number of people using food stamps
rose by more than 1 million between the second quarter of fiscal
1989 and the second quarter of this fiscal year, pushing the
overall figure to just over 20 million.
   The rise extended to 44 states and the District of Columbia,
varying in size and timing from state to state. Nearly half the
total increase was attributable to a rise in recipients in Texas,
California and Florida, the report said.
   Agriculture Department investigators found no consensus about
the causes of the increases. They said the increases are so recent
that much of the data traditionally used to analyze food stamp
trends are not available.
   However, the study offers several possible reasons for the
increases, including greater unemployment, more working poor,
higher food prices, changes in the distribution of income, more
female heads of household, changes in the immigration laws giving
thousands of aliens legal status and making them eligible for food
stamps and improved accessibility and outreach.
   ``Food stamps are an entitlement,'' said Hall's statement. ``It
doesn't make any sense to create an entitlement program and then
keep it a secret. At some time everyone is going to have to come to
grips with the fact that we have this many poor people.''
   Further studies will be done to improve the food stamp program,
said a committee staff member. Also, hearings on poverty in America
will be held soon by the House Select Committee on Hunger, which
Hall chairs.
   The House earlier this month approved a farm bill that would
expand access to the food assistance program. The House approved
$18.1 billion for fiscal 1991. The Senate has yet to act.
   The Agriculture Department study was undertaken at the request
of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which was concerned about
the recent rise in recipients.
   The Bush administration, anticipating 18.1 million food stamp
recipients this year, requested $13.3 billion for fiscal 1990.
Congress approved $14.8 billion and later provided another $1.2
billion when the initial amount proved to be too low.

   West African soldiers loaded their
equipment on board six ships Tuesday as they prepared to set sail
for Liberia to halt the bloody civil war there. Their orders were
to stand by in the port of beleaguered Monrovia and avoid fighting
during truce negotiations.
   Hours after the troops were scheduled to leave, their ships
remained in the harbor of Freetown. Some soldiers were seen
sleeping on the pavement while others were attending a disco in the
port authority area.
   Hundreds of soldiers from Gambia, Ghana, Nigeria and Sierra
Leone were expected to leave for Liberia on Wednesday.
   Late Tuesday, they were still loading armored cars, tanks and
other military equipment on board their vessels.
   The ships began loading after Liberian rebel leader Charles
Taylor refused to go to a meeting on Tuesday to discuss a
cease-fire with Gambian President Sir Dawda Jawara.
   Taylor had agreed on Monday to attend the meeting. Instead, he
sent three envoys to meet with Jawara, chairman of the Economic
Community of West African States; task force commander Lt. Gen.
Arnold Quainoo of Ghana; and West African foreign ministers.
   Guinean soldiers were traveling overland across their border
with Liberia to join the task force, according to a West African
Community statement issued in the Gambian capital, Banjul.
   This would take the Guineans through hostile territory held by
rebels led by Taylor. He has threatened to attack any foreign
troops that intervene in the 8-month-old conflict in the West
African nation of about 2.5 million people.
   African leaders previously told their soldiers they must fight,
if necessary, to force a cease-fire in the three-sided conflict.
   The rebels are out to oust the government of President Samuel
Doe, which they branded as corrupt. But a rebel faction led by
Prince Johnson broke with Taylor. Rebels now are fighting each
other as well as Doe's forces.
   The Banjul statement said the task force has orders to remain on
standby in the Liberian capital's port and avoid all operations
while mediation efforts to bring about a truce go on.
   West African leaders decided Aug. 6 to intervene in the war.
They said it was no longer an internal conflict because thousands
of their nationals were trapped in Monrovia and because of the
burden on neighboring states of about 400,000 Liberian refugees
from the fighting.
   Guinea already has hundreds of troops stationed on its border
after Taylor's rebels invaded to kill Liberian refugees of the
Mandingo tribe. Mandingos are accused of supporting government
soldiers.
   On Monday, Doe's soldiers and the rival rebel faction under
Johnson, which controls most of Monrovia, announced a truce.
   Johnson has pledged to hold Monrovia's port for the arrival of
the African force, which Doe also has welcomed.
   Fighters from both Doe and Johnson forces told a diplomat in
Monrovia on Monday they were ready to join forces to resist any
attack by Taylor's men.
   Taylor's forces number about 10,000, the largest army in
Liberia, but are mainly ill-trained peasant recruits and boys.
Doe's forces for weeks have held them off four miles east of Doe's
clifftop presidential mansion.
   The rebels invaded Liberia on Dec. 24 invasion from Ivory Coast,
In February, the rebels split into rival factions under Taylor and
Johnson.
   The capital has been under siege since the end of June. Many of
the 400,000 residents have fled or were evacuated. Water supplies,
electricity and telephone communications were cut about eight weeks
ago. Monrovia has been without fresh food supplies for weeks.
   Decomposing bodies lie in the streets. No hospitals are
operating.

<HEAD>Britain's Thatcher Vows Never to Negotiate on Hostages</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher pledged on
Tuesday never to negotiate for the release of hostages held by
Iraq, as government sources confirmed that some Britons have been
moved to military sites.
   She denounced President Saddam Hussein of Iraq for using
innocent Britons and other Westerners as ``human shields,'' saying
this practice ``totally flouted'' fundamental human rights.
   She emphasized British rejection of the Iraqi order that all
embassies in Kuwait be closed by Friday and said the British
Embassy will remain open.
   ``Solidarity is important here. We are fully entitled to keep
our embassy there . . . our people are there and they have a right
to expect the full amount of protection that we can possibly give
them,'' she said.
   Mrs. Thatcher promised that the hostage-taking would not deter
Britain from helping to liberate Kuwait and defend Persian Gulf
states from further Iraqi aggression action. She announced the
government was considering sending additional forces and aircraft
to the region.
   Hours later, senior government sources disclosed for the first
time that some of the 137 Britons rounded up in Kuwait by the
Iraqis had been taken to military sites.
   ``There are some who are in civilian installations but we have
found out today (Tuesday) that there are others at military
installations,'' said one government source, speaking on condition
he was not identified.
   The Foreign Office said Tuesday night the Iraqi military took 10
Britons and one American from homes in Kuwait City to a civilian
establishment in the city where they were ``safe and well.''
   It was the first report of Britons being rounded up from homes.
The Foreign Office said it couldn't confirm a U.S. State Department
report that they were taken at gunpoint.
   It said the whereabouts were known of 97 of the 137 Britons
rounded up in Kuwait.
   The high-level government sources said 76 were at civilian
installations but refused to say if the other 21 were held at
military sites. They did not disclose the location of the military
sites.
   For the first time, Mrs. Thatcher referred to the Britons being
held by Iraq as hostages.
   ``As President Bush pointed out . . . Saddam Hussein is trying
in his tactics to hide behind Western women and children and use
them as human shields and use them as part of his negotiations,''
she told a news conference.
   ``We will never bargain.''
   She accused the International Committee of the Red Cross of
failing to take action to protect foreign nationals in Kuwait and
Iraq. She said it was contacted Aug. 8 and 10, but she was ``deeply
disappointed'' it did nothing.
   Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave met Cornelio
Sommaruga, Swiss president of the ICRC, in Geneva Tuesday and asked
the organization to try to help Britons and other foreigners in
Kuwait and Iraq, the Foreign Office said.
   It said Waldegrave stressed it was clear Iraq breached the 4th
Geneva Convention which protects civilians.
   Waldegrave said Sommaruga shared British government ``anger and
frustration'' and that the ICRC was doing its best to gain access
to the hostages.
   An ICRC spokesman said the meeting was one of a series of
contacts the ICRC had held with several countries since Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Mrs. Thatcher asked other nations to contribute military forces
or funds to show solidarity with the international effort to deter
Iraq and enforce the U.N. embargo against it.
   She said she and President Bush had said from the beginning ``we
do not rule out military force'' but the key was making the
economic sanctions effective to bring pressure on Iraq.
   She said she supported a further U.N. resolution following the
sanctions on Iraq voted by the United Nations Security Council,
adding:
   ``That resolution must have teeth, if it's to be effective.''

<TEXT>
   Jurors in a trial detailing covert Contra supply
operations began deliberating Tuesday whether to compensate a
crewmember of a plane shot down in Nicaragua and the co-pilot's
survivors.
   After five weeks of testimony, U.S. District Judge C. Clyde
Atkins instructed the jury, cautioning them against a verdict based
on sympathy or public opinion.
   Brian Strange, attorney for plaintiff Eugene Hasenfus, told the
jury that the cargo handler and his wife, Sally, should at least be
reimbursed for expenses connected to his legal battle in Nicaragua,
where Hasenfus was captured and held for three months.
   ``They were told their families would be taken care of and then
the defense comes before you and says, ``Not us,' '' said Strange.
   Attorneys for a Miami-based cargo carrier, Southern Air
Transport, and several other defendants in the lawsuit say Hasenfus
and co-pilot Wallace ``Buzz'' Sawyer Jr., who died in the crash,
had no formal contract and knew the risks of the secret flight.
   The jury recessed for the day after 6{ hours, and was to resume
deliberations Wednesday.
   Atkins threw out a major portion of the claims last week. All
that's left for the jury to decide is whether Hasenfus is due back
pay and if Sawyer's family can collect death benefits from retired
Air Force Gen. Richard Secord and Southern Air.
   On Friday, Atkins ruled that jurors cannot consider damages for
mental stress suffered by Hasenfus after the plane was shot down by
Nicaraguan troops in October 1986. The Marinette, Wis., man was the
sole survivor of the crash.
   The judge also removed claims seeking punitive damages and
allegations the aircraft was unsafe.
   Thomas Spencer, an attorney for Secord, said his client did not
have the authority to make a contract with Hasenfus or Sawyer, of
Magnolia, Ark.
   ``My client didn't contribute to the death of Buzz Sawyer or the
harm to Gene Hasenfus,'' said Spencer. ``The White House called him
and asked to help with the re-supply operation.''
   Secord helped former National Security Council aide Oliver North
organize the Contra supply network. He was placed on two years'
probation after pleading guilty to lying to Congress about his role
in the Iran-Contra affair.

   Farmers opposed to imports of
agricultural products shouted insults and hurled bottles at a
Cabinet member, news reports said Tuesday.
   Kang Bo-seong, minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries,
was attending a rally Monday when he was heckled by thousands of
slogan-chanting farmers, the newspaper Dong-A Ilbo said.
   About 15,000 farmers took part in the rally in Chonan in central
South Korea, where Kang was to have explained the government's
position about multinational trade negotiations called the Uruguay
Round, it said.
   Farmers threw bottles and tried to storm the podium when Kang
arrived, forcing him to leave after making a short speech, the
newspaper said. Kang escaped unhurt.
   The farmers demanded that the government stop imports of
agricultural products and reject the Uruguay Round negotiations,
which are sponsored by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
to remove trade restrictions.
   Farmers have staged a series of anti-government protests,
contending that their livelihood has been damaged by imported
products. About 50 farmers have killed themselves in protests over
the government's agricultural policy.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The producer of the hit London musical ``Miss
Saigon'' said Tuesday he would take a $600,000 loss rather than
bring the show to Broadway amid controversy over his casting of a
white man to play a Eurasian pimp.
   But Cameron Mackintosh left the door open for a rapprochement
that could bring the show _ and its $25 million in advance ticket
sales _ to Broadway in April 1991. The show initially was supposed
to begin previews a month earlier.
   ``I cannot in good conscience reschedule the production in the
absence of a positive working environment and an understanding ...
that artistic freedom of choice cannot be compromised,'' Mackintosh
said in a three-page statement released in New York.
   Mackintosh, however, said he was willing to work out differences
with Actors' Equity and that he had sent the union a letter
outlining the problems he felt must be overcome for a U.S.
production. The $600,000 loss is expenses the producer already
incurred preparing to bring the show here.
   Equity's approval of Jonathan Pryce to play the role of the
Eurasian was insufficient evidence that the union had a change of
heart, he said.
   ``Their decision was made solely on the technical basis of Mr.
Pryce's acknowledged star status. As I have repeatedly stated, it
is also essential that the profoundly unpleasant atmosphere
currently surrounding the production be dispelled,'' Mackintosh
said.
   Helene Feldman, a spokeswoman for Equity, said the union would
have no comment until Wednesday. Equity executive secretary Alan
Eisenberg was in a meeting Tuesday afternoon and unavailable to
comment.
   Mackintosh had canceled the $10 million production on Aug. 8
after Actors Equity, which has veto power over a foreign actor's
appearance in the United States, voted against letting Pryce bring
his award-winning role to Broadway.
   Pryce won the Olivier Award, the London equivalent of the Tony,
for his portrayal of the brothel owner in the play. The New York
production had been planned as the most expensive show in Broadway
history; its $25 million in advance ticket sales is a record.
   Equity, after the vote against Pryce, said it could not ``appear
to condone the casting of a Caucasian in the role of a Eurasian.''
But in a special meeting of its 70-member executive council
Thursday, Equity reversed field and approved Pryce.
   The council, which represents its 37,500 members, was swayed by
Mackintosh's demonstration of good intent and his promise to seek
Asian actors for Broadway roles, said Eisenberg.
   Pryce, who won a 1977 Tony for his work in ``Comedians,'' also
was determined to be a ``star'' during the second Equity meeting,
Eisenberg said. Stars from other countries usually receive
automatic Equity approval.
   Asian-American groups had urged Equity to stand firm against
Pryce, citing the dearth of good roles for minority actors.
   ``Miss Saigon'' has a cast of 50, including 34 roles for
minority actors. The Pryce role is the only one in the cast that
has been announced. The musical is a love story about an American
soldier in Vietnam during the final days of the war in 1975.

<TEXT>
   Western European nations agreed Tuesday to increase
pressure on Iraq with a coordinated military response and urged the
Security Council to give Persian Gulf forces more power to help
enforce U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
   The decision by foreign and defense ministers of the nine-member
Western European Union, or WEU, signaled a unified, tougher
European posture toward Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   It was followed by a European Community decision to refuse Iraqi
orders to close embassies in Kuwait and a veiled threat that Iraqi
embassies in Europe could also be shut.
   The WEU plan was a green light for Belgium, the Netherlands and
Italy to send ships already heading through the Mediterranean to
the crisis area. Along with several other nations, they were
awaiting a decision by the ministers before committing naval forces
to the region.
   French Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said Spain and
Greece also announced they would send ships.
   All warships will remain under their national commands.
Coordination will extend to zones of operation, task sharing,
logistical support and exchanges of information, according to a
final communique.
   ``Our exceptional meeting responds itself to a situation which
is exceptional in its gravity and its implications,'' Foreign
Minister Roland Dumas of France said. ``A small country surely, but
a sovereign independent country, would find itself wiped off the
map if international reaction had not been so vigorous and
unanimous.''
   Europe has until now reacted with varied responses, timid in
comparison with the United States.
   Britain and France, both with special interests in the Arab
world, are currently the only WEU members with forces now in the
gulf region.
   The European fleets are composed mainly of minesweepers,
corvettes, frigates and destroyers. France sent an aircraft carrier
and guided missile cruiser in an eight-ship fleet totaling 3,800
sailors.
   West Germany said it would move to change its constitution to
allow the use of military forces outside the European theater,
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd announced.
   But officials added this was likely a long process, and not
possible before joint German elections this year.
   Only Portugal expressed reserves about joining in the
multinational military effort, Dumas said.
   WEU Secretary-General Willem van Eekelen said members agreed in
principle to the use of force to respect the U.N. embargo on Iraq.
   The ministers asked the U.N. Security Council to take ``needed
supplementary measures for the embargo to be effectively in place.''
   A U.S. draft resolution now before the Council calls for
international military action to back up the embargo.
   The WEU warned of ``serious consequences'' should harm come to
foreign nationals trapped in Iraq and Kuwait.
   The WEU was created in 1954 and is the only wholly European
forum for security and defense. Its members _ France, Britain, West
Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal and
Luxembourg _ all belong to the 12-nation European Community.
   The WEU meeting was the first major European gathering to
address the Iraqi invasion. It was followed by a working lunch of
EC foreign ministers to discuss the plight of trapped Westerners
and other issues.
   Italian Foreign Minister Gianni de Michelis said the EC decided
to defy an order by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to close
embassies by Friday ``in order to ensure the protection of our
nationals.''
   He said diplomats were instructed not to forcefully resist
closing of the missions.
   De Michelis said after the EC meeting that any attempt to harm
Westerners would be considered ``the most serious kind of offensive
act against the Community.''
   Italy is current EC president.
   President Francois Mitterrand of France, which called for the
two meetings, said trapped Westerners were ``being held hostage,''
a term the EC declined to use.
   It was the first time France referred to its 560 nationals in
Iraq and Kuwait as hostages.

<DATELINE>ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roy Rogers restaurants has again killed
the most popular television ad it's ever run, after the spot drew
criticism last week from the same group that protested it the first
time around.
   The advertisement features women serving plates of food in a
school cafeteria. The spot, with ``See You in September'' in the
background, encouraged schoolchildren to come eat at Roy Rogers
before they're faced with nine months of cafeteria food.
   The ad first appeared in the summer of 1988 and became ``one of
the highest awareness-level commercials'' in the fast food
industry, said John Merritt, vice president for public relations at
Hardee's Food Systems, the new owner of Roy Rogers.
   But Marriott Business and Food Services Management, which owned
Roy Rogers at the time, also provides food to school systems,
airlines, universities and other customers.
   ``The Institutional Food Workers of America came unglued and
jumped on Marriott with both feet,'' Merritt said.
   The cafeteria ad was revived last week by Roy Rogers' marketing
department in Rockville, Md. But the spot has been axed yet again.
   ``The same people predictably came unglued,'' Merritt said.
   He said Hardee's is not in the cafeteria business, but decided
that the ``See You in September'' ad reflected poorly on the entire
food service business.
   ``(It's) just not becoming to us to be poking fun at them,'' he
said. ``You need to put the shoe on the other foot.''
   Hardees, which bought Roy Rogers from Marriott in January for
$365 million, plans to transform the 648 Roy Rogers restaurants
into Hardee's on a market-by-market basis, with all of them
converted by summer of 1991.

<TEXT>
   Caesars Palace attorneys say they will present
evidence that comedian Rodney Dangerfield has ``severe problems
with cocaine, marijuana and alcohol abuse'' when his lawsuit
against the resort goes to trial.
   An attorney for Dangerfield called the allegations ``a joke.''
   The civil trial is scheduled to begin Monday in U.S. District
Court here.
   Dangerfield and his Paperclip Productions Inc. of New York are
seeking $225,000 in damages from Caesars. The resort has filed a
breach of contract countersuit against its former headliner for
$100,000 plus punitive damages.
   Dangerfield sued the resort because of a March 16, 1988 incident
in which he said he suffered eye damage after being scalded by a
burst of steam when entering a steam room behind the hotel's
showroom.
   In documents filed with the court Monday, the resort's attorney,
Jill R. Cohen, wrote that the steam didn't cause Dangerfield's eye
problems. The brief blames Dangerfield's lifestyle, and his use of
a certain type of eyedrops despite warnings to the contrary.
   The document said one witness will testify that at a party after
the alleged incident, Dangerfield, 64, was ``so intoxicated from
drugs and alcohol that he literally passed out face first in a
plate of food.''
   ``There will be substantial evidence that Mr. Dangerfield has
severe problems with cocaine, marijuana and alcohol abuse, that he
swills vodka by the tumblerful, smokes marijuana from morning to
night and is a regular user of cocaine,'' the trial document stated.
   ``Medical opinion testimony will demonstrate that such abuses
significantly contribute to Mr. Dangerfield's eye conditions,'' the
document said.
   Dangerfield's attorney, Barry Langberg, disputed the allegations.
   ``Rodney has denied them and I have never seen him use drugs,''
Landberg said Tuesday. ``We've heard the allegations of drug use
and malingering before and they are totally contrary to Rodney's
performance record.
   ``Mr. Dangerfield has an excellent history of keeping his
engagements. The only recent performances he has missed have been
the ones at Caesars because their negligence caused his eye
injuries and at Bally's (in Las Vegas) because he wouldn't cross
the picket lines during the musicians strike.''
   Dangerfield filed the lawsuit in 1988, claiming his eyes were
injured so severely that he had to cancel five performances at
Caesars. Dangerfield, who is paid $45,000 per show, according to
court documents, was paid $135,000 for performing three times
during the week-long run.
   The trial brief contends Dangerfield isn't entitled to be paid
for performances he says he missed because of the injury. The
Ceasars' brief alleged he gambled at a competing hotel one night
when he missed a performance. On another night, the document says,
he attended a boxing match at Caesars, sitting in a front row seat
in public view while the resort had to announce he could not
perform because of an injury.

   A 12-year-old female dolphin died
after developing breathing problems in an exhibition tank at the
Living Seas pavilion at Walt Disney World, a Disney spokesman said
Tuesday.
   A necropsy found the dolphin had ``a pre-existing lung condition
that could have been exacerbated by normal play in the underwater
tank,'' said Disney's John Dreyer.
   The dolphin, one of three in the glassed-in tank with other
marine mammals, began having problems late Monday and a
veterinarian was called, Dreyer said. The 8-foot-long, 330-pound
dolphin died early Tuesday.
   The dolphins have been at the pavilion at Epcot Center since it
opened in 1986. They aren't trained to perform, but live in a tank
simulating their natural habitat.
   The necropsy was conducted by veterinarian Bob Stevens, who will
file a report on his findings to the National Marine Fisheries
Service, Dreyer said.

<TEXT>
   Winnie Mandela, wife of black
leader Nelson Mandela, has been named head of the African National
Congress' social welfare operations, the organization said Tuesday.
   In the post, Mrs. Mandela will help with ANC efforts to house
and feed its 20,000 exiles outside South Africa. She also will
assist returning exiles and help with the ``general well-being'' of
ANC members in the country, said ANC spokeswoman Gill Marcus.
   Mrs. Marcus noted that in the 1950s, Mrs. Mandela qualified to
become South Africa's first black woman social worker.
   Her husband served 27 years in prison for his role in the ANC's
military wing. He was released in February and has become the
effective leader of the ANC, the country's largest black opposition
movement.
   Mrs. Mandela, who has never previously held a post in the ANC,
has been involved in repeated controversies in recent years.
   According to court testimony earlier this year, Mrs. Mandela was
accused of taking part in the beating of four youths at her home in
Soweto in December 1988. One of the youths, 14-year-old Stompie
Seipei, was killed following a series of beatings, according to
testimony. Jerry Richardson, one of Mrs. Mandela's bodyguards, was
convicted of the killing and sentenced to death.
   Mrs. Mandela has not been charged.
   She also has made recent public statements contradicting her
husband and other ANC leaders. She said the announced suspension of
the ANC's guerrilla campaign did not necessarily mean ANC violence
would end.
   Her husband had announced the end of the armed struggle.

   Former hostage Frank Reed said Tuesday the 3,000
Americans held in Iraq and Kuwait are in for a long siege but he
does not think they will suffer the deprivation of the 14 Western
hostages in Lebanon.
   ``I'm sure they're nervous and tense,'' Reed said of their
families back home. ``But if we look at this logically, to me there
can be no benefit to Saddam Hussein to harm them. Somehow I think
they're in for a long siege and they're going to sit in the desert
for a long time.''
   Reed, a critic of the Bush administration's refusal to negotiate
with captors of the hostages in Lebanon, said he supports the
president's efforts against Iraq.
   ``As a protector of oil, he is most likely doing the right
thing,'' Reed said.
   He expressed renewed concern for the six Americans and other
Westerners held in Lebanon. He implored they not be forgotten in
the Gulf crisis.
   ``For God's sake we're talking about almost six years that Terry
Anderson and Tom Sutherland have been in captivity,'' he said in an
interview. ``They should be freed. When I left them they were sick.
This is very degenerating, this experience.''
   Anderson, 42, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest held hostage with nearly 5{ years in
captivity. Sutherland, 59, acting dean of agriculture at the
American University of Beirut, has been held for a little over five
years.
   The other American hostages are Joseph Cicippio, 59, acting
comptroller at the American University in Beirut; Edward Tracy, 59,
West Beirut resident; Alann Steen, 51, a communications instructor
at Beirut University College; and Jesse Turner, 42, professor of
mathematics and computer science at Beirut University College.
   Reed, who is jobless and lives in an apartment in suburban
Malden, was the director of the Lebanese International School when
he was kidnapped on Sept. 9, 1986.
   He said the showdown between the United States and Iraq and the
Bush administration's preoccupation with the 3,000 American
hostages in the Gulf further shoved the Lebanon hostages into the
background. From the beginning, they've been lost, he said.
   ``I think they've just been again put on the back burner,'' he
said. ``I wish there was as much concern for them. I saw some
pictures on television this morning of the new hostages lying
around swimming pools. For me that's not hostaging. Hostages to me
is deprivation, cruelty, dehumanization of people.
   ``Hell they aren't chained, they aren't blindfolded, they can
walk around. There wouldn't be any comparison as far as their
treatment. They can see their captives. They know who's got them.
We never could see anybody.''
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said he would have no
comment on Reed's remarks.
   Reed, 57, was released last April 30 after 44 months in
captivity in Lebanon. He said he was chained, blindfolded, badly
beaten, malnourished and poisoned with arsenic. He tried to escape
twice.
   Beaten about the face, ``I had my jaw sticking out an inch below
my face,'' he said. ``I couldn't eat for a month. I had my feet
broken. If I do any prolonged standing or walking, they're very
sore. My nose was broken. The ribs were kicked off the base,
protruding out like you would stick your two fingers through a
T-shirt.''
   The only similarity between the two hostage groups at the
moment, he said, is that those Americans held in Iraq and Kuwait
``have a prospect of endless time as Terry and Tom and the others
are suffering from. Other than that I think they're really POWs'' _
held by a nation rather than by shadowy terrorists.

   Leftist rebels stepped up attacks on
government troops throughout El Salvador on Tuesday as hopes waned
for a cease-fire accord in the latest round of talks aimed at
ending the 10-year-old civil war.
   Guerrillas staged a series of attacks on army positions south
and east of the capital, San Salvador, authorities said.
   The attacks came after rebels used bombs hurled from homemade
catapaults and mortars to attack an army barracks in San Salvador
across the street from President Alfredo Cristiani's residence.
   Eleven people were killed and 12 were wounded in the fighting on
Monday and Tuesday, according to official and civilian sources.
   As the fighting intensified, government and rebel negotiators
became less optimistic that any cease-fire accord would result from
the current round of peace talks being held in San Jose, the Costa
Rican capital,
   ``It could be said that we are stuck ... and I don't believe we
will reach substantial accords by the end of this meeting,'' said
the chief government negotiator, Salvadoran Justice Minister Oscar
Santamaria, before going into Tuesday's negotiating session.
   A rebel negotiator, Dagoberto Gutierrez, said, ``If there is no
government movement toward our proposal, we would say that there
won't be any spectacular accords.''
   Both sides had expressed optimism an agreement might be reached
when the current round of talks began Friday between
representatives of Cristiani's conservative U.S.-backed government
and the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. The
talks are scheduled to conclude Wednesday.
   The talks are the fourth round of negotiations this year aimed
at reaching agreement on a cease-fire by Sept. 15.
   But U.N. mediator Alvaro De Soto said it was unlikely there
would be a cease-fire agreement by then.
   ``Given the dynamics of the negotiation process, it's impossible
to arrive at a negotiated cease-fire agreement before Sept. 15,''
De Soto said.
   But ``that doesn't mean that the negotiations won't continue,''
he said.
   The negotiators have made little progress toward reaching a
compromise on rebel demands for reducing the size of the military
and purging and punishing officers responsible for human rights
abuses.
   Government officials have said discussions on the size of the
army and a purge of officers should come only after a cease-fire.
   Neither side has agreed to suspend military actions during the
negotiations.
   A guerrilla spokesman said the attack on the barracks near
Cristiani's residence was meant to pressure the government into
softening its position in the talks.
   ``This is how we're going to crack the killer government's lack
of will to negotiate,'' said a guerrilla who read a communique
Monday on the local San Salvador radio Sonora.
   In Washington, the State Department said Tuesday that the attack
on the army barracks raises doubts about the rebels' willingness to
negotiate.
   ``The guerrillas should immediately cease these attacks and
negotiate seriously to end the war,'' said the department's deputy
spokesman, Richard Boucher.
   One civilian was killed and five others wounded in Monday
night's battle near the barracks, military sources said. But the
rebels said no one was killed and only four civilians were wounded.
   The rebels expressed regrets that civilians were wounded in the
attack, calling it ``a serious error in operational procedures.''
   ``We have given instructions that measures should be taken so
that these types of incidents should not happen again,'' the rebels
said in a news release issued in Mexico City.
   Army troops backed by helicopter gunships exchanged automatic
rifle fire for about 30 minutes with the rebels before the
attackers withdrew.
   The military sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
none of the rebel rounds hit the barracks, which houses a military
communications unit.
   An official at Cristiani's residence said the president was not
there at the time of the attack and denied radio reports that a
mortar round hit the building.
   On Tuesday, guerrillas attacked army positions in Jucuapan, San
Agustin and Santa Elena in Usulutan province in eastern El
Salvador, military officials reported.
   The heaviest fighting was in Jucuapan, 68 miles southeast of San
Salvador, where six rebels, one national guardsman, and one
civilian were killed, officials said. Three guardsmen and one
civilian were wounded. There were no reports of casualties
elsewhere in the province.
   More than 73,000 people, the majority of them civilians, have
been killed since the civil war began in October 1979.

<HEAD>Rare Operation Leaves Man with Two Hearts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL C. BUELOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rare operation has left a man with two
functioning human hearts and a clean bill of health, the University
of Wisconsin Hospital announced Tuesday.
   Surgeons inserted a human donor heart in William Rammer, 53, of
Kaukauna, during an eight-hour operation July 21 to supplement his
diseased heart, said Dr. Barry Fields, the hospital's chief heart
transplant surgeon.
   Rammer will be able to return to his hobbies and possibly even
work, Fields said.
   Rammer, who was discharged Saturday from the hospital to an
outpatient center and expects to return home next week, attended
the news conference Tuesday.
   ``I can feel the difference in the heartbeat. It seems like I
have a stronger heartbeat,'' Rammer told reporters. ``There's a
twin heart beat and you can feel them overlap once in a while.''
   Rammer, a former vice president at a farm equipment
manufacturer, said he was initially ``a little bit apprehensive''
when doctors discussed the procedure earlier this summer. ``But it
was either live with my old heart ... or try this,'' he said.
   Rammer said he could barely breath or eat and had to severely
limit his movements in the months before the operation. But now, he
plans to resume golfing and bowling.
   In ordinary transplants, doctors remove a patient's failing
heart and replace it with a donor heart.
   But in Rammer's case, doctors opted for a heterotopic or
``piggyback'' transplant in which both a new heart and the ailing
heart function in the patient's chest, Fields said.
   ``It's a tight fit because we're not removing anything,'' the
doctor said. ``They're sort of kissing back to back.''
   Fields said the rare transplant, performed only 17 times in the
world in the last year, is used only when patients over 45 suffer
from high blood pressure in the lungs.
   Such patients cannot withstand a necessary heart and lung
transplant so doctors then choose to insert a healthy donor heart
to supplement the diseased heart, Fields said.
   If the patient's original heart stops functioning, it is not
removed and the patient can still function properly with the donor
heart, Fields said.
   Fields said the procedure was developed in the 1970s but had a
bad success rate, primarily because the body would reject the donor
heart. Now, anti-rejection drugs have made all types of transplants
more successful, he said.
   The U.S. survival rate for the operation is now about 70 percent
after one year and 61 percent after three years, the hospital said.
   Rammer suffered from cardiomyopathy, a disease that destroys the
heart muscle, as well as hypertension in his lungs. After the
operation, his own heart pumped blood to his lungs while the new
heart pumped blood to the rest of the body, doctors said.
   Since then, the new heart has become stronger and also supplies
blood to the lungs, which is a positive sign, Fields said.
   Fields said Rammer's original heart will continue to deteriorate
because of the disease, but at a much slower rate.

<HEAD>Only 30 Members of Nicaraguan Paramilitary Group Give Up Arms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only about 30 members of a right-wing
paramilitary group linked to the now-disbanded Contra rebels
surrendered their weapons on Tuesday to an international commission.
   A commander of the underground group, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said most members planned to keep their weapons because
they expected a Sandinista-led leftist revolt.
   The Organization of American States set up the International
Commission for Support and Verification to help resettle
demobilized Contras and their families, and it normally is not
involved in collecting weapons.
   ``We are making an exception because of an express request from
the government and from the Interior Ministry,'' said the
commission's Sergio Caramagna.
   A representative of Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the
archbishop of Managua, oversaw the arms surrender. The weapons
included hand grenades, explosives and rifles.
   Contra leaders turned in their weapons on June 27 and the
guerrilla force that fought the Sandinistas was officially
disbanded. More than 18,000 Contra rebels were demobilized.
   But the Urban Commandos of the Internal Resistance, a city-based
paramilitary group of Contras, continues to operate underground.
   Thousands of Sandinista supporters are also believed to have
weapons distributed by the Sandinistas just before they handed over
power in April to the U.S.-backed government of President Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro. Her 14-party coalition defeated the
Sandinistas in February elections.
   The Urban Commandos surfaced last month during a Sandinista-led
strike, calling themselves the Brigades of National Salvation. They
appeared on the streets after armed Sandinista supporters began
erecting barricades.
   Six people were killed in violence accompanying the strike, and
Nicaragua appeared on the verge of a new civil war.
   The commando commander said the Urban Commandos had an estimated
350 members in Managua, but not many wanted to surrender their
weapons.
   ``We went around town last night asking others if they also
wanted to disarm, but they told us they felt safer with their
weapons,'' he ``This is a purely voluntary thing.''
   He admitted that the brigades and the Urban Commandos were one
and the same, but ``the brigades have a more civic-sounding name.''
   The commander was unhappy with Mrs. Chamorro for allowing Gen.
Humberto Ortega, a Sandinista and brother of former President
Daniel Ortega, to remain as army chief.
   ``You have to face the fact that it's still a Sandinista army
and a Sandinista police, and we're not going to let them take
things over,'' he said.

   Switzerland is investigating whether
two companies illegally sold Iraq materials that could be used in
making nuclear weapons, the Federal Prosecutor's Office said
Tuesday.
   The office said West German officials, at its request, seized a
shipment enroute to Iraq at the Frankfurt airport two weeks ago.
   A West Berlin newspaper that revealed the case Tuesday,
Tageszeitung, said the intercepted parts were covers and bases for
a gas centrifuge used in enriching uranium for nuclear weapons use.
   The manufacturer, Schmiedemeccanica SA, described the shipment
as half-finished cogs made from a special alloy.
   Its board president, Gianni Martinelli, said the company was not
aware that the $37,000 order had nuclear technology uses.
   Schmiedemeccanica had been under investigation since July on
suspicion of exporting nuclear technology without a license,
prosecutor's office spokesman Roland Hauenstein said.
   He said the office also opened a probe against a Swiss machine
toolmaker with business ties to Iraq, Schaeublin SA, for possible
violation of export laws.
   However, Hauenstein denied Tageszeitung's report that a
Schaeublin shipment also was seized at Frankfurt airport.
   The prosecutor's office and the company declined further comment
on the case.

<TEXT>
   Two Iraqi tankers were docked at Aden on
Tuesday, but it was not immediately clear whether that signaled an
about-face from Yemen's pledge to adhere to anti-Iraq sanctions.
   The official Yemeni news agency quoted an unidentified Foreign
Ministry official as saying Tuesday that Yemen ``does not intend to
intercept or obstruct international navigation in the Red Sea, the
Bab al-Mandab straits, the Gulf of Aden or Arabian Sea.''
   A port official reached by telephone said the Iraqi tankers
Al-Fao and Al-Qadissiyah were docked when he arrived Tuesday
morning.
   The two tankers had been anchored in the Red Sea off Saudi
Arabia, which turned them away last week.
   Another Iraqi tanker that defied a U.S. warship challenge was
reported steaming Tuesday toward Aden.
   Yemen told the U.N. Security Council it would turn away that
tanker, one of two that refused to stop Saturday when U.S. warships
enforcing the U.N. embargo fired warning shots across their bows.
   The ministry spokesman said reports that Yemeni patrol boats
will try to deter Iraqi tankers from putting into port were
incorrect.
   He said Yemen considers that would violate the U.N. charter.
   Yemen could still adhere to U.N. sanctions by ignoring the
tankers and refusing them permission to load. Saudi Arabia used a
similar ploy to turn the tankers away from its ports.
   Diplomatic sources said the two tankers riding at anchor may
have arrived before Yemen announced its intentions at the United
Nations on Monday night.
   Yemen has been gripped by pro-Iraqi and anti-U.S. demonstrations
that included rock-throwing assaults on the U.S. Embassy early in
Persian Gulf crisis.
   An armed forces alert was heightened in Yemen, strategically
located at the southern entrance to the Red Sea, after the United
States began the buildup of the multinational force in neighboring
Saudi Arabia.
   Yemen has generally avoided criticism of Iraq since the crisis
began with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2, and opposed the
dispatch of the multinational force to Saudi Arabia.
   However, Gen. Ali Abdullah Saleh, president since May in the
merged state formed of North and South Yemen, went to Washington
early this year to foster ties with the United States.

   U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson coasted toward an
easy victory in the Republican primary election Tuesday while two
women battled for their party's gubernatorial nomination.
   With returns counted from 13 of the state's 471 precincts, Mary
Mead had 771 votes, or 74 percent, to Nyla Murphy's 272, or 26
percent.
   The victor will challenge incumbent Gov. Mike Sullivan, who
faced only token opposition in the Democratic primary.
   Sullivan received 484 votes in the early returns while his
opponent, Ron ``Suds'' Clingman, a motorcycle repairman, received
just 66 votes.
   Simpson, the Senate minority whip, was easily winning his third
Republican nomination, with 87 percent of the early vote. But it
wasn't immediately clear who his Democratic opponent would be.
   Simpson faced two political unknowns in the GOP primary, while
six unheralded Democrats sought their party's nomination for the
seat.
   The hunt for the GOP gubernatorial nomination pitted Mead, 55,
the daughter of former Gov. and U.S. Sen. Cliff Hansen, against
Murphy, a 59-year-old Casper woman who has served the past 12 years
in the state House of Representatives.
   Mead's campaign stressed her skills as a rancher and
businesswoman and attacked Sullivan's economic development efforts.
   Murphy, in turn, accused Mead of having a negative attitude
toward Wyoming and of failing to propose solutions to the
shortfalls she perceived.
   Sullivan largely ignored the primary campaign and stuck close to
his gubernatorial duties.
   U.S. Rep. Craig Thomas was uncontested in the primary. Elected
last year to fill Dick Cheney's unexpired term in office, Thomas is
seeking his first full-term in the House this fall. Also unopposed
was his Democratic challenger, Pete Maxfield, a University of
Wyoming law professor.

<HEAD>Mitterrand: French Ships could Open Fire on Gulf Ships</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a dramatic toughening of the French stance in
the Persian Gulf, President Francois Mitterrand said Tuesday that
France's warships could open fire on other ships in the region.
   Mitterrand also said at a news conference at the Elysee Palace
that the world had entered a ``war mindset'' toward Iraq that will
be difficult to shed.
   ``An embargo without enforcement would be a mockery,'' he said.
``Should the case arise, the orders to our navy are to board
vessels. As for firing on a ship, only the president of the
republic can order it.''
   Mitterrand's implication that France could engage hostile ships
in battle went beyond comments by a senior naval officer who said
earlier Tuesday that French warships in the gulf could fire warning
shots on shipping to enforce the embargo against Iraq.
   ``But that hasn't happened yet,'' Rear Adm. Pierre Bonnot said
in an interview with the French radio station Antenne-2.
   Last week, French officials shied away from saying the French
navy would take part in ``interdicting'' cargo ships entering or
leaving Iraqi waters.
   But Mitterrand said Tuesday that Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's use of foreigners as human shields at strategic locations
to prevent possible attacks on them had strengthened the world's
resolve.
   ``Without a doubt we are at this time, in the wake of the
responsibility taken by the Iraqi president, in a war mindset,''
Mitterrand said. ``It is a mindset from which it will be difficult
to emerge.''
   Saddam has refused to allow thousands of Westerners, including
about 560 French nationals, to leave Iraq and Kuwait. At least 27
Frenchmen have been forcibly transferred to unknown locations.
   Mitterrand also joined a growing chorus worldwide by calling
French citizens being held in Iraq ``hostages,'' and acknowledged
that efforts to negotiate their freedom had failed.
   It was the first time the French leader had referred to the
French being held in Iraq and Kuwait as hostages.
   ``When you are told that they may be freed in exchange for a
political or military benefit, they are hostages,'' Mitterrand
said. ``There is no need to hide behind semantics.''
   The French National Assembly will convene in an extraordinary
session Aug. 27 to discuss the crisis, Mitterrand said.

<HEAD>Mississippi Ordered To Pay $6.1 Million for Job Referral
Discrimination</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Tuesday ordered
Mississippi to pay more than $6 million to settle a 1970 lawsuit
accusing the state employment agency of systematic racial and sex
discrimination.
   The settlement was the first of its kind in the United States,
said Richard T. Seymour of the Washington, D.C.-based Lawyers'
Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which represented the
plaintiffs.
   ``I'm glad this has come to a closure and hope that employment
services across the country will take this to heart,'' Seymour said.
   U.S. District Judge L.T. Senter Jr. ordered the state to pay
$4.7 million to about 760 former black and female clients of the
employment service's Cleveland office. The state also must pay $1.4
million in attorneys' fees.
   ``This was no surprise,'' said Fred Lotterhos, general counsel
for the state Employment Security Commission. He said there had
been negotiations for the settlement for some time.
   ``We stress the fact this happened a long, long time ago. What
the court found we were doing wrong ... we are not doing that way
anymore,'' Lotterhos said.
   The lawsuit originally was filed in 1970 by Rosie Lee Pegues and
three other blacks. The complaint later was amended to cover more
than 1,500 black or female plaintiffs who applied for assistance
from the agency's Cleveland office.
   A federal appeals court ruled in 1983 that the Cleveland office
was guilty of referring blacks to low-paying domestic and service
jobs while reserving more desirable openings for whites. It also
found that the office discriminated against women by accepting
orders for male-only openings.
   The court ruling covered blacks who sought jobs through the
Cleveland office in 1970 and women who applied for jobs between
1969 and 1973.
   The settlement amount was determined by comparing the salaries
the plaintiffs made and the salaries of jobs they might have had if
they had been referred by the Cleveland office, Lotterhos said.

   The jury that convicted three former pilots
of flying a jetliner while under the influence of alcohol reasoned
they were drunk because they didn't have the sense to heed a
federal inspector's warning not to fly.
   ``If they weren't concerned about the passengers' lives, they
should have at least been thinking about their own careers,'' said
jury forewoman Ruth Boylan.
   The jury deliberated three days before finding the former
Northwest Airlines pilots guilty Monday in the first test of a 1986
federal law aimed at cracking down on alcohol and drug use on
commercial transportation.
   The pilots flew a Boeing 727 with 91 passengers from Fargo,
N.D., to Minneapolis after Federal Aviation Administration
inspector Verle Addison, tipped off to their heavy drinking the
night before, met them at the Fargo departure gate and warned them
not to fly.

   Outspent, out-advertised and trailing in
the polls, Ann Richards says her bid for governor is doing just
fine.
   ``I've really felt up in about the last two weeks,'' the
Democratic nominee said. ``We're running on target, except we've
raised more money than I thought we would.''
   During those last two weeks, her Republican opponent,
oilman-rancher Clayton Williams, has been thrown on the defensive
by news reports questioning his business acumen. And Richards has
pounced on the issue.
   A hard-hitting TV commercial that began airing Friday portrays
multimillionaire Williams as a troubled businessman who misused
employees, is mired in debt and lawsuits and wants to keep it all
secret.

   The blackout on Wall Street has revived a debate
that gains force in these days of electronic trading, high real
estate costs and gripes about the city's infrastructure and
transportation:
   Does the nation's financial market need to be based in New York?
   Some Wall Street executives, angered by delays in restoring
power that caused potential losses in the millions, said New York
is on the verge of an exodus by financial firms that could operate
just about anywhere.
   ``Everyone on the Street is just waiting for one of the major
houses to pull the plug,'' said Daniel Schwartz, managing director
of Ulmer Brothers Inc., a small investment banking firm that
operated out of Schwartz's Brooklyn brownstone home until regaining
power Monday.

   A bust-heads, tell-it-to-the-judge cop survived
two demotions to become police chief in the city with the nation's
highest crime rate.
   Mayor Maynard Jackson appointed Eldrin Bell on Monday,
declaring, ``Eldrin Bell is exactly what the doctor ordered.''
   Despite reservations by some city officials about Bell's alleged
lack of respect for the law, the City Council, meeting minutes
later, dispensed with the usual confirmation process and
unanimously approved the appointment.
   ``We don't need to be messing around,'' said Council President
Marvin S. Arrington. ``We need to put him on the job.''

   A Soviet-made T-55 tank appeared
in downtown Prague today, but instead of the jeers that met Soviet
tanks 22 years ago, Czechoslovaks cheered this piece of armor.
   For the first time, Czechoslovaks were able to observe the
anniversary of the Aug. 21, 1968, Warsaw Pact invasion without fear
of police suppression. The military intervention crushed the Prague
Spring reform movement that tried to introduce Communism with a
human face.
   The Soviet-made tank _ donated by the Czechoslovak army _ bore
the logos of Solidarity, the Polish trade union movement that
helped pave the way for the democratic upheaval in Eastern Europe,
and Civic Forum, President Vaclav Havel's political movement that
guided November's peaceful democratic revolution in Czechoslovakia.
   The tank was tipped onto its side by a crane and will be left in
place through Sept. 6, as Czechoslovaks commemorate the Prague
Spring anniversary.

   Texans soon will be able to see previously secret
documents stemming from legal battles, including those fought over
sensitive environmental and product-liability cases.
   Civil liberties advocates, good-government groups and media
organizations are hailing the state Supreme Court's
first-in-the-nation procedural change, which takes effect Sept. 1.
   ``It's not that we expect, on the first day, a line of people
walking into the courthouse,'' said Jim Harrington, Texas Civil
Liberties Union legal director. ``But the rules will turn the files
there into a public library for our watchdogs.''
   Environmentalists and consumer organizations were particularly
thrilled by the change, adopted in April at the request of the
Legislature. They frequently have won settlements only to have
sealed court records keep information on toxic substances and other
hazards unavailable.

   American ground forces in Saudi Arabia or en
route to the desert kingdom now number at least 35,000, an Air
Force general indicated Tuesday.
   The estimate, while not precise, was the clearest official
indication of the size of the U.S. military buildup, which the Bush
administration says is still growing.
   Gen. Hansford T. Johnson, the top official responsible for
getting GIs and supplies to Saudi Arabia, also told reporters that
the equivalent of 1 billion pounds of military equipment and
soldiers had left U.S. shores by sea or air since Aug. 8.
   Johnson said military security rules prevented him from

   The Persian Gulf crisis is more than
headlines to those with ties to the world's largest naval base. It
means once again, saying goodbye to husbands and wives, sons and
daughters, neighbors and friends.
   ``These are not just news stories, these are our neighbors,''
said Jack Hornbeck, president of the local Chamber of Commerce. ``I
live in Virginia Beach. Next door and across the street are naval
aviators. A surface warfare officer lives just down the block.
   ``When they deploy, the neighborhood kind of pulls together to
help out the families. We want these people to know we support
them.''
   Deployments are nothing new to the Norfolk area, home to a
variety of military posts, inluding the largest naval base, Norfolk
Naval Station. In the past two weeks, 34,000 have left in ships and
planes as part of the deployment of U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia and
the Persian Gulf.

   An ``epidemic of fear and bigotry'' prevents
many rural Americans infected with the AIDS virus from getting
needed care, the National Commission on Aids said in a report
Tuesday.
   The commission also said too few minorities, women and children
are included in experimental-drug testing and that too many
physicians and dentists still won't treat people with AIDS.
   ``We have to do much better to educate everybody to this durable
new threat (of AIDS) in our environment,'' said Dr. June Osborn,
chairwoman of the 15-member commission that advises Congress and
the White House.
   The report was the commission's third, and as with the earlier
two, the panel emphasized the urgency of the situation and called
for ``swift action.''

   Magellan's first radar pictures of Venus
were released Tuesday, showing faults and lava flows like Hawaii
and Idaho and parallel valleys and ridges like those between the
Sierra Nevada and Rockies.
   The large number of fractures and ``Venusquake'' faults seen in
images from the spacecraft suggest the crustal movements that
shaped the landscape are ``perhaps even more violent than I
imagined before,'' said Steve Saunders, Magellan's chief scientist
at Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``Overlapping lava flows of various ages'' and six to 10 miles
wide appear as bright and dark splotches, he said.
   But Saunders said the pictures don't yet show any of Venus'
major volcanoes, whether any of them are active or if the planet's
crust is broken into the kind of drifting plates that carry whole
continents across the face of the Earth. Previous spacecraft
revealed numerous mountainous volcanoes.

   About 100,000 people jammed
Wenceslas Square on Tuesday for the first free commemoration of the
1968 Warsaw Pact invasion and heard their leaders exhort them to
fight the legacy of Communist rule.
   The crowd overflowed the long, narrow square, the site of
confrontations 22 years ago between Soviet tanks and weeping
Czechoslovaks who pelted them with rocks and garbage. The military
intervention crushed the Prague Spring reform movement that tried
to introduce Communism with a human face.
   Just last year, before Czechoslovakia's revolution, riot police
waded into thousands of people who gathered there to recall the
Soviet-led invasion and to demand reform.
   Vaclav Havel, the dissident playwright catapulted to the
presidency by the revolution, cautioned the crowd Tuesday that
reform remains unfinished.

<HEAD>``PrimeTime Live'' Begins Year Two With Hopes, Image Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year ago, ABC began ``PrimeTime Live'' with a
duo some called Fire &amp; Ice _ Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer. Their
first show got more publicity than the first man to go over Niagara
Falls in a beer firkin.
   Part of the hoopla was because the cool Sawyer had recently
joined ABC to do the show with the brash Donaldson, it was summer,
and TV writers hadn't much to write about, said ABC News President
Roone Arledge.
   ``It was such an easy hype that (ABC) people got carried away,''
he wryly admitted as the one-hour newsmagazine series began its
second season of Thursday broadcasts.
   If he could do it all over again, ``I would try to sneak it on
the air,'' he said _ noting that despite all the hoopla, the show
got only a 20 percent share of the audience in its time period when
it premiered.
   But things haven't much improved in the Nielsen department. It
generally has been third in ratings, even last week, when Donaldson
was dispatched to Saudi Arabia for a Persian Gulf crisis report.
   There have been a few changes since last year's premiere.
   Donaldson originally was teamed in a studio here with Sawyer in
hope the live atmosphere might result in crackling chemistry and
snappy patter. The chemistry proved uneasy, the patter often forced.
   With Arledge's blessings, Donaldson now usually does his part of
the show in Washington, to which he returned in May.
   ``How to use Sam and Diane has been an ongoing venture,''
Arledge said. ``And whether this is the proper way or not, we'll
see.''
   But so far, he said, ``It's worked out very well. Sam feels
comfortable in Washington. He has done some of his best work
there,'' and ``it seems to work well. So we're going to keep it for
the time being.''
   The studio audience is no more, save for special occasions. It
was found too intrusive for use on a regular basis, Arledge said.
   And there are more taped reports, although Alredge says all
hands _ they include correspondents Chris Wallace, Judd Rose, and
Jay Schadler _ are on alert for live ``targets of opportunity.''
   But the ``live'' part of the show now usually consists of Sam
and Diane in their respective studios.
   In his frank assessment of what went wrong the first year,
Arledge said that ``somewhere we have an image problem'' caused in
part by too much emphasis on the ``live'' of ``PrimeTime Live.''
   ``Somehow, in the original explanation of the program _ and I
think we have to bear the blame for that _ the idea of liveness was
distorted, so that everything had to be live,'' he said.
   ``That never really was the intention,'' he said. The idea was
to go live only when there was a sound reason to do so, including a
major breaking news story such as the January crash of an Avianca
jetliner here.
   Although he says ``PrimeTime'' is starting to hit its stride and
``I think the program will define itself when people realize it's a
serious program,'' he wishes it were not on ABC's Thursday roster.
   Arledge was not happy when ABC's ``20-20,'' which starts its
12th season this fall, was shifted to Friday from Thursday nights
in 1987.
   As events proved, though, that show did much better in its new
home, averaging a 24 percent share of audience last season,
compared to a 17 percent share in its final season of Thursday
nights.
   But Arledge is not happy that ``PrimeTime'' is on Thursdays
opposite CBS' ``Knots Landing'' and NBC's ``L.A. Law.''
   If he had his druthers, he said, the show would air on Tuesday
nights, where NBC's ``Real Life With Jane Pauley'' specials have
had success. Or even on Wednesday nights.
   Yes, he said, ABC brass are mightily pleased with the show, it's
turning a profit and it's getting better ratings than the
entertainment fare that it replaced a year ago. But ``the idea of
being in the toughest time period on television is not something
that we're happy with,'' he said.

<HEAD>Travanti Would Like to Forget ``That Series'' on the London Stage</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   His fame in ``Hill Street Blues'' may have landed
Daniel J. Travanti a part on the London stage, but he does not like
being reminded of what he calls ``that series.''
   ``I will not say its name, and I will not say that character,''
said Travanti, who played Capt. Frank Furillo in the hit TV series
which ended production in 1987.
   But celebrity, he admits, has its rewards: ``If I had not had
that success, I wouldn't have been asked to do this.''
   As a result, TV's tightly wound precinct captain can be seen
nightly at the Ambassadors Theater sporting an English accent and
aristocratic garb in the long-running play ``Les Liaisons
Dangereuses.''
   Since June 18, he has been portraying the Vicomte de Valmont in
Christopher Hampton's award-winning tale of sexual cunning among
the French haut monde, inspired by Choderlos de Laclos' 1782 novel.
   The play, now in its sixth year, transferred to Broadway in
1987, and inspired the hit 1988 film ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' with
John Malkovich as Valmont.
   ``I'm all trussed up, and I'm pouring sweat,'' Travanti said of
the assignment, in which he is contracted through Sept. 29.
   ``Here I am doing a play that's more demanding than anything
I've ever done, and on top of everything else, I'm fighting a
3{-half minute _ sometimes four-minute _ fight with a 29-year-old,
and I'm 50,'' he said early in the virtually
stream-of-consciousness monologue that constitutes an interview
with him.
   ``It's a good thing I'm this healthy and sober and clear and
have strong legs and all this energy,'' he said, sitting in the
theater auditorium one recent afternoon before a brush-up rehearsal.
   As the actor makes clear, such was not always the case. After a
promising beginning in the theater in regional theaters around the
United States, he took to drink and only faced up to his alcoholism
after suffering a breakdown on tour in the play ``Twigs'' in 1972.
   A 1977 season at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego gave him
renewed confidence, but he had to wait until ``Hill Street'' was
history before he could tackle the stage again.
   ``There was very little chance of (theater) while I was doing
the series,'' he said of a schedule that left him just over three
months off per year. ``There wasn't enough preparation time plus
playing time.''
   The ``Liaisons'' offer came from the British production's
American producer, Frank Gero, who met Travanti 32 years ago in
their home town, Kenosha, Wis.
   ``I said, `Sure I'd consider it; how long and how much?' '' said
Travanti, adding with a laugh that he knew the salary was ``not
going to be much.''
   There were other enticements.
   ``Think of the exotic situation,'' he said. ``How many people
get asked to go to the West End in an exquisite production? We
already know all its strengths. We know there are no flaws to speak
of.''
   Travanti's commitment to a film starting Oct. 8 means he cannot
stay on in London, but he is considering doing a short tour as
Valmont around Europe in 1992.
   The casting has had the desired effect at the London box office.
In a separate interview, Gero told The Associated Press that
grosses increased by almost 25 percent in Travanti's first week.
   The show is now playing to 75 percent to 80 percent capacity,
well above the 54 percent break-even. Travanti's arrival follows a
slack spring during which, Gero said, attendance ``was terrible for
everybody.''
   The star, for his part, hopes to continue working on stage.
   ``Now I've got some opportunities, and so what if I'm 50 years
old?'' Travanti said. ``There's still time; I've got 10 good years
to play the great roles.''
   None of which, he believes, are on television.
   ``I will not do a crime of the week, a social disorder of the
week, or a disease of the week,'' said Travanti, ``and there is
almost nothing else to choose from.
   ``They talk about an important American miniseries, and I say,
`Read my lips. Let me explain something to you. There is no such
thing as an important American miniseries.' ''
   ``There never has been,'' he said. ``And you can quote me on
that.''

   At a Faith No More show, there might be a
few disgruntled faces amid the long hair and tattoos.
   Why? Because one of the band's favorite concert songs is its
note-for-note version of the Commodores' easy-listening classic,
``Easy.''
   You read that right _ the Commodores. But it's all part of the
band's delight in making people a little angry at the same time
it's trying to give them what they want, like a blistering cover of
Black Sabbath's ``War Pigs.''
   ``We just started doing it (`Easy') like two weeks ago,''
bassist Bill Gould said in a telephone interview. ``When we started
doing `War Pigs,' we started doing it about three or four years ago
and we were kind of like an underground band, a punk band, and it
was very uncool to play Black Sabbath.
   ``And that's kind of why we did it. It became like a standard.
So now when we play it, people start going, `War Pigs,' `War Pigs.'
The rock guys want to hear it. So it's about time to pull out the
Commodores,'' he said with a laugh.
   The California-based band is an amalgam of styles tied together
with a base of brutal guitar. Their second album on Slash-Reprise
Records, ``The Real Thing,'' combines rap, funk, jazz and punk.
   The band's main objective is to challenge itself, to make itself
happy _ the rest is up to the listener.
   ``Sometimes the music kind of turns people off on the first
couple listens, because it's kind of strange,'' Gould said.
``That's just the way it is, the way it comes out. This is the way
we write music. We can't help it. It sounds like regular music to
us.''
   And that music is almost agonizingly catchy. Both ``Epic,''
which now sits in Billboard's Top 20, and ``Falling to Pieces''
incorporate the prerequisite heavy guitar sound, but the lyrics are
spoken as in rap, not sung. And they have hooks that just won't let
go.
   Their lyrics pull no punches, either. Faith No More sings of
life rooted in obsession and colored in shades of gray. But Gould
didn't see obsessions as being completely negative.
   ``I think obsessions are a . . . lot of fun,'' he said.
``They're something to do, right? As long as you realize they're
obsessions, I think they're great things to indulge in, as long as
you can take 'em or leave 'em.''
   The band also likes to deal with keeping things in balance, not
emphasizing one thing over another. Gould likened that idea to a
marriage, which is built, as he said, on convention and one's own
perception of reality.
   ``You have to understand that it's a convention and has no basis
in reality except the reality you impose on it,'' he said. ``Most
people, when they get about 45 or 50 years old, realize that they
were married to somebody and they were just cohabitating with them
and that was it and they've spent their whole lives doing it.
   ``You have to understand that there is no real rule. . . . You
have to realize that anything is subject to change.''
   Faith No More was formed in 1982 by Gould, guitarist Jim Martin,
keyboardist Roddy Bottum, drummer Mike Bordin and original vocalist
Chuck Mosely. Their debut album on the independent Mordam Records
label came out in 1986, and the track, ``We Care a Lot,'' received
widespread college radio airplay.
   That song was included on the band's first release on Slash,
``Introduce Yourself,'' in 1987, which also found a home on college
radio, and the band played before packed houses here and abroad.
   Mosely left the band in 1988 and was replaced by 21-year-old
vocalist Mike Patton, late of the San Francisco funk band Mr.
Bungle. The baby-faced singer has a voice that can go from a croon
to a snarl to a wail, sometimes in the same song.
   Gould saw Patton's voice as not a separate entity, but as
another instrument, which to him explained the band's use of rapped
lyrics.
   ``None of it's just to be rapping, but because we play a lot of
counterrhythms, the voice can be used as another instrument, like a
drum on top of the other drums, and he just happens to be
singing,'' he said.
   Their music has been called ``intelligent metal'' by some, but
Gould doesn't think intellectualism plays a role. ``It's more like
being honest about things, trying to put a little sense of reality
into something.
   ``We knew what we were doing was pretty good and it's real
gratifying that it's finally being recognized,'' he said.

   Still glowing from a hot though non-record
summer, the movie business enters the fall season with something a
little different from the high-budget, body-count films that
dominated the past three months.
   The warm-weather box office produced some big numbers, with
``Die Hard 2,'' ``Total Recall,'' ``Dick Tracy'' and ``Ghost''
passing the $100 million mark. Daily Variety's Art Murphy
calculates the 1990 summer is only 6 percent short of last year's
sizzler, which amassed a record $719 million.
   The surprises this year were a pair of romantic fantasies,
``Pretty Woman'' ($170 million) and ``Ghost'' (climbing to $100
million in only five weeks). Hollywood is hoping for more offbeat
hits in the fall product, which leans heavily on comedy and drama
and less on violence.
   There are a few promising films among the fall harvest:
   _ ``Postcards From the Edge,'' Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine
as mother and daughter in Carrie Fisher's novel, directed by Mike
Nichols.
   _ ``Awakenings,'' Penny Marshall (``Big'') directing Robert De
Niro and Robin Williams as amnesia victim and doctor.
   _ ``Goodfellas,'' a Mafia yarn based on the book ``Wise Guy,''
Robert De Niro and Ray Liota directed by Martin Scorsese.
   _ ``White Hunter, Black Heart,'' Clint Eastwood directs himself
in a script based on John Huston's adventures during the filming of
``The African Queen.''
   _ ``Pacific Heights,'' a thriller with Michael Keaton as a
presumably friendly neighbor to a couple, Melanie Griffith and
Matthew Modine.
   _ ``The Rescuers Down Under,'' a new Disney animated feature and
the first sequel; Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor repeat their voicing of
special mouse agents Bernard and Miss Bianca.
   _ ``Dances With Wolves,'' Kevin Costner starring and directing
an epic of Western America.
   _ ``Rocky V: The Final Bell,'' with Rocky Balboa managing
another fighter this time.
   If the fall season seems a bit serious, that's because the
studios trot out the dramas that might get lost in the summer and,
not coincidentally, that might contain potentials for Academy
Awards.
   Some of the more prestigious offerings include:
   _ ``Akira Kurosawa's Dreams,'' an interpretation of the great
director's dreams with a mostly Japanese cast and Scorsese as
Vincent van Gogh.
   _ ``Desperate Hours,'' a remake of the Humphrey Bogart-Fredric
March thriller with Mickey Rourke and Anthony Hopkins directed by
Michael Cimino (``The Deer Hunter,'' ``Heaven's Gate'').
   _ ``Reversal of Fortune,'' the Claus von Bulow story starring
Glenn Close, Jeremy Irons and Ron Silver.
   _ ``Avalon,'' Barry Levinson (``Rain Man'') continues his
trilogy of Baltimore life that includes ``Diner'' and ``Tin Men.''
   _ ``Texasville,'' Peter Bogdanovich's return to ``The Last
Picture Show'' with most of the original cast.
   _ ``White Palace,'' Susan Sarandon and James Spader involved in
a mismatched sexual adventure.
   _ ``State of Grace,'' Sean Penn returns to his childhood haunts
in New York's Hell's Kitchen.
   _ ``Miller's Crossing,'' the offbeat Coen brothers (``Raising
Arizona'') return with a mob-oriented drama starring Gabriel Byrne
and Albert Finney.
   Comedies will also play a major role in the fall season.
   ``Alice'' is Woody Allen's return to comedy, with a cast
including Mia Farrow, William Hurt, Cybill Shepherd and Alec
Baldwin.
   ``Sibling Rivalry'' stars Kirstie Alley, Bill Pullman and Carrie
Fisher in a family comedy directed by Carl Reiner.
   Leonard Nimoy directs Gene Wilder and Christine Lahti in an
ironic love story in ``Funny About Love.''
   Action-adventure isn't being neglected, though the offerings
lack the $50 million-plus budgets and high-tech gimmickry of summer
films.
   A sampling:
   _ ``Marked for Death,'' Steven Seagal fights the drug lords.
   _ ``Quigley Down Under,'' Tom Selleck in Australia.
   _ ``Memphis Belle,'' Mathew Modine and John Lithgow in the World
War II air war.
   _ ``Narrow Margin,'' Gene Hackman and Anne Archer fleeing by
train from mob hitmen.
   _ ``Steven King's Graveyard Shift,'' another offering from the
fright king.
   _ ``Misery,'' Rob Reiner directs James Caan in King's story of a
best-selling author captured by a fan.
   _ ``Night of the Living Dead,'' an update of George A. Romero's
1968 ``classic.''
   _ ``Child's Play II,'' the psychopathic killer doll Chucky
returns.
   If none of the above catch fire, theater owners can look forward
to one of the most promising holiday season in years. The potential
gems include ``The Godfather III,'' ``Three Men and a Little
Lady,'' ``Bonfire of the Vanities,'' ``Edward Scissorhands,''
``Come See the Paradise'' and ``Look Who's Talking Too.''
   The standout could well be ``Scenes From a Mall,'' the first
film since 1976's ``The Front'' in which Woody Allen has acted but
not directed. The movie, co-written and directed by Paul Mazursky
(``Enemies: A Love Story''), co-stars Bette Midler.

   Craftsmen are putting the finishing touches
on a dream, spanning generations, of a restored Mormon mecca on the
Mississippi.
   Completion of a log cabin and post office by Oct. 1 will cap the
extraordinary rebirth of a city known in its heyday as ``Nauvoo the
Beautiful'' _ the center of the Mormon world for seven years in the
mid-19th century.
   The Mormons have spent more than $15 million over 28 years to
restore more than two dozen homes and shops, and to build two
visitor centers and a 700-acre farm dotted with 330 head of cattle.
   ``People come here because it's a historical setting,'' said
Elder Loren C. Dunn, president of Nauvoo Restoration Inc. ``By
telling the story of Nauvoo, we are also telling the story of the
church. The people are coming in through the historical door.''
   From 1839 to 1846, the swampland below a bend in the Mississippi
River some 80 miles upstream from Hannibal, Mo., was transformed
into a bustling city of 12,000. Mormons fleeing mob violence in
Missouri and converts arriving from Great Britain were among the
newcomers.
   A rival of Chicago as the most populous Illinois city, Nauvoo
was where church founder Joseph Smith's vision of a theocracy
achieved its fullest flowering. But just as before in Missouri,
political, economic and religious differences with non-Mormon
neighbors degenerated into armed conflict.
   Less than two years after Smith was slain by a mob in nearby
Carthage in 1844, the ``City of Joseph'' stood a virtual shell. The
Mormons under Brigham Young made their pioneering exodus to the
Great Basin.
   The Mormons didn't forget Nauvoo. Decades after having left in
sorrow, pilgrims returned seeking a sense of their past. One,
making the trip after 78 years, put his thoughts to verse:
   ``In '46 I left Nauvoo
   ``Behind an old oxen team.
   ``Now I'm going back in a Henry Ford,
   ``To see how it will seem.''
   J. Leroy Kimball, a Salt Lake City physician whose patients
included several top officials of the Mormon Church, believed
Nauvoo could be reborn. Kimball's powers of persuasion were a match
for his healing skills.
   ``When you're there in a doctor's office with your clothes off,
you're kind of forced to listen,'' recalls his son, James L.
Kimball. ``Dad really pushed the idea that something should be
done.''
   Several of his captive listeners journeyed to Nauvoo in 1960 to
see the home of Heber C. Kimball, a Smith associate and Kimball's
great-grandfather. The doctor had purchased the house in 1954 and
restored it. Kimball and others who had bought homes or property
were prepared to donate them to the church.
   Mindful that any large-scale Mormon effort would drive up land
values and inflame anti-Mormon sentiments, church leaders in 1962
established the non-profit corporation to do the restoration.
   The church's 1,250 acres of old Nauvoo includes 23 restored
homes and shops. The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-Day Saints, which split with the Mormons after the Nauvoo
period, has restored another 44-acre section that includes Joseph
Smith's residence and grave site.
   The pastoral serenity, hard by the big river and down a verdant
hill from the modern town of 1,100 inhabitants, verges on the
mythic. A scholar of the city's story calls it ``a dreamscape,
almost,'' a Nauvoo of the imagination. Locals boast that it is
``the Colonial Williamsburg of the Midwest.''
   That's the problem, historians grouse.
   Although the project was carefully researched by archaeologists,
architects and historians, it has drawn criticism from scholars who
say its well-manicured grounds and brick structures bear little
resemblance to the original.
   ``People who go to Nauvoo and think they have seen the real
Nauvoo are sadly mistaken,'' said Robert Bruce Flanders, a
Southwest Missouri State historian of the town. ``It's true of
Nauvoo as of Williamsburg. It really doesn't look anything like
Nauvoo did in 1845.''
   Still, Flanders gives the church high marks for its restoration
of individual buildings like Brigham Young's home and is unaware of
any site where ``there is so little development overlaying an old
settlement.''
   Dunn has heard the criticisms and tries to put them in
perspective. ``There are not any two historians that will agree
what Nauvoo was really like,'' he said, ``and we've tried to
restore it to the best of our ability.''
   Dunn points out that the brick structures were the ones that
survived in the best condition and, once restored, are far less
expensive to maintain.
   Still, sensitive to the preponderance of brick, Nauvoo
Restoration is erecting an authentic log cabin. And a detailed
model and film in the visitor center seek to correct any false
impression about what's outside.
   ``It's too clean and too beautiful and you are seeing it at its
Sunday best,'' concedes Kimball's son, who is senior librarian for
the church's historical department. ``But I think the Saints who
left Nauvoo carried in their minds the vision of what it could have
been, or will be again.''

<HEAD>One Town's Love Affair With Plastics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WINONA, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plastics.
   In the 1960s movie ``The Graduate,'' it was the one word of
advice imparted to Benjamin at his graduation party.
   Updated to the '90s in Winona, it still rings true as a sign of
the times _ albeit a lot less cynically.
   The Mississippi River town is acknowledged as one of the
birthplaces of space-age plastics. Its long-running love affair
with the industry has produced a storybook tale of big-time success
in a small town.
   Winona companies have manufactured materials used to make
heat-resistant parts for the B-2 stealth bomber, solid rocket
booster exhaust cones on U.S. space shuttles, airplane doors, body
panels for Grand Prix cars, racing kayaks, automobile bumpers and
graphite fishing rods.
   ``We're not the hub, like some people say, but we are certainly
one of the spokes,'' said Stan Prosen, a consultant in Winona known
as an industry godfather for his work in 1963 on a carbon
fiber-laced `O' ring used to develop the Polaris missile.
   ``We do have a subset of the technology here that is
spectacular,'' said Richard Enochs of ICI Fiberite, the nation's
largest manufacturer of materials for advanced ``composites'' _ the
industry's term for high-tech plastics.
   Unlike mere thermoplastics, composites are a mix of stiff fibers
woven or otherwise combined with resins. They can be as strong as
steel and lighter than aluminum.
   ``They are industrial pioneers in this industry,'' said Dennis
Nielsen, chairman of the engineering department at Winona State
University.
   Inspired by the success, Nielsen has helped to open the nation's
first undergraduate degree program in composite materials
engineering with the help this year of $10.4 million in state money
to build an on-campus home for the program.
   ``We're recruiting heavily from Southern California (the
industry's heartland),'' Nielsen said. ``It gives us national
identity and that's hard to find in academia.''
   Winona got its start in advanced composites in 1948, when Rudy
and Ben Miller founded Fiberite and joined the U.S.-Soviet space
race. Fiberite contributed rocket components light enough for
launching and strong enough to withstand hellish temperatures.
   Unlike regular plastics, composites can be tough and stiff
without being flimsy or brittle. They resist corrosion, cut noise,
absorb impact, and enable the B-2 stealth bomber to duck radar
detection.
   The composites industry directly accounts for about 1,000 of the
20,000 jobs in Winona, said Judith Bodway, local economic
development director. To stimulate even more activity, the city is
seeking $584,000 in state money to fund the fledgling Advanced
Composites Manufacturing Center, she said.
   ``We know that composites have a huge future,'' Bodway said.
   The Office of Technology Assessment for the U.S. Congress
estimates that sales of advanced composite components produced in
the United States will soar from $2 billion in 1989 to $20 billion
at the turn of the century.
   Enochs said Winona is expected to share in that gain even if
defense spending slows down. Production is shifting to auto making,
electronics, construction, commercial aviation, recreation and
other sectors.
   The biggest hurdle is automation, Enochs said. The expense of
composites will continue to prohibit new uses until tools are
developed for mass production.
   ``It's just a question of time,'' Enochs said. ``There is no
question that these industries continue to be driven by the
properties that advanced composites can bring to them.''
   Consider the all-plastic small engine of a New Jersey customer
of Fiberite or the plastic truck tire rims being made by a customer
of Winona-based Polymer Composites Inc.
   ``Our basic strategy is metal replacement,'' said Pat Johnson,
vice president of sales and marketing for Polymer Composites.
   Since Fiberite was purchased in 1984 by Great Britain's Imperial
Chemicals Industries, company growth has been distributed to plants
in other cities, including sites in Japan and Germany.
   But Fiberite was the genesis for at least five spin-off
companies still vibrant inside Winona County.
   Sales at RTP Co., for example, have more than doubled from the
1983 level of $18 million and are expected to grow another 10
percent this year, said Hugh Miller, chairman and chief executive.
   ``We're growing so fast, I have trouble thinking back four or
five years ago,'' said Miller, whose company makes reinforced
plastic pellets with conductive properties used in the computer and
electronics industries.
   Once a division of Fiberite, RTP was sold to Beatrice Co. in
1980 and is now headed by Miller, the son of Fiberite co-founder
Ben Miller.
   Polymer Composites also has Fiberite roots. It was started in
1980 by former Fiberite chemist Ron Hawley. Eight years later,
Hawley sold the business to a subsidiary of Hoechst AG, a West
German conglomerate.
   After a brief retirement, Hawley last year founded another
startup: Composite Products Inc.
   ``It's like that here,'' said Stephen Bowen, Polymer Composites'
chief executive. ``If one company in Winona sells out, usually they
move down the block and start another operation.''
   The enterprising spirit has also struck the university, where
Professor Myron Snesrud helps operate a small scale contract
research facility that expects to count the U.S. Navy as a customer
soon.
   It will be one of the selling points of the school's new
composites engineering program, which Snesrud hopes will attract
250 top-notch students.
   ``The story isn't out yet,'' Snesrud said. ``Mostly it's
children of people in the industry who know about it.''

<HEAD>You Just Don't Understand: The Languages Men and Women Speak</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eleanor and Isaac Cullick are the kind of people
who take time to chat with strangers, but they were barely speaking
to each other when their 12-year marriage broke up in 1971.
   ``He was a lecturer. It seemed that every time he spoke to me,
it was a critique,'' said Eleanor, who now lives in Houston. ``I
don't think he ... was the type of person who could share
experiences and emotions and feelings.''
   ``All I ever did was listen,'' said Isaac, who is remarried and
still lives in Shreveport, La. ``She was going to have things her
way. I couldn't reach Eleanor. It's amazing, people can live
together but can't talk things out.''
   The Cullick's story is not unique. And in her new best seller,
``You Just Don't Understand: Women and Men in Conversation,''
Georgetown University sociolinguist Deborah Tannen suggests why:
   ``Because men and women are regarding the landscape from
contrasting vantage points, the same scene can appear very
different to them, and they often have opposite interpretations of
the same action.''
   No one is to blame here, the author cautions.
   It's just that people of different genders generally speak
different languages. Tannen reached that conclusion after studying
hundreds of hours of videotaped conversations between men and
women, boys and girls.
   ``Men and women grow up in different worlds,'' Tannen said in a
recent interview. ``It's utterly essential that people accept and
understand the differences. Otherwise we end up blaming each
other.''
   Over 15 years of research, Tannen said she's seen clear
conversational patterns emerge. Men use talk primarily to
communicate a desire or goal, while women consider exchanges
important in and of themselves, she said.
   To a woman, hashing through the day's details often indicates
intimacy. For her mate, the ritual may simply seem a drag.
   Similarly, she said, ``Women often feel a relationship is
working if you're talking about it. Men feel it's working if you're
not talking about it.''
   ``A lot of men feel that a woman's insistence on talking things
out is like a dog hanging onto a bone,'' said Tannen, who lives and
teaches in Washington. ``But for women, talk is the glue that holds
relationships together.''
   These are stereotypes, but sociolinguists said they apply more
often than not. Since the publication of her book this spring,
Tannen said she has received scores of telephone calls and letters
from fans of her theory.
   ``Misunderstood gender differences is one of the biggest causes
of divorce,'' said Howard Markman, who directs the University of
Denver's Center for Marital and Family Studies.
   ``It's a pervasive problem ... but couples who learn how to
understand each other can successfully improve their chances of
having a happy marriage,'' the marital researcher said.
   John and Kass Patterson did. The couple took Markman's
``Premarital Relationship Enhancement Program'' before they wed two
years ago. Today they are expecting their first child.
   ``A lot of people wondered why we took the course,'' said Kass,
who lives with her husband in Denver. ``But it really helped us get
our marriage off on the right foot.''
   It wasn't that the couple would otherwise have started out in a
tangle of unusual problems. The Pattersons just didn't want to
waste time bickering about the banal: finances, tardiness, who
interrupted whom.
   ``Women are trained throughout their lives on how to talk things
out and express feelings,'' said Kass, 30, a legal secretary. ``I
am still more the one that pulls things out of John, but since the
course he's much more vocal.''
   Each also understands better what the other is trying to say.
   ``You become aware of the differences in the way you argue,''
Kass said. ``Sometimes there's no changing the other person, but
understanding eases the frustration.''
   Decoding the ways men and women communicate is not only helpful
on the homefront, sociolinguists said. Gender-based conflicts show
up and can be resolved in the workplace as well.
   Take, for instance, the way in which a male employee interpreted
an order from Barbara Meade, co-owner of Politics &amp; Prose Bookstore
in Washington.
   ``I wanted him to do some specific tasks having to do with
bookkeeping ... and thought it was understood,'' Meade recalled.
``But apparently ... he thought I was asking if he'd be willing to
do it.''
   Tannen says this is common. Women often couch a direct order in
an interrogative phrase: ``Would you mind ...'' Whereas men usually
say simply: ``Do it.''
   Both bosses may be issuing an order, she said, but a male
employee will likely interpret a female boss's request as optional
while a female employee will often find her male boss's style
unnecessarily peremptory.
   ``It's like speaking English and French. It's not that one is
better than the other,'' said Robin Lakoff, a linguist at the
University of California at Berkeley. ``They are just different.''
   Gender studies experts, whose field has blossomed since the late
1970s, said the communication gap is rooted in childhood. Boys and
girls generally play separately and interact differently,
researchers said.
   ``Boys' groups are hierarchical and activities-oriented,''
Tannen said. ``Girls' groups tend to be egalitarian, smaller. They
tend to have one best friend ... and spend a lot of time telling
secrets.''
   When they grow up, women often expect their mates to be that
same best friend, which often baffles men more comfortable with
locker room towel-snapping than sharing secrets.
   Tannen said couples can reach a happy medium with time, patience
and compromise. But it will take a lot more to change the
fundamental mindsets that separate men and women, researchers said.
   ``The kinds of language differences we see reflect real
differences in the way men and women are in the world,'' said Penny
Eckert of the Institute for Research on Learning in Palo Alto,
Calif.
   ``Language is symptomatic of other things, of underlying power
relations ... in a male-dominated society,'' Eckert said.
``(Tannen's) book is only a point of departure, a place to start
discussing sexism.''

<HEAD>New Jersey's Top Court Has Established a Bold Tradition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS MARTELLO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even as the highest court in the land
drifts rightward, the highest court in New Jersey is staking out
bold stands in the opposite direction _ and it is gaining influence.
   ``The impact this court has had is incredible,'' said Ronald
K.L. Collins, a state court expert and a visiting associate
professor at Catholic University in Washington, D.C.
   ``There is a battle going on between the United States Supreme
Court and the New Jersey Supreme Court for the conscience of the
courts across the country. On many issues, the question is: Do we
go with the United States Supreme Court, or with New Jersey?''
Collins said.
   To go with New Jersey is take a dizzying tour of judicial
activism.
   In the past three months alone, the New Jersey court has ruled
the state must ensure that as much money is spent to educate
children in poor cities as is spent on those in wealthy suburbs;
that police cannot sift through roadside trash without a search
warrant; and that warning labels on cigarette packages cannot
shield tobacco companies from liability suits.
   These decisions add to a legacy of assertiveness. This was the
court that allowed Karen Ann Quinlan's parents to remove their
comatose daughter from a respirator, and condemned surrogate
motherhood in the ``Baby M'' case.
   The court also has ordered that housing for low-income residents
be built in every municipality. It has ruled that poor women have
the right to state-financed abortions to protect their health.
   When the court found that the state wasn't contributing enough
dollars to provide a fair education to poor students 14 years ago,
it closed public schools. The Legislature then adopted an income
tax to come up with the money.
   Often, the seven state justices are on a collision course with
the U.S. Supreme Court. In these cases, New Jersey justices rely on
the state's 43-year-old constitution, saying it provides greater
protections than afforded by federal court decisions.
   Richard J. Hughes, a former governor and chief justice who wrote
the landmark Quinlan decision, said the New Jersey state
constitution ``is a font of individual liberties. That's why our
court many times goes a little further than the United States
Supreme Court.''
   Constitutional experts say such actions are spurring other state
supreme courts to become more aggressive.
   The New Jersey panel is helping set a course ``where state bills
of rights are seen as independent sources of bills of rights,''
said G. Alan Tarr, chairman of the political science department at
Rutgers University and an author of several books on the court.
   But critics say the New Jersey court goes too far.
   ``The New Jersey Supreme Court makes Earl Warren seem like a
timid soul,'' said Bruce Fein, a constitutional scholar and former
official with the conservative Heritage Foundation. ``They've been
involved in social engineering, and they've been rather inept at
it.''
   He rejects the notion that New Jersey is leading an offensive by
state courts. ``Only about a dozen courts'' are becoming more
active, he said, ``leaving 38 reasonably conservative courts that
stay with the U.S. Supreme Court.''
   Other courts didn't always turn to New Jersey. Before the
adoption of the 1947 Constitution, its courts were political plums
harvested by party bosses.
   ``We discarded the worst court system in the country for the
best,'' said Hughes.
   Constitutional experts say a combination of factors have led New
Jersey down a path few courts have traveled. Although lawmakers and
governors have criticized the court, they have stayed clear of
exacting political revenge. The New Jersey justices are appointed,
not elected. The governor and state Senate can remove or reappoint
justices seven years after they join the court. If they are
reappointed, they serve until age 70.
   ``They have the ability to get involved without too much
political backlash,'' said Tarr. ``There are no elections. They can
make decisions without playing political football.''
   Tarr noted that former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, who branded the
court's decision on low-income housing ``communistic,'' nonetheless
reappointed two justices who supported it, including Chief Justice
Robert N. Wilentz.
   Some of the court's landmark decisions have been a matter of
coincidence: The Quinlan and ``Baby M'' cases just happened to take
place in New Jersey.
   But supporters and critics agree the court's reputation is no
coincidence. In New Jersey, the Supreme Court has long had no
qualms about hearing cases other courts won't touch. And it has
consistently said government has an obligation to protect
individual rights.
   ``The court has said: `You show us a case with enough injustice,
and we will not refrain from acting,' '' Collins said.
   The court's actions on low-income housing and school funding
link ``constitutional justice to economic justice,'' he said. ``It
says that justice is not limited to liberty, but also to economics.
This is constitutional law at its zenith and its most controversial
stage.''
   It has raised the ire of critics who say the court is stretching
the state constitution _ ``Their imagination has been triggered by
something other than the state constitution. The court is making
all of these obligations out of nothing,'' Fein said.
   As the federal courts become more conservative, experts agree
the New Jersey Supreme Court will continue to command center stage.
   ``The New Jersey Court has spawned an environment about the kind
of cases that can be tried there,'' said Collins. ``Cases that
won't go before other courts will come to New Jersey.''

   The night was filled with fierce mosquitoes,
humidity thick as an invisible syrup, and the cries of a politician
railing against indolent welfare recipients.
   ``I don't mind them having illegitimate babies, ladies and
gentlemen,'' David Duke shouted to supporters at a coastal rally.
``I just don't think we should have to pay for them.''
   Duke is the head of the National Association for the Advancement
of White People, former grand wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan, a man who once wore a swastika. They are white and
blue-collar workers, and they hope to elect him to the U.S. Senate.
   As he continued his tirade against welfare cheats and
affirmative action, they swapped horror stories of welfare abuse,
of waiting at grocery counters to buy bologna while welfare mothers
bought steaks with food stamps.
   Nearly 500 strong, they stood as one, roaring approval, when he
talked of working for benefits and competing for jobs on merit.
When he charged that the liberals in Washington had sold working
men and women down the river, many responded with open yells that
``the niggers are taking over.''
   Duke, a boyish-looking 40, was elected last year to the
Louisiana House from the New Orleans suburbs. His bills aimed at
welfare and affirmative action have met with no success, but he has
proven himself an articulate spokesman for the far right. His fans
regard him as more than a messenger; they see him as a savior.
   ``Duke's the only chance we've got to let America know we're
tired of those lazy bastards collecting checks,'' a woman yelled
over the din of a typical Duke rally.
   ``We want people to get off their ass and go to work,'' said an
elderly postmaster in a tiny rural community who showed up to hear
Duke in central Louisiana. ``We've got to have someone stand up for
us. We're paying the tab for the coloreds. Even our president is a
nigger-lover.''
   Duke drew widespread attention in 1973 when as a university
student he demonstrated in a Nazi uniform against anti-war
protesters. Later in the 1970s, he took off his hood as the
persuasive head of the Klan.
   He was accused of trying to sell secret Klan membership lists,
and in 1980 he left the KKK and formed the NAAWP. In the next few
years, he ran unsuccessfully for a state Senate seat, wrote for a
living and operated a bookstore.
   He defeated the brother of former Republican Gov. Dave Treen for
a state House seat in 1989 and only a few months later started
talking about the U.S. Senate race.
   The national GOP has repudiated Duke's candidacy and let out a
collective groan when he opened a Washington office under the
auspices of a group called Republican Action for the 90s. ``The
Duke Revolution of the '90s will collapse liberalism at home,'' the
group said in a letter to conservatives.
   While Duke builds steam, U.S. Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., has
barely launched his re-election campaign and state Sen. Ben Bagert
_ the designated Republican nominee _ is a distant third, despite
appearances with Ollie North and Robert Bork.
   A recent poll for television stations gave Johnston 52 percent
of the voters' support, Duke 24 percent and Bagert 7 percent.
   All three and another three unknowns will compete Oct. 6 in an
open primary. Professional political consultants say Duke has a
good shot at keeping Johnston below 50 percent and thereby forcing
a runoff in November, but they say ultimately he won't be able to
overcome the three-term Senate veteran.
   Johnston has urged voters to avoid a runoff, saying it would
attract even more undesirable national attention to the state.
   ``It matters what people outside Louisiana think,'' said
Johnston. ``We don't want people to think we're like South Africa.
People don't invest their money there.''
   Gus Weill, the dean of Louisiana's political consultants,
attributed much of Duke's appeal to the state's ailing economy.
   ``In Louisiana, we are absolutely in hard times and Duke has
presented us with a villain _ black people,'' Weill said. ``He'll
get support that will surprise some people, but there aren't enough
callous people in this state to elect him.''
   Linus Juneau, head of the American Legion in tiny Bordelonville,
predicted a large number of World War II veterans will back Duke.
``People like what he says about giveaways,'' he said. ``They're
not concerned about the past.''
   Duke has spent more than $1.2 million so far to convince voters
that he repudiates the ``reckless past of my youth. I was
intolerant. I'm ashamed of that.'' He stresses in every appearance
that his past is dead.
   There are indications, however, that Duke has not undergone a
complete transformation. As late as 1989, his bookstore still was
selling pro-Nazi literature. And on a television talk show this
month, he was asked about racial songs _ including one called
``Some Niggers Never Die'' _ that he recently sold in his
bookstore. He called them humorous.
   The Rev. James Stovall, chairman of the Louisiana Coalition
Against Racism and Nazism, said Duke's remarks prove he is ``still
a bigot and a hater.''
   Whatever he is, Duke believes he is speaking for millions. ``You
may think my message is just mine,'' he told one audience. ``But
what I'm saying openly is what the other politicians are saying in
private. If a man with my past can be elected to the U.S. Senate,
more politicians will follow and America will be heard.''

<HEAD>Tourist Influx Makes Islanders Restless</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The islanders are restless. Hordes of tourists are
pouring into their hallowed sanctuaries, intruding upon their
ancient ways, corrupting them with cash, snapping their pictures.
   It sounds like a familiar lament from some exotic corner of the
old empire, but these islanders are the British, and many are fed
up with the more than 17 million tourists passing annually through
their small and crowded realm.
   The problem has become serious enough to merit a government task
force. The English Tourist Board has produced a leaflet that
appeals to visitors, foreign and domestic, to behave themselves.
   ``Always remember you are the guest: show consideration for
residents and their environment,'' the leaflet begins. ``Respect
local laws and customs.'' It is called ``20 Tips for Visitors.''
   It advises tourists not to photograph the locals without
permission; to refrain from touching valuable tapestries, vases and
paintings; avoid wearing high-heeled shoes in historic buildings;
and dress appropriately in holy places.
   Although William Davis, chairman of the Tourist Board, insisted
in launching the leaflet that ``We don't want to nag,'' some of the
tips have a distinctly nannyish tone.
   Tourists are advised to say please and thank you, and when
complaining, to ``do it politely.''
   ``Don't argue with staff who seek to enforce rules,'' it says.
``They are only doing their jobs.''
   And, inevitably, ``Don't push, shove or jump queues.''
   Davis says the leaflet does not mean to single out foreigners as
the sole offenders _ it isn't being translated into other languages
_ but it comes at a time of heated debate about whether tourism is
good for the nation.
   Foreign tourism generates $42 billion a year for Britain and
employs 1.5 million people, making it a prime money-earner as heavy
industry declines.
   It is spreading well beyond the familiar landmarks of London.
Foreign tourism in Oxford rose 44 percent between 1983 and 1988.
Bath recorded a 38 percent increase, York and Canterbury 33 percent.
   Internal tourism, measured by the 109 million overnight hotel
stays in 1989, also is a vast industry.
   Some of the people under invasion are protesting, and this has
prompted the government to announce a task force to identify
problem areas.
   ``I travel around the country a lot and have noticed a growing
tension about tourism, and we are seeking a way of heading off a
backlash which could damage the entire industry,'' said Ivor
Manley, the Employment Department official chosen to head the team.
   ``In some areas, like Portsmouth or Bradford, a museum is
welcomed as a badge of civic pride, but in others such a plan would
cause resentment,'' he said at a news conference. ``They do not
want tourists in their town and will not build for them.''
   Officials say they want to spread tourism to less familiar
territory, such as Liverpool or the Romney Marshes of Kent county.
Rather than head straight for Westminster Abbey, how about seeing
the Victorian cotton mills of Lancashire, or going down into a
Yorkshire coal mine?
   Davis of the Tourist Board worries about ``the growing tendency
to use the word `tourist' as a term of abuse.''
   Phrases such as ``tourism plague'' and ``hordes,'' he protests,
are ``totally and utterly inappropriate to describe visitors whom
we ought to be making feel welcome in this country.''
   Lately, arguments are being heard that tourism is more trouble
than it's worth.
   ``Tourist coaches congest the central area, and park with
impunity,'' Alfred Sherman wrote in The Sunday Telegraph. ``Public
buildings are disfigured by displays of gimcrack souvenirs. The
tawdry nightlife which mass tourism evokes makes our city centers
and suburbs even more vicious.''
   The Times of London concluded the solution was to ration tourism
by making the main attractions ``charge prices high enough to deter
at least some potential visitors.''
   It is ``an uncongenial concept,'' the paper admitted, ``yet both
elitists and populists must accept that only some form of rationing
can avoid the destruction of places that all the world wants to
visit.''

<DATELINE>YOUNG COMMUNIST LEAGUE ARMY BASE, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Next to a
rutted tank trail on this training base between Leningrad and the
Finnish border, a poster still exhorts: ``Serve as Lenin
Instructed, as the Party Demands.''
   The Soviet Union legalized alternative political groups five
months ago, but the Communist Party is only just beginning to
loosen its dictatorial control over the military.
   ``At this point, the army does not have a multiparty system,''
said Col. Leonid Aksuita, one of about 80,000 professional
political officers among the 4 million military personnel.
   Political officers have spent decades enforcing Communist Party
orders in the army.
   Among the more notable were Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid
Brezhnev, who moved back into regular party jobs after World War II
service as political officers and eventually ruled the country.
   Col. Pavel Medvedev said the party relinquished formal control
of military promotions since losing its constitutionally guaranteed
monopoly on power in March, but acknowledged there had been no
reduction in the party's influence.
   Change clearly is under way, however, and political officers are
seeking new roles in such fields as psychology and public relations.
   This infantry training base, named for the Young Communist
League, still drips with red-painted party slogans. Draftees pore
over propaganda pamphlets and newspapers in the Lenin Room of their
barracks.
   A young Azerbaijani with a shaven head hunched over a pamphlet,
surrounded by images of the party's revered founder. Just five
weeks into training, he already had been assigned as a party
activist and said fellow draftees accepted his proselytizing.
   Had any soldiers ever tried to organize around an alternative
political viewpoint? He shook his head and replied: ``Everybody
wants to represent the Communist Party.''
   Every unit still has a party committee that concerns itself with
everything from combat training to officer housing, soldiers said.
At the national party congress in July, reformers tried
unsuccessfully to have the committees abolished.
   A deputy commander in each unit serves as its political officer.
   Party reformers also tried to eliminate that position. In a
compromise, the ``zampolit'' officers are turning from political
indoctrination to more practical matters like morale, discipline
and recreation.
   Even Gen. Valentin Varennikov, commander of Soviet land forces
and a high-ranking Communist, has a zampolit assigned to him.
   ``My husband could not be a unit commander if he was not a party
member,'' said Lyudmila Leshishina, wife of a major at a paratroop
base on the Polish border, near Brest.
   Communist control is so pervasive that it will be years before
the benefits of multiparty democracy come to the army, said
officers and soldiers interviewed during a two-day press tour.
   ``All the persons I work with are Communists and have the same
points of view,'' said Ivan Skrylnik of the Defense Ministry's new
information department.
   At four bases in three republics, soldiers scoffed at the
possibility of a non-Communist political party trying to organize
within the army.
   ``Literally, in the next 10 years, it's impossible, because 98
percent of the officers and sergeants are Communists,'' said Gen.
Vladislav Lisovsky, deputy commander of the Leningrad military
district.
   Gen. Boris Gromov, commander of the Kiev military district and
former commander of Soviet forces in Afghanistan, seemed almost
puzzled when asked whether the party's influence was diminishing.
   ``I am a Communist,'' he said. ``I know the decisions of the
party and I enforce them myself.''
   Switching the political officers from representing the party to
representing the government is expected to make little difference
immediately, since all zampolits are Communists.
   They acknowledged, however, that their lives were changing
dramatically.
   ``People are different than they were three years ago'' and
unanimity has given way to political debate, said Col. Pavel
Illarionov, a political officer at the Leningrad base.
   ``We can't give commands anymore,'' said Col. Aksuita, political
officer of the Minsk district. ``We have to educate.''
   The stereotypical zampolit, who earned the enmity of his peers
for interfering with military orders, apparently has not entirely
disappeared.
   ``It's a dangerous question,'' Medvedev replied when asked about
such men, then added:
   ``Their activity has dropped since the Brezhnev days,'' seven
years ago. ``It seems as if they are not sure of themselves and not
sure of what to do.''
   Political officers' duties are expected to change even more
because the July party congress decided they must stop preaching
the party line and concentrate on the general welfare of soldiers.
   ``They'll be like, uh, chaplains,'' said Capt. Vadim V. Zvegin,
in an earnest attempt to explain.
   Many political officers are going back to college to earn
degrees in psychology and sociology, said Skrylnik of the military
press office, and others are taking the new job of press officer.
   ``We have much more work with the mass media,'' Illarionov said.
``It used to be they always helped us,'' he added, with evident
nostalgia for the days when the press always followed orders.

   The Endangered Species Act is a powerful tool
for saving wildlife. But power has a price. Development now must
steer clear of nearly 600 species _ no easy task, as a hunt for
phantoms in the forest shows.

<TEXT>
   It was morning in the redwoods,
and Simpson Timber Co.'s owl safari was off to a shaky start.
   ``Hoot. Hoot-Hoot. HooOOOooo,'' company biologist Lowell Diller
called into the forest, then cocked his head to listen.
   But there was no reply.
   Diller, and 17 biologists from the California Department of Fish
and Game, were touring Simpson Timber's holdings along the Northern
California coast. Their quarry: the northern spotted owl, one of
the latest and most controversial additions to the U.S. endangered
species list.
   Environmentalists portray the owl as a victim of human greed, a
shy bird whose home in the Northwest forest is imperiled by
loggers' saws.
   Simpson paints a different picture: that of a creature neither
shy nor particularly threatened by heavy logging on the company's
400,000 acres. ``We have owls practically everywhere,'' Diller
promised.
   Now all he had to do was make one show.
   ``Hoot. Hoot-Hoot. HooOOOooo,'' he called again.
   But there was no reply.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   If the effort to save America's endangered wildlife can be
called a war _ and many wildlife biologists are fond of that
analogy _ then places like Simpson's timberland are at the front
line.
   Such conflicts between wildlife preservation and economic
development are the legacy of the federal Endangered Species Act.
The 1973 law mandates recovery plans for dwindling wildlife
populations and bars any disturbance of species listed as
``threatened'' or ``endangered,'' the act's yellow- and red-alert
labels for creatures nearing extinction.
   At its signing, the act was hailed as a visionary stand for
wildlife decimated by habitat destruction, pollution and
over-hunting.
   But vision doesn't come cheaply. Recovery plans for a growing
list of imperiled species are clashing with paychecks and
pocketbooks as never before.
   Examples span the country:
   _ Saving the spotted owl, declared threatened in June, may
become the most economically disruptive recovery program yet
launched under the act. In one scenario proposed by federal
scientists, logging bans to protect the 6,000 to 10,000 owls left
in California, Oregon and Washington could cost 28,000 jobs over 10
years.
   _ In the Gulf of Mexico, shrimp fishermen have blockaded
harbors, rammed boats and fired shots to protest regulations aimed
at keeping their nets from drowning at least 11,000 endangered sea
turtles a year.
   _ In the Southeast, timber companies oppose a federal program to
protect some 10,000 red-cockaded woodpeckers by closing 1.2 million
acres of national forest to logging.
   _ In Arizona, construction of a $200 million mountaintop
observatory is pitted against the Mount Graham red squirrel, a
subspecies of 150 animals found only on the mountain.
   And there are many more: from Las Vegas, where the desert
tortoise is blamed for delaying flood-control projects and housing
tracts, to Rhode Island, where a popular nude beach was fenced off
this summer to protect a shorebird called the piping plover.
   The list of endangered and threatened U.S. species now includes
588 plants, mammals, fishes, birds, beetles, butterflies, reptiles,
frogs, snails, spiders and clams.
   Endangered clams? Some say the law has gone too far, including
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan. He has repeatedly urged Congress
to weaken the Endangered Species Act to allow more consideration of
economics.
   ``Do we have to save every subspecies?'' Lujan asked in May.
``Nobody's told me the difference between a red squirrel, a black
one or a brown one.''
   But environmentalists say the law's work has just begun. Their
argument: Humans drove most of these creatures to the brink of
extinction, so humans have a duty to rescue them. All of them. Red,
black or brown.
   Such polarized rhetoric erupts whenever economic development
runs afoul of an endangered species, say observers of the debate.
Later, when heads cool and compromise begins, both sides look to
science for facts: How many creatures are out there? What will a
recovery plan cost? And will it do any good?
   Unfortunately, the questions come easier than answers _ as was
evident one recent summer day in the redwoods.

   ``Hoot. Hoot-Hoot. HooOOOooo.'' This time, it was the real
thing. An owl called from somewhere in the trees and Lowell Diller
dashed off, leading a stampede of wildlife officials through the
brush.
   ``There,'' Diller said, pointing to a branch 25 feet up, where a
female owl perched, her talons clutching a dead wood rat. A fluffy
owlet sat nearby, its cream-colored plumage contrasting with the
mother's darker, mottled feathers. The adult male, with his
``hoot-hoot'' call, stayed hidden some distance away.
   According to the established scientific literature, none of
these owls should have been here.
   Northern spotted owls, the literature says, nest in cavities of
decaying, centuries-old trees in the virgin, or old-growth, forest
of the Pacific Northwest. The birds supposedly need the open space
among the old trees to hunt rodents and the treetop canopy to avoid
predators.
   Nobody would mistake Simpson's industrial timberland for the
kind of forest wilderness that environmentalists want set aside for
owls. The company started logging giant old redwoods here at the
turn of the century and now is clear-cutting a second generation of
trees. Burned and blackened stumps dot the naked hills.
   But spotted owls seem to thrive here. Diller has banded more
than 125 owls since March. He estimates there is a nesting pair of
owls per 1,000 acres, one of the highest densities ever reported.
   The birds nest in trees as young as 30 years old, often using
platforms of woody debris on branches. Rather than avoid
clear-cuts, many nest in patches of trees near them, perhaps to
hunt the abundant wood rats, Diller said.
   ``It's very hard to put limits on what spotted-owl habitat is,''
he said. ``We have some interesting things to learn.''
   The same is true about many endangered species, which by their
nature are often hard to study.
   The spotted owl, at least, hoots back.
   Compare it to the marbled murrelet, a chunky little seabird
recently proposed for the endangered list. The murrelet is believed
to nest in coastal old-growth forest from California to Alaska.
Despite extensive searching, however, fewer than 20 nests of the
secretive bird have ever been found.
   Or consider Bartram's ixia, a Florida wildflower that blooms but
one day a year. A proposal to give the plant endangered status
prompted timber companies to launch a hunt for it in May. They hope
to derail the listing by showing that ixia isn't rare, just hard to
spot.
   Things were simpler in the early years of the Endangered Species
Act. Enforcement concentrated on creatures a heartbeat away from
extinction, such as the whooping crane or California condor.
   But now protection plans are in place for most of those
high-profile cases. Attention is turning toward species more
obscure, more widely distributed, or further from extinction.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service adds four or five species to
the endangered list every month, and the task is far from done.
Researchers face a backlog of more than 3,000 candidates, assuring
controversy over endangered species for decades.

   Wholesale unleaded gasoline prices surged over

   No matter what you may have heard, the ordinary
American isn't a financial and economic fool who buys on impulse,
invests on tips, borrows recklessly and ignores the news.
   That sometimes is the reputation they are given by those who
like to claim superior knowledge, such as certain economists and
financial advisers who live off the claim that they can see into
the future.
   But when the chips are down _ when the economy's future is in
doubt _ who do these people turn to for advice? None other than the
consumer, whose aggregate buying, selling or savings often
determines economic direction.
   Consumers speak with their pocketbooks. Theirs is a real world,
where they watch their cash.
   Growth in personal consumption in the second quarter fell to the
lowest rate since the 1981-1982 recession. The increase in retail
sales last month was an almost imperceptible 0.1 percent.
   Consumer spending for non-durable items such as food and
clothing in the second quarter actually fell 1 percent from the
comparable period a year earlier, and spending on durables such as
cars and furniture also fell.
   Consumers are pulling in their credit cards. Installment credit
in the first half of the year rose at only a 2.3 percent annual
rate, a fraction of the increase last year. The personal savings
rate has been rising.
   In such numbers as these lie strong, almost certain clues to the
future, because the consumer economy makes up two-thirds of gross
national product, more by far than government and business together.
   These are the clues that so-called experts examine before
telling ordinary mortals what they think the economic future holds.
It makes ``expert'' forecasting easy; the consumer has already told
the expert what to expect.
   The consumer's intelligence about these matters is nearly
foolproof. It comes not from abstractions relied upon by many
intellectual theorists, but from hard data contained in the family
checking account. Money speaks.
   Disposable income during the year's first half, mainly money
left after taxes, rose at a rate of just 1.5 percent a year, less
than one-third the rate of 1988 and well below that of 1989.
   If you haven't got the income you can't continue with the outgo,
at least for very long. Many consumers tried that _
credit-to-income ratios are near record highs _ but there's a
limit, and millions have reached it.
   There are many concrete, dollar-and-cents reasons, therefore,
for changes in consumer spending and saving. There are more
intellectual reasons too, based on consumer interpretations of the
state of domestic and world affairs.
   Throughout this year consumers have expressed doubts about the
economy's continued strength. They have read about the decline in
profits, of Washington's inability to deal with the budget, of woes
in financial circles.
   Now they face the prospect of higher energy prices and an
economy that might have to be directed more to military purposes
and less to the production of marketplace items. Uncertainty,
including job insecurity, is widespread.
   All this blunts the urge to spend, and spurs the urge to
conserve, and in the process tends to change the direction of the
economy.
   In a sense, consumer power directs the economy's future, which
is a lot more than can be claimed by the ``experts.''

   Employees at Survival Technology Inc. are
accelerating production of an item they hope will never be used _ a
nerve gas antidote for American troops in the Mideast.
   ``It helps the company, but you've got to be concerned because
it means there's a war going on somewhere and that's not good,''
said J. Frank Harmon, director of manufacturing for the company's
pharmaceutical division.
   Survival Technology, based in Bethesda, Md., makes 95 percent of
the non-communist world's supply of the antidote at its plant here
in suburban St. Louis.
   It is the only American supplier of the antidote, which troops
in the Persian Gulf area may need if Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
uses his stockpile of deadly poisonous gases.
   Six days after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, the Defense
Department asked the company to speed up production of 85,000 kits
it wasn't scheduled to deliver until the end of September.
   At the same time, the government asked for an additional $2
million worth, which Harmon said amounted to several hundred
thousand kits of two ``auto-inject'' drug-filled syringes.
   In response, the company delayed its annual summer maintenance
shutdown and asked 31 production employees to postpone vacations to
help finish the order over the weekend. All said they would.
   ``They take tremendous pride in manufacturing something, knowing
that lives are very literally at stake,'' Harmon said.
   Employees said they didn't mind canceling vacation plans and
working 10-and 12-hour days to get the order completed.
   ``You know, it's a crucial time, but we're glad to be here to be
able to help support the government,'' said employee Wanda Moose.
``Every syringe I make is just like saving a life.''
   Harmon said the company expected to ship the second order in
about a month. Additional orders from friendly foreign governments
also are expected to come in, he said. Unlike the United States,
some countries do not have any of the antidote in stock.
   The federal government's request came as U.S. troops and planes
moved into Saudi Arabia for a possible confrontation with Iraq.
Although chemical warfare was banned by the Geneva Disarmament
Conference in 1971 because of its heinous nature, Iraq used nerve
gas and mustard gas in its eight-year war with Iran and against its
own Kurdish minority.
   While there is no known antidote to mustard gas, which burns the
skin on contact, the antidote Survival Technology makes is
effective against all known forms of nerve gas, Harmon said.
   The antidote kit consists of atropine, which stops the
paralyzing effects of nerve gas, and pralidoxime chloride, which
helps return the body's functions to normal.
   Harmon said soldiers carry three packs of the antidote, each of
which is effective for two to six hours, depending on how soon the
drugs are administered.
   To help speed the delivery of the drugs, they are contained in
two separate spring-loaded injectors about the size of cigars. The
soldier pulls off the cap and presses the injector against his
thigh; the spring inside fires the hidden needle into his leg, even
through heavy protective clothing.
   The auto-ejector device was invented by the company's founder,
the late Stanley Sarnoff, who was a cardiologist at the National
Institutes of Health. Sarnoff was looking for a way for people to
easily administer lifesaving drugs, including nerve gas antidote on
the battlefield.
   Before the auto-injector, the military used a needle attached to
a small tube. The soldier had to push the needle under his skin and
squeeze the tube to administer the drug.
   ``Most syringes are rather imposing,'' Harmon said. ``A lot of
people have a real aversion to needles.''
   With the auto-injector, ``as soon as you feel the pinch, it's
over,'' he said.
   Since 1975, the company has made more than 50 million doses of
the nerve gas antidote and can make 1.5 million a month at full
production. The kits cost about $10 and have a shelf life of five
years, Harmon said.
   The plant generally produces several million doses a year. It
also has sold the antidote kits to other countries, including
Canada, Jordan and Israel.

<HEAD>Greater Interest in Natural Gas Vehicles</HEAD>

   The Persian Gulf crisis could stir interest
in compressed natural gas and some in the industry say continued
high gasoline prices would make it easier to sell businesses on the
technology.
   Companies that operate large fleets of cars or trucks are seen
as the most likely consumers of CNG, but before they make a large
investment in compatible vehicles, they'll have to be convinced
they'll save money.
   ``We have to show them the long-term economic benefit, not a
short-term benefit based on a disruption overseas,'' said Jack
Rigg, spokesman for Amoco Oil Co.
   The main attraction of CNG in recent years has been pollution
control, but the American Gas Association hopes the Persian Gulf
crisis will open up a new market for natural gas.
   ``We think the economic benefits will be there in the long run,
as well as environmental benefits and now energy security,'' said
George Lawrence, AGA president. Another part of the AGA's pitch for
CNG is that 93 percent of the United States' gas supplies currently
come from domestic sources.
   There are already 30,000 vehicles in the United States running
on natural gas. Most of them are in company fleets where the gas is
compressed at the motor pool.
   Amoco last week opened a CNG pump at one of its stations in
Denver, but access to CNG remains the main obstacle to widespread
use.
   For now, the economic benefits of CNG are apparent. The CNG
equivalent of a gallon of gasoline costs about 70 cents, the AGA
said. Unleaded self-serve regular gasoline averaged $1.237 a gallon
Monday, according to the American Automobile Association. The
average price has risen 16.2 cents since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug.
2, the AAA said.
   General Motors Corp. announced July 24 that it would begin
production early next year of at least 1,000 light-duty trucks that
would run on natural gas and be available for utility and private
fleet use in California and Texas.
   ``Any time you see gas prices go up, you start to look for
alternatives. This is definitely an alternative,'' said Thomas
Klipstine, a spokesman for GM's truck division.
   A price for the vehicles hasn't been determined, but the company
says they will be competitively priced. Amoco says it costs about
$2,000 to convert a vehicle to accept both CNG and gasoline.
   Although Texas Land Commissioner Garry Mauro commended GM for
taking a step toward meeting alternative fuel demands for the
1990s, Klipstine said the driving force behind GM's involvement was
the environment.
   ``In terms of saying it is an alternative fuel, that depends on
what happens. Who knows at this point,'' Klipstine said. ``From an
efficiency, economical and availability standpoint, gasoline is
still the best thing going. When one of those things change, the
interest in an alternative fuel peaks.''
   In Oklahoma, ONEOK Inc., a gas company, has had its CNG program
in place for about eight years. Among its clientele are the Tulsa
Public Schools' buses and a fleet of cars used by the state's motor
pool division in Oklahoma.
   Chuck Callahan, ONEOK's manager of commercial marketing,
believes Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has raised the interest level of
fleet operators considering conversion to CNG.
   ``It certainly improves the economic benefits, also,'' Callahan
said. ``Every time the price of gas goes up a dime, it makes
conversion look that much better.''
   Another of the drawbacks to CNG is its shorter range _ about 150
miles per tank. CNG vehicles also carry heavier tanks, although
energy companies are exploring remedies.
   In Tulsa County, officials are talking about converting 25 of
their 294 county vehicles. The conversion will cost about $40,000,
which would be paid by a loan from the Oklahoma Alternative Fuels
Conversion Fund.
   Tulsa County Clerk Joan Hastings says converting 25 vehicles
would save about $15,000 a year in the difference between CNG and
gasoline.

   The power outage that darkened parts of Wall
Street for a week has revived a debate that gains force with
electronic trading, high real estate costs and gripes about the
city's infrastructure and transportation.
   Does the nation's financial market need to be based in New York?
   Some Wall Street executives, angered by delays in restoring
power that caused potential losses in the millions, said New York
is on the verge of an exodus by financial firms that logistically
could operate just about anywhere.
   ``Everyone on the Street is just waiting for one of the major
houses to pull the plug,'' said Daniel Schwartz, managing director
of Ulmer Brothers Inc., a small investment banking firm that
operated out of Schwartz's Brooklyn brownstone house until
regaining power Monday.
   ``If that happens I think you would see a domino effect,'' he
said.
   Others said deal-makers and stock traders need the centralized
nature of the financial markets and New York's constant hum.
   ``I don't expect it's going to happen for another 25 years,''
Michael Mendelson, president of Fahenstock &amp; Co., a Wall Street
firm founded in 1881, said of a major power outage. ``This is still
the most practical place to be.''
   Consolidated Edison Co. of New York said power was back Monday
at all 1,600 customers in a 30-block area knocked out Aug. 13. The
outage initially included some major Wall Street firms, the
American Stock Exchange and the World Trade Center.
   Power was restored to many buildings the same day, while others
remained out all week.
   Firms that worked on backup generators and at the offices of
friendly competitors criticized the city's utility for decisions
such as restoring power to the Fulton Fish Market before the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
   ``They restored power to the fish market before the central
bank,'' said one executive who asked not to be named. ``That gives
you a reading on the city's priorities.''
   Wall Street executives said at least one major institution was
intensifying relocation plans in the blackout's aftermath. Others
reviewed emergency plans. Several said the problems dealing with
Con Edison reflected badly on the city's concern about the
financial markets.
   Con Ed spokesman Martin Gitten said: ``You do the best you can
and you meet the needs as they are available with the equipment and
people you have. The matter was handled in the best way we could at
the time.''
   The two biggest firms in the area out for the week _ Nomura
Securities International Inc. and Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
_ said they resumed full operations Monday after running on backup
power.
   The Fed successfully returned its electronic-payments system to
lower Manhattan after switching to an alternate computer center in
in Pearl River north of the city last Thursday.
   The move, which occurred after two of three backup generators
failed, slowed banking transactions and government securities
trading and led the Fed to consider declaring a bank holiday that
would have stalled $900 billion in transactions daily.
   Wall Street and its environs have been the central location for
the banking and securities industries since stock trading began in
1792. The first major firm didn't move from the area until 1969,
when Smith Barney relocated in midtown Manhattan. More recently,
though, many firms have shifted some operations to Brooklyn and New
Jersey.
   Others are deciding whether to leave New York entirely. Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co. is discussing options for when leases expire in 1998
and ``that includes the city, that includes outside the city,'' a
spokeswoman said.
   ``The reasons for being in a central location are a historical
anachronism,'' said Junius W. Peake, a securities industry
consultant. ``Over time as you get away from trading systems that
are people intensive . . . geography becomes less important.''
   Despite the outage, the city's crowded highways, maligned
subways and high office costs, many executives said the benefits of
doing business in New York still outweigh the ills. Meeting and
servicing clients, recruiting employees, proximity to the New York
Stock Exchange all favor the city.
   ``It's also a quality of life issue,'' said Creighton Peet,
administrative partner with the investment firm Cowen &amp; Co. ``A lot
of people like living in New York.''
   ``There's a closeness between the different parts of the trading
community. It's important to their businsess to interact directly.
That aspect would be hard to replace if you moved people all over
to remote spots,'' he said.

   When Lukasz Malachowski edited an influential
weekly back home in Poland, the bottom line was maintaining
journalistic integrity while avoiding the ire of Communist
government censors.
   Came the revolution and all that changed. The censors were gone,
but so were the government subsidies for essentials like paper and
ink. Competing for survival became the new bottom line.
   ``Everything was subsidized or donated. We never had to think
whether it could be sold or not. ... Now we have to think over all
these things or nobody will be able to survive,'' says Malachowski,
35, whose Catholic Weekly Review essentially went broke with the
change to a market economy.
   This summer, Malachowski is one of 15 Eastern European
journalists spending 10 weeks at American magazine like Elle,
Rolling Stone, Business Week, Family Circle and Esquire in an
internship program sponsored by the U.S. government and the
magazines.
   The interns, seasoned journalists in their mid-30s from
Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and
Romania, have come to the United States to learn how a free and
competitive press works.
   ``They have to learn to operate a magazine as a business,'' says
Anne Sutherland Fuchs, senior vice president and publisher of Elle,
who organized the magazine industry's role in the internship
program.
   ``They haven't been faced with circulation decisions,
subscription-pricing decisions ... advertising rates. Everything
has been dictated _ whether it's the kind of paper they print on or
how many copies they print,'' she says.
   ``It's a whole different ballgame when it's a free press.''
   Sitting in his cubicle at Elle magazine, Peter Janos Sos, 41,
leafed through a copy of Kepes 7 (Illustrated Week in English), the
Hungarian family weekly of which he is deputy editor in chief. The
first advertisement in the 60-page magazine appeared on page 30; it
promoted paving stones.
   Then he pulled an issue of Elle toward him and turned the glossy
pages filled with ads enticing the reader to buy expensive
cosmetics, designer clothing, glamorous perfumes and chic
accessories.
   ``At first I thought the quality of advertisements is not the
job of the editor but the job of the advertiser,'' says Sos, a
burly man who chooses his English words carefully. ``I talked about
it with Anne Fuchs and she said `I would never take the
advertisement of X here on the first pages because it's not
beautiful enough.'''
   The Eastern European journalists admire the sleek look of their
host publications, their advertising know-how and technical
expertise. Above all, they admire the huge sums of money that go
into making the magazines. They are also fiercely proud of their
magazines at home. But this pride goes hand in hand with a deep
frustration about their financial and technical limitations.
   Gyorgyi Kocsis, 36, an intern at Business Week, helped found a
weekly economic magazine 12 years ago in Budapest, Hungary, that
broke new ground in up-to-date, critical reporting at a time when
most publications were mouthpieces for the government.
   HVG, the Hungarian initials for World Economy Weekly, became ``a
very popular quality magazine in Hungary,'' says Ms. Kocsis. But in
the last two years, she adds, as new newspapers and magazines hit
the market, it lost 15 percent of its readership and suffered an
``identity crisis.''
   She pointed on her cluttered desk at Business Week to a recent
issue of her magazine. The cover shows pieces of paper representing
stock shares coming out of factory chimneys. The illustration is in
black and white and the paper on which it is printed is rough.
   ``Some of our ideas on the cover, gags, pictures can be on any
world magazine. But I have to look with a looking glass because the
printing is so awful,'' says Ms. Kocsis. HVG's look suffers badly
in comparison to ``all the beautiful magazines on the newsstand
here.''
   Suddenly, unable to contain her frustration, she gestures toward
her magazine and exclaims, ``Now, I hate it!''
   But as the Eastern European magazines get slicker and fatter
with advertisements and censorship becomes a thing of the past,
even journalists who are ardent supporters of a free-market economy
feel a bittersweet twinge as their old world collapses.
   The ``family business'' atmosphere at HVG probably will
disappear, Ms. Kocsis says wistfully.
   ``Probably it will be more professional and big and sort of
westernized. We will lose this feeling. We are going to be news
factory, which can be good and useful and profiting, but probably
we will lose this friendly atmosphere, I think. But we have to grow
up.''
   Malachowski, an intern at Family Circle, recently lost his job
as a top editor at the Catholic Weekly Review in Warsaw, Poland. As
the only independent newspaper tolerated by the Communist Party,
its coverage of politics and social issues was very influential, he
says.
   Today, the Catholic Church, trying to cope in a free-market
economy and pay its bills, has let the weekly become a slim
pamphlet on religious affairs, Malachowski says.
   ``We always treated our press as a sort of art piece and now we
must start to think about this as a sort of product,'' says
Malachowski, whose wire-rimmed glasses and tweed jacket reinforce
his professorial air.
   Anyway, he adds, people aren't as interested in art any more.
Poetry, he notes, thrived in the 1960s and 1970s in Poland when
government censorship was extremely strict.
   ``The problem is that today you have no censorship, but much
less people are interested in poetry,'' he says. ``A new generation
thinks about commercial things _ about houses, cars, about normal
things as they are in the whole Western world.''
   ``The condition of the economy in Poland gives us an absolutely
new situation,'' says Malachowski. ``The press is (financially)
bankrupt. It is difficult to survive with magazines and papers. We
need to see the average American paper or magazine to find out how
it works.''
   American know-how goes a long way. But it doesn't translate
directly into hard currency. The survival of Eastern European
magazines and newspapers also depends on Western companies
investing capital in them. HVG, Kepes 7 and Mlady Svet, the largest
weekly in Czechoslovakia, all have made deals with foreign
companies or are close to doing so.
   Mlady Svet, the Young Word in English, takes three weeks to
produce, complains Marek Hlavica, 28, an editor at the weekly. He
also is a singer and harmonica player and is spending his
internship at Rolling Stone magazine.
   If his magazine, founded by the youth group of the Communist
Party, is to stay ahead of its growing pack of competitors, he
says, it needs an infusion of money from foreign investors to
upgrade its technical capabilities.
   ``The magazine is one stone in the mosaic of the whole society,
and it must change with those things _ politics, society and so
on,'' Hlavica says.
   ``But we are optimists. We've got a good starting position.
That's very important. We've got tradition, good tradition. We've
got good writers. We've got opportunity to cooperate with foreign
companies. So we are optimists. Why not?''

   Commercial airlines have yet to feel the pinch
of a diversion of jets for the military airlift to Saudi Arabia,
but an industry official says service could be disrupted under a
prolonged airlift.
   ``We're operating routinely,'' Don Morrison of Trans World
Airlines said Monday, three days after the Pentagon activated the
Civil Reserve Fleet.
   On Friday, the Pentagon mobilized 38 of the 508 commercial jets
available for diversion. About 20 large jets from the 16 airlines
under the program are being used each day, according to the
Military Airlift Command.
   Airline officials say they are under Pentagon instructions not
to disclose details of their participation.
   Pan Am said Monday it has had to cancel a small number of
flights and put smaller planes on others, but spokesman Jeff
Kriendler said the impact has been minimal.
   Northwest Airlines spokesman Bob Gibbons would not rule out the
possibility of future disruptions, but said that as of Monday
afternoon there had been no disruptions in the carrier's regular
passenger flights.
   ``A lot depends on when they call for the airplanes,'' he said.
   Tim Neale, Air Transport Association spokesman, said most
airlines have a minimal number of planes in reserve and the
military call-up could reduce their options in case mechanical
failure takes an airliner out of service.
   Cargo carriers are in a relatively slow season now, Neale said,
but could feel the pinch if the emergency fleet is still being used
during the Christmas season.
   Further forced usage of commercial jets would require an order
from the defense secretary, who could commandeer up to 506
airliners for use on 48 hours' notice.
   This is the first time the Civil Reserve Air Fleet has been used
since it was set up in 1952 during a period of bomb-shelter
building and heightened concern over military readiness.
   The initial order came from the Military Transportation Command
at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois and requires planes to be used
on military flights on 24 hours' notice.
   The planes remain available for commercial flights when they are
not being used by the military.
   Carriers are paid for all flights under military contracts which
require them to commit set numbers of aircraft and crews in times
of crisis.
   ``The airlines maintain operational control of their airplanes.
We just make them a deal they can't refuse,'' said airlift command
spokesman Lt. Col. Mike Cox.
   Airlines are paid for the mandatory military charters at rates
set under their regular military contracts, which include
reimbursement for extra insurance costs and the cost of keeping the
planes ready for such a call-up.
   The commitment to join the fleet is part of their obligation
under lucrative military contracts that are a significant source of
revenue for some airlines during peacetime.
   Cox said 20 or more DC10, DC8, L1011 and Boeing 747 jetliners
were being used each day since the fleet was activated.
   The order to activate the civilian fleet came one day after
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner had told authorities he
thought it would be unnecessary. Transportation Department
officials said Skinner was not involved in the military decision.
   The military said it had tried for several days to conduct the
massive airlift by calling upon airlines individually to charter
planes but found it couldn't muster enough planes for the rapid
troop deployment.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration likely won't get its
wish for lower interest rates because of the Federal Reserve's
concern over increased inflationary pressures stemming partly from
the Persian Gulf crisis, economic analysts believe.
   These analysts forecast that short-term interest rates such as
banks' benchmark prime lending rate will remain unchanged in coming
weeks at 10 percent. Long-term rates, such as 30-year home
mortgages, will come under increasing upward pressure, the analysts
say.
   That gloomy assessment of interest rate prospects was being made
as Fed policymakers convene today in Washington for a meeting of
the Federal Open Market Committee. The panel, headed by Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan, is responsible for setting the central
bank's interest rate policies.
   While the results of the closed-door deliberations will not be
disclosed until Oct. 5, many analysts expected the meeting to
produce no change in the Fed's current tight money policies despite
pleas from the administration for a looser credit stance to keep
the country out of a recession.
   ``The central bank is trapped with the situation in the Middle
East limiting the Fed's options considerably,'' said Allen Sinai,
chief economist of the Boston Co. ``Ultimately, a recession will
bring forth some credit easing on the part of the Fed, but there is
simply too much inflation in the system for the Fed to ease at this
point.''
   In normal times with the economy close to a recession, the Fed
would be expected to loosen its grip on the money supply and allow
interest rates to fall as a way of stimulating economic growth to
avert a downturn or at least lessen its severity.
   But analysts said that this time around, in part because of the
Mideast crisis, inflationary pressures are rising at the same time
that economic growth is slowing.
   Even before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait caused oil prices
to shoot up by about $8 per barrel, there were signs of growing
inflationary pressures. The government last week reported that
consumer prices climbed a brisk 0.4 percent in July and for the
entire year have been rising at a worrisome annual rate of 5.8
percent.
   Any sign that the Fed was giving up the fight against inflation
could make investors more skittish and send interest rates even
higher, analysts believe.
   ``Fed policy makers would like to ease but they are hamstrung,''
said Lawrence Chimerine, a senior fellow at the Economic Strategy
Institute, a Washington research organization. ``They will not be
able to act until both the oil market and the bond market
stabilize.''
   That forecast will not bring cheer at the White House, where the
administration has been unrelenting in its pressure on the Fed to
lower interest rates to stave off a downturn.
   Last week, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said that rising
oil prices resulting from the Mideast crisis likely would cut
already sluggish economic growth in half for the rest of the year.
   He predicted the economy, as measured by the gross national
product, would grow at a barely discernible 0.75 percent rate for
the rest of the year if oil prices remain near current levels. That
would be down from an already anemic 1.5 percent GNP growth rate in
the first half of the year.
   Many private analysts are even more pessimistic, forecasting
that a recession _ defined as a contracting GNP _ is very likely to
begin, probably in the final three months of this year.
   ``This economy is headed for a recession unless the Middle East
calms down in a hurry,'' said David Wyss, senior financial analyst
at DRI-McGraw Hill.
   Wyss said that because of inflationary pressure the Fed would
not be able to push interest rates low enough to avert a downturn.
However, he said he was looking for a slight easing move by the
central bank, perhaps as early as mid-September.
   Wyss predicted that the move, when it comes, likely would trim
the federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other on
overnight loans, from a current level of 8 percent down to 7.75
percent.
   In addition to inflation, another factor limiting the Fed's
maneuvering room is recent weakness in the dollar, which has been
sliding on foreign exchange markets.
   With interest rates rising in other countries, the Fed will be
unable to significantly cut rates in the United States for fear of
making it even harder for America to finance its budget and trade
deficits with foreign capital, economists said.

   Toys R Us and six other major distributors
continue to sell unsafe imported toys despite warnings by the
Consumer Product Safety Commission, the government alleges in
lawsuits aimed at halting the sales.
   Toys R Us, which operates 411 discount toy stores, and the other
companies were named in civil suits filed Monday by the Justice
Department and the CPSC.
   The complaints charged that the companies sold baby rattles,
dolls, stuffed animals and crib toys that either had small parts
that could choke young children or contained excessive amounts of
lead paint.
   CPSC spokesman Dan Rumelt said most of the toys come from
Taiwan, with the rest from Hong Kong, China and South Korea.
   Government officials said the two agencies knew of no deaths or
injuries from the toys. Some of the items have been seized from
store shelves and some others already sold have been recalled by
distributors.
   ``These cases emphasize the need for American companies to
ensure that foreign-made toys are of the same legally-required
standards as U.S.-manufactured toys,'' Leslie Southwick, a deputy
assistant attorney general, said in a statement.
   But a spokesman for one of the companies sued, Value Merchants,
Inc., of Milwaukee, said the problem will not be solved until the
Customs Service is given enough inspectors to check imported
products.
   Mike Mervis, a spokesman for Value Merchants, said the company
had recalled all nine items CPSC cited as unsafe. Value Merchants
thought the toys met government standards but ``the product bought
and the product that was shipped may have been different things,''
he said.
   Mervis blamed inadequate inspection of foreign goods by the U.S.
Customs Service for the recurring problem.
   ``There is no foolproof way to control this without much
stronger federal intervention and some means of controlling the
inspection process'' in factories overseas, Mervis said. ``Anything
that gets through we then become responsible for regardless of our
best efforts.''
   Value Merchants said it will continue to try to negotiate a
resolution with the CPSC.
   But Toys R Us, headquartered in Paramus, N.J., indicated it
would fight the suit filed against the company.
   Michael Goldstein, an executive vice president, said the suit
``is without merit. Our safety record is excellent.''
   ``We believe we will prevail in the legal action and we believe
it's a waste of the taxpayers' money,'' said Goldstein, who was
named as a defendant in the suit against the company.
   Also sued were: Child World Inc., of Avon, Mass.; Lionel Leisure
Inc., of Philadelphia; Illco Toy Company, USA, Inc., of New York;
Beachcombers International Inc. of Fort Meyers, Fla.; and Division
Sales Inc. of Itasca, Ill.
   A woman who answered the telephone at Lionel Leisure, a
subsidiary of Lionel Corp., declined to comment, saying she was
unaware of the lawsuit.
   ``Until we receive legal service, as far as we're concerned we
haven't been sued by anybody,'' said the woman, who refused to
identify herself.
   An official of Division Sales, who also refused to identify
himself, declined to comment, saying he ``didn't know anything
about it.''

   The states' chief law officers complain that a
lack of federal leadership is forcing them to launch their own
investigations of possible price gouging by oil companies since the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   ``The Justice Department has the stronger hand,'' Illinois
Attorney General Neil F. Hartigan said Monday at a special meeting
of the National Association of Attorneys General. ``We'd like to
get them to play it.''
   But he said the Justice Department suffers from ``political
laryngitis and massive amnesia.''
   Florida has subpoenaed 16 major oil companies to determine if
oil prices were being fixed. New York is issuing subpoenas to
retail service stations charging particularly high prices, and
North Carolina has taken Exxon to court on suspicion of retroactive
pricing. Pennsylvania is investigating possible price collusion.
   The attorneys general from 24 states and representatives of 12
other states met Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission
officials to press for action against oil companies found rigging
prices since the invasion Aug. 2.
   Retail gasoline prices have jumped 20 cents to 30 cents a gallon
in many parts of the country.
   The attorneys general also issued a 15-point plan that includes
an appeal for the President and Congress to set up a task force to
examine the entire petroleum industry.
   The plan urged the administration to assign highest priority to
antitrust investigations to determine whether the current energy
crisis is due to deliberate attempts to manipulate the market.
   It also called upon the oil industry to exercise voluntary
restraint and to be candid in their public statements about rising
oil prices.
   The attorneys general demanded effective federal legislation on
price-gouging and creation of an energy scams task force to crack
down on those who exploit consumers during periods of price
instability.
   President Bush last week urged oil companies to hold down costs
to consumers and several major companies temporarily froze or
lowered prices.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday the
administration was pleased with Saudi Arabia's intention to boost
its oil production in an effort to ward off shortages.
   ``Overall, we believe we have reached a reasonably stable
situation,'' he said.
   The attorneys general said their states were warning citizens
about investment scams or come-ons for low-cost heating devices.
New York Attorney General Robert Abrams said ``a lot of people have
had their life savings taken from them'' during past energy crises.

   Auto industry labor negotiations intensify this
week as two of the Big Three automakers plan to offer comprehensive
contract proposals to the United Auto Workers union.
   Spokesmen for General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. said
Monday their companies would give the UAW their initial, detailed
contract proposals to replace agreements that expire Sept. 14.
   Lee Sechler, a spokesman for Chrysler Corp., said he knew of no
timing for such a proposal being offered by his company.
   For the past month, bargainers for the UAW and the Big Three
have been meeting in subcommittees focused on specific contract
issues. Results of those discussions will show up in the companies'
initial detailed proposals.
   Part of the UAW's reaction to the suggested contracts will show
up early next week when the union is expected to choose a target
company for this year's talks. If things go according to the
union's plan, a contract reached with the target company will be a
pattern for agreements at the other two companies.
   GM Vice President and chief negotiator Alfred Warren said his
company's offer will be made late in the week. A Ford spokesman,
who declined to be identified, said his company's was due Thursday.
   Contracts covering more than 450,000 active employees at the Big
Three expire Sept. 14.
   UAW President Owen Bieber is making the rounds this week,
meeting with top-level company negotiators and reminding them there
are less than four weeks remaining in the current agreements.
   He visited with Warren on Monday and has sessions at Ford on
Wednesday and Chrysler on Thursday.
   ``I had hoped that they would have had a proposal out by this
time,'' Bieber said Monday morning after meeting with Warren. ``It
hasn't been forthcoming. I expect we'll see one in the next few
days, (which) ought to be one that is not a starter proposal.''
   Later in the morning, Warren fulfilled that wish.
   ``I think this week we will manage to put forth a proposal,'' he
said. ``We have spent our time on putting together a whole set of
options.''
   One of the things that the company has been looking at is the
settlement a week ago today of a six-day strike at GM's AC
Rochester West parts plant in Flint. That agreement, ratified by a
93 percent vote, contains job-guarantee language for the plant's
employees for the next six years.
   Job security has been tapped as the top UAW priority in this set
of negotiations.
   ``Make no mistake about it, this company nor any other company
can survive, prosper, move forward unless they've got the good will
of those workers behind them,'' Bieber said.
   ``I think that situation there tells them how to get it. They
need it just as Ford and Chrysler need it,'' he said.
   Warren agreed that the ratification margin was impressive.
   ``I think the vote itself was encouraging and we're certainly
studying it,'' he said. ``One factor that comes out of it is the
people were pleased with the settlement.''
   Meantime, The Detroit News said in today's editions that
bargaining between the UAW and Chrysler is going slowly, mainly
because of company-proposed changes in health-care coverage.
   ``The company doesn't want to give nothing, everything's a
takeaway,'' a UAW member who declined to be identified told the
News. Another UAW source, who also declined to be identified, said
Bieber will find little progress has been made when he visits
Chrysler on Thursday.
   ``He's dropping by to get an update on where we're at,'' the
second source said. ``We're probably going to report to him that
we're nowhere.''

<TEXT>
   All Nippon Airways Co. Ltd. of Japan has ordered
17 more Boeing 747-400s in a deal valued at $3.5 billion including
parts and related equipment, the aerospace company says.
   Delivery of the aircraft, the largest passenger jetliners in the
world, is scheduled to begin in 1995 and continue over five years,
according to Monday's announcement.
   ANA plans to use the aircraft on international routes and on
domestic flights in Japan.
   The order brings to 43 the number of ANA's outstanding B747-400
orders.
   The aircraft will be powered by General Electric CF6-80C2
engines.
   ANA is the largest carrier in Japan and the eighth largest in
the world, carrying almost 30 million passengers in 1989, the
airline said. The airline said it is still in the market for about
30 aircraft in the 400-seat range, and is considering the Boeing
777, Mcdonnell-Douglas MD-11 and the Airbus A330 and A340.
   Boeing Commercial Airplane Group spokesman Tom Cole said Monday
the latest order was for options, which means they could be
canceled later, but All Nippon did not mention the option factor in
its news release.

   Stock prices fell sharply in early, heavy
trading today after a poor showing for U.S. shares overseas amid
continued concern about the Mideast.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 47.77 points to
2,608.66 in the first half hour of trading.
   In the broader market, declining stocks outnumbered advancing
ones by about 6 to 1 in the overall tally of New York Stock
Exchange-listed issues, with 161 up, 979 down and 273 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to a strong 30.64 million shares as
of 10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   The sharp drop in the Dow triggered one of the NYSE's ``circuit
breakers'' designed to prevent a price freefall. The mechanism, set
off by a 50-point Dow drop, bars sales connected to index-futures
arbitrage until the prices of the stocks invovlved rise.
   Analysts said the market was hurt by a decline in the price of
U.S. shares on foreign exchanges before the start of New York
trading.
   Stock prices fell sharply in Frankfurt, primarily to a rumor _
later dismissed _ that a U.S. plane was shot down over Iraq. Share
prices also were sharply lower in midday London trading.
   Earlier, share prices slipped for the fourth consecutive session
in Tokyo, where the key Nikkei index lost 0.73 percent.
   The U.S. stock market also was hurt by a drop in bond prices
this morning, analysts said. But market-watchers said they expected
stock prices to be most affected by any news from Iraq.
   Among most-active blue-chip issues in early trading, General
Electric fell 2 to 62, Philip Morris lost 1\ to 43|, Boeing slipped
1~ to 46| and AT&amp;T fell 1 to 32}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 3.07 to 177.35. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 1.73 at 329.56.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 11.64 to
2,656.44.
   But declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 2 on the
NYSE, with 622 up, 915 down and 461 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 129.63 million shares, against 212.56
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Document Shows 11 Investigations Against Northrop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government abandoned 11 criminal probes
against Northrop Corp. in exchange for the company's guilty pleas
in a defense fraud case, according to secret documents unsealed by
a federal judge.
   The plea agreement was ``certainly no giveaway,'' Assistant U.S.
Attorney William Fahey said Monday. Each of the investigations was
conducted at least three years, he said.
   ``We determined that either the cases were beyond the statute of
limitations or that we had determined there was insufficient
evidence of criminal fraud,'' he said.
   The aerospace giant plead guilty in February to 34 counts of
fraud involving the cruise missile and Harrier jet contracts. The
company agreed to pay a $17 million fine, one of the most
substantial against a defense contractor.
   The exhibits were unsealed Monday by U.S. District Judge Pamela
Ann Rymer after a request by the Los Angeles Times and Wall Street
Journal.
   Some of the criminal allegations that were dropped included:
   _ Mischarging in 1983 on production of a guidance component on
the MX missile. Fahey said the statute of limitations passed in
1988.
   _ Improper testing of a ``heat exchanger'' component in the MX.
   _ Pricing misconduct in a research report concerning the B-2
stealth bomber, and mischarging by the B-2 division.
   _ Failure to inform the government about a cost-saving process
for making parts for the FA-18 fighter. Fahey said a civil suit
seeking millions of dollars in damages has been filed by the
government.
   _ Unspecified allegations carried in a Dec. 18, 1987 Defense
Contract Audit Agency report regarding two secret programs.
   _ Fraud regarding development of a small intercontinental
ballistic missile or ICBM. Fahey said the case was settled for
about $40,000.
   A section of the exhibits referring to ongoing investigations
was inked over, making it impossible to read.

   The jury that convicted three former pilots
of flying a jetliner while under the influence of alcohol reasoned
they were drunk because they didn't have the sense to heed a
federal inspector's warning not to fly.
   ``If they weren't concerned about the passengers' lives, they
should have at least been thinking about their own careers,'' said
jury forewoman Ruth Boylan.
   The jury deliberated three days before finding the former
Northwest Airlines pilots guilty Monday in the first test of a 1986
federal law aimed at cracking down on alcohol and drug use on
commercial transportation.
   The pilots flew a Boeing 727 with 91 passengers from Fargo,
N.D., to Minneapolis after Federal Aviation Administration
inspector Verle Addison, tipped off to their heavy drinking the
night before, met them at the Fargo departure gate and warned them
not to fly.
   ``If they had heeded Mr. Addison's warning and just said, `Hey,
if there's questions we'll call Northwest and get another cockpit
crew,''' Boylan said. ``None of them showed that judgment.''
   Convicted of operating a jetliner while intoxicated were Capt.
Norman Lyle Prouse, 51, of Conyers, Ga.; 1st Officer Robert
Kirchner, 36, of Highland Ranch, Colo., and flight engineer Joseph
Balzer, 35, of Antioch, Tenn.
   The offense carries up to 15 years in prison and a $250,000
fine. No sentencing date was set. The defendants were freed without
bail.
   According to testimony, the pilots went to a lounge the night
before the early morning flight March 8, where Balzer and Kirchner
shared six pitchers of beer. Prouse had 15 to 20 rum and Diet Cokes
and fell on his way out of the bar, according to testimony.
   Two hours after their arrest, tests showed Prouse with a
blood-alcohol level of 0.13 percent; Balzer 0.08 percent, and
Kirchner 0.06 percent. The legal limit for driving in most states
is .10 percent.
   The 1986 law suggests that a person with a blood-alcohol content
of 0.10 percent would be impaired. But the law does not define
drunkenness with a specific blood-alcohol level.
   U.S. District Judge James Rosenbaum told the jury it had to
decide whether the pilots were so impaired that they lacked
``clearness of intellect'' and their usual control.
   Defense lawyers argued that the smoothness of the 40-minute
flight proved the pilots were not impaired and that Prouse was an
alcoholic with a high tolerance for alcohol. But Assistant U.S.
Attorney Elizabeth de la Vega questioned whether they could have
handled an emergency.
   De la Vega said she won despite the lack of trouble with the
flight because ``as a matter of common sense people know that
someone can be under the influence and not show it at all.''
   After the verdict, many people, including the prosecutor, called
for toughening the law. De la Vega suggested a limit of 0.04
percent.
   Addison had testified he smelled alcohol on the pilots' breath
at the gate. He said he wondered aloud if they had violated the FAA
rule against drinking within eight hours of a flight.
   Addison, who had no authority to stop the flight, warned Prouse
there would be no violation if the plane stayed where it was. The
plane left while Addison was on the telephone seeking further
instructions from a superior. After the plane landed at
Minneapolis, another FAA official made a citizen's arrest.
   William Mauzy, Kirchner's lawyer, said he would appeal. Peter
Wold, attorney for Prouse, said he was considering an appeal. Bruce
Hanley, attorney for Balzer, did not comment.
   Northwest fired the pilots for violating company policy by
drinking within 12 hours of a flight, and the FAA revoked their
licenses.
   Balzer said he will fight to regain his license. ``It's kind of
hard to keep a good pilot on the ground,'' he said. ``That's kind
of like asking Picasso if he were going to paint again.''
   Prouse said he is not hopeful of flying again. ``I came in
expecting the worst,'' he said.

   Stocks plunged and oil prices surged to new
highs this morning in markets preoccupied with the rapid military
escalation in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled from
the opening bell and was down about 77 points to the 2,580 level by
late morning. Broader indicators of stock prices also dropped.
   Petroleum traders said the energy market was especially
susceptible to war rumors from the Middle East, where the United
States and Iraq seemed to be moving toward a hostile confrontation
over Iraq's seizure of Kuwait Aug. 2.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price of unleaded
gasoline shot up to $1.06 per gallon for September delivery, 4{
cents higher than a record set on Monday.
   The September contract price of benchmark light sweet crude oil
rose 14 cents per 42-gallon barrel to $28.70 by midmorning today
after dipping 7 cents on Monday. Contracts for later months all
rose, suggesting that traders believe a long siege in the Persian
Gulf will cause major supply problems.

<HEAD>Stock Plunge Weighs on Grain and Soybean Futures</HEAD>

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened lower
this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   ``The stock market opened with a huge plunge, signaling possibly
the onset of a recession, which the grains view negatively,'' said
Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   But even before the stocks started to plunge, the Board of Trade
markets were under pressure.
   Follow-through selling from Monday's weak close undercut the
opening of soybean trading.
   And despite some concern about an early frost and too much rain
in the Midwest, the weekly USDA report late Monday showed the corn
and soybean crops both doing fairly well, said Karlin.
   Analysts say the lack of export demand also is weighing on the
markets, particularly wheat.
   In early trading, wheat futures prices were 1} cents lower to {
cent higher with the September contract at $2.79{ a bushel; corn
was \ cent to } cent lower with September at $2.52 a bushel; oats
were unchanged to { cent lower with September at $1.16 a bushel;
and soybeans were unchanged to 2\ cents lower with August at $6.08{
a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle futures were .37 cent to .60 cent lower with the
October contract at 76.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .45
cent lower to .05 cent higher with August at 89.30 cents a pound;
live hogs were .32 cent to .82 cent lower with October at 49.25
cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were 1.45 cent to the limit
2 cents lower with August at 47.72 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures on Monday were mostly lower while the pork
complex was mostly higher.

<HEAD>Tender Offer for Kansas Gas Extended</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co. said
Tuesday it had extended its $857 million tender offer for Kansas
Gas and Electric Co. stock until Sept. 14, saying that about 43
percent of KG&amp;E shares had been tendered.
   Kansas City Power said that about 13.7 million of KG&amp;E's 31.7
million outstanding shares had been tendered as of the previous
deadline of midnight Monday.
   KG&amp;E, based in Wichita, opposes the tender offer, calling it
illegal and inadequate. The company has declined to call a special
shareholders' meeting requested by Kansas City Power.
   The bid is the first hostile takeover attempt in the electric
utility industry, and some industry analysts believe it could have
implications for other utilities.
   Kansas City Power is seeking 90 percent of the KG&amp;E stock for
$27 a share. The offer began July 23 and represented a 37 percent
premium over the market price of KG&amp;E stock on the last trading day
before the offer.
   ``This confirms the strength of our offer. ... There are just a
lot of people saying this makes sense. It's just a stronger offer,
and people are saying it's a strong offer,'' Kansas City Power
spokesman Turner White said.
   Lyle Koerper, a KG&amp;E spokesman, said his company was not
surprised by the extension of the tender offer or the number of
shares tendered.
   ``Last week we said we would review all options to KCPL's
unprecedented action, including remaining independent,'' he said.
   KG&amp;E said last week it had asked its financial adviser to search
out alternatives to the takeover bid. Industry experts have
speculated that other utilities in the region might want to acquire
the Wichita company under terms more favorable to KG&amp;E management
and stockholders.
   Whatever the outcome of the tender offer, some business experts
say, KCPL still has an uphill struggle to win regulatory approval
for a takeover of KG&amp;E.

   Stock prices fell sharply in heavy trading this
morning as the market continued to worry about the prospect of war
in the Mideast, traders said.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was down 40.85
points to 2,615.59 as of noon on Wall Street.
   In the broader market, declining stocks outnumbered advancing
ones by about 10 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 140 up,
1,429 down and 274 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to a strong 117.02 million shares
as of midday.
   Traders said the main force on the market was continuing concern
about the Iraqi situation.
   ``Everyone's just very, very nervous here,'' said Tony Woodruff,
a managing director at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   A speech this morning by Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, did
little to calm the market, Woodruff said.
   Saddam said the holding of hostages by Iraq was justified given
the aggressive response by foreign nations to Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait. Saddam also said that if the United States continues its
aggression, ``a disaster will take place concerning the whole
world.''
   Woodruff said the continuing rise in oil prices due to the
Mideast tension is of particular concern to the market. Wholesale
unleaded gasoline prices hit a new high on the New York Mercantile
Exchange for the fifth day in a row this morning.
   The plunge in the Dow triggered one of the NYSE's ``circuit
breakers'' designed to prevent a price freefall. The mechanism, set
off by a 50-point Dow drop, bars sales connected to index-futures
arbitrage until the prices of the stocks invovlved rise.
   Analysts said the market also was hurt by losses on overseas
exchanges.
   Stock prices fell sharply in Frankfurt, primarily due to a rumor
_ later dismissed _ that a U.S. plane was shot down over Iraq.
Share prices also were lower in London trading.
   Earlier, share prices slipped for the fourth consecutive session
in Tokyo, where the key Nikkei index lost 0.73 percent.
   The U.S. stock market also was weakened by a drop in bond prices
this morning, analysts said.
   Among most-active blue-chip issues, General Electric fell 2\ to
61}, Philip Morris lost 1} to 43&lsqb;, Boeing slipped 3 to 45{, IBM
dropped 2 to 100\ and AT&amp;T fell 1&lsqb; to 32|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 3.09 to 177.33. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 3.94 at 327.35.

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state casino board today approved
a financial bailout plan for developer Donald Trump, staving off
what his lawyers said last week could have been the collapse of his
empire.
   In a uninimous vote, the Casino Control Commission granted Trump
permission to use his three Atlantic City gaming halls as
collateral for a $65 million bank loan that is the center of the
bailout.
   Trump attended the half-hour meeting, staring straight ahead,
unsmiling and with his lips pursed, even as the plan was approved.
   ``This is a big hurdle and I'm happy,'' Trump told a throng of
reporters and camera crews. ``Maybe you can focus on someone else
now.''
   During hearings last week, Trump's attorneys told the commission
that rejection of the plan, or even a delay of more than a week or
so, could topple the first domino in the celebrity developer's
casino, airline and real estate empire.
   Although the vote to approve was 5-0, commissioner W. David
Waters said he was concerned because the commission had not looked
into greater detail at Trump's casino debt.
   Acting Commission Chairwoman Valerie Armstrong said Trump would
have to return sometime in October for a hearing on the overall
financial stability of his casinos and other holdings.
   ``I do not view this restructuring as the total solution to the
problem,'' Armstrong said. ``We must hold a full financial
stability hearing as soon as possible.''
   The loan allowed Trump to make an overdue $43 million bond
payment in June on the Trump Castle casino.
   Earlier, the state Division of Gaming Enforcement had
reluctantly endorsed the plan but criticized the debt-heavy state
of Trump's casinos. The division added provisos to the plan
requiring that Trump return three weeks from now with details of
how he plans to make a $47 million bond payment due Nov. 15 on his
new Taj Mahal Casino Resort.
   Trump is expected to return with a proposal to swap some of his
$3.2 billion in debt for equity, sell assets _ perhaps the poorly
performing Trump Shuttle airline _ or negotiate reduced or deferred
interest rates.
   Ed Tracy, president of Trump's three casinos and one non-casino
hotel here, said the commission's decision to postpone ruling on
the matter until today did not cause problems with the banks.
   Claridge Casino Hotel president Roger Wagner said Monday that
Trump's stated desire to keep all three casinos would prove
difficult.
   ``I think he would like to do that,'' Wagner said. ``But maybe
that is a positioning he has to do to keep the value up.''
   Wagner, who stayed at the Claridge after an April offer to
become president at Trump Castle, said there might not be much of a
market for the casinos because of a stagnant gaming market overall.
   He said the April 2 opening of the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort
hamstrung Trump by further taxing his already strained resources.

<HEAD>Circle K Closing 201 Stores</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Circle K Corp. has begun closing 201 stores
targeted as unprofitable and will complete the job by the end of
the month, company spokesman Ray Cox said.
   More closings are possible after the effects of the step are
analyzed, he said Monday.
   About 1,600 employees in 21 states will be affected, but 95
percent of them will be moved to other stores, Cox said. Most of
the stores are concentrated in Texas, California, Georgia and
Florida.
   He would not say how much the closings were expected to save, or
how much it would cost to terminate the leases.
   Analysts said they doubted that 200 closings would suffice to
pull the company from the protection of U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
where it filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors May 15.
   The company determined which stores to close mainly by gross
sales and profitability figures, Cox said. But other factors,
including traffic counts and neighborhood deterioration, also were
taken into account.
   ``They're probably closing all the leases they can get out of
easily,'' said Dennis Telzrow, an analyst with Eppler, Guerin &amp;
Turner in Dallas.
   Circle K's latest move follows the recent termination of 400
leases on stores that had been shut down. Those leases were
estimated to cost the company $1 million to $1.5 million a month.
   The company also had deals to sell 375 stores in Hawaii and the
Pacific Northwest before its Chapter 11 filing. The deals have been
delayed pending court approval.
   Circle K operates about 4,500 convenience stores in 32 states
and has an additional 1,300 licensed or joint-venture stores in 14
foreign countries.
   Other states where stores will be closed include Arizona,
Louisiana, Oklahoma, Colorado, Mississippi, Alabama, New Mexico,
North Carolina, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Tennessee,
Kentucky, Missouri, Montana and South Carolina.

   China's economy is sluggish, verging on
recession, but exports are booming.
   Foreign investment has lagged since the brutal crackdown on
dissent more than a year ago. Businessmen still worry about
political instability and are put off by numerous roadblocks to
profitable joint ventures.
   ``Trade is the bright spot in the Chinese economy,'' a Western
diplomat said, on condition of anonymity. ``If the current trend
keeps up, this year's may be the biggest trade surplus in China's
history.''
   Total trade rose 8.6 percent in 1989 to $111.5 billion. From
January through June this year, the $25.65 billion in exports
exceeded imports by $2.56 billion. Economists predict a $10 billion
surplus for 1990, nearly double the record 1982 surplus of $5.63
billion.
   More industries produce goods for export because economic
problems have shrunk domestic markets. Economists say China also is
pushing exports in order to repay foreign loans, many of which are
due in 1992.
   Led by its freewheeling southern coastal provinces, China is
exporting more to the United States than ever before, despite
international censure of the harsh action against pro-democracy
demonstrators in June 1989.
   Exports to the United States rose 43 percent last year to $11.99
billion, according to U.S. Commerce Department figures. President
Bush's decision in May of this year to continue most-favored-nation
status eliminated a major threat to the growing trade.
   Japan has not cashed in on the boom, even though it has moved
faster than other industrialized nations to ease sanctions imposed
on Beijing after the army assault on Tiananmen Square.
   China's exports to Japan fell 3.5 percent to $3.43 billion in
the first half of 1990 and imports from Japan plunged 39.9 percent
to $3.22 billion. Total trade between the two fell 5 percent in
1989 from the previous year.
   ``Japanese businessmen were discouraged by Tiananmen,'' said
Nobuo Maruyama, senior economist at the Institute of Developing
Economies in Tokyo.
   After more than a decade of investing in China and waiting, he
said, the Japanese are turning to other Asian nations with cheap
labor, such as India, Indonesia and the Philippines.
   According to the Western diplomat, Japanese businessmen ``aren't
terribly enthusiastic about China as a place to invest, or to
trade, since exports have fallen due to import restrictions.
They've become hard-nosed about doing business here.''
   Japanese investors express the same concerns about China as
about the Soviet Union: Joint ventures can find little hard
currency to buy imports and factories face shortages of electricity
and raw materials, despite recent orders that special help be given
to foreign-financed companies.
   Economic austerity measures China imposed in late 1988 to curb
inflation caused the domestic market to shrink.
   The pall cast by the military crackdown and fears of future
instability further dampened foreign enthusiasm, and investment in
China fell 14.7 percent in 1989 to $1.85 billion, according to
Chinese estimates.
   Late last year, Political and Economic Risk Consultancy Ltd. of
Hong Kong issued an evaluation for 1990 that pronounced China by
far the riskiest for foreign investment of 10 Asian nations,
including the coup-prone Philippines.
   After pointing to corruption, red tape and the potential for
unrest, it said:
   ``Only investors with a long-term view of profit-making that
takes into account huge potential short- and medium-term pitfalls
should consider a large commitment of capital at this time.''
   Investors willing to take the risk favor China's southern and
coastal provinces, which have thousands of factories financed from
nearby Hong Kong.
   ``These areas have been incorporated into the world economy, and
technological and managerial innovation are seeping in,'' the
diplomat said.
   ``Five or six years ago, Guangdong had a bad problem with
quality. Now it's the preferred source for quality and on-time
delivery, even when wages are higher than in Thailand.''
   Japanese companies, with a labor shortage at home, increasingly
use assembly plants along the Chinese coast that require minimal
investment and training, said Maruyama, the Tokyo economist.
   ``Smaller Japanese firms making labor-intensive, low-cost items
like tableware, compact cameras, pajamas and baby clothes are
staying in business by producing in China,'' he said. ``Long-term
joint ventures are too risky. They only want to use the labor
power.''
   One investment bright spot comes from Taiwan, whose businessmen
seek factory sites abroad because of rapidly rising costs and
pollution concerns at home.
   Taiwanese invested an estimated $550 million in China last year,
replacing Japan as the third-ranked foreign investor after Hong
Kong and the United States.
   Beijing has established special investment zones with
concessionary terms for Taiwanese in Fujian province, across a
narrow strait from the island, and in Guangdong.

<HEAD>Wang Receives Largest Contract in Company History</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wang Laboratories Inc., plagued by losses for more
than a year, announced Tuesday it has received a government
contract worth up to $841 million _ the largest in the computer
maker's history.
   Under the contract, Wang will provide a wide range of computers,
software and other services for the U.S. State Department during
the next five years.
   The $841 million estimate is based on the State Department's
projected needs during the five-year period.
   ``It certainly is a very significant hunk of business,'' said
Frank Ryan, a spokesman for the Lowell, Mass.-based company.
   More important, he said, the contract reflects confidence in the
company, which has been working feverishly to try to turn around
its fortunes. The company lost $715 million in its last fiscal year
and has eliminated more than 8,000 jobs. Wang announced last month
it would cut another 1,000 jobs.
   The government contract will not change the company's plans to
cut its payroll, Ryan said.
   Wang, like other Massachusetts companies, has been hurt by a
decline in the market for mid-size computers. Richard Miller, who
took over as company president last August and was named chairman
this year when founder An Wang died, has tried to revamp the
company's products and cut costs.
   Wang officials said the company's efforts to build a
relationship with the State Department helped provide an edge.
   ``Wang has worked closely with the U.S. foreign affairs
community for more than a decade,'' said Eugene Shugoll, vice
president of Wang's federal systems division.
   While the contract will add to the company's revenue, Wang could
use another major deal to show nervous customers that the State
Department contract was not a fluke, said Marc Schulman, an analyst
with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
   Aside from the State Department, other foreign affairs agencies
will be eligible to buy computers from Wang under the contract
announced Tuesday. They include the U.S. Agency for International
Development, the U.S. Information Agency and the Foreign
Agricultural Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
   The contract is the second positive development for
Massachusetts' slumping computer industry. Prime Computer Inc.,
based in Natick, recently landed $180 million worth of business as
part of an Army contract. That was the largest contract in Prime's
history.

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The majority shareholders in King Broadcasting
Co. said Tuesday they plan to sell the privately held radio and
television company.
   King owns six television stations in the Northwest and Hawaii,
six radio stations in Seattle, Portland, Ore., and San Francisco,
and 13 cable television systems in Washington, Idaho, California
and Minnesota.
   Priscilla Bullitt Collins, chairman of King's board, and her
sister Harriet Stimson Bullitt, chairman of the executive
committee, said they intended to concentrate on preserving the
environment in the Northwest.
   ``In part because of our age (we have both passed our 65th
birthdays) we prefer to sell at a time of our own choosing rather
than wait until a sale would be required by our deaths,'' the
sisters said in a news release.
   They said they have retained Dillon, Read &amp; Co. and Sterling
Payot Co. to advise them on the sale.
   The sisters said their stock along with that of their late
mother, Dorothy Bullitt, make up about 70 percent of the privately
held company's shares.
   The Puget Sound Business Journal has estimated King's 1988
annual revenues at about $150 million and said King has
approximately 1,200 employees.
   The Seattle Times quoted the media reserach firm Paul Kagan
Associates as saying that NBC affiliate KING-TV has a market value
of about $150 million. The entire company is valued at more than
$400 million, the Times said.
   The sisters said they intend to work through the Bullitt
Foundation to enhance environmental quality in the Northwest.
   King's properties include television stations KING, Seattle;
KGW, Portland; KREM, Spokane; KTVB, Boise, Idaho; K38AS, Twin
Falls, Idaho; and KHNL, Honolulu. Its radio stations are KING-AM
and KING-FM in Seattle, KINK-FM and KGW-AM in Portland and KSFO-AM
and KYA-FM in San Francisco.
   The company owns cable systems in Brooklyn Park and St. Croix,
Minn.; Los Angeles, Santa Clarita, Riverside County, Lodi,
Placerville, San Andreas, Mammoth Lakes and Mount Shasta, Calif.;
Twin Falls and American Falls, Idaho; and Ellensburg, Wash. In all,
the systems have more than 200,000 subscribers.
   King also owns Northwest Mobile Television, the nation's largest
mobile production company.
   Dorothy Bullitt, who died last year at age 97, founded King when
she bought a struggling Seattle radio station in 1946 and renamed
it KING. In 1948, she bought 8-month-old KRSC-TV and subsequently
renamed it KING-TV.

<HEAD>MCI May Take $500 Million Charge For Modernization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MCI Communications Corp. said Tuesday it was
considering a writedown of $500 million to $550 million this
quarter to cover the cost of replacing old analog equipment with
digital gear.
   The move came as the No. 2 long-distance phone company announced
plans to install a fully digital network by the end of next year at
a cost of $1.1 billion.
   The plan includes the integration of 3,000 miles of optical
fiber lines acquired when MCI purchased Telecom USA Inc. earlier
this year. It also includes an agreement with Williams Cos. Inc. of
Tulsa, Okla., for an interchange in each other's phone systems.
   Terms of the Williams deal were not disclosed.
   Both companies said the interchange agreement would allow them
to save substantial amounts of capital investment over the next few
years.
   MCI and Telecom USA have been the second and fourth largest
customers for Williams' fiber-optic phone system, WilTel, which
sells access to its lines to long-distance companies.
   The agreement will allow WilTel to serve a large number of
cities, using the MCI network, than it does now, Williams officials
said.
   Digital phone systems transmit calls in computer language,
providing clearer reception and greater capacity than traditional
analog systems.
   MCI earned $177 million in the second quarter on revenue of
$1.86 billion. A write-down of assets could hurt earnings, but MCI
did not speculate what that impact could be.

   Anxiety over the Gulf crisis drove share prices
down again Tuesday on the London Stock Exchange.
   Sharp early falls on Wall Street hit the London market late in
the day after jittery trading, which was hurt by unfounded rumors
that a U.S. jet had been shot down over Iraq.
   As stock markets across Europe were also unsettled, investors
were not in a buying mood, dealers said.
   At the close, the broad-based Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100

<HEAD>AMR Eagle to Order 100 Large Commuter Planes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AMR Corp.'s regional subsidiary, AMR
Eagle, is expected to announce Wednesday that it will order 100
large commuter airplanes in a deal worth $800 million.
   Company spokesman Ed Martelle declined to discuss details of the
transaction. But several industry sources said AMR Eagle will order
or take options on at least 100 aircraft made by a joint venture
between France and Italy's primary aerospace manufacturing
companies.
   Officials of AMR Eagle, which operates the nation's largest
commuter airline network, the American Eagle system, were expected
to announce the deal at a news conference Wednesday at AMR's
headquarters in Fort Worth.
   Called ATR, the joint venture between France's Aerospatiale and
Italy's Aeritalia produces two turboprop-powered commuter
airliners, the ATR-42 and the ATR-72.
   Aerospatiale and Aeritalia recently acquired Boeing's Canadian
commuter airplane manufacturing subsidiary, de Havilland of Canada.
   Sources said they expect most or all of the planes being ordered
by AMR Eagle to be ATR-42s, a 42-seat twin-engine turboprop.
   Paul Turk, an analyst with Avmark Inc., a Washington consulting
firm, said the ATR-42 has a sticker price of about $9.5 million.
   AMR Eagle owns five of the six operating companies that fly
under the American Eagle name. Together, the six American Eagle
operations form the largest commuter airline in the nation, with
1,500 daily flights to 150 cities. American is the nation's largest
airline, with 525 planes and orders or options for more than 500
additional big jets.

cut by more than 20 percent under a reduction agreement reached
between the country and creditor banks, Venezuelan officials
announced Tuesday.
   The deal covers $20.5 billion of this oil-producing nation's $26
billion public-sector debt. The country owes about $35 billion in
public- and private- sector debt.
   Cutting the debt has been a major goal of the 19-month-old
government of President Carlos Andres Perez. He has said
consistently that this once-wealthy nation is now too poor to pay
on loans contracted over two decades of boom times.
   Debt-cutting negotiations began early last year under the
umbrella of U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's plan to ease
the burden of Third World nations.
   Officials said more than 90 percent of a total 400 creditor
banks have chosen from a list of five debt-cutting options offered
by Venezuela.
   The most popular options were the exchange of Venezuelan debt
for low-interest, 30-year U.S.-guaranteed bonds, and the loaning of
fresh funds to Venezuela.
   Least popular was the option that Venezuela had pushed the
hardest: allowing Venezuela to buy back debt on the secondary
market at about 41 percent of its value.
   Although one option allows banks to recapture more funds if the
price of oil rises, officials said the income earned from high oil
prices would far outweigh possible givebacks to the banks.

   Ted Turner is about to take his first step into
the world of book publishing, but not with the role of giant slayer
this time.
   Turner Publishing Inc. is getting started as a modest venture
with little of the brashness that has accompanied other Turner
projects, such as the launch 10 years ago of Cable News Network.
   ``We don't have any intention of becoming a Random House or
Simon &amp; Schuster. Publishing is not the main business of TBS, and
it never will be,'' said Michael Reagan, vice president and
publisher of Turner Publishing.
   But Reagan is hoping the publishing unit will cut itself a
comfortable niche by utilizing Turner's cable television empire to
generate interest in the book titles.
   Turner Publishing, a wholly owned subsidiary of Turner
Broadcasting System Inc., puts its first book, a coffee-table
volume of Reagan's photographs, on the market next month. The book,
``Portrait of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,'' is tied to a
TBS mini-series.
   Most of what follows also will be tied to TBS television
programming, especially the company's vast movie library. Set for a
Valentine's Day release is ``Kisses,'' a photo collection of silver
screen smooches ranging from Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh in ``Gone
Withpside is that there's not a lot of expectations,'' he
said. ``I don't think anyone expects us to make a profit right
away.''
   But, Reagan added, ``We have to prove ourselves financially. ...
As time goes by, the burden will be on us to make a profit.''
   Low expectations are probably a good thing, considering the
recent slump in some segments of the publishing industry.
   Several industry giants, including Simon &amp; Schuster and Harcourt
Brace Jovanovich, took writedowns in the past year. Competition for
best-sellers has driven up the advances commanded by some
well-known writers. Some companies have taken on debt to buy other
companies and have been forced to watch other costs more closely to
meet repayment obligations.
   Analysts say Turner's relatively small investment in the book
unit minimizes its risk.
   ``It's such a small part of the company,'' said Mary L.
Kukowski, who follows TBS for Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. Inc. in New York.
``A lot of what Turner does is interesting, but this is not
important in terms of what moves the stock.''
   Turner Publishing evolved from the TBS chairman's creation of
the Turner Tomorrow Award, in which a $500,000 prize is offered for
a novel that addresses positive solutions to global problems.
   The award carries a promise to publish the winning manuscript
and, Reagan said, ``it became apparent we'd need a publishing
company.''
   Reagan said the publishing venture was a natural, given the TV
material in the TBS archives with potential for transfer into book
form, as well as the company's existing marketing and promotion
machinery.
   ``If you spend $2 million doing mini-series or a documentary,
all that research is already being done. It's not much more money
to add a book to that mix,'' said Reagan, who is not related to the
former president.
   Also ripe for mining are the 3,700 movies Turner owns, mainly as
a result of its $1.3 billion purchase of the MGM film library four
years ago. In addition to ``Kisses,'' a retrospective of ``Outlaws,
Rebels and Rogues'' is planned as well as projects based on the
film classics ``Citizen Kane'' and ``Casablanca.''
   Reagan said he expects the movie-oriented books to have more
mass appeal than those tied to the documentaries. For example,
``Kisses,'' a joint venture with Citadel Press, will have a first
printing of 50,000 copies, while ``Portrait of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland'' will ship 20,000.
   Reagan, who joined TBS in 1985 and worked on the ``Portrait of
America'' and ``Portrait of the World'' series, also has taken
photographs for a book on Cuba. But once that volume is completed,
he said, he will concentrate on his executive duties.
   ``What we're trying to do is break some ground on the idea of
what a tie-in is,'' Reagan said. ``In the past, (publishers would)
take a screenplay and novelize it, or slap a star's face on the
cover. This has nothing to do with a script. It's a tie-in in the
broadest possible sense.''

   Stock prices fell sharply in heavy trading today
as investors continued to worry about the prospect of war in the
Mideast.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was down 49.51
points to 2,606.93 as of 3 p.m. EDT on Wall Street.
   In the broader market, declining stocks outnumbered advancing
ones by about 7 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 202 up,
1,450 down and 326 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to a brisk 172.06 million shares
with an hour of trading remaining.
   Traders said the main influence on the market was continuing
concern about the Iraqi situation.
   ``Everyone's just very, very nervous here,'' said Tony Woodruff,
a managing director at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   In a speech this morning, Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, said
his nation's detention of foreigners was justified given the
aggressive response by foreign nations to Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait. Saddam also said that if the United States continues its
aggression, ``a disaster will take place concerning the whole
world.''
   Woodruff said the continuing rise in oil prices due to the
Mideast tension is of particular concern to the market.
   Analysts said the market also was hurt by losses on overseas
exchanges.
   Stock prices fell sharply in Frankfurt, primarily due to a rumor
_ later dismissed _ that a U.S. plane was shot down over Iraq.
Share prices also closed sharply lower in London trading. Earlier,
prices slipped for the fourth consecutive session in Tokyo.
   The Dow twice plunged more than 50 points, each time triggering
one of the NYSE's ``circuit breakers'' designed to prevent a price
freefall. The mechanism bars stock sales connected to index-futures
arbitrage until the prices of the stocks involved rise.
   Among most-active blue-chip issues today, General Electric fell
2&lsqb; to 61~, Philip Morris lost 1\ to 43|, Boeing slipped 2\ to 46\,
IBM dropped 2 to 100\ and AT&amp;T fell 1 to 32}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 3.35 to 177.07. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 4.07 at 327.22.

<HEAD>Data General Could Cut More Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Data General Corp., which has already cut its work
force by about one-third, may slash its payroll further to help end
a string of losses, analysts said Tuesday.
   Employment at Data General has shrunk to 11,700, down from
17,700 in 1985, the last year the company reported a profit. One of
the biggest thorns for the company has been its line of mid-size
computers, whose market has declined as smaller computers grow more
powerful.
   Data General has been pushing a line of workstations, which are
powerful desktop machines, to help reverse the company's slide.
It's also been making products that conform to industry standards.
   Nonetheless, Data General is still struggling with weak
revenues. For the first nine months of the current fiscal year, the
company had revenues of $907 million, compared with $957 million a
year ago.
   ``We are committed to taking whatever steps are necessary to
become profitable,'' said James Dunlap, a spokesman for Westboro,
Mass.-based computer maker. ``We are looking at all options that
would allow us to cut costs. We cannot rule out any possibility.''
   Some Wall Street analysts said a round of layoffs could be
announced soon, and more than 1,000 jobs might be eliminated.
   ``There have been signals in the air that something major was
coming,'' said Marc Schulman, an analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. He
defined a major cut as at least 1,000 jobs.
   ``Most companies don't like to cut more than they have to,''
said P. Martin Ressinger, an analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps. ``I think
Data General might cut more than they have to in order to get the
profits, and not just break even.''
   Analysts say Data General has introduced potentially strong
products, particularly with its workstations, but the company faces
a tough task in carving out more of the market.
   The company should concentrate first on becoming profitable, and
then turn its attention to attracting customers, Schulman said.
   ``First they become profitable, then people will start to
evaluate their products,'' he said.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were weak
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, with wheat losing more than
3 cents a bushel.
   ``We'll need an influx of bullish news just to keep this market
steady,'' said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department
Inc. in Chicago.
   The agricultural commodities withstood the buffeting of news
from the Middle East, which sharply affected gold and oil prices.
   However, Karlin said, the sharp drop in stock prices at the
market's opening was interpreted by grain traders as continuing
evidence that a recession may be in the offing, a negative
influence on farm futures.
   Commodities also were under some pressure from a weekly
government report issued late Monday indicating the corn and
soybean crops continue to be growing well in the Midwest.
   There was no help for prices on the demand side, either, said
Karlin.
   ``There's no export demand for wheat and the situation may be
the same for corn and soybeans in a few months,'' he said.
   At the close, wheat futures prices were { cent higher to 3{
cents lower with the contract for delivery in September at $2.77} a
bushel; corn was \ cent higher to 1{ cents lower with September at
$2.51 a bushel; oats were \ cent to { cent lower with September at

   National Semiconductor on Tuesday
announced restructuring that will close facilities in Washington
and Arizona and reduce its worldwide work force by about 2,000.
   The electronics company also said it expects to incur a one-time
charge of about $140 million in its first fiscal quarter ending
Aug. 26, and said its operating results for the quarter will be
below expectations.
   ``We are taking these actions both to refocus our strategic
investments on high-growth, high-potential businesses and to reduce
our costs in line with current revenue projections,'' said Charles
E. Sporck, president and chief executive officer.
   National Semiconductor designs, manufacturers and markets
advanced semiconductor products.
   The company said it will close the fabrication line in its plant
in Puyallup, Wash., idling 300 people. It also plans to close its
Tucson, Ariz., military-product assembly and testing facility,
which will affect 450 workers.
   ``We haven't determined yet where the other layoffs will take
place,'' said company spokeswoman Mary Coady.
   Sporck cited several factors for the decisions, including
``reduced levels of military demand and severe pricing pressure in
certain market sectors.''
   In January of last year the company also announced a
restructuring that included about 2nd staff briefing Tuesday and
more suits are expected to arrive on transport pl so, the enlisted

   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has forced
Saudi Arabia to make a fundamental and perhaps permanent change in
its public approach to the outside world.
   The invasion forced Saudi Arabia, long equivocal about its links
with the West, to publicly ally itself with the United States,
despised by many Arabs for its support of Israel. The United Arab
Emirates and otherarate statements, warned that the United States
would be defeated and ``humiliated'' if it went to war against Iraq.
   Fitzwater said Iraqi officials have refused to give a U.S.
diplomat in Baghdad access to Americans, and he added, ``At this
point we see very little to talk about when all we get are negative
responses.''
   The White House also announced that Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney, returning from a trip through the tense Middle East, and
Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will
fly to Maine Wednesday to confer with Bush at his oceanfront
vacation home. Among the mattersFitzwater said Bush will not sign
before Wednesday the order calling up reserves to fill in the ranks
of doctors, cargo handlers and other specialists depleted by the
massive deployment of U.S. troops to defend Saudi Arabia.
   The number of reservists to be called was still unspecified. One
administration official said privately the order may be open-ended.
   Chief of Staff John Sununu said it will be a ``very surgical,
specialized call-up.''
   Fitzwater said 18 Americans got out of Kuwait Tuesday but
``there are still 54 Americans missing'' _ 13 in Kuwait and 41 in
Iraq.
   ``It does appear that citizens of all nations are being moved
about in Iraq to unknown destinations,'' he said.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
there were ``credible reports'' that Iraq had forced some
Westerners to industrial installations and said an American in
Kuwait was seized in his home and interned in a hotel.
   Boucher said the reports had not been confirmed, nor was it
known whether Americans were among those taken to plants.
   Saddam has threatened to use Westerners as a human shield to
dissuade the United States from attack. More than 3,000 Americans
are among more than 10,000 foreigners trapped in Iraq and Kuwait.
   The buildup of U.S. forces continued in Saudi Arabia.
   At the Pentagon, Gen. Hansford T. Johnson, the top official
responsible for getting troops and supplies to Saudi Arabia, said
security rules prevented him from disclosing the exact number of
ground troops there or on the way but that ``we've moved in
essence'' the equivalent of a town the size of Jefferson City, Mo.
   Preliminary 1990 census figures put Jefferson City's population
at 35,408.
   An additional 20,000 or so sailors are deployed on warships in
the area.
   Fitzwater spoke with reporters at the Woodlands Country Club in
Falmouth, Maine, while Bush was out golfing at a tournament raising
$200,000 for Maine Gov. John McKernan's re-election drive.
   Fitzwater stressed that it was not the United States alone but
``all nations'' that were demanding Iraq to end its occupation of
Kuwait.
   ``We demand complete and unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait.
That is the position of the United Nations and that's the position
of all nations,'' the spokesman said.
   ``I'm sure all nations are interested in the welfare of their
citizens, interested in talking to Iraq at any point. That's not
the same as negotiations over a U.N. demand to get out,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said Joseph Wilson, the U.S. charge d'affaires in
Baghdad, met with Iraqi officials Monday demanding access to
Americans. His plea was spurned.
   Asked if there could be no talks with Iraq until its tanks are
out of Kuwait, Fitzwater replied, ``The important point here is
that the world is united in demanding that Iraq withdraw from
Kuwait. That has not changed one iota by these comments this
morning.''
   Bush, back from a day of speeches in which he termed the
foreigners in Iraq and Kuwait hostages and attacked Saddam as ``a
man of evil standing against human life itself,'' ignored reporters
Tuesday, saying nothing to them during on an early morning jog and
on the golf course.
   Bush spoke by telephone Tuesday to Thomas Pickering, the U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, and to National Security Adviser
Brent Scowcroft who was back at the White House.
   Fitzwater said U.S. warships were still shadowing several ships
in the Persian Gulf region to make sure none violated the trade
embargo with Iraq. However, he said, one Iraqi tanker was being
allowed to dock in a Yemen port based on assurances from the Yemeni
government that that country would not unload or use Iraqi oil.
   Sununu, also out golfing in McKernan's tournament, defended
Bush's decision to stay in Maine in spite of the crisis.
   ``Everybody knows he keeps in touch with what's happening,''
said Sununu. ``I'd rather have a president who kept the whole thing
in perspective than one who locked himself behind closed doors and
brooded about the problem.''
   The president later was attending the funeral of his uncle, Dr.
John Walker, 81, a retired surgeon and investment banker from
Easton, Maine, who died Thursday.

<TEXT>
   A leading official of the European
Community on Tuesday urged finance officials of the United States
and other key industrialized nations to meet soon to discuss the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, said the
officials should meet ``to give positive signs'' to the jittery
financial markets.
   There have been increasing fears that skyrocketing oil prices,
caused by the international embargo against Iraqi and Kuwaiti
crude, will tip the United States and maybe other Western nations
into a recession.
   Delors, a former French finance chief, said the Mideast crisis
required more coordination of the economic policies of the Group of
Seven countries _ the United States, Britain, France, Canada,
Japan, Italy and West Germany.
   Those nations' top finance officials meet periodically to assess
the world economic outlook and monitor their own economic and
monetary performance.
   Delors acknowledged he had no say in scheduling the high-level
talks, comparing his suggestion to ``a bottle sent out to sea.''

<TEXT>
   The European Community's executive body
on Tuesday endorsed a blueprint for forming tighter economic and
monetary links that would include a U.S.-style central bank in 1993.
   It also would lead to creation of a single currency to be used
throughout the dozen nations of the trading bloc.
   The plan was offered to guide the nations at a special
conference opening in December to make any needed changes in their
founding Treaty of Rome to forge an economic and monetary union.
   Henning Christophersen, the community's top economics official,
told a news conference that there should be a short period of time
between establishing the European-wide system of central banks,
dubbed EuroFed, and moving to a single currency.
   The commission's blueprint will be discussed by economics and
finance ministers of the dozen nations at a meeting in early
September in Rome.
   The first stage of a three-part plan to put an economic and
monetary union in place began on July 1, with greater coordination
of policies among the community governments.
   Under the proposed blueprint, the second stage would open on
Jan. 1, 1993, when work would get under way on the independent
central banking system.
   No date has been proposed for the final stage and introduction
of the single currency.

<TEXT>
   Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. on Tuesday repurchased 2.36
million shares of its own stock when the share price of the Wall
Street firm hit a 52-week low.
   The buyback, part of a program dating to November 1987, amounted
to about 2.4 percent of the firm's common shares outstanding. The
stock was bought from a single, unidentified institutional
investor, a spokesman said.
   The purchase was made early in the trading day, when Bear
Stearns' shares fell to $10, setting a new 52-week low. The stock
has traded as high as $15.25 in the last year.
   ``The stock was for sale. We've been buying stock on an ongoing
basis,'' company spokesman Jonathan Barnett said.
   Like many Wall Street firms, Bear Stearns shares have been hurt
by a recession in the securities industry. The stock closed Tuesday
at $10.50 a share in New York Stock Exchange trading, down 25 cents
from Monday.
   ``Their stock price is down. They've got excess capital,'' said
Lawrence Eckenfelder, an industry analyst with Prudential
Bache-Securities Inc. in San Francisco.
   The purchase was made under a company program that allows it to
use profits from November 1987 on to repurchase stock. Bear
Stearns' board in July 1988 expanded the program to include
purchases in privately negotiated transactions.

<HEAD>Dollar, Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished mixed after falling overseas
Tuesday in a volatile session that saw the currency buffeted by
conflicting reports about the prospects for stability in the Middle
East.
   Gold prices slipped after rising sharply in Europe. On the New
York Commodity Exchange, one troy ounce of gold closed at $407.40,
off $2.70 an ounce from Monday. Later, Republic National Bank
quoted an after-hours bid of $406.90, down $2.35 as of 4 p.m. EDT.
   Traders sold the dollar following a report that Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein was willing to negotiate a peace settlement. But
later reports that the Iraqis were mining Kuwaiti ports and
refineries pushed the dollar higher.
   ``The dollar and gold got whipsawed by these conflicting
reports,'' said Marc Chandler, an analyst with MMS International in
Chicago. ``The dollar put in its lows on the idea that there would
be peace, then when that seemed to fade,'' it was pushed back up.
   In times of international turmoil, the dollar is in demand
because it is perceived as a ``safe-haven'' currency.
   But another round of bearish economic data further pressured an
already weak U.S. currency. The government reported that the
federal budget deficit jumped $25.9 billion in July, pushing the
fiscal year's imbalance so far to $189.1 billion, compared with
$123.7 billion at the end of July 1989.
   The report induced traders to sell dollars because it appears
the U.S. economy may be headed into a recession. Lower interest
rates, which typically follow in an economic slowdown, would make
dollar-denominated securities less appealing to foreign investors.
   Still, investors are ``a little afraid to get a little too short
of dollars,'' said Gilbert Cisneros, a trader at the Bank of
Boston's New York office. ``If something does spark (in the Middle
East), it's expensive to get the dollars back.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 146.55 Japanese yen from
147.47 yen late Monday. Later in London, the dollar fell to 146.35
yen. In New York the dollar closed at 146.80 yen, up from 146.51
yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.9215 from $1.9185 late
Monday. In New York, it cost $1.9113 to buy one pound, less
expensive than Monday's $1.9135.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday
included: 1.5645 German marks, up from 1.5642; 1.2900 Swiss francs,
down from 1.2955; 5.2635 French francs, up from 5.2565; 1,161.75
Italian lire, up from 1,157.25, and 1.1399 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1427.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Monday included: 1.5545 German marks, down from 1.5625; 1.2855
Swiss francs, down from 1.2940; 5.2325 French francs, down from
5.2375; 1.7530 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7585; 1,155.75 Italian
lire, down from 1,156.50; and 1.1437 Canadian dollars, unchanged.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $413.25 a troy ounce from
$409.75 late Monday. In Zurich, gold rose to $414.75 an ounce from
$409.75 late Monday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.32 an ounce
to $407.45.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
fetched $5.091 a troy ounce, down from $5.129 on Monday. But in
London, silver rose to a late bid of $5.20 an ounce from $5.14.

<HEAD>IBM Announces New Mid-Range Computers, Enhancements</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   IBM on Tuesday announced two new lower-priced
models of its popular midrange Application System-400 computer
line, as well as software enhancements designed to improve the
computers' performance.
   The cheapest of the new models is priced at $18,250, 27 percent
below the previous lowest-cost AS-400, International Business
Machines Corp. said.
   IBM says this means small companies, or departments of large
corporations, can now afford an AS-400 computer.
   IBM also announced a new model of its Application System-Entry
line, a lower-priced computer line. This new model, which will be
priced at $11,000, could later be upgraded to an AS-400 machine,
IBM said.
   In addition, IBM announced more than 200 hardware and software
enhancements for the entire AS-400 line. They include a new version
of the AS-400's operating system, the base layer of software that
controls internal computer functions, as well as new data storage
devices.
   IBM said it intends to announce new high-end extensions of the
2-year-old AS-400 line by mid-1991 that will increase performance
and capacity.
   Bob Djurdjevic, an industry analyst and president of Annex
Research in Phoenix, said the new low-end AS-400 models should help
increase the market share for the line.
   But he said more significant news was buried in IBM's
announcement, the fact that it will license independent software
houses to use the internal code of the operating system of the
AS-400 computers to develop new applications programs. Previously,
IBM regarded this operating system code as proprietary, Djurdjevic
said.
   He said the move shows IBM is responding to the move by the
computer industry toward ``open,'' or non-proprietary, operating
systems.
   ``The fact that the AS-400 is now becoming a more open system
will undoubtedly aid it in its competition for software developers'
hearts and minds,'' he said in a report on IBM's announcement.
   There already are about 8,000 applications programs for the
AS-400 line, he said.

   A California businessman settled a civil
complaint with federal securities regulators Tuesday, the same day
they accused him of failing to disclose the size of his stake in a
company over a three-year period.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission said it had accepted Joel
M. Barry's settlement of charges that he failed to report on time,
among other things, transactions totaling $3.3 million. Barry
neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing.
   In an unrelated case, the SEC's regional office in Fort Worth,
Texas, said a San Antonio, Texas, man accused of helping loot a
mutual fund, the Prospector Fund, of millions of dollars, has
settled civil charges.
   In the case against Barry, 40, of Thousand Oaks, Calif., the SEC
charged that he violated securities laws by failing to file reports
in a timely manner over three years concerning transactions
involving Electronic Clearing House Inc., Agoura hills, Calif., of
which he was chairman, and Basics Financial Planning and
Investments Inc., an Anaheim real estate concern of which he was
president.
   Basics also was accused of failing to disclose in a timely
fashion $2.4 million in transactions between June 1987 through June
1990.
   Federal securities laws require stockholders holding 5 percent
or more of a publicly traded company to report when it acquires the
5 percent, as well as any significant developments. The disclosure
requirement is aimed at giving the public adequate information to
make investing decisions.
   The SEC charged that Barry and Basics did not file for more than
three years the required disclosure documents, when they held
between 16 and 42 percent of ECHI's common stock.
   In the Texas case, Carl L. Lazzell of San Antonio settled civil
charges without admitting or denying wrongdoing and agreed to pay
restitution in an amount to be determined by a federal judge.
   According to the SEC, Lazzell, who was Prospector's former
portfolio manager, caused the gold stocks' mutual fund to buy about
$20 million in over-valued securities and allededly took $1 million
in kickbacks from two Canadians, David H. Ward of Vancouver and
Edward Carter of Toronto, who controlled the securities.
   James Sims, an SEC attorney in Texas, said Prospector suffered
$15 million in trading losses but has recovered much of it through
separate civil lawsuits.

<TEXT>
   Unleaded gasoline prices soared to a fifth
straight record high on Tuesday, but the price of crude oil fell as
traders reacted to what appeared to be more conciliatory rhetoric
from Iraq.
   ``It calmed the market,'' said William Byers, an oil analyst
with Bear Stearns &amp; Co. ``It calmed traders, because it indicated
there was another possible solution to the situation, other than
military.''
   Crude prices slipped as Iraqi officials were quoted as saying
they were willing to negotiate a solution to the Middle East
crisis. But prices inched back up after the White House said it had
no plans to seek a deal while Iraqi forces remained in Kuwait.
   The September contract for light sweet crude oil closed at
$28.41 per barrel, 15 cents lower than Monday, but other futures
prices for months going through June 1991 were all higher on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. Later months were lower.
   ``Everybody's trading on headlines,'' Byers said.
   Oil markets have been chaotic since Iraq invaded its neighbor on
Aug. 2, pushing up prices of crude oil and gasoline over fear of
supply disruptions.
   The rise has been particularly dramatic in the wholesale price
of unleaded gasoline, which closed at a record high Tuesday for the
fifth-straight day to $1.013, up 1.01 cents from Monday.
   Concerns about shortages have some consumers keeping their tanks
full and some service stations keeping their supplies at higher
levels, said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc.
   ``They're anticipating shortages down the line,'' Hittle said.
Traders have been concerned of a lack of refinery capacity, with
U.S. plants running at nearly full capacity and three modern
Kuwaiti refineries taken out of the world market by the
international boycott of oil from Iraq and Kuwait.
   Other petroleum futures were up Tuesday, as natural gas moved
from $1.417 to $1.420 per 1,000 cubic feet on September contracts
and wholesale home heating oil rose .75 cent to 83.71 cents per
gallon. Tuesday was the last trading day for September petroleum
contracts on the Merc.
   After the markets closed, the American Petroleum Institute
reported that crude oil and gasoline imports were up last week.
Gasoline stocks were also higher, although crude stocks were
slightly down.
   The API's weekly report said crude imports rose to 6.5 million
barrels per day for the week ending Aug. 10, up from 6.2 million
barrels per day a week earlier but down from 6.9 million barrels
per day a year earlier. The nation's stockpile of crude oil dipped
from 375.9 million barrels to 375.7 million barrels, although it
was well above the 335.2 million barrels reported a year earlier.
   Gasoline stockpiles rose to 214 million barrels, up from 212.4
million barrels a week earlier but down from 223.9 million barrels
a year earlier. Gasoline imports rose to 545,000 barrels per day,
up from 376,000 barrels a day a week earlier and 280,000 barrels a
day a year earlier.
   U.S. refineries were running at 92.3 percent of capacity, down
from 94.3 percent a week earlier but up from 90 percent a year
earlier.

<HEAD>Gold Prices Bounce on Reports from Middle East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   War-wary traders sent gold futures prices into a strong rally
then a sharp reversal as Middle East developments sent conflicting
signals Tuesday to the trading pits at the Commodity Exchange in
New York.
   Prices were up more than $6 an ounce early, then turned around
and sunk nearly $9 below Monday's close before trimming the losses.
   On other markets, petroleum futures were mostly higher; orange
juice was sharply lower; grain and soybeans were mostly lower; and
cattle was mostly higher while pork declined.
   ``The gold market was a pretty volatile session,'' said Craig
Sloane, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New
York. ``Traders are nervous. If you happen to be long in gold
you've got a lot to lose if things calm down in the Middle East.''
   Even before trading began for the day, the market was looking
for higher prices on a rumor that a U.S. plane had been shot down
in the Mideast. The prices held firm even after the rumor was
denied.
   But when Saddam Husseim made an address to President Bush and
Iraq's defense minister, Tariq Aziz, called for a negotiated
settlement, the gains in gold futures gave way, dropping $15 below
the day's high.
   ``Perhaps the market was expecting or fearing a declaration of
war or whatever,'' Sloane said.
   The losses were trimmed before the close as the market came to
realize that Iraq's statements broke no new ground.
   ``It doesn't take much to get the market moving in any
direction,'' said Sloane.
   Gold futures settled $2.70 to $2.90 lower with the August
contract at $407.40 a troy ounce; silver was 3.4 cents to 4.1 cents
lower with September at $5.105 a troy ounce.
   Petroleum futures had a wild day at the New York Mercantile
Exchange, opening sharply higher, then plunging on news of Iraq's
willingness to negotiate a Middle East settlement, then rallying to
close mostly higher.
   West Texas intermediate crude oil settled 15 cents lower to 18
cents higher with the September contract at $28.41 a barrel;
heating oil was .75 cent to 1.78 cents higher with September at
83.71 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .25 cent to 5.55
cents higher with September at $1.0126 a gallon.
   Orange juice futures dropped sharply on fears that Brazil, which
cut prices last Friday, might bring them even lower.
   Futures lost 14.5 cents a pound since Friday's announcement.
   ``They fear getting into a price-cut cycle,'' said Sandra Kaul,
an analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   On the New York Cotton Exchange, orange juice futures retreated
1.95 cents to 4.15 cents with September settling at $1.6675 a pound.
   Cattle futures were mostly higher while the pork complex
declined on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle regained losses suffered Monday when many traders
interpreted a USDA cattle-on-feed report as bearish, said Tom
Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp. of Arlington Heights,
Ill.
   That interpretation was shown to be mistaken, he said, when
Tuesday's cash markets were strong.
   ``In pork, there's an overall bearish situation,'' he said.
``We're going to see the slaughter increase more than seasonally as
we move into the late summer and fall.''
   Live cattle settled .30 cent lower to .53 cent higher with the
October contract at 77.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle .15 cent
lower to .55 cent higher with August at 89.87 cents a pound; live
hogs were .12 cent to .77 cent lower with October at 49.30 cents a
pound; and frozen pork bellies were .70 cent to the limit 2 cents
lower with August at 47.72 cents a pound.
   Wheat futures lost more than 3 cents a bushel in weak grain and
soybean trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   ``We'll need an influx of bullish news just to keep this market
steady,'' said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department
Inc. in Chicago.
   He said the market was weakened by the sharp drop in stock
prices, suggesting to grain traders that a recession isn't far off.
   Wheat settled { cent to 2{ cents lower with the September
contract at $2.80\ a bushel; corn was } cent lower to 1 cent higher
with September at $2.51} a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1\ cents
higher with September at $1.17{ a bushel; and soybeans were 2 cents
lower to 3 cents higher with August at $6.11 a bushel.

   Stock prices fell sharply in heavy trading
Tuesday as investors continued to worry about the prospect of war
in the Mideast.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 52.48 to
close at 2,603.96. Earlier, the Dow was down by as much as 77
points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by nearly 6 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
243 up, 1,441 down and 340 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 194.63 million
shares, up from 129.63 million Monday.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 236.78 million shares.
   With little economic news, investors fretted over the Iraqi
situation, traders said.
   ``Everyone's just very, very nervous here,'' said Tony Woodruff,
a managing director at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   The market received little reassurance from a speech by Iraq's
president, Saddam Hussein, aimed at President Bush.
   Saddam said his nation's detention of foreigners was justified
given the aggressive response by foreign nations to Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait. He added that if the United States continues its
aggression, ``a disaster will take place concerning the whole
world.''
   Woodruff said the rise in oil prices due to the Mideast tension
is of particular concern to the stock market. Though crude prices
were mixed Tuesday, prices of gasoline and other refined products
jumped.
   Analysts said the market also was hurt by losses on overseas
stock exchanges.
   Stock prices fell sharply in Frankfurt, primarily due to a rumor
_ later dismissed _ that a U.S. plane was shot down over Iraq.
Share prices also closed sharply lower in London trading. Earlier,
prices slipped for the fourth consecutive session in Tokyo.
   Several times the Dow fell more than 50 points, each time
triggering one of the NYSE's ``circuit breakers'' designed to
prevent a price freefall. The mechanism bars stock sales connected
to index-futures arbitrage until the prices of the stocks involved
rise.
   Philip Morris was the most-active NYSE stock, falling 1 to 43~
as 3.66 million shares changed hands. Stocks of consumer-oriented
companies have been particularly hard-hit in recent days.
   Among other most-active blue-chip stocks, General Electric fell
1~ to 61~, Boeing slipped 2&rsqb; to 46&lsqb;, IBM dropped 1} to 100{ and
AT&amp;T fell ~ to 32~.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $62.601 billion, or 2.01
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
3.48 to 176.94.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 7.92 to 379.81, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index dropped 6.65 to 321.86.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
8.91 to 379.68. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index dropped 3.95 to 327.34.

<TEXT>
   British Aerospace PLC said Tuesday it had firm
orders for 25 of its BAe 146 aircraft, with options for eight more,
in a deal worth about $900 million for the British company.
   British Aerospace has now sold 293 of the four-engine airliner
that entered service in 1983 and is known as the quiet jet. It can
seat between 70 and 120 passengers.
   The total value of the latest package of orders, including
options on the additional eight aircraft and spares, approaches 500
million pounds, or $900 million, making it the largest single
package of orders announced for the aircraft, the company said.
   The 25 firm orders are from nine airlines in seven countries.
   The company said airlines involved in the new orders included
Belgium's Sabena, Indonesia's PT National Air Carrier, Air Botswana
and Dan Air of Britain, which was the first airline to introduce
the BAe 146 into service in 1983.

<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six of the 13 members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet next week
to discuss oil supplies in the midst of the Middle East crisis,
petroleum industry sources said.
   Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela
will participate, the sources said. It was not immediately clear
where the meeting would be held.
   Saudi Arabia and Venezuela had failed Monday to convince a
majority of OPEC members to agree to a conference on the Gulf
crisis.
   The two countries want OPEC to allow members to raise production
to make up for 4 million barrels of crude kept off the market each
day because of the international boycott of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil.
World crude prices have risen significantly since Iraq invaded its
neighbor on Aug. 2.
   Saudi Arabia plans no unilateral oil production increase to make
up the fall in global supply, according to the Saudi ambassador to
Algeria.
   But Saudi Arabia continues to consult with other OPEC members
about raising oil production, Mohamed Hassan Faki told reporters
Monday evening.
   An ``eventual'' increase in oil prices would have a ``disastrous
effect on the world economy,'' Faki said. Saudi Arabia had
indicated over the weekend it would increase production by up to 2
million barrels of oil per day, even without approval from OPEC.

<HEAD>Reports 16 Percent Profit Rise in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOLINE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deere &amp; Co. said Tuesday its third-quarter
earnings rose 16 percent from a year ago as its sales rose 6
percent.
   Deere said it earned $114.1 million, or $1.50 per share, in the
three months ended July 31 compared with $98.2 million, or $1.30
per share, during the same period a year earlier. The company's
fiscal year ends Oct. 31.
   Quarterly revenue rose to $2.05 billion from $1.9 billion a year
ago.
   Deere Chairman Hans W. Becherer credited strong retail sales of
tractors and farm machinery in North America for the increased
earnings.
   ``However, declining consumer spending for durable goods is
resulting in lower retail sales of our lawn and grounds care
products, which were below last year's levels during the quarter
and are now down slightly for the first nine months of 1990,''
Becherer said in a statement.
   Deere on Tuesday announced the layoff of 160 workers at its
Horicon, Wis., plant, which employs about 1,000. A sharp decline in
sales of lawn tractors and grounds-care equipment was blamed for
the indefinite layoffs, which take effect next week.
   Deere experienced strong gains in the performance of its
financial subsidiaries for the quarter. The units are involved in
credit, insurance and health-care operations.
   For the first nine months of the 1990 fiscal year, Deere
earnings are $336.6 million, or $4.44 per share, up 22 percent from
$277 million, or $3.68 per share, in the first nine months a year
earlier.
   Revenue rose 11 percent to $5.82 billion from $5.22 billion a
year earlier.
   ``It's obvious to us the recovery of the farm economy is very
much on target,'' Deere spokesman Robert Combs said. ``Some experts
say farmers are seeing record increases in income and that's good
news for equipment makers. The most important single factor to us
is the agricultural economy.''

   U.S. financial markets took a roller-coaster ride Tuesday as
traders reacted fitfully to sometimes belligerent, sometimes
conciliatory talk from Iraq.
   The stock market ended the day sharply lower, oil prices fell,
bonds were nearly unchanged and gold prices slipped _ but the
markets were characterized by wild ups and downs throughout the day.
   ``Comments on the Middle East are just whacking the market this
way and that,'' said Robert Brusca, chief economist with Nikko
Securities International Inc.
   Financial markets focused on televised statements from Iraq by
the nation's defense minister and its president, Saddam Hussein,
who again escalated the level of rhetoric in the Persian Gulf
standoff.
   The market was heartened when Iraqi defense minister Tariq Aziz
said in Jordan the country was willing to negotiate a settlement to
the crisis, but he did not offer to withdraw Iraqi troops from
Kuwait and restore the monarchy.
   Hussein later offered more harsh words for President Bush and
the United States, predicting a ``major catastrophe'' if
hostilities break out and ``a bloody conflict'' that America will
lose. Iraq also was reported to be mining Kuwaiti ports and
refineries.
   The war words rattled Wall Street, which has taken a beating
because of concerns over the U.S. economy's poor performance in
recent months. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 52.48 to close
at 2,603.96. Earlier, the Dow average was down by as much as 77
points.
   Crude oil prices slipped after Aziz's settlement comment but
inched back up when the White House said it had no plans to strike
a deal while Iraqi forces continued to occupy neighboring Kuwait.
The price closed witha 15-cent loss on the New York Mercantile
Exchange at $28.41 a barrel.
   ``When Hussein comes out and says let's talk, people take some
profits and stay on the sidelines and say let's see what he wants
to talk about,'' said Jack O'Dea, manager of international energy
futures for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Among refined petroleum products, unleaded gasoline closed at a
record high for the fifth straight day at $1.013 per gallon, up
1.01 cents. Natural gas rose .03 cent to $1.420 per 1,000 cubic
feet and home heating oil rose .75 cent to 83.71 cents per gallon.
   The dollar finished mixed against foreign currencies in a
volatile session, also buffeted by the conflicting comments from
Iraq. Gold prices slipped after rising sharply in Europe. Gold
prices closed at $407.40, off $2.70 an ounce from Monday.
   After falling sharply amid fears of oil-backed inflation, bond
price gained ground to close nearly unchanged. The Treasury's key
30-year bond fell 63 cents per $1,000 face amount after losing more
than $5 in morning trading before rebounding sharply.
   Yields on the long bond cracked 9 percent during the day, before
falling back later.
   ``With all the different comments, you just don't really know
what the heck to do,'' Brusca said. ``The markets seemed willing to
seize upon a seed of good news.''
   Overseas, financial markets were battered by an unconfirmed
report later denied by the State Department that a U.S. plane was
shot down over Iraq. The Frankfurt stock market tumbled 5 percent,
while prices closed sharply lower in London and Tokyo.

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. has renamed its ARCAD
Inc. subsidiary, created as a 50-50 joint venture with the French
automaker Renault, as JJ International Automotive Corp., the U.S.
company said Tuesday.
   The new name reflects the ``JJ'' codename of a small
sport-utility vehicle the company wants to make and market. There
have been rumors that Chrysler may decide to build the vehicle by
itself or may be looking for a partner to replace Renault.
   In June, Chrysler said it terminated its $500 million agreement
with Renault because it was no longer economically attractive.
Chrysler bought Renault's stake in ARCAD for an undisclosed sum.
   When the joint venture ended, the U.S. automaker said it would
continue development on the small sport-utility vehicle.
   There has been speculation that Chrysler will build the JJ at
its Toledo, Ohio, Jeep plant as a kit with major assemblies, such
as body panels, interiors and powertrains, being made by suppliers.
That would cut Chrysler's investment in the vehicle.
   The JJ will be designed to compete with the Daihatsu Rocky,
Suzuki Sidekick and Geo Tracker.

<HEAD>Stardent Strengthens Relationship with Company, Ousts Two
Directors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stardent Computer Inc. shareholders voted
Tuesday to strengthen the company's relationship with Kubota
Computer of Japan and oust two board members who sued the Japanese
firm.
   The removal of Allen Michels and Matthew Sanders III from the
Stardent board of directors followed their dismissal last month as
co-chairmen of the company, which makes graphics computers.
   Stardent was formed last year through the merger of Stellar
Computer Inc., based in Newton, and Ardent Computer Corp. of
Sunnyvale, Calif.
   Prior to the merger, Kubota owned 44 percent of Ardent, and now
owns 22 percent of the combined companies.
   But in July, Michels and Sanders, who were the founders of
Ardent, filed a lawsuit claiming that Kubota forced the merger in
order to weaken Ardent and eventually gain its technology.
   After the suit was filed, the Stardent board of directors
removed Michels and Sanders as co-chairmen. On Tuesday,
shareholders voted to remove the two men from the board entirely.
   The company said the action was taken because Sanders and
Michels were no longer officers or employees of the company.
   Roxanne Frisiello, a Stardent spokeswoman, insisted that the
removal of the two men as co-chairmen had nothing to do with the
lawsuit. Instead, it was due to ``differences in management style''
and the relocation of Sunnyvale offices to Newton, which eliminated
the need for their positions.
   Under terms of the agreements approved by stockholders, Kubota
will invest up to $60 million in Stardent over the next 12 months,
raising Kubota's total stake in the company to 28 percent.
   In return, Stardent has granted certain technology and
distribution rights and licenses to a Kubota subsidiary in San
Jose, Calif.
   Kubota abstained from the voting, Frisiello said.

<HEAD>Say Board of Trade Probing Possible Attempt to Corner Soybean Oil
Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board of Trade said Tuesday it is
keeping an eye on soybean oil futures purchases amid reports that a
unit of grain-processing giant Archer Daniels Midland is trying to
corner the market.
   Market cornering is considered an unfair trading practice in
which one company controls so much of a commodity it can wield an
enormous influence over the price to the disadvantage of other
traders.
   The actions by the Chicago Board of Trade, one of the world's
leading commodities exchanges, involves ADM Investor Services, an
arm of ADM. The action comes about a year after the exchange issued
an emergency order to break up a similar suspected attempt by an
Italian firm.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency
that regulates the futures industry, also said it was monitoring
the market closely.
   At ADM headquarters in Decatur, Ill., aides said the firm had no
comment.
   ADM is believed to hold more than half of all contracts for July
and August delivery of soybean oil, the Wall Street Journal
reported Tuesday.
   Board of Trade spokesman Michael Oakes said ``a considerable
amount of bean oil has been purchased by ADM.''
   ``I'm sure it's being handled by our business conduct committee,
that they are looking into it,'' Oakes said.
   ``Until it reaches a point where we feel it's a threat, we just
watch and monitor,'' he said.
   The board of trade determined there was a similar threat in July
1989, when it appeared that Ferruzzi SPA, one of the world's
largest soybean processors, was trying to corner the soybean market.
   Ferruzzi had acquired large positions in the soybean market and
owned more than four-fifths of all soybeans available for immediate
delivery, exchange officials and regulators concluded.
   To keep Ferruzzi from gaining control over soybean prices, the
CFTC ordered the firm to reduce its holdings by 20 million bushels.
The Board of Trade then issued an emergency order requiring the
liquidation of large positions in its July soybean contract.
   That touched off wild swings in bean prices and prompted sharp
criticism by farm groups and traders who saw the value of their
futures holdings plummet.

<HEAD>State Board To Review Cough-Medicine Abuse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BLOOD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state panel this month will consider
restricting over-the-counter sales of Robitussin-DM and other cough
remedies because they apparently have found a niche among teen-age
drug abusers, officials said Tuesday.
   In one case last winter, police in the Pennsylvania community of
Waynesboro discovered dozens of discarded cough medicine bottles at
a park frequented by teens. An officer in the town of Williamsport
said a local boy reportedly suffered kidney problems because of his
long-term abuse of cough syrups.
   ``The fact is they are using the substance to get high,'' said
Gerald Keenan, a physician's assistant in Waynesboro who has
identified cases involving cough medicine abuse.
   ``We could not believe at the time we saw this that the level of
intoxication ... was caused by cough syrup. We thought it was
caused by alcohol or something else,'' he said.
   A group of pharmacists from south-central Pennsylvania has asked
the state Department of Health to pull Robitussin and other cough
medicines containing dextromethorphan from store shelves, placing
it under the control of pharmacists.
   If the request is approved, medicines containing
dextromethorphan, the most effective cough treatment on the market,
could be purchased only by people 18 and older. Consumers would
have to sign a form to buy the products, and would be permitted to
purchase only 4 ounces within 72 hours.
   ``The department needs to address it in some manner,'' said Jack
Ogun, administrative secretary of the state Drug, Device and
Cosmetic Board.
   The change ``would take it off display, which would be the
biggest crunch as far as sales,'' Ogun said.
   Dextromethorphan, the active ingredient in about 75 cough
medicines including Robitussin and Vicks 44, first came on the
market as a prescription medicine in the mid-1950s. It was approved
for over-the-counter sales in 1976.
   Officials said the drug is safe and effective when taken as
prescribed, but it can produce effects ranging from lightheadedness
to hallucinations when ingested in large doses. Ogun said someone
who drinks large amounts runs a risk of convulsions, a allergic
reaction or a slowdown in bodily functions. He was unaware of any
fatalities from abuse.
   There is no comprehensive information on the extent of abuses,
but Ogun said he was aware of at least 50 cases statewide.
   ``We're concerned with it here locally because it's not illegal
to buy it, possess it or drink it,'' said Waynesboro Police Chief
Glenn Phenicie.
   ``It's probably been a problem longer than we realize,'' he
added.
   Pennsylvania is not the first state to confront abuse linked to
Robitussin and other cough preparations. In Utah, a group of
parents led a successful campaign to have Robitussin voluntarily
placed behind pharmacy counters.
   Police said they favored the proposal to limit access to cough
syrups, but the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association, an
industry group, said such a move would create an inconvenience for
legitimate consumers.
   For the industry, there is a lot at stake. According to Kline &amp;
Co., a New Jersey business consulting firm, the 14 leading cough
syrups containing dextromethorphan have a wholesale market of about
$625 million annually nationwide.
   Controlling sales ``would literally remove that convenient
access to that medicine to the vast majority of people who use it
safely and effectively,'' said Vincent Clough, an association
spokesman.
   The industry would not oppose voluntary controls, Clough said.
He added that the association was working with local officials in
Waynesboro and had provided pamphlets for distribution.
   A.H. Robins, which manufacturers Robitussin cough syrups, said
in a statement it was working with the association and other
companies to address the misuse of dextromethorphan.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has formed a task force
that is looking into reported abuses of dextromethorphan.
   The state board on drugs, devices and cosmetics plans to hold a
hearing on Aug. 28 on the pharmacists' request. A recommendation
will be forwarded to the state secretary of health, who has the
authority to reclassify drugs.
