   An Ariane rocket carrying two
U.S.-made telecommunications satellites blasted off Friday night
from this remote launching facility.
   The unmanned Ariane 44-L rocket, powered by four strap-on liquid
fuel boosters, roared off its northeast South American launch-pad
on schedule at 7:58 p.m.
   The rocket carried two satellites built by the Hughes Aircraft
Co. of Pasadena, Calif., that were successfully put into
geostationary orbit 23,000 miles over the Galapagos Islands west of
the Ecuadoran coast.
   The countdown briefly stopped to top off the third stage with
extra hydrogen and oxygen fuel to provide the vehicle with added
boost, Ariane officials said.
   The mission is the 39th since the commercial Arianespace program
started a decade ago, and the third since a rocket exploded in
February with two Japanese satellites aboard.
   Weather for the launch was good and did not affect the liftoff
despite the presence of residual winds from Hurricane Lili to the
north.

<HEAD>Defense Calls No Witnesses in MacDonald Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prosecution rested its case Friday
in the bribery and kickback trial of suspended Navajo Chairman
Peter MacDonald and his son, and defense attorneys said they would
call no witnesses.
   Closing arguments and jury instructions were scheduled for
Monday.
   Defense attorneys Val Jolley for MacDonald and Steven Boos for
Peter ``Rocky'' MacDonald Jr. made their surprise announcements
without elaborating. Jolley had said previously he planned to call
up to 15 witnesses.
   ``Their case is in a shambles. We don't have anything we have to
defend,'' Jolley said Friday. ``The only time you have to present a
defense is when a case is proven beyond a reasonable doubt.''
   If convicted in tribal District Court on all 42 counts of
bribery, conspiracy and ethics violations, MacDonald could be
jailed for up to 23 years and barred from serving in tribal office
for four years.
   When asked whether he was afraid to hear the jury's verdict,
MacDonald, a former Marine, said, ``I've faced worse situations
than this. I was in the South Pacific in World War II.''
   The prosecution rested its case after calling 23 witnesses.
   The defense earlier asked Judge Robert Yazzie to dismiss all
charges.
   The judge agreed to dismiss three: an ethics and  conspiracy
charge against MacDonald and an ethics charge against his son. He
ruled there was a lack of evidence of wrongdoing over an alleged
attempt by the defendants to solicit a consultant contract from
Peabody Coal Co. for the younger MacDonald.
   In addition, the prosecution on Friday dropped one bribery count
against MacDonald because a scheduled witness did not appear during
the trial.
   Yazzie ruled that all other counts will be decided by the jury.
   Still pending against MacDonald are 42 counts of bribery,
extortion, conspiracy and ethics violations. His son, an unemployed
lawyer who lives in San Jose, Calif., now faces 23 counts,
including 11 bribery or theft by extortion, 11 of ethics violations
and one of conspiracy.
   MacDonald is accused of accepting bribes and kickbacks from
businesses operating on the Navajo reservation, the nation's
biggest. Jolley has argued that MacDonald made no threats or
promises when he accepted loans and gifts from businessmen.
   MacDonald was placed on administrative leave last year by the
Tribal Council after allegations of corruption surfaced midway
through his fourth, four-year term. He and former Chairman Peterson
Zah are on the Nov. 6 ballot for the newly created post of tribal
president.
   The trial, being heard by a jury panel of six Navajos, one
Pueblo Indian and five non-Indians, began Oct. 1.

<HEAD>White House Pays Price for Imprecision on Tax Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Backpedaling and admitting error, the White
House is struggling to pull itself out of three days of
embarrassing budget confusion spawned by President Bush.
   ``Hindsight's always better,'' presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said Thursday. He said the White House should have moved
quickly to explain Bush's apparent flip-flop on taxes and
contradictory statements by administration officials Tuesday and
Wednesday.
   ``I think we just made a mistake in not doing that, frankly,''
Fitzwater said. ``That's exactly what we should have done.''
   The misstep has cost Bush dearly, prompting headlines of
presidential waffling, zigzagging and retreat. Some Wall Street
analysts blame his apparent indecision, along with higher oil
prices, for the stock market's plunge this week.
   There also has been a political price. Republicans worry that
the appearance of disarray at the White House and by GOP lawmakers
on the budget has given Democrats new ammunition for the November
elections.
   Even the GOP's bedrock opposition to higher taxes is being
called into question.
   ``I'm sick and tired of going home to rural Wisconsin and
protecting a Republican image as the party of the rich,'' said Rep.
Steve Gunderson.
   Rep. Fred Grandy, R-Iowa, said, ``I think we made a mistake,
this party made a mistake, taking ... this blood oath'' against tax
rate increases.
   At a news conference Tuesday, Bush threw the budget negotiations
with Congress into confusion by saying - for the first time in
public - that he would be willing to raise income taxes on the rich
in exchange for a lower tax rate on capital gains, which are
profits on the sales of investments.
   His statement sent shudders through the ranks of Senate
Republicans. They rushed to the White House and told Bush that
Democrats would not drop the capital gains tax rate low enough to
warrant an increase in income tax rates on the wealthy.
   The lawmakers said Bush - in a surprising turnabout - agreed
that he should drop the idea. Fitzwater agreed with what the
lawmakers said.
   By the next day, the White House was in retreat again. Neither
the president nor his spokesman was willing to describe Bush's
position. Fitzwater said Bush had not made any commitment to the
senators. ``Read my hips,'' Bush said, adding to the confusion
during a jogging excursion.
   The White House was hammered with more unflattering headlines.
``Bush Trips, Capital Reels,'' The New York Times said on the front
page Thursday.
   There was even more chaos Thursday when Bush met with senior
congressional Republicans. When the meeting was over, Rep. Bill
Archer, R-Texas, said Bush had unequivocally endorsed the idea of a
modest increase in income tax rates for the rich in exchange for a
sharp cut in capital gains tax rates.
   That was the position Bush had taken on Tuesday - later
disavowed by the White House.
   Already burned, the White House moved quickly to control the
damage. A written statement by Fitzwater said that, yes, Bush did
like the idea of trading an income tax increase for the wealthy for
a capital gains tax cut. Yet, the White House said Congress would
not buy that idea.
   ``I think it's a waste of time because I just don't think it can
get through both houses of Congress,'' Bush said. Thus, the idea
was buried.
   Fitzwater was left with the job of trying to reconcile Bush's
statements with the remarks of Republican members of Congress after
conferences with the president.
   ``One of the phenomenons about group meetings is that people
hear what they want to hear,'' Fitzwater said. But the spokesman
acknowledged that his boss - the president - had been imprecise at
Tuesday's news conference when he linked capital gains with a
higher tax on the rich.
   ``I don't think he meant to say it in a way - in the way it was
interpreted by some of you,'' Fitzwater told reporters.
   For his part, the president said he was unfazed by the flap.
   ``These things come and go,'' he said. ``The best thing - we get
a good deal, if we get a good deal, people forget the name-calling
and they'll forget the little rancor and the tension at the time.''

<HEAD>Polls Show Big Levin Lead, But Schuette Optimistic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF HOLYFIELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Bill Schuette is hammering away
at Sen. Carl Levin as a free-spending liberal, an entrenched
Washington politician who's out of touch with the electorate.
   Levin depicts himself as a hard-working and effective
representative of Michigan's interests. He attacks Schuette as a
habitual distorter of the truth.
   To date, the advantage has been all Levin's in his campaign for
re-election.
   Schuette's approach is ``pretty bizarre,'' says Levin campaign
manager Gordon Kerr.
   ``He's started beating the drum for `Throw the bums out,' but
he's one of the bums,'' says Kerr.
   True, Levin, a Democrat, has been in the Senate 12 years.
   But Schuette, a Republican member of the House Budget Committee,
has been in Congress for six. Schuette points out that Levin has
been in public life in various capacities for 23 years, but the
impression this has made on the voters appears to be
inconsequential.
   Levin has had essentially the same lead since August, with the
latest poll showing his support at 60 percent to 26 percent for
Schuette.
   The campaign has seen its share of attack ads.
   Schuette accused Levin of voting to raise or protect his pay 22
times and tied Levin into the S&amp;L mess. Levin has gotten $29,000 in
contributions over the years from people associated with the
savings and loan industry.
   Kerr referred to the ad as ``fictions, distortions and
innuendos.'' Levin is returning a $9,000 pay raise to the Treasury
and has voted against pay raises on other occasions. He also
returned $10,000 to various donors involved in civil or criminal
S&amp;L probes.
   A Levin TV ad featured newspaper headlines, some of them from
editorial pages, saying such things as ``The Schuette Deception''
and ``perjury ... phony.''
   Kerr expects Levin's lead to narrow in the final weeks as
Schuette steps up his television advertising.
   ``We've got some Republican votes that Schuette ought to be able
to chip away at if he develops a message that connects with people
and they can get it out,'' said Kerr.
   Schuette dismisses the polls as ``bunk.''
   ``The graveyards out there are littered with the bodies of
candidates who were ahead in September and October and lost in
November,'' says the congressman.
   Schuette's last campaign finance report, released in July,
showed he had raised $1.5 million.
   Kerr says the Levin campaign is approaching its $6 million goal.
   ``The only problem is we've spent most of it,'' said Kerr.
``We've been on TV virtually nonstop since the Fourth of July.''
   Levin is telling voters ``who Bill Schuette is and what he
stands for,'' says political pollster and consultant Steve
Mitchell. ``Any time your opponent defines who you are, you're in
trouble.''
   Mitchell concludes it will take a miracle for Schuette to
overcome Levin's lead.
   Schuette tries to use the ongoing budget battle in Washington to
build up an anti-incumbent sentiment against Levin.
   ``It's the gang in charge that's the problem,'' said Schuette.
   ``There's a wave that's coming across the country'' and people
``want to limit terms and they say we've got to have spending
reductions instead of raising taxes,'' he says. ``It doesn't matter
how much money Carl Levin puts on TV, it's not going to sweeten the
electorate's appetite for more of the same.''
   However, Kerr says Levin ``is on the side of average Michigan
families and he has an effective record of doing things that affect
their lives.''

<HEAD>Latest Breakdown on Foreigners in Iraq, Kuwait</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Following is the breakdown of the number of foreigners in Iraq
and Kuwait as of Oct. 10. Most estimates are based on embassy
registrations.
   An undetermined number of U.S., British, French and West German
citizens are being held in Iraq and Kuwait as human shields around
strategic targets. Others are believed hiding in Kuwait. Some
foreigners, mostly women married to Iraqis or Kuwaitis, have
elected to stay.
   According to U.S. State Department figures, more than 900,000 of
the estimated 3 million foreigners in Kuwait and Iraq on Aug. 2,
when Iraqi forces overran Kuwait, have left.

<HEAD>Gulf Crisis Unleashes Democratic Forces In Feudal Gulf States</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ABNER KATZMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Persian Gulf crisis has unleashed
forces seeking political reforms in the feudal gulf states,
including an extraordinary effort to discuss the future of Kuwait
if it is freed from Iraqi occupation.
   Kuwait's exiled rulers have invited 450 prominent citizens to a
conference in Saudi Arabia this weekend to consider the future
shape of a free Kuwait.
   The government is eagerly - and uncharacteristically -
soliciting the attendance of the Western press at the event.
   Crown Prince Sheik Saad al Abdullah made it clear that the
agenda will range from future defense arrangments to the rights of
Kuwaiti citizens and foreign workers.
   ``The basic topic is liberation,'' Kuwaiti Information Ministry
spokesman Feisal Mutawaa said in a telephone interview from the
conference site in Jiddah.
   ``But all issues that members want to discuss will be
discussed.''
   Sheik Saaid has called for a new social covenant between the
rulers and Kuwaiti citizens. It follows widespread criticism by
Kuwaiti exiles of the domination of the al-Sabahs, Kuwait's deposed
ruling family, over their nation's important financial and
political institutions.
   The debate is raising questions about the mandate of other gulf
rulers, benevolent despots who have so far rejected political
parties and participatory democracy.
   ``No government, anywhere in the world, would fail to take heed
of changing situations by beginning to adjust, whatever the
prevailing situation,'' Sulaiman Mutawaa, minister for planning in
the government-in-exile and Feisal's cousin, said in London this
week.
   After his Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein struck a responsive chord among the Middle East's masses by
claiming that Kuwait was run by a selfish reactionary regime whose
family had hoarded vast wealth for its own benefit.
   To pre-empt such propaganda attacks, the issue of power-sharing
is likely to take center stage in the other gulf states of Saudi
Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, Mideast
experts say.
   However, few observers predict any immediate transformation to
Western-style democracy in a region without such traditions.
   The gulf states are a political anachronism, where oil wealth
and the accompanying support and banking industries have reinforced
a tribal-based feudalism uniqe in modern times.
   The hereditary Bedouin rulers' power is rooted not only in
tradition, but also in their position as the symbolic source of the
oil-fueled largesse that has created some of the world's highest
per capita living standards.
   ``The native populations are all beneficiaries of the welfare
system, except that isn't all they want,'' said Shahram Chubin, a
Middle East specialist who teaches at the Graduate Institute of
International Affairs in Geneva.
   ``The more educated ones want some say in the running of the
country,'' he added. ``It's not that they're excluded from the
benefits. They're excluded from any power-sharing.''
   Both Kuwait and Bahrain have sizeable middle classes and both
have experimented with popular assemblies subordinate to the
rulers' authority.
   Sheik Isa bin Sulman al-Khalifa dissolved Bahrain's 19-month
parliamentary experiment in 1975 after elements in the National
Assembly objected to a docking facilities agreement with the U.S.
Navy.
   Kuwait's 50-member elected Naional Assembly was dissolved by the
emir, Sheik Jaber al-Sabah, in 1986 after Iranian attacks on
Kuwaiti oil installations which delegates blamed in part on the
government's poor security arrangements.
   Shortly before the Aug. 2 invasion, he reinstated the assembly
amid popular pressure for reform, but added 25 appointed members.
   Saddam's invasion, and the subsequent popular support he
garnered throughout the Arab World, have demonstrated the
vulnerability of all the gulf states to destabilizaion by
revolutionary populist forces.
   All have pro-Iranian Shiites and Palestinians forming a large
part of their laboring underclass.
   The gulf's ruling families are all Sunnis Moslems, as are most
of the citizenry.
   The dynasties, some in power for centuries, must ``decide
whether they can restore a significant part of the status quo or
whether the best option is to pre-empt demands for democracy by
taking steps along that road,'' said Mideast analyst Don Kerr of
the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.
   He noted that Jordan, where King Hussein retains a strong
measure of personal loyalty from his subjects, is one of the Arab
world's most politically liberal nations.
   Another issue surfacing is what political rights, if any, should
be granted to the guest workers on which the gulf states depend
heavily.
   The citizens of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are
minorities in their own countries, and the same situation applied
in pre-invasion Kuwait.
   ``They'd have at some point to ask themselves at what juncture
does someone who works there all his life gain the right to
citizenship,'' Kerr said. ``These people don't have any share ...
and this is what Saddam's playing on in Kuwait.''

   Every morning, 90 Iraqi sailors hoist the flag on
their two Esmeraldas-class corvettes, rev their engines and swivel
their 76-millimeter cannons menacingly along the horizon.
   It is a scene that would worry the U.S. military - if it were
not taking place on the sunny Italian Riviera.
   The two corvettes, and eight other warships floating nearby,
were ordered from Italy in 1980. They were to have formed the bulk
of Iraq's most powerful naval fleet ever.
   But as Saddam Hussein's country prepares for war, its would-be
navy is stranded at an Italian military base and a nearby
shipbuilder's docks, a victim of delays and Italian government
embargoes.
   ``It will be very difficult for these ships to ever arrive in
Iraq,'' said Marco Maria Ferranti, spokesman for the Italian
shipbuilder, Fincantieri.
   The shipbuilding deal between Iraq and Italy is an example of
the lucrative arms contracts that Baghdad reached with Western
countries in the past decade.
   For Italy, the $2.6 billion contract was a boon for the
country's sagging shipbuilding industry.
   It called for the state-owned Fincantieri to supply Iraq with
four Lupo-class frigates, each displacing about 2,500 tons and
armed with short-range missiles.
   The company also agreed to build two Esmereldas-class corvettes
and four Wadi-class corvettes, loaded with helicopters, missile and
rocket launchers, and anti-submarine torpedos supplied by other
Italian firms.
   The fleet also included a support ship and a floating dock.
   ``It would have completely transformed the quality and capacity
of their (Iraq's) fleet,'' said Jim McCoy, a naval analyst at the
London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies.
   ``They would have become a force in the Persian Gulf.''
   The first part of the shipbuilding deal, a support ship, headed
for Iraq in 1984. But by then, Iraq was at war with Iran. The ship
could not reach its base at Basra since the Shatt-al-Arab waterway
was blocked. The vessel docked at Alexandria, Egypt - where it
remains.
   In 1986, two corvettes were formally turned over to Iraq. One
hundred Iraqi sailors went to the naval base at La Spezia, 270
miles north of Rome, to train on the ships.
   But later that year, Italy decided to suspend the sale of
military goods to Iran and Iraq. Iraq, which had paid half the
price of the ships, cut off further payments.
   Fincantieri continued to build, hoping the measure was
temporary. Their hopes were raised when the Iran-Iraq war ground to
a halt in 1988.
   Finally, in April, the Italian government announced it was
prepared in principle to let the ships go to Iraq.
   But Iraq decided it wanted some compensation for its long wait.
According to Ferranti, Iraq demanded more helicopters, radar
systems, a high-speed gunboat, shipbuilding plans and a
sophisticated electronic warfare command system.
   The Italian government began to get cold feet. In May, Italian
police seized nearly 100 tons of steel parts on suspicions they
were destined for an alleged Iraqi ``supergun.'' Italy then refused
to let the two Iraqi corvettes go home.
   ``The position of Saddam Hussein certainly wasn't reassuring,''
said a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Alessandro Di Franco.
   In the meantime, Iran, worried about its gulf rival, summoned
the Italian ambassador to protest any turnover of the ships to
Iraq.
   Negotiations on Iraq's demands were stalled by the time it
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. Italy has since observed a U.N. boycott
on trade with Iraq, leaving the ships stuck once again.
   Don Kerr, another analyst at the Institute of Strategic Studies,
says the ships could have been useful now to Iraq - ``at the very
least like a security blanket.'' However, they would have been no
match for the multinational force now in the gulf.
   What will happen to Iraq's would-be navy?
   The ships may be sold to someone else, Ferranti said. However,
such a sale would mean breaking a legal contract with Iraq and
paying it back.
   ``These aren't packets of nuts. They are warships,'' said Di
Franco. ``It's a delicate thing.''
   Fincantieri is losing millions of dollars a year maintaining the
ships it can't deliver, Ferranti said.
   Meanwhile, every day, the 90 Iraqis go through their paces on
their corvettes, running fire drills, swiveling the anti-aircraft
missile ramps and aiming the cannons at imaginary enemies,
officials said. The arms have no ammunition, they said.
   The Italian military keeps an eye on the Iraqis but there are no
restrictions on their movements, said Cmdr. Aldo de Franceschi, the
chief of staff for the Tirrenia region.
   ``I think they're very satisfied to be here,'' he said. ``Here
they are better off. Above all, they are at peace.''

   Audrey Hepurn and Madonna might not know it,
but they have a lot in common where fashion is concerned.
   In fact the looks they helped make famous - the demure 1960s and
the sexy 1990s - combine to make up next year's Italian
spring-summer fashion.
   Models with accentuated eye makeup, in pretty printed A-line
dresses and high heels, and carrying the inevitable handbag, rubbed
elbows down the runway with colleagues wearing bra tops, micro
skirts, derriere-hugging hot pants and more unitards than in all
the performances of ``Cats'' put together.
   Prints were another big 1960 revival item during the
ready-to-wear ``moda Milanese,'' week that ended Thursday, ranging
from the luxurious silk Pucci prints to the Mandrian block prints
to the Couregges black-and-white geometric designs.
   In theory the hot pants and miniskirts were also retro items,
but in practice the short shorts and the daring hemlined skirts
made the 1960's hot pants and miniskirts look like child's play.
   The biggest trendsetter for next year's warmer weather is the
shift dress, which makes a comeback after seasons of layered
fashion. For next season it comes in A-line or trapeze, styles
favored in Hepurn's most famous film, ``Breakfast at Tiffany's.''
The hemline is shorter than 30 years ago, usually around the lower
thigh, giving it a modern flip look.
   The dress is also the only real office apparel in the
collections, devoted mostly to holiday and after-hours fashion.
   The prettiest dresses seen on the runway were at the Mariuccia
Mandelli Krizia collection. They came in navy blue linen with white
lapels and short sleeve cuffs, gaily printed silks, and white
jersey with silver trimming.
   Karl Lagerfeld for Fendi had a series of demure trapeze styles
in navy or bright shades with feminine pleats at the back. Giorgio
Armani preferred them in stretch brocade to be worn over silk
shorts, the pivoting item of his collection. Ferre and Versace
spiced them up with plunging or see-through bodices and extra short
hemlines.
   The revival styles paired with red light district fashion seemed
to reflect the present mood of Italian fashion.
   While the designers still want to maintain the tailored look
that put them at the top of labeled ready-to-wear in the 1980's,
they are in search of tempting new styles that will make women
forget their shrinking pocketbook.
   The result is both good and bad.
   As one U.S. buyer put it, ``There are always rich people ready
to buy expensive extravagant clothes. What is missing are items for
the client who wants well-tailored sensible clothes.''
   Buyers this season are cutting down their orders, plagued by a
recession fears back home, a falling dollar, and a wholesale
increase of over 20 percent.
   The designer who stopped the Milan show for extravagance was
Beverly Hills favorite Gianni Versace with his breathtaking printed
outfits, from the catsuits with matching color scheme shoes and
jewelry, to the multicolored sequined jackets depicting Andy Warhol
Vogue covers, of such stars as Marilyn Monroe, James Dean and
Madonna.
   The sexiest show in town was the Dolce and Gabbana collection
with its sequined bra tops, bare midriffs, chiffon skirtlets and
shimmery hot pants, all accompanied by thigh stockings.
   The two Sicilian designers, Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana,
are considered one of the up-and-coming labels of a fashion scene
perceived by some to be lacking new blood.
   Another new name on the circuit is Moschino who pokes fun at his
colleagues by layering each outfit on the runway with every style
and trend imaginable.
   His shows are always very entertaining, and on closer
examination contain many good wearable pieces. Favorite items for
next season were the red pant suit with the words ``waist of
money'' embroidered in gold letters around the waistline of the
jacket, and a shift dress with the map of Italy stiched down the
front.
   Far from the crowd, in an elegant showroom, the Spanish designer
Sybilla showed her clothes to editors and buyers by appointment.
   The new collection is minimal fashion at its best.
   Three ideas proved that Sybilla knows where fashion is going:
   -a black gown that was pieced together with transparent nylon
thread so that it looked like each seperate piece was suspended on
the body;
   -a wrap-around dress made up of a jersey shawl with arm holes
that you put on by criss-crossing it over the body, the answer to
the elgant traveler's prayer;
   -and a ``mail order'' catalogue depicting each item in the
collection for a quick understanding of what Sybilla is all about.
   On Wednesday night, Giorgio Armani, still the safest and most
consistently beautiful label in Milan, closed the spring-summer
1991 collections.
   For daytime he offered the softest, most feminine gray business
suits, worn with crisp white blouses and a chic unknotted tie. The
new blazer has petal slits on the side, lapels, but no collar.
   The central item of the collection are shorts, which Armani uses
under daytime jackets as well as an alternative to underwear in his
long evening gowns slit up the front.

   Danny sent the scores from the
Bronco game. Melissa said her fish was dead. Amy wanted to know if
there is going to be a war.
   The fifth grade class at Mary Blair Elementary School in
Loveland, Colo., has adopted Lt. Col Arnold Laidig Jr., 45, as
their link to events in the Persian Gulf.
   Seven letters arrived Thursday, bringing the colonel's haul to
11, and he is thrilled.
   ``It's a tie for me back to the real world, life goes on,'' said
the Army public affairs officer. ``It's a different perspective,
it's a refreshing perspective. It's great to get.''
   The class adopted the colonel, from Alexandria, Va., because
Danny, his 10-uear-old nephew, is one of the pupils.
   The letters were a mix of personal anecdotes and questions about
the situation in the gulf.
   Melissa was one of the most talkative, saying: ``I have one cat,
and I used to have a fish. My brother's fish ate it. I need to get
a new one.''
   Then she starts asking about his life:
   ``I wonder what it's like over there. I bet it's kind of scary.
I just looked on the map. I found where you are. It is a long way
away.''
   Doug, even at a distance, managed to hit the nail on the head
about the prevailing attitude among soldiers and journalists with
his question.
   ``I only have one question and that is what is it like to be
sitting out there doing nothing but waiting there to see if
anything happens?''

   The arrival of October has brought a slight easing in the fierce
desert temperatures that kept troops inactive for much of the day.
   The mercury has started to fall, with the water in storage tanks
actually too cold in the morning for some people's taste for
showers.
   Daytime temperatures, while still high by most standards, are
down 10 to 20 degrees from the 115-degree norm in August, when the
soldiers started to arrive.
   ``A couple days ago it was 95 and that was magnificent,'' said
Col. Burt Tackaberry, 43, of Jacksonville, Fla., the commanding
officer of the 24th Infantry division's Aviation Brigade.
   ---
   Many troops are also getting their first phone calls home and
its always a toss up who is more surprised the caller or the
recipient in the United States.
   One staff sergeant, sitting in the middle of a tractless waste
of sand, got through to his wife in Camp Pendleton, Calif., via
satellite link.
   He was obviously having trouble getting a word in edgewise as he
kept saying into the phone: ``Uh hon ... honey ... honey.''
   Finally he bellowed: ``Honey! Shut up! I love you!''

   Bruce Willis doesn't want to forget his humble
beginnings, so he still pays rent on a rundown Manhattan apartment.
   ``To me, it's a reminder of where I came from. That's one memory
I don't want to lose,'' Willis said in the Oct. 14 issue of Parade
magazine.
   Before there was ``Moonlighting'' or ``Die Hard'' and ``Die Hard
2,'' Willis supported himself in New York by working as a bartender
and security guard.
   He earned a combined $10 million for the two ``Die Hard''
movies.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Producer Steve Tisch and Roy Orbison's widow,
Barbara Orbison, are working on a movie about the rock 'n' roll
pioneer.
   ``I liked that Steve saw the picture the way I saw the picture,
a story with heart and inspiration, about a man's journey and not
just about rock 'n' roll but the human side of it,'' Mrs. Orbison
said.
   Orbison was known for such rock classics as ``Pretty Woman'' and
``Only the Lonely.''
   The movie will cover his life from his childhood in a small
Texas town during the Depression to his death from a heart attack
in 1988 at age 52.
   ``Roy had a tremendous life. It had severe ups, like being best
male vocalist in 1964, to the severe downs, like tragedies of his
losing a wife and kids,'' Mrs. Orbison said. The two were married
in 1969.
   She and Tisch, whose credits include the movie ``Risky
Business,'' hope to settle on a writer and director this year and
begin filming next spring. Tisch said negotiations were under way
with Warner Bros. to finance and distribute the movie.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Bruce Springsteen will join Bonnie Raitt and
Jackson Browne for a concert next month to raise money for a
non-profit group that is waging a lawsuit accusing the United
States of involvement in the drug trade.
   It will be Springsteen's first official concert appearance since
1988, when he participated in the Amnesty International world tour.
   Tickets ranging from $25 to $100 go on sale Sunday for the Nov.
16 concert at Shrine Auditorium.
   The fund-raiser will benefit the Washington-based Christic
Institute, which monitors law and public policy.
   The concert will help finance a lawsuit alleging U.S. officials
sanctioned illegal gun and drug sales to finance covert operations
during the Iran-Contra affair.

   EASTON, Conn. (AP) - Actor Hume Cronyn got permission to build
an apartment for live-in help after arguing that his wife,
Oscar-winning actress Jessica Tandy, is ailing and that his
eyesight is failing.
   Miss Tandy, 81, and Cronyn, 79, were turned down in August for a
zoning waiver but were approved Tuesday by the Zoning Board of
Appeals.
   ``Old age is a hardship,'' Cronyn told the panel. ``One that
you'll be dealing with over the years.''
   The apartment on their property would be for a driver or
attendant, Cronyn said. He said the need had become more urgent
since Miss Tandy was hospitalized for a heart condition following
surgery. Cronyn did not disclose the nature of her surgery.
   Miss Tandy, who won an Oscar for her role as an elderly woman
who needed a chauffeur in ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' has suffered from
angina for 10 years.
   Cronyn also said a driver may become necessary because his
eyesight is failing. ``I don't know how long we'll go on driving or
looking after our place,'' he told the board.

   LONDON (AP) - The Duke and Duchess of York have new digs,
Sunninghill Park near Windsor Castle.
   The duke, Queen Elizabeth II's son Andrew, and his wife, Sarah,
along with their two daughters, completed the move Thursday.
   Andrew took time off from his job as flight commander of the
Royal Navy frigate Cambletown to make the move.
   The two-story, red brick house is set in walled grounds on five
acres about 20 miles west of London. Included are tennis courts and
a swimming pool.
   The cost of the home was not disclosed.

<HEAD>House OKs Arts Endowment Extension Without Obscenity Curbs</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Lead prospects uncertain; House floor debate not expected

   When Rep. Pat Williams won his House floor
battle to rescue the National Endowment for the Arts from
conservative attack, he happily lost a $1 bet to an old Montana
cowboy.
   Six months ago, Williams says, he was convinced that the federal
arts agency wouldn't survive the political controversy over NEA
support for arts projects that its critics consider obscene and
blasphemous.
   The Montana Democrat, a staunch NEA supporter, said an elderly
cowboy in his home district bet that Williams would prevail when
the issue reached the House floor.
   Williams owes the cowpoke a buck.
   On Thursday, the House overwhelmingly rejected a move to abolish
the NEA, defeated a proposal to impose tough new anti-obscenity
restrictions and embraced a bipartisan compromise that would leave
the obscenity issue to the courts.
   The compromise bill, drafted by Williams and Rep. E. Thomas
Coleman, R-Mo., after months of intense negotiations, was approved
on a 382-42 roll call vote. The margin surprised Williams.
   ``It was a bigger victory in favor of tolerance and freedom of
expression than I had expected,'' he said. ``The House made it much
easier for members of the Senate to save the NEA.''
   Like a similar measure awaiting Senate floor action, the House
bill would shift from the NEA to the courts the burden of deciding
whether federally subsidized arts projects are obscene.
   Under the bill, grant recipients who are subsequently convicted
of using their federal funds to create works that violate obscenity
laws would be required to return their grant money to the NEA. Once
they do, they would be eligible to apply for new endowment grants.
   The House measure also would order reforms in the NEA's
grant-making procedures with the aim of making them more responsive
to the taxpaying public. In a provision pushed by Republicans, the
bill would increase the share of NEA grant money allocated to the
states from 20 percent to 35 percent over the next three years.
   The bill would extend the NEA's statutory authority for three
years, instead of the usual five years, and would declare that
works violating the Supreme Court's obscenity standard ``shall not
be funded.''
   Current restrictions, imposed by Congress a year ago at the
urging of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., forbid NEA financing of works
that ``may be considered obscene,'' including depictions of
homosexual and sadomasochistic activities and sexual exploitation
of children.
   The House planned to begin debate later today on a separate
appropriations bill that would boost the NEA's budget from $171
million to $180 million in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
   Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, obtained permission to introduce a
floor amendment to the money bill that would forbid NEA financing
of obscene or indecent art. His proposal also would require the
endowment chairman to ensure that NEA-supported works are
``appropriate for a general audience.''
   Williams and Coleman said that if Regula's amendment is tacked
onto the money bill, they will seek to replace it with the terms of
their measure so the House will take a uniform position on the NEA
in both bills.
   During an emotional, five-hour debate on the NEA bill Thursday,
the House defeated, 361-64, a move by Rep. Philip Crane, R-Ill., to
abolish the NEA.
   Then, it rejected, 249-175, a proposal by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher,
R-Calif., to impose stringent new anti-obscenity curbs on NEA
grants.
   This would include a ban on financing works that depict
``sexually explicit conduct'' or child pornography, attack
religion, defile the American flag or include ``an actual human
embryo or fetus.''
   Rohrabacher warned his colleagues that ``the American people are
watching this debate'' on television, implying that lawmakers who
opposed his amendment would face the wrath of voters in the Nov. 6
elections.
   He denounced the Williams-Coleman bill as a fraud, and
challenged the House to ``set standards so our tax dollars are not
channeled into subsidizing child pornography or attacks on
Christianity.''
   Rohrabacher's opponents charged that his proposal was an
unconstitutional attempt to intimidate artists and squelch freedom
of expression for political gain.

<HEAD>Father of Quadriplegic Who Sought to End His Life Dies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who had been his quadriplegic son's sole
caretaker for 12 years died of lung cancer, a week after he
apparently helped his son end his life so the young man wouldn't be
left alone.
   Robert Bergstedt, 64, died Thursday at Nathan Adelson Hospice,
said his attorney. He checked into the hospital after his
31-year-old son, Kenneth, died last week.
   Both deaths came before the Nevada Supreme Court ruled on
Kenneth Bergstedt's petition that he be allowed to end his life
without threat of legal recourse against anyone who helped him die.
   ``I think the story of Robert's care of his son is really an
epic story of eternal love,'' Supreme Court Justice Cliff Young
said. ``If anybody's deserving of being considered for canonization
or sainthood, I think Robert would be a nominee.''
   Kenneth Bergstedt sought to end his life for fear his father,
his sole companion, would not be around to take care of him. In
court papers he said he found little fulfillment in life, which he
spent strapped to a gurney and hooked to a respirator.
   A lower court had ruled in his favor but asked that he postpone
his death until the Supreme Court could rule.
   ``I've lost two very close friends in the last week,'' said
attorney Jack Cherry.
   Cherry said Bergstedt lost a leg in a 1947 industrial accident,
his wife died of cancer in 1978 and he had cared for his son since
a swimming accident in 1969 left him crippled. Bergstedt was
diagnosed last month as having cancer.
   ``How tough can one family have it?'' the lawyer said. ``Any
time you think you've got it tough, take a look at these folks.
Everything's relative.''
   Kenneth Bergstedt was found dead Oct. 4 in the mobile home he
and his father shared. The coroner's office said it was awaiting
toxicology tests before ruling on the cause of death.
   Robert Bergstedt told the Las Vegas Sun last week that he gave
his son sedatives and loosened his respirator after his son told
him he could not live any longer.
   But police said Bergstedt told them his son's respirator had
accidentally worked loose and that he had awakened to find Kenneth
Bergstedt dead.
   Young said the Supreme Court plans to rule on the right-to-die
case anyway.
   ``We could say it's moot because Kenneth is dead, but the court
has pretty well indicated it wants to face the issue directly,'' he
said.

   Five demonstrators chained themselves
to the gates of the Soviet consulate today to publicize the arrests
of a Greenpeace crew by the Soviet Union four days earlier.
   The protesters were demanding that Soviet authorities allow a
resumption of radio contact between the 34-member crew of the
vessel MV Greenpeace and the enviromental group's London
headquarters, said Greenpeace spokeswoman Michelle Grosvenor.
   She said the protesters will remain chained to the consulate
gates until radio contact is resumed and the safety of the crew
guaranteed.
   The crew, including an Austrialian and and at least one
American, was seized Monday by the KGB while protesting a planned
nuclear weapons test on the Soviet archipelago of Novaya Zemlya.
   A Soviet Foreign Ministry statement released Thursday said the
Greenpeace ship was being towed to the Murmansk where the crew
would be handed over to authorities.

   It's taking longer than President Bush
predicted, but the United States and the Soviet Union are only
months away from signing two of the most significant arms reduction
treaties in history.
   One would rid Europe of thousands of tanks, airplanes,
antiaircraft artillery pieces and armored troop carriers. Most of
the cuts would be in Soviet weapons.
   The other pact would trim U.S. and Soviet long-range nuclear
missiles by about 30 percent overall. Hundreds of warheads would be
scrapped under tight supervision.
   The European treaty is the most comprehensive arms control
accord in history. The U.S.-Soviet strategic arms reduction accord,
meanwhile, deals with the deadliest weapons and, at 400 to 500
pages, is of unprecedented length.
   Bush predicted the conventional weapons treaty would be ready by
last June at the latest. It looks like it will be ready in
mid-November. The heads of the 16 North Atlantic Treaty
Organization countries and the six Warsaw Pact nations will sign
the treaty in Paris at a glittering summit meeting.
   Bush hoped to sign the START accord with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow in December. There is a slim chance
of that. U.S. officials say early next year is more likely.
   Deadlines are not the main consideration. Harnessing the race in
conventional and nuclear weapons, once a visionary dream, is about
to become a reality.
   Incredibly, the historic development has not captured the
public's imagination. One reason is that the end of the Cold War
already has soothed nuclear war nerves. Gorbachev is committed to
withdrawing many of the tanks to be cut under the treaty, along
with the troops that accompany them. Bush has ordered more modest
cuts.
   The Conventional Forces in Europe treaty will make cutbacks
legally binding, however. And it will establish a framework for
even deeper reductions later on.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze cleared the last roadblocks in New
York last week. These involved limits on land-based airplanes and
verification procedures against cheating.
   The two officials were unable, however, to resolve the remaining
differences in the strategic arms reduction treaty. The four key
ones are:
   -The restrictions to be imposed on transfers to allies of
weapons barred under the treaty. This mostly involves U.S. nuclear
submarine technology for Britain.
   -The restrictions to be imposed on improving the Soviet SS-18
intercontinental ballistic missiles.
   -Whether the Soviet Backfire bomber is to be classified as a
long-range weapon under the treaty and made subject, therefore, to
limitations.
   -Procedures for verifying the destruction of the bombers,
submarines and missiles outlawed under the treaty.
   Baker indicated last Friday that his talks with Shevardnadze
tripped over the transfer issue and that the SS-18 and Backfire
problems could be settled once what arms controllers call
non-circumvention is cleared up.
   ``In every nuclear negotiation the Soviets press us on
cooperation with Britain and they have acceded ultimately every
time,'' a U.S. official said Thursday. ``Personally I am optimistic
that we'll settle this one.''
   The Backfire bomber also has dogged U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms
talks for a long time.
   The Soviets insist the weapon is of medium-range. The United
States insists the Backfire can span oceans and should be
restricted both in range and in number.
   The solution may be an agreement outside the treaty in which the
Soviets volunteer to curb Backfire.
   The SS-18 issue causes the most concern among conservatives in
Congress. Some were ready to crucify Baker a few months ago when he
tentatively agreed to some tests of the missile, the deadliest in
the Soviet arsenal.
   The Soviets already have agreed to cut their SS-18 stockpile in
half - from 308 to 154. The question is at what point improvements
in the existing SS-18 amount to creation of an illegal new weapon.
   The official, who gave The Associated Press a progress report
under conditions of anonymity, cautioned: ``I would not downgrade
the importance of the specifics of verification.''
   Among the tough items are the procedures for inspecting missile
plants to guard against the production of illegal weapons.
   ``They require long hours and a lot of work and focus, but that
doesn't mean it's impossible,'' the official said.

   Bishop George Carey, the next archbishop of
Canterbury, says he tried to steal chocolate bars from a freight
train when he was 8 years old.
   The bishop recalls that he was caught by a nightwatchman and
what he thought was a box of chocolate Mars bars turned out to be a
box of Bibles.
   He said his captor pulled out a Bible and told him: ``Here's one
that will do you more good.''
   ``Looking back on 46 years, I am sure it has,'' says Carey in a
new book of childhood memories by 70 personalities, ``When They
Were Young.''
   The book published by Radcliffe Press is to go on sale at the
end of the month, with proceeds to help children suffering from
cancer and leukemia victims.
   Carey, 54, is a hospital porter's son and grew up on a municipal
housing development in east London.
   In January, he will succeed Archbishop Robert Runcie as
spiritual head of the Church of England and leader of the world's
70 million Anglicans, including 2 million U.S. Episcopalians.

<TEXT>
   When students at a Roman Catholic school
here recite the Pledge of Allegiance, they promise loyalty to a
country that offers liberty and justice ``for the born and the
unborn.''
   The principal at Lorain Catholic High School said she and
faculty members added the phrase this week to reflect the church's
anti-abortion stance.
   Some of the school's 400 students in this town 35 miles west of
Cleveland said that they were not ordered to recite the phrase to
the end of the pledge but that they feel pressured to do so and
resent it.
   ``It's like changing the Constitution,'' junior Angela Martinez
said Thursday.
   Others said the anti-abortion sentiment should be expected in a
Catholic schoo.
   Senior Meghan Chapple said the change gave the same emphasis and
values behind Catholic prayers. Of those who disaprove, she said,
``They're at a Catholic school and should be expected to (uphold)
the Catholic values.''
   Some students had threatened to boycott classes Thursday to
protest the change. But students questioned after school said they
had not skipped classes and did not know if others had.
   Principal Joanne Miller said the amended pledge was appropriate
and that no students had protested.
   ``Students come here by choice. They do not come here because
this is their district. And when they come they agree to our
policies and our philosophy,'' she said.
   This week has been designated ``respect for life'' week at
Catholic schools around the nation. Students are being urged to
reflect on the issues of abortion, euthanasia, the homeless and
poverty.
   Robert Kealey, executive director for the National Catholic
Education Association in Washington, said he had not heard of any
other school altering the Pledge of Allegiance. The association
represents most of the nation's Catholic secondary and elementary
schools.
   Jerry Lackamp, spokesman for the Catholic Diocese of Cleveland,
said referring to the unborn in the pledge is not policy for
Catholic schools in northeastern Ohio.
   Some students said they recite the pledge, then stop at the new
part.
   ``A lot of students, when they say the pledge, say `justice for
all' and then sit down, and you just hear the rest over the P.A.
system,'' said Marcie Apont, an eighth-grader.

<HEAD>Bumper Corn Crop in Prospect, USDA Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of their yields have been shaved by dry
weather, but farmers nationally are harvesting a bumper corn crop
this fall, according to new estimates by the Agriculture
Department.
   Production was estimated Thursday at 8.02 billion bushels, up 7
percent from last year's crop. That's the most since the 1986
harvest of 8.23 billion bushels.
   However, the new estimate by the department's Agricultural
Statistics Board was down 1 percent from last month's forecast of
8.12 billion bushels.
   ``Early in September, lack of moisture in the western Corn Belt
caused deteriorating crop conditions,'' the board's report said.
``Crop conditions lagged furthest behind in Illinois, Indiana and
Missouri.''
   Farmers harvested 7.53 billion bushels in 1989, and the
department in its initial 1990 forecast on Aug. 9 put this fall's
harvest at 7.85 billion bushels before raising it last month.
   John A. Schnittker of Schnittker Associates, a Washington-based
consulting firm, said the forecast is ``almost equal to the amount
of corn we will need in the next 12 months'' to meet domestic and
export demands now projected.
   But the bad news, he said, is that ``this corn crop coincides
with a glut in wheat, especially.'' Big wheat producers, including
the United States, are subsidizing exports in an effort to unload
surpluses.
   ``The big wheat crop glutting the world market and the
subsidization of wheat, pushing it below corn prices, is the real
problem,'' Schnittker said.
   Based on Oct. 1 surveys, corn yields were estimated at a record
120.3 bushels per acre harvested, compared with 116.2 bushels last
year and 121.7 bushels indicated last month. The old record was
119.4 bushels in 1987.
   As livestock feed, corn is the largest and most important U.S.
farm crop and is essential for the production of meat, poultry and
dairy products.
   Consumer food prices, which rose an average of 5.8 percent in
1989, the sharpest year-to-year increase since 1981, are expected
to climb an additional 5 percent to 7 percent in 1990.
   Soybean production, a source of high-protein meal and vegetable
oil, was estimated at 1.82 billion bushels, down 5 percent from
last year's harvest of 1.93 billion bushels and 1 percent below the
September forecast of 1.83 billion bushels.
   Cotton production was indicated at 14.5 million bales, up 19
percent from last year's output of 12.2 million bales but down 1
percent from the September forecast.
   The revised estimates showed total wheat production at 2.74
billion bushels, up 35 percent from the 1989 harvest but down
slightly from last month.
   The department's all-crops production index was reported at 111
percent of its 1977 average used for comparison, down one
percentage point from September but still the highest reading since
the index averaged 116 percent in 1985.
   In a related report on supply and demand for major commodities,
analysts said total corn use in the 1990-91 marketing year that
began Sept. 1 is expected to be about 8.095 billion bushels,
including domestic and export requirements.
   With demand slightly exceeding 1990 corn production, that will
mean a decrease in U.S. corn stockpiles to about 1.273 billion
bushels left over by Sept. 1, 1991.
   But the downturn would be modest compared with 1989, when the
corn stockpile plummeted from 4.26 billion bushels on Sept. 1, 1988
to 1.93 billion bushels on hand last Sept. 1.
   The report said U.S. corn prices may average in the range of
$2.20 to $2.60 per bushel in the 1990-91 marketing year, up 10
cents from the September projection. Corn prices at the farm
averaged about $2.36 per bushel last season.
   No significant changes were reported in the U.S. wheat supply
and demand situation, and prices at the farm are expected to
average $2.55 to $2.85 per bushel this marketing year from $3.72 in
1989-90.
   Soybean prices at the farm were forecast at $5.70 to $7 per
bushel in 1990-91, compared with $5.70 the past marketing year.
That was up 20 cents on the lower end of the range in September.
   Other 1990 crop estimates based on Oct. 1 indications, compared
with 1989 output, included:
   -Sorghum, 561.9 million bushels and an average yield of 60.7
bushels per acre, compared with 617.9 million and 55.4 in 1989.
   -Rice, 158 million hundredweight and a yield of 5,629 pounds per
acre, compared with 154.5 million and 5,749.
   -Peanuts, 3.36 billion pounds and a yield of 1,917 pounds per
acre, compared with 3.99 billion and 2,426.
   -Tobacco, 1.58 billion pounds and a yield of 2,166 pounds per
acre, compared with 1.37 billion and 2,016.
   -Sugar beets, 27.1 million tons and a yield of 19.89 tons per
acre, compared with 25.1 million and 19.4.
   -Sugar cane, 25.7 million tons and a yield of 35.7 tons per
acre, compared with 29.4 million and 34.5.

<HEAD>Cheney Will Press Soviets for Intelligence on Iraqi Military</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney plans to press
Soviet government officials for secret information about the Iraqi
military while he's in Moscow next week, an aide said.
   Cheney is scheduled to meet with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev on Wednesday, as well as with Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze and Defense Minister Dimitri Yazov. Cheney also will
meet with Soviet political reform leaders.
   The Cheney aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Thursday that Moscow had not responded to previous U.S. requests
for detailed intelligence on Iraqi weapons, most of which were
designed and built by Soviets.
   The Soviets have provided American officials with general
assessments of Iraqi intentions regarding the occupation of Kuwait
but nothing more specific, the official said.
   Last month Soviet KGB chairman Vladimir A. Kryuchkov said in an
interview with The Associated Press that Moscow was willing to
share intelligence on Iraq with Washington but hadn't made the
offer directly because it has been rebuffed in the past by the CIA.
   Nearly all the estimated 3,500 Iraqi tanks deployed in Kuwait
and southern Iraq and many of that country's military aircraft are
of Soviet design. U.S. officials claim that several hundred Soviet
technical specialists are in Iraq advising Iraqi military officials
on maintaining warplanes and other Soviet-built equipment.
   Cheney is scheduled to arrive in Moscow on Tuesday. His will be
the second visit to that country by an American secretary of
defense. Cheney's predecessor, Frank Carlucci, was there in 1988.
   Cheney will hold meetings with British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and her defense secretary, Tom King, in London on Monday
before flying to Moscow. He will stop in Paris on his way back from
Moscow on Oct. 19 to meet with President Francois Mitterrand and
Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement.
   The London and Paris meetings will focus mainly on the status of
arms control negotiations and on prospects for redefining the role
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Pentagon official
said. He said the Persian Gulf crisis was not expected to be a
major topic.
   The Pentagon official said that although Cheney would press the
Soviets for specific intelligence on the Iraqi military,
discussions on the gulf crisis would be secondary to questions
about Soviet economic, social and political reform.
   He said Cheney would stress to the Soviets that the Bush
administration is planning major cuts in defense spending, plus the
withdrawal of more than 40,000 troops from Western Europe. This
will be highlighted in hopes of encouraging the Soviets to carry
through with their declared intentions of reducing military
strength, the official said.

   Big-band leader Xavier Cugat has been
placed on a respirator three days after his admission to a hospital
for heart and lung trouble, his doctors said.
   The 90-year-old Cugat, who made the rumba popular in America,
was in serious condition in intensive care when he was placed on
the respirateor Thursday, according to a statement by doctors Jorge
Rius and Jaime Pujadas.
   ``They are waiting to see how he responds to the treatment,'' a
hospital spokeswoman said.
   Cugat checked into the Quiron Clinic Monday with a lung
infection and trouble in his left ventricle. Similar problems have
forced him into the hospital 27 times since 1980, the doctors said.
   Cugat is generally credited with introducing tropical rythms
into American dance music in the 1930s. He and his band were
featured in several popular Hollywood movies.
   He retired in 1970 and a decade later moved to Barcelona, the
capital of the Catalonia region where he was born Jan. 1, 1900.

<HEAD>Budget, Bonds and Big Shots: Will The City Be Saved From Itself?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vast budget gaps, bond-rating woes and
finger-pointing by big shots - New York's crisis has all the marks
of the city's near-bankruptcy 15 years ago. But fiscal watchdogs
say there won't be a reprise of 1975.
   That was the year New York pleaded for a federal rescue and the
Daily News scored with the headline ``Ford to City: Drop Dead.''
   It was the year 25,000 city workers, including 5,000 police
officers, were laid off, 8,000 substitute teachers were fired and
services were slashed.
   This year, the headlines trumpet fiscal warnings that seemingly
are as perilous, as the economy goes downhill regionally and
nationally.
   Mayor David N. Dinkins, 10 months in office, is plugging a $1.8
billion budget deficit just three months into the fiscal year and
grappling with a gap for next year.
   The first week of October epitomized the city's struggle to
limit spending without gutting services.
   First, the city gave teachers a 5.5 percent raise in a one-year
contract settlement. Critics said the amount was too generous and
would set a bad example for negotiations with 250,000 other city
workers.
   Responding to a summer crime wave, Dinkins let loose a criminal
justice plan with a $1.9 billion price tag. Leaders in the state
Legislature promptly said they would block the taxes Dinkins called
for to finance the package.
   Dinkins then imposed a hiring freeze and said he was considering
laying off 15,000 workers because of declining revenue.
   The jobless rate in the city hit 7.9 percent in September, up
from 6.2 percent in August.
   To top it off, Standard and Poor's announced Tuesday it has
placed the city's $13 billion in general obligation bonds on
``credit watch,'' meaning the city's bond rating might be lowered.
Bond markets have been tumbling since, forcing higher borrowing
costs on the city.
   Then came the name-calling. Former Mayor Edward I. Koch accused
Labor Commissioner Eric Schmertz of helping teachers take Dinkins
``to the cleaners.''
   Schmertz said Koch was indulging in ``monumental bitchiness''
and had been involved in the most corrupt administration since
Jimmy Walker's in the 1920s.
   Dinkins had to weather bad publicity over a headboard for his
bed as he was urging belt-tightening. The headboard reportedly cost
$11,500. The administration said that whatever the cost, it would
be covered privately.
   So how bad is the situation, compared with 1975?
   ``Not the same, not as bad,'' said Edward V. Regan, state
comptroller. ``In those days in 1975, the city was unable to
borrow, basically unable to pay its bills in a lot of ways.''
   Hyman C. Grossman, Standard &amp; Poor's managing director, said,
``We expect (the city) to pull it out, but we have a bigger
question mark, which is why we have a credit watch.''
   ``The situation is lousy, it's awful, but it's not calamitous,''
said Herbert Bienstock, who was director of the local U.S. Bureau
of Labor Statistics from 1962 to 1980 and heads a Queens College
research unit.
   The major differences between then and now, the analysts agreed,
is that the city was not prepared to handle the crisis of '75.
   Harrison Goldin said that when he became city comptroller in
1974, the city ``didn't have the foggiest idea'' where its money
was. As it turned out, some was in shoeboxes tucked in closets,
where Goldin said he found billions of dollars worth of deposits
from contractors and negotiable municipal bonds.
   The city, he said, ``didn't have the basic information to run a
corner candy store.''
   Very true, agreed Elinor B. Bachrach, now deputy state
comptroller for New York City. From 1975 to 1981 she was on the
staff of Sen. William Proxmire's Senate banking committee, where
the city turned for help.
   ``In those days the city couldn't even tell how much its deficit
was, how many people it had on its payroll,'' Bachrach said.
   Despite President Ford's opposition to a bailout, the city
pulled through 1975, after new fiscal constraints and monitoring
were imposed and the feds coughed up $2.3 billion in short-term
loans.
   The restraints included a law that the city's budget must
balance, creation of Bachrach's office of deputy comptroller to
monitor the city's finances and creation of a special
belt-tightening board. They are the same restraints expected to
save the city from itself this time.
   ``In a certain sense, you are seeing the system work, not the
system not working,'' said Regan. ``My guess is, other than the
economy eroding, the mayor will come to grips with this. It won't
get worse.''

<HEAD>Chinese Delegation Seeks U.S. Goodwill</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Lead prospects uncertain</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of Chinese government buyers are coming
to the United States today to order American goods, but U.S.
officials believe the main item on their shopping list is
congressional goodwill.
   The delegation - the largest China has sent here - comes as the
House moved toward a vote on the administration's plan to extend
trade benefits to China for another year.
   The benefits, known as Most Favored Nation status, are vital to
China because they slash tariffs on Chinese goods sold in the
United States - China's biggest export market.
   China's trade status was in danger last year after its violent
suppression of a pro-democracy demonstration at Beijing's Tiananmen
Square. Many lawmakers are demanding the administration withhold
the favored trade status unless China improves its human rights
record.
   ``They fully realize congressional sensitivities,'' said David
Denny of the U.S.-China Business Council, a non-profit group
representing U.S. firms doing business in China.
   The invitation was solicited by China on the advice of U.S.
officials and lobbyists who urged them to appease Congress, much as
Taiwan and South Korea do with such missions when their trade
policies come under fire.
   Many members of Congress also are upset over China's trade
surplus with the United States, its increasing import restrictions
against certain U.S. products, and its limits on U.S. investment
opportunities.
   According to U.S. Commerce Department figures, the United States
sold China products worth $5.8 billion last year - mostly wheat,
Boeing aircraft, cotton and wood. The United States bought from
China almost double that amount - $11.99 billion - mostly in
apparel and footwear.
   China, which calculates the trade figures differently, shows a
surplus of only $1.3 billion.
   ``Either way, reducing the surplus, or announcing significant
deals, will do them some good with Congress,'' Denny said.
   Only four lawmakers have agreed to meet with the delegation. The
rest have cited scheduling problems or said they don't want to be
influenced before the vote on China's trade status, said one source
who asked not to be named.
   Despite an administration ban on high-level contacts with
Chinese officials - imposed by President Bush after the Tiananmen
Square massacre - the delegation will meet with Lawrence
Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state, and Thomas Murrin, deputy
secretary of commerce.
   The administration has made other exceptions to this ban, most
recently when Secretary of State James A. Baker III met with his
Chinese counterpart at the United Nations, but each time was
described as an exception.
   Other sanctions imposed by the Bush administration, including a
suspension of weapons sales and strict limits on loans to China,
remain in place.
   Chinese officials have promised to place orders for U.S. goods
worth $200 million or $300 million and negotiate for future
purchases. The team plans to visit Washington, New York, Chicago,
Houston, Los Angeles and Seattle.
   The trade mission ``demonstrates China's determination of
continuing to open to the outside world,'' according to an
announcement by Chinese authorities.
   But U.S. officials and trade experts are skeptical.
   ``It's unclear how many new contracts there'll actually be,''
said one official familiar with the mission. ``They may just sign
contracts already in the pipeline.''
   China's conservative leaders have shown few signs they actually
intend to relax their trade policies, since they began rolling back
from economic liberalization two years ago.
   On the contrary. Responding to a decline in economic growth and
to fears of inflation, as well as the burden of repaying the
country's $40 billion international debt, authorities have
restricted imports.

   An unfinished piece of music by Wolfgang Amadeus
Mozart has been played, possibly for the first time, after a
relative decided to auction off the work composed about 200 years
ago.
   Five students at the Royal College of Music on Thursday
performed the 35 bars of the ``Quintet in B Flat Major'' for piano
and wind instruments, oboe, clarinet, basset horn and bassoon.
   ``They are an unusual group of instruments and I think the work
might not have been completed because Mozart may have found it
difficult to find musicians to play them,'' said Stephen Roe,
director of manuscripts at Sotheby's.
   The firm will auction the music Nov. 21.
   The fragment took 1\ minutes to perform and sounded complete,
although it was only the opening of a work.
   Roe said the single sheet of music was on the same kind of paper
Mozart was using in 1783. He said it was brought to one of their
offices on the European continent by a member of the family who had
preserved it for more than a century and who asked not to be
identified.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court says Nicu Ceausescu
must stay in prison, overturning an earlier decision to release the
youngest son of Romania's late Communist dictator on health
grounds, the Rompres news agency reported.
   Ceausescu would periodically visit state health facilities for
observation, Rompres quoted a Supreme Court statement as saying in
its ruling Thursday.
   A military tribunal on Sept. 18 sentenced Ceausescu to 20 years
for ``incitement to murder'' during last December's revolution that
toppled his father Nicolae Ceausescu, who was later executed.
   A lower court later decided to release the younger Ceausescu for
three months because he was suffering from severe cirrhosis of the
liver and couldn't tolerate jail conditions.
   Ceausescu was initially charged with ``complicity to genocide.''
During the uprising, 89 people were killed in Sibiu, where he had

   Saudi Arabia plans to increase crude oil
production another 10 percent by the middle of next year and will
speed up expansion plans to reach peak output of 10 million barrels
a day by 1995, The Washington Post said in Friday's editions.
   In a dispatch from Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, the newspaper quoted
Saudi oil executives as dismissing reports of problems in the
expansion plan.
   Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company, now produces 7.7
million barrels a day, a 45 percent increase from the 5.3 million
daily barrels it was producing before Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug.
2.
   Kuwait and Iraq had been producing 4.35 million barrels a day,
and that oil was immediately embargoed from world trade.
   Though the extra Saudi production and increases in output
elsewhere have replaced a large fraction of the lost production,
worried buyers have pushed the price of oil in international
markets from about $21 a barrel in July to around $40 now.
   In the late 1970s, Saudi Arabia often produced 10 million
barrels a day, but production was cut back in the 1980s and
facilities were mothballed.
   Reporting on an interview with Nasr Ajmi, executive vice
president of Saudi Aramco, the newspaper said Saudi production
would reach 8 million barrels a day by the end of this year.
   By the middle of 1991, the target is ``8.5 (million) or
better,'' Ajmi was quoted as saying.
   ``We have every reason to believe we can get to that level and
sustain it,'' he said.
   The government had already decided to restore capacity to 10
million barrels a day in the 1990s but now will try to do 10 years
of expansion work in five, the newspaper said.
   Saudi Arabia has by far the largest oil reserves in the world.

<HEAD>Studies Suggest Diet Can Help Prevent Cancer, But Not Treat It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The high fat fare preferred by fast
food-loving Americans is a ``killer diet'' that encourages cancer
growth, but scientists still don't know exactly why rich food seems
to have this effect.
   At a conference Thursday on the effects of diet on cancer,
Creighton University School of Medicine researcher Dr. Henry T.
Lynch said there is good evidence that what Americans eat is
affecting the way many of them die.
   ``The man on the street is eating himself to death with a killer
diet of high calories and high fat,'' said Lynch. ``They are more
vulnerable to cancer. We know that from epidemiological studies.''
   But the precise biological link between diet and the development
of cancer cells is still unknown. Lynch said that despite claims by
some unconventional cancer treatment centers there is no
conclusive, clear evidence that any specific food or diet is an
absolute protection from cancer.
   Lynch, a speaker at a meeting of the American Institute for
Cancer Research, said all that scientists can say for sure is that
a high-fiber, low-fat diet is a ``prudent'' precaution against
cancer.
   This is based on studies of populations in which the occurrence
of cancer is lower than the rate in the United States or in other
countries that have adopted a Western diet, he said.
   Laboratory studies using animals fed special diets have shown
``very appealing evidence'' that some nutrients can protect against
the formation of cancer cells, Lynch said.
   But this does not mean that special diets will have the same
effect among people.
   ``In humans, the data is still preliminary and fragmentary,''
said Lynch. ``When bringing dietary manipulation to a clinical
application, we're still in a gray zone.''
   Once cancer has developed, Lynch said there has been no
reputable research showing that special diets or food supplements
can effectively defeat the disease.
   People with cancer may spend thousands of dollars on
unconventional treatments based on unusual diets, but they are
wasting their money, the researcher said.
   ``There are no anti-cancer dietary supplements,'' said Lynch, a
practicing cancer specialist. ``I know patients who get into that
garbage and it's pathetic.''
   Carmia Borek, a professor at the Tufts University School of
Medicine, said there have been studies showing that low levels of
some nutrients are more common among people with cancer. And she
said that laboratory studies on isolated cells and in animals have
shown that increased levels of some vitamins and other nutrients
can interrupt the development of cancer cells.
   But, she said, there still is no evidence relating these
findings to humans, or proving that dietary manipulation can either
treat or prevent cancer.
   ``We still have to do work on that,'' she said. ``I don't think
we'll have the final evidence for a long time.''
   Lynch said one way to get this evidence would be to study
families in which there is a genetic predisposition for cancer.
   ``There are thousands of families that have been decimated by
cancer,'' he said. Some family members, said Lynch, are destined by
genetics to have a 50-50 chance of developing the disease.
   Using controlled diets in carefully designed studies with these
families, he said, could give ``final answers'' on cancer and diet
in about one generation.
   ``The evidence is very strong that diet is associated with
cancer, but it's not clear if dietary manipulation can prevent the
disease,'' said Lynch. ``The hypothesis has to be tested.''
   A number of federal and private health organizations have said
that the typical American diet includes too much animal fat and too
little complex carbohydrates.
   Some studies have shown that Americans typically consume up to
45 percent of their daily calories from foods rich in fat. The
American Heart Association recommends only 30 percent of a diet
from fat, and some experts said the fat content should be as low as
20 percent.

<HEAD>DeConcini Predicts He'll Be Exonerated in S&amp;L Ethics Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini says nobody should write
his political obituary because of an ethics investigation, and
predicts no wrongdoing will be found in his help for a collapsing
savings and loan.
   The Arizona Democrat, after closed testimony Thursday before the
Senate Ethics Committee, said he's ``confident the truth will
prevail'' and that the six-member panel of his peers ``will
exonerate me.''
   DeConcini and four other senators are under investigation for
the help they gave former savings and loan executive Charles H.
Keating Jr. The businessman and his associates contributed $1.3
million to the five lawmakers' campaigns and causes.
   Congressional sources have said committee special counsel Robert
S. Bennett recommended that there was enough evidence to continue
the ethics investigation against Sens. DeConcini, Alan Cranston of
California and Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan.
   Bennett recommended dismissal for Sens. John Glenn of Ohio and
John McCain of Arizona. McCain is the only Republican in the group.
   DeConcini met with the committee for five hours, punctuated by
several breaks, mostly to answer questions but also to give a
half-hour statement defending his cnduct.
   The committee, which investigates potential violations of Senate
conduct, has met individually with DeConcini, McCain and Glenn.
Cranston and Riegle are scheduled to appear next week.
   DeConcini, a three-term senator who is up for election in 1994,
said the investigation has been a ``very trying time'' for him, but
added, ``I wouldn't write an obituary for Sen. DeConcini if I
decide to run again.''
   The senator contended there was ``no basis'' to allegations by
Common Cause, a group that monitors Congress, that his help for
Keating violated Senate rules. Common Cause's complaint that all
five senators may have broken the rules triggered the preliminary
investigation that began last December.
   DeConcini played an active role for Keating, inviting other
senators to join him in sessions with U.S. banking regulators and
urging banking officials to approve the sale, rather than seizure
of Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan.
   His contacts with regulators continued until the time Lincoln
was brought under federal control in April 1989, a move that could
cost taxpayers more than $2 billion in bailout costs. Lincoln was
based in Irvine, Calif., but Keating's main company, American
Continental Corp., was in Phoenix.
   DeConcini has maintained that his assistance for Keating simply
was representation for a constituent who was a major Arizona
employer.
   The nation's former top thrift regulator, Edwin J. Gray, accused
DeConcini of offering him a deal on Keating's behalf in April 1987,
but the senator and three of his colleagues who were present denied
the proposal was ever made.
   DeConcini received $48,100 in contributions from Keating and
associates, but announced a year ago he was returning the money
because there was a possibility the funds were illegally funneled
from Lincoln.

<TEXT>
   A key Soviet economic adviser says his country
must make ``a very drastic change of the economic and political
system,'' but American business leaders say they expect no quick
bonanza from the Soviet Union's movement toward a market economy.
   Stanislav Shatalin, chief adviser for economics on the
Presidential Council of the U.S.S.R., told the annual Business Week
symposium of chief executive officers Thursday that the Soviet
economic system ``is really hard to call economics at all.''
   ``It has become clear that the very basis of all our crises is
the fact that we have a very inefficient economy,'' Shatalin said.
``This will be very painful because of the fact that we have lagged
behind in this area for many decades, unfortunately.''
   Some attending the conference were skeptical about the prospects
for increased American business from any improvement.
   ``I don't think there is going to be an immediate payoff at
all,'' Warren Bennis, professor of business administration at the
University of Southern California and a member of the board of
United Research, said in an interview.
   ``This has been a bureaucratization that has been going on for
70 years,'' Bennis said. ``It's verging on a hopeless situation
there. Some American know how and some money may help, but I think
it's going to be a much longer time than Eastern Europe.''
   ``I don't see any immediate bottom line implications,'' Bennis
added.
   Richard Ruch, chief executive officer and president of Herman
Miller Inc., said, ``If you are asking me when Russia is really
going to be a market of opportunity, that I'm not so sure of.''
   ``I'm sure eventually it is going to happen,'' he said. ``But we
hear statements that there is an awful lot of work that has to be
done in the Soviet Union.''
   ``I think it depends on what business you are in,'' Ruch said.
``If you are in a business that's got a product that they really
need, now is the time to set up relationships and get going.
   ``But if your product is office furniture, like ours, which is
always a deferrable, postponable type of purchase, maybe it's still
a little bit too early to try to move in.''
   ``But we are going to watch them very closely, because it could
happen faster than we think,'' Ruch added.
   Richard Le Fauve, president of Saturn Corp., was guardedly
hopeful about prospects for improvement in the Soviet economy.
   ``I think it depends on us,'' Le Fauve said. ``If we are willing
to open up and share with the Russian leadership through letting
them visit and learn on the job, so to speak, I think it could
happen very soon. If we become conservative and try to teach
through a lecturing process, I think it will take forever.''
   Shatalin said, ``Without assistance from the West it will be
very difficult to accomplish our reforms.''
   The Soviet official spoke to an audience of about 200 American
executives and their spouses at the National Museum of Women in the
Arts.

   John Tower lied by suggesting that Sen. Jim
Exon drinks too much, says a Senate colleague of Exon.
   ``Mr. Tower's behavior was larval,'' said U.S. Sen. Bob Kerrey,
D-Neb. ``His worm-like lies about one of our best citizens should
leave little doubt why the Senate - reluctantly and with far more
respect than was warranted - did not trust him with America's

   The Senate last year rejected Tower's nomination as secretary of
defense.
   Tower was campaigning Thursday for Republican Hal Daub when he
said that Nebraska Democrat Exon had a reputation for drinking too
much. Tower admitted he had never seen Exon intoxicated and refused
to name anyone who said they did.
   Tower's behavior ``also discredits Mr. Daub, who made no

   Republican gubernatorial nominee Clayton
Williams called Democrat Ann Richards a ``liar'' to her face during
a campaign appearance and refused to shake hands.
   Appearing together before the Greater Dallas Crime Commission
for an infrequent joint appearance Thursday, Williams walked over
to Richards' side of the stage to greet supporters.
   When Richards extended her hand, Williams declined to shake it,
saying, ``I'm here to call you a liar today.''
   Richards responded, ``I'm sorry Clayton.''
   Williams then added, ``That's what you are. You've lied about
me; you've lied about Mark White and you've lied about Jim Mattox.
I'm going to finish this deal today.'' Richards defeated White and
Mattox in a bitter Democratic primary.
   Williams campaign spokesman Bill Kenyon said the Republican was
upset that Richards was spreading ``unfounded rumors'' by trying to
link Williams with a federal investigation into alleged drug money
laundering.
   Richards had cited a newspaper report which said federal agents
were investigating allegations against a Houston loan broker, Lloyd
G. Williams Jr., who also has done business with ClayDesta National
Bank, the Midland bank owned by the Republican nominee.

<HEAD>GOP Fund-Raising Group Agrees To Stop Promotion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nationwide Republican campaign funding
organization has agreed to withdraw its effort to raise money in
Idaho by offering people a $25 check, says state Attorney General
Jim Jones.
   The Republican Presidential Task Force has agreed to contact the
people and offer them refunds, said Jones.
   Earlier in the day, Idaho Democratic Chairman Conley Ward asked
Jones to investigate whether the fund-raising tactic violates state
consumer protection laws or criminal fraud statutes.
   Letters told the recipients they could cash the $25 checks at
``ABSOLUTELY NO COST TO YOU.''
   In fact, however, cashing the check constituted permission for
the Task Force to automatically withdraw $12.50 per month from the
recipient's bank account until the recipient sent written notice to
stop it, Democrats said.
   Jones said on Sept. 28, he contacted the organization requesting
information on what they were doing, and officials agreed to stop
it, although there was no admission that there was anything wrong.
   Jones said the group informed him they sent 7,000 letters to
Idaho residents. The same letter went out nationwide, raising
protests from Democrats in some states.

<HEAD>Woman Who Fought Phone Company for 17 Years Left Out of Victory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JON MARCUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman bugged about paying toll charges just to
talk to her daughter six miles away has won a 17-year battle to get
the phone company to change its rate structure. But she won't fully
share in the victory.
   Estelle Simon, 70, of rural Sudbury, can call her daughter's
town of Marlboro for free, but Sudbury residents still will be
charged for calling Lincoln, which shares a high school with
Sudbury, because of how the system is wired.
   ``Can you believe this?'' Simon said in an interview this week.
``I blew my top.''
   In fact, there will still be a charge to call the local crisis
line six miles away in Acton.
   ``People who are about to commit suicide are not going to make a
toll call,'' Simon scoffed.
   Simon decided to take on AT&amp;T - then the largest corporation in
the world - in 1973 when her daughter moved a toll call away to
neighboring Marlboro.
   ``I realized there was a lot wrong with the telephone company,''
she said.
   Waging battle singlehandedly in rate hearings and regulatory
proceedings before the state Department of Public Utilities, Simon
argued that small-town residents were subsidizing the phone service
of people in big cities.
   All paid the same $9 for basic service, but big-city dwellers
could reach more phones for free. Until 1984, in fact, customers in
93 communities, including Sudbury, were even charged for calls
within the same town.
   Thanks to Simon, New England Telephone Co. on Oct. 19 will
eliminate toll charges for calls between neighboring exchanges and
reduce rates for other in-state calls. The ruling affects more than
100 exchanges around the state.
   Public Utilities officials had said during the battle that
Simon's case was so well documented that New England Telephone
would probably be forced to overhaul its whole rate structure.
   ``It was very flattering but, at the same time, my heart sank,''
she said. ``Here we were fighting with the phone company to give
relief to 4,200 phones, which is all we had in Sudbury. Now we were
talking about thousands of phones and millions of dollars, and I
knew they were going to fight that much harder.''
   Under the new rates, a four-minute morning call from Brimfield
to Williamstown in western Massachusetts on a weekday will fall
from $1.11 to 23 cents. A four-minute call at the same time of day
from Boston to New York costs 87 cents over AT&amp;T.
   The phone company also eliminated the toll for calling Marlboro.
Simon said she recently paid about $100 a month in calls to her
daughter.
   But basic service went up $3, and dialing Lincoln will continue
to cost extra in Sudbury, about 15 miles from downtown Boston. The
day rate for calls to Lincoln will be 19 cents for the first minute
and 9 cents a minute after that.
   That's because of the wiring configuration between the towns and
billing problems, the phone company said, an argument used against
Simon for 17 years.
   ``There are people who are saying, `Gee, I wish you could have
included this town or that town.' But you can't get the approval of
all of the people all of the time,'' said New England Telephone
spokeswoman Roberta Clement.
   Simon said her battle with the phone company is over.
   ``I see no reason for me to go downtown and tell the whole story
over again,'' she said. ``All they have to do is look at the case.
They know I'm right.''
   Before she stepped out of the ring, however, Simon forced New
England Telephone to stop misleading advertisements that promised
toll-free calls between all bordering communities.
   ``They do these things,'' said Simon. ``But nobody fights
back.''

<HEAD>Radical School Choice Measure on Oregon Ballot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES E. BEGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's education establishment is watching
an Oregon ballot measure that would let parents send their children
to any school in the state.
   The so-called school choice proposal on the Nov. 6 ballot also
would give parents a $2,500 tax credit for sending their children
to private or church schools or teaching them at home.
   Oregon voters face 10 other measures, including two
anti-abortion measures, a strict recycling measure, a proposed
shutdown of the state's only nuclear plant, a seat belt law and a
measure requiring welfare recipients to work.
   The school choice proposal is widely viewed as a watershed for
American education. Vice President Dan Quayle stumped for it last
month, sounding the Bush administration's theme that school choice
is the path to better schools.
   ``It is time to shake up the educational system,'' Quayle said
in Salem. ``We have competition in just about every other section
of our society except for education in the kindergarten through
12th grade.''
   Supporters of school choice say competition for students will
force schools to do a better job or close.
   Foes attack the measure's constitutionality, arguing it would
amount to providing public funds to aid religion.
   Teacher unions and others in the nation's public school
establishment fear that their necks may be on the block if the
measure passes and other states follow.
   A late September poll indicated the measure was trailing,
although polls show strong support for another education
initiative. That measure, defeated five times previously, would
phase in a permanent limit on property tax rates by 1995.
   Among the other Oregon ballot contests:
   -Two anti-abortion proposals, one that would ban abortions
except to save the woman's life or in cases of rape or incest, and
a less drastic measure requiring a doctor to notify a parent when a
minor seeks an abortion.
   Opponents of both measures have raised more than $550,000,
including $89,000 from Planned Parenthood. Supporters reported
spending about $80,000 as of Sept. 27.
   -Strict recycling standards on packaging sold by retailers.
   The American Paper Institute, Dow Chemical Co., Exxon Corp.,
Amoco Chemical Co. and Chevron Corp., among other companies and
business groups, have raised more than $1.4 million to defeat it.
Two committees backing the measure reported raising $293,000,
mostly in small donations.
   -A measure to shut down the Trojan nuclear plant about 40 miles
from Portland until certain conditions are met, including creation
of a federal disposal site for radioactive waste.
   Portland General Electric Co., the owner, has spent $1.2 million
battling the measure. Backers reported raising $45,000. A similar
initiative was defeated in 1986 by 64 percent. Strong support for
this year's version in earlier polls has eroded in a recent survey.
   -An initiative setting up a pilot program of government-financed
jobs with businesses in lieu of welfare, unemployment or food
stamps.
   Most workers would be paid 90 percent of the minimum wage.
Savings from regular government assistance programs would pay the
salaries.
   The initiative was put on the ballot mainly by the efforts of
Jeld-Wen, a Klamath Falls wood products company. Jeld-Wen founder
Dick Wendt calls the project the full employment program.
   Opponents say it actually will penalize laid-off employees who
would earn less than unemployment benefits.
   -A proposal requiring seat belt use. Oregon now requires seat
belt use only for people under 16. Voters in 1988 defeated a
similar measure extending the law to all ages.

<HEAD>Desert Shield Training Flights Resume After Grounding</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Air Force war planes participating in
Operation Desert Shield are flying again after they were ordered
grounded for 24 hours following a rash of crashes.
   Pentagon and Air Force officials said regular training flight
schedules resumed Thursday at noon local time (5 a.m. EDT). The
flights account for a majority of U.S. air missions in the Persian
Gulf region.
   The Air Force ``has not changed anything'' in flight operations
as a result of the suspension of flights, Capt. A.C. Roper, a
spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said in Saudi Arabia.
   He said Air Force officials wanted to ``examine potential
hazards and to be sure they were doing everything possible to
prevent accidents.
   ``They have not identified any common cause or common
contributing factors'' to the recent accidents, he added.
   At the Pentagon, spokesman Pete Williams said the number of U.S.
aircraft accidents in the gulf - including three separate crashes
this week - were not out of the ordinary. However, suspension of
training flights indicated otherwise.
   Williams said the Air Force gave its pilots in the gulf ``safety
awareness'' briefings during the flight ban in order ``to review
what they need to do to fly more safely.''
   Aircraft on operational missions were not grounded, said Col.
Miguel Monteverde, another Pentagon spokesman. Those included
reconnaissance aircraft, refueling tanker planes and F-15 jets
patrolling areas near the Kuwait or Iraqi borders. He said pilots
of those planes received special safety briefings but their flight
schedules were not changed.
   ``So there was no degradation of our ability to defend
ourselves,'' Monteverde said.
   Desert Shield, the largest U.S. military buildup since the
Vietnam War, involves an estimated 700 Air Force combat and support
aircraft.
   Williams said information about the number of flight hours in
Desert Shield is classified and will not be disclosed. As a result,
he said, he could not compare the accident rate with that of
previous deployments.
   The toll for accidental deaths since Operation Desert Shield
began rose to 31 on Wednesday when an Air Force F-111
fighter-bomber crashed on a training mission in Saudi Arabia,
killing both crew members.
   On Monday, two pilots were killed in the crash of an Air Force
F-4 Phantom reconnaissance jet in Saudi Arabia, and just hours
earlier two Marine Corps UH-1 Huey helicopters, each carrying four
crew members, crashed over the Arabian Sea, killing all eight men.
   Williams said the Air Force was the only service that has taken
special measures to review safety in the gulf since this week's
accidents.
   ``They're concerned about the accidents, they're concerned about
the number of accidents that happened so quickly over a short
period of time,'' he told reporters.
   He said, however, that the military's safety record in Desert
Shield remained good.
   ``Given the amount of flying that has to be done, given the
extraordinary circumstances and given the higher than ordinary
operating tempo in the area, I think our service people are doing
very well, but any accident is cause for concern,'' he said.
   Five U.S. aircraft have been involved in fatal crashes in the
gulf area since the start of Desert Shield two months ago: an
F-111, an F-4 Phantom reconnaissance jet, an F-15E and two Marine
Corps UH-1 Huey helicopters. Also, a C-5 transport plane crashed in
West Germany while ferrying equipment to Saudi Arabia.
   Also, 20 other aircraft have been involved in non-fatal
accidents in the gulf area, Williams said. Fifteen of those were
helicopters.

   The Stasi secret police is officially
defunct, but its shadow of fear still darkens the lives of Germans
in their newly unified land.
   A rash of arrests of former East German spies has embarrassed
people who ran West Germany's intelligence network and raised
questions about their effectiveness. But the troubles don't stop
there.
   Criminal justice officials fret over the legal complications of
prosecuting former Stasi workers who will undoubtedly say they were
only following orders, just as Nazi criminals did after World War
II.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl vows Stasi criminals will be prosecuted,
but he warns against letting the Stasi legacy ``poison our nation's
atmosphere.
   ``A suspect must be taken to court if facts warrant it,'' Kohl
said in an interview with the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.
   He added, however, ``We must in no way open up a witch hunt, but
protect our capacity for reconciliation.''
   Lawmakers in former West Germany fear that Parliament, called
the Bundestag, will be tainted by newcomers from East Germany who
may have aided Stasi officers at home.
   ``It is important to clarify that no Stasi accomplices are among
the former Volkskammer (East German Parliament) members now in the
Bundestag, nor that they violated basic human rights,'' said
Burkhard Hirsch, a lawmaker with the Free Democratic Party.
   During its existence, East Germany's Ministry for State Security
was split into two sections: one for foreign espionage and one that
ran a vast, feared network of repression, blackmail, coercion and
surveillance at home.
   It is believed that a number of East Germans with political
ambitions had links to the domestic section.
   Germans are also troubled by Stasi's past links with
international terrorism. The Stasi's former leaders are believed to
have helped some of the world's most notorious terrorists,
including Abu Nidal and ``Carlos the Jackal.''
   News reports say international terrorists may still be lurking
on German soil.
   Revelations about the Stasi's malignant grip appear in German
news media nearly every day, feeding a public preoccupation with
the issue.
   People were shocked by news reports that Stasi agents may have
killed a number of East German dissidents who fled to the West. The
deaths were initially ruled accidents, but some of the cases are
being reopened.
   In the old East Germany, people are incensed after hearing news
reports that some of the same Stasi officers who spied on them now
have jobs in law enforcement.
   ``There are signs that old Stasi networks have survived and are
active in united Germany,'' Dankward Brinksmeier, former chairman
of an East German parliamentary committee that investigated the
secret police, told the news magazine Der Spiegel.
   When the occasional individual has admitted to former ties to
Stasi, he has been turned into a pariah.
   One East German politician, Werner Meyer-Bodemann, says he
received death threats after confessing last month that he was
coerced into working as an informer for the Stasi. His political
future is suddenly in doubt.
   A number of lawmakers from former West Germany want to create a
special committee and empower it to look at Stasi files that would
shed light on the pasts of Bundestag newcomers.
   But many former East Germans say not even the federal government
should have the right to look at the Stasi files because they
contain secrets obtained by spying on East Germans.
   The files also worry many former West Germans.
   The Stasi's 90,000 official employees and a force of perhaps
more than 180,000 informers did not limit their snooping to East
Germans.
   Visiting West German leaders, lawmakers, businessmen and
tourists were the targets of Stasi workers.
   Germans are uncertain which former Stasi leaders they should
prosecute.
   The long-time head of the Ministry for State Security, Erich
Mielke, is under arrest on suspicion of helping members of the
outlawed Red Army Faction terrorist gang, among other charges.
   Spies who gave away Western secrets to the East also face
charges.
   The government plans an amnesty for East German spies who
committed lesser offenses, but there's disagreement over who
exactly should be covered.
   There's also uncertainty over who will be jailed from among the
domestic secret police, who were responsible for everything from
eavesdropping to beating up dissidents.
   Justice Ministry spokesman Juergen Schmid said former security
officers who killed or injured other East Germans will be
prosecuted. That includes border guards who killed about 180 East
Germans who tried to flee to the West.
   But he said courts could face some daunting difficulties if
suspects contend they were innocent because they were only
following orders. The problem, he said, is that ``you have to
decide to what extent someone can be blamed for carrying out the
will of a politically repressive regime.''

<TEXT>
   The MacArthur Foundation has pledged $40 million
over the next decade to help Chicago schools - once called the
worst in the nation - continue on their path to reform.
   Grants will be awarded to community organizations, individual
schools and the school system itself, foundation president Adele
Simmons said Thursday.
   The foundation, one of the nation's largest philanthropies,
hopes to encourage communities to develop their own solutions to
education problems, Simmons said in a statement.
   ``We do not believe that any single educational approach will
work for every school and neighborhood,'' she said.
   The grant was announced on the one-year anniversary of the
election of local councils to run Chicago's schools in a radical
decentralization program.
   The 545 schools elected councils composed of six parents, two
teachers and two community residents without schoolchildren.
   The councils were given broad powers, including authority to
hire and fire principals and balance budgets. A few councils
implemented sweeping changes, including year-round classes and
school uniforms.
   In 1987, then-Education Secretary William Bennett called
Chicago's schools the worst in the nation.

   A man torched an apartment complex with a
flare gun after an argument over an $8 debt, killing a 15-month-ol
girl, critically burning her parents and injuring seven others,
police said.
   Rescue crews made their way through the rubble today in search
of two teen-agers unaccounted for. Forty-eight people escaped
unharmed.
   Bruce Wayne Campbell, a former tenant of the two-story, 24-unit
La Villita complex, was jailed on $75,000 bail on charges of arson,
police said.
   The fire apparently was started about 2 a.m. Thursday with a
flare gun belonging to Campbell, a friend of a former manager of
the gutted complex, police said.
   Two people, including a pregnant woman, jumped from a
second-floor window to escape the fire, said Sally Muir,
spokeswoman for the city Emergency Medical Service. The two were
hospitalized, one in fair condition, the other in serious.
   One man said he threw rocks at windows to wake people up.
   Campbell, 30, was seen arguing with tenants over $8 he was owed,
said homicide Detective Michael Huckabay. The fire began in a
vacant apartment where Campbell once lived, police said.
   The body of a 15-month-old girl was found in the rubble. Her
parents, Emmett Jackson, 34, and Diathia Reeder, 35, were listed in
critical condition, authorities said.
   Five other people were either treated at hospitals and released
or treated at the scene.
   Fire officials did not know whether the complex had fire and
smoke alarms.

   Marchers at Haram es-Sharif carried a symbolic
coffin draped with an outlawed Palestinian flag. Jews, who call the
site Temple Mount, swayed in prayer at the Western Wall nearby.
   Again, the site revered by three religions is at the vortex of a
political firestorm.
   Tens of thousands of Jews heeded the Israeli government call
Thursday to come to the Western Wall, also known as the Wailing
Wall, to dance at the end of the Sukkot holiday and to support
Israel's control of the holy site.
   The area held holy by Jews, Christians and Moslems played host
Thursday to political demonstrations after Monday's riot in which
19 Palestinians died from police gunfire.
   At the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, built where Christ is
believed to have been buried, Palestinians mounted a sit-down
strike.
   Women in traditional Palestinian black dresses decorated with
embroidery sat in the courtyard of the church, while other
Palestinians sat inside the white stone building.
   Earlier this year, the church was a focal point of Palestinian
demonstrations over efforts by Jewish settlers to occupy a nearby
hostel in the Christian Quarter.
   On Monday, the violence took place when Arabs at Haram es-Sharif
began throwing stones down on Jews praying directly below at the
Western Wall.
   Israeli police moved in tear gas, rubber bullets and live
ammunition. By the time it was over, about 140 Arabs and 30 Jews
were injured, in addition to the 19 Palestinians killed.
   On Thursday, Arab Christian clergymen walked from the 11th
Century church to Haram es-Sharif, which is Arabic for ``noble
enclosure.'' The clerics, who included Greek Catholic Patriarch
Lutfi Laham and Anglican Bishop Samir Kafity, went for small cups
of unsweetened Arabic coffee. They drank with Moslems in a
traditional gesture of mourning.
   ``We came here to share with our brother Moslems their great
grief, and we pray to God to grant this land peace and to preserve
this Islamic shrine,'' said Bishop Basilus of the Coptic Church.
   The site generally draws its largest crowds for Moslem Friday
prayers, and mosque preachers do not miss the opportunity to
comment to the large audience on current events, whether the
Persian Gulf crisis or the Israeli occupation.
   The reverence for the site by both Jews and Moslems was at the
heart of the rioting that enveloped the area Monday.
   As Jews held their daily prayers at the Western Wall for the
eight-day harvest festival of Sukkot, a rumor spread on the Temple
Mount above that a group of Jewish zealots planned to march there.
   The group, called the Temple Mount Faithful, wants to build the
so-called Third Temple on the site of the Jews' two ancient
temples, the last destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D.
   However, the site is now occupied by two 7th and 8th Century
mosques - Al Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock. Moslems believe it to
be the spot where the Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven.
   The site is the holiest in Islam outside Saudi Arabia. The
Western Wall, the remnant of the last ancient Jewish temple, is the
most revered site to Jews.
   Both are in Jerusalem's Old City, which Israel captured from
Jordan along with the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel
later annexed the area.
   As the Christian clergymen visited the Mount on Thursday,
hundreds of Moslems marched for hours around the Dome of the Rock
carrying a coffin covered by a black, white, green and red
Palestinian flag.
   The chanted ``Allahu Akbar!'' - God is great - and ``We will
redeem the martyrs!''
   At the Wailing Wall, Jews were preparing for the festival of
Simchat Torah, or ``Joy of the Torah,'' which ends the eight days
of Sukkot. Jews celebrate the end of the Sukkot festival by dancing
with biblical scrolls.
   Many carried guns. Hundred of riot police stood guard.

   Officials of the company that makes ``Little
People'' toys say they're puzzled that New York's attorney general
has continued to attack the miniature figures as choking hazards to
children.
   Carol Blackley, a spokeswoman for Fisher-Price, said Thursday
she had thought the matter was closed after the company agreed in
June to toughen its warning labels and pay $25,000 to New York
state.
   But Attorney General Robert Abrams sent a letter Thursday to
Consumer Product Safety Commission chairwoman Jacqueline
Jones-Smith asking her to alert parents to the potential choking
hazards of Little People. He also asked that CPSC increase the size
of its small-parts standard for toys.
   ``While the commission continues to do no more than `review' the
toy, children continue to die,'' Abrams wrote, citing the recent
deaths of two 6-month-old boys who choked on Little People.
   But Blackley said the Little People package clearly states the
toys are intended for children ages 2 to 6 and pose a choking
hazard to any child who puts the things in his mouth.
   Fisher-Price, a division of Quaker Oats Co. in Chicago, has been
making Little People for more than 30 years. In that time, five
children are known to have choked to death on the figures, Blackley
said. All but one of those children were below the recommended age
range for the toy, she said.

<TEXT>
   Briggs &amp; Stratton, one of the nation's leading
manufacturers of lawn mower engines, is recalling 850,000 fuel
tanks sold since July 1, 1989, because they may leak gasoline.
   The engines, installed on more than 100 brands of walk-behind
mowers, have the name ``Quantum Power'' on top, said the Consumer
Product Safety Commission.
   Sears, Snapper and Toro produced some mowers using those engines
without the name. CPSC said owners of those machines, purchased
after July 1, 1989, should check the engine model number on a plate
just above the spark plug.
   If the first two digits are 12, the fuel tank is subject to
recall.
   If a tank leaks, the CPSC said, the owner should arrange for a
replacement at 16,000 Briggs &amp; Stratton dealers at no charge. If it
is not leaking, owners are advised to make an appointment for a
replacement.

   President Bush will visit Mexico next month
and five South American countries in December, the White House
announced.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Thursday that the
president will visit Monterrey, Mexico, on Nov. 26-27 at the
invitation of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   During the second trip, scheduled for Dec. 2-8, Bush will travel
to Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and Venezuela. It will be his
second trip journey to South America as president.
   The president has scheduled an Oct. 27 meeting in Honolulu with
leaders of 13 Pacific island states of Micronesia, Melanesia and
Polynesia. The session with the Pacific island leaders will take
place during a five-day political campaign swing that will also
take Bush to New Mexico, Arizona, California and Oklahoma.
   The five-nation South American trip originally had been planned
for mid-September, but was postponed because of the Persian Gulf
crisis and domestic budget problems.
   Bush went to Colombia for a one-day drug summit with Latin

<HEAD>Lawmakers Compromise on Cable Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two lawmakers blocking Senate action on a
bill to re-regulate cable television have agreed to a compromise
under which cable companies could continue programming deals that
freeze out satellite dish owners.
   Sens. Al Gore, D-Tenn., and Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., reached the
accord after the bill's manager, Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, last
month declared it ``dead and buried'' for the year because of
threats of a filibuster by Wirth and a veto by President Bush.
   Bush has not backed off his veto threat, but Gore and Wirth
agreed Thursday on ``exclusivity'' contracts that would require the
Federal Communications Commission to determine their use illegal if
abused.
   Gore, who favored better access by satellite dish owners and
other cable competitors like so-called ``wireless cable'' operators
to the programming produced by the cable industry, said he hoped
the bill could be brought to the Senate floor early next week.
   ``To those who would continue to block its consideration on
behalf of the cable industry or the White House, I would only say
that such a move would backfire,'' he said, threatening to
introduce a tougher bill on the industry next year.
   Both the Senate bill and a similar measure passed by the House
last month would require cable operators to provide a ``basic
tier'' of cable service - local and public TV stations plus
government-access channels - at rates regulated by the FCC.
   The legislation is a response to a growing wave of consumer
complaints about excessive rates and poor service in many areas
after the industry was deregulated by Congress in 1986.

<HEAD>Thrusters Fire on Ulysses as NASA Prepares Shuttle for Trip to

<TEXT>
   The Ulysses solar explorer fired its
thrusters and zoomed farther from Earth, while the shuttle that
launched the spacecraft was readied for next week's piggyback jet
ride home to Florida.
   NASA, meanwhile, formed a team to investigate why the shuttle
Discovery lifted off Saturday with incorrect instructions for how
it should operate some of its computer programs.
   Ulysses' two-day series of thruster firings were to end this
afternoon. The maneuver was designed to turn Ulysses so its main
antenna dish pointed toward Earth, allowing faster communication
with controllers.
   The $250 million spacecraft, which will explore the sun's polar
regions in 1994-95, is the centerpiece of a $750 million joint
mission by NASA and the European Space Agency.
   Since it was launched from Discovery on Saturday, Ulysses has
been communicating with its controllers through one of its smaller
antennas.
   Discovery landed Wednesday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
Maintenance crews found Discovery in excellent condition after its
1.7-million-mile, four-day flight, said shuttle processing manager
Tip Talone.
   He said only 10 to 15 of Discovery's heat-shield tiles need to
be replaced. Debris that hit the shuttle during its launch and
landing caused 13 ``dings'' larger than one inch, and about 50
smaller ones.
   ``That's a very low number,'' Talone said. ``Every time we come
back, we seem to learn more about how to fly and land the thing
without taking a lot of hits.''
   Talone said Discovery should be ready for a one-day flight back
to its Cape Canaveral, Fla., launch site on Monday, riding
piggyback on a modified jumbo jet.
   Shuttle project engineer Chris Fairey said Thursday that the
incorrect instructions were loaded into one of Discovery's
computers Oct. 4.
   The investigators will recommend steps to prevent such an error
from happening again, he added.
   The incorrect instructions were noticed and fixed by Discovery's
five astronauts about an hour after the shuttle was launched.
   They never posed a danger to the shuttle or its crew - even if
the error hadn't been detected, said Milt Heflin, lead flight
director at Johnson Space Center in Houston.
   Heflin said NASA considered the problem serious because it went
undetected before Discovery was launched. Fairey called it ``really
minor'' but said it ``did point out a minor deficiency in the way
we code our software.''
   Ulysses was 3.68 million miles from Earth on Thursday, zipping
toward a 1992 flight past Jupiter at 25,372 mph, said Franklin
O'Donnell, a spokesman at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Ulysses
will use Jupiter's gravity to sling it into orbit around the sun.

   It's bad enough that Anatoly Karpov had to
settle for a draw in his first game against world chess champion
Garry Kasparov. Now comes the news - from a computer, no less -
that he could have won, easily.
   Chess-playing machine Deep Thought offered an electronic
second-guess Thursday, asserting Karpov could have brought Kasparov
to his knees with a pawn move.
   The pair instead battled to a draw in the first game. Kasparov
came back to win the second game of the best-of-24-game World Chess
Championship. The $1 million match was to continue today.
   ``Sometimes a machine can see things a human misses,'' said
Murray Campbell, one of Deep Thought's developers who works for
IBM. ``There would have been a very good chance for Karpov to win,
although it's not guaranteed.''
   Word of the Deep Thought second-guess filtered in to both
players, Campbell said. The word back to Campbell and co-developer
Feng-Hsiung Hsu was that Kasparov was already aware of his gaffe,
while Karpov was not.
   USA Today reported that Karpov subsequently acknowledged the
supercomputer was right. Karpov's manager was not available for
comment Thursday on Deep Thought's thoughts.
   The computer can consider 1 million moves in a second.
   Campbell and Hsu were two of five graduate students who
developed the chess-playing computer at Carnegie Mellon University
in Pittsburgh. Deep Thought went on to become the first computer to
defeat a chess grandmaster.
   Kasparov and Karpov have defeated Deep Thought in head-to-head
competition.
   Campbell acknowledged his computer would be overmatched if the
champion performed the way he did in game two Wednesday against
Karpov.
   ``Kasparov played very well, better than the machine can play at
this point,'' he said.

<HEAD>Authorities Say Hunters Paid to Kill Captive Bears, Cougars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BENNINGTON, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hunters paid up to $4,000 to kill bears
and cougars raised in captivity during shooting sprees at a game
preserve, authorities say.
   ``This wasn't hunting. It was target practice,'' said Herb Hill,
the range manager who reported the hunts.
   More than two dozen agents raided the 160-acre Texoma Hunting
Wilderness on Wednesday.
   ``Dealing with animals, this is the worst thing I've ever dealt
with,'' Sam Cottrell, a state game ranger for 24 years, said
Thursday. ``You can't even call it a hunt.''
   Agents were to meet today to decide whether to take action
against those involved in the alleged hunts.
   The hunting range bought grizzly bears, black bears, cougars and
elk from zoos, preserves and at auctions, Cottrell said. Hunters
paid $1,000 to $4,000 to hunt the animals, he said.
   Grizzly bears are protected under federal law as an endangered
species, and the black bear, cougar and elk are protected under
state law.
   Hill said hunters stalked the animals in a fenced area the size
of a football field.
   ``Of course, here are animals - big cats, bears, what have you -
that have been raised in captivity, fed every day and watered,''
Hill said. ``It was like shooting fish in a barrel.''
   Hill said at least 300 people paid to shoot the animals. He said
he notified state agents about the operation two years ago and
stayed on in hopes of getting it changed or closed.
   Authorities said the range operated for nearly five years.
Officials said the hunting range is owned by Charles B. Bartholomew
of Norman.
   The investigation was conducted by the state Department of
Wildlife and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
   ``We found one receipt for a grizzly bear that was killed,''
Cottrell said. ``They had eight live mountain lions, three (live)
black bears, and several elk and deer in deep freezes for taxidermy
work.''

<TEXT>
   With the November election less than four weeks
away, Americans are dissatisfied with Congress in general but more
favorably disposed toward their own representatives, according to a
New York Times-CBS News poll.
   Sixty percent of those polled said they disapprove of the way
Congress is doing its job, with 27 percent saying they approve, the
Times reported today.
   The approval rating was down sharply from January, when 42
percent said they approved of Congress' job performance.
   Asked whether most members of Congress ``are more interested in
serving the people they represent, or more interested in serving
special interest groups,'' 71 percent said special interest groups
and 20 percent said the people.
   The respondents appeared to be less critical of their own
representatives than of the rest of Congress.
   Forty-four percent said their representative deserves
re-election, while 40 percent say they would prefer somebody new.
   Asked about Congress in general, 67 percent said it is time ``to
give new people a chance,'' and 20 percent said most members
deserve re-election.
   The results are based on a telephone survey of 960 adults
between Monday and Wednesday. The poll has a margin of error of
plus or minus three percentage points.

   Anatole Broyard, a literary critic and former
editor of The New York Times Book Review, has died. He was 70.
   Broyard, who lived in Cambridge, Mass., and died of prostate
cancer Thursday at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, was
a daily book critic for nearly 15 years before serving three years
as an editor of the book review.
   After retiring in 1989, he continued to write a monthly essay,
``About Books,'' in the book review, and compiled for the book
review a weekly, unsigned column of excerpts from books, ``Noted
With Pleasure.''
   Broyard was born in New Orleans. He studied at Brooklyn College
and the New School For Social Research.
   He wrote two books, ``Aroused by Books'' and ``Men, Women and
Other Anticlimaxes.''
   He taught creative writing at Columbia University, the New
School for Social Research and New York University.
   Survivors include his wife, Alexandra, a son, a daughter and two
sisters.
   Funeral arrangements were not immediately known.

<HEAD>`20-20' Producer Resigns Over Bogus Buckwheat Interview</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A producer responsible for an interview with
a Buckwheat impostor on ABC's ``20-20'' has resigned, the network
says.
   Lynn Murray resigned in a ``mutual decision'' with ABC after
last week's segment ``Whatever Happened to `Our Gang?''' said
``20-20'' spokeswoman Maurie Perl.
   The news magazine aired an interview with a man who claimed he
played Buckwheat in the ``Our Gang'' comedies of the 1930s and '40s
and was now working as a grocery bagger in Tempe, Ariz.
   William Thomas, who actually portrayed Buckwheat, died in 1980.
   Victor Neufeld, the program's executive producer, decided Murray
did not properly handle research for the segment, Perl said
Thursday. Murray had worked with ``20-20'' in several capacities
for 10 years, Perl said.
   ``20-20'' anchorman Hugh Downs will apologize during tonight's
broadcast ``for any pain and discomfort'' the error might have
caused Thomas' family, Perl said.
   Thomas' son, William Thomas Jr., and George McFarland, who
played Spanky in the ``Our Gang'' comedies, challenged last week's
broadcast. ABC later acknowledged the bogus Buckwheat, Bill
English, had pulled a hoax.
   English had told ``20-20'' during the interview that he had
changed his name so he could work at the supermarket without being
recognized.
   Perl said the interview was suggested by a viewer and that
English apparently has told people for the past 30 years that he
played Buckwheat.
   The ``Our Gang'' episodes were renamed ``The Little Rascals''
for television.

<TEXT>
   A judge has refused the Roman Catholic Church's
request to shut down a play it considers blasphemous in a building
it owns.
   ``I'm not a censor and I'm not going to engage in any act of
censorship,'' state Supreme Court Justice Irma Vidal Santaella said
Thursday in refusing to stop performances of the RAPP theater
company's ``The Cardinal Detoxes.''
   The play, by Thomas Disch, is a 35-minute monologue delivered by
a cardinal who has fatally struck a pregnant woman while driving
drunk.
   Santaella ruled last week that the church had a right to start
eviction proceedings against RAPP, which was staging the play in a
former parochial school.
   The judge found that RAPP had violated the part of its lease
that allow the landlord - the church - to determine what
activities by the theater group are ``detrimental to the
reputation'' of the landlord.
   But the judge said RAPP had a First Amendment right to perform
the play in the meantime.
   The activist lawyer William Kunstler, representing RAPP, said
the church was bringing the case ``in the wrong country and in the
wrong century.''
   In the play, the cardinal calls the church a sham and tries to
blackmail other Catholic officials into getting him off the hook by
bribing a judge. After he threatens to expose the church's problems
if they don't help him, a monk gives him poisoned wine.
   The church's lawyer, Frank McLaughlin, said, ``The church has
been injured, your honor, injured by the blasphemy in the play,
injured by the mockery.''

<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S.-led military buildup in
Saudi Arabia has local businessmen scrambling for contracts to sell
everything from tomatoes to tents.
   ``The economy here is really, really percolating,'' said Gene
Heck, commercial attache at the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh.
   Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait has thrown most regional
economies into disarray, causing big cash flights and paralyzing
stock markets.
   However, in Saudi Arabia, the military deployment countering
Iraq has opened a rich field for entrepreneurs.
   Most are in the kingdom already. Others from the United States
and around the world hope to use the military presence to enter the
Saudi market for the first time.
   Heck's job is to help businesses channel their ideas to
decision-makers in the military.
   ``One of the messages we need to get across is that this is just
as stable an economy as it was before Aug. 2,'' he said. ``The
opportunities are even greater.''
   Heck peers over thick glasses at a stack of yellow message slips
and rattles off the names of companies who want to do business in
Saudi Arabia. He estimates 15-20 firms contact him every day.
   ``There's a company in Indianopolis that wants to sell mobile
field kitchens that prepare 15,000 meals in 24 hours,'' he said.
``They've got retired generals on their board - that usually
helps.''
   Other business propositions are not quite so well thought out.
``I've got a guy in Jiddah who has 7,000 videotapes that the (Saudi
police) won't let him sell, so he wants to sell them to the
troops,'' said Heck.
   Press reports say the foreign military presence in the kingdom
is likely to generate about $5 billion in sales from the private
sector directly to the military. Everyone seems to want a piece of
the action.
   Omanis want to sell spices to the troops. Thais are hawking
fruit juice, and the Dutch and Danish have dairy products. They're
all calling Heck, who carries a foot-high stack of catalogues to
military procurement people two or three times a week.
   Col. John Downey, chief of the military contracting office in
Riyadh, said he answers 10 to 15 calls a day. He gives callers the
numbers of procurement officers in Army, Navy, Air Force, and
Marines. All do separate purchasing.
   ``There are awful lot of people running around looking for
opportunities,'' said Keith Poulin, president of Dalil
International Development Corp., a business development firm.
   ``I deal with a large agriculture development company, and the
guy there starts talking to me about gas masks. I said `What's this
got to do with lettuce and tomatoes?' People jump into new
businesses whenever they see an opportunity.''
   Poulin said gas masks top the list of items companies are trying
to sell to the military.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has vowed to use chemical weapons
if his country is attacked.
   Poulin also noted that his company received many calls from
Saudis willing to sponsor companies who want to do business with
the military. Under Saudi commercial law, all foreign companies
must have a local sponsor.
   ``We've had a lot of calls from Saudi firms wanting to identify
Canadian sources of goods that are obviously going to be sold to
the military,'' said Ron Bollman, Canadian commercial counselor.
``Most of our exporters are looking at protective clothing,
electronics and telecommunications.''
   Some businessmen, however, feel that there is a dearth of
information on the military procurement process. Leo Kelleher,
manager of projects for Economic Bureau, a 100 percent Saudi-owned
consulting firm, said his company has submitted three proposals to
the military three weeks ago ``and we've been going in circles
every since.''
   Downey conceded that unsolicited proposals to the military may
await four to six weeks for a response. ``It's a lengthy process to
get it through the loop,'' he said. ``We may not have all the
expertise to evaluate it here.''

   Gov. George Deukmejian ordered a ``gay
flag'' removed from the state Capitol, saying the banner had been
mistakenly hoisted.
   The rainbow-colored banner with Greek symbols flew next to the
Stars and Stripes and California state flag for about three hours
Thursday.
   ``Flags are not to be flown over the Capitol that represent any
kind of special-interest group, lifestyle or issue,'' said Susan
Trowbridge, the governor's spokeswoman.
   The Legislature's Joint Rules Committee staff, which governs
housekeeping and maintenance in the Capitol, had approved the flag
to mark a national ``coming out'' day for homosexuals on Thursday.
   Assemblyman Terry Friedman, a Democrat, said the Republican
governor's decision showed his ``long-standing dislike for gay men
and women.''
   Flags commemorating Earth Day, prisoners of war, Black History
Week and other causes have routinely flown over the Capitol, said
Bob Forsyth, a spokesman for David Roberti, Democratic leader of
the state Senate.

<HEAD>Most of Nation's 1990 Blood Pressure Goals Met, CDC Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans failed to achieve at least one
important goal in a 10-year drive by the government to reduce high
blood pressure: losing weight.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that
at least seven of the nine health objectives related to high blood
pressure were met, including a nationwide reduction in the
prevalence of hypertension.
   The goal set a decade ago was for at least 60 percent of the
population with high blood pressure to have it under control; a
recent survey suggests a level of 65 percent, the CDC said.
   But one important goal was missed: reducing the overweight
population to fewer than 10 percent of American men and fewer than
17 percent of women. A 1988 federal survey found 27 percent of men
and 26 percent of women were overweight - defined as more than 20
percent above their desired weight.
   Being overweight increases the risk of high blood pressure,
which is a cause of heart disease and stroke.
   ``Improvements in blood pressure control ... have contributed to
a 50 percent decrease in stroke and a 35 percent decrease in
coronary heart disease since 1972,'' the CDC said.
   But there is work to be done, the agency said: ``Despite this
progress, 30 million persons in the United States still have
inadequately controlled blood pressure.''
   In 1979, when the Health and Human Services Department prepared
its 1990 health goals, high blood pressure was defined as a reading
of 160-95 or higher.
   The CDC objective was to have at least 60 percent of those with
hypertension in control of their blod pressure, and that goal has
most likely been met, the agency said. High blood pressure is
usually controlled with medication.
   Comprehensive studies are not yet complete, the CDC said.
   In 1984, U.S. health officials revised their standard for high
blood pressure to a reading of 140-90, and progress toward that
measurement is less certain.
   Other 1990 blood-pressure goals that have been met, according to
the CDC, include:
   -More than half of U.S. adults should know the principal risk
factors for heart disease and stroke: high blood pressure, smoking,
high cholesterol and diabetes.
   -More than 90 percent of adults should be able to say whether
they have high blood pressure.
   -At least half of processed food in grocery stores should be
labeled with sodium and caloric content.
   Progress isn't known toward one of the goals: reducing the
average daily salt intake to less than 6 grams. No studies have
been done to provide such data, the CDC said.

   Gunfire today killed Egypt's parliament
speaker and two other people outside a downtown Cairo hotel, police
said.
   A police lieutenant said Rifaat el-Mahgoub, 64, speaker of the
People's Assembly, and two security men were slain. The officer
refused to be quoted by name.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility and further
details on the number of attackers or other casualties were
unavailable.
   The shooting came after the interior minister warned of possible
terrorist reprisals for Egypt's stand against Iraq in the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   The incident occurred near the Nile River a block from the U.S.
Embassy. Its doors were sealed immediately, and an embassy diplomat
had to enter through a nearby garage.
   An hour after the shooting, a black Mercedes sat outside the
Semiramis, its rear window and right front window smashed. A dead
body lay in the front seat, the head torn apart by gunfire.
   A blue Peugeot was stopped about 200 yards away, a man's body
hanging onto the roadway from the rear seat. It was unclear whether
that car was involved in the shooting or was passing when the
gunfire occurred.
   All streets were blocked around the 28-story hotel, one of the
newest and poshest in Cairo. Police at the scene said little, but a
bystander who said he saw the attack reported that an unknown
number of assailants fled on motorbikes.
   At the Interior Ministry, responsible for Egypt's domestic
security, Col. Sayed Rashad said he knew nothing more than that a
black Mercedes had been attacked.
   He said Interior Minister Abdel-Halim Moussa was at the scene.
   Moussa, whose ministry handles internal security, said Thursday
that Arabs angered over President Hosni Mubarak's anti-Iraq
position were threatening Egypt with sabotage and assassination.
   The shooting came as early results showed Egyptians
participating in a national referendum Thursday overwhelmingly
voted to give Mubarak a mandate to dissolve Parliament.
   Under the constitution, the affirmative vote will allow Mubarak
to disband the assembly, declared illegal by the constitutional
court, and call new elections within two months.

   A mistrial was declared for a defendant in the
Bensonhurst racial slaying after a juror screamed at the victim's
father, accusing him of staring at her.
   The courtroom outburst Thursday by Lydia Bermudez came on the
second day of deliberations in the case against Charles Stressler.
   ``What are you looking at?'' Ms. Bermudez yelled at Moses
Stewart, the father of slaying victim Yusuf Hawkins. ``You've been
doing that to me every day. You know what I'm talking about. You've
been doing it every ... day.''
   Ms. Bermudez was dismissed. Justice Thaddeus Owens, who had
already sent the alternate jurors home, decided deliberations could
not continue without 12 jurors, and he declared a mistrial.
   Stressler, 22, is accused of murder and other crimes in the 1989
slaying of Hawkins, a 16-year-old black shot through the chest when
he and three friends crossed paths with a mob of whites in
Brooklyn's Bensonhurst section.
   Stressler will go on trial again Jan. 17. Of those charged in
the attack, one has been convicted of murder and two of lesser
charges. Four still face murder trials.
   With the jurors watching Thursday, Stewart stood up and walked
toward the door, mumbling angrily: ``If she can't stand the father
of the victim looking at her, get her ... out of here. I look at
everybody on the jury. I don't care who she is.''
   Ms. Bermudez told the judge that she felt intimidated by
Stewart. ``I don't need this aggravation from this freaking
low-life,'' she said.

   Belgium and Germany today announced they
have pulled all their diplomats from Kuwait as Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein starves out the last envoys from encircled missions
in the conquered emirate.
   The campaign is a key part of his effort to turn Kuwait into the
19th province of Iraq.
   In Bonn, Germany, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said the last
diplomats in the German embassy drove from Kuwait to Baghdad on
Thursday. ZDF television, a German station, said the group included
the ambassador and his wife, along with three embassy staff
members.
   The Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the embassy was vacated because of exhausted food
supplies.
   In their announcement in Brussels, Belgian officials said their
remaining two diplomats had also left for Baghdad on Thursday.
   The Dutch, Italian and Polish embassies, among the compounds
besieged exactly seven weeks ago today, have also withdrawn the
last of their diplomats from Kuwait City in the past week.
   That leaves the Americans, British, Canadians and French as the
only holdouts among Western missions. Few other nations appear to
be staffing their embassies with diplomats.
   The remaining diplomats were surviving mainly on canned food and
occasional loaves of bread carried in by local staff. But they were
surrounded by Iraqi troops enforcing a blockade of supplies. In
most cases, water and electricity have been cut off.
   The holdouts are not expected to last long.
   The ambassadorial standoff reflects the international
confrontation of the Persian Gulf in microcosm. Saddam's forces
have been locked in a war of nerves and attrition with
representatives of many of the countries that have sent troops and
equipment to counter the Iraqi president.
   After Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and annexed the neighboring
oil emirate, it ordered all embassies in the emirate to shut down
by Aug. 24 and began surrounding holdouts that day.
   Iraqi authorities said foreign countries would be represented in
Baghdad, Iraq's capital. The embassy staffs in Kuwait would lose
their diplomatic status and privileges.
   Initially, dozens of embassies balked, refusing to recognize
Iraq's annexation of Kuwait and desperate to help their stranded
nationals. However, as the Iraqi siege set in, the remaining
diplomats have trickled out.
   They have said the departures are temporary, and some of them
have annnounced that the embassies remain technically open. But
it's only a technicality.
   At the U.S. Embassy, 10 diplomats - and an unknown number of
American citizens who took refuge - are eking out a living from
canned goods and perishables stored there before Iraqi tanks rolled
into Kuwait City.
   Life at the embassy is ``kind of hot, stuffy and boring,'' a
U.S. official in Washington said Wednesday. U.S. diplomats ``are
still there because we don't recognize the annexation, we will not
recognize an order based on annexation, and we want to help
American citizens.''
   About 600 Americans are stuck in Kuwait, many in hiding and
several reported to be desperately ill.
   Living conditions at the U.S. embassy are wretched. Power and
water have been severed for more than a month, forcing the
Americans to forgo baths and boil water from the swimming pool to
drink.
   Ambassador W. Nathaniel Howell, deputy ambassador Barbara Bodine
and the other Americans are using outside latrines.
   They sometimes sleep outdoors at night to keep cool, despite
swarms of mosquitoes.
   Telephone conversations are deliberately brief, under the
assumption that the Iraqis have tapped phone lines seeking
information on the whereabouts of Americans or Kuwaitis who are
harboring them.
   At the British Embassy, the two remaining diplomats are eating
cans of tuna and wieners, as well as vegetables from an embassy
garden. They are also brewing their own beer, according to two
other embassy staffers sent to Baghdad to stretch out the dwindling
supplies in Kuwait for the two remaining.
   ``Conditions are becoming harsh,'' French Foreign Ministry
spokesman Daniel Bernard said Monday. But Charge d'Affaires
Jean-Pierre Galtier and his remaining staff ``will stay firmly at
their post,'' he said.
   Life has been no picnic even for those who leave. Iraqi
authorities have allowed them to travel to Baghdad but forced them
to remain.

   Following this nation's latest revolt
last week in the south, a series of political battles has broken
out which dramatize the divisions undermining President Corazon
Aquino's government.
   The disputes serve as an example of the political infighting
which has hampered the administration's effectiveness in dealing
with the nation's problems and reduced public faith in government.
   The seventh military rebellion against Mrs. Aquino ended last
Saturday when renegade Col. Alexander Noble surrendered after
seizing two military garrisons and proclaiming independence for the
second largest island, Mindanao.
   Military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa said after the
mutiny that the key to ending the threat of coups was ``better
government . . . united to move as one.''
   Recent events show little sign of such unity.
   Noble surrendered to Sen. Aquilino Pimentel, one of the senior
military and civilian officials who rushed to Cagayan de Oro on
Mindanao to confront the rebellion.
   No sooner had he returned to Manila than Pimentel accused the
senior Cabinet member on the scene, Local Government Secretary Luis
Santos, of drinking heavily in Cagayan de Oro instead of helping
solve the crisis.
   Several newspapers also reported hat Santos and his entourage
nearly provoked a shootout among government forces by staging a
publicity stunt - hauling down an independent Mindanao flag from
the camp flagpole and hoisting the Philippine flag.
   Col. Plaridel Obrique, deputy commander of the 4th Infantry
Division, protested that Santos and others from Manila were trying
to get the glory for ``recapturing'' the camp when in fact Noble
gave up without a fight.
   The flag-raising idea, reportedly planned for the benefit of
photographers, was scrapped after Obrique's troops threatened
violence, the papers said.
   Santos spokesman Antonio Ortiz said Wednesday that Santos ``has
no time to answer'' allegations against him.
   Mrs. Aquino asked for an explanation of the charges but none was
offered.
   Her own spokesman, Tomas Gomez, meanwhile provoked a war of
words with Vice President Salvador Laurel by claiming that Laurel
supporters signed a $900,000 contract with a U.S. public relations
firm to smear the Aquino administration in the United States.
   ``Where did the money come from?'' Gomez asked. ``Did it come
from Imelda (Marcos)? Did it come from ultrarightists who belong to
the Republican government (in Washington)? Or did it come from
ex-CIA sources?''
   Laurel broke with Mrs. Aquino in 1987 and resigned as foreign
secretary although he kept his elected post as vice president. Mrs.
Aquino has frequently accused Laurel of failing to stand up for
democracy in times of crisis.
   Laurel's office denied the smear campaign allegation and
countered by releasing the names of 16 American public relations
firms hired by the Aquino administration.
   ``Now that Gomez has opened this can of worms, he should detail
to the public how many precious dollars have been spent while the
country grovels under heavy external debt and piecemeal
existence,'' Laurel spokesman Ike Gutierrez said.
   Gomez said the 16 firms were hired to lobby for greater
purchases of Philippine coconut and sugar products.

<HEAD>Animal Shelter Pays $425,000 in Fatal Attack by `Pet of the Week'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WALTON BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sharon Carpenter says a $425,000
settlement from an animal shelter has not erased the memory of
seeing her 4-year-old son fatally mauled by a wolf-dog hybrid.
   ``It put an end to the financial part of it, but it's something
we have to live with for the rest of our lives, so it never really
ends,'' Mrs. Carpenter said Wednesday.
   The animal killed Nathan Carpenter on Sept. 23, 1988, two hours
after a neighbor adopted it from the Panhandle Animal Welfare
Society based here. The wolf-husky mixed breed was advertised as
``pet of the week.''
   The adoption violated the shelter's policy against placing wolf
breeds, said Donna Olson, the agency's executive director. But a
PAWS lawyer said the settlement reached last Friday does not mean
the shelter admits liability.
   Mrs. Carpenter said she did not recognize the dog when she saw
it running loose near her home in nearby Wynnhaven. When it entered
her yard and lay down 50 feet from her son, she went inside to call
the phone number on the dog's tag.
   ``I looked out the window and saw him ataack Nathan,'' Mrs.
Carpenter said. ``I ran outside and pushed the dog off my son.''
   An off-duty Okaloosa County sheriff's deputy shot the animal.

<HEAD>State Recalls Imitation `Slap Bracelets' After Girl's Injury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state has ordered cheap imitations of
the Slap Wrap removed from shelves after a 4-year-old cut herself
on one of the bracelets.
   The Department of Consumer Protection ordered the recall
Thursday of foreign-made versions of the Connecticut-made Slap Wrap
after several imitations failed safety tests.
   When the 9-inch strip of metal is slapped against the wrist, it
wraps itself around the wearer's arm.
   The department tested three versions of the steel bracelets
encased in cloth for exposed sharp edges, which are prohibited on
most toys under the state's Child Protection Act.
   Only the original Slap Wrap made by Simsbury-based Main Street
Toy passed, said Lois Bryant, director of the department's product
safety division.
   The bracelets that failed the test were imitations, some of them
labeled ``Made in Taiwan'' and some not labeled at all, Bryant
said.
   Illinois-based Walgreen Co. said Thursday it had ordered its
drug stores nationwide to remove ``slap bracelets'' from their
shelves while the safety of the fad jewelry is being investigated.
   Nicole Tomaso cut her finger Tuesday by a piece of metal
protruding from the bracelet she bought at a Walgreens drugstore,
her father, Joseph Tomaso, said.
   When the 9-inch strip of metal is slapped against the wrist, it
wraps itself around the wearer's arm.
   The bracelet that caused the injury was a copy of Slap Wraps,
which sell for $2.49. The imitations cost less, usually 99 cents.
   Main Street Toy maintains its bracelets, made with stainless
steel, are safe, and says imitations are made from cheaper steel
that will rust and break.
   Elementary school officials in Pelham, N.Y., have banned the
wraps because of concerns about children cutting themselves.

   Attempts to reach a plea bargain for
Marlon Brando's son broke down, and a judge set Christian Brando's
murder trial for Nov. 5.
   ``Nobody's talking settlement now,'' Deputy District Attorney
William Clark said after a brief hearing Thursday.
   Clark said that last week Christian Brando's lawyer and
prosecutors discussed a possible plea bargain after it became
apparent Brando's sister, Cheyenne, was unlikely to testify in the
case.
   Clark said defense lawyer Robert Shapiro's proposals were not
accepted.
   But Shapiro told reporters the defense remains open to
negotiations.
   The 32-year-old Brando is charged in the May 16 murder of his
half-sister's Tahitian lover, Dag Drollet, who was fatally shot at
Marlon Brando's hilltop mansion.
   In early statements to police, the young Brando said he didn't
mean to kill the 26-year-old Drollet and suggested they were
struggling over a gun that accidentally fired.
   Prosecutors maintain the shooting was intentional and that
Brando was spurred into a rage by his sister, who said Drollet had
beaten her.
   Superior Court Judge Robert Thomas said jury selection in the
trial would begin Nov. 5. He noted he has received large amounts of
mail indicating strong public sentiment in the case.
   ``If the mail is any indication, there's some very strong
feelings about the matter both ways,'' he said, adding he expects a
difficult search for jurors unaffected by publicity.
   Meanwhile, Clark said he was negotiating with French authorities
to allow Cheyenne Brando's return to the United States to testify.
   She is being held in Tahiti on a charge of accessory to the
murder.
   Miss Brando went to Tahiti in June to have the baby Drollet
fathered. She was later hospitalized with emotional problems,
according to her father, Marlon Brando.
   Clark said Marlon Brando will testify in his son's trial but he
was uncertain whether he would be a prosecution or defense witness.

   After a long 22-month pregnancy and a short
five-hour labor, Bozie, a 15-year-old Asian elephant, has given
birth at Lincoln Park Zoo, officials said.
   ``So far, the mother and baby are doing just fine, and are
getting to know one another,'' said zoo Director Lester Fisher. He
said the zoo staff believes the calf born Thursday is a female, but
they will not know for sure for at least a day.
   Bozie had no apparent difficulty in the delivery, officials
said. She was mated 22 months ago in Springfield, Mo., with Onyx, a
25-year-old bull elephant in the Dickerson Park Zoo.
   Spokeswoman Carol Leifer of the Lincoln Park Zoo said the baby
is only the 16th Asian elephant born in North America since 1985.
Five of those babies died soon after birth.

   A court today convicted a Russian nationalist of
promoting racism and insulting Jews and sentenced him to two years
in a labor camp, ending a three-month trial highlighting fears of
growing anti-Semitism.
   ``I'm suffering for Russia!'' Konstantin Smirnov-Ostashvili
shouted in one of many outbursts during the half-hour session in
the heavily guarded Moscow City Court.
   Andrei Makarov, a prosecutor, said the case shows ``fascism is
being born'' in the Soviet Union, likening the situation to that in
Germany in the 1930s.
   Supporters of Smirnov-Ostashvili heckled Judge Andrei Muratov
repeatedly as he read a summary of the case, then the verdict. They
sometimes drowned him out.
   It was the first such case brought to trial under a law passed
as the Soviet Union grapples with widespread unrest among many of
its more than 100 ethnic groups. Smirnov-Ostashvili, 54, was
charged with inciting hatred between ethnic groups.
   He shouted angrily and raised his fist as the judge read a list
of witnesses who had testified against him: ``Where's the
expertise?''
   ``Everything is taken out of context! It's all a lie!'' he
shouted from behind a brown wooden partition, guarded by five
Interior Ministry soldiers with guns and rubber clubs.
   Smirnov-Ostashvili was accused of organizing protesters who
broke up a meeting at the Central House of Literature in Moscow on
Jan. 18 and insulted Jewish writers.
   The popular weekly publication Ogonyok quoted an unidentified
protester as shouting through a megaphone:
   ``Your time is over. Neither the police, nor the KGB, nor the
party will help yuu. Now we will be masters of the country and you
newcomers, clear out and go to Israel. How long can we tolerate
your Russophobia?''
   Muratov determined Friday that Smirnov-Ostashvili had made those
remarks. The judge said the defendant's diatribe contained
``insulting, demeaning, threatening phrases virtually intended to
humiliate the national honor and dignity of citizens of the Jewish
origin.''
   The court dismissed charges that Smirnov-Ostashvili had used
violence at the writer's meeting but said he had threatened attacks
on Jews.
   The case received wide publicity in the Soviet media at a time
when thousands of Jews are emigrating, many because they fear a
wave of anti-Semitic attacks by extreme Russian nationalist groups.
   The trial followed a five-month investigation during which more
than 400 people were questioned.
   Soviet Jews welcomed the landmark case, which participants said
was the first time an accused anti-Semite has been put on trial in
Russia.
   ``It has shown that there is new fascism in Russia, but it has
also shown that Soviet law has been made to work and come to the
rescue,'' said Alla Geller, a member of the writers group April and
a trial spectator.
   Mikhail Clenov, co-president of Vaad, the Confederation of
Jewish Organizations and Communities in the U.S.S.R., said the
government should now investigate the entire Pamyat group, a
Russian nationalist organization to which the defendant belongs.
   Some of the 100 spectators in court today wore buttons of
Pamyat. They shouted, ``Shame! Shame!'' after the judge read the
sentence. Other spectators were Jews, largely silent during the
sessions.
   Early in the session, a spectator threw a bouquet of red
carnations at Smirnov-Ostashvili, and he held it up and shouted,
``Zionism won't succeed! Long live Russia! ''
   The defendant could have received a maximum penalty of five
years in prison or labor camps, or a fine of up to 5,000 rubles,
about $9,000 at the official exchange rate. The verdict and
sentence were decided by the judge and two civilian assistants,
without a jury.
   He was sentenced to two years in a labor camp.
   Smirnov-Ostashvili has denied being anti-Semitic, but maintains
the Soviet Union's 1.4 million Jews hold a disproportionate number
of high places in government and society.

<HEAD>Philip Bosco Stars in `The Miser' on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS four grafs at end with what other critics said. No PMs
planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thank goodness for star turns.
   Philip Bosco and Carole Shelley are the main reasons to see
``The Miser,'' Moliere's comic portrait of greed incarnate, now
being revived on Broadway by Circle in the Square.
   Their performances dominate an otherwise ordinary production
marred by Stephen Porter's listless direction and some oddly cast
secondary roles.
   Bosco is almost unrecognizable as Harpagon, the man who worships
his money more than life. With a white fright wig and a scruffy,
unshaven face, he looks like Ebenezer Scrooge on a bad day. The
actor is a master of comic timing as he storms around the stage,
blowing out candles - why waste the wax - or ordering his servants
to water the wine.
   Bosco plays Harpagon a little nastier than usual, but it's still
funny. His miser's maniacal devotion to gold makes one a bit
uneasy. There's a hint of venom underneath the obsessiveness, but
it works.
   Besides, not many actors can get a huge laugh just by coughing.
But what a cough. It starts as a low rumble in his throat and
bursts forth like an engine of a 747 cleared for takeoff.
   Shelley, in the much smaller role of the matchmaker Frosine,
matches Bosco quip for quip and laugh for laugh. The production, in
fact, doesn't really come to life until the actress shows up late
in the first act.
   Tarted up in rouge and masses of red curls, Frosine coos her way
into Harpagon's confidence. Shelley and Bosco beautifully play off
each other, mining the humor that Moliere finds in the hypocrisy of
two people using each other for their own ends.
   The plot turns on the usual complications of mismatched couples.
Harpagon, a widower, wants to marry the young lady adored by his
son. His daughter desires a supposedly penniless manservant in the
household while Harpagon plans to marry her off to a wealthy older
man.
   The ending is so blatantly contrived that it earns laughs for
its artificiality. The translation by John Wood certainly is
serviceable, conversational without being too modern.
   But when the two stars are off stage, the production sags.
Harpagon's vexed children, Elise and Cleante, are played by Mia
Dillon and Thomas Gibson. Their performances are marked by some
mighty strange vocal acrobatics. She simpers. He screeches. What
may have been thought of as funny by director Porter becomes
annoying.
   Elise's admirer, Valere, is done in by Christian Baskous' wooden
portrayal in which he seems to be reading his lines from a cue
card. Only John Christopher Jones as the hapless servant Maitre
Jacques can match the comic spirit of Bosco and Shelley.
   Part of the director's problem may be the awkward elongated
playing area with the audience on all four sides. Actors have to
race around the stage, and they do it without much style.
   James Morgan's scenery is sparse but Gail Brassard's costumes
are sumptuous, especially for the foppish son Cleante. But ``The
Miser'' only really comes alive when Bosco and Shelley are center
stage. Without them, the merriment is as minimal as the title
character's gift of giving.
   What other critics said:
   Frank Rich, The New York Times: ``...the production has been
guided with uncharacteristic sloppiness by the Moliere and Shaw
expert (and frequent Bosco collaborator) Stephen Porter. ... Mr.
Bosco deflates much of the evening by wailing and sobbing in grave
self-pity over Harpagon's travails, as if he were somehow imbued
with a tragic awareness more appropriate to Shylock than to a role
with roots in commedia dell'arte.''
   Clive Barnes, New York Post: ``...Bosco ... has never been
better. Sometimes as an actor he suffers from a certain orotund
self-satisfaction, leading to an easily ingratiating superficiality
- best suited to Shaw. But here he attempts something harsher and
funnier.''
   Howard Kissel, Daily News: ``What better way to celebrate the
sentencing of Michael Milken than a revival of Moliere's `The
Miser.' ...By the second act, when the paly itself gathers
momentum, the production becomes as unpretentiously entertaining as
its author intended it to be.''

   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu was greeted by hoots
and catcalls today when he opened a special session of parliament
by urging support for his plan to deploy Japan's Self Defense
Forces overseas for the first time.
   The prime minister told the deeply divided parliament, or Diet,
that Japan's international role is bigger ``than most of us are
aware of.'' Such responsibility, he said, justified dispatching his
proposed United Nations Peace Cooperation Corps to the Persian
Gulf.
   ``We must not forget the fact that Japan is one of the prime
beneficiaries of a world without war,'' Kaifu said. ``Contributing
to maintain world peace is both a natural and inevitable cost
arising from Japan's position within the international community.''
   Kaifu faces powerful opposition over the bill to create the
force.
   Consisting partly of military personnel, the 1,000 to
2,000-member team would perform non-combat services such as
transportation and medical aid to assist the multinational effort
in the gulf.
   The prime minister, however, does not appear to have enough
legislative support to push the bill through. The three largest
opposition parties have said they will not allow its passage.
   ``Such a bill is nothing but a serious challenge to our peace
constitution,'' said Takako Doi, chairwoman of the Socialist Party
- the largest opposition group.
   Japan's Constitution, written after World War II under U.S.
occupation, prohibits the use of force to settle international
disputes.
   But the government, feeling pressure from Washington to increase
its role in the gulf, has said sending military personnel overseas
can be constitutional as long as force is not used and actions are
based on U.N. resolutions.
   Kaifu committed himself to establishing the special corps during
a meeting with President Bush in New York last month.
   Government officials said they will present the bill early next
week.
   The Liberal Democratic Party must win support from one of the
three top opposition groups to push the bill through the upper
house, where it lost a long-held majority in July 1989 elections.
   Japan has pledged $2 billion toward U.S.-led multinational
efforts in the gulf to force Iraq out of Kuwait. It also promised
$2 billion in economic aid to gulf nations hard hit by the
international trade embargo against Iraq.

   A former Citibank manager pleaded guilty to
embezzling $3 million by writing 165 unauthorized bank checks to
buy items ranging from a country home to rare artwork and expensive
jewelery.
   Becky Schafer, 29, who managed the Corporate Trust Services
Department at the bank's Wall Street office, entered the plea
Thursday before Manhattan Federal Judge John Keenan.
   Some restitution has been made, said Assistant U.S. Attorney
Peter Vigeland.
   Schafer, who began her job at Citibank three years ago, admitted
in court to embezzling the funds between December 1987 and last
June.
   It was estimated that hundreds of unauthorized checks were
written, many of them payable to businesses where Schafer went on
spending sprees to buy a BMW car, an expensive house in Kansas
City, Mo., and other luxuries, according to reports in today's
editions of the New York Post and the Daily News.
   ``I was authorized to write checks and caused checks to be
written for my personal use'' Schafer told the judge.
   The Nebraska native quit her job last June and was arrested Aug.
6.
   ``All we can say is that she worked for us from 1985 to June of
this year,'' Citibank spokeswoman Amy Dates said.
   Schafer faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a
$250,000 fine or twice the bank's loss, which Citibank placed at $3
million.

   Gunmen today killed the parliament speaker
and three security men outside a downtown hotel. The attack came
after the government warned that terrorists might strike to punish
Egypt for its opposition to Iraq.
   There was no claim of responsibility for the attack by gunmen on
motorcycles, but the interior minister said he suspected Egyptian
Moslem fundamentalists or foreigners.
   Rifaat el-Mahgoub, 64, speaker of the People's Assembly and the
second ranking politician after the president, was shot as he sat
in the rear of his chauffeur-driven Mercedes, Interior Minister
Abdel-Halim Moussa said. The gunmen then fled as other security men
returned their fire, Moussa said.
   The shooting occurred as el-Mahgoub's car drove by the Hotel
Semiramis Inter-Continental, a block from the U.S. Embassy. The
speaker was heading for a hotel about 1{ miles away where he was to
meet a Syrian delegation.
   Moussa told reporters that four young assailants attacked
el-Mahgoub's vehicle and an accompanying security car from two
Suzuki motorbikes.
   Three escaped on the bikes, he said. They rode through a nearby
underpass in front of the hotel, speeding against the traffic on
the one-way street.
   The fourth ran into a densely populated area nearby and
disappeared. He wounded two bystanders who tried to stop him,
Moussa said.
   The minister, confirming earlier reports, said two security men
were killed in el-Mahgoub's car and another in a security car
traveling behind him.
   An hour after the shooting, el-Mahgoub's black Mercedes sat
outside the hotel, its rear window and right front window smashed.
One of the two slain bodyguards in the car lay in the front seat,
his head torn apart by gunfire.
   A second car - a Peugeot - was stopped about 200 yards away, a
man's body hanging onto the roadway from the rear seat. That man
also was identified as a member of a security detail traveling with
el-Mahgoub.
   All streets were blocked around the 28-story hotel, one of the
newest and most luxurious in Cairo.
   Moussa said the assailants awaited el-Mahgoub's car and escort
with their rifles hidden in handbags.
   One Soviet-made hand grenade and four home-made explosives,
which were timed to explode but didn't, were found on the roadside
near the hotel, Moussa said. Policeman defused them later.
   Moussa said he suspected the attackers were foreigners or local
Moslem fundamentalists. He refused to elaborate.
   Moussa, who said he was traveling 300 yards behind el-Mahgoub's
car during the attack, dismissed questions about whether he was the
intended target. Islamic militants tried to kill an interior
minister with a bomb and shot at two interior ministers in 1987.
One of the ex-ministers was wounded seriously.
   President Hosni Mubarak's predecessor, Anwar Sadat, was killed
Oct. 6, 1981 by Moslem extremists, who then tried and failed to
overthrow the government.
   Today's shooting occurred 90 minutes before Moussa was to have
briefed reporters on the outcome of a national referendum Thursday.
Results showed 93 percent of the Egyptians voting approved
Mubarak's proposal to dissolve the People's Assembly and call new
elections.
   Moussa warned before the vote that Iraqis and other Arabs had
infiltrated the country to destabilize the government through
terror attacks, including assassinations. Egypt has led Arab
opposition to Iraq's annexation of Kuwait.
   It was unclear what effect el-Mahgoub's assassination might have
on the election process. The constitution provides that elections
must be held within 60 days of certification of the referendum
results.
   Mubarak scheduled the referendum because the nation's highest
constitutional court had declared illegal the election laws under
which the parliament was seated.
   Under Egypt's Constitution, el-Mahgoub as parliamentary speaker
was the second-ranking official because Mubarak has not named a
vice president. A political moderate, el-Mahgoub had been speaker
since 1984.
   El-Mahgoub mostly took his cue from Mubarak, and despite his
ranking in Egypt's heirarchy, had little real authority other than
over parliament. His high profile, however, made el-Mahgoub a
relatively easy target for attackers.
   After the shooting, el-Mahgoub's wife was brought to the hotel,
crying hysterically. ``Just let me see him!'' she sobbed.
   In recent weeks, newspaper commentators and cartoonists have
mocked the People's Assembly and indirectly skewered el-Mahgoub for
his position on the referendum. Although he never said so publicly,
he was known to oppose dissolution of the assembly and new
elections.

   The second-season premiere of Fox's ``The
Simpsons'' beat NBC's ``The Cosby Show by half a ratings point,
overnight ratings showed today. But NBC officials were not about to
have a cow, man.
   When the national Nielsens come in, Bill Cosby's series ``in all
likelihood will win,'' said Preston Beckman, NBC vice president for
audience research.
   ``The Simpsons,'' whose reruns have been clobbered by NBC's hit
series since the new season began last month, averaged a 19.9
rating in the 24-city overnight ratings when it began its second
season Thursday night.
   Cosby's show, which began its seventh season last month and has
been a perennial ratings winner, received a 19.3 rating.
   The first half-hour of a new ``Columbo'' episode on ABC was
third in the Thursday ratings battle, averaging an 11.5. A CBS
movie, ``Dark Avenger,'' was left far behind with a 5.2.
   The 24-city overnight ratings represent more than 47 percent of
the nation's 93.1 million TV househoulds, according to Nielsen
Media Research.
   The high ``Simpsons'' ratings were anticipated by NBC, Beckman
said, both because of heavy press coverage of the show's return and
heavy promotion of the show this week by Fox Broadcasting Co.
   ``Fox must have spent an enormous amount on promotion for this
show,'' he said. ``Given all that, it's a good number for him.''
   Can Matt Groening's bug-eyed, big-toothed cartoon clan continue
beating Cosby's Huxtable family?
   ``It's really difficult to say,'' Beckman said. That will become
clearer in about two weeks from now ``when `The Simpsons' aren't on
the cover of every magazine around,'' he said.

<HEAD>Sikh Leader Quits Parliament; More Kashmir Violence Reported</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The leader of the largest Sikh faction
in parliament resigned his seat today and called on the United
Nations to arrange a vote for self-determination in the troubled
state of Punjab.
   Simranjit Singh Mann said in a letter to the speaker that he
quit to protest the extension of federal rule in Punjab and the
refusal to allow elections of a state legislature.
   Parliament overwhelmingly approved extending federal rule to
Punjab last week on the recommendation of Prime Minister V.P.
Singh, who said a fair election free of pressure by militant
separatists could not be guaranteed.
   Meanwhile, in Kashmir, northwest of Punjab, ethnic violence
erupted today when Moslem militants killed three paramilitary
policemen and wounded three others in the city of Sprinagar,
witnesses said.
   They said troops retaliated by setting fire to five houses whose
occupants had fled violent gunbattles earlier in the week.
   About 35 people, mostly non-combatants, have been killed in
fighting between militants and government troops that began in
Sprinagar on Sunday, and about 175 houses destroyed by fire,
residents said.
   Militants and government troops traded gunfire for eight hours
Thursday night in Sopore, 25 miles northwest of Srinagar, according
to witnessses. No deaths were reported, but the residents accused
the government men of setting fire to 60 shops in the Iqbal market.
   At least 1,375 people have been killed in the predominantly
Muslim Kashmir region since Jan. 20, when the government launched
its harshest crackdown ever on the increasingly violent
secessionist movement.
   Meanwhile, in New Delhi, Mann, the Sikh legislator, told foreign
reporters two other party members have said they will quit and
others will follow.
   Mann's Akali Dal faction last year won seven of Punjab's 13
seats in the 529-member lower house of parliament.
   But he declined to take the oath of office when the authorities
refused to let him wear his three-foot-long ceremonial sword.
   Mann was again refused entry into the parliament building today
to submit his resignation when he refused to remove the curved
sword strapped across his shoulder. He waited 45 minutes for an
official to come and take the letter, news agencies reported.
   An average of about a dozen people are killed every day by Sikh
militants in Punjab, a farming state bordering Pakistan. Sikhs have
a slight majority in Punjab but make up only 2 percent of India's
total population of 880 million.
   Mann said that in the 41 months since the dismissal of the state
legislature, Punjab had become a colony of India. He called for a
U.N.-supervised referendum in Punjab to decide its future.
   ``An international effort is required to get us out of this
colonial state,'' he said. ``I think this will have to go to the
United Nations.''

   Parliament Speaker Rifaat el-Mahgoub always
lacked the charisma of other political leaders, but he served
President Hosni Mubarak's interests well as the nation's
second-ranking politician.
   From the time he took over as head of the People's Assembly in
1984, until he was assassinated today, el-Mahgoub, 64, steered
Egypt's unicameral legislature as Mubarak's government and National
Democratic Party wanted.
   As parliament speaker, he was supposed to be neutral, a sort of
umpire, between the governing party's majority in the 485-member
chamber and the opposition, which held about 100 seats.
   However, el-Mahgoub's preference for the governing party was
evident, sometimes brazen, in his conduct of debates.
   He used his authority to push through or shelve legislation in
accordance with government wishes. This prompted attacks by
opposition parties, who characterized him as a dictator.
   Tall, lean and bespectacled, el-Mahgoub almost always appeared
stiff and stern during parliamentary sessions. He often made quick
rulings on the outcome of voting by a show of hands, without
bothering to count.
   The People's Assembly elected el-Mahgoub speaker in 1984 and
again in 1987. In this post, he was the country's second-highest
official in protocol, but he had no real power over national
policy.
   Mubarak suspended the assembly Sept. 26 and called a referendum,
held Thursday, that gave him a mandate to dissolve parliament. This
was necessary because Egypt's highest court ruled in June that the
assembly was elected under an unconstitutional law and was
therefore illegal.
   The outgoing chamber was crisis-ridden from the start. A Cairo
court ruled that 78 seats held by National Democrats rightfully
belonged to opposition party members. An appeals court agreed.
   But the assembly ignored the ruling.
   El-Mahgoub cited a legal provision that on parliamentary
membership issues, the assembly is ``master of its own decision.''
   El-Mahgoub graduated from Cairo University's law school in 1948
and obtained a doctorate degree in economy from the University of
Paris five years later. He assumed several academic posts,
including dean of the College of Economy and Political Sciences. He
became minister for presidential affairs in 1972 and deputy prime
minister three years later.
   The minister is survived by his wife and four children.

<HEAD>School To Give Phys Ed Credit For Reading Pamphlets About Exercise</HEAD>

   Put away the sweats and put on your
glasses.
   The only physical exertion some high school juniors and seniors
will have to do next year for credit is to occasionally lift their
eyelids, or at least say they did.
   The Pittsfield School Committee voted this week to let students
fulfill physical education requirements by reading about exercise.
   Starting next September students will have three options. They
can take gym classes once or twice a week or enroll in the reading
program. The current requirement is gym twice a week.
   Under the minimum option, students will be able to tell teachers
they have read assigned pamphlets about health and physical
exercise. No tests, papers or classes will be required.
   School Committee member George Desnoyers contended that juniors
and seniors are old enough to choose whether to exercise. He wanted
to eliminate the physical education requirement altogether, but
it's required by state law.
   ``Kids should be encouraged to participate in sports, like
intramural sports or joining the Y or the Girls' Club, but the
school day is too short, the school year is too short and something
has got to give,'' said school committee member George B. Crane.
   Angel G. Ramirez cast the lone opposition vote. He said too many
young people loaf around watching television instead of exercising.

<HEAD>Employers to Prepay Wage Taxes to Help City in Cash Crunch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several of the largest employers in the city
have agreed to prepay $50 million in wage taxes to help the city
government, which is expected to go broke in December.
   The prepayers include the University of Pennsylvania, Bell of
Pennsylvania, Philadelphia Electric Co. and Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia, according to reports today in The Philadelphia
Inquirer and the Philadelphia Daily News.
   The city failed last month to sell $375 million worth of
temporary loan notes meant to keep it going until spring, when
property tax payments are due. Lenders apparently were scared off
by the city's projected $206 million budget deficit.
   A spokeswoman for the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce said the
tax prepayments would be announced today.
   The city spends about $9 million a day, so the $50 million
prepayment would only keep the government going for 5{ days beyond
Dec. 1, when Mayor W. Wilson Goode has said the city will run out
of cash.
   ``We don't want to overblow this as anything more than a show of
confidence,'' Chamber of Commerce Vice President Nicholas
DeBenedictis told the Daily News.
   DeBenedictis said the prepayment, however, was a step in the
right direction.
   ``Our immediate problem is getting cash, and we need some
confidence going, some positive action,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A gigantic image of President Dwight D.
Eisenhower will appear in the sky over Abilene and deliver a speech
in the finale of events marking the centennial of his birth.
   The 50-minute ceremony Sunday night at the Eisenhower Center is
designed with one thing in mind, said Richard N. Smith, interim
director of the research facility and museum.
   ``This will be unadulterated fun and flag waving and
fireworks,'' Smith said.
   The laser show will be a highlight of a weekend of activities
solemn and salutary expected to draw up to 50,000 people. The
central Kansas town the country's 34th president called home might
feel a little crowded. It's population is 6,300.
   Eisenhower was born Oct. 14, 1890, in Denison, Texas, but grew
up in Abilene. A military career begun in West Point led to service
as supreme Allied commander during World War II. In peacetime, the
popular Republican served as president from 1953 to 1961. He died
in 1969.
   Sunday would have been Eisenhower's 100th birthday.
   Evoking the man and his era will be World War II veterans in
uniform, vintage military aircraft, even a USO show.
   War veterans are coming in on the sort of troop trains that took
them from their homes 50 years ago. Some will form a
battalion-sized encampment at Eisenhower Park.
   Even a contingent of Soviets, U.S. allies in World War II, is
expected to swing down from Lawrence, where they are attending the
Meeting for Peace.
   A new postage stamp will be unveiled marking the centennial of
Eisenhower's birth.
   Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will
represent President Bush at a wreath-laying ceremony Sunday at the
tomb of Eisenhower and his wife, Mamie.
   The Rev. Billy Graham will lead an ecumenical service featuring
singers from every Abilene church choir.
   Eisenhower will get in the last word, however.
   As the late president's image looms overhead, his words will be
heard.
   ``Eisenhower will be resurrected at the last moment on this
screen and we'll gradually bring the figure into the heavens, and
he'll speak, then the figure will dissipate into the clouds,'' said
Gary Caimano of Tamerlane Productions, the Fort Worth, Texas,
company coordinating the show.
   The speech will be one Eisenhower gave in 1945 on returning home
from the war.
   ``We took it from that directly,'' Caimano said. ``We didn't
change anything, but the words he says will be appropriate for
today.''

   House Democrats rallied around a liberal
budget plan today that lays new taxes on the wealthy. Divided
Republicans, meanwhile, seemed ready to ignore President Bush's
conclusion that a deep cut in the capital gains tax is dead.
   ``There was a very strong positive attitude on the part of
members,'' Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., told reporters after a
Democratic caucus. ``There's a sense of unity.''
   The Democratic plan would boost taxes on wealthier Americans and
offer a small capital-gains tax cut for middle-income families. It
is one of many budget proposals sprouting all over Capitol Hill
amid frustration over Bush's blurry position on taxing the rich.
   House Republicans were honing a plan that would hold this year's
spending to last year's levels. It would also cut the capital gains
tax deeply while gently raising income taxes on the wealthy, a
trade Bush likes but has said is unattainable because of Democratic
opposition.
   ``We're doing a House Republican position,'' said Rep. Mickey
Edwards, R-Okla. ``We're not developing a White House position.
That's different.''
   At the Wht summit agreement.
   As a result, the Democrats would impose a lesser boost ontthe
monthly premium that Medicare beneficiaries pay for doctors'
coverage. The annual $75 deductible paid by participants for
doctors' expenses would increase, but also at a lesser rate.

<HEAD>Thatcher: Be Ready for War if Sanctions Fail</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Thatcher's keynote address. No

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
signaling increasing British impatience with the Persian Gulf
standoff, told her Conservative Party today to be prepared for war
if sanctions fail.
   ``We must hope they work. If not, the military option is there.
... We must be ready for any contingency,'' she said in her keynote
address, winding up the Tories' four-day annual conference.
   Amid applause from the 5,000 delegates, Mrs. Thatcher also said
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein must face war crimes charges, pay
reparation for the devastation of Kuwait and be stripped of power
to mount new attacks.
   ``This tyrant has taken our people hostage,'' she said. ``You
get him out, make him pay and see that he is never in a position to
do these things again.''
   Mrs. Thatcher spoke a day after Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd
said the international community must assess within weeks whether
sanctions are working -and whether only force can end Saddam's Aug.
2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Mrs. Thatcher praised President Bush for taking the lead in the
gulf crisis, adding: ``In times of great crisis, Britain and the
United States stand as always together.''
   She focused most of her keynote address on trying to rally the
party, which, despite promises of better economic times ahead, is
running out of time to reverse its long lag in opinion poll
ratings.
   On Britain's relations with the rest of the 12-nation European
Community - the issue that is dividing her Cabinet - she was
adament that she will fight plans for economic integration with a
single currency.
   ``Europe cannot be built by ... trying to turn us into regions
rather than nations,'' she declared.
   Mrs. Thatcher's personal ratings have been boosted by the gulf
crisis and the fresh life that her swift dispatch of British forces
has given to the Anglo-American relationship. Britain had seemed
overshadowed by the emergence of a reunified Germany as the
dominant West European power.
   Still, the conference has produced signs of anxiety that after
11 years in power, the Conservatives are running out of new ideas.
   ``We have to avoid looking like custodians of a finished
process, designers whose work is done,'' declared Sir Geoffrey
Howe, the deputy prime minister.
   Security has been extraordinarily tight at the meeting to
prevent a possible IRA attack.
   On Thursday night, police arrested a woman found with two
gasoline bombs in a parking lot 200 yards from the conference
center and hotel where Mrs. Thatcher is staying. However, police
spokesman Brian Jones said: ``This was definitely not a terrorist
attack.''
   He said the middle-aged woman appeared mentally disturbed. She
was spotted with the devices - milk bottles containing gasoline -
by a police patrol. One bottle had exploded and the other was still
intact. There was no damage.
   The convention center and Mrs. Thtcher's Hycliff Hotel are
ringed by a six-foot spiked fence as part unprecedented security
amid new fears of an assassination attempt by the outlawed Irish
Republican Army.
   The IRA, fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland,
killed a Conservative Party legislator in July and attempted to
kill a government minister last month.
   At the 1984 Conservative conference, IRA guerrillas blew up Mrs.
Thatcher's hotel, killing five party members.

   Genetics, not the social class of a family, is
the strongest influence on intelligence, according to a study of
identical twins who were raised separately.
   The study, published today in the journal Science, said that
twins who were raised separately scored close to the same values in
three intelligence tests taken as adults.
   Thomas J. Bouchard, a University of Minnesota professor who
directed the study, said that it shows that inherited
characteristics is the most powerful contributor to intelligence.
He and his colleagues found that 70 percent of the influence on IQ
scores was genetics and only about 30 percent was as a result of
environment.
   ``While 70 percent of the variation in IQ in this group is due
to genetic factors, that still leaves considerable room for
environmental influences,'' Bouchard said. ``But whatever those
influences are, social class isn't one of them.''
   In the Science report, Bouchard and his colleagues said that
socioeconomic effects have been found to influence IQ scores for
young but not among adults.
   This suggests, the study said, that ``although parents may be
able to affect their children's rate of cognitive skill
acquisition, they may have relatively little influence on the
ultimate level attained.''
   The study is based on evaluations of 50 pairs of twins who were
separated in childhood, raised apart, and then reunited as adults.
   Bouchard cautioned that the findings cannot be applied to people
in extreme circumstances since none of those studied were retarded
or raised by very poor or illiterate parents.
   ``They do indicate that, in the current environments of the
broad middle class, in industrialized societies, two-thirds of the
observed variance of IQ can be traced to genetic variation,'' the
study said.
   The study also evaluated the attitudes, interests and
personalities of the raised-apart twins and found what was called
``remarkable similarity.''
   Childhood environmental influences also seemed to have little
effect on physical and emotional traits. Identical twins, the study
said, ``are about equally similar on most physiological and
psychological traits, regardless of rearing status.''
   Bouchard's study is in conflict with some earlier separated
twins studies that attributed only about half of the similarity in
IQ scores to genetics and said that environmental effects would
have a stronger influence on the adult intelligence measures.
   Co-authors with Bouchard in the study were David T. Lykken,
Matthew McGue, Nancy L. Segal and Auke Tellegen, all of the
University of Minnesota.
   Science, which published the Minnesota study, is the journal of
the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

   Dr. John Talbott, a physician,
researcher and teacher who edited the Journal of the American
Medical Association, has died of cancer. He was 88.
   He died at home Wednesday.
   Talbott edited the medical journal fored to elaborate.
   Moussa, who said he was traveling 300 yards behind el-Mahgoub's
car during the attack, dismissed questions about whether he was the
intended target. Islamic militants tried to kill an interior
minister with a bomb and shot at two interior ministers in 1987.
One of the ex-ministers was wounded seriously.
   President Hosni Mubarak's predecessor, Anwar Sadat, was killed
Oct. 6, 1981 by Moslem extremists, who then tried and failed to
overthrow the government.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We
are shocked by the assassination.'' He said the United States
deplored the attack and had no indication who carried it out.
   Today's shooting occurred 90 minutes before Moussa was to have
briefed reporters on the outcome of a national referendum Thursday.
Results showed 93 percent of the Egyptians voting approved
Mubarak's proposal to dissolve the People's Assembly and call new
elections.
   Moussa warned before the vote that Iraqis and other Arabs had
infiltrated the country to destabilize the government through
terror attacks, including assassinations. Egypt has led Arab
opposition to Iraq's annexation of Kuwait.
   It was unclear what effect el-Mahgoub's assassination might have
on the election process. The constitution provides that elections
must be held within 60 days of certification of the referendum
results.
   Mubarak scheduled the referendum because the nation's highest
constitutional court had declared illegal the election laws under
which the parliament was seated.
   Under Egypt's Constitution, el-Mahgoub as parliamentary speaker
was the second-ranking official because Mubarak has not named a
vice president. A political moderate, el-Mahgoub had been speaker
since 1984.
   El-Mahgoub mostly took his cue from Mubarak, and despite his
ranking in Egypt's heirarchy, had little real authority other than
over parliament. His high profile, however, made el-Mahgoub a
relatively easy target for attackers.
   After the shooting, el-Mahgoub's wife was brought to the hotel,
crying hysterically. ``Just let me see him!'' she sobbed.
   In recent weeks, newspaper commentators and cartoonists have
mocked the People's Assembly and indirectly skewered el-Mahgoub for
his position on the referendum. Although he never said so publicly,
he was known to oppose dissolution of the assembly and new
elections.

   Despite last-minute concessions by civil

   ``We still believe this is a quota bill,'' Bush's press
secretary, Marlin Fitzwater told reporters. ``We continue to
believe a veto is warranted on that basis.''
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh also told Congress that Bush
would veto the proposed civil rights bill. He said in a letter to
Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole that changes put forth by
House-Senate conferees ``do not offer substantial improvement'' and
``in some respects they make the bill worse.''
   Civil rights forces had hoped that changes adopted by the
conferees in the job discrimination legislation would overcome Bush
administration fears that the bill would encourage employers to
adopt hiring quotas to avoid lawsuits.
   But the attorney general's letter made clear that the changes
had no effect on the Bush administration's position.
   ``Accordingly, the president will be compelled to veto S 2104 in
its current form,'' Thornburgh said in a letter released by the
Justice Department.
   Bush has said he wants to sign a civil rights bill this year.
But Fitzwater said the White House will not accept the current
version despite changes that Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif.,
said backers hoped were ``more in line with the president's
views.''
   The key change would offer employers greater leeway in defending
against discrimination suits. It also would make clear that nothing
in the bill was designed to encourage the use of hiring quotas.
   But Thornburgh said ``the new language makes no material
change'' in the bill, which Bush had previously threatened to veto.
``The words are different, but the meaning and effect are the same,
and there is no improvement.''
   ``The trouble with the bill is not that it explicitly
`encourages' or `requires' quotas, but that it will inevitably
result in quotas being adopted surreptitiously to avoid the cost
and trouble'' of lawsuits, Thornburgh wrote.
   ``The assertion that the bill ought not have this effect cannot
change the fact that it will,'' the attorney general said.
   The legislation, the top legislative priority of the civil
rights movement, would negate six Supreme Court decisions last
year.
   Main features would change complex courtroom procedures in a way
that would make it harder for employers to defend against
discrimination suits.
   Other provisions range from a ban on racial harassment on the
job to removal of obstacles to reopening court-approved minority
hiring agreements.
   Critics in the administration and the business community say the
bill would make it so difficult for employers to win discrimination
suits that they would turn to hiring quotas as a way of heading off
such charges.
   A House-Senate conference committee that already had produced a
compromise version of the bill went back to work Thursday night and
adopted a seven-point package of concessions designed to win Bush's
backing.
   Supporters said that even if the president remains opposed, the
changes might attract the two-thirds congressional support for the
bill needed to override his threatened veto.
   The package was adopted 11-8 by the conference committee.
   Rep. Craig Washington, D-Texas, a strong supporter of civil
rights, voted with critics against the package. He said the changes
turned the measure into ``the hollow shell of a civil rights
bill.''
   Washington said long delays in sending the bill to the White
House most likely will enable Bush to stop the bill with a ``pocket
veto'' if he so desires.
   Under a pocket veto, the president is able to kill bills by
simply refusing to sign them when Congress is not in session.
Lawmakers are getting ready to leave Washington for a round of
campaigning before November elections.
   ``I'm not criticizing them, they're senators and stuff,''
Washington said, nodding toward Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
``But we could have done this three weeks ago.''
   Hawkins, also a strong civil rights supporter, said it was time
to ``come up with something we hope is more in line with the
president's views.''

   The House today turned aside an
across-the-board cut in 1991 defense spending despite lawmakers'
warnings of a depression if Congress fails to reduce the military
budget.
   ``Is it going to be guns or is it going to be bankruptcy?'' Rep.
James Traficant, D-Ohio, asked his colleagues prior to the vote on
an amendment imposing a 5 percent cut on all defense programs.
   By a resounding 319-97, the House defeated the measure as
lawmakers worked with rapid-fire speed on a $268 billion defense
spending plan that makes wholesale cuts in President Bush's fiscal
1991 budget request.
   The legislation halts production of the B-2 stealth bomber at
five planes, slashes Bush's proposal for the Strategic Defense
Initiative to $2.3 billion and reduces U.S. forces by 77,000.
   ``We're moving in the right direction, stressing more
conventional weapons, less strategic weapons,'' said Rep. John
Murtha, D-Pa., chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on
defense.
   As members pushed to complete the bill and recess for their
first weekend off in three weeks, large chunks of thar Wars that delays
early deployment and cuts the
number of U.S. troops by 100,000.
   Facing increasing congressional discontent with the stealth
aircraft and its manufacturer, the Northrop Corp., the
administration stepped up its effort to save the bomber on
Thursday.
   In a letter to members of the House and Senate Armed Services
committees, Bush said the bomber is imperative to U.S.-Soviet
negotiations to limit strategic weapons.
   Meanwhile, Air Force Secretary Donald Rice pleaded with
lawmakers not to decide the fate of the B-2 based on an Air Force
review that found widespread problems in nearly every aspect of
Northrop's business.
   Earlier this week, Brig. Gen. Robert W. Drewes, who led the
eight-man team that conducted the study, told a House panel that
Northrop was deficient in six major areas, including cost and
schedule estimates.
   The review did not delve into problems associated with ongoing
federal probes of the Los Angeles-based company. Northrop pleaded
guilty in February to 34 counts of fraud and was fined $17 million,
the largest criminal fine ever imposed on a defense contractor.
   The plea stems from charges that Northrop falsified reports on
the air-launched cruise missile and conducted improper tests on the
Harrier AV-8B jet.

   Riding beside her husband as they drove
through the dark in a blinding rain, Brenda Urban gave birth to a
boy who couldn't wait for a tropical storm to subside.
   At 4 a.m. Thursday in the downpour from Tropical Storm Marco,
Mrs. Urban and her husband, Rick, were speeding across the
three-mile Howard Frankland Bridge. They were trying to get from
their home in Lutz to a midwife birthing center 45 miles away in
St. Petersburg.
   ``We were just to the edge of the bridge when I said, `This
baby's coming out,'' Mrs. Urban said.
   ```It was scary, being stuck on the Howard Frankland with no end
in sight,'' said her husband, Rick, a computer salesman. ``I was
prepared to stop on the middle of the bridge and take care of it
right then.''
   But a tractor-trailer was bearing down behind them and they
couldn't stop. Neither could their first baby.
   ``It went real fast,'' Mrs. Urban said. ``My husband just
reached his arm down and held the baby's head till we got across.''
   At the other end of the bridge they pulled over, unwrapped the
cord from the newborn's neck and laid him on his mother to keep him
warm.
   ``I kept saying, `I can't believe we had our baby in the car,''
she said.
   Mrs. Urban eventually made it to Bayfront Medical Center.
Emergency workers suggested the baby be named Howard Marco. The
Urbans declined.
   Garrett Michael Urban, 6 pounds, 2 ounces, was declared to be in
good health. The family went home Thursday, about time the first
rays of sun appeared through the receding storm clouds.
   ``It was a pretty nerve-wracking experience,'' said the father.
He said the episode taught him to ``plan ahead and get a closer
delivery site.''

   Paintings, jewelry and other valuables that
belonged to a 17th century Spanish queen and were stolen from an
Italian museum have been recovered at a Swiss railroad station,
officials reported Friday.
   Prosecutor Federico Prato said the stolen artworks were found in
boxes in the baggage deposit at the station in Mendrisio, just
across the border from Italy.
   Recovered Wednesday were 31 items of the so-called ``Treasure of
Loreto'' which had been stolen from the museum in Chiusa, near
Bolzano in northeastern Italy, in May 1986.
   They included four 16th century paintings, valuable china, a
silver cup, an ancient Mass book and jewels.
   They stolen items once belonged to Queen Mria Anna of Spain,
the widow of Charles II. Italian art experts consider them
priceless.
   Police said the thieves had recently tried to sell some of the
pieces in Switzerland and Germany.
   No arrests were immediately reported and no details of the
operation were given, except that it was carried out in cooperation
with Swiss authorities.
   Some of the stolen artworks are still missing.

   The government faces legal action unless it alters
a planned high-speed rail line through the territory of two rare
eagles, a zoo director said Friday.
   Didier Pons, who runs a zoo in the southern town of Saint-Canat
near the eagle habitat, said France would violate a 1989 European
Community conservation accord if it constructs the track along the
intended route between Lyon and Marseille.
   The eagles in the area are one of 31 pairs of Bonelli eagles
recorded in France, according to conservationists. Experts say the
birds cannot live in captivity and are unable to procreate except
in their own territory.
   Pons said Transport Minister Michel Delebarre, when informed of
the problem in June, responded with an ``utterly useless'' proposal
to shift the proposed track by 100 yards in the affected area.
   Pons said the environmental wing of the European Community will
take the case to the European Court of Justice if French
authorities ignore requests to ensure the eagles' protection.

   A clandestine firecracker factory
exploded in the central Philippines, killing five people and

   Police quoted some of the injured as saying they were making
firecrackers from 22 pounds of chloride nitrate when one of them
accidentally ignited the chemical, which was kept in a drum.
   The drum exploded, causing the two-story house, which was made
of light materials, to collapse along with three concrete walls
nearby.
   Policewoman Cpl. Filomena Grandea said the accident took place
Thursday in Bacolod City on Negros island, about 300 miles
southeast of Manila.
   The manufacture of firecrackers is banned in the Philippines but
the practice is tolerated, especially when the Christmas and New

<HEAD>Kaifu Calls Justice Minister's Remarks `Extremely Inappropriate'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the face of rising U.S. anger, Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu again expressed deep regret Friday over the remarks
of a Cabinet minister who compared black Americans to prostitutes.
   ``The statement by the minister of justice is extremely
inappropriate and extremely regrettable. Since he is a member of my
Cabinet, I have given a stern warning to him,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Taizo Watanabe quoted Kaifu as telling Japanese
reporters.
   Although Kaifu has previously expressed regret over the remarks
made last month by Justice Minister Seiroku Kajiyama, the issue has
failed to die.
   Japanese commentators have expressed worry that the controversy,
the latest involving insulting remarks made by a Japanese official
about U.S. minorities, may inflame growing trade tensions.
   On Thursday, the U.S. Congressional Black Caucus said its
members have submitted a resolution to Congress calling on Japan to
fire Kajiyama.
   The city of Trenton, N.J. reportedly canceled a planned visit by
members of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly.
   And a group representing all 26 African ambassadors in Japan
visited the Foreign Ministry to protest the remarks and demand more
awareness of racial issues among Japanese officials.
   On Sept. 21, Kajiyama told reporters after the arrests of
foreign prostitutes in a Tokyo red-light district that such people
``ruin the atmosphere'' of neighborhoods.
   ``It's like in America when neighborhoods become mixed because
blacks move in and whites are forced out,'' he said.
   Watanabe quoted Kaifu as saying he was ``saddened and very much
contrite over this inappropriate statement, which has given
feelings of deep unpleasantness to many people, including
Afro-American people.''
   Kaifu said he was determined to ``implant a correct recognition
of minority issues among the Japanese people,'' and noted that
Kajiyama had retracted his comments and apologized to U.S.
Ambassador Michael Armacost.
   Watanabe said Kaifu did not indicate whether the Cabinet
minister would resign.

   Rebounding automobile purchases and surging
gasoline prices powered retail sales to a strong 1.1 percent gain
in September, the government said Friday.
   That was the biggest advance in four months, but economists said
the two special factors were masking an otherwise weak report,
which included a large decline in department store sales.
   Sales figures are not adjusted to factor out price increases.
Gasoline costs have shot up since Iraq occupied Kuwait Aug. 2,
inflating that sales category.
   The recovery in auto sales was positive but came after months of
deteriorating sales, analysts said.
   Overall, sales rose $1.6 billion to a seasonally adjusted $151.2
billion, the Commerce Department said. That followed a 0.4 percent
decline in August.
   ``What is underscored by these numbers is that the process of
economic decline is a very slow one. Consumers take two steps
backward and then one step forward, at least if they're given a
bargain as they were with autos,'' said economist David Jones of
Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co.
   Retail sales are an important barometer of economic health
because they represent about one-third of the nation's economic
activity.

   British Airways and the Soviet Ministry of Civil
Aviation have joined forces to form a new airline called Air Russia
to fly passengers from Moscow to Europe, North America and the Far
East, British Airways said Friday.
   With the Soviet Union moving toward a market economy ``an
efficient, competitive, international airline service will be a
commercial necessity,'' said British Airways Chairman Lord King.
   The Soviet Union's state-run Aeroflot has a poor reputation for
safety and service.
   Currently, Aeroflot, British Airways, Pan American World
Airways, Virgin Atlantic Airways and most major European airlines
fly in and out of Moscow.
   British Airways said it signed a protocol agreement with the
Ministry of Civil Aviation on Friday in Moscow with a view to
forming the joint venture airline.
   Aeroflot would hold a majority stake in the joint venture and
British Airways would invest $39 million for the minority stake.
   Air Russia would begin flying passengers from Moscow's
Domodedovo airport in 1992, operating a new fleet of aircraft,
British Airways said.
   The proposals also call for building a new international
terminal at the airport and creating an aircraft leasing company
that would be jointly owned by Aeroflot, British Airways and a
consortium of financial institutions.

   A court issued a warrant Friday for the
arrest of the former mayor of Nice, who resigned last month after
24 years in office and took refuge in South America.
   Jacques Medecin quit on Sept. 16, 10 days before he was
scheduled to appear in court to face possible charges of financial
misconduct.
   If Medecin, 62, does not return promptly to France to answer the
charges, he could be tried in absentia. If convicted in such a
trial, he would face the prospect of immediate imprisonment should
he return later.
   The warrant is not valid internationally, and will not trigger
any bid to have Medecin arrested in South America, officials said.
   However, investigations of Medecin's financial affairs continue,
and authorities have left open the possibility that an
international arrest warrant could be issued eventually.
   According to investigators, Medecin was a majority stockholder
in a magazine which obtained much of its advertising revenue from
the city of Nice and from the regional administrative council.
Medecin was the council's president.
   He also was accused of improperly shifting funds to cover
municipal debts.
   Medecin, who has spent time in Uruguay and Argentina since his
resignation, has said he has no immediate plans to return France,
but might do so if his lawyers recommend it.
   The resignation ended a family dynasty in Nice. Medecin was born
in 1928, the same year his gather, Jean, became mayor of the
Riviera city.
   Jean Medecin held the post for 38 years, until his son succeeded
him in 1966.

<HEAD>OSHA Establishes Regulations in Response to L'Ambiance Collapse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal agency established new construction
regulations Friday stemming from the 1987 collapse of L'Ambiance
Plaza in Bridgeport, Conn., that claimed 28 lives.
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations
include a requirement that non-essential workers clear out when the
lift-slab method of construction is in use. Such a rule would have
saved most of those killed at L'Ambiance, officials said at a
signing ceremony in which the regulations were formally enacted.
   ``We often hear we have too much regulation, that we need less
government,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., whose district
includes Bridgeport and who lobbied for regulatory changes. ``Well
this is a classic example of where you needed more government and
where you needed more regulation.''
   On April 23, 1987, hydraulic jacks being used to hoist slabs of
concrete flooring into place at the L'Ambiance Plaza construction
site failed, causing the entire building to collapse. Twenty-eight
workers were killed and dozens were injured in the worst workplace
accident in the United States in nearly a decade.
   Only seven of those killed were working on the floor lifting
job. Others were performing a variety of construction jobs
throughout the building site.
   OSHA chief Gerard F. Scannell acknowledged ``a lot of criticism
on the slowness of promulgating standards.'' The 125 pages of new
regulations took three-and-a-half years to put in place. But
Scannell said the rgulatory process of study, hearings and comment
made the delay inevitable.
   OSHA officials estimated that the new rules would cost the
construction industry only about $400,000 per year. The rules also
require that:
   - Employers provide independent engineering review to ensure
structural integrity if workers are allowed to remain in the
building site.
   - Lift-slab operations must be designed and planned by a
registered professional engineer.
   - Jacks must be able to support more than twice their rated
weight.
   - Lifting systems must be designed so that the failure of any
one jack does not cause a collapse.
   Scannell said that in 1987, the most recent year for which
statistics are available, less than 1 percent of the 1 million
square feet of commercial and industrial space constructed involved
the lift-slab technique.

   United Press International said Friday it
would dismiss an unspecified number of employees and concentrate
its reporting on 15 populous states.
   ``There will be some people who will get dismissal notices,''
Milt Capps, the news service's senior vice president for corporate
affairs, said.
   ``There will be some ups in some places and some downs in others
to maintain the staffing equilibrium,'' Capps said. ``We will have
as many people reporting as we have had, given that we are also
relying on stringer correspondents and subcontractors.''
   Capps declined to say how many people were being laid off.
   Capps said UPI would continue to have bureaus in ``virtually
every state'' and had no plans to announce any bureau closures any
time soon.
   The 83-year-old wire service announced last month it was closing
bureaus in five states.
   UPI Executive Vice President Pieter Vanbennekom said UPI plans
to intensify its reporting of business and finance, economics and
trade, government, crime and ``quality of life'' issues.
   He said wires known as MetroRegional wires would be established
serving California, New York, New Jersey, Texas, Pennsylvania,
Illinois, Michigan, Florida, Ohio, Massachusetts, Indiana, New
Hampshire, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia.
   UPI derives about 82 percent of its revenue from the 15 states,
Vanbennekom said.
   Similar wires may be established in other states in 1992,
depending on the success of the program, he said.

<HEAD>First Nationwide Anti-Drug Campaign For Hispanic Children Launched</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A campaign launched Friday is the first
nationwide effort aimed at discouraging drug and alcohol use among
Hispanic children.
   The campaign is called ``Piensalo!,'' which is Spanish for
``Think about it!'' It is sponsored by the Department of Health and
Human Services and the National Coalition for Hispanic Health and
Human Services Organization.
   ``Like many others, the Hispanic community has developed very
serious alcohol and other drug problems,'' said Surgeon General
Antonia Novello, the first Hispanic to hold that position.
   ``Our children are watching us,'' she said. ``The tragedy is
that our children witness adult behavior and may mistakenly think
that this is the norm.''
   The campaign is targeted to Hispanic children between the ages
of 8 and 12.
   It includes information booklets for parents, teachers and
children, posters featuring Hispanic celebrities and public service
announcements by Dr. Novello and Health and Human Services
Secretary Louis Sullivan.
   The government spent $900,000 developing, producing and
distributing the materials for the campaign, said HHS spokeswoman

   The campaign was being kicked off in nine cities with large
Hispanic populations: Denver, New York, Tucson, Salt Lake City, San
Antonio, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami and San Juan, Puerto Rico.
   A recent study found that 33 percent of Hispanics under age 21
used alcohol during a one-month period, officials said. Another
study indicated that Hispanics ages 12-17 were more likely to use
cocaine than white or black Americans of that age.

<HEAD>Three More Spies Arrested as Dragnet Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief federal prosecutor's office
announced Friday the arrest of three more alleged former spies for
East Germany, the latest in a series of captures.
   The prosecutor's office identified the alleged spies only as Dr.
Stefan E. and Gunther N. from Berlin, and Gerd K. from Hanover.
   Stefan E., 36, was responsible for preparing intelligence
reports and was the control officer for Klaus Kuron, a top spy, who
turned himself in on Sunday, the prosecutor's office said.
   Kuron started naming names, and his testimony led to the arrest
of eight other alleged spies. According to the prosecutor's office,
Stefan E. tried to persuade Kuron to work for the Soviet KGB just a
week ago.
   Gunther N., 53, also worked for the Stasi, as the East German
security service was called, and was involved with working with
Kuron.
   The prosecutor's officer said that Gerd K., 40, had been trained
in the intelligence services. The office did not provide details as
to the nataure of Gerd K.'s crimes.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government has appealed to former East
German spies to give themselves up. They are likely to receive
lighter sentences if they give up and start talking.
   The prosecutor's office says there is a pool of 8,0000 former
East German spies loose. The arrests could continue for months.
   Germany was a hotbed of spy activity when the country was still
divided and its two parts formed the front of the Cold War.

   A gunman fired at Gen. Michel Aoun today
as he addressed thousands of supporters in the Christian enclave,
but the bullet missed the general and struck one of his aides,
Aoun's radio station said.
   The assault came shortly after the Syrian army moved thousands
of troops toward the enclave for an expected attack on Aoun's
headquarters.
   The radio said Aoun's supporters saw the gunman aiming a pistol
at the general and pushed him before it went off. The radio said
the assailant was questioned by military officials and confessed
that he was ordered to kill Aoun. The radio did not say who gave
those orders. The report also did not identify the aide who was hit
or describe the extent of his injuries.
   The broadcast said the attack came as Aoun talked to his
supporters who have formed a human shield around the presidential
palace in the encircled Christian enclave in an attempt to
forestall the expected Syrian attack.
   ``I am ready to die on the battlefield of honor rather than
surrender. Be sure I shall die fighting,'' Aoun told the cheering
crowds around the hilltop palace east of Beirut in Baabda,
Lebanon's Christian heartland.
   The Syrians overnight moved thousands of troops and dozens of
tank columns to the major entrances of Aoun's territory in what a
Lebanese government official said was ``another step in the march
to end Aoun's mutiny.''
   Syria's troops support the government of President Elias Hrawi,
who is trying to end 15 years of civil war. An official in Hrawi's
administration said Syrian and Lebanese government troops would
attack if a French mediation attempt failed, but he did not set a
deadline.
   Hrawi's army was ordered on maximum alert, and his troops joined
the Syrian army in positions facing Aoun's lines along a five-mile
front from south Beirut to the central mountains east of the
capital.
   Aoun urged the estimated 150,000 inhabitants of his enclave to
form a human shield around his headquarters at the heavily damaged
presidential palace.
   He employed the same tactic last year to prevent a Syrian
assault. The move caused an uproar, and France and the Vatican
pressured Syrian President Hafez Assad to call off the assault.
   Hrawi's government ordered the latest blockade of Aoun's enclave
as of Sept. 30 in a bid to force the general to step down.
   Jeeps from Aoun's military toured towns and villages of the
enclave today, and soldiers using bullhorns urged the population to
``take up arms and defend yourselves against the aggressors.''
   Aoun's radio blared martial music and songs declaring support
for the 55-year-old general.
   ``We shall stay put whatever they do. We shall not walk out on
Aoun. We don't accept any other leader,'' one of the songs said.
   Church bells tolled to signal thousands of Aoun supporters, who
clapped, shouted slogans and waved banners around Aoun's
headquarters at the shell-wrecked palace.
   They cheered when Aoun emerged from his underground bunker to
address them.
   ``I salute your steadfastness. You will be mentioned in history
books,'' he told the crowd. They are coming to assassinate me, but
I am not afraid. I will be more than delighted to fight them off,''
Aoun said in remarks broadcast live by his radio station.
   Aoun was army commander when former President Amin Gemayel, at
the end of a six-year term, appointed him caretaker prime minister
in September 1988.
   Aoun rejected Hrawi's Syrian-backed election on Nov. 24, 1989.
   The election was held to carry out an Arab League-brokered peace
accord distributing power equally between Moslems and Christians as
a step toward ending Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war.
   Aoun and Hrawi are both Maronite Catholics, the Christian sect
that dominated Lebanon for decades after independence from France
in 1943. But the general considers the president to be a Syrian
puppet.
   Syria, now the main power broker in Lebanon, has 40,000 troops
deployed in predominantly Moslem regions under a 1976 peacekeeping
mandate from the 21-nation Arab League.

   Nashville Mayor Bill Boner has been so diverted
by his romance with aspiring country singer Traci Peel that he
isn't doing his job, talk show host Phil Donahue says.
   ``You are very close to giving the finger to the city,'' Donahue
said during a taping of ``Donahue'' Thursday. ``You're a distracted
mayor. You were an out-of-the-closet adulterer.''
   Peel and Boner made national headlines during their reported
summer romance while the mayor was still married to his third wife,
Betty. Boner married Peel on Oct. 1, three days after his divorce
was final.
   Boner said he has accomplished much during his three-year term.
   ``I've brought more money into Nashville than anybody else,''
Boner said. ``We lived up to our commitments. We have a totally
integrated solid-waste management system.''
   Peel sang ``Rocky Top'' during the show, accompanied by Boner on
the harmonica.

   WATERVILLE, Maine (AP) - Syndicated columnist David S. Broder of
The Washington Post is this year's recipient of the Elijah Parish
Lovejoy award, Colby College officials said.
   Broder, winner of the 1973 Pulitzer Prize for distinguished
commentary, will be honored as the 38th Lovejoy fellow in a Nov. 16
ceremony at Colby's Waterville campus. He will receive an honorary
doctor of laws degree and deliver the annual Lovejoy lecture.
   The award is presented annually in memory of the Colby alumnus
who is considered America's first martyr in the struggle to protect
press freedoms. Lovejoy was killed in 1837 trying to defend his
abolitionist newspaper from a pro-slavery mob.
   Broder, picked by a panel of journalists and college officials,
has written four books on American politics. He also writes a
semiweekly column that appears in more than 300 newspapers.

   An Iraqi opposition group based in London
said today that Iraq is considering withdrawing from Kuwait and
that its ruling political party has circulated a questionnaire
asking key members for their opinion.
   The Kurdistan Democratic Party-Iraq said President Saddam
Hussein might use the survey as a way of justifying a withdrawal
from Kuwait.
   The Kurdistan party said in a news release received in Nicosia
from its London headquarters that the questionnaire was circulated
on Oct. 8 to senior Arab Baath Socialist Party members, cadres and
activists.
   ``This latest move shows building tension and anxiety within the
Iraqi leadership over the consequences of its invasion and
annexation of Kuwait,'' the Kurdistan party said in its statement.
   ``It may well indicate that Saddam Hussein is contemplating a
way out of the crisis by consulting party members,'' it said.
   ``The regime's propaganda can point back to party approval for a
withdrawal ... in order to show a popular backing for any eventual
decision taken by Saddam Hussein to seek a compromise in the
current crisis.''
   The three survey questions reportedly posed were:
   -Should Iraq remain in Kuwait?
   -Should Iraq withdraw from Kuwait?
   -Should Iraq stay in Kuwait even if war broke out?
   Those surveyed were allowed to answer under condition of
anonymity, according to the Kurdish opposition group.
   The purported survey could not be independently confirmed.
   However, the Kurdistan Democratic Party-Iraq is known to have
good access to information inside Iraq. And the group was the first
source to report on the use of chemical weapons against the Kurdish
population in Iraq in 1988.
   If such a questionnaire was distributed, it would represent an
unusual attempt by Saddam to rule by consensus rather than decree.
   The Iraqi leader is known for his obsessive grasp on power in
all political and military matters, as well as his tight control
over the nationalist Baath Party, which served as his springboard
to power.
   The Kurdistan Democratic Party seeks Saddam's overthrow and
establishment of an independent Kurdish state in northeast Iraq.
   Saddam used chemical weapons in suppressing an April 1988
Kurdish uprising in the city of Halabja in which an estimated
20,000 ethnic Kurds were killed.
   There are also Kurdish groups in Iran and Turkey who seek
independence.
   Iraq invaded oil-rich Kuwait on Aug. 2, prompting the deployment
of a multinational force led by the United States in Saudi Arabia
and the Persian Gulf. The force is upholding a trade embargo
approved by the United Nations.
   Saddam annexed Kuwait, claiming it was historically part of
Iraq, and has said repeatedly that Iraq would never withdraw.

<HEAD>Gallup Poll: College Students Borrow Too Much</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<HEAD>AP Education Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans say students must borrow too much
money to attend college, but agree a college education is worth a
lot over an entire lifetime, a Gallup Organization poll showed
Friday.
   The survey found adults nationwide think the cost of higher
education is unmanageable without some form of financial
assistance.
   It showed that 91 percent of the 1,014 adults interviewed by
telephone in June believe it is not possible today for most people
to go to college without receiving some form of financial aid.
   Sixty percent believe the loan burden most students bear is too
high. About half as many, 28 percent, said the loan burden is about
right given the value of a college education. Four percent said
students borrow too little.
   ``We must all redouble our efforts to provide the financial
resources needed - grants and other aid as well as loans - for
every qualified student to attend college,'' said Virginia Carter
Smith, interim president of the Council for Advancement and Support
of Education (CASE), which commissioned the survey.
   Students at four-year public colleges are paying an average of
$1,809 for tuition and fees this year, up 7 percent, and those at
two-year public colleges are paying an average of $884, up 5
percent, the College Board said. At four-year and two-year private
colleges, students are paying an average of $9,391 and $5,003,
respectively, up 8 percent.
   Almost half of all college students receive public or private
assistance, which reached an all-time high of $28 billion last
year, the College Board said.
   According to the poll, the public supports changing federal
government policy to include academic promise as a criterion for
financial aid. If the federal government is to give out additional
aid, 66 percent said it should be based on both academic ability
and financial need.
   Twenty percent prefer the current system, which is based solely
on financial need, with about half as many, 11 percent, voicing a
preference for additional aid being based strictly on academic
potential.
   The survey also found that 75 percent believe significant
advancements in the areas of medicine and technology could be
accomplished if more people obtained a college education, and 58
percent feel that more college educated adults would dramatically
improve society's ablity to solve social problems such as crime,
drugs and homelessness.
   CASE, an international association of colleges, universities,
and independent elementary and secondary schools, released the
survey as part of National Higher Education Week, which begins
Sunday. The margin of error was a plus or minus 4 percent.

<HEAD>Police Lift Township Curfew</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police, citing a decline in
factional fighting, on Friday lifted a 9 p.m.-4 a.m. curfew imposed
Sept. 25 in black townships around Johannesburg.
   Police Col. Steve van Rooyen said there had been a sharp drop in
both political violence and ordinary crime since the curfew went
into effect.
   Almost 800 blacks have died in factional fighting in the past
two months, but there have been only scattered incidents in recent
weeks. The main combatants have been supporters of the African
National Congress and Zulus loyal to the conservative Inkatha
movement.
   The ANC and other anti-apartheid groups called the curfew a
violation of civil liberties. But many township residents said the
measure made life safer in black neighborhoods.
   Also, police and church leaders agreed to stop pauper's burials
of some 300 unclaimed corpses from the recent violence. Some 200
victims already have received such burials, in which the deceased
is buried in an unmarked grave by the government.
   Many of those killed were migrant workers whose families live
hundreds of miles away and either did not know of the deaths or
could not afford to travel to Johannesburg.
   In another development, police subpoenaed a journalist to
testify about a report in which he alleged police bias in the
township fighting.
   Linden Birns of Business Day, the country's leading financial
daily, was ordered to appear in court Oct. 22 to answer questions
about his report on police actions of Aug. 13.

   A man who had come to pick up his last

injuring two others before turning the gun on himself, police said.
   Baltimore County Police Sgt. Steve Doarnberger said the
unidentified man fired several shots with a 9mm handgun in the
service department, then killed himself at Fox Chevrolet around
noon.
   ``He was working here until Tuesday, when he left with the
mutual agreement of the (dealership). He came back today and went
into the service bay area ... began to open fire,'' said police
spokesman E. Jay Miller.
   The other dead man was a veteran mechanic, police said. The two
injured men - the general manager of the dealership and the service
manager - were in critical condition at the University of Maryland
Shock Trauma Center, said hospital spokeswoman Rochelle Cohen.
   Employees at the dealership described the gunman as a friendly
co-worker who had worked at the dealership for two years.

   The House today approved a 1991 defense
spending bill that makes wholesale cuts in President Bush's budget
request for strategic weapons programs.
   By a vote of 322-97, the House adopted the $268 billion package
that stops production of the B-2 bomber at 15 planes and slashes
spending on the Strategic Defense Initiative to $2.3 billion.
   The legislation also reduces the number of U.S. troops by
77,000, cuts production funds for the Pentagon's plan to place MX
missiles on railroad cars and restores $403 million for the V-22
Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft.
   Final passage of the bill, which meets the level of defense
spending in the budget resolution approved by Congress last
weekend, came after the House turned aside across-the-board cuts in
the military.

<DATELINE>SALLISAW, kla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An eastern Oklahoma town that once
reviled writer John Steinbeck for his portrayal of the region in
``The Grapes of Wrath'' has named a festival after the classic.
   ``We needed some kind of celebration,'' said Don Elwick, manager
of the the Chamber of Commerce in this community of 6,400 people.
   The Grapes of Wrath festival this weekend will feature souvenir
bags of dust and a costume contest for the best-dressed Depression
victim. There will also be showings of the movie of the book
everyone once hated, though some locals were cast in it.
   ``We weren't the Dust Bowl,'' insists 84-year-old Pauline
Plunkett, who was an extra when ``The Grapes of Wrath'' was filmed
in 1939.
   ``They left the impression that all this area of the country was
just poor, non-working, ornery people,'' Ms. Plunkett said. ``That
wasn't the way it was.''
   When the novel ``The Grapes of Wrath'' was published, Oklahomans
of the era generally objected. It was banned in some places.
   But when the book was made into a movie, Hollywood came to
Sallisaw for background shots, including one 23-second scene of
cars and trucks loaded down with Oklahomans and their belongings in
the exodus to California.
   Ms. Plunkett said she was on her front porch one day when her
husband, Olen, drove up in his pickup and yelled, ``Y'all get your
clothes ready.''
   ``We just hopped in the pickup like we was,'' she said. The next
thing they knew, they were in the movies.
   As the procession of vehicles reached the end of the road for
the shot, the film crew paid passengers through the windows in
silver dollars. Some recall getting $2, some $5, some $7 for
drivers.
   It was a lot of money then. ``We had people here working for 50
cents a day and supporting a family,'' said Bill Lovern, who played
hooky from high school that day.

   Police arrested Randall Maestas, who was on probation from an
earlier robbery. He was being held in the Jefferson County jail
Friday on suspicion of attempted robbery. Authorities said he had a

   Republican resistance to raising top income
tax rates is splintering as Democrats portray the GOP as the party
of the rich.
   ``It is the world of political dynamics in action,'' said Rep.
Steve Gunderson, R-Wis. ``I'm sick and tired of going home to rural
Wisconsin and protecting a Republican image as the party of the
rich.''
   A few months ago, Gunderson, a member of the House GOP
leadership, was one of a majority of congressional Republicans who
pledged in writing not to change tax rates in any circumstance.
   Now, he and others favor a major revamp including raising the
top tax rate on the rich. Some, like Gunderson, would do it in
exchange for a cut in the tax rate on capital gains - profits from
the sale of investments - and others as an alternative to proposed
levies such as a 12 cent increase in gasoline taxes.
   The driving force behind the GOP conversions is evidence that
after years of trying, Democrats are scoring with their us-vs.-them
rhetoric with a public made more receptive by the S&amp;L scandal and a
faltering economy.
   ``It's totally inaccurate and unfair. The Democrats have tried
to turn the debate into a class warfare,'' complained Sen. Richard
Lugar, R-Ind. ``There really is no need to try to turn what is
already a difficult process into a campaign issue.''
   But Democrats are doing just that.
   Democratic members of the House Ways and Means Committee on
Thursday proposed raising income tax rates on the wealthiest
Americans from 28 to 33 percent. In addition, people earning more
than $1 million annually would pay a 10 percent tax surcharge.
   The extra revenue would be used to ease the hit on Medicare
recipients that was proposed by the bipartisan budget summit with
President Bush.
   ``Democrats today embraced a series of changes to restore
fairness to our tax system,'' said committee Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill.
   The Democratic plan clearly was a political statement, veto bait
for the president, an attempt to highlight the issue in the final
weeks before the midterm elections.
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., and other Republicans worried
there may not be enough time to fight back.
   ``Once it's shaped that way, it's awfully hard to get people
focused back,'' she said. Republicans needed to come forward with a
clear position but, she said, ``I think maybe the opportunity for
reason has now been lost.''
   ``This is a policy squabble that has become a public relations
catastrophe,'' said Rep. Fred Grandy, R-Iowa. ``We are in damage
control.''
   ``I wish we were in a big debate over whether we were going to
be freezing spending for a while, instead of raising taxes,'' said
Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., chairman of the Senate Republican
campaign committee. ``For the time being, anyway, we've lost the
debate on the spending side.''
   ``I think so far the Democrats have been pretty successful in
demagoguing the (tax) issue. They're taking advantage of it,''
Nickles said.
   Nickles said Republicans now might support what he called
``making the tax rates more understandable,'' that is, making the
marginal tax rates on the wealthy match those of the upper middle
class, but without a net increase in revenue.
   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis in 1988 tried
but failed to woo voters with his ``I'm on your side'' campaign
theme. Last year, congressional Democrats revived the concept in
their barely successful blockade of Bush's capital gains tax
proposals.
   But a recent national poll by the Times Mirror Center for People
&amp; The Press showed 21 percent of the people think Republicans as
``rich, powerful moneyed interests.'' In a previous poll three
years ago, 18 percent made such an association.
   Earlier, Times Mirror incorrectly reported 51 percent think of
Republicans as rich and powerful and blamed a computer error.
   But coming up with a GOP answer the public can understand is a
tall order.
   House GOP leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., said his ranks were
divided.
   ``There are some who are really worried about the rich man vs.
poor man argument (who would) without too much prodding go to 33
percent,'' the Democratic position, he said.
   Others were still wedded to the capital gains tax cut in line
with Bush's 1988 campaign position, which Democrats charge would
mean a big break for the super-rich, he said.
   The confusion over where the president is now isn't helping,
some say.
   ``We don't know what game we're playing. We don't know who's on
our team,'' said Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn. ``But we're sure the ball
is in play.''

<HEAD>Moscow Man Convicted Of Insulting Jews, Sentenced To Labor Camp</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A court on Friday convicted a Russian nationalist
of fanning ethnic hostility and insulting Jews in a landmark case
that had galvanized fears of anti-Jewish pogroms and fueled a
Jewish exodus from the country.
   American and Soviet Jewish leaders hailed the verdict as the
first real sign of a government crackdown on Russian anti-Semitism.
A lawyer said it was the first time an accused anti-Semite has been
put on trial in Russia.
   The judge sentenced Konstantin Smirnov-Ostashvili, a 54-year-old
factory worker, to two years in a labor camp.
   ``Everything is taken out of context! It's all a lie!'' the
defendant shouted angrily in one of many outbursts during the
half-hour session in the packed and heavily guarded Moscow City
Court.
   Smirnov-Ostashvili, a member of the nationalist group Pamyat,
has denied being anti-Semitic, but maintains that the Soviet
Union's 1.4 million Jews hold a disproportionate number of high
places in government and society.
   He was accused of organizing protesters who broke up a Jan. 18
meeting at the Central House of Literature in Moscow and insulted
Jewish writers. The court determined he was drunk at the time.
   The judge also identified Smirnov-Ostashvili as the protester
whom the weekly magazine Ogonyok quoted as shouting at the writers:
   ``Your time is over. Neither the police, nor the KGB, nor the
party will help you. Now we will be masters of the country and you
newcomers, clear out and go to Israel. How long can we tolerate
your Russophobia?''
   It was the first trial under a year-old law passed to quell
unrest among the Soviet Union's more than 100 ethnic groups. The
law punishes inciting hatred and enmity among ethnic groups.
   Anti-Semitism dates back centuries in Russia, the nation's
largest republic, and has frequently been associated with Russian
nationalism, although it also has reared its head in most of the
other 14 Soviet republics at various times.
   Smirnov-Ostashvili brought up his national heritage repeatedly
Friday.
   ``I'm suffering for Russia!'' the defendant shouted as he stood
behind a brown wooden partition, guarded by five green-uniformed
Interior Ministry soldiers bearing guns and rubber truncheons. He
wore a jacket over a blue track suit and shouted and jabbed his
fist in the air.
   Supporters of Smirnov-Ostashvili, some wearing Pamyat buttons,
heckled the judge as he read a summary of the case and the verdict.
   ``How are your friends in Tel Aviv?'' they shouted.
   Protesters outside held a sign that read, ``The Trial of
Ostashvili is a Trial of the Russian People.''
   Judge Andrei Muratov said the defendant's diatribe at the
writers' meeting was not ``a dialogue or polemics'' but contained
``insulting, demeaning, threatening phrases virtually intended to
humiliate the national honor and dignity of citizens of the Jewish
origin.''
   Smirnov-Ostashvili, the judge said, had tried ``to play one
nationality against another ... Russians to Jews, by accusing one
nationality of illegal actions in respect of another. He was thus
irritating and agitating those present in an attempt to cause
hostility, discord and enmity.''
   The incident and three-month trial have received wide publicity,
and many Soviet Jews have cited the case and other threats from
Russian nationalist groups as a factor in their decision to
emigrate.
   A record 18,725 Jews arrived in Israel from the Soviet Union in
September, and Soviet Jewish groups have said the numbers will
continue to soar because of ``an unprecedented panic among the
Jewish population.''
   In recent months, anti-Jewish graffiti has appeared on
synagogues and the doors of homes where Jews live, and hate-mongers
have openly distributed leaflets that borrow from Hitler to condemn
the ``Zionist menace.''
   Jewish leaders said they saw hope in Friday's court action.
   ``It has shown that there is new fascism in Russia but it has
also shown that Soviet law has been made to work and come to the
rescue,'' said Alla Geller, a member of the writers group and a
trial spectator.
   An American specialist on Soviet Jewry agreed.
   ``It sends a clear message that anti-Semitic acts will not be
tolerated and those who continue to engage in them can expect to
feel the full weight of the law,'' said Myrna Shinbaum. The
director of the New York-based Anti-Defamation League's Soviet
Jewry project spoke during a visit to Moscow.
   Mikhail Chlenov, co-president of Vaad, the Confederation of
Jewish Organizations and Communities in the U.S.S.R., called the
trial a ``first step'' in the crackdown on anti-Semitism.
   He said the government should also investigate Pamyat.
   The court dismissed a charge that Smirnov-Ostashvili beat a
writer at the meeting but upheld an accusation that he threatened
attacks against Jews.
   Smirnov-Ostashvili could have received a maximum penalty of five
years or a fine of up to $8,950. The verdict and sentence were
decided by a judge and two civilian assistants, without a jury.

   Hurricane Lili bore down on North Carolina's Outer Banks with
gale-force winds early today, while remnants of Tropical Storm
Marco moved in from Florida in a squeeze play that unloaded heavy
rain on the South.
   A hurricane warning was posted for parts of the North Carolina
and Virginia coasts, where seas swelled in some areas to 8 feet and
some residents and tourists began to flee. Further south, officials
declared a state of emergency in Augusta, Ga., where flood waters
closed roads and engulfed houses.
   ``All of our roads are flooded,'' said Pam Smith, director of
the Richmond County Emergency Management Agency in Augusta.
``People are trapped in their homes. People are hollering out for
help through their windows. Some are on the rooftops. There are
people in their cars floating down the road.''
   At noon a.m. EDT, Lili was about 400 miles southeast of Cape
Hatteras, N.C., moving west at near 18 mph with winds near 75 mph.
Earlier, the hurricane brought rain, thunderstorms and wind gusts
to Bermuda.
   It was expected to veer northwest and then north.
   ``If it's going to hit land, it's going to hit tomorrow
morning,'' said Daniel Petersen, meteorologist at the National
Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
   ``But it's definitely too early to say, especially if it turns
to the north, then you're paralleling the whole East Coast - and at
that point it turns into a high-tech guessing game,'' Petersen said
early today.
   A hurricane warning was in effect from northeast of Topsail
Beach, N.C., to Virginia Beach, Va. A hurricane watch was extended
from north of Virginia Beach to Cape Henlopen, Del., including
Chesapeake Bay, and from Topsail Beach southward to Littl River
Inlet, S.C.
   Remnants of Marco, which brought 65 mph wind and 5 inches of
rain to Florida's Gulf Coast on Thursday before it broke up, dumped
heavy rain early today in Georgia. Overflowed creeks put roads
under 6 feet of water, and more than 40 people were forced to
evacuate in eastern Georgia's Richmond County.
   The storm was expected to move through western North Carolina
today.
   The entire East Coast could see severe weather as the storms
converge, forecasters said.
   ``There's not only Marco, but Hurricane Lili, a cold front ...
all converging on the East Coast in the next few days,'' said Bob
Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables,
Fla. ``All the weather conditions that these are creating can
produce heavy rain over the East Coast and that's of some
concern.''
   On the Outer Banks, hundreds of Ocracoke Island tourists boarded
ferries for the mainland today.
   ``There've been a lot of campers coming off,'' said Laura Peele,
receptionist at the Hatteras-Ocracoke ferry office. ``The people
who were staying at the Park Service campground and motels, they're
trying to get out.''
   Some of the island's 700 year-round residents also were leaving
the narrow barrier island.
   ``My wife and two kids I've sent away,'' said Bob Touhey, owner
of Ocracoke's Island Inn. ``I'll board up and put things away.''
   Rain from remnants of Tropical Storm Klaus was blamed for at
least five deaths Wednesday in the Carolinas and a train derailment
that spilled 3,000 gallons of diesel fuel but caused no injuries.
   Three people, including two children, were killed when they were
trapped in a stalled car by a surge of water after a dam collapsed
in Kershaw County, S.C. Another child was missing and presumed
dead. Two men were killed in traffic accidents in North Carolina.
   Nearly a foot of rain fell within 24 hours by Thursday in parts
of South Carolina. Sumter County received more than 15 inches of
rain since Wednesday.
   ``Rainfall like that does not occur more than once in every 100
years. There are certainly some areas where it was a 100-year
event,'' said state climatologist John Purvis.
   In eastern Georgia, police said flooding caused three drowning
deaths. In Columbia County, Guy Keller Dean Jr., 49, of Evans,
drowned after he was swept away by flood waters as he tried to
leave his car and make his way to higher ground, said Coroner
Thomas King.
   In Jefferson County, a man was killed on Georgia Highway 4 eight
miles south of Louisville when when his car hit high water and went
out of control. Authorities said another body was discovered on a
county road road in Wrens.
   In Brantley County, Ga., the sheriff's department said a tornado
apparently touched down late Thursday night in an area along the
Satilla River. Deputy Lamar Depratter said some weekend fishing
cabins were damaged, but no injuries were reported.
   In Augusta, Ms. Smith said emergency officials used boats to
evacuate some residents and called for citizens with
four-wheel-drive vehicles to assist in rescue efforts.
   The water pressure blew covers off manholes, and several dive
teams were brought in to assist people stranded in the flood waters
along the highways, Ms. Smith said. A two-mile stretch of
Interstate 20 near Augusta was among the roads that were closed.
   Public schools in Augusta were closed, as were city and county
offices and some businesses.
   ``We got so much rain, so fast in such a short amount of time,''
Ms. Smith said. ``We've never had anything like this.''

   A French news magazine reported today that U.S.
military officials have drawn up plans to free Kuwait and defeat
Iraq in a four-day offensive that would leave Saddam Hussein's
armed forces in ruins.
   L'Express said it obtained an outline of Operation Night Camel
from an unidentified adviser to Defense Secretary Richard Cheney.
The weekly is a general news magazine and has one of the largest
circulations in France.
   The Pentagon declined to comment on the report. ``We have
nothing for you on that,'' Capt. Sam Grizzle, a Pentagon spokesman,
said in Washington.
   The attack would begin on a moonless November night with an air
assault by American warplanes dispatched from Turkey, Saudi Arabia
and the aircraft carrier Independence, the magazine said.
   The planes, including B-52s with cruise missiles, would attempt
to destroy Iraq's air power, neutralizing radar systems, bombing
missile bases and attacking air bases before Iraqi planes could
counterattack, L'Express said.
   ``By dawn, Iraq has lost all capacity to react,'' it said.
``This first phase would have lasted less than six hours.''
   In the second phase, L'Express said, warplanes and missiles
would be used to ``annihilate'' Iraq's entire military industrial
complex. Targets would include nuclear facilities, chemical weapon
depots, arms factories, command bunkers and the main highway to
Kuwait.
   Also during this phase, an air attack would be mounted on Iraqi
tank units massed near the border with Saudi Arabia, L'Express
said.
   The magazine said the goal of the third phase would be to cut
off links between Kuwait and Iraq. It said U.S. Green Berets and
Navy commandos would infiltrate behind Iraqi lines to disrupt
communications.
   Then, it said, the multinational force would launch an offensive
along the Iraqi-Kuwait border involving tank-killer planes, combat
helicopters and 200 U.S. M-1 tanks. This would be aimed at cutting
off the 170,000 Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait from supplies and
reinforcements in Iraq.
   The fourth and final phase, according to L'Express, would be an
even larger offensive to reconquer Kuwait. It said 11,000 U.S.
Marines would land on Kuwait's north coast, while 45,000 Marines,
three mechanized U.S. Army infantry battalions, 4,000 French
troops, 6,000 British troops and 50,000 soldiers from the pan-Arab
force would cross into Kuwait from the south to ``liberate it meter
by meter.''
   L'Express said U.S. planners estimated the offensive might cost
20,000 American lives. It gave no estimate for dead of other
nations.
   The magazine said planners had two other reservations - that
Iraq might retaliate with chemical weapons, and that it might
succeed in wrecking Saudi Arabian oil fields.

   A French news magazine reported today the U.S. military has
drawn up plans to free Kuwait and defeat Iraq in an attack next
month, but a group of Iraqi exiles says Saddam Hussein is already
considering withdrawing from Kuwait.
   In another development, a jetliner carrying 272 evacuees from
Kuwait and Iraq, almost all Americans, left London today for the
United States, the last leg of the first U.S.-chartered flight from
Iraq in nearly three weeks.
   Also today, Germany and Belgium said their last diplomats have
left Kuwait, leaving only the U.S. and three other Western missions
open there.
   In other developments:
   -Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan was greeted by hoots and
catcalls today when he opened a special session of parliament by
urging support for his plan to deploy Japan's Self Defense Forces
overseas for the first time. Lawmakers are deeply divided over
whether to create the force.
   -Saddam told Iraqi children that President Bush and the U.N.
embargo on Iraq have deprived them of milk and sweets, but urged
them to do without candy to maintain their pride and dignity. The
speech, marking Iraqi Children's Day, was read by an announcer on
Baghdad radio and television.
   -Assailants shot and killed Egypt's parliament speaker, Rifaat
el-Mahgoub, outside a Cairo hotel, police and witnesses said. The
attack came after Egypt's interior minister warned of possible
terrorist reprisals for Egypt's stand against Iraq in the gulf
crisis. No one claimed responsibility for the killing.
   The French news magazine, L'Express, said the plan drawn up by
the U.S. military officials calls for a four-day offensive in
November that would leave Saddam's armed forces in ruins.
   L'Express said it obtained an outline of the plan from an
unidentified adviser to U.S. Defense Secretary Richard Cheney.
   U.S. planners estimated the offensive might cost 20,000 American
lives, the magazine said. It gave no estimate for dead of other
nations.
   The Pentagon declined to comment on the report. ``We have
nothing for you on that,'' Capt. Sam Grizzle, a Pentagon spokesman,
said in Washington.
   The Iraqi opposition group, the Kurdistan Democratic Party-Iraq,
said that Iraq is considering withdrawing from Kuwait and that its
ruling political party has circulated a questionnaire asking key
members for their opinion.
   The group said President Saddam Hussein might use the survey as
a way of justifying a withdrawal from Kuwait.
   The Kurdistan party said in a news rlease received in Nicosia
from its London headquarters that the questionnaire was circulated
on Oct. 8 to senior Arab Baath Socialist Party members, cadres and
activists.
   The purported survey could not be independently confirmed.
   However, the Kurdistan Democratic Party-Iraq is known to have
good access to information inside Iraq. And the group was the first
source to report on the use of chemical weapons against the Kurdish
population in Iraq in 1988.
   In London, a U.S. Embassy spokeswoman said the chartered Pan Am
jetliner plane carrying 272 people left at 1:59 p.m. (9:59 a.m.
EDT) and would land at Raleigh-Durham International Airport in
North Carolina about 7{ hours later.
   A group of 321 Americans and other Western evacuees from Iraq
landed near London on Thursday in the first such flight in nearly
three weeks.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said in
Washington on Thursday that U.S. officials have received reports
that Iraqi authorities are now barring American men 55 years and
older from leaving Iraq and Kuwait.
   She said previous indications were that American males of that
age and those under 18 were allowed to leave.
   Recent State Department estimates indicated more than 600
Americans were stranded in Kuwait and more than 300 in Iraq. Some
are being held at strategic Iraqi installations to deter possible
attack.
   In Bonn, Germany, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said the last
diplomats in the German Embassy drove from Kuwait to Baghdad on
Thursday. ZDF television, a German station, said the group included
the ambassador and his wife, along with three embassy staff
members.
   The Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said they finally left the embassy because of exhausted
food supplies.
   Belgian officials in Brussels said their remaining two diplomats
also left for Baghdad on Thursday.
   That leaves the Americans, British, Canadians and French as the
only holdouts among Western missions.

   Fifteen armed men stole artworks from Colombian
artist Fernando Botero's ranch outside Bogota after entering his
home intending to kidnap him, the artist said.
   Botero, 52, was in New York on Thursday when the theft occurred.
He said in an interview that he believed the robbers ``went in to
my ranch to kidnap me. I will not go back to Colombia as long as
the situation of danger in my country persists.''
   Botero, a painter and sculptor known for his distinctively
rotund figures, said the attackers, ``armed with all types of
weapons,'' went in to the ranch at around six in the morning and
killed two dogs.
   The intruders also tied up the family taking care of the ranch,
including several children, Botero said.
   ``They went into a vault after cutting through a 5-inch metal
door,'' he said. ``They spent all day doing that.''
   The robbers took 17 paintings and three sculptures ``of great
sentimental value'' to the artist, he said. Botero did not
speculate on who was responsible for the crime and said he had no
idea why anyone would want to kidnap him.
   Botero said his housekeepers were unharmed when neighbors found
them the evening of the heist. Colombian federal police were
investigating the break-in, he said.

   An officer was reprimanded after a
suspect's tooth, knocked out in a scuffle, was placed on a wall at
the police station as a trophy, authorities said.
   Police Chief Sid Klein reprimanded Sgt. William Goatcher, head
of a police tactical unit, on Wednesday for allowing another office
to display the tooth in public for two months.
   The chief said the display exhibited ``a clear lack of
sensitivity to the feelings of others.''
   Klein cleared unit members of charges they used excessive force
in arresting the suspect, Henry Charles Bailey, on July 19. But the
chief ordered the unit to attend a sensitivity training session.
   Bailey is still being held in the Pinellas County jail on
charges of selling cocaine and committing battery on a police
officer.

<HEAD>Proposed Apartment Project Would Use 38-Year-Old Plans By Frank
Lloyd Wright</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An architect has proposed building a 12-story
luxury apartment tower using plans prepared and then abandoned by
Frank Lloyd Wright 38 years ago.
   Architect Louis Astorino told city officials he wanted to build
the trangular tower on the edge of Mount Washington, a cliff
overlooking downtown and the Monongahela River.
   The building would have 12 large apartments, one on each floor,
that would cost $1 million to $1.2 million each. It would be built
on the site of the closed St. Mary of the Mount High School.
   City officials have welcomed the plan.
   ``I think it's an exciting, wonderful thing,'' said City
Councilwoman Michelle Madoff. ``People would be living in a work of
art.''
   Astorino said he would not discuss the project until after
presenting the plans to St. Mary's parishioners Sunday.
   The school was closed because of declining enrollment in June
1982. There were no takers when the 1.3-acre site went on the
market for $2 million the following year.
   Wright, who died in 1959, was considered America's greatest
architect by many. There are more than 400 Wright-designed homes in
the United States.
   Wright conceived the project in 1952, calling it ``Point View
Residences.'' It was commissioned by Pittsburgh department store
magnate Edgar J. Kaufmann.
   It wasn't built because developers at the time thought Mount
Washington lacked the shops and services needed by the building's
future residents, according to ``Treasures of Taliesin,'' a 1985
book by Wright archivist Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer.
   Wright's design calls for a triangular tower that would give
each unit terraces and balconies facing in all three directions.
   The building would have eight stories above street level and
four descending Mount Washington's face.

   Students and other olunteers whipped up
a batch of 24,000 cookies to show U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia that
they're not forgotton.
   The Middletown chapter of the American Business Women's
Association organized Thursday's baking project, ``Operation We
Care.'' About 60 adult volunteers and a dozen students from a
commercial food services class participated.
   The cookies were baked at the Manchester Technical Center, then
bagged and packed in boxes, along with donated items like combs,
sunscreen lotion, deodorant, gum and games, and poems and letters
written by schoolchildren.
   Helen Dutch, whose husband, son and son-in-law are all
servicemen, originated the We Care project. She said she was moved
by the children's letters.
   ``I have been bawling and bawling. This has been overwhelming,''
Mrs. Dutch said.
   The boxes will be driven to Mechanicsburg, Pa., then loaded on a
military transport for the flight to Saudi Arabia.

<HEAD>Biggest Gas Price Hike Sends Wholesale Prices Soaring</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Wholesale prices soared 1.6 percent in
September - an annual rate of more than 20 percent - as gasoline
prices shot up at their fastest pace on record, the government said
Friday.
   ``The oil shock is hitting with a vengeance. ... It's just one
more jolt to an already fragile economy,'' said Robert Dederick,
chief economist at the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.
   ``This is the start of the wave of double-digit inflation we
will have to suffer through for the next quarter or two because of
Iraq,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Co. ``It's
going to propel an economy that's already in recession into a
deeper recession.''
   While the Labor Department blamed much of the steep increase in
wholesale costs one step short of the retail level on costlier
petroleum, prices excluding the volatile energy and food areas were
still up a worrisome 0.6 percent - twice the August gain.
   The 20.6 percent rise in the cost of gasoline was the highest
one-month increase since the government began tracking the
commodity in 1947.
   At the earliest stage of the production process, crude oil
prices rose 20.4 percent, fueling analysts' concern that the higher
prices will begin affecting the thousands of plastic, chemical and
other products made with petroleum.
   Oil also shows up in utility costs and figures in prices for
products that must be transported long distances.
   In a separate report, the Commerce Department said retail sales
jumped 1.1 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted $151.2
billion, and were bolstered by the soaring cost of gasoline and a
partial recovery in auto sales. Excluding gasoline, sales rose 0.8
percent.
   Analysts say the combination of higher prices and stronger
consumer spending deepens the dilemma for the Federal Reserve,
which has been under pressure from the Bush administration to ease
its inflation-fighting campaign and lower interest rates to spur
the economy.
   ``How in the world can the Fed ease? The consumer at least
hasn't rolled over and inflation is rebelling. The two (reports)
give a further reason for the Fed to remain frozen in its current
posture,'' Dederick said.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``Inflation
going up is never good news.'' He declined to criticize the Federal
Reserve's apparent tight monetary policy.
   ``We still are concerned about growth and about preventing a
recession. We think the Fed has recognized all these factors and is
on the right course,'' Fitzwater said.
   September's 1.6 percent rise in wholesale prices would translate
into an annual increase of 20.9 percent if prices rose at the same
pace for 12 straight months, the government said.
   Before Iraq occupied Kuwait Aug. 2, wholesale prices were rising
at an annual rate of just 3 percent. But with the August and
September increases figured in, wholesale inflation has increased
at an annual rate of 6.3 percent so far in 1990, the government
said.
   Last month's rise in the Producer Price Index for finished goods
followed a 1.3 percent increase in August, also caused by higher
energy costs brought on by the gulf crisis.
   It was the biggest two-month jump in wholesale prices since
1980, the government said.
   Prices at earlier stages of the production process were up
sharply, too. Crude-goods costs jumped 4.6 percent while
intermediate-goods prices rose 1.8 percent.
   An example of the three processing stages would be cotton at the
crude-goods level, cloth at the intermediate-goods level and
clothing at the finished-goods level.
   At the finished-goods level:
   -Energy costs overall rose 13.8 percent. Fuel oil prices rose
21.3 percent. Natural gas costs were up 1.3 percent.
   -Food prices were down 0.9 percent after rising 0.8 percent in
August.
   -Passenger car prices were up a sharp 3.4 percent after rising
0.8 percent.
   The Consumer Price Index, which measures the prices of goods and
services at the retail level, is due out next week.
   The various changes put the Producer Price Index for all
finished goods at 120.3 in September. That means a hypothetical
selection of goods that cost $100 in 1982 would have cost $120.30
last month, up from $113.60 a year earlier.

<HEAD>Wilson Has Narrow Lead in Poll</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Sen. Pete Wilson holds a narrow
lead of 47 percent to 42 percent over Democrat Dianne Feinstein in
the race for governor, according to a California Poll published
Friday.
   Although the results were too close to declare Wilson a clear
leader, the survey respondents by a 2-1 margin said they expected
the Republican nominee to win the Nov. 6 election.
   Asked who they expected to win, regardless of their personal
preference, 55 percent named Wilson and 27 percent said Feinstein,
said pollster Mervin Field.
   ``Wilson voters are supremely confident that he will be elected.
While a plurality of Feinstein voters believe she will be
California's next governor, their confidence level is not as
high,'' Field said.
   Some 1,021 voters were surveyed by telephone in the Oct. 3-10
poll, which had a margin of error of 3.2 percentage points. Seven
percent were undecided, and 4 percent favored minor party
candidates.
   Wilson had leads of 45 percent to 42 percent in an August survey
and 45 percent to 40 percent in a June survey.
   In the latest survey, Wilson was leading by 49 percent to 41
percent among men and by 46 percent to 44 percent among women. The
survey found Wilson leading by a 50-39 margin in Southern
California while Feinstein led by a 48-43 margin in Northern
California.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Reinstate California Campaign Limits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Friday refused to
reinstate campaign-contribution limits for California's
gubernatorial election and other political contests in that state
next month.
   The court, without comment or recorded dissent, let stand a
federal judge's ruling that threw out contribution limits imposed
by California voters in Proposition 73 two years ago.
   The judge's ruling lets candidates for governor, other statewide
posts and some local offices accept contributions greater than the
limits created in 1988.
   U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton ruled on Sept. 25 that the
limits gave an unfair advantage to incumbents. Karlton also tossed
out a ban on transfers of funds between candidates.
   Prop 73 barred anyone from contributing more than $1,000 to a
particular candidate in a fiscal year. The measure also limited
political action committee donations to $2,500 or $5,000 per
candidate for each fiscal year, depending on the size of the
committee.
   Wilson, who had only token opposition in the June primary,
raised $12.5 million through June and had $3.9 million in the bank
as of July 1. Feinstein raised $8.1 million through June but had
just $645,344 left over from her victorious primary campaign
against state Attorney General John Van de Kamp.
   The contribution limits were challenged by the Democratic Party
and labor unions, which said Proposition 73 unfairly interfered
with free-speech rights and the freedom of association.

   Republican Arliss Sturgulewski and Democra
Tony Knowles are running virtually even in the governor's race,
with third-party candidate Wally Hickel close behind, according to
a statewide poll.
   The poll, commissioned for the Anchorage Daily News and
Anchorage radio station KENI, showed 34 percent of the respondents
favored Sturgulewski, 29 percent backed Knowles and 25 percent
preferred Hickel.
   The percentage spreads between Sturgulewski and Knowles and
between Knowles and Hickel were within the survey's 5 percentage
point margin of error.
   The random telephone survey of 525 Alaskans was conducted Monday
through Wednesday by Dittman Research Corp. of Alaska.
   The survey showed sharp differences in candidate preferences
based on sex and region.
   Sturgulewski was favored by 40 percent of the women surveyed,
but only 28 percent of the men. Hickel had more support among men
than women and Knowles had equal support among the sexes.
   Knowles, whose running mate is Native leader Willie Hensley, was
preferred by just over half the voters in rural Alaska. Hickel led
in Fairbanks and the Interior, where he was the choice of just
under half the voters.
   Sturgulewski, a state senator from Anchorage running with
businessman Jim Campbell, has the strongest support in Southeast
Alaska and Anchorage, the poll indicates.

<HEAD>Iranian Nabbed on Palace Lawn With Gift for Princess Diana</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iranian trying to give Princess Diana a silver
clock because he admired her climbed over two fences and through
rose bushes before being nabbed on the lawn of her Kensington
Palace home, police said Friday.
   The princess was home at the time of Ali Kashabi's entry into
the grounds of the palace shortly before midnight Thursday but was
``not disturbed'' by the incident, said a Buckingham Palace
spokeswoman.
   Kashabi said it was the second time he had been arrested in the
Kensington Palace area in as many days. He said he was arrested for
drunkenness on Wednesday night but was released.
   Kashabi told Horseferry Magistrate's Court that he decided to
give Princess Diana the silver clock after writing several letters
to her but receiving no reply.
   ``I just wanted to see Lady Diana. I think that she is a very
beautiful lady and I admire her,'' he said.
   ``They told me I was lucky that I wasn't shot. ... It was a
frightening experience.''
   Police said Kashabi, who gave his address only as California,
was caught on the palace lawn after scaling two fences and walking
through some rose bushes.
   He pleaded guilty to breaching the peace and was told to keep
out of trouble for a year or he would be fined $200. He was not,
however, fined Friday or given a jail sentence.
   The incident occurred despite the spending of millions of
dollars on security at royal palaces after a man broke into Queen
Elizabeth II's bedroom at Buckingham Palace in 1982 and sat on her
bed chatting with her for more than a half-hour.
   Since then, other security breaches have occurred, including in
February 1987 when a masked man with a hammer and a knife was
arrested after a violent struggle close to the private grounds of
Kensington Palace.
   Kensington Palace in west London is home to 14 other members of
the royal family, including Queen Elizabeth's sister Princess
Margaret.

<TEXT>
   Demonstrators at the Capitol marked Friday's
anniversary of Columbus' discovery of the New World by beginning a
fast to protest what they said were violations of Indian rights.
   A group called Fast for Big Mountain said six people would
engage in a water-only fast on the Capitol steps until Nov. 22,
Thanksgiving Day. With the 150 demonstrators were four Indians
beating a drum.
   ``Columbus, and the conquistadors who followed him, invaded this
hemisphere and exploited, oppressed and killed the original people
here,'' their statement began.
   ``Nearly 500 years later descendants of these indigenous
inhabitants are still being exploited, oppressed and killed by
descendants of the invaders.''
   Columbus first sighted American land on Oct. 12, 1492. In this
country the anniversary was celebrated last Monday.
   The demonstrators cited particularly displacement of Indians on
Big Mountain in Arizona, which they said would help a mining
operation owned by a British firm.
   Ron Greenfield, vice-president of Peabody Holding Co., said in
an interview that the company has had mines in the Black Mesa area
since the 1970s and does not plan an expansion. Ninety percent of
its 870 employees at the mines are Indian, he added.
   Peabody is America's biggest coal mining operation, producing
86.7 million tons last year. It was bought in July by Hanson
Industries, the U.S. subsidiary of a British company.

   The search for alien civilizations in space
expanded to cover the entire sky as a new radio receiver started
running in Argentina on Friday, the anniversary of Columbus'
discovery of the new world.
   ``Today represents the opening up of half of the universe to the
search by the human species for extraterrestrial intelligence,''
said astronomer Carl Sagan, president of the Planetary Society.
   ``You have to be made of wood not to be interested in knowing
whether we're alone in the universe,'' Sagan said by phone from
Ithaca, N.Y., where he is a professor at Cornell University. ``Here
we are for the first time in human history when it's technically
possible to find out. And it's very cheap.
   ``Wouldn't we be ashamed of ourselves if the answer was there
for the taking and we were too shy to look?''
   The Pasadena-based Planetary Society, which advocates space
exploration, financed the supercomputer-controlled radio receiver
and signal analyzer with $150,000 raised from its 125,000 members
in more than 100 nations.
   The 8.4-million-channel receiver, about the size of two large
refrigerators, is called Megachannel Extraterrestrial Assay II, or
META II. It is located at Argentina's Institute of Radioastronomy,
30 miles southeast of Buenos Aires.
   It is identical to META I at Harvard University's Oak Ridge
Observatory in Massachusetts. Since 1985, that receiver has
listened to Northern Hemisphere skies for signals from aliens.
   Steven Spielberg, who directed the films ``E.T., the
Extra-Terrestrial'' and ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind,''
donated $100,000 for META I.
   The META project is the world's most powerful operating search
for alien radio signals, although nothing has been heard so far.
   About 100 people watched as the institute's director, Raul
Colomb, pointed one of the institute's 98-foot-wide radiotelescope
dish antennas toward the Southern Cross, a major Southern
Hemisphere constellation, as the receiver was switched on Friday
morning.
   The new receiver is capable of listening to the heart of our
Milky Way galaxy.
   If either receiver ever detects radio signals intentionally sent
by aliens, it means ``that it's not inevitable civilizations in
their technological adolescence destroy themselves,'' Sagan said.
   The United States celebrated Columbus Day on Monday, but Friday
was the anniversary of Christopher Columbus' arrival in North
America from Spain on Oct. 12, 1492.
   Sagan, who was host of the popular public television series
``Cosmos,'' said discovery of extraterrestrials ``would be still
more powerful and significant and historical. It would be a turning
point in the history of civilization. Every field of human endeavor
will gain something.
   ``The development of technical civilization is likely to happen
on countless other worlds,'' Sagan said. Our galaxy alone contains
400 billion stars, evidence suggests many have planets, and studies
show carbon - the basis of life - is abundant in space, he said.
   More than 50 limited searches for extraterrestrial intelligence
have been conducted since the 1960s. Almost all previous efforts
listened for radio signals above Earth's Northern Hemisphere, with
only brief searches of southern skies.
   The META receivers, designed by Harvard's Paul Horowitz, listen
to radio frequencies around what scientists call the ``water
hole.'' They are frequencies emitted naturally by the breakdown
products of water: hydrogen, the most abundant element in the
universe, and hydroxyl, made of one oxygen and one hydrogen atom.
Water has one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms.
   Astronomers believe that like animals gathering to drink,
intelligent aliens would pick the ``water hole'' as a way to
contact other civilizations.

<HEAD>Consumer Commission Moves To Ban Baby Bean Bags</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS phone number in 7th graf, Recall instructions</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said
Friday it has taken the first step to ban infant ``bean bag''
cushions because of 30 reported cases of babies found dead on them.
   The commission voted Thursday to publish a notice of proposed
rule making in which it will seek public comments to help it
develop an accurate definition of the product.
   The cushions are filled with plastic foam beads or other
granular material that can conform to the body of an infant,
especially to the face, when the infant is placed stomach-downward.
   They have been promoted as resting or sleeping places for
infants or devices to prop them upright, but in at least 30 cases
have led to death through suffocation.
   The commission announced earlier this year an agreement with all
known manufacturers of the cushions to recall them and not produce
any more. The recalls, covering about a million cushions, are still
in effect.
   Consumers who have not already returned their infant cushions
should stop using them, return to the store or destroy them, the
commission said.
   Recall instructions can be obtained from a toll-free telephone
number, 1-800-638-2772. Most manufacturers have offered refunds.
   Commenting on the commission's vote, Chairman Jacqueline
Jones-Smith said, ``Although production of infant cushions has
stopped, we need to prevent any future production of this product
in order to prevent more deaths.''

   Hundreds of Kuwaitis representing
all walks of life began gathering here Friday for a conference on
their country's current plight and its future.
   The exiled emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, will address the
three-day Kuwaiti People's Conference, which begins Saturday.
   His Kuwaiti critics hope the royal family will loosen its hold
on the emirate's financial and political institutions if it regains
control.
   The emir has called for a new social covenant between the
al-Sabah family and Kuwait's citizens.
   The debate has raised questions about the mandate of other gulf
rulers, benevolent despots who so far have rejected a multiparty
system and participatory democracy as destablilizing influences.
   The Iraqi invasion and the popular support Saddam has garnered
in parts of the Arab world have demonstrated the vulnerability of
all the gulf states to destabilizaion by revolutionary populist
forces.
   The Kuwaiti participants at the Jiddah conference include former
ministers, parliamentarians, diplomats, businessmen, judges, civil
servants, journalists and representatives of public and private
organizations.
   Among them are expected to be members of opposition groups, who
had been campaigning for the restoration of Kuwait's Western-style
parliament even before the Aug. 2 invasion.
   The opposition figures insisted even then that they still were
loyal to the emir. In statements over the last few weeks, they have
maintained that line. Some even say they have dropped their
opposition.
   The conference's first session in Jiddah, the Saudi summer
capital, is expected to deal with ways to intensify the opposition
to Saddam's invasion and annexation.
   Conference members also are expected to reject any Iraqi attempt
to include a national referendum on Kuwait's future as part of a
political solution to the gulf crisis.
   ``The very presence of this large number of Kuwaitis is in
itself a pledge of allegiance for the rule of al-Sabah family and
Sheik Jaber,'' said Abdul-Rahman al-Awadi, minister for Cabinet
affairs.
   ``The conference will expose the brutal Iraqi practices against
our people inside Kuwait,'' al-Awadi said.

   Italy's Communist leader, under fire for suggesting
the party change its name and symbol, on Friday proposed a
referendum on his ideas.
   Achille Occhetto said if he lost, he would resign as head of the
West's largest Communist party and the second biggest political
party in Italy after the Christian Democrats.
   Two days earlier, Occhetto suggested the party drop
``Communist'' and call itself the Democratic Party of the Left.
   Old-guard Communists, who have the support of about one-third of
the party members, accused Occhetto of trying to split the
Communists.
   The name-change proposal follows the collapse of communist
regimes throughout Eastern Europe and is aimed at increasing the
party's vote totals, which have been sliding in recent years.
   Occhetto also wants to shrink the party symbol of hammer, sickle
and star and put it at the base of a tree symbolizing liberty,
strong roots and love of nature.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Solomon Mamaloni
resigned Friday from this Pacific archipelago's ruling People's
Alliance Party and said he was forming a new government with
members of the opposition.
   However, the opposition leader said his party would not accept
any appointments to the new Cabinet for this island kingdom of
about 290,000 residents.
   Rank-and-file members of the Alliance Party had been scheduled
to consider a motion of no-confidence in Mamaloni for his role as
parliamentary leader at their annual convention next Saturday.
   Mamaloni announced the surprise move in a statement. He said he
sacked five Cabinet ministers, including his deputy, and replaced
them with opposition members. He also reshuffled the rest of the
Cabinet. The new ministers will be sworn in Monday, he said.
   ``The new government, which is a government for national unity,
is based on proportionate representation of the nation's scattered
provinces - including the capital, Honiara - in terms of population
and resources,'' Mamaloni said.
   He said the new government would ``be guided by the principles
of political reconciliation, national reconstruction and policy
redirection.''
   But opposition leader Andrew Nori said that naming opposition
members to a Mamaloni-led government was out of the question.
   ``The national parliamentary opposition is holding an urgent
meeting in Honiara tomorrow to disassociate itself from any moves
by the prime minister to form a government,'' Nori said.
   The Solomon Islands, discovered in 1568, gained independence in
1978 but remains a member of the British Commonwealth.

<HEAD>Congress Defeats Proposal Allowing States To Close Borders To
Garbage</HEAD>

   New Jersey can breath freely again. It can
still ship its garbage to Indiana.
   A proposal that would have allowed states to close their borders
to other states' garbage was killed in House-Senate negotiations
Friday.
   The garbage fight has pitted New Jersey lawmakers against those
from Indiana, but the issue had far broader ramifications. By some
estimates, as many as two-thirds of the states ship garbage beyond
their borders because of landfill shortages.
   Last month the Senate by a 68-31 vote tacked the interstate
garbage shipment prohibition onto an appropriations bill for the
District of Columbia. But members of a House-Senate conference
committee removed the provision on Friday. The House never enacted
a similar measure.
   ``This is a big win for New Jersey,'' said Sen. Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., who had led the fight against the measure
sponsored by Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind.
   Coats characterized the issue as one giving ``every state the
right to determine its own destiny'' in managing and disposing
trash.
   ``We lost the battle but believe ultimately we will win the
war,'' Coats said through a spokesman. Coats, who has made the
garbage issue a key part of his re-election bid, promised to renew
the fight in the next Congress if re-elected.
   Indiana is among the recipients of a rising tide of out-of-state
garbage. Coats' measure would have allowed states to block garbage
imports or impose high fees on such shipments.
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., said Coats' proposal was an
``attack'' on New Jersey. He and Lautenberg argued that states must
be able to send garbage elsewhere until they can develop
environmentally safe and reasonably priced alternatives including
more incentives for recycling.
   New Jersey, which now sends about half its garbage out of state,
hopes to ease its garbage problems in the future by reaching a goal
of 60 percent recycling.
   Rep. Dean Gallo, R-N.J., who was a member of the conference
committee considering the bill that included the garbage measure,
said House members opposed it because the issue had not been
thoroughly debated in the House.
   Senate negotiators agreed to withdraw the provision after only
three of the six senators at the conference said they would support
it.

   The Arab League will meet next week to
discuss a response to the clash on Jerusalem's Temple Mount in
which at least 19 Palestinians were slain by Israeli police, league
sources said Friday.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization requested the meeting in
the hope Arab countries will issue a joint protest against Monday's
slayings, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The sources said a quorum of 11 members of the 21-member league
had agreed to attend the meeting Wednesday, but refused to identify
them.
   Arab diplomatic sources named nine members who agreed to the
meeting, including the PLO, Iraq, Jordan, Sudan, Yemen, Algeria,
Tunisia, Mauritania and Morocco.
   It was not known whether the members will be represented by
their foreign ministers or their permanent delegates to the league
headquarters in Tunis.
   The diplomatic sources noted most of the Arab countries aligned
against Iraq in the Persian Gulf crisis - including Egypt, Syria
and Saudi Arabia - have not yet responded to the PLO's request for
a meeting.
   The gulf crisis has caused a deep split within the league's
ranks. The PLO has sided with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, whose
forces invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat urged Arab countries on Wednesday to
``make a common front against the butchery against Palestinians by
the forces of Zionist occupation,'' referring to Israel.
   The PLO's 90-member central committee ended three days of talks
Thursday with a demand that the United Nations take measures to
guarantee the protection of Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, PLO spokesman Yasser Abd Rabbo said.
   The PLO and the United States have been at odds over the
contents of a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel
for the Temple Mount slayings. The United States has tried to limit
the mandate of any U.N. team sent to investigate the incident.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Reiterates Refusal to Release Documents</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on Friday
stuck by his decision to block the release of government secrets
that had scuttled the Iran-Contra trial of former CIA agent Joseph
Fernandz.
   The Justice Department's announcement drew a stinging response
from the Iran-Contra special prosecutor.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh said the dismissal of
charges against former CIA agent Joseph Fernandez was forced by an
``overprotective attitude toward classified information.''
   ``No matter how the administration rationalizes the
nonproduction of this information, it shows a lack of concern for
applying the rule of law to officials of the intelligence
community,'' Walsh said.
   He said the administration's stance ``will form the basis for an
important part of our final report'' to Congress on the Iran-Contra
investigation.
   Fernandez, former CIA station chief in Costa Rica, was accused
of lying to the presidential commission that investigated the
Iran-Contra affair and CIA superiors about his role in helping ship
arms to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Fernandez was accused of lying about the purpose of an airstrip
he helped build in Costa Rica that was used by a covert resupply
operation set up by White House aide Oliver L. North.
   A federal judge in Alexandria, Va., last year ruled that
Fernandez was entitled to disclose secrets about CIA operations in
Central America to show it was deeply involved in the covert
resupply effort.
   U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton dismissed the charges
against Fernandez after Thornburgh filed an affidavit under the
Classified Information Procedures Act that barred the use of the
secret evidence.
   In September, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond,
Va., upheld Hilton's determination that Fernandez was entitled to
disclose the secrets at issue during his trial.
   Thornburgh reviewed his original decision. On Friday, the
Justice Department notified Hilton in a letter that Thornburgh
would still not allow the secrets to be released at trial.
   Under CIPA, Hilton's dismissal order does not become final until
the attorney general reaffirms his decision to block the release of
secrets.
   The letter by Justice Department attorney James S. Reynolds said
Thornburgh's review included a meeting with heads of government
agencies responsible for protecting national security.
   These officials unanimously urged Thornburgh not to withdraw his
affidavit, Reynolds said.
   ``The potentially serious damage to national security which
could result from the disclosure of the two categories of
information is exacerbated by the prospect for additional
disclosures at trial,'' Reynolds wrote.
   ``One senior official described the potential harm which could
result as `devastating.'''

<TEXT>
   A news magazine reported Friday that U.S. military
officials have made plans to defeat Iraq and liberate Kuwait in a
four-day offensive that would destroy Saddam Hussein's armed
forces.
   L'Express, a weekly news magazine with one of the largest
circulations in France, said it obtained an outline of the plan
from an unidentified adviser to Defense Secretary Richard Cheney.
   It said U.S. planners estimated the offensive, heavily dependent
on air power, might cost 20,000 American lives. It gave no estimate
for dead of other nations. It said the offensive was to be launched
in November by American warplanes from Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the
aircraft carrier Independence.
   The magazine made no mention of the thousands of Western
hostages held in Iraq and Kuwait at strategic sites.
   A Pentagon spokesman declined comment. ``We have nothing for you
on that,'' said Capt. Sam Grizzle, a Pentagon spokesman.
   Pentagon officials previously have said they would rely on air
power in any attack on Iraq. Air Force Gen. Mike Dugan was fired in
September for public comments about U.S. plans for heavy bombing in
Baghdad that would specifically target Saddam and his family.
   The head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin L. Powell, and
Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. forces in Saudi
Arabia, have said that air power is the only way to defeat Iraqi
forces without overwhelming casualties.
   L'Express said that aside from the high casualties, planners had
two other reservations - that Iraq might retaliate with chemical
weapons, and that Baghdad might succeed in wrecking Saudi Arabian
oil fields.
   The so-called Operation Night Camel would begin on a November
night with an air assault by the American warplanes, including
B-52s with cruise missiles, the magazine said.
   The planes would aim to destroy Iraq's air power before Iraqi
planes could counterattack. Radar systems would be neutralized,
missile bases bombed and air bases attacked, L'Express said.
   The magazine said this first phase would last less than six
hours.
   ``By dawn, Iraq has lost all capacity to react,'' it said.
   In the second phase, warplanes and missiles would be used to
``annihilate'' Iraq's entire military industrial complex, L'Express
said. Targets would include nuclear facilities, chemical weapon
depots, arms factories, command bunkers and the main highway to
Kuwait.
   An air attack would also be mounted on Iraqi tank units massed
near the border with Saudi Arabia in the second phase, L'Express
said.
   In the third phase, the goal would be to cut off links between
Kuwait and Iraq, the magazine said. U.S. Green Berets and Navy
commandos would infiltrate behind Iraqi lines to disrupt
communications.
   The multinational force would then launch an offensive along the
Iraqi-Kuwait border involving tank-killer planes, combat
helicopters and 200 U.S. M-1 tanks to cut off the 170,000 Iraqi
soldiers in Kuwait from supplies and reinforcements, the magazine
said.
   In the fourth and final phase, there would be an even larger
offensive to reconquer Kuwait, L'Express said.
   The magazine said 11,000 U.S. Marines would land on Kuwait's
north coast. At the same time, 45,000 Marines, three mechanized
U.S. infantry battalions, 4,000 French troops, 6,000 British troops
and 50,000 soldiers from the pan-Arab force would cross into Kuwait
from the south to ``liberate it meter by meter.''

   The major maker of barium enema kits is
recalling some products because they may be linked to severe
reactions, including nine deaths, from the common medical
procedure, federal officials said Friday.
   E-Z-EM Inc. of Westbury, N.Y., sent recall notices to customers
a week ago, saying evidence suggests water-soluble proteins in
inflatable latex cuffs on the enema tips may be triggering the
reactions.
   The FDA has received 150 reports of allergic reactions related
to barium enema procedures in 1989 and 1990, said FDA spokeswoman
Susan Cruzan. In nine cases, the patient died, she said.
   The company makes 85 percent to 90 percent of the kits, which
are used to diagnose disorders of the intestines.
   About 8 million to 10 million barium enemas are performed
annually, Cruzan said.
   The reports have been related to the company's enema kits with
inflatable latex cuffs.
   Company officials did not return a telephone call for comment.
   In light of the reports, the FDA asked radiologists and other
health professionals to report any adverse reactions related to
barium enema procedures that have occurred in the past 12 months.
   ``FDA is particularly concerned because some of these allergic
reactions have been fatal and occurred within minutes of beginning
the procedures,'' the agency said in its October issue of FDA Drug
Bulletin, a publication sent to physicians.
   The procedure involves injecting a barium-containing fluid into
the rectum and colon, which enables these organs to show up on an
X-ray.
   In some cases, the reactions occurred after the enema tip had
been inserted, but before the barium had been introduced, the FDA
said.
   The FDA said the cause of the problem is still unclear.

one was hurt and the fire was extinguished within two hours,
authorities said.
   The blaze began shortly before 1:30 p.m. in one section at
Chevron's Cedar Bayou Chemical Plant, said spokesman Clay Hooper. A
Chevron fire brigade at the plant extinguished it by 3:30 p.m.
   Cedar Bayou is a small community near Baytown. The towns are

   The fire broke out in a unit of the plant that uses ethylene to
make an additive for detergents, officials said.

``Germany is the hereditary enemy of France.''
   No violence was reported by the students, most of whom are

   East and West Germany unified Oct. 3, less than a year after the

<HEAD>Thatcher Talks of War if Sanctions on Iraq Fail</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
winding up her Conservative Party's annual conference Friday, told
Britain to prepare for war if sanctions fail in the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   ``We must hope they (sanctions) work. If not, the military
option is there. . . . We must be ready for any contingency,'' she
said, signalling increasing British impatience at the standoff.
   Delegates cheered as Mrs. Thatcher spelled out a tough line on
Iraq in her 45-minute keynote address at the end of the four-day
conference in this south England resort.
   She painted Britain as America's No. 1 ally in the gulf,
rejected plans for economic integration of the European Community,
and attacked the revamped Labor Party as hard-line socialists
masquerading as ``a party of moderation.''
   The hall resounded with applause as the prime minister, who
turns 65 Saturday, threaded her way through 5,000 delegates who
waved Union Jacks and sang the favorite Tory anthem, ``Land of Hope
and Glory.''
   But the party remains in trouble, heavily dependent on her
promises that inflation, which edged up to 10.9 percent Friday,
will fall sharply next year.
   Labor is posing its biggest threat since Mrs. Thatcher won power
11 years ago. The Conservatives have narrowed a yearlong lag in
opinion polls, but Labor remains 8 to 14 points ahead.
   The conference appeared short on new ideas for a party that may
fight an election before its next meeting.
   The weekly Economist, which generally supports the Tories,
commented Friday, ``For a party used to wallowing in victory and
self-congratulation, it was a strangely glum affair.''
   On Iraq, Mrs. Thatcher said President Saddam Hussein must face
war crime charges, pay reparation for the devastation of Kuwait and
be stripped of power to invade again.
   ``This tyrant has taken our people hostage,'' she said. ``You
get him out, make him pay and see that he is never in a position to
do these things again.''
   On Thursday, her foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, urged an
assessment within weeks to determine if sanctions are working or if
only force can end Saddam's Aug. 2 invasion on Iraq.
   Mrs. Thatcher praised President Bush, adding, ``When the call
came to send forces to the gulf, it was independent nations - above
all the United States and Britain - which took rapid and decisive
action.''
   On Britain's relations with the rest of the 12-nation European
Community - the issue that divides her party and Cabinet - she said
she will fight plans for a single currency despite linking the
pound this week to Europe's other major currencies. Sterling joined
the community's exchange rate mechanism.
   She is gambling that inflation will fall as a spinoff of
stabilizing the pound against the strong German mark, combined with
the past two years of high British interest rates.
   Low inflation would enable her to cut interest rates and put the
government in better shape to call an election next year. Mrs.
Thatcher's third five-year term expires in June 1992.

   Moslem fundamentalists have stepped up
attacks on the Afghan capital and are poised for a major assault to
bring down the Communist government, sources said Friday.
   More moderate guerrilla leaders predicted the attack would
accomplish nothing except massive bloodshed and have begun to map
out plans to stop them.
   ``It will be a massacre,'' said one rebel leader, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. He said he feared his outspokenness would
be punished with reduced arms shipments to his fighters.
   There had been a period of relative calm in Kabul, the Afghan
capital, until the fundamentalist guerrillas stepped up attacks.
The government's well-equipped army and air force have responded
with air and artillery strikes, diplomatic and guerrilla sources
said.
   At least 60 people have been killed and scores more injured in
two weeks of heavy fighting.
   There were reports that government troops had decimated two
guerrilla columns marching toward the capital. Those reports could
not be independently confirmed.
   ``We're attacking all the time but the time has not been set yet
for the big offensive,'' said Hamid, a guerrilla spokesman who,
like many Afghans, uses only one name.
   According to the sources, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the most radical
and anti-Western of U.S.-backed guerrilla leaders, has been chosen
to lead the major assault on the capital of 1.5 million.
   For more than 12 years, Pakistan's powerful intelligence agency
has been a conduit for U.S. military aid to the guerrillas, who are
fighting to unseat successive Communist governments in their
neighboring homeland.
   Rumors have been circulating in this dusty border city for weeks
that Hekmatyar and Shah Nawaz Tanai, the former defense minister of
Afghanistan who defected to the guerrillas in March, were planning
another coup attempt.
   Tanai orchestrated a failed coup last March that left hundreds
dead, destroyed sections of the capital and severely handicapped
Afghanistan's air force before forces loyal to President Najibullah
crushed the mutineers.
   Afghan and Pakistani sources say arms shipments to Hekmatyar
have risen dramatically since Benazir Bhutto's government was
ousted on Aug. 6 and replaced by her right-wing opponents.
   Ms. Bhutto reportedly sought a reduced role for the firebrand
Moslem rebel leader.
   ``For months he was getting very little. Now he is getting
everything,'' said another guerrilla spokesman Abdul Wakeel.
   Soviet troops sent to Afghanistan backed up Najibullah's
government until they withdrew from Afghanistan in February 1989.
   The guerrillas had presented a unified front until then, but the
alliance has gradually disintegrated.
   Several key commanders, including Haq and Ahmed Shah Masood -
considered the most effective rebel leader - met Friday to map out
a strategy to stop Hekmatyar and find an acceptable political
alternative to Najibullah.
   Moscow and Washignton are reportedly close to an agreement that
calls for elections, overseen by a transitional government that
includes neither Najibullah nor the guerrilla leadership.

<HEAD>Persian Gulf Crisis at a Glance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here, at a glance, are the latest developments in the Persian
Gulf crisis:
   
   Gunmen in Cairo killed the parliament speaker and three security
men outside a hotel. There was no claim of responsibility. The
attack came after the government warned that terrorists might
strike to punish Egypt for its opposition to Iraq.
   ---
   A Shiite Moslem gunman fired at Christian Gen. Michel Aoun as he
addressed thousands of supporters, but the bullet missed the
general and wounded one of his aides, Aoun's radio station said.
   The assassination attempt came shortly after the Syrian army
moved thousands of troops toward the enclave for an expected attack
on the headquarters of Aoun, who has resisted orders by Lebanon's
government to step down.
   ---
   U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf area now total more than
200,000, including elements of two armored cavalry units that
arrived this week, Pentagon sources said Friday.
   The sources also said a Marine amphibious force is planning a
practice assault on the Arabian coast soon as a trial run for a
possible U.S. invasion of Kuwait.
   ---
   The French magazine L'Express reported that U.S. military
officials have drawn up plans to free Kuwait and defeat Iraq in a
four-day war in November that would destroy Saddam's armed forces.
L'Express said U.S. planners estimated the offensive might cost
20,000 American lives. It gave no estimate for dead of other
nations.
   L'Express said it obtained an outline of the plan from an
unidentified adviser to Defense Secretary Cheney.
   U.S. officials refused to comment, in line with Pentagon
security rules.
   ---
   Western diplomatic defiance of Iraq's seizure of Kuwait weakened
Friday when Germany and Belgium announced that their last envoys
had left the occupied nation.
   In Bonn, a spokesman said the last diplomats, including the
ambassador and his wife, in the German Embassy drove from Kuwait to
Baghdad on Thursday.
   Belgian officials in Brussels said their remaining two diplomats
also left for Baghdad Thursday.
   ---
   Members of Japan's deeply divided parliament hooted at Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu when he opened a special session by asking
for support for his plan to deploy armed forces overseas. Japan has
not sent forces overseas since World War II.
   ---
   Iraq said it may stop Soviet detainees from returning home if
they have knowledge of Iraqi weapons systems. The evacuation began
Sunday and Iraq has promised to let at least 2,000 Soviets leave.
   ---
   An Iraqi opposition party-in-exile said the Iraqi ruling Arab
Baath Socialist Party has circulated a questionnaire asking
prominent members whether they believe Iraq should pull out.
   The claim by the Kurdistan Democratic Party-Iraq could not be
independently confirmed. If true, it would represent an
unprecedented quest for consensus by Saddam Hussein.

   Israel used curfews, roadblocks and water
cannons Friday to stop thousands of Arabs from attending Moslem
Sabbath services at the Temple Mount, where police killed 19
Palestinians earlier this week.
   In the occupied territories, troops shot and killed two
Palestinians and wounded at least 10 in clashes with stone-throwing
youths, Arab reports said.
   Also Friday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Israel would
reject any effort by the U.N. Security Council to send a team to
investigate the Temple Mount deaths, which occurred Monday.
   Shamir said a U.N. investigation would be an infringement on
Israel's sovereignty over Jerusalem. Israel captured the Arab
sector, which contains the Temple Mount, from Jordan in the 1967
Middle East war and later annexed it.
   ``In the recent past in the Middle East, there have been a
number of incidents where people were killed,'' he said. ``We did
not see the Security Council being pressured to such grave
discussions and with such broad outcomes.''
   A Security Council resolution condemning the incident has been
hung up over differences on the form of a U.N. investigation and
whether to emphasize protecting Palestinians. The issues have
divided the United States and its allies.
   The Arab League will hold an urgent meeting on the confrontation
next Wednesday, sources in Tunisia said.
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens said the U.S. was ``trying to walk
a fine line'' in order not to jeopardize its international
coalition against Iraq.
   ``But I think if they conclude that the way to keep this
coalition is to blame Israel for an event whose roots lie in Moslem
fanatacism, they will make a mistake,'' Arens said on Israel
television.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Bibi Natanyahu said the U.N. response to
the events ``lends rioters an international license to continue
their rioting.''
   A Palestinian human rights group, Al Haq, issued a preliminary
report on the killings, calling them a massacre and urging
``international protection'' for Palestinians.
   The group said massive stone-throwing, which police say prompted
their gunfire, did not begin until after tear gas was fired onto
the Temple Mount. It also accused paramilitary border police units
of opening fire without warning.
   Since the revolt against Israeli occupation of the territories
began in December 1987, 760 Palestinians have been killed by
Israeli soldiers or civilians.
   An additional 278 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs,
most on suspicion of collaboration with Israeli authorities.
Forty-eight Israelis have died in the violence.
   The latest victims were Amar Derouchme, 20, from the West Bank
village of Toubas, and Rami Jarar, 18, from nearby Jenin.
   The army said Derouchme was a former prisoner shot by soldiers
in a stone-throwing clash and that it was checking the
circumstances of Jarar's death. Arab reports said Jarar was shot as
soldiers chased curfew violators.
   Monday's rioting on the Temple Mount - sacred to both Moslems
and Jews - started when Arabs threw stones down at Jews worshiping
below at the Western Wall, also known as the Wailing Wall.
   The Moslems had been inflamed by rumors that a zealous Jewish
group, the Temple Mount Faithful, was planning a march to the Mount
to reclaim the site for Judaism.
   Police and Arab hospitals said 19 Palestinians were killed and
140 were injured in police gunfire on the Mount. At least 28 Jewish
civilians and six police were injured in the stoning, police said.
   Israeli politicians on the left and right charged that Israeli
security forces were unprepared for trouble despite advance
warnings. Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek accused the Arabs of
planning the riot.
   Police Chief Yaacov Terner said, however, the rioting was
spontaneous and that there was no concrete intelligence that a
major Arab demonstration was planned.
   On Friday, hundreds of police and paramilitary units were on
duty around the Mount, and a helicopter circled above.
   Palestinians from the West Bank were stopped by army roadblocks
from approaching Jerusalem. In the city, police blocked hundreds of
young men from walking to prayers, halting them at the gates to the
Old City or to the Mount.
   Police turned water cannons on a group of 200 Palestinian youths
who tried to march to the Mount. The youths retreated to a nearby
street and pelted passing cars with stones.
   About 2,000 managed to attend the prayers, about one-fifth the
usual Friday crowd. At the service, prayer leader Sheik Mohammed
Hussein praised those killed Monday as ``martyrs'' and pledged:
``We will defend our mosque until the last drop of our blood.''
   His sermon was interrupted by worshipers' shouts of ``God,
destroy the Jews.''
   Many Palestinians also were blocked from prayers by army
curfews. More than one million Palestinians in Arab east Jerusalem,
the West Bank and Gaza were confined to their homes for a fifth day
because of Monday's riot.
   Residents of the Gaza Strip used a two-hour lifting of the
curfew Friday to burn tires and shout anti-Israeli slogans in
street demonstrations, residents said.

   The head of Northrop Corp. defended his
company Friday against charges that the manufacturer of the B-2
bomber can't manage its business.
   ``Northrop's long record as an asset to this country deserves to
be weighed in the haste to discuss its liabilities,'' said Kent
Kresa, who is chairman of the board, president and chief executive
officer.
   Kresa's testimony came at the end of a difficult week for
Northrop. A top Air Force official testified on Tuesday about
deficiences in six major areas at the company, including cost and
schedule estimates.
   The Air Force's assistant secretary for acquisition, Jack Welch,
said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that testing of the
second B-2 bomber had been delayed nine months.
   Meanwhile, the House approved a 1991 defense appropriations bill
that halts production of the B-2 bomber at 15 planes. Lawmakers
have expressed dismay over the aircraft's cost of nearly $865
million a copy.
   In a lengthy statement, Kresa said he accepts responsibility for
the ``failures of individuals and management oversight that took
place in the past.''
   ``Our failings should never have occurred. The systems that
allowed them to occur have been changed and are being changed. Some
changes in our business and management systems we should have made
long ago, and didn't,'' Kresa said.
   The Northrop president detailed steps the company has taken,
including changes in top management and an examination of values
and ethics among employees.
   Kresa said lawmakers were ``rightfully outraged'' by the events
that led to criminal penalties against Northrop.
   Northrop pleaded guilty in February to 34 counts of fraud and
was fined $17 million, the largest criminal fine ever imposed on a
defense contractor. The plea stems from charges that Northrop
falsified reports on the air-launched cruise missile and conducted
improper tests on the Harrier AV-8B jet.
   In his appearance before the House Goverment Operations
subcommittee on legislation and national security, Kresa sought to
assure lawmakers about Northrop's major program, the B-2 bomber.
   The stealth aircraft and employees on the project have faced
allegations of overcharging, mismanagement and destruction of
material, Kresa said. Since those charges in February 1988, the
Justice Department, Air Force and Pentagon have been unable to find
any evidence to support the allegations, he said.
   ``Not a single charge has been placed against anyone for
anything,'' Kresa said.

<HEAD>Barry Asks Retrial, Arguing Marshals May Have Influenced Jurors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry's attorney asked on Friday
for a retrial, saying deputy U.S. marshals may have influenced
jurors by telling them alternate jurors would have voted to convict
the mayor of all charges.
   Attorney R. Kenneth Mundy also argued that a retrial was
justified because some jurors witnessed an undercover drug sting
operation at the hotel where they were sequestered.
   Barry was convicted on Aug. 10 of a misdemeanor cocaine
possession charge and acquitted of another. The jury could not
reach a verdict on 12 other charges, including three felony perjury
counts, and prosecutors have said they won't pursue a new trial on
those.
   Mundy asked in court papers for a postponement of next Friday's
scheduled pre-sentencing hearing. Barry's parole officer had
earlier asked a delay in that proceeding in order to prepare a
pre-sentencing report for U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson.
   Mundy's request for a retrial comes following interviews with
jurors in the case who said deputy U.S. marshals told them the
alternate panelists would have voted ``guilty, guilty, guilty.''
   According to Mundy's filing, at least two of the jurors wondered
whether the drug sting at their hotel had been staged for their
benefit.
   Barry had been arrested in an undercover sting operation on Jan.
18. That incident produced one of the misdemeanor possession
charges the jury could not decide.
   The mayor is scheduled for sentencing on Oct. 26. He could face
a maximum penalty of one year in pison and a $100,000 fine.

   Dr. Walter Ames Compton, a former chairman
of Miles Inc. whose research into nutrition led to the introduction
of One-A-Day vitamin supplements and chewable children's vitamins,
has died at age 79.
   Compton died at his home Thursday. Hartzler-Gutermuth Funeral
Home said the cause of death was Alzheimer's disease.
   His career at Elkhart-based Miles Inc., formerly known as Miles
Laboratories, spanned more than 45 years, and culminated in his
appointment as president in 1964 and chairman in 1973. He retired
in 1981, when he was elected honorary chairman.
   He began working at Miles while still in medical school, serving
as a summer assistant to J. Maurice Treneer, the father of
Alka-Seltzer. In 1938, he was named the company's first medical and
research director.
   Two years later, his research paid off with Miles' introduction
of One-A-Day vitamin supplements. The company introduced Chocks,
the first chewable children's vitamin, in 1960. Flintstones
chewable vitamins and the Bugs Bunny vitamin line followed.
   ``Dr. Compton was the first at Miles to see the connection
between nutrition and health,'' reported a Miles publication issued
to celebrate the corporation's 100th birthday in 1984.
   Survivors include his wife, Phoebe; three daughters; and two
sons.

<TEXT>
   The White House said Friday that President
Bush still plans to veto a major job-discrimination bill despite
last-minute changes designed by proponents to overcome
administration objections.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said changes
adopted by House-Senate conferees did not eliminate features in the
civil rights bill that administration contends would encourage
employers to adopt hiring and promotion quotas to avoid lawsuits.
   ``We still believe this is a quota bill,'' Fitzwater told
reporters. ``We continue to believe a veto is warranted on that
basis.''
   The legislation would undo six Supreme Court decisions that
civil rights lawyers claim make it harder for plaintiffs to prove
employment discrimination.
   The White House statement and a letter by Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh to Congress that summarized the president's objections
to the bill prompted accusations from a leading civil rights group
that the administration was negotiating in bad faith.
   The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights charged in a statement
that White House chief of staff John Sununu and presidential
counsel C. Boyden Gray ``insisted on provisions that would gut the
bill and actually weaken civil rights laws.''
   The group released a copy of a Sept. 21 proposal made by Sununu
and Gray that it said would allow businesses to hire on the basis
of ``legitimate community or customer relationship efforts.''
   ```Customer relations' was the code word used by airlines to
restrict flight attendant jobs to young, single women,'' the civil
rights coalition said.
   ``The administration's proposal could allow law firms, banks and
other employers to bar blacks or Jews or Catholics from certain
jobs because customers prefer not to deal with them.''
   Arthur Fletcher, a leading black Republican whom Bush appointed
to chair the Civil Rights Commission, expressed dismay that the
White House was listening so closely to business interests.
   ``The business community, which seems to have the upper hand on
this one this time, really doesn't want to be held accountable for
their efforts with respect to hiring, training, development and
promotion'' of minorities, Fletcher said.
   A leading Republican member of the House, Hamilton Fish of New
York, also expressed regret over the White House statement.
   Fish said he and other Republican lawmakers who have worked on
the bill have tried without success to meet personally with Bush to
urge his support.
   ``There is still the outside chance'' that Bush will sign the
measure, Fish said. ``I don't think the president is focused on
this. How could he be with the budget, diplomacy and half a dozen
other major issues?''
   Bush has continually said he wants to sign a civil rights bill
but not one that would prompt hiring and promotion quotas.
   Thornburgh said the changes adopted Thursday by House-Senate
conferees ``recognize that the bill contains serious
deficiencies.'' But the amendments ``do not offer substantial
improvement'' and ``in some respects they make the bill worse,'' he
said.
   Language stating that the bill does not require or encourage
quotas won't eliminate the problem, Thornburgh said in a letter to
Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole.
   ``The trouble with the bill is not that it explicitly
`encourages' or `requires' quotas, but that it will inevitably
result in quotas being adopted surreptitiously to avoid the cost
and trouble'' of lawsuits, Thornburgh wrote.
   ``The assertion that the bill ought not have this effect cannot
change the fact that it will,'' the attorney general said.
   Thornburgh's letter also said that despite changes, the bill
still narrowly restricts the ability of employers to defend charges
that business policies unfairly discriminate against women and
minorities.
   Ralph Neas, executive director of the civil rights coalition,
called Thornburgh's description of the bill ``highly misleading and
inaccurate. It does a disservice to the president and the nation.''
   ``They are ignoring all the changes made by the House and
Senate,'' Neas said.
   Neas said language now cited by Thornburgh as objectionable was
included in the bill last summer at Sununu's behest to define
practices that employers could cite in defending discrimination
suits.
   To show that a practice was necessary to good business,
employers would have to show that it bore ``a significant
relationship to successful performance on the job,'' according to
the language.

   Fourteen years after his death, the
estate of billionaire recluse Howard R. Hughes Jr. has been
settled.
   Records show that $1.13 billion, the bulk of Hughes' estate, was
administered through Chancery Court by his cousin, William R.
Lummas. The court approved the final accounting of the Delaware
administration of the estate Tuesday.
   The heart of Hughes' empire was invested in Summa Corp., a
personal holding company incorporated in Delaware.
   Hughes died in 1976 at the age of 72.
   Richard L. Sutton, an attorney for Lummas, said that about $150
million in cash awaits distribution to Hughes' heirs across the
country. Real estate in Nevada and California also will be
liquidated.
   ``For all practical purposes, it is the end of the
administration of the Hughes estate and the heirs have received
their distributions,'' Sutton said.

<HEAD>Russian Supreme Court Overturns Decision on Former KGB General</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS GINSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former KGB general won a partial legal victory
Friday in his battle to get the Kremlin to restore benefits and
honors that it withdrew when he was fired for criticizing the spy
agency.
   The Russian Supreme Court overruled a decision last week by the
Moscow City Court and ordered the city court to reconsider Oleg D.
Kalugin's challenge of his demotion by Soviet Prime Minister
Nikolai Ryzkhov, Tass reported.
   Kalugin, who had accused the KGB of tapping telephones and
spying on free trade unionists, clergymen and others challenging
Communist authorities, was stripped last summer of his rank, honors
and pension.
   If Kalugin is successful in his attempt to have them restored,
it could be a landmark case for citizens challenging official
secrecy about government decisions.
   Kalugin in August complained to the City Court that he was
unfairly demoted on June 29 by Ryzkhov, denied his awards by
President Mikhail Gorbachev and wrongly stripped of his pension by
KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov.
   The Moscow court last week threw out the complaint against
Ryzkhov on the grounds that the decision had been taken by the
13-member Council of Ministers - Ryzkhov's Cabinet - and no person
could be singled out.
   But Kalugin's lawyers submitted statements by several ministers
that the decision to demote Kalugin was made without their
knowledge.
   The Supreme Court ordered the Moscow court to review Kalugin's
complaint against Ryzkhov.
   ``Appeals can be lodged against a particular official's personal
actions, as well as his actions on behalf of the body he
represents,'' Tass quoted the high court as saying.
   Kalugin called the ruling a ``step towards justice.''
   The city court also is considering the complaint against KGB
chief Kryuchkov, but has taken no action on the allegation against
Gorbachev. The three-judge panel is scheduled to meet again Oct.
23.
   Under the reforms introduced by Gorbachev, the Soviet Parliament
has asserted greater control over the government. But Kalugin and
other reformers argue that many officials continue to follow secret
orders.
   Officials in the KGB, which in earlier years arrested,
incarcerated and executed millions of citizens with impunity, have
told the Soviet people that the days of terror are over.
   But the KGB and the Soviet leadership reacted harshly last
summer after Kalugin went public with his criticism of the agency,
which gathers intelligence abroad and is responsible for state
security at home.
   Publicity surrounding the case helped Kalugin win a seat
representing the southern Russian city of Krasnodar in the Soviet
parliament last month.
   Viktor Alexeyev, chief of the KGB legal department, told the
court that the agency revoked Kalugin's military pension after he
was demoted, in accordance with a Soviet law. Alexeyev said
Kalugin, 55, could receive a normal old-age pension when he becomes
eligible, in five years.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Former President Jimmy Carter spent
five hours in Haiti on a visit Friday in support of December
general elections here.
   ``The elections this year will be successful. They will be
honest and free and open, and also safe,'' Carter said in an
interview with the independent Radio Haiti-Inter.
   Elections are scheduled for Dec. 16. Carter was on his way to
Guyana, the South American country where preparations for elections
are also being made.
   He arrived by private plane at International Airport and was
welcomed by Foreign Affairs Minister Paul Christian Latortue.
Carter paid courtesy calls on President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot and
army chief of staff Lt. Gen. Herard Abraham.
   In the company of Electoral Council President Jean-Robert
Sabalat, Carter inspected voter-registration bureaus in the
capital.
   Carter said registration in rural areas was very good, but in
some parts of the capital ``not many people have registered yet.''
   This poor Caribbean island nation has 3 million potential
voters. In 1987, during the last attempt at free general elections,
75 percent of eligible voters registered. The election collapsed
when thugs supported by the army shot and hacked to death at least
34 voters. Hundreds were killed and wounded in pre-election
violence.
   The three-week voter-registration period began Oct. 5.
   Carter arrived at 9:30 a.m. and left for Guyana at 2:30 p.m.
   It was his third visit to Haiti since Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot's
provisional government took power in March. He had visited Haiti in
October 1987.
   ``The army is giving full support to the election this time,''
Carter said.
   The president-elect will be sworn in on Feb. 7, 1991, on the
fifth anniversary of the overthrow of dictator Jean-Claude
Duvalier.
   Elections will be monitored by the United Nations, the
Organization for American States, the Caribbean Community and
Carter Center observers. Carter said he would return himself in
December.
   He was accompanied on Friday by his wife Rosalynn and by Robert
Pastor, Latin American specialist at the Carter Center.

<HEAD>Committee Approves $57 Billion More for Bailout</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Senate Banking Committee on Friday
approved $57 billion in new taxpayer bailout funds for savings and
loan depositors - more than the $50 billion committed in the
original rescue package enacted just 14 months ago.
   On a voice vote with no audible dissent, the 21-member committee
gave its assent to a plan carrying the bailout through the 1991
fiscal year that began just 13 days ago after Bush administration
officials said the rescue effort would falter for a lack of funds.
   While administration officials had been saying since June that
the bailout would need another $40 billion to $80 billion in new
government money, they had made no specific request to Congress
until this past Wednesday.
   Bush had contended the $50 billion he requested and received
from Congress last year to close or merge insolvent thrifts and
cover their losses of federally insured deposits would put the S&amp;L
crisis behind the nation.
   But with declining real estate values in many areas of the
country, the losses have continued to swell as regulators moved
into the insolvent or nearly insolvent thrifts.
   On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady wrote the
chairmen of the Senate and House banking committees that the
bailout ``will virtually cease within the next two months unless
additional funds are provided.''
   Brady requested $40 billion in new money to carry the rescue
through the next 12 months.
   But he also wanted lawmakers to abandon their requirement that
the Resolution Trust Corp. maintain a 15 percent reserve to cover
more unexpected losses in the event the value of assets on S&amp;L
books fall further.
   To maintain those reserves, he said, would require another $17
billion.
   Rather than see the present $8 billion reserve exhausted, the
Senate committee opted to provide the full $57 billion, even though
the administration expects to spend only about $50 billion this
fiscal year.
   House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, said
Friday that his panel will take up Brady's request next week.
   Money to carry out the plan must be provided through a separate
appropriations bill.

<TEXT>
   The Times Mirror Center for The People &amp; The
Press said Friday a national poll it took last month showed that 21
percent o the people, not 51 percent as reported, associated
Republicans with ``rich, powerful moneyed interests.''
   In a previous poll three years ago, 18 percent made such an
association. The big jump to 51 percent was widely published and
frequently cited by political commentators.
   Times Mirror said the incorrect figure was due to a computing
error.
   It said it also overstated the percentage of people who
spontaneously said they associated Republicanism with conservatism,
being business oriented and not being for the people.
   Scott Sowry, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee,
said the party was certain that the apparent jump was an error.
   ``That's what we've been saying all along,'' Sowry said.

   Bawdy rappers 2 Live Crew face
contempt of court charges for showing up late to their own
obscenity trial on Friday.
   Band members Luther Campbell and Chris Wongwon showed up 30
minutes late for Friday's proceedings and Mark Ross trailed in more
than an hour late, infuriating Broward County Judge June Johnson.
   Johnson said she would sentence the three on contempt charges
when the trial ends. Each faces up to six months in jail.
   The three are on trial on misdemeanor obscenity charges stemming
from a June 10 adults-only performance at a nightclub in nearby
Hollywood. The performance came four days after a federal judge
declared obscene their sexually explicit album, ``As Nasty As They
Wanna Be.''
   If convicted, each rapper faces up to a year in jail and fines
of up to $1,000 each.
   On the fifth day of jury selection, the judge upheld the
prosecution's removal of a potential black juror. Defense attorney
Bruce Rogow failed to persuade the judge that the man had been
removed because of his race.
   Rogow has unsuccessfully tried to show that Broward's selection
of jurors from voter registration lists is unconstitutional because
blacks and youths are underrepresented.
   No jurors had been chosen by Friday afternoon.
   2 Live Crew members maintain young and black jurors are needed
for a fair trial because obscenity is defined by local community
standards.
   Broward Assistant State Attorney Pedro Dijols, who is black,
said the juror candidate, Vernard Kinnel, had identified himself as
a 2 Live Crew fan.
   ``I want the record to clearly reflect, very clearly, your
honor, this prosecutor is a black Puerto Rican and this prosecutor
has heard an answer from Mr. Kinnel that he is a fan of this
particular group that we have on trial,'' Dijols told the judge
Thursday.
   Johnson ruled Friday that Kinnel's removal was not racially
motivated.
   Of the 70-member jury pool, only seven potential jurors remained
from the first string of 25 potential jurors. One was a middle-aged
black man.
   The second group of 25 potential jurors was brought in Friday
afternoon, and 11 had been eliminated by day's end. Those remaining
included three middle-aged black women.
   Defense attorneys said they believed jury selection would be
completed by Monday afternoon.
   Last week, an all-white jury convicted Fort Lauderdale record
store owner Charles Freeman of a similar obscenity charge for
selling a tape of ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' to an undercover
deputy.

<HEAD>Rwandan Ambassador Suspects Ugandan Plot In Invasion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ambassador from Rwanda says that refugees
who have invaded the central African country appear to be backed by
the Ugandan government and have been receiving arms from fellow
exiles based in the United States.
   Ambassador Aloys Uwimana said he asked U.S. officials to assess
the possibility of an invasion two years ago and they told him ``no
movement was afoot.'' Several thousand armed refugees from the
Tutsi tribe invaded the country from Uganda Sept. 30, and fighting
continues.
   Uwimana was interviewed after the embassy released a statement
Thursday denying accusations that government soldiers have
massacred hundreds of civilians belonging to the minority Tutsi
tribe, which is also the tribe of Uganda's president, Yoweri
Museveni.
   Uwimana said there is growing suspicion that Ugandan leaders are
behind the invasion by Rwandan Tutsis who have been living in
Uganda for two decades.
   ``We don't want to directly charge the government of Uganda, but
we recognize the facts,'' the ambassador said.
   The invaders are from a group of 250,000 people who fled Rwanda
two decades ago after the majority Hutu tribe took over rule of the
country from the Tutsi.
   Uwimana said about 15 Rwandan Tutsis representing the refugees
in Uganda are now based in the United States and have been involved
in purchasing black market arms for the invading group.
   State Department spokesman Mark Dillen said Friday that U.S.
officials in Rwanda had spoken with travelers from troubled areas
of the country but could not confirm whether a massacre took place.
   Dillen said he could not comment on Uwimana's statements about
U.S.-based rebels or the possibility of Ugandan involvement. U.S.
officials earlier said they were considering a Rwanda request for
medical and other supplies.
   Dillen said the conflict was continuing in the northeast part of
the country, with fighting centered around the towns of Gatsibo and
Gabiro. The capital, Kigali, remained calm although a nighttime
curfew was in effect, the spokesman said.
   U.S. civilians have been evacuated and the State Department has
warned U.S. citizens to avoid travel to the country.
   Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana said 14 civilians had been
killed in fighting between government and rebel forces and about
3,000 people had been arrested, many of them belonging to the Tutsi
tribe. He also denied the reports from Rwandan exiles that soldiers
fired on civilians and killed more than 1,000 people in 10 villages
on the border with Uganda.
   On Thursday, the United States ``underlined to the government of
Rwanda the importance of respect for human rights,'' Dillen said.
``In particular, we have urged the government of Rwanda to enforce
President Habyarimana's declaration that Rwandans should avoid any
acts of retribution based on ethnic differences.''
   Habyarimana and most of the people in his government belong to
the Hutu tribe, which makes up 85 percent of Rwanda's population.

<TEXT>
   A U.S.-led international committee met a
second time Friday to discuss providing billions of dollars in
economic aid to countries hurt by the Persian Gulf crisis but did
not resolve several disputes dividing its members.
   The three-hour closed-door meeting at the U.S. Treasury of
representatives of 20 countries and international bodies was the
second session of the Gulf Crisis Financial Coordination Group.
   President Bush announced formation of the group on Sept. 25,
calling for a generous response from the world community to help
countries hurt by the U.N.-sponsored embargo of Iraq.
   The administration believes its effort o isolate Iraq might
begin to crumble unless aid is funneled to countries who lost trade
with Iraq or who are coping with the flood of refugees produced by
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The coordinating group has been divided by such basic issues as
how much money should be contributed and which countries should
receive it.
   An administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity
said the group resolved several administrative issues in Friday's
meeting.
   It agreed to rotate the location of the meetings and awarded the
chairmanship of the group to Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
A State Department official will serve as deputy chairman.
   The next meeting was planned for Rome during the first two weeks
of November.
   The official said the substantive issues, athough discussed,
were not resolved but nevertheless described the meeting as ``quite
successful.'' However, a senior Treasury official shortly after the
Sept. 26 session had said most of the unresolved matters would be
cleared up before Friday's meeting.
   Officials said previously that the United States would like to
channel most of the aid to three ``front line'' states - Egypt,
Jordan and Turkey. However, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have complained
that Jordan is showing reluctance to support the trade embargo and
therefore should not get help.
   And, some nations think the list of aid recipients should be
expanded to include Third World nations particularly hard hit by
oil prices rising over $40 a barrel.
   A World Bank study had identified Bangladesh, India, Pakistan,
the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Sudan as among the nations hardest
hit.
   There had also been disagreement over the amount of aid.
According to a German official, the United States had been pushing
for $14.5 billion, while some European countries believed $9
billion was a more realistic figure.
   The nations participating with the United States in the
coordinating group are Japan, Germany, Great Britain, France,
Canada, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates,
Qatar, South Korea, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and
Switzerland.
   Also participating are representatives of the 12-nation European
Community, the Gulf Cooperation Council of Persian Gulf countries
and the 154-nation International Monetary Fund and its sister
lending organization, the World Bank.

<HEAD>Court Bars Former Guatemalan Dictator as Presidential Candidate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALFONSO ANZUETO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled Friday that former
dictator Efrain Rios Montt and his running mates were not qualified
to run for president in next month's national elections.
   Chief Justice Edmundo Vasquez Martinez announced the court's
decision, which upheld an Aug. 22 ruling by the National Election
Board that the constitution barred former dictators from running
for office.
   Rios Montt, then a brigadier general, took power after a
military coup in March 1982 and ruled Guatemala until August 1983
when he was removed by another coup.
   Pending the court's ruling, Rios Montt has campaigned hard, and
has been leading in polls for the Nov. 11 presidential race.
   The court, acting on an appeal by Rios Montt's three-party
coalition, had issued an injunction Sept. 12 ordering the election
board to register the retired general as a candidate temporarily
until it could hear arguments in the case.
   In reversing the injunction, Vasquez Martinez told a news
conference the appeal ``lacked legal merit.''
   He said Rios Montt's backers can still appeal to Guatemala's
Constitutional Court within 48 hours.
   Vasquez Martinez said the nine-member court also barred Rios
Montt's running mate, Harris Whitbeck Pinol, and the rest of his
coalition ticket, including candidates for legislator and a Central
American congress.
   Rios Montt's spokesman, Juan Callejas, said the coalition will
take the case to the Constitutional Court.
   ``We will appeal according to our plan,'' Callejas said in a
telephone interview. He said the publicity the case generated has
been helping Rios Montt's campaign.
   ``We will win on the first round November 11,'' he said.
   Guatemalans seeking a strong hand in government have been
turning to Rios Montt and his coalition of the United National
Front, the Institutional Democratic Party and the Republican Front,
polls show.
   Guatemala is troubled by an upsurge of violence and reports of
official corruption and drug smuggling.
   A born-again Christian, Rios Montt was one of three officers
asked by the armed forces to take over the country after the 1982
coup. That June he bounced the other two and named himself
president.
   While president, he drew international condemnation by ordering
the execution by firing squad of more than a dozen leftist
guerrilla leaders. Military troops also were accused of conducting
brutal campaign that left thousands of peasants dead in the
northwest highlands.
   The board's decision confirmed a Supreme Court opinion based on
Article 186 of Guatemala's 1985 constitution.
   According to that provision, neither ``the head and leaders of a
coup, armed revolution or similar movement that has altered
constitutional order, nor those who have assumed the head of
government as a result can run for president or vice-president.''
   Guatemala's 19 political parties are fielding a total of 13
candidates for the presidential race. If no candidate gets 50
percent of the vote in November a runoff will be held Jan. 6 among
the two top vote-getters.
   The winner will replace Vinicio Cerezo, a centrist Christian
Democrat voted in for a five-year term in January 1986, and only
the second civilian president in more than three decades.
   Before Cerezo, Guatemala was ruled by rightist military officers
- some elected and some placed in power through coups - who have
been battling a leftist insurrection since the early 1960s. The
only other civilian president was Julio Cesar Mendez Montenegro,
who served from 1966 to 1970.
   The November balloting will also elect a vice president, a
national legislature, about 300 municipal governments nationwide,
and deputies to a Central American Parliament to be created soon by
Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Costa Rica.

<TEXT>
   Top business leaders predicted Friday
that the U.S. economy will stagnate during the second half of this
year. A minority said a recession is here or on the way.
   The Business Council's fall forecast projected a nearly
imperceptible 0.3 percent economic growth rate in the second half
of 1990, and said oil-driven inflation will climb to 6.1 percent
before falling back below current levels.
   One-fourth of the corporate economists preparing the report
foresee a recession, a minority supported by several of the
Business Council members.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, we're in a phase of a recession,''
said Edmund T. Pratt Jr., chairman of Pfizer Inc.
   Asked whether he thought the nation ws in a recession, Lewis T.
Preston, chairman of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., replied: ``I do.''
   The outlook for a short boost in inflation is based on the
assumption there will be no war in the Persian Gulf.
   The forecast was presented to the 100 leaders of the nation's
top corporations at their semiannual, two-day meeting at this
mountain resort.
   Preston, a council vice chairman, noted major differences
between the council's forecast last spring and the current one.
   The projections prepared by the 19 corporate economists for the
May meeting predicted 2 percent economic growth in the second half
of the year and 2.5 percent in 1991. The current expectation
foresees just 0.3 percent growth in the second half, 1.2 percent in
the first half of 1991 and 2.6 percent in the second.
   ``There's an even bigger change in mood'' on the part of the
economists, Preston told reporters. After suggesting moderate
growth last May, ``now, by contrast, they're much more worried -
not worried enough, in my judgment - but much more worried.''
   Indeed, while only five of the 19 believe an economic downturn
will occur in 1990's final quarter, the panel has increased its
recession risk assessment from 22 percent in its April survey to 39
percent in its latest survey completed in September.
   Economists generally define a recession as two straight quarters
of negative economic growth.
   ``The probability of recession by mid-year 1991 has increased
from 29 percent to 47 percent,'' their report said.
   Preston said the economists are virtually unanimous in thinking
that the recent oil price hikes will not last.
   ``That's because of the critical assumption of a decided
majority that there either will be no Persian Gulf hostilities or
that if hostilities do occur, they will be relatively brief and not
result in significant damage to oil field facilities,'' he said.
   ``Because the consultants believe oil prices will come down
significantly, they do not at this point believe that what has
happened to crude will have permanently distorting effect on the
Consumer Price Inex,'' he added.
   In their report, the economists said they expect CPI inflation
to reach 6.1 percent by year's end and then slow to 4.5 percent in
the first half of 1991 and to 4.2 percent in the second.
   Another council member, Allen E. Murray, chairman of Mobil
Corp., told reporters he sees no petroleum shortages this winter
and that crude oil prices which have doubled since the Aug. 2 Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait will ``come down and come down hard.''
   ``This assumes no war,'' he added.
   Other highlights of the council forecast included:
   -The economists expect economic weakness to be concentrated in
housing, consumer spending on durable goods and business
investment.
   -Industrial production will advance less than 1 percent between
the middle of 1990 and the middle of 1991 before accelerating to a
3.6 percent annual rate in the second half. However, orders, sales
and profits in the industrial sector will show little or no growth
over the next six to nine months.
   -Most of the council economists foresee continuing, gradual
improvement in the nation's merchandise trade balance, with the gap
declining from $109 billion in 1989 to $98 billion in 1990 and $91
billion in 1991.

<HEAD>West Africans Plan Summit to Discuss Liberia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An emergency summit of West African
leaders will focus on Liberia's civil war and the continued role of
a regional military force in the nation, a presidential spokesman
said Friday.
   President Felix Houphouet-Boigny called the meeting for Monday
in his hometown of Yamoussoukro. At least five heads of state are
expected to attend, said spokesman Yves Binni, who would not
identify the leaders.
   Members of the 16-nation Economic Community of West African
States have become split over its deployment of a five-nation army
to Liberia. The 6,000-member troop force - including soldiers from
Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Gambia and Sierra Leone - was sent Aug. 5
to help end Liberia's fighting.
   At least 5,000 civilians have been killed by three warring sides
and about 250,000 Liberians have fled to neighboring states.
Another 250,000 of the nation's 3.2 million people have been
displaced within their country since rebel leader Charles Taylor
invaded from Ivory Coast on Dec. 24.
   This week, the West African force drove Taylor's rebels from the
Liberian capital of Monrovia to the eastern suburb of Paynesville.
   The West Africans plan to install an interim government named by
exiled and refugee Liberian politicians, business leaders and
clergy. Taylor has named himself president of his own government
and says the other administration, with a mandate to organize
elections, is a puppet of West African states.
   Ivory Coast's support for Taylor was the subject of a meeting
last week between Houphouet-Boigny and U.S. Ambassador Donald
Petterson, the top State Department official for Liberia.
   Diplomatic sources in Abidjan said Petterson tried to persuade
Houphouet-Boigny not to back calls for a withdrawal of the West
African army.
   The diplomats said the Ivory Coast leader surprised Petterson by
immediately telephoning six heads of states and inviting them to a
summit.
   Ivory Coast denies backing Taylor, though defense sources
confirm Ivorian police have escorted truckloads of weapons across
Ivory Coast's western border into rebel-held Liberian territory.
   Taylor's fighters have overrun most of the country, while a
breakaway rebel faction led by Prince Johnson remains in Monrovia
along with remnants of slain President Samuel Doe's army.
   President Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso, where some Taylor
rebels say they trained, has denounced the West African deployment
and warned the conflict could spread to neighboring states.

   Challenger Anatoly Karpov, trailing by a game in
the $3 million World Chess Championship, used one of his three
time-outs to postpone Friday night's match against Garry Kasparov.
   Karpov sent word of his decision at 11:53 a.m., seven minutes
before the deadline for a time-out. Chief Arbiter Geurt Gijssen was
phoned by Lajos Portisch, Karpov's second, with the news of the
postponement.
   They do things a little differently in the chess world than in
other competitions. Portisch was required to sing a song familiar
to Gijssen in order to prove the call was legitimate.
   ``This was accomplished to his satisfaction,'' the championship
media center said in a statement.
   Karpov and Kasparov battled to a draw in Monday night's opening
match, with the champion drawing first blood with a victory on
Wednesday. The championship will resume on Monday at 5:30 p.m.,
with Karpov playing the white pieces.
   Karpov provided no explanation for his decision in a letter
delivered to Gijssen and signed by Dr. Nikolai Krogius, head of the
challenger's delegation. Each player has the right to take three
time-outs during the 24-match competition. Generally, the time-outs
are taken on a Monday or Friday to give a player a long weekend.
They can also be used for illness.

   The proportion of unwanted births among women
who have been married is increasing, according to the National
Center for Health Statistics released Friday.
   The center's National Survey of Family Growth said that in a
random sampling weighted to represent the entire population, 10.3
percent of the 1.6 million births to these women that occurred
between 1983 and 1988 were unwanted at the time of conception.
   The proportion was 14.3 percent in a 1973 survey and had dropped
to 7.7 percent in 1982.
   The increase was most pronounced among women living below the
poverty line. From 1982-88, the proportion of births unwanted at
the time of conception among this group rose 74 percent - from 11.9
percent to 20.7 percent.
   Among women who had never been married, a quarter of the 2.5
million births from 1983-88 were unwanted at the time of pregnancy.

<HEAD>Government in Nigeria Legalizes Controversial Voting Method</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ignoring mounting opposition, the military
on Friday enacted a decree that legalizes a balloting system in
which the voters must stand in line behind the candidate of their
choice.
   The system that officials call ``open balloting'' will be used
in local council elections in Dec. 8 to test the popularity of two
political parties the government created to end military rule.
   Under the decree, voters must arrive at polling booths by 11
a.m. and expect to spend the day there.
   Nigeria is Africa's most populous country with about 119 million
residents.
   The government's manipulation has made many voters apathetic,
critics say, and waiting in line will only irritate them more,
creating a headache for police.
   Problems are expected particularly in the predominantly Moslem
northern states, where religious leaders have said it would be
unthinkable for male and female voters to line up together.
   Professor Humphrey Nwosu, chairman of the National Electoral
Commission, said last month the system was chosen because it was
``something indigenous, simple, uncomplicated, cost-effective and
credible.''
   Voters will choose between candidates of the right-leaning
National Republican Convention and left-of-center Social Democratic
Party.
   President Gen. Ibrahim Babangida created the two parties and
wrote their manifestos last year after he banned all 13 independent
groups seeking to contest promised 1992 general elections.
   Babangida said he wanted to do away with political groupings
divided along tribal and religious lines and start from scratch.
   But critics say civilian politicians have managed to evade
Babangida's intentions, colonizing the created parties with their
own personal agendas.
   Politicians representing the Moslem north have essentaillly
taken over the Republican party, these critics say, while those
representing the mostly Christian and animist south occupied the
Social Democratic Party.
   Babangida seized power on Aug. 27, 1985, the sixth military man
to take power since Nigeria's independence from Britain in 1960.
Nigeria has not had a successful civilian government in that time.

<TEXT>
   Scientists detonated a nuclear weapon Friday
after a 2{-hour technical delay, delivering a blast that was felt
in Las Vegas high rises, 105 miles from ground zero.
   The weapon was up to 10 times more powerful than the atomic bomb
that destroyed Hiroshima.
   Friday's test was the seventh of the year and the third in three
weeks at the sprawling Nevada Test Site.
   A 5.7 reading on the Richter scale was recorded at the National
Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., according to
spokesman Waverly Person.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage
if it occurs in a populated area.
   Department of Energy spokesman Jim Boyer, who monitored the test
34 miles from ground zero, said scientists seemed pleased with the
results.
   ``All I see is happy faces,'' Boyer said. ``The situation
appears normal. Everything looks real good.''
   The test, code-named Tenabo, was scheduled for 8 a.m., but was
delayed until 10:30 a.m. because of technical problems.
   ``The test was put on hold until they checked out the
mechanisms,'' Boyer said. ``I don't have any details and I doubt if
they'd tell me. Obviously, it wasn't anything very serious.''
   The nuclear weapon was buried 2,000 feet beneath Pahute Mesa,
about 105 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
   DOE monitors atop high rise buildings in Las Vegas said the
blast was ``felt distinctly'' at the Sahara, Rio and Palace Station
hotels.
   Gilbert Yarchever, who has an apartment on the 25th floor of the
Regency Towers, a high rise building east of the Las Vegas Strip,
said ``anything hanging moved.''
   The blast was listed as having an explosive force of 20,000 to
150,000 tons of TNT, the upper limit allowed by nuclear treaties
with the Soviet Union.
   The atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima had an explosive force
of 15,000 tons.
   Managers of high rise buildings were warned by the DOE that the
explosion could cause some motion, a standard warning given when a
blast is expected near the upper limits.
   The test was originally scheduled for Thursday morning, but was
postponed because of winds blowing toward Las Vegas. Tests are
called off if winds are blowing toward a populated area in case
radioactive gases escape from the underground test area.

   Rwanda insisted on Friday its soldiers had
killed hundreds of rebels wearing civilian clothes, not innocent
villagers. It agreed to let a Vatican-led committee monitor
conditions for captured rebel suspects.
   The government also announced it freed about 1,200 of nearly
3,000 suspected rebel supporters arrested in Kigali, capital of the
small central African nation.
   Foreign governments expressed concern about counterinsurgency
measures in Rwanda after people who fled into Uganda said soldiers
indiscriminantly fired on civilians in up to 10 villages Monday and
killed more than 1,000 people.
   Most of those held are members of the minority Tutsi tribe and
include businessmen, intellectuals, senior civil servants and
clergymen, according to sources in Kigali. A predominately Tutsi
refugee force invaded Rwanda from neighoring Uganda Sept. 30.
   To ease international concern, Rwanda said Friday it will allow
a diplomatic committee to see how detainees are being treated. The
group will be led by the Vatican's representative in Rwanda and
will include envoys of Germany, Burundi and the International
Committee of the Red Cross.
   President Juvenal Habyarimana on Wednesday denied that any
civilians died.
   Foreign Minister Casimir Bizimungu later said troops attacked
rebels who had changed into civilian clothes.
   Bizimungu estimated that from 200 to 300 insurgents were killed,
according to an African envoy who attended a Thursday briefing.
   ``He told us no civilians were killed,'' the envoy said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The information was made available to The Associated Press in
Nairobi.
   In Washington, the State Department said it stressed ``the
importance of respect for human rights. In particular, we have
urged the government of Rwanda to enforce their president's
declaration that Rwandans should avoid any acts of retribution
based on ethnic differences.''
   The Department said it had been unable to confirm details of the
purported massacre.
   In the early 1960s, the majority Hutu group crushed a Tutsi
uprising, killing more than 10,000 and forcing hundreds of
thousands to flee, including the Tutsi king Kigeri V.
   Rwanda refuses to repatriate any of the refugees, estimated at
more than 1 million, citing overcrowding. The Maryland-sized
country of 8 million averages about 566 people per square mile,
about nine times the U.S. average.
   The rebel force, which includes many deserters from Uganda's
army, seeks to overthrow Habyarimana. The rebels accuse his
government of corruption, human rights issues and failing to
resolve the refugee problem.
   They are led by a former Ugandan army commander, Maj. Gen. Fred.
Rwigyema, a Tutsi of Rwandan origin, and are based in northeastern
Rwanda. They call themselves the Rwandese Patriotic Front and deny
they seek to restore the monarchy.
   Bizimungu accused Uganda of supporting the rebels, despite its
condemnation of the invasion. He claimed Rwigyema was in Kampala,
the Ugandan capital, last weekend stocking up on food and weapons.
   A statement from the Rwandese Embassy in Washington Friday
claimed a group of Ugandans has worked since 1984 to secretly arm
refugees planning an attack. The group, which calls itself The
Rwandan Diaspora, claimed it was organizing education aid for Tutsi
children and sought donations from major U.S. corporations and
groups, the statement said. The group has been shipping weapons to
Uganda for the rebels since 1987, it said.
   There was no immediate comment from several people identified by
the embassy as leaders of the group.

<TEXT>
   Hunters who paid thousands of dollars to
gun down endangered animals left their names, addresses and
pictures of themselves with their kills as evidence, game officials
said Friday.
   ``It will be an officer's dream'' to seek charges against the
hunters, state game ranger Sam Cottrell said. ``We even have their
pictures.''
   Cottrell was one of more than two dozen federal and state agents
who raided Texoma Hunting Wilderness in southeastern Oklahoma
Wednesday, closing down the hunting range and confiscating piles of
records and animal skins. Several live animals were seized.
   ``It was pretty awful. It was not much sport at all,'' Tom
McKay, senior resident agent for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, said Friday.
   McKay said each hunter paid from $1,000 to $4,000 to select an
animal from a cage, have it released onto a ``killing area'' about
the size of a football field and shoot it.
   Among the native animals killed were grizzly bears, black bears,
deer, elk and cougars, all of which are protected under federal or
state laws.
   McKay said the game refuge had a permit for the hunting of
certain exotic animals, such as foreign deer, but that the permit
excluded the native, protected species.
   Records indicated most of the native animals had been brought in
from other states, McKay said. Transporting such an animal across
state lines without a permit violates the federal Lacy Act.
   Conviction on such a charge could bring a penalty of five years
in prison and a $250,000 fine, he said.
   Cottrell said that a brief examination of the records indicated
that between 200 and 300 native animals had been killed at the
preserve.
   The 160-acre preserve had been open for three or four years and
apparently purchased animals from zoos, preserves and at auctions,
officials said.
   Authorities also raided the home and office of the preserve's
owner, Charles B. Bartholomew of Norman, McKay said.
   Norman is about 20 miles south of Oklahoma City in central
Oklahoma. The hunting range was near Bennington, about 200 miles
away.
   Authorities said it would take about a week to sift through the
seized records and determine what federal and state charges to
file, and against whom.
   Besides Bartholomew, authorities are focusing on hunters and
taxidermists named in the receipts.

<HEAD>American Pilot Killed in Gulf Crash Died Without Seeing Son</HEAD>

   An American pilot killed when his F-111
fighter-bomber crashed in Saudi Arabia died without seeing his
4-week-old son.
   Capt. Fredrick Reid, 33, of Harrisburg, Pa., and his weapons
systems officer Capt. Thomas Caldwell, 32, of Columbus, Ohio, were
killed outright when their F-111 went down over the Saudi Arabian
peninsula Wednesday on a training mission.
   Reid's second son, Cody, was born after Reid was sent to the
gulf as part of Operation Desert Shield, the U.S. military response
to Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Reid had been based at the British air force's Lakenheath base
in the eastern English county of Suffolk.
   Reid's tearful wife Vicki, said Friday at their home in Mundford
in neighboring Norfolk county that her husband had lived for flying
and his family.
   She said he had not been afraid of going to join the U.S.-led
international force massing in the gulf.
   ``It was part of his job. He loved flying - that's why he was in
the air force,'' she said.
   ``We were both aware of the danger, but you always think it
won't happen to you.''
   Mrs. Reid said her husband was a calm, strong man. ``He was
outgoing and friendly and we have made a lot of friends here in the
village where we live,'' she said.
   ``He loved adventure and outdoor camping, things like that.''
   Lt. Cmdr. J D van Sickle, a military spokesman, said the
incident was under investigation.
   The F-111 was attached to the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing at
Lakenheath.
   The aircraft was the latest version of a 23-year-old swing-wing
jet that first saw action in Vietnam, he said.

   Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of The Wall Street
Journal, is freezing budgets for capital spending and salaries and
imposing other news and business cutbacks to cope with weak
financial results and the sluggish economy.
   The cuts, announced in an internal memo to managers Thursday,
followed weeks of rumors about a possible retrenchment and
triggered concern over possible future layoffs at the media and
financial industry giant.
   Dow Jones earlier this week announced a 17.5 percent drop in
third-quarter profit, reflecting a steady downturn attributed
principally to the company's acquisition of the financial
information service Telerate Inc.
   Dow Jones also has been hurt by the recession plaguing Wall
Street since the 1987 stock market crash.
   Operating income at Dow Jones' business publications, which
include the Journal and Barron's weekly, dropped 80 percent in the
second quarter. Advertising linage at the Journal dropped 16
percent in the period.
   The internal memo from Dow Jones chairman Warren H. Phillips and
publisher and president Peter R. Kann freezes all capital
expenditures immediately and holds all 1991 department budgets -
including total salary costs - at 1990 levels. Accounting for
inflation, the budget cut would amount to more than 5 percent for
1991.
   The memo, a copy of which was obtained Friday, also said Dow
Jones will reduce management bonuses next year, eliminate all
temporary help, try to eliminate all editorial staff relocations
and reduce space devoted to news in the Journal.
   ``We have no reasons to believe that the deteriorating economic
climate and business results we've been experiencing the past three
months are aberrational,'' the three-page memo said.
   ``It's likely we, like many other companies in our industry,
will be facing adverse market conditions for most of our
publications and services, particularly in the U.S. in 1991,'' it
said. ``Thus it's prudent for us to take steps now to reduce our
costs further.''
   Phillips and Kann said the cuts were ``the preferred method of
trimming our costs structure'' but said they could not guarantee
that they would meet company goals. ``Thus we shouldn't be making
any such promises to employees throughout the company,'' the memo
said.
   The memo did not rule out layoffs, fueling rumors at the Journal
and other Dow Jones units of forced reductions or closings of
advertising locations or news bureaus.
   ``I think what it means is fewer bodies,'' said Ronald Chen, a
Journal copy editor who heads the union representing about 2,000
Dow Jones employees.
   ``Executives say `I don't think attrition is working,' '' Chen
said Friday. ``The only other thing we can think of is forced
departures. That's the kind of thing we see that worries us.''
   Union members earlier this year ratified a three-year contract
providing for pay increases of 5.5 percent this year and 5 percent
a year in 1991 and 1992. Chen said the increases would not be
affected by the announced cuts.
   Dow Jones spokesman Roger May said staff reductions were part of
the company's eventual goal, but that they could be achieved
through reduced hiring, unfilled vacancies and dismissals based on
performance, among other steps. Dow Jones has more than 9,000
full-time employees.
   The memo said the company will continue to accept ``reasonable''
losses on some operations, including overseas editions of the
Journal and Telerate's strugging trading service.
   The memo said Dow Jones will sell its corporate jet and reduce
its aviation staff, and sell excess land purchased for Journal
printing plant expansion and printing presses in storage.
   Among other editorial reductions, the memo said Dow Jones would
reduce Journal special report inserts and table plans for a Journal
magazine among other moves to contain or reduce costs.

   Western diplomatic defiance of Iraq's seizure of Kuwait weakened
Friday when Germany and Belgium announced that their last envoys
had left the occupied nation. A jetliner carrying 257 evacuees from
Kuwait and Iraq landed in North Carolina.
   The Pan Am jet, the first U.S.-chartered flight in nearly three
weeks, landed Friday afternoon at Raleigh-Durham airport with 123
American citizens, six Canadians and others of unknown nationality.
   About 100 of those on the flight from London were under 13,
including a few infants, officials said.
   Also Friday, a French news magazine reported that the U.S.
military has drawn up plans to free Kuwait and defeat Iraq in an
attack next month. A group of Iraqi exiles said Saddam Hussein is
already considering withdrawing from the emirate Iraq overran Aug.
2.
   Iraq, meanwhile, said it may stop Soviet detainees from
returning home if they have knowledge of Iraqi weapons systems. The
evacuation began Sunday and Iraq has promised to let at least 2,000
Soviets leave.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney plans to ask Soviet officials
next week for intelligence data on the Iraqi military, which was
armed largely by the Soviet Union.
   There were signs that Western impatience with the standoff was
growing and that the U.S.-led forces arrayed in Saudi Arabia and
elsewhere in the region could be sent to war to force Iraq from
Kuwait.
   Pentagon sources said a Marine amphibious force was planning a
practice assault on the Arabian coast soon as a trial run for a
possible U.S. invasion of Kuwait. A French magazine reported Friday
that U.S. military officials have drawn up an offensive plan
against Iraq.
   The U.S. forces in the gulf area now total more than 200,000,
including elements of two armored cavalry units that arrived this
week, the Pentagon sources said. Officials indicated the buildup
may be winding down.
   The largest weapon used so far against Iraq has been the trade
embargo imposed by the United Nations.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told her Conservative
Party to be prepared for war if those sanctions fail.
   ``We must hope they work,'' she said in an address at the close
of the party's annual conference in Bournemouth, England. ``If not,
the military option is there.''
   The 5,000 delegates applauded when Mrs. Thatcher said Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein must face war crimes charges, pay
reparation for the devastation of Kuwait and be denied the power to
mount new attacks.
   The French magazine L'Express reported that U.S. military
officials have drawn up plans to free Kuwait and defeat Iraq in a
four-day war in November that would destroy Saddam's armed forces.
   L'Express said it obtained an outline of the plan from an
unidentified adviser to Defense Secretary Cheney. The weekly
publication is a general news magazine, similar to Time or
Newsweek, and has one of the largest circulations in France.
   L'Express said U.S. planners estimated the offensive might cost
20,000 American lives. It gave no estimate for dead of other
nations.
   U.S. officials refused to comment, in line with Pentagon
security rules.
   Saddam has claimed that Kuwait is historically part of Iraq and
has said repeatedly that Iraq will never withdraw.
   However, an Iraqi opposition party-in-exile said the Iraqi
ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party has circulated a questionnaire
asking prominent members whether they believe Iraq should pull out.
   The claim by the Kurdistan Democratic Party-Iraq could not be
independently confirmed. If true, it would represent an
unprecedented quest for consensus by Saddam.
   Saddam has declared Kuwait to be Iraq's 19th province, and Iraqi
forces have encircled and cut off supplies to diplomatic missions
since ordering them closed on Aug. 24.
   Diplomats from nations that oppose the Aug. 2 invasion have
tried to hold out but are slowly abandoning the embassies for lack
of food and intolerable living conditions. Electricty and water
have been shut off to most of them.
   In Bonn, a German Foreign Ministry spokesman said the last
diplomats in the German Embassy drove from Kuwait to Baghdad on
Thursday. ZDF television, a German station, said the group included
the ambassador and his wife, along with three staff members.
   The Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said they had run out of food.
   Belgian officials in Brussels said their remaining two diplomats
also left for Baghdad Thursday.
   That leaves the Americans, British, Canadians and French as the
only holdouts among Western missions.
   In other developments:
   -Saddam Hussein told Iraqi children that President Bush and the
U.N. embargo on Iraq have deprived them of milk and sweets, but
urged them to do without candy to maintain their pride and dignity.
The speech, marking Iraqi Children's Day, was read by an announcer
on Baghdad radio and television.
   -In Cairo, Egypt, gunmen killed the parliament speaker and three
security men outside a downtown hotel. The attack came after the
government warned that terrorists might strike to punish Egypt for
its opposition to Iraq.
   There was no claim of responsibility.
   -Members of Japan's deeply divided parliament hooted at Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu when he opened a special session by asking
for support for his plan to deploy armed forces overseas. Japan has
not sent forces overseas since World War II.

   In their first real head-on battle, NBC's ``The
Cosby Show'' just barely beat the second-season premiere of Fox's
``The Simpsons,'' ratings for the season's big sitcom duel showed
Friday.
   Cosby's show, which has been trouncing reruns of ``The
Simpsons'' since the season began, had an 18.5 national rating
Thursday, just one-tenth of a ratings point higher than the
Nielsens for Fox's bug-eyed, big-toothed cartoon clan.
   In results made public earlier Friday, Fox's show even eat the
Cosby comedy in the 24-city overnight ratings race. But both Fox
and NBC officials said that a Cosby victory was likely when the
national ratings came in.
   ``We'e very pleased,'' Peter Chernin, Fox Entertainment Group
president, said of the ``Simpsons'' ratings. ``We think it's a good
number, a good start for us. It was better than we thought we'd
do.''
   NBC officials also were pleased that The Cos withstood the
challenge from the off-the-wall animated sitcom that had been a hit
for Fox on Sundays, then was shifted to Thursday nights to take on
NBC's long-time ratings champion.
   Fox heavily promoted the start of its new ``Simpsons'' episodes
``and gave it its best shot this week,'' said Preston Beckman, NBC
vice president for audience research. ``But `Cosby' withstood the
onslaught pretty well.''
   The first half-hour of competing network shows Thursday - a
2-hour repeat of the ``Columbo'' movie on ABC and a movie, ``Dark
Avenger,'' on CBS - averaged ratings of 10.6 and 5.4, respectively.
Each ratings point represents 931,000 homes.
   The ratings for Thursday's ``The Simpsons'' were nearly double
those of the previous week, when a rerun was shown. Cosby's show
dropped by a ratings point on Thursday, a comparison with its Oct.
4 ratings showed.
   Chernin avoided speculating on whether he thought ``The
Simpsons'' might eventually beat Cosby's show in the ratings.
   ``We've always said we'd be thrilled to be a strong second, and
we still feel that,'' he said, later adding: ``Honestly, I don't
know where it's going to go. We're just trying to savor today's
happiness and not make predictions.''
   NBC's Beckman also declined to say what he thought were the
chances of ``The Simpsons'' beating ``The Cosby Show'' this season.
   Whether the two shows will continue to be neck-and-neck in the
Nielsens ``I really can't say,'' he insisted. ``This is one of the
most exciting races in television in several years. Time will
tell.''
   ``Give `The Simpsons' its due,'' he added. ``It took on Cosby
and performed well. But basically, Fox has an isolated hit there.''

<HEAD>Russian President Resumes Work After Accident, May Get Safer Car</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin, who made his
political comeback by railing against official privileges, found
himself facing the issue Friday on his first day back at work after
a car crash.
   Yeltsin, limping slightly, officially resumed work at the
Russian republic parliament by opening a committee meeting. He had
been hurt in a road accident Sept. 12 near his office and had been
recovering at home, Tass reported.
   The accident stirred debate in the Russian parliament over
giving the republic leader a special car for safer transportation.
He had been riding in a Soviet-built Volga sedan.
   After the accident, Russian officials ordered four armor-plated
luxury cars for Yeltsin and his prime minister, Ivan Silayev, from
Gorky Auto Works plant. But the plant refused, saying it only made
such cars for national leaders.
   British newspapers last week reported Yeltsin would swap his car
for an armor-plated Mercedes Benz. Russian republic officials
quickly denied the report, saying they had received no such offer.
   The latest wrinkle came Friday, when the labor newspaper Trud
reported the Konaly motor works east of Moscow, which makes armored
vans for banks, has offered to build safe, ``comfortable'' cars for
Yeltsin and his prime minister, Ivan Silayev.
   ``As the recent accident shows, an armor-plated car today is not
only a luxury, but also a means a safe transportation,'' Trud said.
   The newspaper did not say whether Yeltsin accepted the offer,
and Tass did not way whether Yeltsin made any comment about it at
the parliament.
   Yeltsin has stressed his connection with ordinary people by
riding in buses and ordinary cars. Riding a populist appeal, he
made his political comeback this year came after denunciation in
1987 by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for demanding faster
reforms.

<TEXT>
   The leader of the Peasants Party, a group
claiming 2 million members, on Friday announced his candidacy for
president.
   Roman Bartoszcze joins Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa, Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and at least 11 other candidates who
are known to be collecting signatures for a place on the Nov. 25
ballot.
   The candidates must gather 100,000 signatures by Oct. 25 to run
in Poland's first popular presidential election to replace Gen.
Wojciech Jaruzelski, the former Communist Party leader who has
asked Parliament to shorten his term.
   The political camps supporting Walesa and Mazowiecki say they
are close to collecting sufficient signatures.
   The Solidarity chairman and his former adviser, now split over
the pace of reforms, are the leading candidates and polls show them
running nearly even.
   Bartoscze, whose candidacy was approved Friday by his party's
ruling council, is expected to draw a following among farmers
disgruntled about the low prices for agricultural products as the
economic system is overhauled.
   The Peasants Party includes former Rural Solidarity activists as
well as members of the United Peasant Party, which was part of the
coalition led by Solidarity that took power in September 1989.
   Another representative of the peasant movement, Sen. Gabriel
Janowski, was put forward Friday as a candidate. Janowski, a member
of the upper house of Parliament, is Rural Solidarity chairman.

   A man with AIDS forced an 8-year-old
relative to have oral sex, the child and a prosecutor told jurors
Friday in a test case of a new state law.
   Randall Lee Dempsey, 34, of rural Marion is charged with
criminal transmission of the HIV virus and aggravated criminal
sexual assault. He has pleaded innocent to the charges.
   The case is believed the first test of the state's new criminal
HIV transmission law, which took effect Sept. 11, 1989.
   ``This is a classic case of child sex abuse in the family
setting. But there is one unique and quite dangerous element to
this case,'' Williamson County State's Attorney Charles Garnati
said in his opening statement.
   ``He (Dempsey) did so after testing positive for the HIV virus
and he did so after being told by his own doctor that he was
infected with the HIV virus.''
   The defense made no opening statement Friday.
   Under the law, the attacker must know he is carrying the AIDS
virus when he performs an act, such as sexual intercourse, which
would expose someone to the virus. Conviction does not require that
the victim develop AIDS.
   It is not known if the boy has been tested for the virus.
Lawyers say they are bound by state law not to discuss the case
outside the courtroom.
   If convicted, Dempsey faces up to seven years in prison on the
transmission charge and up to 30 years on the assault charge. He
was being held in the Williamson County Jail on $50,000 bond.
   Garnati said Dempsey returned to Marion from California to live
with his parents after becoming ill. Blood tests Dempsey underwent
for the HIV virus in December turned up positive.
   ``The defendant's mother will tell you that the defendant never
really did accept the fact that he was infected with the HIV
virus,'' Garnati told the jury.
   Garnati told jurors that on May 27, the child slept in the same
bed with Dempsey, and that Dempsey forced the youth to have oral
sex against the boy's objections.
   The boy told a relative the next morning, despite Dempsey's
promise to give him a pet turtle to keep quiet, Garnati said.
   ``How did a little 8-year-old boy know how to describe something
like that?'' Garnati asked.
   ``The only conclusion is that he is telling the truth and that
man did it,'' he said, pointing at Dempsey.
   The boy, now 9, answered attorneys with short sentences and
appeared cheerful throughout Friday's testimony.
   In his cross-examination, Public Defender Larry Broeking asked
the boy about statements he made to his father denying that abuse
occurred. But under Garnati's questioning, the child insisted
Dempsey assaulted him.
   After testifying, the boy waved happily to Dempsey and climbed
down from the witness stand.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome cripples the body's defenses
against disease, leaving a person prey to life-threatening
infections and certain cancers.
   The fatal, incurable disease is spread by a virus transmitted
mainly through sexual intercourse, shared hypodermic needles and
from infected mothers to their infants before or during birth.
   In infected people, the AIDS virus is found in blood and semen.

<HEAD>Sharp Cost Increases Feared In Household Products</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's first laws restricting
air pollutants in household goods could force some products off
store shelves and raise the costs of others, manufacturers said
Friday.
   But the state's largest consumer group said Thursday's sweeping
decision by the state Air Resources Board is ``very fair and will
be absorbed into the economy, providing a better quality of life.''
   The board, which enforces air quality standards and sets
emission levels, ordered a 45 percent cut in household
hydrocarbons, the smog-forming pollutants in 16 types of products.
   The products include hair sprays, floor wax, window cleaners,
furniture polish, engine degreasers, tile cleaners, hair mousses
and gels, laundry prewash, insect repellents, aerosol shaving
creams, nail polish removers, oven cleaners, windshield washer
fluids and room air-fresheners.
   The regulations would remove about 45 tons of hydrocarbons daily
from the atmosphere, an amount equivalent to the pollutants spewed
by 1.4 million automobiles, the board said.
   The new rules will be phased in over five years, beginning in
1993, and mark the first time air pollution from household products
has been ordered reduced. The decision also reflects the board's
desire to target consumer-product pollution, a departure from the
panel's traditional role of regulating automobile and industrial
pollution.
   ``We hope we can make the changes in the time required, but in
some cases, we don't know,'' said Ralph Engel, head of the Chemical
Specialties Manufacturers Association. ``It will cause some pain
and it will close some products.''
   Among those that could be forced off the shelves are engine
degreasers and aerosol-propelled air fresheners because technology
is not yet available to enable those products to meet the board's
standards, Engel said.
   His organization represents 426 companies, including
manufacturers of household cleaners, disinfectants, beauty aids and
automotive cleaners - virtually every product covered by the order.
California accounts for about 12 percent of the companies' sales.
   The state estimated the regulations could increase costs from a
penny to 23 cents per product.
   However, Engel said the increases could reach seven times the
board's estimate and other industry reresentatives said the cost
of reformulating the compounds would likely drive retail prices up.
   Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers Union of
California, the state's largest consumers' group, disagreed.
   ``The industry estimates are always 10 times to 100 times higher
than what the additional costs actually are,'' Snyder said.
``Whatever cost increase there is will be absorbed by the economy.
This is the kind of thing consumers have been asking for and are
willing to pay for.''
   The chemical industry ``can't figure a way to make money off
these regulations. None of them have been willing to sell safety,''
he said.
   The regulations, the most comprehensive in the nation, stem from
a 1988 California law requiring a crackdown on hydrocarbons in
consumer goods.
   For example, hair spray - the largest producer of household
hydrocarbons - has an average hydrocarbon content of about 94
percent for aerosol sprays and 70 percent for pump sprays. By 1998,
the maximum level of hydrocarbons allowed in hair sprays would be
55 percent.
   Windshield washer fluids have the second-highest rate and room
air-fresheners the third.
   Products in the 16 categories emit about 100 tons of
hydrocarbons a day. The board's ruling would reduce those emissions
to about 45 tons by 1998.

   Animal activists protesting a
state-sponsored deer hunt this weekend will challenge a new
hunter-harassment law by making noise to try to frighten off the
deer, their attorney said.
   ``We think it should be proper to make noises in order to alert
the deer of possible harm,'' Boca Raton lawyer Barry Silver said
Thursday.
   The activists, who have a state permit to gather on a roadside,
also will protest the permit's noise restrictions, which Silver
said violate free-speech rights.
   The activists were to gather Saturday outside the Camp Blanding
Wildlife Management Area while the hunters are inside. The annual
Youth Deer Hunt, in which parents and guardians teach children aged
8 to 15 to hunt safely, is sponsored by the state's Game and Fresh
Water Fish Commission.
   Lt. Jim Huffstodt of the game commission said protesters will be
in a designated area about one-quarter to one-half mile from the
nearest hunting site.
   Huffstodt said game officers will enforce a state law that took
effect on Oct. 1 that prohibits interfering with hunting, trapping
and fishing and disturbing fish and game animals.
   Silver said the protesters consider the law vague,
unconstitutional and unfair. ``It seems to us unfair not to be able
to protect an animal but perfectly legal to destroy it,'' he said.
   The protesters are seeking to challenge restrictions placed on a
permit they received from the Florida Department of Transportation.
   Don Quilio, the department's assistant district maintenance
engineer in Lake City, said he was surprised to learn that the
permit prohibited shouting and would remove that restriction if the
protesters ask him to do so.
   But he said he stands by the restrictions against noisemakers
and ``any type of noise pollution'' because airhorns and other
unusual noises could confuse drivers of passing vehicles.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein told his
country's children Friday that President Bush is depriving them of
milk and sweets, but urged them to maintain their pride and
dignity.
   In a speech read by an announcer on Baghdad radio and
television, Saddam said Bush was behind a supposed milk and sugar
shortage in Iraq, placed under a U.N.-sanctioned trade embargo
following its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   ``We can cope, but what's most important is our pride and
dignity,'' Saddam was quoted by the unidentified announcer.
   The statement, monitored in Nicosia, said Bush was trying to
turn Iraqi children into slaves and control their future ``to
satisfy world Zionism.''
   Iraqi authorities have claimed there is a milk shortage, but
Western journalists who visited Baghdad recently say stores are
well stocked with milk.
   Saddam was speaking on the eve of Iraqi Children's Day, which
commemorates the deaths of 39 Iraqi schoolchildren on Oct. 13,
1987, when an Iranian surface-to-surface missile hit their school
in Baghdad's Dora district.

<HEAD>Hunter Describes `Anguished Cry' in Shooting of Woman Mistaken for
Deer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A supermarket manager unleashed a
``terrible, anguished cry'' after he shot a woman he apparently
mistook for a deer, his hunting companion testified Friday.
   Donald Rogerson, the manager of a supermarket produce
department, was hunting in the woods behind Karen Wood's suburban
home on Nov. 15, 1988. Thinking he saw a deer, he fired his rifle.
Mrs. Wood was hit in the chest and died.
   A grand jury cleared Rogerson, but a second grand jury indicted
him on a manslaughter charge. He went on trial Tuesday in Penobscot
County Superior Court in Bangor, and has pleaded innocent.
   The prosecution contends Rogerson acted negligently or
recklessly when he shot Mrs. Wood, 37, who was standing behind her
home in the Bangor suburb of Hermon. She had just moved from Iowa
to Maine with her husband and year-old twin girls.
   Authorities said Rogerson was about 180 feet from her when he
fired. Defense attorneys contend the shooting was an accident.
   The case triggered a fierce public debate over hunting in a
state where 216,476 people bought hunting licenses last year and
30,260 deer were killed. Peter Anderson said he was hunting a short
distance from Rogerson when he heard a shot and, moments later,
heard ``a terrible, terrible anguished cry.''
   ``I heard cries of, ``Oh No! No!'' Anderson said.
   Anderson said he ran over and saw Rogerson kneeling beside Mrs.
Wood. He quoted Rogerson as saying: ``I've shot a human being. Oh
God. Why does God allow this to happen??''
   Anderson said he was afraid Rogerson was so distraught he might
try to kill himself with his rifle.
   He also quoted Rogerson as saying, ``Why did she have to have
white mittens? I saw white mittens. I thought it was a (deer)
flag.''
   On Thursday, prosecutors introduced into evidence the mittens
found near Mrs. Wood's body. Inspector Gary Sargent of the Maine
Warden Service identified the mittens, which are white with brown
leather palms, and said they were about the same size as an
upraised deer tail.
   But he added that they were only ``about half'' the size of the
white area that is visible on the backside of a running deer, which
comprises both the underside of the tail and the animal's rump.

<HEAD>Rural Backyard Dishes Favored in Cable TV Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new proposed compromise for re-regulating
cable TV would require the industry to sell network programs to
some 3 million mostly rural owners of backyard satellite dishes,
its Senate sponsors said Friday.
   Providing details of an accord negotiated over the past two
weeks, Sens. Al Gore, D-Tenn., and Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., said
cable networks could still restrict their programs to subscribers
of local cable distributors.
   But Gore said the compromise also now includes ``critical
language protecting the backyard home satellite dish market'' - a
provision that cable operators have vigorously fought the past
eight years.
   ``The war for satellite television dish owners has been won,''
Gore said.
   However, he acknowledged that the bill could still be stymied in
the waning days of the 101st Congress by objections from ``no more
than a handful of colleagues'' and the Bush administration.
   ``To those who would continue to block its consideration on
behalf of the cable industry or the White House, I would only say
that such a move would backfire,'' he said, threatening to sponsor
a tougher bill next year.
   Wirth said ``some of the provisions ... very damaging to the
cable industry, which is headquartered in Denver'' were changed in
the compromise after the bill was pulled from the Senate floor last
month in response to his threat of a filibuster then.
   ``I'm not happy with every aspect of it, but important
concessions were made on both sides and I believe the result is
both workable and fair,'' he said.
   Wirth described the new provision on backyard satellite dishes
as a recognition that their primarily rural market is in ``areas
that cable and broadcasters cannot now serve and are unlikely to be
able to serve in the future.''
   Both the Senate bill and a similar measure passed by the House
last month would require cable operators to provide a ``basic
tier'' of service - local and public TV stations plus
government-access channels - at rates to be regulated by the
Federal Communications Commission.
   Rates for cable network programs such as Cable News Network, MTV
or ESPN would not be regulated unless anticompetitive abuses could
be demonstrated. Rates for premium programming such as Home Box
Office and Cinemax would remain deregulated.
   The legislation is a response to many consumer complaints about
excessive rates and poor service in many areas after the industry
was deregulated by Congress in 1986.

<HEAD>Morocco Supports Saddam's Linking Kuwait to Palestinian Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RABAT, Morocco (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Hassan II on Friday showed support
for Saddam Hussein's efforts to link the Palestinian uprising to
any Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
   He told Parliament the Iraqi president had succeeded in linking
the two issues in international opinion and that this gives Saddam
an ``honorable way'' to pull his troops out of Kuwait without
losing face.
   ``This step is sufficient and has woken up the international
conscience about a solution to the Palestinian problem,'' Hassan
said.
   Iraq invaded the small, oil-rich emirate on Aug. 2.
   The monarch urged Saddam not to push the link too far. He
advised him to rapidly pull out of Kuwait while settling for a
``moral engagement'' by the world regarding the Palestinians.
   ``Thus, the Iraqi president will spare the Arab nation a war
that will destroy not only its military potential but its economic,
industrial and agriculture infrastructure,'' the king said.
   Hassan said Israel would profit from such a war.
   Morocco is one of the few Arab countries to have contributed
troops - a token deployment of 1,200 men - to the U.S.-led
multinational force defending Saudi Arabia and tightening the
United Nations embargo against Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   Saddam and the Palestine Liberation Organization have said any
withdrawal from Kuwait must be accompanied by an Israeli pullout
from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, captured by Israel from
Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   The demands gained heightened world interest this week after
Israeli police killed 19 Palestinian rioters and wounded 140 at the
Temple Mount in Jerusalem, sacred to both Jews and Moslems.
   Arab League sources reported Friday that Morocco agreed to a PLO
call for an urgent meeting next week to discuss a common Arab
response to the killings.

<HEAD>Hospital Will Investigate Birth to Woman Refused Help</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hospital said Friday it was reviewing an
incident in which a mentally ill woman gave birth in a tree planter
after being kicked out of an emergency room because she was causing
a disturbance.
   ``We're reviewing the case, and it's probably going to take a
little while because it involved more than one agency,'' D.C.
General Hospital spokeswoman Ann Chisholm said.
   Hospital officials declined further comment.
   Two police officers who heard Priscilla Jones screaming in the
tree planter early Sept. 9 helped her give birth to a 3-pound,
5-ounce boy, police said.
   The homeless woman had falsely claimed to be pregnant on many
occasions over the last three or four years, according to Victoria
Roberts, administrator of Luther Place shelter where Jones
sometimes lived.
   Jones is heavy-set, known for violent outbursts and frequent
claims of pregnancy, and it may not have been apparent she was
pregnant.
   ``No one believed her, even most of our workers, until a month
before she actually delivered when we had a sonogram done,''
Roberts said.
   The night before the birth, Jones walked to the shelter in
obvious distress, Roberts said.
   ``It was very obvious she was in labor,'' she said. ``The two
women who called an ambulance told them that her contractions were
about five minutes apart. What we don't know is whether the
ambulance crew conveyed that information to the hospital.''
   Jones has lived on the streets for about 10 years. Her violent
rages and pregnancy claims probably are known to employees of a
number of groups who operate services for the homeless, several
police officers, and possibly the paramedics to arrived to help,
Roberts said.
   ``The ambulance drivers probably recognized her. We've had to
call police because she has been violent in the past,'' she said.
   Emergency room officials escorted her out after she began
screaming. Jones walked about a block and gave birth, Roberts said.
   Sgt. Joseph Goodwin and Officer Patricia Newkirk were driving by
in their patrol car when they heard the woman's shrieks, police
said. After the baby was born, they took the woman and child back
to the hospital, where they were admitted.
   The baby remained at D.C. General on Friday, and Luther Place
workers were trying to convince Jones to move into the shelter,
Robert said.
   ``She is severely ill and very resistant to help and this has
been very traumatic for her,'' she said. ``Clearly mistakes have
been made. We have a health care system that is simply overloaded
and not able to deal with the reality of the situation.''
   Several weeks before the birth, shelter officials had arranged
to have Jones committed to St. Elizabeths Hospital because they
were concerned she would harm the fetus. Hospital workers arrived
too late, however, Roberts said.
   ``They arrived the Monday after the Saturday night she
delivered,'' Robert said.

   The Soviet government Friday announced it was
taking urgent steps to fight organized crime and black
marketeering, which have spread rapidly as private businesses have
opened across the country.
   The decree by the Council of Ministers, or cabinet, said law
enforcement agencies will receive better ``material and technical
supplies'' and new staff, the official Soviet news agency Tass
reported.
   In addition, special units of the KGB will be set up to combat
organized crime, and a law enforcement center will be established
to coordinate the activities of the KGB, Interior Ministry police
and other agencies.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had promised on Wednesday that he
would propose ``tough measures that will represent a powerful
weapon in the hands of law enforcers and authorities.''
   As Gorbachev has edged the country from a centrally planned to a
market-based economy, protection rackets have preyed on fledgling
small businesses. Black marketeers have also dealt in an
ever-widening circle of goods, ranging from cigarettes at $5 a pack
to personal computers at $42,500.
   The decree appeared aimed at such activity, which is widely
resented by ordinary citizens who scrape by on salaries averaging
$425 a month.
   But it also seemed to be part of a conservative backlash against
economic reforms and an attempt to inject discipline into the
crumbling central planning system.
   Many Soviet entrepreneurs operate in legal gray areas, buying
materials at subsidized state prices and selling finished products
for as much money as people will pay.
   Such activity would be legal in Westen countries, but is
branded as speculation or profiteering by some Soviet officials.
   The decree could bring a crackdown on numerous cooperative
businesses, from restaurants to dressmakers and small construction
firms, which buy and sell goods without government approval.
   On Sept. 27, Gorbachev issued a related decree threatening to
fine businesses that fail to fulfill goverment contracts. The move
was widely viewed by Soviets as an attempt to bolster the central
planning system at a time when many factories and farms are trying
to bypass Moscow and trade directly with each other.
   Gorbachev's initiatives have sometimes appeared contradictory.
He has both advocated transition to a market system and tried to
keep the old economic system running. He has declared allegiance to
``the socialist ideal'' while also calling himself a ``radical''
and a ``pragmatist.''
   Tass provided few details on the law and order decree. It did
not say how many personnel would be added to law enforcement
agencies, whether the agencies' budgets would rise, or what tactics
they would use.

   A former restaurant owner involved in
litigation over a $350,000 Mercedes-Benz Pullman car once owned by
John Lennon was sentenced Friday to 15 months in prison for money
laundering.
   Edward Murphy, 44, pleaded guilty in August to violating federal
currency reporting requirements. He admitted his girlfriend bought
cashier's checks at six St. Louis area banks to avoid reporting
transactions exceeding $10,000.
   Murphy, who once owned the American Cafe in St. Louis, was
sentenced by U.S. District Judge John Nangle.
   Murphy used the cashier's checks to wire $45,000 in April 1988
from Mercantile Trust in St. Louis to London as payment of legal
fees connected with the litigation, U.S. Attorney Stephen Higgins
said.
   Ownership of the car was being challenged by former Supremes
singer Mary Wilson.
   The car was sold by a repair shop in Basingstoke near London for
$3,750 in 1982, two years after Ms. Wilson and her ex-husband,
Pedro Ferrar, left it there for repairs.
   The car passed through several owners before Nick Miranda, a
former St. Louis used car dealer, bought it in December 1984. Ms.
Wilso won repossession of the car in 1988.

   The Security Council reached broad
agreement Friday night on a resolution condemning Israel for the
police killing of 19 Palestinians and asking a U.N. investigation
into the deaths, diplomats said.
   Colombian Ambassador Enrique Penalosa, a member of the Security
Council, said ``there is general agreement on a resolution,'' and
that members hoped for a meeting and vote soon.
   ``We expect a unanimous vote,'' said Yemeni Ambassador Mohammed
Abdulaziz Sallam. ``We are pleased with the condemnation and the
call for action.''
   Informal, closed consultations were delayed while delegates
sought approval from their governments on the latest draft.
   The agreement would avert a U.S. veto of a harsher PLO
resolution condemning Israel and would preserve the fragile U.S-led
coaltion against Iraq that would have been jeopardized by a U.S.
veto.
   The accord, reached after five days of marathon negotiations and
U.S. lobbying, indicated the non-aligned movement had split on the
issue and was not wholehertedly in the camp of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   The PLO said it still objected to the latest draft, one of at
least four documents the past four days, but the PLO appeared to be
isolated.
   The PLO resisted a moderate draft resolution backed by the
United States, Britain and others, which condemned Israel's use of
force on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem last Monday but also
parceled out blame to Palestinian stone-throwers.
   Palestinians on the mount were hurling rocks down on Jews
praying at the Western Wall, or Wailing Wall, when police
intervened and later began shooting.
   The draft resolution also asked the U.N. secretary-general to
send a mission to investigate the violence and report its
conclusions about ensuring the safety of Palestinians in the
occupied territories.
   ``It's time to fish or cut bait,'' U.S. Ambassador Thomas R.
Pickering told reporters Friday on entering the council chamber.
   The United States was bent on avoiding using its veto power,
fearing a veto could endanger U.S. credibility in the Arab world
and undermine the U.S.-led coalition against Iraq.
   Its drafting of a tough resolution condemning Israeli security
forces was a rare gesture against its Israeli ally and marked a
significant shift. America commonly shields Israel in the Security
Council by vetoing condemnations.
   The PLO rejected the U.S. resolution as too weak and insisted
there be no criticism of Palestinian stone-throwers.
   It initially sought a three-man Security Council mission that
would make recommendations on how to protect Palestinians in the
occupied territories.
   Israel had rejected such a mission in advance as infringing on
its sovereignty.
   The Security Council includes five permanent members with veto
power: the United States, Britain, China, France and the Soviet
Union. The 10 other members are Canada, Colombia, Cuba, Ethiopia,
Finland, Ivory Coast, Malaysia, Romania, Yemen, Zaire.

<HEAD>Right-Wing French Leader Asks Troops to Ponder Why They're in Gulf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jean Marie Le Pen, leader of the extreme right-wing
National Front Party, sent an open letter Friday to French troops
in the Persian Gulf region asking them to consider why they are
there.
   ``For what reasons have our troops intervened far from our
borders when our vital interests are not threatened?'' wrote Le
Pen, a paratrooper in the Algerian war for independence in the
1950s.
   President Francois Mitterrand has dispatched about 13,000 French
soldiers, airmen and sailors to the gulf to enforce the U.N.
embargo against Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   ``The contrast between the insufficience, not to say mediocrity,
of your salaries compared to the opulence of the Arab potentates
and international companies for whom you've been sent to fight
shocks many French people,'' Le Pen told the soldiers.
   Le Pen, who favors expelling Moslem immigrants from France, has
been one of the few major French political figures to criticize
Mitterrand's policy in the gulf.
   Political observers believe Le Pen hopes to pick up support if
the gulf crisis becomes a greater burden for France. The National
Front has scored about 15 percent in national opinion polls.

<HEAD>Senate Would Transform Cambodia Aid to Open Funds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate late Friday approved $20 million in
new U.S. humanitarian aid to Cambodia, an apparent replacement for
the past policy of covert aid to rebels fighting the Phnom Penh
government.
   Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren, D-Okla.,
argued that aid to non-communist resistance forces should be given
openly and through humanitarian channels.
   ``It is ... healthy for us to provide this aid in this form,''
Boren said. ``This is a policy question that should not be
discussed behind closed doors. ... It givss us an opportunity to
involve the American people in an open public discussion of this
matter.''
   Boren's committee voted earlier this year to end the $13 million
program of covert aid to the non-communist resistance, which is
allied with the dreaded Khmer Rouge in seeking to oust the
Vietnam-backed communist government.
   The Khmer Rouge ran Cambdodia from 1975 until its government was
ousted by a Vietnamese invasion in 1979. It killed more than a
million of its own citizens.
   ``There is a strong likelihood that in the past some of the
funds from the United States may have been used, directly or
indirectly, to benefit the Khmer Rouge, and it's time we had
restrictions that are enforceable,'' Boren said.
   Opponents of current U.S. policy say the covert aid has helped
improve the fortunes of the Khmer Rouge.
   ``This is the killing fields,'' said Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.
``The Khmer Rouge are still an active organization with Pol Pot
(their ruthless leader) still in control. And their methods, if
anything, have become more sophisticated in their evil.''
   The $20 million aid figure apparently was arrived at by
combining the $13 million covert program with a $7 million overt
humanitarian program.
   Senators added the Cambodia aid directive to a $15.3 billion
foreign aid bill for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 as they
began sorting through a series of proposed amendments.
   Work on the bill was not expected to be completed until Monday,
and then it must go to a House-Senate conference committee to work
out differences between competing versions.
   At the same time, the Senate also voted to strip from the bill a
provision that would have given $15 million to the United Nations
population fund, an agency which conducts family planning programs
in 138 countries worldwide.
   On a vote of 51-38, the Senate failed to come up with the 60
votes needed to cut off a filibuster threatened by abortion
opponents. They contended that the U.N. agency should get no money
because it operates in China, whose one-child-per-family policy
leads to forced abortions and sterilizations.
   ``The United States should not be involved either directly or
indirectly with such grievous violations of human rights,'' argued
Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.
   President Bush vetoed last year's version of the foreign aid
bill over a similar provision, forcing Congress to back down.

   Nearly 260 Americans and other refugees
from Kuwait ended a long and tiring odyssey Friday, some rejoicing
as the plane landed on native soil while others began searching for
a new homeland.
   As Hurricane Lili churned off the North Carolina coast, the
chartered Pan Am Boeing 747 dubbed the Clipper Wild Wave touched
down about 4:40 p.m.
   Of the 257 refugees aboard, state officials said there were 123
American citizens, seven Canadians, and the rest were of unknown
nationality. They included two young girls who had not seen their
mother for more than 10 weeks.
   ``When the plane touched down in North Carolina, I hollered so
loud `Thank God I'm in freedom city,''' said Mohammad Issa, a U.S.
citizen of Jordanian descent who was accompanied by his wife and
parents.
   The first group off the plane were woman in Middle Eastern garb,
such as flowing robes and veils, carrying sleeping children and
some personal belongings as they came down the ramp. North Carolina
National Guardsmen escorted other children of varying ages off the
plane.
   A number of young men in casual clothes and men in business
suits also were on board.
   Issa said his family's journey by bus from Kuwait to the Iraqi
capital, Baghdad, was the ``most miserable trip we've ever taken.
There was no food. A trip that was supposed to take 1{ hours, maybe
two, took 14 hours.''
   ``They were trying to break us down mentally, to make us suffer
some,'' said Issa, a former U.S. Marine once stationed at Camp
Lejeune, N.C.
   Two girls on the plane, ages 4 and 6, were reunited with their
mother, who left Kuwait on Aug. 1 to visit her father in Chicago.
Iraq invaded Kuwait the next day.
   ``When they came through the door, that was one relieved
mother,'' said Joe Dean, secretary of the North Carolina Department
of Crime Control and Public Safety. ``They were clinging to their
mother about as tight as you could cling to your mama. And she was
clinging to them about as tight.''
   The woman's husband, an oil engineer and Kuwaiti citizen, was
not permitted to travel with their children.
   The flight arrived in London on Thursday night, where passengers
spent the night before completing the final leg of thir journey
away from the crisis in the Middle East.
   All qualified for the evacuation flight because they were either
citizens or family members of citizens of the United States or
Canada. About 100 of those on the flight are under age 13,
including a few infants who are newborn or nearly newborn,
officials said.
   Officials with the state Division of Emergency Management said
three on board would be in wheelchairs.
   It was the fourth refugee flight from Iraq and Kuwait to land at
Raleigh-Durham, where one terminal has been vacant for more than a
year because of airline industry consolidations.
   The terminal ``has lots of room,'' said Renee Hoffman,
spokeswoman for the North Carolina Department of Crime Control and
Public Safety. ``Some of the other terminals used at other
locations were regular terminals so it was very crowded. Since
we've got this terminal dedicated to the repatriation, it goes very
smoothly.''
   Ms. Hoffman said it normally takes four to six hours to process
the refugees and send them on their way to other flights or hotels.
   The terminal includes a customs area, a cafeteria, a medical
area, a bank, loan officers from the federal government, airline
reservation personnel, and a media room for those who want to speak
to reporters. The news media aren't allowed to go into the terminal
while refugees are there.

   The Soviet KGB helped spark last year's
revolutions in Eastern European to put pro-Gorbachev, reform
Communists in power, former KGB double agent Oleg Gordievsky said
Friday.
   But the secret agents and their Communist Party bosses never
expected the outpouring of anti-Communist fervor that followed, and
they were helpless to stop it, he said.
   ``Here they just lost because they wanted it to stop and it was
impossible to stop the momentum, it was too late,'' said
Gordievsky, who worked as a double agent for 13 years until he
defected to Britain in 1985.
   Gordievsky did not say where he learned about the alleged KGB
involvement in Eastern Europe's tumult. He said he regularly meets
U.S. government officials and analysts and is a consultant of the
journal ``Intelligence and National Security.''
   Dressed immaculately in a double-breasted suit, the bespectacled
Gordievsky, who turned 52 on Wednesday, was without his red-haired
wig and beard disguise, a security precaution to foil would-be KGB
assassins.
   In an interview at a London hotel, he talked animatedly about
his defection, which sparked a tit-for-tat expulsion of 31 Soviet
and 31 British diplomats, trade representatives and journalists.
   Despite the goodwill of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's
perestroika and glasnost, Gordievsky would still face a death
sentence in the Soviet Union.
   ``The feelings of irritation, evil and unpleasant feelings of
jealousy and revenge in the KGB and among other traditional Soviet
Communist apparatchiks is still the same,'' he said.
   Gordievsky, who said his father and brother were both KGB
agents, became a double agent for the British while posted in
Copenhagen in the early 1970s, he said, as a result of his
disillusionment over the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   ``I knew that all the purges, all the brutal, brutal repressions
were true. What Khrushchev said in his secret speech to the 20th
Party Congress was just the tip of the iceberg. Incredible crimes
had been committed,'' Gordievsky said.
   The former spy was transferred to London, becoming one of the
top KGB agents in Britain until he was recalled to Moscow and
questioned about his activities.
   Gordievsky eluded his KGB tail and escaped to the West, where he
has co-authored ``KGB: The Inside Story'' to be published in
Britain and the United States on Oct. 19.
   ``The KGB looked to Gorbachev to provide the dynamism and
discipline necessary to break out of the Soviet Union's economic
stagnation and establish a stable correlation of forces with the
West,'' said excerpts of the book that appeared in Saturday's issue
of The Times.
   ``In the months before (Communist Party General Secretary
Konstantin) Chernenko's long-expected death in March 1985, the KGB
put great care into briefing Gorbachev in a way that would allow
him to impress the rest of the Politburo with his grasp of Soviet
and world affairs.
   ``His election as general secretary in March 1985 was not, of
course, due wholly or even mainly to support from the KGB. But the
center (the KGB's Moscow headquarters) saw the election,
nonetheless, as a major victory.''
   The book's co-author, Cambridge University historian Christopher
Andrew, said despite Soviet attempts to discredit Gordievsky, he
was in a unique position to know what went on inside Lubyanka, the
KGB's headquarters.
   ``Oleg Kalugin, the youngest general in the KGB first chief
directorate, said Gordievsky carried away from the first chief
directorate virtually everything that could be carried away ...
it's a metaphor for simply saying he knew a helluva lot,'' Andrew
said in an interview.
   ``KGB: The Inside Story,'' reportedly reveals KGB involvement in
the shooting down of the Korean Airlines Flight 007 in 1983, which
killed 269 people.
   Andrew said Gordievsky was in London at the time and received a
series of KGB instructions about the incident.
   The book reportedly identifies some key U.S. officials who
worked, sometimes unwittingly, for the KGB and the identity of the
infamous fifth man. It is widely believed that a fifth spy worked
with Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, Anthony Blunt and Kim Philby,
prominent Britons who were recruited by the KGB from Cambridge
University.
   Gordievsky said the fifth man was a member of the British
intelligence community.

   Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble,
who guided negotiations of the treaty that linked the two German
states, was shot and seriously wounded late Friday at a campaign
gathering, police said.
   Schaeuble, 48, was struck by two bullets in the head and chest
and seriously wounded, but his life was not immediately in danger,
Interior Ministry spokesman Roland Bachmeier said. Other reports
said one bullet hit Schaeuble in the neck.
   Police arrested a 37-year-old suspect who ``comes from the
criminal drug scene,'' the ZDF television network reported.
   The Interior Ministry in Bonn said the gunman had been
undergoing treatment for schizophrenia. ARD television identified
him only as Dieter K., and said he used a revolver in the shooting.
   Ralf Krueger, head of the Baden-Wuerttemberg state criminal
office, said there was no evidence the suspect had a terrorist
background, and that he probably acted alone. Police denied an
early report that two others involved in the 10 p.m. shooting had
fled.
   Schaeuble is a member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's inner circle
and was considered a possible successor to the chancellor. As
interior minister he was responsible for many police functions,
including drug probes, but not investigating terrorism.
   The attack, at a restaurant in Oppenau, in the Offenburg
district outside Freiburg in southwest Germany, was the most
serious incident since East and West Germany reunited on Oct. 3.
   Schaeuble was rushed to the hospital in Offenburg for treatment,
about 9 miles west of where the attack took place, police said.
   A security guard who threw himself in front of Schaeuble was
wounded in the stomach, according to the Interior Ministry.
   Schaeuble was named interior minister by Kohl in April 1989,
replacing former minister Eduard Zimmermann. Previously Schaeuble
was Kohl's chief of staff.
   A popular, boyish-looking figure, he has been a member of Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union Party since 1966, and a strong backer of
Kohl's successful efforts to unite the two Germanys.
   Following his smooth handling of negotiations that led up to
unification, Schaeuble had been tipped as a future Christian
Democrat candidate for chancellor.
   Many Germans recall Schaeuble's emotional announcement to
Parliament last Nov. 30 that Deutsche Bank chief Alfred Herrhausen,
the nation's top banker, had been killed in a bomb blast.
   Violent attacks on top politicians have been rare in postwar
German history, although top businessmen have been terrorist
targets.
   Schaeuble is said to be one of Germany's most heavily protected
politicians.
   After the shooting, the suspect was wrestled to the ground by
members of the minister's entourage until he could be handcuffed by
police, according to ARD.
   It quoted a Munich-based journalist at the scene as saying
Schaeuble was able to speak before being taken to the hospital.
   One of Schaeuble's teen-aged daughters witnessed the attack,
said Olga Piess, who was at the restaurant.
   The shooting was the most serious attack on a public figure in
Germany since April 25, when an apparently deranged woman stabbed
Social Democratic leader Oskar Lafontaine in the neck during a
campaign stop in Cologne.
   Lafontaine, Kohl's leading challenger in the December election,
returned to the campaign trail after leaving the hospital weeks
later.

   A disgruntled former employee opened fire
at a car dealership Friday, killing a fellow auto mechanic and the
general manager and wounding another man before turning the gun on
himself, police said.
   Employees said Wilton Reed, 25, of Baltimore, was fired
Wednesday when he refused to work on a car that had been returned
to the dealership's service shop.
   Baltimore County police spokesman Jay Miller said Reed walked
into the service shop just before noon, and fired on his former
co-workers with a 9mm pistol.
   A veteran mechanic, Robert Daughton, 35, was killed outright,
and the general manager of the dealership, William Bishop, 46, died
of his injuries several hours later at University of Maryland Shock
Trauma Center in Baltimore.
   The service manager, John David Laird, 35, who fired Reed,
remained in critical condition at the hospital Friday night, Miller
said.
   ``He seemed like a friendly enough guy ... I guess something
just snaps in a person,'' said employee Kim Miller, 25. ``From what
I heard, he had problems with his girlfriend. I guess they were
engaged to be married and she broke off the engagement two weeks
ago.''
   Reed refused to work on a car that had been returned to the
dealership, telling Laird he had not worked on it the first time,
several mechanics said. Reed was told he had to work on the car on
his own time, and when he refused, he was fired, Miller said.
   Reed methodically shot the three before killing himself,
employees said.
   Reed had a casual conversation with one of the employees when he
first walked in, Miller said. The employee noticed Reed was wearing
a suit and tie and asked him if he had come to pick up his last
paycheck, he said.
   Reed told the employee he wasn't there to pick up his last check
and walked into the bay area, where there were 18 mechanics
working. He walked to Bishop's office and shot him, turned and shot
Laird and walked to the fourth service bay where he shot Daughton
in the head.
   Reed pointed the gun at a customer who was standing next to
Daughton, but the customer ducked behind a car, Miller said.
   Employees at the dealership described Reed as a friendly
co-worker who had worked at the dealership for two years.

   The space shuttle Atlantis, grounded
for over seven months, emerged from its hangar Friday evening in
preparation for a launch next month.
   The shuttle, strapped atop a giant crawler-transporter, began
its methodical six-hour journey to its launch pad 3.4 miles away.
   Once in place Saturday morning, NASA crews will make final
preparations for Atlantis' launch on Nov. 7 or Nov. 8, carrying a
Defense Department satellite into space.
   The launch had originally been scheduled for July 9 but was
canceled when technicians discovered a liquid hydrogen leak in the
craft. Unable to stop the leak, Atlantis was rolled back into the
Vehicle Assembly Building.
   Technicians eventually traced the source of the leak to a
17-inch diameter plumbing line, which had contaminated seals.
   After repairing the leak, shuttle crews began to reassemble the
craft, but were interrupted by another setback. A 70-pound
scaffolding beam, left by workers in the engine compartment,
damaged fuel lines as the orbiter was hoisted upright.
   NASA spokesman Bruce Buckinghm said NASA will test the fuel
systems of the shuttle within the next couple of weeks to ensure
their safety.
   Atlantis' last flight, also on a secret Defense Department
mission, was Feb. 28 to March 4.
   Atlantis' sister ship Columbia is scheduled to roll to its
launch pad Saturday night for a flight in December.

   A 3-year-old Texas girl unable to digest food
was discharged from the hospital Friday, nearly three months after
undergoing a liver and small intestine transplant.
   On her return home, her first meal, of all things, was airplane
food.
   Tracey Kay Gonzales, of Corpus Christi, received a new liver and
small intestine in a 14-hour operation in July. Her doctors say her
success will clear the way for transplants on others with
life-threatening intestinal defects.
   The toddler's quick recovery won her a trip home. She left the
hospital early Friday and, after weeks of hospital food and an
occasional meal away from the medical center, she graduated to
airline food.
   ``She'll eat anything,'' said Tracey's mother, Pam. ``Most of
the time, she's talking about food: `Take me here or take me there
to eat.'''
   Bessie Peters, in the billing department of the airline's
caterer, said passengers aboard Tracey's plane were served omelets
with cheddar cheese or turkey, muffins or croissants and orange
juice and milk.
   When she arrived at the Corpus Christi airport, Tracey rushed to
see her two brothers, Gary, 10 and Tommy, 8, whom she last saw in
April.
   She told them the first thing she wanted to do was to play
football. However, doctors have said Tracey will not be able to
play contact sports.
   Before undergoing surgery, the girl suffered from short gut
syndrome, in which the small intestine was too short to process
food sufficiently. She sustained liver damage on a high-protein
diet fed intravenously.
   ``Before the transplant, she was eating. She has taste buds. Her
body just couldn't do anything with it,'' Children's Hospital
spokeswoman Sue Cardillo said Friday.
   Tracey will return to Pittsburgh on Oct. 21 to begin outpatient
treatment.
   While she's home, doctors will watch for signs of infection or
rejection. Tracey is taking the experimental drug FK-506, which
doctors say is safer and more potent than the common anti-rejection
drug cyclosporin.
   The drug made Tracey's operation possible, and the survival of
two other transplant patients on FK-506 will make surgery possible
for others, said transplant pioneer Dr. Thomas Starzl.
   ``The bottom line is that intestinal transplants are going to be
practical and are going to be widely used,'' Starzl said.
   Small-intestine transplants have a poor success rate. Since
1983, one adult and three children have died within a year of their
surgeries at Pittsburgh hospitals. One adult and a teen-ager are
still alive.
   The small intestine transplanted into Tracey works just like her
own would have if it had been healthy, with muscles moving the food
down the digestive tract.
   ``It's a little bit surprising. There were studies that
suggested that that might not be possible,'' Starzl said.
   While she had her dysfunctional old liver, Tracey retained water
and looked chubby Thursday night at the hospital. Dr. Jorge Reyes
said doctors would gauge Tracey's recovery by the amount of water
loss and muscle gain.
   ``Part of the assessment is to see how her swelling is coming
down and how her lean muscle mass is building up,'' said Reyes,
another of the girl's surgeons.
   Since the surgery is new, it's difficult to measure progress, he
said.
   ``Her postoperative time was relatively uneventful and she
recovered in good time, but there's really nothing for a base to
compare it to,'' Reyes said.

   Gunmen killed the parliament speaker and
four security men outside a luxury hotel Friday, days after the
government warned that terrorists might strike to punish Egypt for
its opposition to Iraq.
   There was no claim of responsibility. Officials said they
suspected either Moslem fundamentalists or terrorists from Iraq.
   Police stepped up security in Cairo and put airports on alert
after the shootings.
   Rifaat el-Mahgoub, 64, speaker of the People's Assembly and the
second ranking politician after the president, was shot in his
chauffeur-driven Mercedes-Benz as the car passed the Hotel
Semiramis Inter-Continental, said Interior Minister Abdel-Halim
Moussa.
   Moussa told reporters four gunmen, aged 20 to 25, attacked
el-Mahgoub's car and a security car as el-Mahgoub was driving to an
official function at another hotel about 1{ miles away. He said two
men were standing on the road, their rifles hidden in bags. They
opened fire, joined by two others on motorbikes.
   Three men escaped on the bikes. The fourth ran into a densely
populated area nearby and disappeared. Police said a police
brigadier and lieutenant who chanced by on another security mission
tried to chase the running gunman, but he killed the brigadier and
badly wounded the lieutenant.
   The shooting occurred a block from the U.S. Embassy.
   The minister said two security men were killed in el-Mahgoub's
car and another in a security car traveling behind him.
   A Soviet-made hand grenade and four homemade explosives were
found on the roadside near the hotel and defused.
   A military funeral for the five victims was planned for
Saturday. President Hosni Mubarak and other high-ranking officials
are scheduled to attend.
   The assassination came one day after a national referendum to
decide whether Mubarak should dissolve Parliament and call new
elections.
   Moussa warned before the vote that Iraqis and other Arabs had
infiltrated Egypt to undermine the government through terror
attacks, including assassinations. Egypt has led Arab opposition to
Iraq's Aug. 2 occupation of Kuwait.
   The interior minister said Friday he suspected the attackers
were foreigners or local Moslem fundamentalists, but refused to
elaborate.
   The state-owned Al-Ahram newspaper, quoting police sources, said
last Monday that local Moslem extremists were collaborating with
Palestinian terrorists sent to Egypt by Iraq on sabotage missions.
It said the extremists provided weapons and explosives to five
Palestinians of the Abu Nidal group.
   Abu Nidal - real name Sabry el-Banna - leads a radical
Palestinian faction and is known worldwide as a terrorist
mastermind.
   The state-owned Middle East News Agency quoted a security
officer at Cairo airport on Friday as saying all airports were on a
high state of alert to prevent the assailants from leaving Egypt.
Security checkpoints were set up along Cairo bridges and near the
attack site.
   An hour after the shooting, el-Mahgoub's black Mercedes sat
outside the hotel, its rear window and right front window smashed.
One of the two slain bodyguards in the car lay in the front seat,
his head torn apart by gunfire.
   A second car - a green Peugeot - was stopped about 200 yards
away, a man's body hanging onto the roadway from the rear seat. The
man was identified as a security agent traveling with el-Mahgoub.
   Moussa said he was traveling 300 yards behind el-Mahgoub's car.
He dismissed questions about whether he was the intended target.
   Islamic militants tried to kill an interior minister with a bomb
and shot at two interior ministers in 1987. One was wounded
seriously.
   Mubarak's predecessor, Anwar Sadat, was killed on Oct. 6, 1981
by Moslem extremists, who then tried unsuccessfully to overthrow
the government.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We
are shocked by the assassination.''
   The shooting occurred shortly before Moussa was to have briefed
reporters on the outcome of the referendum. Results showed 93
percent of Egyptians voting approved Mubarak's proposal and the
president later issued a decree dissolving the assembly and calling
for elections on Nov. 29.
   Mubarak scheduled the referendum after a constitutional court
declared illegal the election laws under which Parliament was
seated.
   Because Mubarak has not named a vice president, the speaker of
the People's Assembly ranks right behind the president. El-Mahgoub
had been speaker since 1984.
   A member of the governing National Democratic Party, el-Mahgoub
used his authority to pass legislation in accordance with the
government's wishes.

   A leading fund-raiser for Gov. Bob Martinez
was indicted Friday on charges of felony theft and official
misconduct charges, a newspaper reported.
   The Orange County grand jury indictment against B.J. West was
sealed, but her attorney, Bob Leventhal, said it contained felony
charges of grand theft and official misconduct, The Orlando
Sentinel reported in Saturday's editions.
   The charges stem from allegations that West violated state
travel laws and misused her position as a $46,340-a-year employee
for the state Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services.
   Upon conviction, each charge carries a maximum penalty of five
years in prison and a $5,000 fine.
   Martinez named West chairwoman of the Orlando-Orange County
expressway authority in 1987, the same year the health agency hired
her to solicit corporate contributions for its programs. She also
raises money for Martinez' campaign.
   A Martinez spokesman said the governor had no comment.
   West denied the charges, saying ``I will not rest until my name
and my reputation are totally cleared of these unfounded charges.''
   The grand jury based its probe on a state comptroller's
investigation that found West was overpaid about $4,000 for salary,
travel and telephone expenditures, the newspaper reported.
   The investigation, completed in May, found that West improperly
claimed to be working for the health agency on 25 days that she was
traveling for the expressway authority. One trip involved a
transportation convention in Spain for which she claimed both sick
leave and regular work time with HRS.
   The comptroller's investigators did not find that West
campaigned for Martinez on state time.
   West has repaid the money, the newspaper said.
   West blamed opponents of a controversial toll road the
expressway authority wants to build for spreading lies about her
work. She has said she did not understand how to fill out the time
sheets.
   Mac Stipanovich, Martinez' campaign manager, criticized
Orange-Osceola State Attorney Lawson Lamar, a Democrat, for seeking
the indictment. The Republican governor seeks re-election Nov. 6.
   ``I think he's showboating,'' Stipanovich said. ``I can't think
of another instance in which a state employee was indicted for
incorrectly filling out travel forms.''

   The presidents of eight Latin American
countries agreed Friday to create a fund from windfall oil earnings
that would be used to help Latin countries suffering from low
prices for other raw materials.
   The fund was proposed by the leaders of Mexico, Venezuela and
Colombia, all oil producers. Later, the summit of eight presidents
who met here Thursday and Friday ordered consultations on how to
create the fund.
   Host President Carlos Andres Perez said the fund aims at
stabilizing prices for traditional Latin American exports - such as
oil, copper, coffee and sugar.
   ``All of Latin American nations are recurrently affected by
dramatic ups and downs in prices of its exports. One day it is oil,
next it is sugar and copper,'' Perez said at a news conference.
   The idea of the fund would be to soften the fall of countries
whose commodities suffer price swings. But it wasn't immediately
clear how the plan would be carried out.
   The eight presidents later released a communique promising to
intensify their fight against drug trafficking, but warning their
efforts would be useless if rich countries did not curb demand.
   ``A global strategy is needed in the fight against drugs,'' the
presidents said.
   Earlier in the week, Chilean President Patricio Aylwin proposed
that oil-producing countries donate some of their export earnings
when oil prices were especially high.
   On Friday, Perez and presidents Carlos Salinas de Gortari of
Mexico and Cesar Gaviria of Colombia proposed the initiative be
extended to include donations from earnings for other raw products,
such as coffee and sugar.
   In practice, however, oil is one of the few raw materials to
produce windfall income in recent decades. Venezuela is likely to
get at least $2.4 billion in extra revenue thanks to soaring oil
prices since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Perez did not explain how the fund would operate or how much
money would be invested. He said all nations would contribute in
order to receive benefits.
   While oil exporters like Mexico, Ecuador and Venezuela are
theoretically favored by skyrocketing oil prices, experience has
shown that oil boom periods result in severe inflation and economic
destabilization.
   Several weeks ago, Perez announced Venezuela would create a
stabilization fund with its extra oil revenue to avoid inflationary
pressures. Venezuela has been forced to submit its economy to an
austerity plan since the last oil boom bubble bust.
   ``The current oil prices don't do anyone any good, neither
producers nor consumers,'' Ecuadoran President Rodrigo Borja said
Thursday.
   In addition to Borja, Perez, Mexico's Salinas del Gortari,
Gaviria of Colombia and Chile's Aylwin, the presidents attending
the summit were Carlos Menem of Argentina, Fernando Collor de Mello
of Brazil and Luis Alberto Lacalle of Uruguay.
   Peru is also a member of the Rio Group, but President Alberto
Fujimori failed to win congressional authorization to leave his
country and instead sent a delegation headed by his wife.
   The presidents decided Friday to expand the group to include
Bolivia and Paraguay, and to invite one representative each from
Central America and another from the Caribbean.
   Venezuela, Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador and Trinidad and Tobago
together produce over 5.8 million barrels of oil daily.
   The other Latin countries are net oil importers whose economies
have been badly hit by high oil prices.
   Along with the energy crisis, the main subject of the Latin
summit was a proposal by President Bush to create a hemispheric
free-trade zone from Alaska to Patagonia.
   Bush is scheduled to visit Argentina, Paraguay, Brazil and
Venezuela in early December.
   ``He will notice our receptivity to his proposal,'' Perez said.

   Saddam Hussein is starving the last
foreign diplomats from their encircled compounds in Kuwait, a
triumph in his campaign to turn the invaded emirate into the 19th
province of Iraq.
   The Dutch, Italian and Polish embassies, among the compounds
besieged exactly seven weeks ago today, have withdrawn the last of
their diplomats from Kuwait City in the past week. The Belgian and
German governments say they will follow suit shortly.
   The announcements leave the Americans, British, Canadians and
French as the only holdouts among Western missions. Only a few
other nations appear to be staffing their embassies with diplomats.
   The remaining diplomats are surviving mainly on canned food and
occasional loaves of bread carried in by local staff. But they are
surrounded by Iraqi troops enforcing a blockade of supplies. In
most cases, water and electricity have been cut off.

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - California has adopted the nation's
toughest air-quality standards for household products, ordering a
45 percent cut in smog-forming pollutants from such items as hair
spray, window cleaner and floor wax.
   The order Thursday by the Air Resources Board will be phased in
from 1993 to 1998 and could add up to 23 cents to the price of the
16 types of products covered, said Jim Boyd, ARB executive officer.
   Products covered include engine degreaser, windshield washer
fluid, furniture polish, room air freshener, laundry prewash, nail
polish remover, insect repellent, oven cleaner, hair styling gel
and mousse, tile cleaner, and shaving cream.
   When fully in force, the rules would eliminate about 45 tons per
day of hydrocarbon emissions, an amount equal to the emissions of
about 1.4 million vehicles. Currently the household products emit
about 100 tons of hydrocarbons a day.

   Hurricane Lili lashed North Carolina's Outer Banks with

Storm Marco in a squeeze play that unloaded heavy rain on the
South.
   A hurricane watch was posted for the North Carolina coast, where
residents watched seas swell to 8 feet and awaited word on whether
to leave their homes.
   By 10:30 p.m. EDT, Lili was about 620 miles southeast of Cape
Hatteras, N.C., moving west at 23 mph with winds of 75 mph.
Earlier, the hurricane brought rain, thunderstorms and wind gusts

   A rash of arrests of former East German spies has embarrassed
people who ran West Germany's intelligence network and raised
questions about their effectiveness. But the troubles don't stop
there.
   Criminal justice officials fret over the legal complications of
prosecuting former Stasi workers who will undoubtedly say they were

II.

   BEIRUT (AP) - A Shiite Moslem gunman fired at Christian Gen.
Michel Aoun on Friday as he addressed thousands of supporters, but

   The assassination attempt came shortly after the Syrian army
moved thousands of troops toward the enclave for an expected attack
on the headquarters of Aoun, who has resisted orders by Lebanon's

   The developments contributed to the growing instability in the
Middle East, where the United States is struggling to hold together
its alliance of Arab states opposed to the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait.
   Syria, the main power-broker in Lebanon and Iraq's arch-rival,

first real sign of a government crackdown on Russian anti-Semitism.
A lawyer said it was the first time an accused anti-Semite has been

   The judge sentenced Konstantin Smirnov-Ostashvili, a 54-year-old

<DATELINE>SRINAGAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 16th-century Mogul rulers of north
India thought of Kashmir as a paradise and left the dusty,
scorching plains for summer holidays in the lush valley surrounded
by steep Himalayan foothills.
   They started a tradition, and eventually 750,000 people visited
Kashmir each April-October season.
   This year, not even 20,000 have come. A Moslem insurgency and a
harsh government crackdown have made the valley more a battlefield
than a tourist destination.
   Soldiers are billeted in Srinagar's luxury hotels and patrol the
boulevard along Dal Lake. Gunfire echoes in the still nights.
   ``We have been devastated,'' said Mohammed Yusuf Chapri, whose
family has been in the tourism business since 1870. ``Tourism has
dropped 99.5 percent.''
   Chapri, a burly man in his 50s, owns two houseboats, the
floating hotels that made Dal Lake famous. At least 1,150 are
anchored on the lake, ranging from economy one-roomers to luxurious
six-bedroom units richly paneled in walnut.
   ``Even in World War II, tourists flocked to Kashmir,'' Chapri
said. ``From what I've heard, this is the worst year for tourism in
Kashmir in the past 120 years.''
   The government agrees, but says it can do little.
   ``We have to live with the fall in tourism until conditions
return to normal,'' said Ved Marwah, an adviser to Gov. Girish
Saxena appointed by the federal government.
   ``People dependent on tourism have suffered,'' he said. ``What
we have done is to ensure that their loans are not called and no
penalty interest is levied for inability to pay back.''
   Others suffering include tour operators, hoteliers and owners of
shikaras, the gondola-like boats that carried vacationers on
sightseeing trips and floating picnics. Chapri estimated the total
number of people dependent on the industry at about 500,000.
   Kashmir's economic disaster extends far beyond tourism.
   The valley's largest industry is agriculture, which accounts for
80 percent of its income. Rice grown in Kashmir is consumed in the
region, but apples are sold to other parts of India.
   This year, the deep red and golden apples of Kashmir have been
picked and stored, but few buyers have come.
   ``There are just no traders,'' said an orchard owner who could
not find buyers for his $16,000 harvest. ``This fighting has scared
them away.''
   Truck owners, whose vehicles carried Kashmir apples to the main
wholesale market in New Delhi, also fear entering the valley.
   Marwah, the governor's adviser, said state authorities had
started an apple-marketing program but would buy only 100,000 tons
of a crop that totaled 1.7 million tons.
   One economic benefit of the insurgency was greater output of
handicrafts and hand-woven carpets and handicrafts, he said. As
Marwah explained: ``There's so much trouble, people stay more at
home, and if they're home, they tend to work more.''
   A government fund of $9 milion has been set up to buy
handicrafts and sell them elsewhere in the country.
   Tourist shops in neighboring Nepal are filled with Kashmiri
shawls, jewelry and papier-mache boxes, which they sell to Indian,
Japanese and Western tourists who used to visit Srinagar.
   ``The economy is under stress, but the government has done a
lot,'' Marwah said. ``Tourism is a vital input, but its failure
doesn't bring the economy to a grinding halt.''
   In Srinigar, it is easy to see the effects of the insurgency and
the limited government efforts to take up the economic slack.
   Hundreds of people sit aimlessly along Dal Lake and in the old
city during daylight hours, when the curfew is relaxed.
   Many housewives use apples in curry because they are cheaper and
more plentiful than meat and vegetables.
   ``We have been used to the best of times,'' said Chapri, the
houseboat owner, ``and now we're seeing the worst.''

<HEAD>Jackie Robinson Court-Martial Movie Guilty of Poor Script</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   During World War II, at what now is Fort Hood,
Texas, a black lieutenant in the then-segregated Army refused the
contemptuous order of a white civilian driver to sit in the rear of
a post bus.
   Military police were called. The young officer - who in 1947
would become famed as the first black to play major league baseball
- was further insulted by the MPs. He sharply protested and was
brought up on charges.
   ``The Court-Martial of Jackie Robinson,'' premiering tonight on
Ted Turner's TNT cable network, dramatizes that shameful,
relatively little-known period in the history of the Army and the
United States. TNT deserves credit for the effort.
   Unfortunately, the road to disappointment is paved with good
intentions, and ``Court-Martial'' is a two-hour example of that.
   On the bright side, Andre Braugher is first-rate as the proud,
fiery Robinson. So is Dale Dye in a small supporting role as a
tough, white lieutenant colonel who respects Robinson both as a man
and a soldier.
   The bad news is the script, which took four people to write. It
has no real focus, as so often is the case with four-handed
scrivening.
   The movie could have been taut and engrossing had it just zeroed
in on events leading up to the court-martial and the trial itself.
   Instead, it often flounders about as it tries to re-create the
times in which Robinson lived, telling, among other things, of his
love for the coed (Kasi Lemmons) he married and of his warm,
strong-willed mother (Ruby Dee).
   No real insights emerge, just that the women helped keep him
going when he wanted to quit UCLA, where he was a sports star, and
after Pearl Harbor, when he was drafted into the Army and faced
bigotry the second he got off the bus for basic training.
   The script also has two baseball scouts (Bruce Dern and Paul
Dooley) who periodically pop in and out of the story. One is a
racist, and both work for Brooklyn Dodgers' President Branch
Rickey, who later hired Robinson.
   No doubt their presence is intended to get the baseball angle
in. Bad move. It only clutters things up.
   The movie does occasionally show signs of life, particularly in
its depictions of the nastiness of racial segregation in the Army
and the hurt of being called ``coon'' and ``boy'' while facing the
same war overseas as whites.
   As the film shows, Robinson refuses to give in. Seeking more
seating for blacks in the cafeteria at Fort Hood's segregated post
exchange, he crisply tells one racist major:
   ``The Negro troops are prepared to fight and die, just like
white troops. If they're going to die like whites, they might as
well eat like them.''
   There are good scenes, too, showing the friendship between the
impatient, rightly frustrated Robinson and the wise, knowing boxing
great he meets in the Army - Sgt. Joe Louis (quietly and
effectively played by Stan Shaw).
   The younger man, asking Louis how he endures the racist slurs
he's gotten in the boxing ring, comes to adopt the boxer's reply as
his personal motto: ``I hit 'em first, faster and harder.''
   Another plus: The film's realistic depictions of military
matters. That's largely due to Dye, a retired Marine captain who,
as he did in ``Platoon,'' doubles here as an actor and a technical
adviser.
   It's too bad that Braugher's performance, Dye's work and
generally good efforts by the other players go for naught.
   But there's little any actor can do with a script that is so
uneven that its key moment, the court-martial, has no high drama at
all. It comes off flatter than a first sergeant's feet.
   At least TNT is trying to do something other than the major
networks' usual disease-of-the-week or trash-of-the-week movies.
   But if TNT executives keep getting scripts as wobbly as ``The
Court-Martial of Jackie Robinson,'' they should be made to stay
after telecast and write 100 times, ``The play's the thing.''

   IT'S BEEN SWELL, MOLLY DODD: ``The Days and Nights of Molly
Dodd'' are coming to a close, but not until next spring. The
Lifetime cable network, which picked up the series from NBC last
year, has ended production of the saga of a New York City divorcee
played by Blair Brown. The final 13 episodes of the series -
Lifetime made 26 others - will start airing in January. The first,
Lifetime says, will reveal the father of Molly's unborn baby.

<HEAD>Bad Reaction for Chemical Stocks</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For a classic demonstration of how a bear market
works, the stocks of companies in the chemical industry seem to
possess all the necessary elements.
   Their prices have been battered across the board in recent
months as the stock market as a whole has fallen to its lowest
levels in a year and a half.
   The selling has been relentless, even for stocks of companies
that appeared to be well-positioned in specialized markets presumed
to be resistant to recessions and the effects of soaring oil
prices.
   ``We realize that a bear market is tough on everyone,'' says
Paul Leming, chemical industry analyst at Wall Street's Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co. ``The level of pain and suffering in the chemical
industry has gone beyond the bounds of good taste, however.''
   Through August and September, Leming said, the chemical stocks
he follows tumbled an average of 25 percent, while the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-stock composite index dropped 14 percent.
   ``The market seems to be making no distinction between the
fundamentals of different companies,'' he said. ``The stocks are
just being taken out and shot.''
   There are a couple of broad reasons why the chemical stocks'
reaction to recent events has been so pronounced, observers say.
   First of all, the business has a firmly entrenched image as a
smokestack industry whose fortunes have long been sensitive to the
ups and downs of the economic cycle. Whisper ``recession'' and the
chemical stocks feel a breeze.
   Secondly, the industry is a heavy user of petroleum-based raw
materials, putting it squarely in the path of the oil-price
increases that have followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   ``The sharp escalation in oil prices is having a major impact on
the fundamentals of the basic chemical industry,'' says George
Krug, who follows the stocks for Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   A good many analysts argue, however, that the same conclusion
isn't warranted, or at least not to the same degree, for companies
in specialty chemicals - for example, coatings, adhesives, dyes and
cleaning materials, which oftentimes are made with the commodity
chemicals produced by the basic manufacturers.
   ``In many respects, specialty chemical companies are a world
apart from their basic chemical counterparts,'' Stephen Grant, an
analyst at Value Line Investment Survey, says in the advisory
firm's latest quarterly report on the industry.
   Basic chemical manufacturers most likely will have to absorb the
brunt of the increase in petrochemical costs, passing only part of
the increase through to the specialty companies, Grant argues.
   Therefore, he says, ``raw materials costs for specialty chemical
producers probably will continue to advance only modestly.
   ``And for these technology-based companies with proprietary
products, the higher costs should be easy to pass on to
customers.''
   Nevertheless, Grant acknowledges, specialty chemical makers do
suffer from exposure to weakness in the markets they supply.
``Primary end markets include autos, construction and electronics,
each of which is in a slump.''
   As for the chemical industry as a whole, most analysts believe a
full-fledged revival may have to await signs pointing to the next
upward turn in the economic cycle.
   Said Leming at Morgan Stanley: ``Today's problems - the
predominant one being overcapacity - are likely to sow the seeds
for tomorrow's boom. As profitability deteriorates, there should be
a slowdown in capacity additions.
   ``We don't believe it's appropriate to give up on the chemicals
forever, because we think this group will once again have its day
in the sun. Unfortunately, that day could be as far away as 1995.''

<HEAD>Bonn Tries To Keep Government From Moving to Berlin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government and Parliament flew to
glamorous Berlin en masse to celebrate German unity in the
traditional capital, but this dull little city on the Rhine is
determined they won't escape for good.
   During its 41 years as West Germany's capital, Bonn has become
``a symbol of the first successful German democracy,'' Mayor Hans
Daniels said proudly.
   Wolfgang Schnitzler, a 60-year-old taxi driver who may lose his
job if Bonn loses the politicians, said: ``To my way of thinking,
moving the government to Berlin would be a criminal act.''
   Berlin became the symbolic capital on unity day, Oct. 3, but
Bonn still is the seat of government. Whether the government moves
is up to Parliament.
   The Bonn-Berlin competition has taken some nasty turns.
   Bonn boosters say Berlin should not be the seat of united
Germany because it was the center of Nazi power in 1933-1945.
   In a newspaper interview published on unity eve, Daniels said
Bonn, ``which has no triumphal arches, has never displayed itself
with arrogance.'' His not-so-oblique reference was to Berlin's
Brandenburg Gate and the Nazi parades that once passed through it.
   Backers of Berlin say Bonn is too small and unexciting to be the
new Germany's political heart.
   ``Berlin is supremely suited in view of its location, its
history and its role as a cultural crossroads,'' said Walter
Momper, mayor of Berlin.
   In the eyes of the world, Berlin is in the same class as London,
Rome, Paris, and Madrid, he said.
   That kind of talk irritates Daniels.
   Keeping the government and Parliament in Bonn would make it
impossible for Berlin to gain the power it once held over Germany,
he said, and ``the Germans would be declaring a national modesty.''
   Modest is an apt word for Bonn.
   The government is housed in buildings whose architectural styles
range from drab to dismal. Parliament meets in the former
waterworks, a vast, ugly structure on the riverbank.
   Visitors spend little time in Bonn. Its best-known sights, such
as Beethoven's birthplace, the charming market square and the 18th
century city hall, can be covered easily in less than a day.
   Lawmakers from now-defunct East Germany showed some curiosity
when they attended the all-German Parliament's first working
session, but left town quickly when it was over. Some complained of
trouble in finding a place to eat late at night.
   Farm tractors pulling loads of manure frequently cause traffic
jams.
   By contrast, Berlin is home to a seemingly infinite array of
cultural and historical offerings, including the Reichstag, the
remains of the Wall, numerous museums and some of the best music
and theater in Europe.
   Government does not depend on such things, Daniels said. He
described Bonn, on the rim of Western Europe, as a perfect bridge
between the new Germany and the West.
   Daniels pointed out that moving the government would be
enormously expensive. Some experts say the transfer could cost up
to $65 billion at a time when hundreds of billions are needed to
absorb and rebuild East Germany.
   The mayor acknowledges his city would become a virtual ghost
town if the government left, since most of Bonn's 300,000 people
are somehow linked to it.
   Bonn also is in the middle of a costly construction program that
includes a new Parliament, and the mayor said much money would be
lost if it were stopped.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl has indicted he is in no hurry to move
the government.
   ``This is certainly not a question which is of any urgency to
me, as far as the agenda is concerned,'' he said Sept. 30.
   Whether the new Parliament will agree is another question.

<HEAD>Panama Digging Out After Dictatorship and Invasion</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhotos</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economy is growing and
unemployment is shrinking. Exiles have returned and so have
millions of badly needed dollars sent abroad for safekeeping.
   Problems still abound 10 months after the U.S. invasion that
deposed and captured Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, but Panama is
gradually crawling out from under years of corrupt military
leadership and U.S. economic sanctions.
   It is a slow process. Squabbling within the coalition government
may be scaring off foreign investors and suspicion lingers that
Panama is a country without a plan.
   Unemployment and underemployment are estimated at about 25
percent. That is down from 35 percent at the beginning of 1990, but
30,000 more Panamanians join the labor force each year.
   Noriega collaborators are in the new civilian police force, but
are being systematically retired and more than half Noriega's
officers are out, including the highest ranks. Graduates of
military academies are not welcome in the new police, who replace
Noriega's Panama Defense Force.
   Although 2,000 people remain homeless because much of the El
Chorillo slum was destroyed in the invasion, thousands more are in
new or renovated housing and the rest are to be housed by year's
end.
   Officially, the invasion cost the lives of 314 Panamanians, 202
of them civilians. Many critics put the toll at several times that
and accuse the Panamanian and American governments of covering up,
but little evidence has been produced.
   The economy, which shrank about 16 percent in 1987-89, is
expected to grow by 7 percent this year. Panama is resuming payment
to foreign creditors on a debt that is among the world's highest
per capita.
   No physical signs of the invasion remain, but it is far from
forgotten.
   ``I think most Panamanians feel the invasion was a liberation,
but it definitely left an open wound in the national psyche,'' said
Roberto Eisenmann, publisher of the independent newspaper La
Prensa.
   ``This is becoming even more evident as time goes on. The only
medicine is to come out of it a demilitarized country. If Panama
remilitarizes, history will not forgive us.''
   Noriega closed Eisenmann's paper and the publisher spent years
in exile.
   ``They are amateurs,'' he said patiently of the new
administrtion. ``They were condemned to the opposition for 21
years. They are learning the process.''
   Some new Cabinet ministers literally had to look in the
telephone book to find their new offices, he said.
   President Guillermo Endara has been criticized as weak after two
decades of military rule.
   ``I think if you scratch the surface, you will find out many
people want a weak president right now,'' Eisenmann said. ``Endara
is probably the right man for the job at this time in our
history.''
   ``The dictatorship was a parenthesis in our history, a long one
but a parenthesis,'' he said. ``Panama now needs to fall back on
its traditions'' of democracy ``and make it work.''
   Panama has no organized political opposition at the moment. The
military's Revolutionary Democratic Party, in power since 1968,
seems to have dropped from sight, but still has six members in the
57-seat National Assembly.
   Endara's opposition comes from within the governing alliance.
Analysts generally agree elements of the coalition, especially the
Christian Democrats, will break off and bid for power as the 1994
elections approach.
   The president has said he will preserve the alliance as long as
possible, and his government appears to be in no immediate danger.
   ``More binds the parties together than separates them,'' U.S.
Ambassador Deane Hinton said in an interview. ``They are condemned
to work together.''
   Outside the government, the parties are involved in a political
feud that sometimes resembles a brawl:
   - Mayor Guillermo Cochez, whose Christian Democrats hold the
most National Assembly seats, suggested in a newspaper column that
the Endara government ``has few differences from one'' in the
Noriega period. Endara, who represents the smaller Authentic
Liberal Party, suggested Cochez resign.
   - The three smallest coalition parties teamed up with Noriega's
old party to bump the Christian Democrats from the assembly
presidency. First Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon called the
three parties Noriega sympathizers.
   - Endara vetoed more than half the first 20 major bills to reach
his desk. - Second Vice President Guillermo Ford claimed the new
police force, controlled by Arias Calderon, was ineffective against
crime. The two are expected to be opponents for the presidency.
   Dissent within the government is strange to Panamanians after 21
years of military rule that began with a coup in 1968 by Gen. Omar
Torrijos.
   Endara and his vice presidents ``are not the paternal leaders
Panamanians have gotten used to,'' said Mayin Correa, a former
opposition legislator who has been host of a political talk show
since returning from exile in Miami.
   Radio stations broadcast a National Assembly debate on revoking
the immunity of three members from the military party accused of
committing crimes while Noriega was in power. One called her
accuser a child molester. He said she was a drunk.
   Ms. Correa says she welcomed the system's openness, but wouldn't
want to be in the assembly now.
   Sovereignty issues have affected otherwise good relations with
the United States.
   At the behest of Foreign Minister Julio Linares, Endara has
suggested the United States owes reparations for damage wrought by
the invasion. No amount has been mentioned.
   ``It's a nice issue to beat (Washington) over the head with, but
it isn't going anywhere,'' Ambassador Hinton said, and suggested
the demand was primarily for internal political consumption.
   Losses from looting and other causes not stemming from the
fighting have been estimated at up to $1.5 billion, which is
generally considered high. Little was paid by insurance companies,
which cited act-of-war clauses.
   The nited States has allocated $430 million for Panamanian
recovery, with about $130 million dependent on an agreement to
exchange banking information in criminal cases.
   Linares, the foreign minister, has said he will not approve an
accord that weakens Panama's confidential banking system, although
it was used in drug deals under Noriega.
   Hinton said: ``Only if you believe it is in Panama's interests
to shield illegal acts, is this agreement a threat to Panama.''
   The banking system has been a major factor in attracting
business. More than 100 banks, most of them foreign, have offices
in Panama.
   Dario Selles, president of the Panama Industrial Association,
said in an interview there is worry in the private sector that
money will go elsewhere if the system is changed.
   New investment is critical to Panama, Selles said.
   About 80 percent of the economy involves services: banking, the
Panama Canal, construction and government work. Agriculture and
industry account for the rest.
   ``Unemployment is Panama's single worst problem and the labor
pool is growing at about 30,000 a year,'' Selles said. ``The
service sector is still big, but it is saturated. It is important,
but it is not generating new jobs.''
   ``We are asking the government to develop some kind of plan,''
he said. ``In the past, there was no goal, no strategy. The
dictatorship didn't have to promise anything.''

   The El Chorrillo slum of reeking
tenements, rats, crime and disease was no garden spot, but to
thousands of families it was home.
   It also was home to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's headquarters,
and when U.S. forces invaded in December, much of El Chorrillo was
burned or blown to splinters. Nearly 3,000 families - about 16,000
people - lost their homes.
   The Panamanian and American governments have been working to
relocate them. Centers for the homeless are emptying into renovated
apartments and new subdivisions, but not everyone is happy with the
results.
   On a sweltering afternoon, a dozen residents of the 24th of
December Project, a cooperative apartment building heavily damaged
in the battle, lounged on the front steps sipping beer and local
rum.
   ``At least the elevator goes to the top now,'' one resident said
about the 15-story building, which was reoccupied in July.
``Before, it only went partway and there was no water on the top
floors.''
   Another countered: ``I had tile on my floor and the looters took
it, and my door won't close all the way. The sink leaks.''
   Complaints outnumber compliments.
   ``The United States made us leave,'' said Rafael Olivardia, a
member of the building committee. ``We left our apartments locked,
then when we came back, there wasn't even a bed. The tile was
ripped up, the copper plumbing was pulled out of the wall, all the
furniture was gone.''
   Aleyeda Teran told of a foot of water accumulating in a
top-floor apartment during a rainstorm because of poorly plugged
bullet holes and leaky walls.
   ``It dripped down through apartments on all 15 floors,'' she
said. ``These things didn't happen before the invasion.''
   Olivardia declared: ``The construction companies did bad work,
but we blame the United States and Panama because they paid for the
poor work. We have written letters to everyone, but nobody
responds.''
   The United States budgeted $2.5 million for the cooperative,
which houses about 450 families, but used only $1.6 million and
spent the rest on other buildings.
   Through the U.S. Agency for International Development,
Washington is financing several options for displaced people as
part of its Panama recovery plan.
   Those who return to renovated apartments in El Chorrillo are
given $800 a family to replace personal belongings. Most say it is
not enough.
   Others can get $6,500 to apply toward small houses in
subdivisions built by private contractors, or to buy land and
build. People with jobs may qualify for loans of an additional
$6,500.
   Families choosing subdivisions get ownership of a lot, with
water, electricity and septic tank service, and a concrete-block
house with a metal roof.
   Many say the one-room house $6,500 buys is inadequte for a
family. In most developments, houses offered at that price are
about 15 feet square with a small division for the kitchen and
bathroom.
   People who qualify for supplemental loans can buy larger houses.
   About 850 families have moved into the subdivisions and 270 more
houses are ready for occupancy.
   ``Over the next few months we hope to complete about 250 houses
a month,'' said Kevin Kelley of the USAID mission.
   ``There have been some complaints, we understand,'' he said of
the 24th of December project. ``We have looked into them and most
of them were lodged when the people first moved back.
   ``The contractors were bonded and (the buyers) have guarantees.
We don't agree that construction was shoddy. It was well supervised
by the Panamanian Housing Ministry and the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers. We think it was good.''
   More than 700 families still live in centers, including hangars
at a military base. Others are with family or friends.
   U.S. and Panamanian officials say they hope to have the hangar
residents relocated by year's end, although many living there have
been declared ineligible for relocation aid because they did not
live in El Chorrillo.
   Much of El Chorrillo was built at the turn of the century as a
barracks complex for Panama Canal construction workers. A U.S.
Embassy official said many residents of the decrepit buildings were
squatters.
   Many former residents will not be able to return to the old
neighborhood because most of the land is privately held and the
owners hope to use it more profitably.

   TAP has become a model for anti-poverty efforts across the
nation. Three of its programs have been lifted whole to other
states. Another, which brought safe drinking water and toilets
first to rural homes in the Roanoke Valley, then all of Virginia,
eventually moved to Washington as a national program.
   CHIP became TAP's 30th agency. It fit right in.
   To get it going, Brand brought together doctors, public health
professionals, lawyers, TAP veterans, state and local officials,
``everyone we thought could help,'' he said.
   ``We identified the problem and worked out a plausible solution.
The state health department gave us $118,000 and we were on our
way.''
   They started the program June 16, 1988 with Pierce, the five
pediatricians in practice with him, and 100 patients. It went well.
After a year they grew to 300 patients and more doctors. That went
even better. Six months later the state upped its ante to $200,000
and the W.K. Kellogg Foudation of Michigan granted $1.5 million to
expand further. Last August Kellogg, impressed, came up with
another $2.3 million to spread CHIP across Virginia.
   Now CHIP has more than 900 patients enrolled. All six of the
valley's children's dentists participate, and all but three of its
19 family doctors and 14 pediatricians. (CHIP turned down the three
because they didn't cover on nights and weekends).
   ``We have a ways to go,'' said Peggy Balla, the CHIP director.
``We have identified 4,800 potential patients and hope to get them
all. We get more efficient every day. We've worked out a lot of
bugs. Our computer programs and all our experience will be helpful
in the replication of CHIP in other areas.''
   One of the bugs was getting prescriptions filled. The public
health office, which fills them cut-rate, closes at 5 p.m. The
valley's largest drugstore chain now provides 24-hour service at
even lower prices. Another bug: doctor appointments missed for lack
of transportation. A church donated a van.
   ``That's what community action is all about,'' said Cabell Brand
``It's the key to the whole program.''
   The CHIP staff includes six public health nurses and six
outreach workers. They work as teams, visiting each patient
regularly at home - case management, an essential of the whole
scheme. Each team has a case load of about 150, which they agree is
too many but will improve with more staff.
   The nurse has a copy of the same records the doctor keeps. She
sees that his orders are followed, medication given, appointments
kept, the main complaints doctors had about the habits of Medicaid
patients.
   ``Just convincing the parents that they really do have a doctor
they can call any time they have a question, and persuading them to
do it, even in the middle of the night, may be the hardest job of
all,'' said one nurse, Connie Willet.
   ``But watching the way they light up when they finally come to
realize they are included in the health care system, which most of
us take for granted, is really satisfying. Sometimes I think their
new-found self-esteem is the best medicine of all.''
   Willet's outreach worker teammate, Darlene Brown, was able to
come up with a second bed when Roberta McCraw had twins, has helped
her find diapers in an emergency, as well as food and clothes. The
five little McCraws also are regular patrons of CHIP's free Lending
Library. Not books, toys.
   Case workers tend to get personally interested in CHIP families.
One McCraw child now has a good winter coat that Darlene Brown's
own daughter outgrew. Another has a coat formerly worn by a child
of teammate Connie Willet.
   CHIP's doctors get paid at the Medicaid rate. If the patient
doesn't quite qualify for Medicaid the same rate applies.
Qualification in Virginia is the same as the federal minimum of 135
percent of the poverty level but CHIP stretches that to 150 percent
to take in the working poor. Doctors say it covers about 70 percent
of their regular fees.
   But CHIP does the billing, relieves the doctors of Medicaid
paperwork and further makes life easier by sending along with each
new CHIP patient a medical-history questionnaire already completed
by the case nurse. Not to mention seeing to it that his
instructions are followed and appointments kept.
   In the doctor's waiting room - or in the treatment room -
there's no way to tell a CHIP patient from any other. When it's
time to pay, the parent shows a CHIP card and that's that.
   Preventive medicine - shots, checkups, what the doctors call
well care - are, like fire prevention, obviously beneficial but
hard to measure in dollars. How much in future medical bills will
CHIP save by giving children a healthy start? The Children's
Defense Fund, a national group, says the annual saving is $10 for
every $1 spent. Health insurance companies, with one eye on that
huge group of uninsured, are keeping the other eye on CHIP.
   ``We have a chance to do some blow-away things here, it seems to
me,'' said John Berry, head of Blue Cross-Blue Shield in Virginia.
   Blue Cross has supported CHIP from the beginning, completely
outfitting the CHIP office in Roanoke with furniture and equipment.
   One major financial effect of CHIP is apparent right now from a
recent survey of 10,000 children's visits to the Roanoke Memorial
Hospital emergency room.
   It found that nearly half, 46 percent, were between 3 p.m. and
midnight, and that fewer than 15 percent were ``justifiable
emergency room visits,'' according to Dr. Preston Boggess, director
of pediatric education.
   ``In an emergency room, with no records of the patient
available, you have to practice defensive medicine,'' Boggess said.
``That means extensive tests and lab work to cover all the
possibilities.
   ``They are mostly unnecessary, always costly and take time from
real emergencies. But some people have no place else to take a sick
child.''
   Roberta McCraw has.
   ``The baby was fussing and running a fever and I was scared to
death,'' she said.
   ``I had never called my doctor at night and didn't know whether
I should maybe just go ahead to the emergency room.
   ``But I called, and he said to bring her in.
   ``It wasn't my doctor but was one in the same building. It was
his turn to work that night.
   ``He examined her and looked at her records and in a minute
said, `Mrs. McCraw, Amanda's teething. Take her home, she'll be
just fine.'
   ``And she was.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Henry F. Cooper says he still believes in
former President Reagan's dream of erecting an impenetrable shield
in space against a massive missile attack.
   But as the new director of Star Wars, Cooper is quietly charting
a more down-to-earth course for the multibillion-dollar project
Reagan started in 1983.
   From his headquarters in the Pentagon basement, Cooper is
piecing together a plan that shifts the Star Wars focus away from
efforts to protect against an all-out Soviet attack with thousands
of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.
   The new aim is more modest: to build a defense against a few
dozen or few hundred missiles launched accidentally by Moscow or
deliberately by a Third World despot.
   More than the numbers have changed for Star Wars, officially
known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, or SDI. So, too, has the
idea at the heart of Reagan's proposal: that a missile defense can
be found that would make nuclear arms obsolete.
   In fact, quite a different view is behind Cooper's approach. He
thinks that while the Soviet missile arsenal is still formidable
and capable of destroying the United States, a greater danger is
that more Third World nations are likely to acquire nuclear
arsenals.
   In taking this new tack, Cooper is acknowledging that Congress
has all but killed Star Wars in its original form. To keep the
concept of anti-missile defense alive, Cooper is banking on public
support for a more limited, less costly system.
   ``If we can get people to agree that at least limited protection
is something that we ought to be doing . . . then we can go ahead
with the research and development. It would be a great step
forward,'' Cooper said in a recent interview.
   Cooper has even found a friendly acronym for his plan: PALS, or
Protection Against Limited Strikes. He says it could be put into
operation as early as 1996 and would cost less than the $55 billion
price tag of the previous Star Wars plan.
   PALS is not yet official Bush administration policy, but Cooper
said he is making decisions on the assumption that it soon will be.
``They hired me to make decisions, not to wait until the final `i'
is dotted and the final `t' is crossed,'' he said.
   He is the first civilian director of SDI, but Cooper is no
stranger to strategic defense. He was chief U.S. negotiator on
defense and space matters from 1987 to 1989, a task that included
trying to persuade the Soviets to drop their objections to SDI and
to agree on a mutual transition from offensive arms to defensive
weapons.
   In that job, Cooper says he became acquainted with many key
members of Congress - relationships he hopes will help him turn the
tide of congressional opinion on SDI.
   Over the past two years, the SDI program, while moving ahead
with anti-missile technologies on the drawing board, has been
losing ground in the political arena. Moscow still opposes the
project and Congress has begun cutting the SDI budget, which may
fall this year to $3 billion or less from $3.7 billion last year.
   Cooper said the previous Star Wars goal of defending against an
attack by thousands of enemy missiles no longer fits the evolving
picture of a reforming Soviet Union.
   ``We were thinking entirely of a world of competition with the
Soviet Union,'' he said. ``We're now beginning to think in terms of
a world of cooperation.''
   Many in Congress believe the changing world order means SDI is
less important. Even Cooper says that before he assumed the
director's job last July, he harbored some doubt about the Bush
administration's commitment to the project.
   ``I wrestled with the issue of whether or not to come because it
is obviously a critical period - I refer to it as a make-or-break
time,'' Cooper said, adding that before accepting the post he
talked with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney about Bush's views.
   ``The secretary believes the president is committed to this
program,'' he said.
   Cooper said that he sought no assurances directly from Bush
before taking the job and that he has not been disappointed at the
absence of heavy presidential lobbying for SDI.
   ``It hasn't bothered me that he's not talking out, not
trumpeting SDI all the time,'' Cooper said.
   Still, Cooper has taken it upon himself to find a way of
building or Star Wars and keeping it from withering
on the scientific vine.
   ``I didn't come to package it up and put it on the shelf,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Milken to Extra Innings, and the Rich Get Poorer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES M. KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Is there a smoking gun in the Michael Milken
affair?
   Government prosecutors would like nothing more than to produce
one in a special presentencing hearing for the junk-bond financier
that began this past week.
   But in the first day of the two-week show in Manhattan federal
court, no big bombshells dropped. Two government witnesses failed
to directly link Milken to the systematic stock manipulation
alleged by the government.
   The first round of testimony still managed to produce some news.
A trader for Milken's former employer, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
revealed he had a secret, middle-of-the-night meeting with Milken
after stock speculator Ivan Boesky turned state's evidence in 1986.
   Boesky, once one of Milken's regular customers, would become his
chief accuser.
   The ex-trader, Cary Maultasch, described a cloak-and-dagger
rendezvous with Milken at Drexel's office in Beverly Hills, Calif.
The pair spoke in hushed tones with a guard posted at the door.
Milken scribbled his most sensitive comments about Boesky on a pad
and erased them immediately, but Maultasch couldn't recall exactly
what was communicated.
   The ``mini-trial'' resumes Monday before Judge Kimba Wood, who
is trying to focus her image of Milken before pronouncing his
sentence. She ordered the hearing after the government and the
defense provided her with documents painting widely divergent
portraits of the ex-billionaire.
   The hearing covers a handful of allegations beyond the crimes
Milken admitted in his six-count guilty plea in April. Wood is
nevertheless limited to the maximum penalty of 28 yars in prison
prescribed in the plea bargain.
   The prosecution's case hangs on three transactions, in which it
claims Milken abused securities laws. The defense, led by attorney
Arthur Liman, will try to deflect those blows while promoting its
alternative image of Milken as a misunderstood genius of finance
and warm-hearted do-gooder.
   The hearing, although it takes the Milken chase into extra
innings, has left some observers less than excited because of its
limited scope.
   ``We will never have confidence in knowing what happened,'' said
Albert Alschuler, criminal law expert at the University of Chicago
Law School.

<TEXT>
   As Milken ran the gantlet of photographers and reporters on his
way to court, he could at least take solace in the fact that he
remains one of the nation's wealthiest people.
   The latest ranking of Forbes magazine's 400 richest Americans
put the Californian at 115th, worth $700 million. That's a demotion
from his days as a billionaire, thanks to the $600 million
settlement included in his plea bargain.
   In general, the rich got poorer in the past year, according to
the magazine. Fifty-three of the Forbes 400 suffered net-worth
declines, ranging from $100 million to nearly $900 million.
   In contrast to Milken, most suffered at the hands of the
economy.
   For the first time in the eight years Forbes has been publishing
the register, the minimum fortune it took to make the grade
dropped, from $275 million in 1989 to $260 million.
   John Werner Kluge, the Metromedia tycoon, topped the list with
an estimated $5.6 billion.

<HEAD>TRUMP: Among the Richest No More</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   One name missing from the Forbes ranking was Donald Trump, whose
1989 fortune of $1.7 billion has almost completely disappeared.
   Trump's troubles continued during the week with word that his
second book, ``Surviving at the Top,'' hadn't survived long on The
New York Times best-seller list. The paper said the book had fallen
off the list after only seven weeks. His first book, ``The Art of
the Deal,'' lingered 48 weeks on the list after it was introduced
in 1987.
   Trump was also reported to be negotiating new terms for loans on
two of his casinos in his continuing efforts to keep his gambling,
real estate and airline empire aloft.
   Takeover investor Carl Icahn (65th on the Forbes list at $1
billion) also emerged in the Trump storyline as a possible investor
in Trump's casino bonds. Reports said Icahn was snapping up the
sagging notes as a long-term investment.

<HEAD>MARKETS: The Market's Balloon Loses More Air</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bottom-fishing could become the sport of choice on Wall Street
as the stock market swoons.
   Over three successive days the market lost more than 6 percent,
as measured by the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 stocks,
prompting The Wall Street Journal to proclaim the ``official''
arrival of the bear market.
   The Journal said that by falling below 2,400 on Thursday and
more than 20 percent over the past two months, the Dow had
fulfilled the classic requirements of a down market.
   Corporate earnings reinforced the market's pessimism. CBS Inc.
reported a 30 percent drop in third-quarter profits; Chemical
Banking posted a $43.7 million loss and slashed its dividend.
   Oil continued its relentless move upward, setting records above
the $40 per barrel mark on the futures exchange. Silver, meanwhile,
plummeted toward $4 per troy ounce.
   The silver slide heightened recession fears because it indicated
sinking industrial demand for the metal.

   The nation's retailers were slip-sliding toward Christmas with
bad tidings for thefall season.
   Their sales reports for September were grim; some even showed a
decline from year-ago levels. Worries about the economy and the
Persian Gulf crisis were mostly to blame, but the weather also
contributed. Warmer than normal temperatures dissauded some
consumers from shopping for winter clothing.
   The government reported that wholesale prices shot up 1.6
percent in September, led by an unprecedented 20.6 percent leap in
gasoline.

   General Motors Corp. introduced its new fuel-efficient,

future sales would come at the expense of GM's competitors,
including the Japanese.
   But analysts were concerned about the other third, which would
come out of GM's own hide. The cars go on sale Oct. 25, at base
prices ranging from $7,995 to $11,775.

<HEAD>October Woes For Wall Street</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   October has been putting in an earnest bid so
far to live up to its reputation as a villainous month for Wall
Street.
   In a three-day span this past week, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials took a drop of 158 points, or 6.29 pecent, to a new
18-month low. That was more than enough to evoke vivid memories of
October massacres past in the stock market.
   Just a year ago, there was the Friday the 13th ``mini-crash,''
when the Dow fell 190 points in a single session.
   Two years before that was the Crash of 1987, which culminated in
a 508-point collapse on Monday, Oct. 19.
   Further back in investment annals were the back-to-back declines
of October 1978 (a loss of 9.2 percent) and 1979 (6.9 percent).
   And of course the 1929 crash, which helped to usher in almost a
decade of economic misery, was another October production.
   With such past performances to go on, it seems no surprise at
all that investors would be in a jumpy mood. The economic and
political news, meanwhile, has fallen into step to help ensure that
no stray element of cheer creeps into the picture.
   The stalemate with Iraq in the Persian Gulf has kept relentless
upward pressure on world oil prices. The battle of the budget in
Washington produces nothing but frustration.
   Corporate profits and dividends tumble, but interest rates cling
stubbornly to their lofty perch.
   Against this background, the debate over the status of the stock
market seems to have been settled. ``The stock market is in the
midst of a primary bear market,'' declares Richard Evans, research
director at the investment advisory service Dow Theory Forecasts in
Hammond, Ind.
   Indeed, stocks' current problems started long before October
came into view. They date back to midsummer, when the Dow Jones
industrial average closed for two days running at a peak of
2,999.75.
   From that point through Thursday's close, the average took a
21.16 percent drop.
   Most recently, many Wall Streeters have been inclined to blame
at least some of the market's woes on the White House and members
of Congress and their failure to come up with a plan to manage the
government's finances.
   ``Beyond the budget mania, there is a sick economy to deal
with,'' observed Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities
International in New York.
   At the close on Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average stood
at 2,398.02, down 112.62 from the week before.
   Other readings for the week showed the New York Stock Exchange
composite index down 6.28 at 164.42; the NASDAQ composite index for
the over-the-counter market down 19.80 at 327.56, and the American
Stock Exchange market value index down 12.51 at 293.97.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 156.19 million shares a day,
against 170.70 million the week before.
   The market's malaise is beginning to make some startling
impressions. If stocks don't rally somehow in the next 2{ months,
they will post their worst yearly showing since 1974, when the Dow
fell 27.6 percent.
   Hope dies hard in the financial world, however, and right now
some optimists claim that they at least have contrary opinion on
their side.
   ``We cannot rule out the potential for a near-term advance,
especially some time this month, when everyone is expecting another
horrendous October,'' said Ralph Acampora, an analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities.
   But Acampora adds, ``nothing has surfaced to change my mind
about the primary trend in this market - it is down.''

   The first public airing of allegations that
Michael Milken abused the nation's financial markets opened with
testimony that the junk-bond financier never asked two traders to
illegally manipulate securities.
   A former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. trader also described on
Thursday a secret meeting with Milken where the two discussed in
hushed tones Ivan Boesky's stunning 1986 deal to cooperate in the
Wall Street insider trading probe.
   Milken, 44, took copious notes, shook his head and rolled his

Testimony covered the first of three alleged crimes prosecutors

   NEW YORK (AP) - Dwindling U.S. stockpiles, looming cold weather
and a British warning of a Persian Gulf conflagration combined to
drive oil prices back over $40 a barrel to a new record close in
hectic futures trading.
   The rise to $40.42 Thursday erased the decline a day earlier
when traders dumped oil contracts on an unfounded rumor about the
death of Saddam Hussein.
   The Iraqi leader's seizure of neighboring Kuwait more than two
months ago led to an unprecedented U.S. military buildup in the
petroleum-rich region and has doubled the price of oil since
midsummer.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Chemical Banking Corp. reported a $43.7 million
third-quarter loss and cut its dividend by more than half, another
sign of painful times in the domestic banking business.
   The loss reported Thursday by the nation's 6th-largest banking
company was an improvement over a year earlier but still reflected
the rise in shaky loans and a softening economy that have afflicted
several leading U.S. banks in recent months.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - China is sending more than 200 buyers to the
United States this week to negotiate the purchase of American

government to the United States, arriving as lawmakers debate
whether to extend for another year China's Most Favored Nation

   The step will lower the retailer's debt by $1.5 billion, Macy
said in a statement.
   The announcement Thursday came the same day as grim news that
worries about recession and a possible war in the Persian Gulf kept
consumers on the sidelines in September, giving many storeowners a
dismal month.
   The retailers' monthly sales reports - some of which showed a
decline from September 1989 levels - did not augur well for a

   SPRING HILL, Tenn. (AP) - General Motors Corp. has unveiled its
new Saturn cars and is predicting they will lure more buyers from
the competition than from other GM divisions.
   GM created the Saturn to compete with Japanese imports that have
stolen a large part of the market from the Big Three automakers.
The car, presented during a ceremony Thursday, has a price tag and
fuel efficiency rating that's competitive with Japanese models.
   Don Hudler, Saturn Corp.'s vice president for sales and
marketing, said he expected 65 percent of the GM subsidiary's
first-year sales will be new business to GM. The rest would come
from current GM owners, probably owners of Chevrolets.

   As the wildly swinging price of a barrel of
crude oil grabs headlines and stirs fears of higher inflation, some
folks might wonder: Just what is a barrel of oil?
   Physically, it's the unit by which oil is sold, a relic of early
days in the industry when drillers filled 42-gallon barrels with
crude oil. Nowadays, however, oil is bought and sold in amounts
equivalent to thousands of barrels.
   Crude oil is as it sounds, a raw, unrefined version of the
century's most important fossil fuel.
   Before oil is used by businesses or consumers as gasoline or
other products, it is refined. That is a process of cooking and
distilling that actually turns the 42 gallons of crude into a
little more than 44 gallons of petroleum products, even though
nothing is added.
   ``You do get more product than the crude,'' said Jim Williams of
the American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry's trade group in
Washington.
   ``After you break it up into various gasoline and diesel and
stuff, you've rearranged the molecules. It's just rearranged
differently. You're just changing the chemical makeup of the crude
oil to make it more usable.''
   The 2.03 gallons that appear through the molecular shuffling is
known as the ``processing gain.''
   The refining is done in stages, with the first step occurring as
crude oil is heated at the bottom of a ``distillation tower.''
   The oil turns to gas and rises, with various portions of the
barrel condensing into liquids at different heights of the tower.
At certain points of the tower, the refinery equipment collects the
liquids that can be blended into gasoline. At other levels of the
tower come portions of the oil that can be used in diesel and
kerosene.
   What's left over at the bottom is then put through a similar
tower that has a vacuum at the top and takes out portions of the
oil that were too heavy to be collected the first time out.
   After that stage, the refiner is left with even heavier portions
of the oil barrel that need to be broken up before they are used.
   ``You keep working it down until you can get it into gasoline,''
Williams said. ``The heavier the crude, the more of this you have
to do. Not all refiners can do all of these things.''
   The different steps that must be taken with different barrels of
oil are necessary because all oil is not created equal.
   Crudes range from light sweet, the most desirable blend, to
heavy sour, the least desirable.
   A crude's ``sweetness'' measures its sulfur content. Low-sulfur
or ``sweet'' oil is easier to convert into fuels that meet U.S.
environmental standards. Heavy ``sour'' has lots of sulfur and
takes more refining before it can be used as fuel.
   When the refining is done, a little less than half of the
barrel, 19.50 gallons, has been converted into finished motor
gasoline, statistics from the federal Energy Information
Administration show.
   The other products from a barrel are: distillate fuel oil, 8.61
gallons; jet fuel, 4.20 gallons; residual fuel oil, 2.77 gallons;
petroleum coke, 1.60 gallons;asphalt and road oil, 1.39 gallons;
liquified gases, 1.43 gallons; petrochemical feedstocks, 1.22
gallons; kerosene, 0.25 gallon, finished aviation gasoline, 0.08
gallon; and miscellaneous, 2.98 gallons.

<HEAD>A Dismal September For Retailers Amid Fears of Recession, War</HEAD>

   Nervousness about a possible recession and war in the Persian
Gulf kept consumers out of the stores last month, giving many of
the nation's retailers a dismal September and signalling a
difficult Christmas shopping season.
   ``I don't see anything to suggest an improvement,'' said Jeffrey
Edelman, a retail industry analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd,
after the biggest retailers issued their monthly sales reports
Thursday.
   Several companies said their September sales fell from
year-earlier levels.
   Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., warned,
``It could get worse. ... We believe that for the first time in a
long time, we will have two very poor Christmases back to back.''
   Many retailers were forced to slash prices - and consequently,
their profit margins - to bring in sales last Christmas. Feiner
predicted earnings would decline again in the fourth quarter
although many companies are being very cautious and preparing for
the worst - another bleak holiday season.
   A slump in profits in the final quarter could be devastating for
retailers, who depend on this period for about 50 percent of their
full-year earnings.
   September's results came as no surprise. August sales, which
normally are boosted by back-to-school shopping, showed signs of a
spending slowdown.
   Consumers were already nervous about the economy and the
security of their own jobs when the Persian Gulf crisis and rising
oil prices exacerbated recession fears and gave them less money to
spend on so-called discretionary items such as clothes and
furniture.
   The weather also affected sales, as temperatures ran above the
norm, and few consumers were in the mood to shop for winter
clothing.
   Feiner summed up the confluence of factors as ``a multi-faceted
barrage on the consumer.''
   The nation's largest retailer, Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., said sales
at stores open at least a year rose 4.4 percent for the five weeks
ended Oct. 6, while sales from all of its stores rose 4.2 percent.
   Analysts say sales from stores open at least a year - also known
as same-store or comparable store sales - provide a truer picture
of a retailer's performance than overall sales do. Newer stores
tend to have extraordinarily robust sales that can skew a
retailer's results.
   K mart Corp. said its same-store sales inched up 0.7 percent
although overall sales rose 10.2 percent.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the discount retailer that consistently
outperforms the rest of the industry, reported a same-store sales
gain of 9 percent and a 24 percent rise overall.
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. said its same-store sales fell 3.4 percent,
while overall sales were off 2.3 percent.
   Dayton Hudson Corp. reported a 2 percent decline in same-store
sales, although overall sales were up 11.3 percent.
   Limited Inc., the nation's largest specialty apparel retailer,
said its same-store sales dropped 3 percent, while overall sales
rose 10 percent.
   Thursday's reports also came as bad news for the economy, as
consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the gross
national product. A drop-off in spending adversely affects other
economic sectors, including manufacturers who sell merchandise to
retailers.
   ``Retailers are playing a totally defensive ball game,''
reducing their orders to suppliers, said Feiner.
   The results announced Thursday differ from the monthly retail
sales report from the government. The Commerce Department includes
sales from supermarkets, restaurants and car dealerships in its
figures.
   In other reports from retailers:
   - Woolworth Corp. reported a 2.1 percent gain in same-store
sales, and a 6.2 percent rise overall.
   - May Department Stores Co. said its same-store sales fell 1.8
percent, while overall sales picked up 3.5 percent.

<HEAD>Witnesses Fail To Link Milken Directly to Illegal Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's first two witnesses against
Michael Milken couldn't directly link the former billionaire junk
bond financier to scheming to manipulate a stock with inside trader
Ivan Boesky.
   The first public hearing on charges against Milken after a
four-year probe yielded details about the paranoia and fear that
gripped Milken and others at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. after
Boesky turned state's evidence in 1986.
   Prosecutors have picked three transactions they claim
demonstrate that Milken routinely took advantage of clients and
rigged the financial markets for his own gain. The allegations are
contained in a pre-sentencing memo that urges a stiff sentence for
Milken.
   Under questioning Thursday from government prosecutors and
defense lawyers, former Drexel trader Cary Maultasch and former
Boesky trader Michael Davidoff could not link Milken to the alleged
1986 manipulation of Wickes Co. stock.
   The government alleges that Milken directed Boesky's company to
buy large blocks of stock in Wickes Cos., a Drexel client, in April
1986 to push up its price and help Wickes retire an issue of
preferred shares with costly dividend payments.
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood asked Maultasch whether he had
``any reason to believe that Milken was involved in the decision to
get the Boesky organization to buy Wickes stock.'' The witness
paused before replying, ``No factual basis.''
   Milken, 44, in April pleaded to six separate counts of
conspiracy and fraud and agreed to pay $600 million rather than
face trial on a 98-count indictment. He faces up to 28 years in
prison.
   The government is trying to show that Milken manipulated the
securities markets for his personal benefit. The defense is trying
to prove his crimes were isolated cases of going too far to help
clients.
   ``We find no nobility in cheating for a client to earn fees,''
Assistant U.S. Attorney John Carroll said in an opening statement.
   Milken attorney Arthur Liman countered that the government has
trumped up charges against Milken to encompass the problems of
Drexel, which also admitted felony crimes.
   ``When someone has the visibility and celebrity that Michael
Milken has, it's easy to say that everything that ever happened at
Drexel was his fault,'' Liman said.
   Liman hammered at the witnesses about whether Milken, in fact,
had ever directed them to engage in any illegal behavior, including
insider trading. They were unable to name any.
   Maultasch said Milken never discouraged him from cooperating
with prosecutors and suggested he get his own lawyers, and never
told him to destroy any records, withhold evidence or lie to the
government.
   ``He never criticized you for making a deal to testify against
him?'' Liman said. ``Not to my knowledge,'' Maultasch relied.
   Maultasch, who has been cooperating with the government in
exchange for immunity from prosecution, also testified that he flew
to Beverly Hills in a panic after receiving a subpoena on Nov. 14,
1986, when Boesky's cooperation agreement was announced.
   Maultasch said he met Milken at 4 a.m. in a Drexel conference
room with a guard posted outside the door. In hushed tones, the two
discussed the Boesky securities transactions listed in the
subpoeana. Maultasch said Milken scribbled notes on a yellow legal
pad rather than speaking, but he could not remember specifically
what was said.
   Maultasch said he asked Milken about an October 1986 meeting
with Boesky which had been tape-recorded by the government - and
Milken replied that ``he was careful but he didn't know if he was
careful enough.''
   Milken took frequent notes, shook his head and furrowed his brow
as government prosecutors stated their case during the daylong
proceedings in a packed Manhattan federal court.
   The hearing is to resume Monday with testimony by former Drexel
trader Peter Gardiner, whom Maultasch said told him to ask Davidoff
to purchase the Wickes stock.
   The Boesky organization bought 1.9 million shares of Wickes on
April 23, 1985, helping the stock hit a stipulated closing price at
which the preferred shares could be redeemed.
   The pre-sentencing hearing is scheduled to last two weeks and
each side has 20 hours to present testimony and cross-examine
witnesses. The other transactions to be aired by the government
involve alleged illegal dealings in Caesar's World Inc. and Storer
Communications Inc.

<HEAD>Reporter, Editor Dismissed in Flap Over Personal Investments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The business editor and a reporter at a prominent Southern
newspaper were ousted in a conflict-of-interest dispute that raises
questions about what personal financial activity is appropriate for
journalists.
   Business editor Leonard M. Apcar resigned from the St.
Petersburg (Fla.) Times last week, days after firing banking
reporter James Greiff.
   The episode at the 350,000-circulation Florida daily began late
last month when Greiff disclosed he had been short-selling stock of
Wells Fargo &amp; Co., a San Francisco-based bank.
   After consulting with top editors, Apcar dismissed Greiff on
Oct. 3. Two days later, Apcar quit under pressure after the editors
learned his individual retirement account was invested in a mutual
fund containing Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio.
   Business journalism ethics have received increased scrutiny
since the 1985 insider trading conviction of former Wall Street
Journal reporter R. Foster Winans, who passed along unpublished
tips about his widely read stock market column.
   Several editors and journalism professors contacted about the
St. Petersburg incident drew a simple ethical rule for all media:
Reporters shouldn't own stock or actively trade securities in
industries they are assigned to cover.
   But they also said mutual funds and other passive investments
generally aren't as problematic as profit-oriented trading in the
realm of potential conflicts.
   ``It's part of a journalist's obligation to stay away from
short-term trading of stocks they cover,'' said George Harmon, an
associate professor at Northwestern University's Medill School of
Journalism.
   ``With a mutual fund you're not controlling what stocks that
fund owns,'' said Harmon, a former business editor of the Chicago
Daily News. ``It doesn't seem to me that compromises your
integrity. You don't have any control.''
   Times Managing Editor Mike Foley said the dismissals involved
``a real disagreement'' over the newspaper's conduct guidelines,
which warn against potential conflicts but don't prohibit any
investments specifically.
   ``In neither of these cases did I feel that anything improper
got into the news columns,'' he said.
   In short-selling, an investor sells borrowed stock on the
expectation the price of the issue will decline. The investor
profits if the price drops and the shares, usually borrowed from a
broker, can be replaced at a lower price.
   The risky strategy, forbidden to journalists by at least one
major business publication, amounts to a bet that a company's stock
price will drop.
   Theoretically, a reporter writing a negative article about a
company could ``short'' the stock of that company expecting the
story to drive down the price. Greiff said he had not written about
Wells Fargo. He was accused only of bad judgment, not any
wrongdoing.
   Following Greiff's dismissal, Apcar said he told his immediate
supervisor that he had bank stock in an IRA, but he didn't name the
bank.
   Greiff, meanwhile, said he told Times executives that Apcar held
shares of Banc One, which was mentioned in a story by Greiff the
previous week as a possible suitor for a Florida bank. Apcar had
edited that story and decided his mutual-fund holding presented no
conflict.
   On Oct. 4, after rumors that Apcar owned stock in the bank
filtered through the newsroom, Apcar said he voluntarily told his
supervisor that Banc One was in the IRA. But a day later, Foley
asked Apcar to resign.
   Mutual funds typically contain baskets of different stocks and
other securities. Their contents usually are decided by fund
managers, not investors. In an IRA, investors cannot withdraw money
without penalty until retirement.
   ``You're not in a mutual fund . . . for a short period of
time.'' said Apcar, 37, hired by the Times in early 1989 after more
than 12 years as a Wall Street Journal reporter. ``You're in for
the long haul unless you trade, and I don't trade.''
   The Times' conflict-of-interest policy does not specifically bar
any investments, but cautions reporters to avoid even the
appearance of a conflict and to raise questions with superiors.
   Greiff, 35, a Times reporter for more than five years, said he
did not violate any policy, written or spoken. He said business
writers were told only not to invest in companies they cover or
ones based in Florida.
   ``Within 10 minutes after placing my order with my broker I told
several people in my department and told Len,'' he said. ``I said,
`Do you have any problem with it?' and he said no.'' Apcar said he
did not respond immediately to Greiff's admission.
   ``It went from being no problem to being a problem to being a
firing offense in a matter of a few days,'' Greiff said.
   Rules governing reporters' investments vary widely. Dow Jones &amp;
Co., which owns The Wall Street Journal, has what is considered to
be the strictest conflict-of-interest policy in the nation.
   Reporters and other staffers are barred from short-term trading
and must hold securities at least six months. They cannot trade
futures or options or sell short. Reporters and their families are
prohibited from investing in companies related to their coverage
areas.
   The Society of American Business Editors &amp; Writers' ethics code
urges avoiding even the appearance of conflict. It calls for
skirting ``active trading and other short-term profit-seeking
opportunities.''
   Some editors said newspapers may be at fault if they discipline
reporters without precise guidelines.
   ``If there is no specific policy that makes that clear I think
the newspaper has overreached,'' said Sandra Duerr, business editor
of The Courier-Journal in Louisville, Ky.
   Others said reporters need to be held to the same ethical
standard they apply to their subjects.
   ``If the press as a whole is going to say that politicians
should avoid even the appearance of conflict of interest, then we
should hold ourselves to that extremely high standard,'' said Karen
Rothmyer, an associate professor at Columbia University's
journalism school.

   Here are the domestic September sales and sales for the year to
date reported Thursday by some of the nation's largest retailers.
   Many of the major companies have agreed to issue their monthly
results on the same date, similar to the practice in past years.
Monthly results had been released on different days earlier this
year.
   Some top retailers do not report their sales on a monthly basis,
including R.H. Macy &amp; Co. And, Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., a privately
held retailer, has discontinued releasing its monthly sales.
Reporting periods vary slightly and not all retailers have the same
fiscal year.

<HEAD>Iacocca Gets Neutral Reception From UAW</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN L. ADLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Auto Workers union leaders
had a neutral response to Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca's
explanation of why the company needs a contract different than
pacts reached with GM and Ford.
   ``Well, you see he didn't come out with any bloody nose or
anything,'' UAW spokesman Bob Barbee said Thursday after Iacocca
spoke with negotiators working on a new contract.
   The union had indicated Iacocca was in for a rough time if he
poor-mouthed the No. 3 automaker's situation. Iacocca has earned at
least $4.6 million in salary and bonuses and exercised stock
options worth millions more in the last five years.
   Chrysler, which is expected to say it lost millions when
third-quarter earnings are released later this month, is in the
worst financial shape of the Big Three.
   Iacocca said he neither pleaded poverty nor bargained during his
meeting with the union, which has agreed on a new three-year
contract with General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
   Iacocca refused to say whether he asked the union to abandon
pattern bargaining, in which the contracts with all three are
intended to be virtually identical.
   ``We had a nice hour's discussion,'' Iacocca said. ``I gave them
a state-of-the-union, state-of-the-company message.''
   Talks between the UAW and Chrysler were suspended while the
pattern contract was worked out between GM and the union. The
pattern was adopted at Ford with slight modifications.
   Chrysler previously has bemoaned the cost of health-care
coverage for the company's 67,000 hourly workers. At Chrysler, the
average age is higher than at other U.S. and Japanese automakers.
   ``We took a lot of areas that we said we would have problems
with and we said we would discuss them,'' Iacocca said.
   Most of the anticipated loss for the third quarter is attributed
to down time for retooling at the company's highly profitable
minivan plants.
   Iacocca recently has taken the blame for Chrysler's finances,
saying management mistakes have led to some of the problems. Among
those woes are the lowering of Chrysler's credit rating on Wall
Street to the lowest investment grade, an exodus of top-level
management to retirement or to other companies, and a dearth of new
products for the early 1990s.
   Iacocca was irritated Thursday when asked whether he
acknowledged such mistakes to the union. He said the news media has
missed his point.
   ``The management mistakes are small compared to $1,250 rebates
created by overcapacity from transplants, so put it in
perspective,'' he said. Transplants are Japanese automakers
manufacturing cars in the United States.
   Also Thursday, the Canadian Auto Workers union representing
36,500 GM workers reached a tentative agreement on a three-year
contract.
   The pact mirrors the deal the union reached last month with Ford
of Canada, union president Bob White told a news conference
Thursday. The union expects Chrysler of Canada to follow this
pattern in forthcoming talks, White said.
   The agreement calls for wage hikes of 7.5 percent in the first
year, followed by increases of 6.7 percent and 4.8 percent, in
addition to cost-of-living payments over the life of the contract.

   Saturn cars are expected to pull more
than a third of their first-year sales from other General Motors
Corp. divisions, especially Chevrolet.
   About 65 percent of Saturn's sales during the next year will be
new business for GM, said Don Hudler, Saturn Corp.'s sales and
marketing vice president. The rest will come from people who would
buy other GM cars, he said.
   But by the 1993 model year, about 80 percent of Saturn sales are
expected to come from people lured away from other automakers,
Hudler added.
   ``We'll do better as our perception gets out there,'' Hudler
said after the official unveiling Thursday of Saturn's two- and
four-door cars.
   Saturn's price range of $7,995 to $11,775 puts it in the same
range as a host of imports and with the Geo Prizm and the Cavalier,
both Chevrolets.
   Auto industry analysts have warned about Saturn's
``cannibalization'' of GM sales for some time. That tactic might be
good for Saturn, but doesn't help GM profits.
   GM reported second-quarter earnings of $900 million, compared
with $1.45 billion in the same quarter of 1989.
   Saturn began shipping cars to its 30 open dealers Thursday.
About 1,000 cars will be in dealerships or on their way when Saturn
officially goes on sale Oct. 25 in 30 retailers, mostly in then.''
   Hudler drew cheers and applause from several hundred Saturn
employees who got a 45-minute break from work to participate in the
festivities.
   McWherter, who was state House speaker when GM announced in 1985
that Saturn was coming to Spring Hill 35 miles south of Nashville,
recalled that his father moved their family from Tennessee to
Michigan in search of work in the auto industry.
   ``I want to acknowledge the thousands and thousands of GM
stockholders for their commitment to Tennessee,'' he said before
driving a dark red, four-door sedan out of the plant.
   McWherter and the Saturn executives were joined on stage by
Saturn-United Auto Workers coordinator Dick Hoalcraft and Bobby Lee
Thompson, assistant director of UAW Region 8, who drew applause
when he said he expects Saturn to surprise the imports.
   ``I happen to believe in the Saturn team to get the job done.
But more important, I believe in you, the American public,''
Thompson said to more cheers.
   In the crowd was Jerry Benefield, president of Nissan Motor
Manufacturing Corp. U.S.A., whose company makes Sentras and pickup
trucks 40 miles away.
   ``It's pretty,'' Benefield said of the Saturn.
   Saturn is an American-made car designed to look and drive like
it's Japanese. It is designed to compete with such companies as
Nissan that have taken some of GM's market share.
   ``We're very, very good competitors,'' LeFauve said.
   ``It's guys like Jerry out there making the Nissan look good.
And we're out there trying to make our car look good.
   ``In the end, it's the market that decides.''

<HEAD>Corporate Leaders Cautious About Recession Prospects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOT SPRINGS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy still can avert a
recession, most of the nation's top business leaders said today,
but others contended that a downturn already has begun or is
imminent.
   Even if the economy does skirt a recession, the Business Council
forecast calls for no more than a barely perceptible 0.3 percent
growth during the second half of the year.
   The report prepared for the 100 chief executives of the nation's
largest corporations, holding their semiannual two-day meeting at
this mountain resort, was much more pessimistic than one last
spring projecting moderate growth in the months ahead.
   ``They're much more worried'' than they were at May's meeting,
Lewis T. Preston of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., the council vice chairman,
said of the 19 corporate economists who compiled the forecast.
``Not worried enough, in my judgment.''
   Asked whether he thought the economy already was in a recession,
Preston told reporters, ``I do.'' Several other council members
agreed.
   The council's economic consultants had predicted last spring the
economy would continue to grow moderately at least through 1991.
   ``A clear majority ... still expect slow, but positive, growth
through the middle of 1991,'' their new report said, although five
of the 19 economists projected a recession.
   ``The September survey indicates that economic growth is
expected to slow from the already sluggish 1.1 percent annual rate
in the first half of 1990 to only 0.3 percent in the second half
before gradually accelerating to a 1.2 percent pace in the first
half of 1991 and 2.6 percent in the second half of next year,'' the
report said.
   Although most of the consultants were not forecasting a
recession, they raised the probability of a downturn by year's end
to 39 percent from 22 percent last May. The probability of a
recession by mid-1991 has increased from 29 percent to 47 percent,
the report added.
   ``Indeed,'' it said, ``an informal poll taken at (an Oct. 2
meeting) indicated that a majority of the consultants had further
lowered their growth expectations since the September survey as the
result of additional increases in oil prices and generally weak
economic reports.''
   But the poll found that the economists believe any recession
would be relatively mild and not as severe as the downturns of
1973-75 and 1981-82.
   At the same time, the report said ``there is broad agreement
that the anticipated slowdown will have run its course by the
middle of next year and that the economy will then revert to a more
rapid pace of expansion.''
   ``Not surprisingly, the thing that troubles them the most is the
(Persian) Gulf crisis and the big jump that has occurred in both
crude and product prices,'' Preston said at a news conference.
   Other concerns, he added, are a weaker economy than forecast
last spring and federal budget uncertainties, ``including the
distinct possibility that before this month is over, there could be
a budget crisis or an impasse of crisis proportions.''
   The council report said economic weakness is expected to be
concentrated in housing, consumer spending on durable goods -
usually expensive items expected to last more than three years -
and business investment.
   Other highlights from the forecast:
   -Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index will reach
6.1 percent in the second half of 1990 before slowing to 4.5
percent in the first half of 1991 and 4.2 percent in the second
half of next year.
   -The manufacturing economy will remain weak with orders, sales
and profits showing little or no growth over the next six to nine
months. Industrial production will advance less than 1 percent
through the middle of 1991 but accelerate to a 3.6 percent annual
rate in the second half of 1991.
   -The nation's merchandise trade deficit will continue to improve
because of a lower dollar and strong economies overseas. The gap is
predicted to drop from $109 billion in 1989 to $98 billion this
year and $91 billion in 1991.

   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady is
warning that savings and loan rescues ``will virtually cease within
the next two months'' unless Congress provides more money before it
adjourns.
   Brady, in a letter to the Democratic and Republican leaders of
the congressional banking committees, said $40 billion would carry
the bailout program through the 1991 fiscal year on Sept. 30.
   The money - to cover the losses in failed S&amp;Ls - would be in
addition to the $50 billion authorized under last year's thrift
legislation. It also would be on top of about $60 billion in
short-term borrowing, which would be repaid as regulators sell
assets inherited from bankrupt institutions.
   Brady's letter, released Thursday and dated Wednesday, follows
weeks of pressure from Democrats who said they were reluctant to
provide more money without a specific request from the Bush
administration.
   Earlier, Treasury Department officials had said a range of $40
billion to $80 billion more than last year's $50 billion was needed
for S&amp;Ls, but had not made a specific request.
   Brady said in the letter that it would be appropriate for
Congress to give the administration open-ended spending authority.
Because Congress may not want to go along, however, Brady said it
could provide the $40 billion for the next fiscal year.
   The administration also would accept $20 billion to finance the
program through April, Treasury officials have said.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., created last year to dispose of
failed S&amp;Ls, is ``projecting that RTC case resolutions will
virtually cease within the next two months unless additional funds
are provided,'' Brady said.
   A proposal before the Senate Banking Committee would provide $57
billion. The extra $17 billoon is included to increase the
administration's short-term borrowing authority for S&amp;Ls under a
complex formula in last year's legislation.
   The bill also would cut short a financing mechanism that was
intended to keep $30 billion in S&amp;L spending from showing up in the
federal budget deficit.
   So far, $23 billion has been borrowed through the Resolution
Funding Corp., an off-budget agency known as Refcorp. Under the
bill, the remaining $7 billion would have to be borrowed on-budget
through the Treasury.
   The administration raised $5 billion for Refcorp on Thursday,
selling 30-year bonds at an average interest rate of 9.33 percent.
   At a caucus of House Banking Committee Democrats Wednesday, most
favored providing less than one year's worth of bailout money.

   Stock prices fell on heavy morning losses while the
dollar declined against the yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 195.47 points, or 0.87
percent, ending the day at 22,390.16 in thin trading. An estimated
320 million shares changed hands on first section, up from
Thursday's 300 million.
   The Nikkei stock average, which lost 909.48 points the previous
day, was 449.35 points lower at the end of the morning session due
to index-linked selling from foreign brokerages and Japanese
institutional investors discouraged by continuing declines on Wall
Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 issues has
fallen 158.66 points since Tuesday.
   ``The (Nikkei) index began falling as soon as the early session
started,'' said Tomoya Koda, a trader with New Japan Securities Co.
   The dollar closed at 129.30 yen, 0.65 yen lower than Thursday.
The currency opened higher, but started falling at late morning.
   ``Basically, the dollar is going down, and that's the trend,''
said Masafumi Koyama, a Bank of Tokyo dealer.
   Other dealers said the U.S. currency's rapid fall against the
yen during the past weeks, coupled with concerns by Bank of Japan
Governor Yasushi Mieno that the dollar has been falling too fast,
kept the currency from dropping further.
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government
bonds surged to 83.25 by 4 p.m. from Thursday's 82.24-point finish.
Their yield was lower at 8.090 percent from 8.210 percent.

   The government is predicting that for the rest
of the century the economies of Sun Belt metropolitan areas in the
South and West will grow faster than manufacturing-dependent Rust
Belt cities.
   West Palm Beach, Fla., topped a list of 54 metropolitan areas
whose growth between 1988 and 2000 was estimated in a Commerce
Department report Thursday. The city was first in projected gains
in total personal income, population and employment.
   Other cities ranking in the top 10 in all three categories were:
Phoenix, Ariz.; Orlando, Fla.; Riverside, Calif.; San Diego;
Sacramento, Calif., and Tampa, Fla.
   ``The fastest growing areas ... all benefit from strong
migration flows. ... This has been a part of their economic
development for the past 25 years and the Commerce Department
expects that to continue,'' said economist Mark Zandi of Regional
Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa.
   ``Each of these areas have a good quality of life. Pollution,
congestion, and crime are not problems, for the most part,'' he
said. ``Also, housing affordability, except for Riverside and San
Diego, are still pretty good.''
   Other areas projected to have above-average growth are Anaheim,
Calif.; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Atlanta; Seattle; Jacksonville,
Fla., and Oakland, Calif., the department said.
   The six areas with the slowest projected growth are New Orleans,
New York, Rochester, N.Y.; Pittsburgh, Cleveland and Detroit.
Others expected to grow at a below-average rate are Louisville,
Ky.; St. Louis and Bergen, N.J.
   Zandi said the slower-growing areas, in general, have either a
higher-than-average dependence on manufacturing or on a single
industry, such as oil.
   ``Even though output may be growing in manufacturing, improved
productivity will keep growth in the number of jobs down,'' he
said.
   New York's economy should remain fairly good, Zandi said, but
its growth ranking is low because there is little room left to
expand.
   West Palm Beach was projected to have 48.4 percent total income
growth, adjusted for inflation; 24.8 percent population growth and
30.4 percent job growth.
   Phoenix was second in income growth and third in both job and
population growth.
   New Orleans was the only city predicted to have a population
decline, 0.1 percent, and it had the worst job growth, 6.1 percent.
Rochester showed the smallest predicted inflation-adjusted income
growth, 18.1 percent. New York ranked next to last in all three
areas.
   The Commerce Department also looked at a fourth statistic - per
capita personal income. Cities with the fastest growth predicted in
general ranked low in 1988. Those with the slowest expected growth
for the most part ranked highest in 1988.
   However, San Francisco, with a $26,309 per capita income, was
expected to grow a better-than-average 16.2 percent to $30,582 and
keep its No. 1 ranking.
   The average increase for all 54 cities in each area were: total
personal income, 26.9 percent; population, 10.6 percent;
employment, 15.8 percent, and per capita income, 14.8 percent.
   Among the nation's seven largest metropolitan areas - Los
Angeles, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Boston and
Washington - only Los Angeles and Washington were expected to have
better-than-average economic growth.
   George Downey, an analyst who worked on the report, said the
Commerce Department used recent historical trends to predict the
future. The projections do not take into account such extraordinary
factors as recessions or wars.
   ``These are long-term projections for policy planning - for
people building roads or dams,'' he said.

   There is no safety defect in Jeep CJ vehicles
that would justify taking them off the road, the government's top
safety official says in a ruling bitterly criticized by a consumer
group spokesman.
   Jerry R. Curry, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, said he would not order a recall investigation of
the vehicles, which went out of production in 1986. An estimated
420,000 are still registered for highway use.
   Three consumer organizations had petitioned the agency to
conduct the investigation, saying the vehicles are dangerous
because they frequently overturn.
   ``Americans have the right to make the choice'' to drive theJeep CJ,
Curry said Thursday. ``You have to choose the lifestyle
you want.''
   The retired Army major general said he had ridden thousands of
miles in the World War II jeep, after which the Jeep CJ was
modeled. ``My son-in-law drives a CJ and my two granddaughters ride
in it,'' he said.
   The Jeep CJ is safe if driven carefully, he said, although
agency tests showed it and other light utility vehicles are more
likely to overturn than passenger cars.
   Curry's decision is a ``serious wrongdoing,'' said Ben Kelly,
spokesman for the Institute for Injury Reduction, a non-profit
research and educational group founded by trial lawyers.
   Kelly, a frequent critic of the federal agency during the Reagan
administration, said Curry ``has as little commitment to
eliminating hazardous vehicles from our highways as his
predecessors since 1980.''
   ``For countless Americans, that is a death sentence,'' Kelly
said. ``For the manufacturers, it is a continuing permit to make
unsafe vehicles.''
   The Jeep CJ was manufactured by American Motors Corp., which was
purchased by Chrysler Corp. in 1987.
   Chrysler said in a statement, ``The NHTSA findings confirm that
the Jeep CJ is a safe vehicle and we are pleased that the matter is
now closed.''
   Curry's ruling is the latest twist in a lengthy controversy
surrounding the Jeep CJ. AMC sold 609,356 CJ-5 and CJ-7 vehicles
between 1972 and 1986, when Chrysler replaced the CJ with the
redesigned Wrangler.
   CJ rollover accidents caused 116 deaths in 1989, said Michael
Brownlee, the federal agency's associate administrator for
enforcement.
   Kelly's group joined the Center for Auto Safety and Public
Citizen, groups founded by Ralph Nader, in requesting the NHTSA
investigation. Their petition said the CJ's suspension system was
defective and its roll-bar assembly inadequate.
   It is susceptible to overturning because its wheels are closer
together than those of passenger cars. Also, its center of gravity
is unusually high because the vehicle is built with extra space
underneath to accommodate rough terrain.
   The agency studied all those claims before deciding not to
proceed, Curry said.

<HEAD>House Panel OKs $13 Billion in Farm Program Cuts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than $13 billion in proposed farm program
cuts, devised by the House Agriculture Committee, went today to
congressional budget writers and negotiators on the 1990 farm bill.
   Meeting in closed sesson late into Thursday night, the
committee approved the package by a 26-5 vote.
   The biggest savings - $5.8 billion - would come from a so-called
triple-base plan, which would require farmers to reduce subsidized
acreage by 15 percent in 1992 and 1993, 20 percent in 1994 and 25
percent in 1995.
   ``Pain, pain, pain,'' Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., said after
the panel's work ended. ``I guess we are going to find out what
market-oriented agriculture is all about.''
   He predicted that farmers would see reduced income as a result
of the changes.
   ``To make reductions is very difficult,'' said Agriculture
Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza, D-Texas. `` We hope we spread
it around so it doesn't impact in a negative way (on farmers'
income.)''
   The plan, which reduces agriculture spending by $13.6 billion
over five years, will be considered by the House Budget Committee,
which is working to find $500 billion in savings in total
government spending.
   It also would be woven into the 1990 farm bill, being worked out
in a House-Senate conference committee, if the Senate members of
the committee agree.
   The triple base plan gives farmers flexibility to plant several
different crops on acreage they now are planting in a particular
subsidized or ``program'' crop.
   Currently, farmers keep track of two so-called ``base'' land
areas: the acres they plant in certain crops and land they leave
idle at the demand of the government.
   Under the new plan, farmers would create a third base of acreage
that they could plant in any program crop (wheat, corn, feed
grains, rice or cotton); oilseeds, industrial crops, experimental
crops or other commodities for which no substantial domestic
production exists. This acreage would not be subsidized, but would
give farmers the flexibility to answer market demands for certain
food preferences.
   Other savings would be achieved by calculating deficiency
payments on an average price over 12 months instead of an average
of the first five months after harvest, when market prices are
lowest. The government pays farmers the difference between its
target price and the market price, and at harvest time that
difference is greatest.
   Other major money saving proposals include:
   -Shifting 25 percent of Rural Electric Administration and all
but $500 million of Farmers Home Administration direct loans to
private lenders.
   -Putting a 1 percent user fee on loans for dairy, sugar,
tobacco, peanuts, honey, wool and mohair and a 4 percent fee on
soybean loans.
   -Setting soybean marketing loans at $5.02.
   -Having a 1991 reduction in wheat acreage of 15 percent.
   -Establishing user fees for the Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service.
   A new $5.295 billion expansion of the food stamp and nutrition
programs in the 1990 farm bill would be retained if House Budget
Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., is able to find money
from other sources, de la Garza said.
   Meanwhile, on the House floor Thursday, the Agriculture
Committee fought off an effort by Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., to
instruct the House farm bill negotiators to insist that, at
minimum, pesticide export controls in the House version of the farm
bill be adopted.
   The motion, which failed 248-162, also would have required the
House conferees to agree to provisions in the Senate bill that
require the government to immediately stop allowing any produce
into the United States that carries the residue of a banned
pesticide.
   De la Garza pledged to fight for the provision, but he said he
was insulted that Synar took the issue to the floor as if he didn't
respect the chairman's ability to negotiate for it.
   On another instruction to House conferees, the House voted,
255-154, to insist that $10 million be authorized annually in
fiscal years 1991 through 1995 for a public education program on
the hazards of tobacco use.

<HEAD>China Opens Grain Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLENE L. FU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In one of its few economic reforms this year,
China opened a national wheat market Friday to replace central
allocation of the nation's 85 million ton annual wheat harvest.
   More than 200 grain trading companies were to begin dealing on
opening day at the Wholesale Grain Market in Zhengzhou, the
provincial capital of Henan, China's wheat heartland, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported.
   The market is one of China's few experiments in using markets to
replace four decades of central planning. Most other reform
initiatives were halted two years ago when conservatives accused
the reformists of overheating the economy and generating market
chaos.
   The Zhengzhou market's opening was delayed two years by
inadequate planning and ideological reservations. Some conservative
officials have denounced futures trading as speculative.
   But the Zhengzhou market was allowed to proceed because it will
help the government manage grain distribution, long a serious
problem. Although the government buys most grain grown in China, it
lacks a network of modern storage facilities, and in bumper years
much grain is left to rot outdoors. Serious shortages have occurred
in some regions while others have surpluses.
   China still lacks wholesale markets for the 169 million metric
tons of rice, its main crop, harvested annually.
   Most of the wheat will be sold for future delivery, a key
element of a futures market. However, William D. Grossman, managing
director of the Chicago Board of Trade's Asia-Pacific office, said
the operatio  lacks another element of a true futures market,
standardized contracts.
   The Board of Trade, the world's largest futures market, has been
training and advising Chinese personnel but will not be involved in
the market's management.
   A futures market allows buyers and sellers to negotiate a price
for what they think a commodity will be worth at a future date. The
price holds regardless of subsequent market changes.
   ``The most immediate effect will be to promote circulation. In
the long term, it will promote price discovery,'' Grossman said.
   Until now, state grain bureaus in each province had to go
through the central government to buy or sell wheat to other
provinces, setting a price through negotiation. The Zhengzhou
market streamlines the process by bringing buyers and sellers
together. Individual farmers will still sell their wheat to the
state and will not be allowed to participate in trading.
   Commerce Minister Hu Ping said in June that the market will set
maximum and minimum prices. If the price threatens to go above the
ceiling, the market will automatically close. If there are no
offers to buy at the minimum price, the state will buy the wheat.
   Only dues-paying members will be allowed to trade, said
Grossman, and foreigners will be excluded. Traders will be mostly
state farms and large consumers like breweries and noodle
factories.
   Grossman has likened the Zhengzhou market to the Chicago Board
of Trade when it opened in 1848. It took 20 years before the
Chicago market developed from a cash market to a futures market.
   Chinese news reports say the government is considering a futures
market for corn, rice and pigs.

   Retail sales jumped 1.1 percent in September,
artificially inflated by the soaring cost of gasoline, the
government said Friday.
   Sales rose $1.6 billion to a seasonally adjusted $151.2 billion,
the Commerce Department said. That followed a revised 0.4 percent
decline in August, which had previously been reported as a 0.6
percent drop. September's gain was the best since an identical rise
four months earlier.
   August sales too were bolstered by rising gasoline prices, which
took off after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. Service station sales
were up 7 percent in August. Excluding gasoline, sales fell a
steeper 0.9 percent in August and rose a lower 0.8 percent in
September.
   Last month's performance also was helped by a rebound in auto
sales, which have been slipping most of the year.
   Auto sales rose 2.9 percent to $31.1 billion in September after
falling 3.7 percent a month earlier. Despite the gain, they were
still 4.9 percent behind last year.
   Factoring out the volatile auto category, sales rose 0.6 percent
last month following a 0.5 percent rise in August.
   Sales at department stores, one of the best gauges of consumer
sentiment, were down 0.9 percent last month to $17.6 billion. That
is being taken as a sign that the Persian Gulf crisis and
lackluster economic performance in general continue to shake
consumer confidence.
   In a separate private report on Thursday, major retail chains
reported disappointing results for last month.
   According to the Commerce Department, all retail sales in the
July-September quarter were only 2.8 percent higher than the same
period a year earlier. That is not enough to account for rising
prices.

   Sales of durable goods, ``big ticket'' items intended to last
three or more years, such as major appliances and autos, rose 1.4
percent in September, following a 0.5 percent gain the month
before.
   Non-durable goods sales climbed 0.9 percent after a 0.8 percent
gain in August.
   In specific categories, the government said:
   -Hardware, garden and building supply stores reported sales
dropped 0.5 percent.
   -Furniture sales rose 0.7 percent.
   -Food store receipts rose 1.6 percent.
   -Clothing and accessory store sales fell 1.5 percent.
   -Restaurant and bar sales increased 1 percent.
   -Drug store sales were up 0.4 percent.

   California has adopted the nation's
toughest air-quality standards for household products, ordering a
45 percent cut in smog-forming pollutants from such items as hair
spray, window cleaner and floor wax.
   The order Thursday by the Air Resources Board will be phased in
from 1993 to 1998 and could add up to 23 cents to the price of the
16 types of products covered, said Jim Boyd, ARB executive officer.
   Products covered include engine degreaser, windshield washer
fluid, furniture polish, room air freshener, laundry prewash, nail
polish remover, insect repellent, oven cleaner, hair styling gel
and mousse, tile cleaner and shaving cream.
   When fully in force, the rules would eliminate about 45 tons per
day of hydrocarbon emissions, an amount equal to the emissions of
about 1.4 million vehicles. Currently the household products emit
about 100 tons of hydrocarbons a day.
   ``No other state has adopted regulations that are these
comprehensive,'' William Sylte, the board's chief deputy executive
officer. The federal government, he added, does not yet regulate
such product hydrocarbon emissions.
   The regulations stemmed from a 1988 California law requiring a
crackdown on hydrocarbons in hair sprays, cleaners and other
consumer goods. ``The federal government has taken so long in
getting around to this, that the California Legislature went ahead
and authorized'' the stringent regulations, Sylte said.
   Hydrocarbons are contained in chemicals used in the manufacture
of some of the products or are found in the propellants of others.
   ``Once they escape into the atmosphere, however, they react with
other pollutants to form urban smog in the same way as hydrocarbons
from tailpipe exhaust,'' Boyd said.
   Despite potential cost increases, he said, ``we expect that
virtually all of the products currently offered to consumers will
continue to be available, and all of them will be environmentally
more acceptable than what is on store shelves today.''
   The ARB said some new hair sprays - six aerosol and 24 pump
sprays - already have substantially lower hydrocarbons. Hair spray
is the No. 1 producer of household hydrocarbons, followed by
windshield washer fluid and room air fresheners.
   The regulations are patterned after similar rules governing
paints, industrial degreasers, deodorants and antiperspirants.
   Thursday's order marked the second major environmental decision
by the ARB in two weeks.
   In the earlier ruling, the ARB adopted the world's strictest
pollution standards for new automobiles, requiring all cars built
between 1994 and 2003 to be up to 85 percent less polluting than
today's models. The decision also required production of
nonpolluting electric cares by 1998.
   The state also has has cut emissions from factories.
   ``We won't meet health standards without controlling these
(household) emissions, too,'' Boyd said.

   Tektronix Inc. said it will sell or shut
down its unprofitable workstation business within 60 days, and the
company gave layoff notices to about 175 employees.
   If it can find a buyer for the business, many of those workers
would be re-employed, company spokesman Doug Babb said Thursday.
   Otherwise, they will join the more than 2,000 Tektronix
employees who have been laid off since the beginning of the year.
The company has laid off or lost by attrition about half of the
more than 24,000 employees it had nine years ago.
   ``We made the decision it is time to put our resources behind
other products,'' Babb said.
   He said flat-panel computer displays and liquid crystal color
shutters, an advanced technology for color computer screens, are
two promising areas where Tektronix is focusing its efforts.
   Workstations, which are powerful desktop computers used in
design work and other areas, face tough competition. The market is
dominated by other brands, particularly Sun Microsystems Inc. and
Hewlett-Packard Co.'s Apollo division.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Propel Britain's Inflation To 10.9 Pc</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Higher oil prices propelled Britain's annual
inflation rate to 10.9 percent in September, its highest level in
nearly nine years, but politicians predicted the worst may be over.
   Although inflation is peaking, the worse-than-expected figures
for September suggest that a decline in the rate will not be as
fast as had been hoped, economists said.
   ``A bit of a shock'' is the way Ian Harwood, an economist at the
London investment firm Warburg Securities, described the news.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Friday that inflation
``will soon begin to decline.'' Linking the pound to Europe's
currency system earlier this week ``will reinforce our own
financial discipline against it,'' she said.
   Britain has the worst inflation among the major industrialized
nations despite Mrs. Thatcher's efforts to the contrary. She has
said fighting inflation is her No. 1 economic priority.
   Mrs. Thatcher, speaking at the Conservative Party's annual
conference, said that ``signs are clear'' that the government's
interest rate policy is working. She made reference to a cut in
base rates by one percentage point to 14 percent earlier this week.
   Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major told reporters the hike
in inflation was ``where we thought it would be.''
   In his speech to the conference on Thursday, Major warned that
recent increases in oil prices had yet to appear fully in the
inflation statistics. But he also predicted inflation would fall
sharply next year.
   The 10.9 percent rate was the highest level since inflation
stood at 11 percent in February 1982 and compared with a rate of
10.6 percent in August, the government said.
   The underlying level of annual inflation, which excludes
mortgage payments and a per-capita tax, rose to 8.3 percent in
September from 7.9 percent in August.
   Retail prices rose 0.9 percent in September from the previous
month. The government blamed the hike on a sharp increase in
gasoline prices to an average of $4.55 a gallon, from $4.20 in
August. Oil prices have risen sharply since Iraq invaded Kuwait on
Aug. 2.
   There also were price increases in a wide range of other goods
and services.
   The financial markets, which had expected a 10.8 percent figure,
reacted calmly to the news.
   ``September will be the peak,'' Harwood said. ``The bad news
however, is that the unexpected robustness (in the underlying rate)
means the fall in the rate will be less than expected.''
   Gwyn Hache, an economist with James Capel and Co., said what was
worrisome was that non-oil prices rose more than expected.
   Although Harwood expects inflation to fall below 10 percent by
the end of the year, he said forecasts that it will fall to 5
percent or lower in 1991 are proving optimistic.

   The stock market edged upward today, bidding to
pull out of the slide of the past three sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down more than 158
points from Tuesday through Thursday, rose 3.96 to 2,369.06 by 11
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 615 up, 596 down and 530
unchanged.
   Analysts said stocks appeared to be experiencing a technical
rally, aided by a modest downturn in bond-market interest rates.
   But they added that the economic and financial news offered
little evidence of lasting relief from the recession worries that
have plagued the market for several months.
   The Labor Department reported that the wholesale price index of
finished goods jumped 1.6 percent in September, propelled by
surging energy prices.
   Negative news had been widely anticipated from the index, which
provides a measure of inflationary pressures in the distribution
pipelines of the economy. Still, brokers said, the figure served as
a damper on whatever hopes existed for a relaxation of the Federal
Reserve's credit policy any time soon.
   Chemical Banking fell 2\ to 12{. On Thursday the bank holding

   Wholesale prices shot up 1.6 percent in
September as turmoil in the Persian Gulf battered the U.S. economy
and fueled a record-breaking jump in gasoline prices, the
government reported today.
   The Labor Department blamed virtually all of the steep increase
on higher oil costs that persisted in September following Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   A 20.6 percent increase in gasoline last month was the highest
one-month increase recorded since the government began tracking the
commodity in 1947, the government said.
   ``The oil shock is hitting with a vengeance and it's coming at a
time when inflation overall is still untamed. ... It's just one
more jolt to an already fragile economy,'' said Robert Dederick,
chief economist at the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.
   Last month's rise in the Producer Price Index - the biggest jump
in wholesale inflation since a cold snap sent prices up 1.9 percent
in January - followed a similarly sharp increase of 1.3 percent in
August. That surge was also blamed on higher energy costs brought
on by the gulf crisis.
   It was the biggest two-month jump in producer prices since 1980,
the government said.
   In another economic report today, the Commerce Department said
retail sales jumped 1.1 percent in September, bolstered by the
soaring cost of gasoline. Excluding gasoline, sales rose 0.8
percent during the month. Overall, sales rose $1.6 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $151.2 billion, the Commerce Department said.
   The fallout from the Persian Gulf conflict has heightened
analysts' fears that higher inflationary pressures will aggravate
an already staggering U.S. economy.
   Many economists believe, in fact, that the nation has already
slipped into recession. The oil shock threatens to ``intensify the
downturn, deepen it, perhaps lengthen it,'' said Allen Sinai, chief
economist at the Boston Co.
   Analysts said the inflation outbreak, coupled with today's
relatively positive retail sales report, deepens the dilemma for
the Federal Reserve. The central bank has been under pressure from
the Bush administration to ease its inflation-fighting campaign and
lower interest rates to spur the economy.
   ``How in the world can the Fed ease? The consumer at least
hasn't rolled over and inflation is rebelling. The two (reports)
give a further reason for the Fed to remain frozen in its current
posture,'' Dederick said.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``Inflation
going up is never good news.'' He declined to criticize the Federal
Reserve's apparent tight monetary policy.
   ``We still are concerned about growth and about preventing a
recession. We think the Fed has recognized all these factors and is
on the right course,'' Fitzwater said.
   The September rise in wholesale prices would translate into an
annual increase of 20.9 percent if prices rose that much each
month, the government said.
   That is far above the 3 percent advance, at an annual rate, in
the Producer Price Index from January through July, before the
Middle East erupted. With August and September increases figured
in, wholesale inflation has increased at an annual rate of 6.3
percent so far in 1990, the government said.
   In September, energy costs overall rose 13.8 percent, the
biggest one-month jump since the government began tracking that
statistic in 1974, the government said. Gasoline jumped 20.6
percent while fuel oil rose 21.3 percent. Natural gas was up 1.3
percent, today's report said.
   Food prices, meanwhile, were down 0.9 percent after rising 0.8
percent in August. Fresh fruit prices fell 3.6 percent while
vegetables were down 4.8 percent.
   Egg prices, which had soared 25.8 percent in August, fell 7.0
percent, the government said,
   Costs were down for rice, pasta, beef and pork. They were up for
bakery products, chickens and turkeys.
   Prices for goods excluding the volatile food and energy items -
often taken by economists as a better barometer of underlying
inflationary pressures - rose 0.6 percent. In August, this
so-called core rate rose 0.3 percent.
   Passenger car prices were up a sharp 3.4 percent after having
risen 0.8 percent in August, the government said.
   Clothing prices were up slightly for women's, men's and boys'
apparel but fell 0.7 percent for girls', children's and infants'
clothing. Footwear rose 0.4 percent.
   Tobacco prices rose 1.2 percent and were 13.6 percent higher
than they were a year ago.
   Inflation at earlier stages of the production process was up
sharply, too, largely due to the gulf crisis, the Labor Department
said. Crude goods jumped 4.6 percent while intermediate goods
jumped 1.8 percent.
   An example of the three processing stages would be clothing for
finished goods, cloth for intermediate and cotton for crude.
   The various changes put the Producer Price Index for all
finished goods at 120.3 in September. That means a hypothetical
selection of goods that cost $100 in 1982 cost $120.30 last month,
up from 113.60 a year earlier.
   The Consumer Price Index, which measures the price of goods and
services at the retail level, is due out next week.
   Analysts are worried that the current inflation outbreak is
likely to become more entrenched, filtering through to the
thousands of plastic, chemical and other products made with
petroleum. Oil also figures into products that must be transported
long distances and shows up in utility costs, too.

<HEAD>Northwest Proposes Layoffs or Pay Cuts to Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The machinists' union at Northwest
Airlines said today it is considering a proposal by Northwest
Chairman Alfred Checchi that it choose between laying off workers
or taking a 10 percent pay cut for six months.
   Checchi, whose airline faces soaring jet fuel costs, made the
proposal Wednesday night to Guy Cook, president of the
24,400-member International Association of Machinists at Northwest,
the Saint Paul Pioneer Press reported today. It quoted unidentified
sources.
   Cook today generally confirmed the report, but said the number
of layoffs is ``up in the air.'' He said figures of ``ten, fifteen
and 20 percent were all mentioned.''
   ``Another possible scenario is management paying attention to
some areas to cut costs,'' Cook said. ``I have mentioned that to
Checchi.''
   Cook said he planned to respond later today to Checci's offer.
The union covers mechanics, baggage handlers, reservations agents
and other ground personnel.
   Northwest would not confirm or deny that a proposal was made.
   ``All I can say is the airline has for some time now been
considering ways in which we can control expenses in light of
higher jet fuel costs,'' company spokesman Doug Miller said.
``We're looking at a number of possibilities but haven't made any
decision.''
   Northwest employs about 44,000 workers, about 16,500 in
Minnesota. A 15 percent cut would amount to 6,600 jobs.
   Other big airlines, including USAir, Pan American World Airways,
Trans World Airlines and industry heavyweight American Airlines,
have already announced layoffs to cope with a sluggish economy and
a 65 percent increase in fuel prices. The fuel price run-up,
sparked by Middle East turmoil, could add $800 million to $1
billion a year to Northwest's tab for fuel.
   Duane Woerth, chairman of the 5,600-member Northwest Air Line
Pilots Association union, said he planned to meet with Checchi
today.
   He said contract provisions with Northwest do not allow the
carrier to lay off any pilots until mid-February. The provision was
triggered by the airline's participation in government programs to
allow Northwest pilots and jets to shuttle U.S. troops to the
Middle East.
   He said the provisions also restrict layoffs to pilots hired
since Aug. 28, 1989. Union figures suggest only 273 pilots would be
vulnerable to layoff after mid-February.
   ``If the goal is to prevent layoffs, that's something we can
help construct,'' Woerth said, suggesting vacation schedules could
be juggled to help avert job cuts.

<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With companies so computer-dependent, how can
they to business if a hurricane or earthquake hits or their
equipment is knocked out by a power outage or busted water pipe?
   Mostly likely they don't, unless they have a plan to quickly
retrieve enough data to function.
   But what good is the information when the company can't get it
because the computer system is flooded, burned, leveled or the
victim of a brownout?
   That's where the disaster recovery industry comes in, says Ira
Josowitz, who helped set up International Business Machines Corp.'s
year-old, $50 million Business Recovery Services Center in Tampa.
   Recovery planning is becoming big business as sophisticated
computer systems take over more of the corporate workload. A wide
range of businesses from ``mom and pop'' operations to industry
giants have elaborate and expensive contingency plans they hope
they never have to use.
   ``You do it so you can continue to operate. It's good and
prudent business,'' said Tom Green of Price Waterhouse, a major
accounting and consulting firm.
   ``Tampa is a flood-prone, lightning-prone, brownout-prone
environment. If something can go wrong, this is the place for it,''
said Green, who is among IBM's customers in the U.S., Canada and
the Caribbean.
   IBM is a fledgling in the competitive disaster recovery market,
which traces its roots to the 1970s.
   ``IBM got into the disaster recovery business last year to help
customers prepare for calamities like hurricanes and earthquakes
that can wipe out data and computer systems that are vital to their
businesses,'' said Mike Hill, regional manager.
   A company - large or small - can be back in business in a matter
of hours at IBM's ``hot site,'' a corporate home-away-from-home.
   Executives notify IBM they're in trouble and retrieve critical
backup tapes from a vault or storage site sometimes as far as 1,000
miles away. They summon key personnel who will keep the company
alive from the remote laboratory while recouping from the disaster.
   At IBM, three suites are ready. More are planned next year to
eventually accommodate 12 customers simultaneously. The largest
command center could handle a small army of corporate officials
with 15 computer terminals, monitors, phone banks and IBM staff
trained to assist.
   A 5,000-square-foot room is stuffed with communications
equipment in 6-foot-tall cabinets. Another room four times that
size holds state-of-the-art processors which can handle a billions
of bits of information.
   Cost to a business for this risk-insurance is not cheap. It runs
from $125 to $50,000 a month, depending on company size. Businesses
get 72 hours of on-site testing - fire drills to work out the bugs.
If they declare a disaster and have to use the site, there's an
added fee of $50,000 for the first 48 hours and $25,000 a day for
up to six weeks.
   If more time is needed, they can bring in equipment and set up
at the facility, free of charge.
   Among IBM's 600 customers are insurance companies,
manufacturers, retailers, brokerage houses, and service providers
such as hospitals and municipalities. eu
   IBM has another key site in Franklin Lakes, N.J., and other
smaller recovery facilities in Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington,
Philadelphia, Detroit, Atlanta and one being built in Dallas.
   Coopers &amp; Lybrand, a top accounting-consulting firm with
operations in 104 countries, has joined IBM in a disaster
partnership to help customers devise a recovery plan - a process
which takes several months.
   ``IBM provides the technology, we provide the plan so the
business can survive,'' said Leonard Gilbert, a Miami-based partner
for Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
   Gilbert said hundreds of businesses devastated when Hurricane
Hugo went ashore last year in the Carolinas didn't have a disaster
plan and never came back.
   ``These were the ones that didn't have files, key personnel
ready or a program in place. There were no automatic tellers to
withdraw money. Customers outside the disaster zone called in, but
lines were down or no one was there if they got through. The
customers went somewhere else,'' Gilbert said.
   ``It all depends on how long you can be out of business with
your computers down,'' he said. ``Computers are the lifeline of
companies today and a disaster recovery plan is something they need
to have to survive.''

   The stock market turned upward today, rebounding
from the slide of the past three sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down more than 158
points from Tuesday through Thursday, rose 27.23 to 2,392.33 by 2
p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 827 up, 625 down and
461 unchanged.
   Analysts said stocks appeared to be experiencing a technical
rally, aided by a modest downturn in bond-market interest rates.
   In addition, oil prices dropped amid conjecture that chances
might be improving for some break in the stalemate with Iraq in
Kuwait.
   But brokers also said the economic and financial news offered
little evidence of lasting relief from the recession worries that
have plagued the market for several months.
   The Labor Department reported that the wholesale price index of
finished goods jumped 1.6 percent in September, propelled by
surging energy prices.
   Negative news had been widely anticipated from the index, which
provides a measure of inflationary pressures in the distribution
pipelines of the economy. Still, brokers said, the figure served as
a damper on whatever hopes existed for a relaxation of the Federal
Reserve's credit policy any time soon.
   Chemical Banking fell &rsqb; to 12~ on top of a 1}-point loss
Thursday, when the bank holding company reported a $43.7 million
loss for the third quarter and cut its quarterly dividend from 68
cents a share to 25 cents a share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
2.05 to 164.25. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .17 at 293.54.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 123.92 million shares with two
hours to go.

<HEAD>Slumping Economy Cuts Into Tax Rolls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The slumping economy cuts into cities' and
states' tax collections, turning up budget shortfalls that make
municipal bond investors wary and intent on getting higher returns
for their risk.
   New York City, Philadelphia and Massachussetts have been the
most recent and widely publicized of those in the credit-rating
doghouse because of widening gaps between the costs of services and
revenues.
   Standard &amp; Poors Corp. last week placed New York City on its
``credit watch'' list, meaning the bond rating agency is reviewing
the city's ability to pay interest and principal on its $13 billion
in general obligation bonds. Philadelphia's debt, meanwhile, has
been downgraded to junk bond status by both S&amp;P and Moody's
Investors Services Inc. Massachuessetts' recent offering of $1.035
billion of general obligation bonds got a low rating that forced
yields of nearly 8 percent at auction.
   As credit ratings go down, yields go up. That means
municipalities already struggling to make ends meet have the added
burden of paying higher interest rates to borrow money.
   Investors have driven up the yields for New York City bonds in
the past week. For Philadelphia, the city couldn't even get access
to the market for its annual sale of about $375 million in
short-term notes amid predictions by city officials that it would
run out of money by Dec. 1.
   The most serious problems have been confined to the Northeast.
However, there have been problems in Florida as tax collections
have been hurt by the souring housing market. Would-be immigrants
to Florida from the Northeast have had trouble selling their homes.
   Tax collections have slowed in Illinois, Michigan and Ohio.
``Their manufacturing base and exports continue to do well, but
that may catch up with them,'' said Hyman C. Grossman, managing
director at S&amp;P in charge of municipal bonds. Analysts also note
some concern for southern California.
   While for some cities and states the tide of severe economic
troubles has yet to come, others have been able to help their
credit rating steady by keeping spending in line with revenues.
   ``Sometimes you have to put a leash on spending and its a tough
political issue. Those who can respond without raising taxes all
the time have the answer,'' Grossman said.
   Before management can lead a municipality through tough economic
times, there has to be the political will to make unpopular
decisions, said Neal Atterman, vice president and director of
municipal research at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   ``Management by the chief executive and a political meeting of
the minds between the legislative branch and the executive as to
how to deal with problem'' is key for negotiating a strong credit
rating though economic uncertainty,'' Atterman said.
   While the liklihood that some municipal bond issuers may miss an
interest payment or two is growing, the chances of a long-term
serious default on any issue is remote, analysts say.
   Municipal bonds are basically IOUs issued states and local
governments to raise money to build highways, bridges, schools,
hospitals, etc.
   Revenue bonds have been traditionally viewed as less secure
because they depend on income from a specific project, such as
bridge tolls, to pay interest and principal. General obligation
bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the issuer, who
can draw interest and principal payments from general funds.
   But it has been the general obligation bonds that have come
under pressure lately, partly due to the poor real estate market
that has pushed down property assessments.
   The slow housing market has been at the root of the Northeast's
problems, analysts say, but many cities and states are getting
caught between programs mandated by a higher level of government
and an eroding tax base.

   The Italian national airline Alitalia
ordered 20 Airbus passeger jetliners Friday, bringing its total
order for the new model to 60 aircraft, including 20 options.
   Jean Pierson, administrator of the Airbus Industrie consortium,
said the 40 firm orders are valued at $3.1 billion.
   The Italian airline had been the first to buy the new A321 model
short- to medium-range aircraft and now has ordered more than any
other customer, Pierson said.
   The first will be delivered by spring 1994 and will be used on
the airline's internal, European and Mediterranean services.
   The A321 is a longer, fuel-efficient version of the twin-engine
A320 and holds 191 passengers. It has a 1,100-mile range.
   Airbus Industrie has 131 firm orders for the aircraft.
   The Toulouse-based Airbus consortium consists of four aircraft
manufacturers from France, Germany, Great Britain and Spain.

<TEXT>
   Colgate-Palmolive Co. has become the first
company to place its ads on Soviet buses, officials said Friday.
   The New York-based consumer products company signed a contract
for the ads with Transportation Displays Inc., a company that
places ads on transit facilities.
   The Colgate ads, promoting toothpaste the company has started
selling in the Soviet Union, will appear on the sides of buses in
Moscow and Kiev, the capital of the Ukraine, Colgate and TDI said.
   ``Colgate - the World's Most Popular Toothpaste,'' the signs say
in large Cyrillic letters. The ads were developed by Young &amp;
Rubicam.
   Colgate says the ads are part of its strategy to develop
increased awareness of its products among Soviet consumers and
dentists.
   TDI obtained the exclusive right to place ads on transportation
vehicles in major Soviet cities in March.
   ``Colgate-Palmolive's pioneering decision to advertise on TDI's
network will undoubtedly pave the way for other American
advertisers,'' said Howard Ziff, who is in charge of TDI's Soviet
operation.

<HEAD>KLM Cuts Jobs in Wake Of Rising Oil Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMSTELVEEN, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   KLM Royal Dutch Airlines
announced Friday it was cutting 500 jobs and warned that rising jet
fuel prices and a weak dollar could wipe out profits this fiscal
year.
   The company also may cut part of its foreign network as part of
a $231 million cost-cutting plan over the next three years, said
KLM spokesman Hugo Baas.
   But an industry analyst said the measures were too little, too
late.
   Rob Sweers, head of institutional investment at the Parisbas
bank in Amsterdam, noted that the cuts represent only a small
percentage of KLM's total workforce of 25,000.
   ``Under the present circumstances, it may not be enough,'' he
said.
   Prices of jet fuel have skyrocketed in recent weeks because of
tensions in the Middle East, and all the major airlines have felt
the effects.
   At the same time, the U.S. dollar, on which KLM's international
ticket sales are based, has been sliding to lows not seen in years.
   Baas warned that unless both trends are reversed, KLM will
probably face a loss in the current fiscal year.
   The airline also blames its troubles on the low cost of labor in
the Far East, which allows competitors there to operate more
economically. ``We are living in a totally different social
system,'' said Baas, referring to the relatively high social
welfare costs that boost European wages.
   The layoffs will take place in the Netherlands, where 19,000 of
KLM's personnel are based.
   KLM had net income of 340 million guilders, or $197 million, in
the fiscal year ending March 31.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financial News Network, the 24-hour
business-oriented cable television service, said Friday it fired a
top executive for improper financial dealings and dismissed its
auditors.
   The company said two other employees in the accounting staff
were put on leave while FNN reviews their ``status.''
   Chief Financial Officer C. Steven Bolen, 44, was dismissed
following a board investigation that concluded he ``received
compensation payments that were not properly authorized and . . .
that certain bank accounts administered under (his) direction were
not properly recorded.''
   Bolen has been on leave since summer, when questions about
payments to him first surfaced, said sources close to FNN who spoke
on condition they not be identified.
   Bolen, who had been with the company for about five years and
worked out of its Los Angeles office, earned $185,000 annually. No
charges have been filed against him.
   Bolen could not be located for comment.
   FNN said in a statement that it believes all the funds have been
accounted for. FNN spokeswoman Amber Gordon would not comment on
how much money was involved.
   Separately, FNN and Infotechnology Inc., which owns 47 percent
of the news service as well as 97 percent of United Press
International, said they have terminated the services of their
accounting firm, Deloitte &amp; Touche.
   A committee comprised of FNN board members recommended the
termination because it didn't think the firm ``would be able to
complete the audit work in a timely fashion.''
   Deloitte, in turn, notified FNN, Infotechnology and its UPI
subsidiary, that the financial statements it prepared for them
should no longer be relied upon.
   Deloitte said it was withdrawing its 1989 opinion of FNN's
financial health because of fresh information concerning some
transactions between FNN and UPI, as well as questions about 1989
financial statements by Bolen.
   FNN since has retained Coopers &amp; Lybrand as its auditors.
   FNN provides business and market news and sports news on 3,500
cable systems throughout the United States and Canada. The company
said its broadcasts reach 35 million homes.

<HEAD>Grain Futures Fall, Paced By Wheat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade as selling pressure from
the wheat market eroded the support of a bullish corn and soybean
crop report.
   Wheat futures fell moderately amid speculative selling that
reflected abundant wheat supplies and slack demand, the same
factors that have weighed on wheat prices for several months.
   Thursday's monthly Agriculture Department crop report contained
slightly lower corn and soybean harvest estimates than traders had
expected, which gave those markets an early boost,
   But a more significant number in the report was a prediction
that U.S. soybean stockpiles will fall from about 250 million
bushels to 175 million by Sept. 1, 1991, analysts said.
   Gerald Zusel, manager of Balfour Maclaine Corp.'s floor
operations at the Board of Trade, said the stockpile number may not
provide much support for near-term prices but indicates that
soybean prices may rise sharply over the next 11 months.
   At the close, wheat futures were 4 cents to 6 cents lower with
the contract for delivery in December at $2.67 a bushel; corn was
2{ cents lower to 1\ cents higher with December at $2.30\ a bushel;
oats were \ cent to { cent lower with December at $1.19\ a bushel;
soybeans were 1\ cents lower to 4\ cents higher with November at
$6.20 a bushel.

   An industrial park in Windsor, Ontario, has

by National Steel Corp. and companies from Canada and Japan, the
companies said Friday.
   Steel made on the continuous galvanizing line will supply
automotive markets in the United States and Canada. The
260,000-square-foot plant will be built by a joint venture of
National Steel, Dofasco Inc. of Canada and NKK Corp. of Japan.
   Dofasco will own 50 percent of the facility, NKK will own 40
percent and National Steel will own 10 percent.
   The 28-acre site is located in the Ojibway Industrial Park near
the Detroit River in the southwest area of the city, National Steel
said. Construction of the line will begin almost immediately and
should be completed in early 1993, it said.

<TEXT>
   The United Food and Commercial Workers
International Union on Friday urged consumers to boycott Giant and
Martins food stores until officials treat workers fairly.
   Union leaders said Giant and Martins, both owned by the
Netherlands-based company Ahold, want to force American workers to
pay part of their health care costs while benefits for foreign
employees are fully paid.
   ``Expecting workers in America to have a co-pay where there
wasn't one before is blatantly unfair,'' said Carl Huber, president
of Pittsburgh Local 23, which represents 23,000 workers.
   In Pennsylvania, 5,000 workers are employed at 52 Giant stores.
Only two stores, in Lewistown and Burnham, are unionized. Martins
employs 1,000 employees in a dozen stores in Maryland, West
Virginia and Virginia, according to union spokeswoman Denise Crowe.
   Huber said a strike at those two stores is likely sometime
Saturday night. Company officials did not return several phone
calls.

<HEAD>Bally Casino Unit Skips Payment; Gets Lower Bond Rating</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bally Manufacturing Corp. said Friday its casino
subsidiary would miss an $18.4 million mortgage interest payment
while the entire company undergoes a financial review and a shakeup
of top-level management.
   In New York, Moody's Investors Service lowered the debt ratings
of Bally and its subsidiaries from B2 to Caa, a designation for
bonds that are considered of ``poor standing.''
   Because Bally Grand Inc. will take advantage of a 30-day grace
period provided for its Oct. 15 scheduled interest payment, Moody's
also lowered its rating from Ba3 to Caa.
   The company, which is heavily in debt, has been plagued in
recent weeks by unfavorable financial rumors and even speculation
that Bally could seek shelter in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
   Bally's board of directors also decided to suspend payment of
dividends on its common stock and is moving toward restructuring
its finances, the Chicago-based gambling and fitness company said
in a statement.
   ``I have a significant investment in Bally, and I am pleased
that the board has decided to consider a restructuring plan,'' said
Arthur M. Goldberg, whom the company named interim chief executive
officer.
   ``I believe that we can develop an overall plan that is feasible
and in the best interests of the company, its stockholders and
creditors,'' he said.
   Goldberg, a New Jersey investor, replaces Robert E. Mullane, who
retired, the company said.
   Credited with turning several other companies toward
profitability after acquiring control, Goldberg had taken a 5.4
percent stake in Bally last month.
   A newly created office of the chairman will consist of Goldberg;
Roger N. Keesee, Bally president and chief operating officer;
Kenneth C. Nichols, a member of the board of directors; and Richard
Gillman, president and chief executive officer of Bally's Park
Place Inc. subsidiary. Gillman also was named to the board of
directors.
   Last year, New Jersey gaming officials had opposed the company's
plans to spin off to shareholders two casinos each in Nevada and
Atlantic City, N.J.
   Bally owns four casino hotels and a nationwide network of
fitness centers, while making gaming, fitness and lottery products.
   Its health clubs operate under the names Chicago Health Clubs,
Holiday Health, Jack LaLanne, Scandinavian and Vic Tanney.

<HEAD>Alcoa's Earnings Decrease 43 Percent in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alcoa said Friday its third-quarter profits
declined nearly 43 percent, reflecting decreasing orders and lower
aluminum prices.
   Other factors were lower earnings from the company's Brazilian
operations and a decrease in orders for some fabricated products,
said Alcoa spokesman Al T. Posti.
   For the three months ended Sept. 30, net income totaled $125.1
million, or $1.46 a share, compared with $219 million, or $2.46 a
share, in the corresponding period of 1989.
   Included in the latest quarterly earnings were unfavorable
translation and exchange adjustments of $10.9 million, or 13 cents
a share, Alcoa said.
   Quarterly sales fell nearly 4 percent to $2.7 billion from $2.8
billion in 1989.
   For the first nine months of the year, earnings fell 44 percent
to $435.6 million, or $5.01 a share, from $780.2 million, or $8.79
a share.
   Nine-month sales totaled $8 billion, compared with $8.2 billion
a year earlier.
   Earnings for the first nine months of the year reflect lower
average aluminum ingot prices and an $82 million reduction in the
earnings contributions from the company's Brazilian affiliate due
to government actions to improve that country's economy.
   Alcoa employs 61,000 people at 152 operating and sales locations
in 20 countries.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed, Silver Rebounds but Gold Slips</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar finished mixed Friday in a world
market traders said was influenced by a myriad of factors, from
uncertainty in federal budget negotiations to falling oil prices.
   Silver prices recovered slightly after sinking to levels not
seen in 14 years, but gold prices slid.
   In New York, one British pound fetched $1.9675, less expensive
than $1.9775 late Thursday. But in London, the pound rose to
$1.9740 from $1.9640 late Thursday.
   ``This is just a very volatile market,'' said Lloyd G. Atkinson,
chief economist with the Bank of Montreal. ``There's not much to
make out of trends. It's just a very, very nervous market.''
   Atkinson said foreign traders were shocked at developments in
Washington, where budget negotiators have been unable to reach an
agreement on a deficit reduction plan.
   ``I'm astounded in terms of the flip-flop that's going on on the
part of George Bush,'' Atkinson said, referring to the President's
shifting stance on raising taxes for the wealthy in exchange for a
cut in the capital gains tax.
   The dollar settled at 129.05 Japanese yen, down from 129.47 on
Thursday. In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.65 yen to a closing 129.30
yen. Later, in London, it fell to 128.65 yen.
   Other selected late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday rates included: 1.5243 German marks, up from 1.5138;
1.2860 Swiss francs, up from 1.2730; 5.1055 French francs, up from
5.0705; 1,142.25 Italian lire, up from 1,134.75; 1.1471 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1468.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday
included: 1.5175 German marks, down from 1.5330; 1.2780 Swiss
francs, down from 1.2910; 5.0855 French francs, down from 5.1292;
1.7110 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7280; 1,137.25 Italian lire,
down from 1,147.25; 1.1470 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1512.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery fell $2.20 to settle at $387.50 a troy ounce. Republic
National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $388.00,
down $3.00 from late Thursday.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $388.15 a troy ounce
from $389.75 bid per ounce late Thursday.
   In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of $388.00 from $389.60
late Thursday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.95 to close at a
bid $387.76.
   Silver bullion for current delivery rebounded to settle at
$4.306 a troy ounce, up from $4.235 Thursday.
   Silver also recovered somewhat in London to a late bid price of
$4.34 a troy ounce, up from $4.28 Thursday, when silver's price
fell more than 5 percent.

<HEAD>Super Collider's Funds Cut by Budget Conferees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Representatives of the House and the Senate
cut 23 percent from the superconducting super collider's 1991
budget Friday as part of Congress' deficit-reduction effort.
   The size of the cut stunned the atom smasher's supporters and
threatened its long-term survival.
   Members of the House and Senate appropriations committees cut
the collider's budget by $75 million to $243 million. The committee
freed $25 million that had been set aside for later use on the
collider, an action that reduced the effect of the cut to $50
million.
   The cut will delay the collider's completion, now scheduled for
1998, and raise its cost, proponents said. And both those factors
will harm its support in Congress.
   The collider, housed in a 54-mile underground ring to be built
south of Dallas, would be used by scientists to study subatomic
matter.
   Both the House and the Senate earlier approved spending $318
million on it in 1991. But that was done without an overall budget
outline.
   Congress on Monday approved an outline telling committees to
develop spending cuts and tax hikes to meet a deficit-reduction
target of $45 billion in 1991.
   The appropriations conferees had been asked to cut $750 million
from the 1991 appropriations bill for energy and water projects.
The atom smasher, still in the beginning stages of construction, is
10 percent of that savings.
   Randy Erben, director of the Texas Office of Federal-State
Relations, said state officials may consider making up the $50
million. But, he added, ``without the reimbursement guarantee, we'd
be essentially buying a pig in a poke.''

   The stock market pulled out of a steep
three-session slide with a rally Friday aided by a decline in oil
prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 32.92 points to
2,398.02, cutting its loss for the week to 112.62 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
917 up, 640 down and 432 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 187.49 million
shares, up from 180.06 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 224.66 million shares.
   Oil prices dropped amid conjecture that chances might be
improving for a break in the stalemate with Iraq in the Persian
Gulf.
   Specifically, analysts cited a report attributed to Iraq's
opposition party that President Saddam Hussein had been soliciting
opinions on the possibility of withdrawing from Kuwait.
   But brokers also said the economic and financial news offered
little evidence of lasting relief from the recession worries that
have plagued the market for several months.
   The Labor Department reported that the wholesale price index of
finished goods jumped 1.6 percent in September, propelled by
surging energy prices.
   Negative news had been widely anticipated from the index, which
provides a measure of inflationary pressures in the distribution
pipelines of the economy. Still, brokers said, the figure served as
a damper on whatever hopes existed for a relaxation of the Federal
Reserve's credit policy any time soon.
   Chemical Banking fell | to 12| on top of a 1}-point loss
Thursday, when the bank holding company reported a $43.7 million
loss for the third quarter and cut its quarterly dividend from 68

   A brewery built in 1983 by the Miller
Brewing Co. but which never opened because of sagging sales will be
producing beer by next July, the company said Friday.
   Preparation for producing canned beer at the $411 million
brewery near Trenton in southwest Ohio will begin in January, with
bottle and keg lines to follow, spokesman Richard Klemp said.
   Klemp said the brewery will be able to produce any kind of
Miller product and will be fitted with special equipment to produce
Miller Genuine Draft, which the company said is one of its
fastest-growing brands.
   State Rep. Michael Fox, R-Hamilton, said Miller has received
$11.5 million in tax reductions for the plant. He said it stands to
receive another $10.1 million in tax breaks under an agreement to
provide 1,500 jobs and a $30 million payroll by 1982.
   Political leaders, irked that Miller had not delivered the
promised jobs, had threatened to revoke the tax benefits unless the
plant opened.
   It will be Miller's seventh brewery, complementing others in
Milwaukee, Wis.; Fulton, N.Y.; Eden, N.C.; Albany, Ga.; Fort Worth,
Texas, and Irwindale, Calif.
   Miller shipped a record of nearly 42 million barrels of beer
last year. The 3.7 percent gain over 1988 was the company's largest
in three years.

<TEXT>
   It's sweaty-palm season in the American workplace.
   Squeezed by tough times, more than two dozen major U.S.
corporations this year are slashing payrolls by several hundred to
a few thousand workers each.
   Reflecting this upheaval, the U.S. unemployment rate worsened
for the third straight month in September, to 5.7 percent, the
first time since the 1981-82 recession that the jobless rate rose
three months in a row.
   Behind these figures looms an emerging human toll that could
have serious repercussions on American industry and the traditional
bond between employer and employee.
   As layoffs ripple through a range of businesses and geographic
regions, the newly unemployed are growing angry and frustrated.
People who still have jobs are worried about losing them.
   The situation is exacerbated by the fact that these layoffs -
unlike the blue-collar upheavals of previous recessions - are
hitting white-collar professionals and other groups that once
thought themselves immune to corporate cost-cutting.
   ``All of a sudden there's a whole class of young professionals
having their hopes dashed,'' said Ronald S. Ebert, a psychologist
at the Levinson Institute in Belmont, Mass.
   The list of giants announcing cuts in recent weeks read like a
who's who of corporate America: Chase Manhattan Corp., Pan Am
Corp., Digital Equipment Corp., Ford Motor Corp. and Saks Fifth
Avenue among others.
   The hardest hit regions so far have been the Northeast,
particularly New England, the South Atlantic region and the
Midwest.
   One senior level executive, who requested anonymity, was earning
``well in excess'' of $200,000 annually at a major Midwestern
packaged foods company when he learned he would be let go in
September, part of company-wide layoffs of nearly 1,000 workers.
   Morale in the ranks of many departments, including sales and
marketing, suddenly plummeted, he recalled.
   ``People are looking over their shoulder and waiting for the
other shoe to drop,'' he said. ``Frankly I think it is getting in
the way of the business. People are concerned about who's going to
be let go next and whether or not they will have a job the next day
or next month or next year,'' he said.
   Things are no better for the victims of the cuts, many of whom
have been left without jobs after long careers.
   ``You can see the hurt in a guy's eyes who's got himself an MBA,
got himself two kids who've gone to college, a house and wife up in
Connecticut, making $170,000 for last five years, all of a sudden
coming out with no place to go,'' said Mark Altman, president of
M-A Management Associates Inc., a New York City recruitment firm.
   Some dismissed professionals internalize the frustration and
suffer depression, counselors and psychologists say. A few, on the
other hand, may seek revenge.
   ``It's not often the employee sets out to do something terrible
to the employer,'' said Nella G. Barkley, president of
Crystal-Barkley Corp., a New York career consulting concern.
   But she said employees have a ``tremendous potential for
disrupting the relationship with corporate clients'' by purposely
messing up a company's product or by joining the competition after
dismissal.
   Of course, many companies remain gracious in the way they show
employees the door.
   Friday was the last day for the Procter &amp; Gamble Paper Products
Co. plant in Cheboygan, Mich., a small town on the shore of
Michigan's Lake Huron. All that was left for about 150 workers was
to pick up their final paychecks, but 130 others opted to be
transferred to other plants in Green Bay, Wis., and Cincinnati.
   P&amp;G also expanded its retirement package, giving benefits to
workers whose age and accumulated years of service added to 75 or
more.
   ``I'm used to getting up and having a job to go to and putting
my 40 hours a week in. Now it's not going to be there,'' said
departing P&amp;G electrical technician Tracy Heath, 42. ``But it's
deer season. I think we just have to keep a positive outlook.''

<HEAD>Oil Prices Retreat Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices slipped Friday to close below $40 a
barrel after declining even more sharply during the day on a rumor
that Iraq was considering retreating from Kuwait.
   That rumor, which spread through the market about midday, caused
oil futures prices to plunge by about $2 a barrel, said Simom
Trimble, an oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   But U.S. government officials later said there was no indication
Iraq was considering such a move, causing oil prices to return to
near their morning level, analysts said.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November-delivery price
of light sweet crude, the benchmark grade of oil, closed at $39.69
a barrel, down 73 cents. On Thursday, the same contract rose $1.73
to close at a record $40.42 a barrel.
   Later contract months were all down.
   However, prices of some refined oil products rose Friday. Home
heating oil for November delivery rose .51 cent on the Nymex to
close at $1.0536 a gallon. Unleaded regular gasoline for November
delivery rose 1.13 cents a gallon to close at 97.13 cents. Later
contract months for both products were mixed.
   Natural gas fell 1 cent per 1,000 cubic feetoon the Nymex to
close at $1.95.
   Oil prices opened higher Friday morning after climbing in Europe
on word that the speaker of the Egyptian parliament had been shot
to death by terrorists, Trimble said. That development heightened
fears of increased terrorism in the Mideast.
   However, other than the rumor about an Iraqi withdrawal, there
was little news to affect domestic oil trading the rest of the day,
Trimble said.
   Thomas Blakeslee, an analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc.
in Hoboken, N.J., said another factor pushing down oil prices may
be wariness by traders in keeping oil above the $40 level.
   ``You're seeing a lot of resistance buying above this level,''
he said. ``The producers are comfortable with the prices where they
are now, and refiners are a little hesitant to refine at these
levels.''
   But Trimble said he did not interpret the price retreat Friday
to indicate a change in the direction of oil prices, which have
been driven sharply higher since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.

   For all those Kremlin rockers screaming ``I want
my MTV!'', their wish has come true.
   Starting this weekend, that most American of youthful tube
treats - music television - will be beamed to 88 million Soviet
households on primetime tv.
   Thanks to a deal two years in the making that was inked by the
New York-based cable music video channel and the Soviet television
company Gostelradio, the hourlong weekly rock'n roll show will also
include several commercials from such U.S. advertisers as LA Gear
and Wrangler.
   ``It's sort of another nail in the coffin in the Cold War,''
said Tom Freston, chairman of MTV Networks. ``It's certainly a
snapshot of a subculture (viewers) have seen very little of.''
   In evidence that American rock music is a universal tongue, the
show and commercials are spoken entirely in English, with only
Russian-language subtitles to guide young rockers.
   MTV is the latest in a string of U.S. cultural icons welcomed by
the Soviets since they began liberalizing their economy in the late
1980s. Just in the past year, purveyors of Americanism ranging from
McDonald's to Pizza Hut to Time Warner movie theaters have set up
shop in the Soviet Union.
   The MTV programming, included in a popular youth-oriented Soviet
program called ``Glance,'' consists of two music video shows
produced by MTV Europe. The MTV Europe fare, which is already seen
in Eastern Europe, will be broadcast for a year on Soviet
television, according to the agreement.
   ``European Top 20 Countdown,'' one of the shows featured in the
music program, will be seen by viewers in 25 countries with the
addition of Soviet viewership, Freston said.
   The other show featured on the program, ``The Party Zone,''
comprises this weekend's debut program. The episode will feature
American rappers LL Cool J and Young MC.
   While the program conspicuously lacks any Soviet rock bands, MTV
officials say they expect to include some later.
   None of the show's advertisers are currently distributing their
products in the Soviet Union, although Wrangler and Benetton are
expected to begin shortly, Freston said.
   But advertising experts say the publicity surrounding a U.S.
advertiser's entry into Soviet television may lend products a cache
that could fuel sales in the United States.
   In addition, ``There's a lot of brand recognition among Soviet
consumers for goods they can't legally acquire and that in the near
future they may be able to legally acquire,'' said Thomas
Remington, an expert on Soviet life at Emory University in Atlanta.
   For its debut on the show, LA Gear is showing a 30-second spot
that stars Michael Jackson wearing the high-fashion sneakers. The
same LA-gear commercial that is shown in the U.S. and in other
countries, this music-only ad lacks any spoken dialogue so Soviet
views should have little trouble comprehending it, said Tom Keefer,
vice president of international marketing at the Los Angeles-based
LA Gear.
   For the right to air its programming, MTV will pay Gostelradio
an undisclosed amount of cash as well as two minutes' worth of
programming time that the Soviet television company can sell on its
own. MTV retains six minutes' worth of commercial time.
   In addition, MTV is currently looking into the possibility of
running its programming on a 24-hour basis on a 100,000-subscriber
cable television system in Leningrad, as well as on several smaller
cable systems.

<HEAD>Soviets Agree to Send Natural Gas to Poland in Return for Food</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland will send thousands of tons of food and
tobacco to the Soviet Union to help alleviate shortages there, in
exchange for natural gas Poland needs badly, officials said Friday.
   The huge barter deal was negotiated during a visit to Moscow by
Polish diplomats led by Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski.
Skubiszewski met Friday with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The agreement benefits both sides. Soviet consumers have been
enraged by a lack of cigarettes and meat and Polish officials have
been working anxiously to assure supplies of fuel for homes and
factories next year.
   The Polish-Soviet agreement reflected new links between Moscow
and its former East European allies as they grope to define their
economic and political relations.
   The deal will not completely solve either country's problems.
But it may avert hunger in some Soviet cities this winter and help
keep the Polish economy from stalling as it shifts from communism
toward private enterprise.
   Polish officials are still hoping to obtain firm contracts for
deliveries of Soviet oil.
   For decades, the Soviet Union provided a steady supply of both
oil and natural gas to Poland at subsidized prices. But this year,
Soviet crude oil shipments were cut by about 25 percent after labor
unrest reduced Soviet oil extraction.
   Also, the Soviets have announced they will put trade with their
former East bloc allies on a hard currency basis, charging much
higher prices for oil and natural gas starting Jan. 1.
   Dariusz Ledworowski, Poland's undersecretary of state for
foreign economic relations, said Friday the reduction in Soviet
fuel supplies and sudden rise in prices was ``a new shock for our
economy.''
   Under the agreement reached Friday, Ledworowski said, Poland
will deliver 10,000 tons of butter, 100,000 tons of sugar, 10,000
tons of milk powder, 10,000 tons of meat and 3 billion cigarettes
to the Soviet Union this year.
   He said the food and tobacco would have an international market
value of about $120 million.
   In return, the Soviets will provide 1.4 billion cubic meters of
natural gas in the first quarter of 1991. He said those deliveries,
combined with 5.2 billion cubic meters guaranteed by previous
contracts with the Soviet Union, would meet 70 percent of Poland's
annual needs for imported natural gas.
   Ledworowski said Poland has been unable to obtain similar
assurances for crude oil deliveries.
   ``In gas, we have a guarantee. In oil, up to now, we haven't any
guarantee,'' he said. ``They (the Soviets) are not in a position to
inform me what they will be doing with oil.''
   In the past, the Soviet Union has provided about 85 percent of
Poland's oil. To help make up the shortfall, Poland has agreed to
buy half a million tons of crude from Iran and has sharply raised
domestic gasoline prices, officials in Warsaw said Thursday.
   As Gorbachev has steered the Soviet Union toward a market-based
economy, the old central planning system has broken down.
   Consumers face high inflation, shortages of essential goods and
workers in key industries have threatened strikes.

<HEAD>UAL Unions Preparing For Contract Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three United Airlines unions, which had been
involved in the unsuccessful employee buyout attempt of parent
company UAL Inc., announced Friday they would meet to prepare for
contract talks.
   The Association of Flight Attendants, the Air Line Pilots
Association and the International Association of Machinists said
they will meet Wednesday.
   Each of the unions' contracts has expired, but members have been
working under the provisions of the previous pacts, union officials
said.
   The flight attendants' contract expired Nov. 1, 1987; the
pilots' ran out April 1, 1988; and the machinists' ended Nov. 1,
1989.
   The unions have been negotiating on and off since then with
management, said Bobbie Pilkington, a spokeswoman for the flight
attendants union.
   The buyout attempt, which intensified early this year, also
slowed talks, she said.
   A bid for full employee ownership was rejected Tuesday by UAL's
board, marking the fourth failed takeover attempt of the carrier in
3{ years.
   The employee group was unable to arrange financing by Tuesday's
deadline for the $201-a-share, $4.38 billion offer the UAL board
had accepted in principle in April.
   The company said then that it wanted quick settlements of the
contracts with the pilots, machinists and flight attendants.
   No date has been set for union talks to resume, Pilkington said
Friday.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Soar on Report Iraq Mulling Kuwait Withdrawal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The main U.S. Treasury bond soared nearly $11
Friday on a report that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was
considering withdrawing from Kuwait.
   A pullout by Iraq from neighboring Kuwait almost certainly would
push down skyrocketing oil prices, lowering inflation and improving
the chances of lower interest rates - all of which would help
bonds.
   The government's benchmark 30-year bond gained 1 3-32 point, or
$10.94 per $1,000 in face amount, regaining all of a $9 drop
Thursday. Its yield, which falls when prices rise, sank to 8.95
percent from 9.06 percent late Thursday.
   Analysts said government reports showing a weak economy in the
wake of rampant inflating pegged to the Middle East crisis were
somewhat better than anticipated and did not have a major impact on
bonds.
   The Labor Department reported that wholesale prices shot up a
steep 1.6 percent in September, an annual rate of more than 20
percent. But analysts said that excluding food and energy, prices
were up 0.3 percent, about half of what was forecast.
   Also, the Commerce Department said retail sales were up 1.1
percent last month, a better performance than anticipated.
   Moving the market, though, was a statement by a group of Iraqi
exiles that Saddam is considering withdrawing from the emirate it
occupied Aug. 2. The claim by the Kurdistan Democratic Party-Iraq
was not independently confirmed. ``It's quite possible that oil
prices could immediately fall $10 or more a barrel'' if Iraq
withdraws from Kuwait,'' said Scott Winningham, a market analyst
with Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J.
   ``If that were to happen it obviously would have positive
implications for the inflationary outlook and consequently interest
rates,'' he said.
   The Federal Reserve has been under pressure to lower interest
rates to spur the struggling economy. Lower interest rates
typically translates to higher prices for fixed-income securities
such as bonds.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments rose 5-32 point to 5-16 point, intermediate maturities
rose 11-32 point to 19-32 point and long-term issues were up 15-16
point to 1 3-32 point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial
information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 5.40 to 1,146.76.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 7.36
percent as the discount rose 1 basis point to 7.14 percent. Yields
on six-month bills dropped to 7.50 percent as the discount rate
lost 1 basis point to 7.14 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell
to 7.56 percent as the discount dropped 3 basis points to 7.08
percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 7~ percent, unchanged from
late Thursday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds closed at 87 15-16, up 9-32 point. The
average yield to maturity fell to 7.84 percent from 7.87 percent
late Thursday.

   U.S. District Judge A. David Mazzone ordered
Eastman Kodak Co. to pay Polaroid Corp. $909.5 million in damages
and interest for infrining on seven Polaroid patents.
   In his decision Friday, the judge said Kodak's infringement was
not willful and declined to award the $12 billion Polaroid had
sought in punitive damages.
   Kodak officials said the award would be paid out of its earnings
without any substantial impact on the company's finances. Polaroid
said it would review the decision before determining its next step
in the 4-year-old suit.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S. Labor Department reported wholesale
prices soared 1.6 percent in September - an annual rate of more
than 20 percent - as gasoline prices shot up at their fastest pace
on record.
   While the Labor Department on Friday blamed much of the steep
increase in wholesale costs on costlier petroleum, prices excluding
the volatile energy and food areas were still up a worrisome 0.6
percent - twice the August gain.
   The 20.6 percent rise in the cost of gasoline was the highest
one-month increase since the government began tracking the
commodity in 1947.
   ---
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Rebounding automobile purchases and surging
gasoline prices powered retail sales to a strong 1.1 percent gain
in September, the government said.
   The figures released Friday showed the biggest advance in four
months, but economists said the two special factors were masking an
otherwise weak report, which included a large decline in department
store sales.

   HOT SPRINGS, Va. (AP) - Top business leaders have predicted the
U.S. economy will stagnate during the second half of this year. A
minority say a recession is here or on the way.
   The Business Council's fall forecast projected a nearly
imperceptible 0.3 percent economic growth rate in the second half
of 1990, and said oil-driven inflation will climb to 6.1 percent
before falling back below current levels.
   The forecast was presented Friday to the 100 leaders of the
nation's top corporations at their semiannual, two-day meeting at
this mountain resort.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of The Wall Street
Journal, is freezing capital spending and salaries and imposing
other news and business cutbacks to cope with weak financial
results and the sluggish economy.
   The cuts, announced in an internal memo to managers Thursday,
followed weeks of rumors about a possible retrenchment and
triggered concern over possible future layoffs at the media and
financial industry giant.

   The company said two other employees in the accounting staff

   Chief Financial Officer C. Steven Bolen, 44, was dismissed
following a board investigation that concluded he ``received
compensation payments that were not properly authorized and . . .
that certain bank accounts administered under (his) direction were

   BEIJING (AP) - In one of its few economic reforms this year,
China has opened a national wheat market to replace central
allocation of the nation's 85 million ton annual wheat harvest.
   More than 200 grain trading companies were to begin dealing on
opening day Friday at the Wholesale Grain Market in Zhengzhou, the
provincial capital of Henan, China's wheat heartland, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported.
   The market is one of China's few experiments in using markets to

<HEAD>Northwest Airline's Largest Union Says No to Wage Cut Proposal</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Stands for ST. PAUL-dated item on AM-Business News Digest</NOTE>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the largest union at
Northwest Airlines told the carrier's top executive Friday that
wage cuts are not an option in solving a cash crunch created by
soaring fuel costs.
   ``All we have said to this point is that we're not interested in
reducing the standard of living of our members by reducing our
wages,'' Guy Cook, president of the International Association of
Machinists District Lodge 143, said. ``We're willing to work with
management in almost any other form to try to find solutions to the
problem.''
   Cook said Northwest Chairman Alfred Checchi has asked the
machinists' union to choose between laying off between 10 percent
to 20 percent of workers or taking a 10 percent pay cut for six
months with no job losses.
   ``I called Mr. Checchi early this afternoon over the issue of
wage cuts to inform him that has to be eliminated from the possible
solutions,'' Cook said Friday. ``If layoffs have to be, then
management will have to make that decision.
   ``But I think offering a leave of absence to more senior people
would go a long way to alleviate some of that,'' Cook added.
   Northwest is not commenting on the details of Checchi's strategy
to reduce costs. Kevin Whalen, a spokesman, wouldn't even confirm
Friday whether Checchi is seeking concessions from labor groups.
   ``It's pretty sensitive and I can't get into any comments,''
Whalen said. ``Its been no secret. We need to look at how we can
cut expenses.''
   Cook said he delivered his message to Checchi Friday after
consulting with union members. There was no proposal for the
rank-and-file to vote on, Cook said.
   He said union members have expressed a willingness to increase
productivity and improve cost efficiency as a way to combat the 65
percent increase in fuel costs.
   Northwest is the nation's fourth largest airline, headquartered
in the Minneapolis suburb of Eagan. It employs about 44,000
workers, including about 16,500 in Minnesota. If Northwest trimmed
15 percent of its total work force, such a cut would equal 6,600
jobs.
   Members of the machinists' union include mechanics, baggage
handlers, reservations agents and other ground personnel. A 15
percent layoff would affect about 3,300 union members.
   Other big airlines such as USAir, Pan American World Airways and
American Airlines have already begun laying off thousands of
workers in an effort to combat a 65 percent increase in fuel
prices. The fuel price run-up, sparked by Middle East turmoil,
could add $800 million to $1 billion a year to Northwest's tab for
fuel.
   Duane Woerth, chairman of the 5,600-member Northwest Air Line
Pilots Association union, told the Saint Paul Pioneer Press
Thursday he planned to meet with Checchi Friday. Woerth could not
be reached Friday for comment and Whalen would not comment on
whether a meeting occurred.
   Woerth said Thursday that, under contract agreements with
Northwest, the carrier cannot lay off any pilots until
mid-February. That provision has been triggered by the airline's
participation in government programs to allow Northwest pilots and
jets to shuttle U.S. troops to the Middle East.
   Under its agreement with pilots, he said, the airline also is
restricted to laying off only pilots hired since Aug. 28, 1989.
That means only new hires - who have been brought in at the lowest
pay - could be laid off. Union figures suggest only 273 pilots
would be vulnerable to layoff after mid-February.
   ``If the goal is to prevent layoffs, that's something we can
help construct,'' Woerth said, suggesting that vacation schedules
could be juggled to help avert layoffs.

<HEAD>Silver Futures Rebound from New 14-Year Low</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS grafs 2 and 4 to show gold prices fell</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Silver prices rose Friday after hitting a new 14-year low that
some analysts said might have marked the bottom of a dramatic
slide.
   On other commodity markets, gold fell; orange juice collapsed;
petroleum futures were mixed; grains and soybeans retreated; and
livestock and meat futures advanced.
   Silver settled 7 cents to 7.1 cents higher on New York's
Commodity Exchange with the contract for spot delivery up 7.1 cents
at $4.306 a troy ounce.
   Gold ended $2.20 to $2.30 lower with spot October at $387.50 a
troy ounce.
   Spot silver opened at $4.20 on the Commodity Exchange after
tumbling as low as $4.05 overnight on overseas markets. The
overnight price represented the metal's lowest price since late
1976, when silver hit $3.80, according to the Commodity Exchange.
   The fact that prices rebounded after nearing the psychologically
important $4 level may indicate the market is seeking or has found
a bottom, analysts said.
   Don Tierney, metals analyst with Fortune Commodities Inc. in New
York, said it costs $4 to $4.50 an ounce to mine domestic silver.
   ``With the market holding above that magic $4 number, it will
look attractive to traders looking for a new, cheap position,'' he
said.
   Bruno Zbinden, chief of precious metal trading for Swiss Bank
Corp., said he would not rule out a price dip below $4 an ounce,
``but this is a level where investors should be able to buy silver
and do nicely over the long term.''
   Silver's plunge from about $4.70 an ounce began Tuesday,
triggered by mounting fears that a recession would curtail
industrial demand for the metal.
   Some analysts said Friday's gain of almost 33 points in the Dow
Jones industrial average may have helped ease recession worries.
   Orange juice futures crashed on the New York Cotton Exchange
after the Agriculture Department on Thursday released a Florida
orange harvest projection that was far above expectations.
   The near-term contract, for delivery in November, opened down
the permitted daily limit of 10 cents a pound, forcing a trading
halt. Trading resumed with an expanded limit of 20 cents in the
November contract.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice for November delivery settled
down 16.45 cents at $1.1345 a pound. All other delivery months fell
their permitted limit of 5 cents.
   The USDA estimated a Florida orange harvest of 165 million
90-pound boxes and a yield of 1.52 gallons per box compared with
last year's frost-reduced harvest of 110.2 million boxes and yield
of 1.23 gallons per box.
   Crude oil futures fell in choppy trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange after an Iraqi opposition group said Iraq is
considering withdrawing from Kuwait and that its ruling political
party has circulated a questionnaire asking key members for their
opinion.
   Light sweet crude oil ended 8 cents to 73 cents lower with
November at $39.69 a barrel; heating oil was .56 cent lower to .51
cent higher with November at $1.0536 a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .90 cent lower to 1.13 cents higher with November at 97.13
cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures prices ended mostly lower on the
Chicago Board of Trade as selling pressure from the wheat market
eroded the supportive influence of Thursdy's bullish corn and
soybean crop report.
   Wheat futures settled 4 cents to 6 cents lower with December at
$2.66{ a bushel; corn was 2{ cents lower to { cent higher with
December at $2.30\ a bushel; oats were \ cent to 1 cent lower with
December at $1.19\ a bushel; soybeans were { cent lower to 4 cents
higher with November at $6.20{ a bushel.
   Most pork belly futures jumped the permitted daily limit of 2
cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, leading livestock
futures higher.
   Supplies of frozen pork bellies are nearly depleted, providing
support to the market, analysts said. Firmer cash markets boosted
cattle and hog futures.
   Live cattle settled .02 cent to .48 cent higher with October at
79 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .48 cent higher
with October at 87.62 cents a pound; live hogs were .40 cent to
1.10 cents higher with October at 57.62 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.87 cents to 2 cents higher with February at 66.40
cents a pound.

<HEAD>Kodak Ordered To Pay Polaroid $900 Million for Patent Infringement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCIS HOPKINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Friday ordered Eastman Kodak Co.
to pay to Polaroid Corp. $909.5 million for infringing on instant
camera patents, ending a 14-year legal battle with what is believed
to be the largest such award in history.
   But in his ruling, U.S. District Judge A. David Mazznne said
Kodak did not willfully infringe on Polaroid patents for instant
camera and film when it entered the business in 1976.
   Despite the record size, the award was far less than the $12
billion Polaroid sought in its damages lawsuit against Kodak and
the $1 billion to $2 billion predicted by analysts.
   Kodak had said it should pay $177 million, equal to 5 percent
royalties on the instant cameras and film Kodak sold from 1976
until 1985.
   U.S. District Judge Rya Zobel in Boston in 1985 ruled that Kodak
had infringed on seven of about 150 Polaroid patents on instant
cameras and film. She barred the Rochester, N.Y.-based company from
the business in January 1986. Kodak Chairman Kay R. Whitmore said
in a statement the award would be paid from profits and would have
``no material financial impact'' on the company. He said Kodak was
pleased Mazzone ruled the infringement was not willful.
   ``It has always been our firm policy to respect the valid patent
rights of others and the avoidance of any patent infringement was
uppermost in our minds in the design of our instant cameras and
films,'' Whitmore said.
   I. MacAllister Booth, president of Cambridge-based Polaroid,
said in a statement that Polaroid was reviewing the decision
``considering the significance of the injury to the company and its
shareholders.''
   The statement did not rule out the possibility that Polaroid
would appeal the damages award and a company spokeswoman declined
to comment.
   Booth's statement said Polaroid's board would review how to use
the damages money ``but will not announce how we plan to apply the
proceeds when received until there is a final resolution of this
litigation.''
   Instant photography was invented by Polaroid founder Edwin H.
Land in 1947 and first marketed in 1948. Polaroid held a monopoly
for almost 30 years until Kodak entered the field in 1976.
   Polaroid argued that Kodak's competition cut into profits and
forced Polaroid to sell some cameras below cost.
   The two companies had a good relationship for decades, with
Kodak making film for Polaroid, but things soured in when Polaroid
introduced the SX-70 color instant camera in 1972.
   When Polaroid tried to work out a deal for Kodak to provide film
for its new camera, Kodak officials said they would do it if
Polaroid gave them license to create its own instant photography.
Polaroid refused and built its own film manufacturing facilities.
   The damages award was disclosed after the stock markets closed.
Kodak shares fell $2.75 to close at $35.25 in consolidated New York
Stock Exchange trading, while Polaroid shares lost 12{ cents to
close at $29.37{.
   David S. Nelson, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
in New York, said the award amounts to a nearly $20 per share boost
Polaroid stock before taxes. ``The difference is a major factor for
the value of Polaroid's common stock,'' he said.
   But Nelson added that ``some people will be disappointed that
the damages with interest are less than $1 billion.''
   A $207 million damages award against Smith International Inc. to
Hughes Tool Co. in 1986 for copying drill bit technology is
believed the previous record patent infringement award.
   Analysts have predicted that a sizeable award would allow
Polaroid to diversify into fields such as information retrieval or
conventional photography.
   Kodak already has paid more than $100 million in cash to about
3.4 million owners of its instant camera to settle a class-action
lawsuit seeking cash as part of the company's settlement with
people who bought the banned cameras.
   Kodak gave each camera owner a cash refund of $19 to $52, plus
rebate coupons worth $18 to $30 for use on Kodak products.

<HEAD>Pillsbury Settles Racial Discrimination Suit For $3.6 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Friday gave preliminary
approval to a $3.6 million settlement of a race discrimination
lawsuit against Pillsbury Inc.
   The suit was filed in May 1989 and focused almost entirely on
alleged discriminatory practices against black employees and job
applicants from 1984 to 1988, before the acquisition of the
Minneapolis-based food company by Grand Metropolitan PLC in January
1989.
   The settlement involves no finding by the court nor admission by
Pillsbury or Grand Met of wrongdoing. The parties agreed to it to
avoid further lengthy litigation, said attorneys for the
plaintiffs.
   ``The settlement affects certain black persons who are presently
or were formerly employed by Pillsbury in salaried jobs anywhere in
the United States, as well as black persons who were applicants or
were deterred from applying for salaried employment with Pillsbury
in Minnesota,'' U.S. District Judge David Doty wrote in a notice of
settlement.
   Members of the settlement class could include blacks who were
fired before May 8, 1989, blacks who applied for a job but were not
hired and blacks who considered applying but did not apply,
according to the notice of settlement.
   Charles V. Wilson, a Grand Met spokesman, said the settlement
``will enable us to accelerate the momentum which has been building
in our cultural diversity efforts since the Grand Met acquisition.
The programs that will be funded by this settlement over the next
few years will improve opportunities for all employees.''
   Paul Sprenger, lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said he was
``pleased with the settlement. But I am even more pleased by the
willingness of Grand Met and Pillsbury to step forward from the
moment the case was filed to resolve these important issues in a
way that maximizes the long-term benefits to everyone involved.''
   According to the settlement, detailed in a consent decree filed
in federal court in Minneapolis, Pillsbury will allocate over four
years $3.6 million, including attorneys' fees and expenses, to or
for the benefit of the settlement class.
   The funds will be used to settle the claims of the 14 named
plaintiffs and to pay awards to eligible former employees fired
between 1984 and 1989. The funds will also support the cultural
diversity department at Pillsbury.
   In addition, the settlement will create funds to pay training
and education expenses and dependent tuition scholarships, as well
as to support career development for eligible current employees.

<HEAD>Building Company Seeks Chapter 11 Protection Because of Asbestos
Suits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Celotex Corp., citing a crush of
asbestos-related lawsuits, announced Friday it has filed for
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy laws.
   Kenneth Hyatt, the company's chairman, president and chief
executive, said the filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Tampa will
allow it to resolve the lawsuits while continuing in the
manufacture and sale of building products.
   ``The decision to file Chapter 11 was forced solely by an
inability to continue to obtain insurance proceeds to fund the
enormous costs associated with the massive asbestos-related
litigation,'' said Hyatt, stressing that the company will continue
its operations fully.
   Like other companies that once made asbestos, Celotex and
wholly-owned subsidiary Carey Canada Inc. have been fighting
litigation surrounding the cancer-causing insulation material since
the early 1970s.
   By the end of last month, there were more than 140,000 personal
injury lawsuits pending against the companies in state and federal
courts around the country.
   Settlement and defense costs for such suits have exceeded $587
million, the company estimated, most of it paid through its
insurance coverage.
   But Celotex said several insurance carriers have disputed
coverage, leading to more litigation to recover under the policies.
   Celotex said in a statement that, through bankruptcy protection,
it hopes to be able to resolve its remaining coverage disputes and
develop a plan which will permit fair payment of its
asbestos-related liabilities.
   Asbestos-related cases form the largest number of personal
injury lawsuits nationwide. Several dozen companies that
manufactured asbestos are defendants.
   The biggest defendant is the Manville trust, a fund to pay
claims established as part of the reorganization of the Manville
Corp., once the nation's largest producer of asbestos.
