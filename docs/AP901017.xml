   Wilbert Lee Evans, who said he deserved
another chance for helping prison workers during a death-row
escape, was executed Wednesday night in Virginia's electric chair
for the 1981 murder of a sheriff's deputy.
   Evans, 44, was put to death 3{ hours after the U.S. Supreme
Court denied a stay of execution. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder also
refused a request for clemency as Evans awaited his execution at
the State Penitentiary.
   Evans was led into the death chamber in the prison's basement,
strapped into the electric chair and administered two 55-second
surges of 2,500 volts each, said Wayne Farrar, spokesman for the
state Department of Corrections.
   He was pronounced dead at 11:09 p.m.
   Bart Stapert, assistant director of the Virginia Coalition of
Jails and Prisons, said he met with Evans and the inmate told him:
``I want to say to the family of Mr. Truesdale I'm dead. You don't
have to hate me any more.''
   Evans was sentenced to die for shooting Alexandria Deputy
Sheriff William Truesdale on Jan. 27, 1981. Truesdale was returning
Evans to the Alexandria jail after a hearing when Evans grabbed the
deputy's gun and shot him.
   The Supreme Court issued its ruling at 7:30 p.m. Justice
Thurgood Marshall, who opposes capital punishment in all cases, was
the lone dissenter in the 8-1 vote.
   Evans' attorneys based final efforts to save him on his actions
during the May 1984 breakout of six death row inmates at the
Mecklenburg Correctional Center. The lawyers contended that Evans,
who did not join the escapees, intervened to save prison guards and
nurses from harm.
   In his dissent, Marshall said: ``A system of capital punishment
that would permit Wilbert Evans' execution, notwithstanding
as-to-now unrefuted evidence showing that death is an improper
sentence, is a system that cannot stand.''
   It was the 141st execution in the United States since the
Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, and the 10th in
Virginia.
   In a letter hand-delivered to the governor's office Wednesday
afternoon, Evans' attorneys presented evidence from an internal
State Police and Corrections Department report on the escape.
   ``Only you, Governor, can prevent the commonwealth from foisting
upon Wilbert Evans tonight an unconstitutionally cruel and unusual
punishment,'' said the letter signed by attorney Arthur F. Mathews.
   The letter included excerpts of statements from prison guards
and nurses that Evans protected them during the escape. One nurse
said Evans stopped inmates Earl Clanton and Linwood Briley from
molesting her.
   Of the escapees, Clanton, Briley and his brother, James Briley,
have been executed. The other three remain on death row.
   Evans said Wednesday in a telephone interview from the
penitentiary that he was keeping busy ``doing legal work,'' writing
his will and conferring by telephone with his attorneys.
   ``You've got to keep your hope up,'' he said.
   Evans described his feelings as a mixture of hope and caution,
clamminess and nervousness.
   Last Saturday, U.S. District Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr. granted
Evans a stay. Merhige concluded the trial jury's finding of future
dangerousness as a reason for imposing the death sentence was
thrown into question by Evans' actions during the Mecklenburg
incident.
   A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
overturned the stay Tuesday. The appeals panel accepted the state's
argument that Evans was seeking clemency, a matter for the
governor, not a question for the courts.

<TEXT>
   The investment banker who helped rescue New York
City from the brink of bankruptcy in the 1970s said Wednesday that
the city faces a worse financial crisis now.
   Felix Rohatyn, 62, said he would step down as chairman of the
Municipal Assistance Corp. by the end of the year to spend more
time with his wife, Elizabeth, who is recovering from recent
surgery.
   The assistance corporation was created in June 1975 to assist
the city financially by using sales tax revenues to back bonds
issued by the city. New York was near bankruptcy at the time and
Rohatyn was one of the architects of its recovery.
   Rohatyn, also a member of the city's Council of Economic
Advisers, criticized union leaders demanding ``unrealistic'' pay
hikes from the city.
   Rohatyn suggested that pension money now earmarked for a
teachers' pay raise instead go into city coffers.
   Rohatyn, who has no direct say in the contract negotiations,
said the state's fiscal problems and ``a much more serious'' city
budget crisis prompted him to speak out at the oversight group's
meeting Wednesday.
   The problems are financial, economic and social and are of
proportions that ``I haven't seen in 40 years,'' said Rohatyn.
   On Oct. 1, the city gave the United Federation of Teachers a 5.5
percent pay increase in a one-year contract. The increase was
predicated on rearranging the city's pension contribution to the
teachers retirement fund and making a more optimistic forecast of
the dividends earned.
   Rohatyn said that if the rearranged city contribution results in
extra money, it should go to help New York.
   ``Credible fiscal balance is necessary for full and free access
to the credit markets. Social balance dictates the fewest number of
layoffs possible,'' he said in a letter to City Council Speaker
Peter Vallone and the Financial Control Board.
   ``Both objectives will be served by dedicating whatever pension
savings are deemed prudent to ... the framework of an overall
comprehensive city financial plan.''
   UFT President Sandra Feldman said Rohatyn ``is really meddling
with things that are not really his affair.''
   Mayor David Dinkins said later Wednesday that if the state
Legislature fails to pprove changes in pension earnings
assumptions to finance half of the raise, the city would not be
liable for the difference.
   Rohatyn said similar demands from other unions are ``pushing the
city closer and closer to a real crisis.''
   However, Barry Feinstein, president of Teamsters Local 237,
which represents 12,000 city workers, said pension assumptions were
raised four times during Mayor Ed Koch's administration, the last
time to balance the budget. Dinkins succeeded Koch in January.
   Among the problems cited by Rohatyn are a $1.8 billion budget
gap already plugged for fiscal 1991 and a predicted shortfall of at
least $2 billion through fiscal 1992.
   Standard &amp; Poors Corp. last week placed the city on its ``credit
watch'' list, meaning the bond rating agency is reviewing the
city's ability to pay interest and principal on $13 billion in
general obligation bonds. It did not change its bond rating for the
city.
   There are potential layoffs of city workers and city agencies
are preparing to cut $1 billion over the next 21 months.
   Officials predict a statewide budget deficit of up to $3 billion
in the fiscal year starting April 1, 1991.

   The star of a Cambodian dance troupe decided to
remain in the United States Wednesday when the rest of the company
went home, her lawyer said.
   Yim Devi was the fifth dancer in the 32-member Cambodian
Classical Dance Company to defect during its national tour, the
first U.S.-Cambodian artistic exchange since 1971.
   Devi's attorney, Martin Garbus, refused to describe Devi's act
as a defection, saying her passport is valid until December.
   ``She's going to explore her options,'' he said. ``She might
stay two days, she might stay a week. Who knows? She may want to
pursue her studies here.''
   Devi was among several troupe members who reported receiving
death threats during their tour. Tour organizers alleged that a
network of Cambodian-Americans was pressing the dancers to defect.

<HEAD>Top Banking Regulator Accepts Contributions From Failed S&amp;L
Executives</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida's top banking regulator
accepted campaign contributions from directors of 40 percent of the
financial institutions that have failed in the state since 1985, a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
   Since 1985, 39 financial institutions supervised by Comptroller
Gerald Lewis, the only elected state banking regulator in the
country, have failed.
   The directors of 16 contributed to Lewis' re-election campaigns
beginning in 1982, The Miami Herald reported. From 1982 through
this year, Lewis received more than $25,000 from those directors,
it said.
   In at least five cases, Lewis received contributions from
businessmen who later received permission to open state-chartered
institutions, the newspaper said.
   Among his backers were the directors of two of the states
largest S&amp;Ls, CenTrust in Miami and First American Bank and Trust
in North Palm Beach, both of which failed this year.
   Republican Chris Comstock, who is vying for Lewis' post, said
the Democratic incumbent ``has compromised himself by taking of
huge amounts of money from the people he regulates.''
   Lewis, the state's chief financial officer since 1974, said he
could not recall specific details of campaign contributions made
eight years ago. He said no contribution ever influenced his
decisions.
   His office could not prevent the bank failures, Lewis said.
   ``If we closed down those institutions, it shows we did act,''
Lewis said. ``The fact is that we have taken aggressive actions
against institutions that failed.''
   The S&amp;L crisis is expected to cost taxpayers billions of dollars
nationwide. Florida has one of the highest S&amp;L failure rates in the
country.
   In September 1982, Fort Lauderdale businessman Scott Gettemy
gave $3,000 to Lewis' campaign, the maximum allowed by state law.
In 1984, the Intercapital Savings Bank was incorporated with
Gettemy as a director, according to state records. It failed two
years later.
   Miami businessmen Said Haddad, Juan Martinez, Raul Sanchez, M.A.
Schofman and Cayetano Midolo gave thousands of dollars for Lewis'
1982 re-election. Less than two years later, they opened the Trust
Bank, which failed in 1988.
   The newspaper cited three other similar cases.
   Comstock, a financial adviser in St. Petersburg who worked as a
bank examiner for the New York State Department of Banking before
moving to Florida in 1982, said the donations created conflicts of
interest.
   ``It tends to prevent him from acting promptly when the
situation warrants,'' Comstock said. ``I don't think he's done a
good job regulating banks.''

   A judge who imposed a gag order on
coverage of a murder trial, then ordered reporters not to report
the gag order, has changed his mind.
   The Daily Press of Newport News, ignoring a prohibition by
Circuit Judge Morris B. Gutterman, reported both his gag order and
the order against reporting that he imposed it. The newspaper also
appealed the order, joined by the Richmond Times-Dispatch, The
Richmond News Leader and The Virginian-Pilot and The Ledger-Star of
Norfolk.
   Gutterman lifted his orders after the newspapers' attorneys met
with him in his chambers Tuesday.
   ``The action seems beyond belief to me,'' said Rod Smolla, a law
professor at the College of William and Mary's Marshall-Wythe
School of Law and director of the Institute of the Bill of Rights
Law.
   ``It seems to me ... that it is unconstitutional for a judge to
issue a gag order on the press in a criminal trial. Then to issue a
second gag order to keep the first secret only compounds the
problem,'' he said.
   Smolla said he'd never heard of a judge issued a gag order over
his own gag order.
   Gutterman declined to comment on the case.
   David C. Kohler, an attorney representing Richmond Newspapers
Inc., said Gutterman was concerned about what the jury in the
murder trial of Herbert G. Fisher might see in the newspapers.
Fisher is accused of killing his wife.
   When the trial opened Monday and the jury was out of the
courtroom, Gutterman ordered reporters not to make public any
courtroom activity that the jury did not see.
   Juries often are taken from the courtroom while attorneys argue
points of law, such as what evidence the jury should hear.
   Gutterman also ordered reporters not to publish any account of
his order.
   ``We thought it was clearly unconstitutional prior restraint,''
said Jack Davis, editor of the Daily Press. ``And we didn't think
we needed to abide by it.''
   Kohler said the U.S. Supreme Court has set out strict rules
concerning gag orders. In a 1973 ruling on a Nebraska murder trial,
the high court set out three criteria before judges can restrict
coverage of criminal trials: a compelling reason for such an order,
no alternative and effectiveness.

   Rep. Susan Molinari would like to become
so-ooo powerful that she could change women's fashion.
   No more high heels or pantyhose. Ever.
   ``When people make jokes about God being a woman, I say, `I
don't think so, because then we wouldn't have the babies or
stockings,''' she said. ``That was something a man did.''
   She rolls down the top of one black suede boot to prove she's a
fashion rebel. ``I wear boots all the time so I can wear knee
socks.''
   Molinari has a way to go before Fashion Avenue takes its cue
from her. But the New York Republican is becoming better-known
around Capitol Hill, where she's been since winning a special
election in March.
   Last month, just six months into her term, Molinari won her
first big fight in Congress, defeating an amendment proposed by
21-term Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla.
   Bennett, a powerful member of the House Armed Services
Committee, proposed closing the Navy home port on Staten Island,
N.Y. - the heart of Molinari's district. The home port, which is
about 90 percent complete, is opposed by New York Mayor David
Dinkins and every member of the New York City congressional
delegation except Molinari and Rep. Tom Manton, a Queens Democrat.
   Closing the home port would be cheaper than opening it, Bennett
argued.
   But Molinari, who at 32 is the youngest member of Congress,
stood boldly on the House floor and hit her fellow congressmen
where they live.
   ``Your base could be next,'' she warned ominously.
   The House voted 230 to 188 in favor of Molinari's substitute
amendment to save the base. She was ecstatic.
   That evening, Guy Molinari offered a champagne toast to his
daughter's big feet, an admission that they were finally large
enough to fill his shoes.
   Susan Molinari, an only child, succeeded her father to Congress.
She is only the second daughter in history to do so. (Winnifred
Mason Huck, R-Ill., followed her father, William Mason Huck,
R-Ill., when he died in 1921.)
   After five terms in Congress, Guy Molinari retired last year to
run, successfully, for Staten Island borough president.
   To try for the House, Susan Molinari gave up a seat on the New
York City Council that she had won in 1985. As the lone Republican
in the 35-member body, she was minority leader from Day One and
received such perks as a city car, extra staff and an office in
City Hall.
   But, she said during a recent interview, ``There was a certain
level of frustration in being a member of the New York City
Council.''
   For example, she could never become chairwoman of a committee,
and getting bills passed could be tough.
   Plus, she said, ``some of the most important problems that are
confronting my district are environmental problems, and those have
to be handled on the federal level because of our proximity to New
Jersey.''
   Staten Island is downwind of New Jersey's huge petrochemical
industry and Molinari believes that's why her constituents have
such a high rate of respiratory ailments.
   So while she's now one of 435 and still in the minority to boot,
Molinari feels it's a lot easier to get things done in Congress
than she had anticipated.
   ``I expected the place to be more arcane in terms of
participation in committees and ability to get legislation passed,
to speak on the floor,'' she said. ``In fact, I find it's a pretty
open institution. I find it less political than I ever expected it
to be.''
   Of course, Molinari came to Washington with many advantages her
fellow freshmen lack.
   ``I have always received a lot of benefits both politically and
personally having Guy Molinari as my father,'' she admitted.
``However, having a record of 6{ years in the City Council, people
did have something to judge.''
   The fact that her father was New York state chairman of George
Bush's election committee in 1988 didn't hurt, either. Bush
appeared at a fund-raiser for Susan Molinari in February, partly to
repay the debt to her father. The event pulled in about $150,000.
   Susan Molinari said she hopes to continue some of the work her
father started in Congress - and especially to see the home port
open and running. But she said she disagrees with her father on
some key issues, particularly those that define differences in
gender and generation.
   For one thing, she's pro-choice while he's anti-abortion.
   ``That's something that pre-dates my political involvement,''
she said, admitting that the two of them don't even discuss the
issue anymore.
   She said she also places a higher priority on the issues of day
care and parental leave.
   Molinari said she's fitting pretty well into the Washington
life, renting an apartment in nearby Alexandria, Va., and going
home on weekends to campaign. Having just won her congressional
seat, Molinari is up for re-election in November along with all
other House members.
   But she said it's hard being apart from her husband, John
Lucchesi, who runs a car service, and the rest of her family on
Staten Island.
   ``There's a certain loneliness that comes with being removed
from them but when you get to go home - and not to sound, like
gooey - but the night that you sleep in bed with your husband means
more because you haven't done it in five days.''

<HEAD>Pope Approved Two Married Priests, Cardinal Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Brazilian cardinal has disclosed that two
married men in his country became priests with the approval of the
pope, and says the church should seriously consider the ordination
of more married men.
   Cardinal Aloisio Lorscheider said papal approval of the two
ordinations came on condition the two men live with their wives as
``brother and sister,'' meaning they must abstain from sex.
   The disclosure by Lorscheider, which appeared in the Italian
magazine Famiglia Cristiana (Christian Family) in the third week of
a monthlong gathering of bishops, appeared to be an attempt to keep
the question of married priests alive.
   Pope John Paul II has resolutely opposed waiving the celibacy
rule for priests, and conservative bishops kept the subject off the
agenda of the bishops' synod, which among other issues is dealing
with the diminishing number of candidates for the priesthood
worldwide.
   Lorscheider, one of more than 200 bishops attending the synod,
said allowing ordination of married men could help alleviate the
shortage of priests in some areas.
   ``There are Christian communities, not only in the Third World,
which desire the Eucharist and can't receive it,'' he said. ``We
need to seriously study the issue.''
   Roman Catholic church rules require priests to be celibate and
forsake marriage. Protestant and some Eastern-rite Catholic
churches allow married priests.
   The celibacy rule is based on the view that sex and marriage
would distract the priest from giving his complete attention to the
work of God.
   Lorscheider, archbishop of Fortaleza, Brazil, did not identify
the priests.
   A Vatican spokesman, Monsignor Piero Pennacchini, identified one
of them as Ivo Schmidt, who had been serving as permanent deacon of
the diocese of Federico Westphalen, a city of 500,000 people in
southern Brazil.
   The spokesman said he was still checking on the second married
priest. Italian newspapers reported he apparently lives in the
state of Pernambuco in northeastern Brazil.
   Both ordinations are said to have occurred at least four years
ago.
   Pennacchini and other Vatican and church officials noted that
exceptions to the celibacy rule have been made for priests from
other denominations who convert to Roman Catholicism.
   Dozens of married Episcopalians have done so in the United
States, for example. They are allowed to continue living normal
married lives.

<TEXT>
   Australia and New Zealand are cursing
the introduction of rabbits, foxes, opossums and other foreign
animals, which breed virtually unchecked because their natural
predators were not brought along.
   ``New Zealand could be said to be facing a creeping ecological
disaster with the impact of introduced species on our
environment,'' said Philip Woollaston, its conservation minister.
   ``We have a long and inglorious history of introducing new and
alien elements into our environment. Homesick settlers brought
familiar plants and animals to a country that looked foreign to
them.
   ``It has taken a long time for us to shake off the settler
mentality of wanting to create a Southern Hemisphere European
country.''
   Some alien species were assets. Sheep, cattle and various crops
have become economic mainstays of both countries, but the lists of
foreign pests are long.
   New Zealand's includes goats, chamois, opossums, wasps and deer.
Predators or parasites sometimes have been brought in as controls,
but they often created new problems.
   ``Foxes were once thought to be the answer to the rabbit
menace,'' Woollaston said. ``Fortunately, they did not take hold in
New Zealand as they have in Australia, where they have done
terrible damage to indigenous fauna.
   ``Unfortunately, stoats and weasels, which also were introduced
for rabbit control, have found New Zealand a very suitable
habitat.''
   The opossum, introduced from Australia in the 19th century for
its fur, now is the main threat in New Zealand. The government has
declared war on the animal, which outnumbers the 3.1 million New
Zealanders about 23 to 1.
   Opossums devastate foilage in many forests and carry a form of
tuberculosis that has infected other species, particularly cattle.
   There has been little resistance to poison pellets intended to
kill opossums, even though other animals also die.
   Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton said New Zealand needs a major
research project to find biological methods of wiping out the
opossum through disease or sterility without harming other species.
   ``We have to do the research ourselves because this is a
uniquely New Zealand problem,'' he said.
   Sutton said opossums could withstand a death rate of 5 million a
year without a permanent reduction of their numbers.
   Margaret Evans, mayor of the North Island city of Hamilton, has
suggested an opossum-hunting program to give jobs to the
unemployed.
   Foxes and rabbits were brought to Australia by Europeans to be
bred for hunting. They now are blamed for contributing to the
extinction of 18 marsupial species and threatening 30.
   Victoria state alone has about 25 million rabbits. Officials
estimate they cost the national wool and cattle industries $100
million a year, which does not include environmental damage.
   Steve Crabb, the state's environment minister suggests marketing
fox pelts as an ``environmentally friendly'' alternative to other
furs.
   While the rabbit destroys vegetation, the fox preys on birds,
reptiles and farm animals.
   ``The fox did not co-evolve with our native wildlife, so these
small animals have no defense mechanisms against it,'' said Clive
Marks of the Keith Turnbull Research Institute. ``We've never had a
predator like the fox. It's a very efficient killing machine.''
   Australia has strict quarantine laws to keep out rabies and
other animal diseases, and officials fear the fox as a carrier.
   ``Should we get rabies, our fox population would be the prime
spreader of the disease,'' Marks said.
   Introduction of fleas carrying the rabbit-specific myxoma virus
reduced the number of rabbits for a time until they developed
immunities. As with the opossum in New Zealand, the best hope for
controlling Australia's rabbits and foxes lies in research.
   Efforts are under way to genetically alter existing viruses so
they will make the animals sterile.
   No one seems to know what to do about the Queensland cane toad.
   Australia's only toad and was introduced from South America in
1935 to control the cane beetle and has been an ecological
disaster.
   Cane toads grow to 8 inches in length, eat virtually anything
that moves and are prolific breeders. When cornered, they squirt a
poison from neck glands that kills dogs, cats, even humans.
   Because of their bad experiences, Australia and New Zealand look
closely at any proposals to introduce new species.
   New Zealand recently rejected plans to raise catfish on fish
farms and thousands that had been in quarantine were destroyed.
Sport fishermen feared catfish would escape and destroy the trout,
another foreign creature that has flourished.

many former Sandinista leaders who once espoused Marxism are now

   A lot of this is going on, though exactly how much is not clear.
Estimates of the number of Sandinista companies range from 20 or 30
to nearly 300, but there are no official records.
   The source of the money is also in doubt. President Violeta
Chamorro's government found the treasury nearly empty when it took
over in April.
   ``The companies are legal,'' said a government official who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The question is where they got
the means.''
   Sandinista commercial interests now include stores, newspapers,
radio stations, farms, real estate, export-import corporations and
a television station. Some are owned outright by the Sandinista
Front (FSLN) and others by members with the front as a minority
stockholder.
   ``There is nothing wrong with a political party being in
business within the framework of free enterprise,'' said Herti
Lewites, the former Sandinista tourism minister, who is setting up
some of the enterprises.
   ``If I can make every member of the FSLN rich, I will,'' he
said.
   Lewites acknowledged that some Marxist activists find the sudden
entrepreneurial impulses of their fellows perplexing.
   ``Some of our militants and people in the government cannot
quite assimilate this yet,'' he said.
   One of the most visible Sandinista enterprises is Central
American Airlines, or CAAL, which is to begin Miami-Managua flights
beginning Oct. 27 using a rented Boeing 727 at the outset.
   The airlines will charge $275 roundtrip, the lowest fare between
the two cities among carriers serving the region. The ticket is to
include free cocktails.
   ``There is no reason why, within a year, we should not be flying
to Europe also,'' said Lewites. The airline eventually plans
flights to Los Angeles and San Francisco, Mexico City, Madrid,
Spain, and London.
   Lewites has variously described the company's investors as Saudi
Arabians, Greeks and Lebanese.
   In an interview last week he said the Sandinista Front had a 25
percent interest in the airline and his personal stake was 3
percent.
   But at Wednesday's news conference officially launching the
airline, Lewites said there was no Sandinista ownership.
   ``I don't think even Herti's grandmother believes that,''
snickered a journalist from the Cuban government's Prensa Latina
news agency.
   The Sandinistas led the long struggle that overthrew the late
President Anastasio Somzoa in July 1979. Many of their leaders
espoused Marxist ideology and had trained in communist countries.
   While in power, the Sandinistas frequently promised to support a
mixed economy, with plenty of room for private investors. In
practice the government seemed to make its economic policy as it
went along. Nationalizations of companies and land often appeared
arbitrary, or aimed at political enemies.
   The Sandinistas' economic policies and a U.S.-sponsored
guerrilla war destroyed the economy.
   When the Sandinistas ran in free elections in February, te
voters rejected them for a more conservative coalition led by Mrs.
Chamorro.
   Most of the Sandinista companies are headed by former government
officials, some of whom had left family businesses to join the
Sandinista revolution.
   Opponents claim some of the companies were stolen or set up with
government funds and equipment. Sandinista officials have said the
party squirreled away money supplied over the years by sympathetic
foreign governments and other sources.
   Some businesses require little or no investment. Fernando
Guzman, a former Sandinista front official, has the party as a
minority partner in several companies, including two import-export
firms.
   ``The FSLN helped me get some of the contacts,'' he said.
   The Sandinistas established trading companies in the United
States, Panama and elsewhere years ago to circumvent the U.S.
embargo on trade with Nicaragua.
   Manuel Espinoza, who was former President Daniel Ortega's press
officer, obtained a concession for a television station before the
Sandinistas left power.
   As Lewites put it: ``The party must have resources. Things must
change. We cannot live off politics alone.
   ``We are going to give the party a new image,'' he added. ``We
are eliminating old taboos.''

<HEAD>Thou Shalt Not Violate Government Ethics Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's not exactly Moses coming down from the
mount with a set of tablets, but President Bush has an updated set
of ``standards of ethical conduct'' for government officers and
employees.
   For instance:
   Thou shalt not ``hold financial interests that conflict with the
conscientious performance of duty.''
   Thou shalt not ``solicit or accept any gift or other item of
monetary value from any person or entity seeking official action
from, doing business with, or conducting activities regulated by
the employee's agency.''
   Thou shalt not ``use public office for private gain.''
   These rules are contained in an order Bush signed Wednesday ``to
establish fair and exacting standards of ethical conduct for all
executive branch employees.''
   The order does not merely forbid. It seeks what every
right-thinking citizen wishes for his country. Such as:
   -``Employees shall put forth honest effort in the performance of
their duties.''
   -``Employees shall disclose waste, fraud, abuse and corruption
to appropriate authorities.''
   The White House assures that these principles are not new for
the Bush administration; that the president's executive order is
``minor fine-tuning'' of ethical standards put in place on April
12, 1989.
   On that day, Bush unveiled a fat package of proposals covering
activities by executive branch employees as well as judges and
Congress. It touched on campaign finance laws and acceptance of
speech fees by congressmen.
   The new order covers executive branch employees and officers
whose boss is George Bush. These are the same employees who stand
to be furloughed in wholesale numbers if there is no budget
agreement by Friday midnight.
   The order said some fundamental principles of ethical service
are in place ``to ensure that every citizen can have complete
confidence in the integrity of the federal government.''
   It frowns on employees using federal property ``for other than
authorized activities'' and forbids moonlighting jobs outside of
government for most employees, ``including seeking or negotiating
for employment.''
   It says employees should obey the laws bearing on equal
opportunity regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national
origin, age or handicap.
   And it thinks employees, like Caesar's wife, must be above
suspicion:
   ``Employees shall endeavor to avoid any actions creating the
appearance that they are violating the law ....''
   The rest is more governmentese than Bible. Who is responsible
for administering the order? The Office of Government Ethics.
   What will that office do? It will do ``promulgating ...
developing, disseminating and periodically updating.'' And, of
course, ``ensuring.''
   One of the minor changes the document makes from the 1989 order
is allowing lower-paid, full-time, non-career government employees
to engage in moonlighting.
   All the while, of course, adhering to standards of conduct
expected of a government employee.

<HEAD>Los Angeles City Council Votes Down Restaurant Smoking Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Council has snuffed out a proposed
smoking ban in restaurants, deciding instead to consider having
partitions and ventilation systems clear the air for non-smoking
diners.
   The council deadlocked 6-6 on the outright ban Tuesday before
voting 8-4 to draft the compromise ordinance for restaurants
serving more than 50 patrons.
   Los Angeles already prohibits smoking in supermarkets, elevators
and at public meetings and requires non-smoking areas in all large
restaurants.
   Smaller cities, including San Luis Obispo, Sacramento and Aspen,
Colo., have passed restaurant smoking bans, but Los Angeles, with
its nearly 4 million residents, would have become the first major
city to do so.
   ``Why shouldn't Los Angeles be a leader here?'' asked Councilman
Marvin Braude, who proposed the unsuccessful measure. ``This ban is
inevitable. Let's move forward and do it today.''
   Restaurant lobbyists hailed defeat of the measure but attacked
the compromise proposal that requires partitions and vents as a
similar threat to the economic survival of many establishments.
   ``It's not a great compromise if we're going to put restaurants
out of business,'' said Rudy Cole, executive director of a
coalition known as RSVP, Restaurants for a Sensible Voluntary
Policy (On Smoking). The group claims to represent 1,000 of thses to adopt
quotas in hiring and promotion,'' Bush said
Tuesday. He said that if the measure reached his desk, he would
``be compelled to veto it.''
   The Senate on Tuesday night approved the measure, 62-34, short
of the two-thirds support that sponsors would need to override the
threatened veto.
   Fifty-three Democrats and nine Republicans joined in supporting
the measure, while 34 Republicans were opposed.
   Civil rights forces said they could count on the votes of three
absent senators and thus needed only two more to reach the 67
required for an override. But the roll call revealed that despite
many concessions they had gained no new support since July 18 when
an earlier version cleared, 65-34.
   The House was due to vote today on the bill, which would
effectively overturn six Supreme Court decisions handed down last
year. It has been the civil rights movement's top priority on
Capitol Hill in recent months.
   Provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in the
workplace to punitive damages in extreme discrimination cases.
   The major controversy, though, is over proposed changes in
complex court rules governing job discrimination lawsuits. The
changes would make it easier for those filing suit to win and
harder for employers to defend themselves.
   The administration and business critics of the bill say
employers would adopt quotas as a ready-made defense in case they
were taken to court. Sponsors of the bill scoff at this notion.
   Civil rights leaders who visited with Bush in May in an effort
to reach a compromise pla to ask for another chance to make the
pitch for the bill and head off a veto.
   ``This is going to be a defining issue for the Bush
administration and civil rights,'' said Ralph Neas, executive
director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
   He said a veto could resemble the ``Bob Jones University
fiasco,'' in which a storm erupted the Reagan administration's move
to grant tax-exempt status to that institution despite charges that
it practiced discrimination.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said, ``I believe there is a
good chance that President Bush will sign this bill. But if he
vetoes it, I think there is a good chance Congress will override
the veto.''
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who voted for the bill, held out hope
that even after months of disagreement the administration and
sponsors could reach a compromise. He said talks were getting under
way again. A summer of negotiations that were revived briefly in
September have produced nothing.
   Some lawmakers believe Bush will opt to ``pocket veto'' the
bill, allowing it to die for lack of a signature after Congress
adjourns and leaves Washington for the campaign trail.
   Both sides in the debate have acknowledged that the sheer
complexity of the measure has led to confusion.
   ``It is not ... a battle between David Duke and the rest of us
for the soul of the Republican Party,'' Sen. John C. Danforth,
R-Mo., said. ``It is a quibbling over words that lawyers have been
involved in.''
   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, was critical earlier of
Republicans for opposing the bill. ``Is this the Republican Party
of Abraham Lincoln?'' he said. ``Or is this the Republican Party of
David Duke?''
   GOP lawmakers winced at the mention of Duke, a former Ku Klux
Klan leader and current Louisiana state legislator who counts
himself as a Republican even though GOP officials have taken
enormous pains to repudiate him.
   ``I think bringing in David Duke is hitting below the belt a
bit,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
   Metzenbaum came back to the floor contritely later and said it
had been ``inappropriate and improper'' to associate Republicans
with Duke.

<HEAD>Concert Pianist Jorge Bolet Dead at 75</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jorge Bolet, regarded as one of the
last of the great romantic concert pianists, has died of heart
failure at age 75.
   Bolet, who died Tuesday at his Mountain View home, retired from
the concert stage last year because of declining health. His last
public performance was at a Berlin recital June 8, 1989.
   ``There may be others who can play the notes, but Bolet, with
his roots in an older tradition than most today ... has a feeling
for the line, the elegance, the suave sound, the tapered phrase of
high romanticism that is virtually unmatched today,'' Harold
Schonberg said of the pianist in a 1978 review for The New York
Times.
   Although not widely known early in his career, Bolet came to
prominence during the past decade as the music of Franz Liszt
enjoyed a resurgence of popularity.
   He made more than two dozen recordings for London/Decca Records
in the 1980s, including nine of piano works by Liszt. He also
recorded music by Brahms, Grieg, Rachmaninoff, Schumann,
Tchaikovsky and Debussy.
   His last recordings, of two Chopin sonatas and selected
nocturnes, were made in March.
   The Cuban-born Bolet also taught at Indiana University from 1970
to 1977 and headed the piano department at Philadelphia's Curtis
Institute from 1977 to 1986.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen faces a difficult balancing
act this week as he helps shepherd a deficit-reduction plan through
the Senate.
   As chairman of the Finance Committee, he aims to promote a
compromise that can pass a divided Senate.
   As a national Democratic leader, he knows that position could
blunt his party's class-conscious attack on President Bush.
   So the Texas senator is doing his best to have it both ways -
doing the former and talking the latter.
   Bentsen and Senate Republicans have crafted a moderate
deficit-reduction plan, a collection of new taxes and spending cuts
devoid of the soak-the-rich elements House Democrats put in their
package.
   ``When the country has these serious problems, you've got to put
the country first and not worry about the political consequences,''
he said.
   But Bentsen also expressed longing for what the House Democrats
could do with their overwhelming majority and spiced his discussion
with digs at Bush.
   ``I wanted to raise the tax rate on the top six-tenths of 1
percent of the people,'' he lamented. ``But there was no way I
could get the bill out of committee.''
   ``The American people were fed up with our not coming to an
agreement and the president not ... bringing about the agreement,
not seeing that kind of leadership,'' Bentsen said in a television
appearance Sunday.
   He kept up the criticism in an interview Tuesday.
   ``I think the president should be here involved and exercising
leadership'' instead of making campaign trips for Republican
candidates, he said.
   What does not emerge is whether Bentsen has his own campaign
trips at the back of his mind. Will the Democratic vice
presidential nominee of 1988 seek the top job in 1992?
   ``I've got loads to lift here,'' he laughed.
   Those loads include a long list of unpopular tax increases and
cuts in benefit programs, raising Americans' costs for everything
from beer to doctors' visits.
   ``This gets in the way of any national political ambition
anybody may have,'' said Jack DeVore, Bentsen's longtime spokesman.
   In 1988, another former Senate Finance chairman, Sen. Bob Dole,
R-Kan., had his campaign for the GOP presidential nomination
derailed in part because he drafted a deficit-reduction plan that
included tax increases. Dole tried to make the deficit an issue,
refused to sign a no-new-taxes pledge and was defeated by Bush.
   But Dole maintains that having served as chairman of the
tax-writing committee actually was ``a big plus'' in his campaign.
Compared with other candidates, he had a broad knowledge of federal
programs that voters wanted to talk about.
   As for his loss, Dole said, ``That was partly our fault ... We
sat on a lead we thought we had.''
   The tax issue hurts most ``if you allow the opponents to
characterize it,'' agreed David Moore, a political scientist at the
University of New Hampshire. Bentsen's early refusal to exempt home
heating oil from a proposed petroleum tax ``obviously could be an
issue that could be used against him'' and must be handled
skillfully, he said.
   But while taxes are at the center of GOP politics, Bentsen's
compromising could renew suspicions in his party that he's not the
populist he sometimes portrays himself to be, said Republican
campaign consultant Eddie Mahe.
   After his vice presidential run, Bentsen rejoined private clubs
he quit for the campaign and resumed his push for tax breaks for
the oil industry.
   ``He wants his cake and wants to eat it, too,'' Mahe said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are major provisions in a Democratic
deficit-reduction plan approved by the House Tuesday:
   INDEXING: Forgo for one year the annual adjustments to income
tax brackets and personal exemptions, which are designed to protect
against inflation-caused bracket creep. That would mean higher
income taxes in 1991 for everybody except the wealthiest.
   TAX RATES: Raise the 28 percent top rate paid by the wealthiest
people - single people with taxable income over $97,620 and couples
above $162,770 - to 33 percent. Impose a 10 percent surtax on those
with taxable incomes over $1 million.
   GASOLINE: Unlike other plans, the bill contains no change in
taxes on gasoline or heating oil.
   ALCOHOL: Raise the $12.50-a-gallon tax on 100-proof liquor by
$1; double the beer tax to 32 cents a six-pack; raise taxes on most
wines, including, for example, table wine, which would go from 3
cents a 750-milliliter bottle to 25 cents.
   TOBACCO: Raise the 16-cent cigarette tax by 4 cents in 1991 and
another 4 cents in 1993. Snuff, cigars and other tobacco would face
25 percent tax increases each year.
   FLYING: Raise the 8 percent tax on airline tickets to 10
percent.
   LUXURIES: Impose a 10 percent tax on the portion of the price of
cars above $30,000, private boats and planes above $100,000,
jewelry above $5,000 and furs above $10,000.
   CAPITAL GAINS: Allow a person to avoid tax on half of up to
$200,000 of capital gains earned in a lifetime; the gains could
come from most investments but not from stocks. A person with
annual income under $100,000 could avoid tax on an additional
$1,000 a year of gains, including those on the sale of stock. No
capital gain would be taxed at a rate above 28 percent.
   LOW-INCOME: Increase the earned-income tax credit, which
benefits low-income families with children, as a way of offsetting
some of the increased excise taxes.
   MEDICARE TAXES: Increase to $100,000 the maximum annual wage to
which the 1.45 percent Medicare tax applies. The tax is withheld as
part of the Social Security tax.
   MEDICARE PREMIUMS: Raise the $28.60 monthly premium for Medicare
Part B insurance to $29.90 next year and $46.20 by 1995.
   MEDICARE DEDUCTIBLE: Raise to $100 through 1995 the present $75
deductible, which beneficiaries must pay before Medicare starts
paying for doctor bills.
   SOCIAL SECURITY: Require all state and local government workers
who are not covered by a public retirement plan to pay Social
Security taxes.

   Students at the National Fire Academy
sometimes are given a field assignment: Find as many fire code
violations as you can at the nation's top fire safety training
center.
   There are 180.
   Embarrassed federal fire officials hope federal budget-cutters
this year don't ax the $4.6 million needed to comply with the
Maryland state fire code. The money was part of a $78 billion
spending package passed Tuesday by an appropriations conference
committee.
   The center has corrected minor fire code violations in the past
few years, but now needs $4.6 million to make structural changes to
buildings that have failed inspections by the state fire marshal's
office.
   The state last inspected the campus April 27 and plans to return
Nov. 4.
   ``Not all of those 180 violations are considered
life-threatening, but they do have a few that are serious,'' Deputy
State Fire Marshal Bob Thomas said Tuesday.
   Inadequate exits in the campus dining hall and auditorium are
the two most urgent problems, he said.
   ``This is our national fire station, and we need to make sure it
is fit for duty,'' said Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., chairman of
the Appropriations Subcommittee on Veteran's Administration,
Department of Housing and Urban Development and Independent
Agencies.
   The fire academy's money still must pass floor votes in both
chambers and be signed by President Bush.
   The fire academy, part of the National Emergency Management
Agency, has been based on a quiet campus of old, red-brick
buildings in the Catoctin Mountains 70 miles northwest of
Washington since 1980.
   Each year, thousands of career and volunteer firefighters attend
training sessions to learn the latest in fire prevention and fire
department management.

   Palestinian leaders today boycotted a planned
meeting with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and denounced
Israel's refusal to accept a U.N. investigation of last week's
Temple Mount killings.
   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has appealed to
President Bush to ``put the Temple Mount incident behind us'' but
again rejected a United Nations probe of the killings at the sacred
site, a spokesman said today.
   The Security Council voted unanimously on Friday to condemn the
fatal police shootings of 19 Palestinians on Oct. 8 on Jerusalem's
Temple Mount. The resolution ordered a three-member investigation
team to be sent to Jerusalem.
   The police assault in Jerusalem's Old City began after
Palestinians began hurling stones from the Temple Mount down on
Jewish worshipers at the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site.
   The appeal to Bush to repair torn U.S.-Israeli ties came in a
letter sent after Shamir's Cabinet turned down the U.N. probe, said
Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner.
   Israel's refusal to meet a U.N. investigating delegation has
increased tension in U.S.-Israel relations, but a senior official
said Israeli leaders were privately seeking a compromise.
   One proposal being studied, the official said, was to submit to
the United Nations the results of Israel's own investigation. The
Israeli report is expected to be ready by the end of the month.
   The Palestinian leaders' boycott of their planned meeting with
the British foreign secretary came after statements attributed to
Hurd in Israeli news reports that Britain opposed a Palestinian
state.
   The British Consulate in Arab east Jerusalem issued a statement
saying Hurd's remarks had been misreported.
   The 27 Palestinians who were to have met with Hurd instead
signed a statement and had it delivered to him.
   ``Israel's refusal to cooperate with the (U.N.) secretary
general's mission of investigation is symptomatic not only of its
continued intransigence, but also of its contempt for the will of
the Security Council and for the internationally recognized rights
of the Palestinian people,'' the Palestinian statement said.
   Shamir's letter to Bush was sent Monday, a day after the Cabinet
rejected the weekend Security Council resolution condemning the
killings and ordering the U.N. probe.
   Pazner declined to make the letter public but summarized
portions in a telephone interview.
   He said Shamir rejected a U.N. probe ``for the simple reason
that this resolution ... contains only a one-sided condemnation and
doesn't mention the attack on Jews. Above all it deals a blow to
Israeli sovereignty'' over Jerusalem.''
   Pazner said that in the letter, Shamir ``suggests to Bush to put
the Temple Mount incident behind us and continue dialogue between
Israel and Washington.''
   The Mount is sacred to both religions, and Palestinians
maintained they began throwing stones after rumors spread that a
Jewish extremist group was marching to the site, which is under the
control of Moslem clerics.
   The Old City is part of land that Israel annexed after capturing
it from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war. Most Western countries
do not recognize Israel's annexation of predominantly Arab east
Jerusalem and consider it to be occupied territory like the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   News of Shamir's letter follows urging by both Bush and
Secretary of State James A. Baker III that Israel reverse its
decision to boycott the U.N. mission.
   ``It is the only way Israel will be able to make its case to the
Security Council,'' Baker said in Washington on Tuesday.
   Pazner insisted Shamir's letter to the president offered no
compromise on the issue of a U.N. probe.
   But a senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the government was contemplating offering to give the United
Nations a report on the shootings by a three-man Israeli
investigating commission.
   The Israeli investigators, headed by former Mossad spy chief Zvi
Zamir, were expected to finish taking testimony today and compile
their report by the month's end.
   Israeli human rights activists already have criticized the
Israeli invesgitation as inadequate, saying it cannot be truly
independent since it is not headed by a judge and has no power to
subpoena witnesses.

   The Irish Republican Army said
today it killed a former police reservist, and the Ulster Freedom
Fighters said it gunned down a Catholic man.
   The former reservist, identified as Stephen Craig, 24, from
Bangor in County Down, and a Roman Catholic civilian, Dermot
McGuinness, 41, of north Belfast, died in separate shootings
Tuesday night, police said.
   The Ulster Freedom Fighters is the military wing of the outlawed
Ulster Defense Association, which claims to defend the Protestant
majority in Northern Ireland.
   The McGuinness family made a plea that there be no attempt to
avenge the killing.
   ``Grief is grief no matter what side of the community it affects
and I would appeal to those considering retaliation to desist,''
said Pascal O'Hare, whose niece Mary is McGuinness' widow.
   ``Nothing has or can be achieved by it. Twenty years of violence
in this country has got us nowhere,'' O'Hare said.
   Police said the two attacks occurred in predominantly Catholic
areas about two miles apart.
   Police said in the first attack a gunman got out of a car,
believed stolen from the Protestant stronghold Shankill area of
west Belfast, and opened fire on McGuinness, who was returning home
from a liquor store.
   Craig was shot and killed in a hotel parking lot an hour later,
police said. He had been drinking with friends in the hotel and was
shot as he waited for a taxi to take him home, police said.
   Legislator Cecil Walker, a member of the Ulster Unionist Party,
which is committed to British rule in Northern Ireland, called
today for a stepped-up police effort.
   ``There needs to be more covert operations,'' he said. ``The
authorities are not looking at the situation seriously enough and
until such time as they do then I'm afraid we're going to get more
and more of these killings.''
   The IRA said in a message to Belfast media Tuesday it was also
responsible for an attack on two policemen in Belfast on Saturday.
One of the policemen died Monday. The other was hospitalized in
serious but stable condition.
   The mainly Catholic IRA wants to unite Northern Ireland with the
Irish Republic. Protestant loyalists are fighting to maintain
British rule.

   Thousands of Vietnamese lined the
streets of Hanoi today to pay their respects to Le Duc Tho, the
silver-haired statesman best known for his role in the Paris peace
talks that ended the Vietnam war.
   Vietnam's state radio said the funeral procession, accompanied
by top Vietnamese leaders, made its way to the state Mai Dich
cemetery, the resting place of many other of the country's
dignitaries.
   The radio said Communist Party chief Nguyen Van Linh, other
leaders and Tho's family escorted the flag-draped coffin. It did
not say when the burial would take place.
   Tho died of an unspecified illness on Saturday in Hanoi, three
days after his 79th birthday.
   In a eulogy, Linh praised Tho for his long career as a
revolutionary and his contributions to the victory over U.S.-backed
South Vietnam that led to Communist rule over a united Vietnam.
   The Vietnam News Agency said more than 130 Vietnamese and
foreign delegations had paid respects to Tho on Tuesday as his body
lay in state in a conference hall in the capital.
   His death marked another step in Vietnam's transition away from
leadership by aged hard-liners and toward more pragmatic policies
of economic reform and expanded ties with the West.
   Former party chief Le Duazation of agricultural land.
   RUSSIAN PLAN - Would end state control over businesses and
property, with the private sector prevailing in most industries and
private citizens, not agencies, as property holders. Some property
would be sold at low or symbolic cost to labor collectives. Leasing
might be possible, as would be private family property, but the
republics would determine some forms of ownership.
   ---
   BUDGET, FINANCING&equals;
   GORBACHEV PLAN - Federal budget would be financed through
federal taxes. Republics and localities would also have the right
to levy taxes. A central bank would be created to control money
supply and credit, and the ruble would be the only legal tender
throughout the country.
   YELTSIN PLAN: Strict control on state spending, reform of the
banking system. Russia would issue its own currency.
   ---
   CENTRAL CONTROL&equals;
   GORBACHEV PLAN - Central government to retain control of
defense, energy production, nuclear power, highway and rail
systems, space exploration, maritime affairs. Republics would
control their own resources, although details apparently would be
left to a proposed ``inter-republic economic committee,'' with as
yet undefined enforcement powers.
   YELTSIN PLAN - Economic union would be on a voluntary basis;
central government would control most national security affairs,
although not all foreign relations. Republics largely would control
their own energy resources.

<HEAD>Woman Cleared of Charges She Gave Drugs to Her Unborn Child</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An indictment charging a woman with providing
cocaine to her unborn child has been thrown out by a Superior Court
judge, who called the charge a violation of the woman's right to
privacy.
   Judge Suzanne V. DelVecchio on Tuesday dismissed a drug
distribution indictment against 24-year-old Josephine Pellegrini, a
mother of three, for cocaine found in the system of her infant,
Nathan.
   Prosecutors said they had pursued the case to discourage
pregnant women from taking illegal drugs.
   But DelVecchio said in a 16-page ruling that ``there is no
familiar bond more intimate and more fundamental than that between
the mother and the fetus she carries in her womb.''
   She added: ``This court will not permit the destruction of this
relationship by the prosecution.''
   Pellegrini of Brockton was indicted by a Plymouth County grand
jury in September 1989 on charges of distributing cocaine to a
minor and cocaine possession. A drug screening by doctors at
Brockton Hospital found cocaine in the urine of her son, born July
2, 1989.
   After reviewing Nathan's medical records, authorities determined
Pellegrini must have ingested cocaine shortly before Nathan's
birth.
   Instead of prosecution, DelVecchio suggested ``education and
making available medical care and drug treatment centers for
pregnant women'' to deal with increased drug abuse.
   ``By imposing criminal sanctions, a woman may turn away from
seeking prenatal care for fear of being discovered, thereby
undermining the state's asserted interests,'' she said in the
ruling. ``The state's interests would be further undermined when
women seek to terminate their pregnancies for fear of criminal
sanctions.''
   Nancy Gertner, a lawyer who argued as a friend-of-the-court for
dismissal, said the decision is a first in Massachusetts courts and
could be used as a precedent nationwide.
   Geline Williams, the assistant prosecutor handling the case,
said her office has not decided whether to appeal or to continue
pursuing cocaine possession charges against Pellegrini.

<HEAD>Semi-Submerged Soviet Ship Said to Pose Radiation Danger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The radioactive hulk of a
semi-submerged Soviet ship in a lake near the Finnish border poses
a major environmental hazard, a Finnish radiation safety official
said today.
   ``We have every reason to be worried and urgently need more
information about the hulk,'' said Olli Vilkamo, senior inspector
at the Finnish Center for Radiation and Nuclear Safety.
   The German-built ship, sunk in Lake Ladoga 30 miles from the
Finnish-Soviet border, was reportedly used in Soviet secret
military experiments during the 1950s.
   Lake Ladoga supplies drinking water for 5 million people in
Leningrad, the second-largest Soviet city. It is the largest
freshwater lake in Europe.
   Finnish officials first learned of the existence of the
radioactive hulk from Finnish television journalists who had
obtained a Soviet-made documentary on the subject, Vilkamo said.
Finnish television broadcast the film Tuesday.
   The Soviet report said the ship contained 2,000 tons of
radioactive water containing strontium 90, a deadly substance
present in fallout from nuclear explosions.
   ``If the reports are true, then it's a lot ... and definitely
there is a great risk here. Strontium 90 is extremely dangerous.
Great caution has to be exercised in moving the hulk or pumping out
the radioactive water,'' Vilkamo said.
   Finnish officials will assist Soviet authorities in every way
possible, Vilkamo said but added that ``they have their own very
good experts, and we are confident they can deal with it.''
   A treaty between Finland and the Soviet Union obliges the two
countries to report accidents and radioactive leaks to one another,
but Vilkamo said he was uncertain whether the presence of the ship
came under the agreement.

   Thieves broke through a window at the
Community Soup Kitchen and stole 120 pounds of roast beef that was
meant to feed lunch to more than 250 poor and homeless people.
   ``What a nasty, nasty thing,'' said William A. Sherry, a member
of the soup kitchen's board of directors. ``Stealing food from a
soup kitchen. I mean, how low can you get?''
   But the robbers unwittingly left behind a small blessing.
   By leaving the soup kitchen's refrigerator open, they thawed 150
pounds of frozen fish sticks that made enough meals to feed lunch
to the poor on Tuesday.
   David O'Sullivan, the coordinator of the soup kitchen, said he
left 120 pounds of frozen, cajun-style roast beef in a locked
storeroom, thawing for Tuesday's lunch. But when he arrived at work
Tuesday, a window was shattered and the meat boxes were empty.
   ``It's really discouraging that people are stealing from those
who need it most,'' he said.

   Fire scorched nearly all 450 acres of the
Ahihud collective farm today, driving out hundreds of families. A
fire chief said it was the worst blaze ever in Galilee.
   The brush fire killed some cows, destroyed some homes in Ahihud
and blocked a main highway in northern Israel. It threatened a
nearby kibbutz and two Arab-Iraeli villages, all just east of the
biblical city of Acre.
   Air force helicopters were rushed in to extinguish the blaze.
   The West Galilee fire chief, Yossi Ben-Ezra, said it was the
worst fire ever in Galilee.
   ``It's terrible, my future is over,'' farmer Yehiya Damti of
Ahihud said on Israel radio as he viewed his burned fields, barn
and livestock. ``It just makes me want to commit suicide.''
   The fire was one of several that broke out today in Galilee.
Ben-Ezra said the cause of the fires was unclear, but unseasonably
hot weather and dust storms had spread the flames.
   Palestinian activists often have called for setting fire to
Israeli property as part of their 34-month uprising against Israeli
rule in the occupied lands. Ben-Ezra said no clear evidence of
arson had been found.
   He said about a 20-mile stretch of main highway linking Acre to
the holy Jewish city of Safed had been closed for several hours
because of the fire.
   About 100 families in Ahihud were evacuated by buses to a nearby
settlement for several hours until the fire was brought under
control. Eight people were treated for smoke inhalation, Ben-Ezra
said.
   Air force helicopters also took several hours to put out  fire
in Yarka, an Arab village.
   It was the second straight day of brush fires in northern
Israel.
   On Tuesday nearly 500 acres of woodland were scorched by an
unexplained fire that destroyed some 300-year-old trees. Some of
Tuesday's fires started accidentally and spread by the wind,
Israeli newspapers said.

<TEXT>
   The City Council has embraced an extensive
AIDS policy asserting sufferers' rights and promoting prevention
with controversial methods including distribution of condoms and
hypodermic sterilization kits.
   ``It is a policy that establishes a national model,'' Councilman
Joel Wachs said. ``It is a reaffirmation of our city's unwavering
commitment to stand by people with AIDS.
   ``It is fair to say that AIDS is nothing less than a national
crisis.''
   The City Council voted 11-1 Tuesday to adopt a policy that
``declares AIDS a natural disaster and a global emergency.''
   About 112,000 people in Los Angeles County are infected with the
AIDS virus and more than 60,000 of those people live within the
city limits, the document said.
   The policy calls for increased spending on acquired immune
deficiency syndrome at all levels of government. City departments
have six months to plan implementation and determine costs. The
community development department was ordered to estimate the
policy's long-term fiscal implications.
   The document outlines new problems, such as training for city
employees and distribution of AIDS prevention kits, including
condoms and hypodermic needle-cleaning bleach kits, to people being
released from jail.
   The county, not the city, runs the jail system and the county
Board of Supervisors has twice gone on record against public
distribution of condoms and bleach kits.
   The blueprint reinforces the city's stand against
discrimination, the position that AIDS patients have a right not to
disclose their condition and that casual contact doesn't spread
AIDS. It gives city employees the right to withhold information on
whether they have the disease.
   The policy also affirms that everyone with the disease has a
right to dignity, respect, civil rights and a choice of care and
treatment options.
   The policy urges the federal government to reverse immigration
policies that exclude people who test positive to the HIV virus
that causes AIDS. It also opposes mandatory HIV testing and mass
quarantines of AIDS patients.
   Councilman Robert Farrell called it ``a document of love,
commitment and passion.''
   Colleague Michael Woo said: ``I feel we are being a beacon for
the rest of the country.''
   Mayor Tom Bradley urged cities nationwide to follow the lead.
   Councilman Ernani Bernardi was the lone dissenter. He said the
only way to battle the AIDS epidemic is to identify those with the
disease.

   Islamic fundamentalists are seeking to
ban alcohol and ``debauchery'' at some tourist hotels, in the
latest move to impose Koranic law in areas where they took power in
elections four months ago.
   Algerian dock workers, meanwhile, refused to unload the French
car ferry Napoleon because it had previously transported French
soldiers and military equipment to the Persian Gulf region.
   The dock workers delayed the ferry's unloading by two hours
Tuesday as ``a sign of solidarity with Iraq,'' a union official
said.
   The fundamentalists of the Islamic Salvation Front swept June 12
council elections, Algeria's first free vote since indpendence
from France in 1962, and are the leading party going into
legislative voting next spring.
   Fundamentalists on the provincial council of Bouira, east of the
capital, said Tuesday that potential loss of tourist revenue does
not outweigh the need to enforce Islamic law at the hotels.
   The hotels that are the target of their anti-alcohol campaign
are frequented mostly by foreign tourists on their way to the
rugged region, one of this North African country's main tourist
attractions.

<HEAD>Ukrainian Prime Minister To Resign Following Huge Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Ukrainian prime minister has decided to resign
following huge street marches, classroom boycotts and hunger
strikes by students opposed to his government, Tass said today.
   In the largest demonstration during the two-week protest, as
many as 100,000 students reportedly marched today down the main
street of Kiev, the Ukrainian capital.
   The official Soviet news agency said Ukrainian President Leonid
Kravchuk told the republic's legislature this morning that the
prime minister, Vitaly Masol, intends to resign.
   Tass quoted an unidentified parliamentary source as saying Masol
informed the president of his decision to quit on Tuesday, but had
not formally submitted his resignation by late today.
   Masol, 62, was appointed prime minister in June.
   Several dozen students began a hunger strike in Kiev two weeks
ago to press for Masol's resignation, dissolution of parliament and
new elections.
   Throughout the republic, thousands of students have supported
the hunger strikers in street demonstrations and classroom
boycotts.
   Rukh, the nationalist Ukrainian organization, said 100,000
students marched peacefully through Kiev today to the republic's
Supreme Soviet building. Rukh spokesman Romanna Meinichenko said by
telephone from Kiev that he had no information about Masol.
   Meinichenko said about 200 students are still on a hunger
strike, some in front of the Supreme Soviet and the others in a
tent camp in October Revolution Square in the city center.
   The hunger strikers also are demanding that the Ukraine
nationalize Communist Party property and refuse to sign a new
treaty linking the 15 Soviet republics with the central government.
They want Ukrainians drafted into the Red Army to be permitted to
serve within the republic's borders.
   Interfax, an unofficial arm of Radio Moscow, said 20,000
students boycotted classes in the Lvov region near the Polish
border on Tuesday, and 40 students and instructors from the
Polytechnic Institute staged a one-day hunger strike.
   It said 1,500 high school and trade school students picketed the
building of the Lvov region Communist Party committee.
   On Monday, students went on strike in Kiev and up to 50,000
marched through the city to the Ukrainian parliament building,
Interfax reported.
   Interfax said thousands of students carrying blue and yellow
Ukrainian flags marched through Kiev again on Tuesday in an
unsuccessful attempt to enlist worker support.
   The Ukraine is one of 13 Soviet republics seeking greater
autonomy from the central government in Moscow.

<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Douglas Campbell, the first
American-trained World War I to be called an ace for shooting down
five enemy planes, has died of respiratory failure at age 94.
   Campbell, who died Tuesday at his Greenwich home, shot down six
German planes over France during April, May and June of 1918. His
exploits are recounted in the 1984 book ``Let's Go Where The Action
Is: The Wartime Experiences of Douglas Campbell,'' by Jack Eder.
   Two American pilots, Maj. William Thaw and Capt. D.M.K.
Peterson, had each previously downed five planes, but they trained
in France with the Lafayette Escadrille, not under American
commanders.
   Campbell left Harvard University after his senior year in 1917
to begin his military career with the 94th Squadron, known as the
``Hat in the Ring'' squadron, of the First Pursuit Group.
   He learned to fly at the Army Flying School in France, then flew
the first American mission over enemy lines on March 6, 1918, with
Eddie Rickenbacker, a race-car driver who became the leading
fighter ace in American military history by shooting down 26
planes.
   Campbell was wounded by a bullet fragment during a dogfight over
France, when he shot down his last German plane, but managed to fly
back to base safely. He was discharged as a captain and received
the American Distinguished Service Cross with four oak leaves.
   The French made him a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor and
awarded him the Croix de Guerre with three palms.
   Campbell spoke modestly about his accomplishments.
   ``Because I was the first American to shoot down some planes,
they gave me more medals than they should have,'' he said in a 1985
interview.
   He retired in 1963 from Panagra, the airline formed by W.R.
Grace Co. and Pan American World Airways to serve Latin America, as
a vice president and general manager of the company.
   Campbell is survived by his wife, Virginia Pope Campbell, two
daughters, four sons, 12 grandchildren and three
great-grandchildren.
   Services will be private.

   ``I thought I was still asleep and dreaming,'' Jerome I.
Friedman, one of two Americans who won the Nobel Prize in physics,
said today after hearing the news that he had been honored by the
Swedish Academy of Sciences.
   Friedman and Henry W. Kendall won the prize with a third
researcher, Canadian Richard E. Taylor, for work in the late 1960s
that showed protons and neutrons, once thought to be fundamental
particles, were made up of smaller components called quarks.
   American Elias James Corey of Harvard University won the prize
in chemistry for research that simplified the production of
plastics and other artificial fibers, paints and dyes, pesticides
and drugs. Corey, 62, has synthesized about 100 important drugs and
other natural products, the academy said.
   Corey said he was walking into the Harvard chemistry building
today when a graduate student told him he had won.
   ``This is a statistically improbable event. There are so many
scientists who are so deserving,'' he said.
   He said that for years people had said he was nominated, ``but I
have maintained solid skepticism.''
   ``My philosphy has been to try to be as logical as I can. I try
to teach my science,'' Corey said.
   About 15 students celebrated outside Corey's office with cans of
beer - they said they couldn't afford champagne.
   ``It's an overwhelming experience. I never expected it,''
Friedman said from his hotel room in Fort Worth, Texas, where he
was attending a conference.
   Friedman, 60, and Kendall, 63, are professors at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Taylor, 60, born in Medicine
Hat, Alberta, is a professor at Stanford University. Friedman lives
in Brookline, Mass., and Kendall in Sharon, Mass.
   Taylor, contacted at his Stanford, Calif., home this morning,
said he was surprised to hear he had been awarded the prize for his
work on the quarks, now believed to be the basic building blocks of
matter.
   ``One thing that's remarkable is how little you say when the
conversation starts with the secretary of the academy in Sweden,''
said Taylor, who had been asleep when he was notified about 4 a.m.
   ``It's a big deal,'' he conceded. ``On the other hand, I know a
great many people who have won the Nobel Prize. It's a great
honor.''
   The Nobelists, who will share the $700,000 physics prize,
conducted a series of experiments at Stanford between 1968 and 1972
involving the acceleration of protons in order to better examine
their structures.
   That process, Taylor said, started an even longer process where
more quarks were discovered.
   ``This was one step in the chain to forge that essential
understanding we have now of the elementary particles,'' he said.
   Taylor said he was most influenced by W.K.H. Panofsky, then
director of the Stanford Linear Acceleration Center.
   ``It was his vision and hard work that generated the accelerator
to do the experiment,'' Taylor said. ``I think of him as directly
responsible.''
   Panofsky is now director emeritus of the center, which is
operated by Stanford for the Department of Energy.
   ``It was one of the profound contributions made'' to the field,
Panofsky said when contacted at his Los Altos, Calif., home this
morning. ``And it came out differently from the way the thing was
intended. I'm very happy. That's about all I can say.''
   Panofsky said he wasn't surprised that the three won the Nobel
Prize nearly 20 years after the conclusion of their experiments.
   ``I knew it was clearly a classical achievement that changed the
way one looked at the structure of things,'' he said. ``It was
something that was clearly deserved for a long time, and it was
sooner or later, one would hope, that this would happen.''
   Friedman said curiosity led them to it.
   ``As human beings, we have great curiosity about how nature
works. ... human beings try to understand everything,'' he said.
   ``One never knows what the application of basic research will
be,'' he added. ``Knowing what the structure of matter is,
ultimately has to have some effect on how you model the entire
structure of things.''

   The army-backed caretaker government
today filed two more corruption cases against Benazir Bhutto,
intensifying the legal pressure on the ousted prime minister a week
before national elections.
   Today's action brought to six the number of cases before special
one-judge tribunals set up to try corruption charges against the
37-year-old former prime minister, her husband and key members of
her ousted government.
   Justice Mohammad Amir Malik set a hearing for Saturday to
determine whether Ms. Bhutto should stand trial.
   Some legal experts doubt that any of the cases against Ms.
Bhutto will be completed before parliamentary elections on Oct. 24.
   They say Pakistan's judicial process is slow and cumbersome and
that the courts seem reluctant to step up the process for fear that
Western countries, especially the United States, will cut off
millions of dollars in economic and military aid if Ms. Bhutto is
disqualified.
   But growing resentment over U.S. influence in this Moslem
country of 110 million people has become an election issue, and
many fear Ms. Bhutto will be disqualified just before the poll to
spite Washington.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, meanwhile, sought to dispel fears
expressed by some that the election will be canceled and martial
law imposed.
   ``The whole nation is looking forward to the holding of
peaceful, free, fair and impartial elections and the smooth
transfer of power to the popularly elected government,'' Ishaq Khan
said in a letter to top government leaders and Gen. Mirza Aslam
Beg, the army chief of staff.
   The letter was made public today by Kamal Azfar, an aide to
caretaker Prime Minister Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi.
   Ms. Bhutto was dismissed Aug. 6 by Ishaq Khan, who charged her
20-month-old government was so corrupt and so incompetent that it
could no longer function. She is challenging the decision in the
courts.
   The charges filed today allege Ms. Bhutto used hundreds of
millions of dollars in secret service funds to buy political favors
and used government and military aircraft to transport supporters
in Parliament during a no-confidence vote last year.
   She is being tried on similar charges before another special
tribunal in Lahore and one in Karachi, her hometown. If convicted,
she could be banished from politics for seven years.
   Ms. Bhutto has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing.
   At least seven former Cabinet ministers, including her
father-in-law, Hakim Ali Zardari, have been charged with corruption
before tribunals and more than 100 supporters in her Pakistan
People's Party have been arrested.
   Her husband of nearly three years, Asif Ali Zardari, also has
been arrested and jailed in the abduction of a Pakistani-born
British man in April.
   Zardari, 38 and a candidate for Parliament, was charged with
extortion and kidnapping before a special anti-terrorism tribunal.
He has been denied bail and ordered held until Tuesday, the day
before the election.
   Ms. Bhutto was allowed to visit her husband for two hours today,
their first visit since his arrest a week ago.
   Since her government's ouster, Ms. Bhutto's opponents have tried
to portray her as a traitor sympathetic to neighboring India and to
Israel and a leader of a government that plundered the national
treasury and left its financial institutions on the verge of
bankruptcy.
   But two separate opinion polls released earlier this week
suggested the effort had backfired.
   One poll indicated that a majority of Pakistanis don't believe
Ms. Bhutto is corrupt, although most are convinced her husband is.
   Another poll gives Ms. Bhutto's opponents an edge in the
election, but indicates the outcome will be determined by a large
number of undecided voters.

United States and abroad.

   Oct. 15
   Statesman Journal, Salem, Ore., on the budget:
   People with a heart will feel sorry for President Bush.
   His budget flip-flops leave his party and his country wondering
who's in charge and what to do next. But who wouldn't flip-flop
when the budget decisions to be made are the toughest of the decade
and when no one in his party, much less in Congress or the nation
knows which way to go or can get anyone to follow?
   If Bush doesn't know exactly what should be done, he has good
company. No one does, and anyone who says he has the complete
solution also may think that he is Napoleon.
   Still, someone with more influence than Bush now must mount the
podium, pick up a baton and turn confusion and discord into harmony
if the government is to survive after Oct. 19 and if the nation is
to begin to climb out of its $3 trillion hole.
   By default, that responsibility goes to the Democratic Party. As
the majority party, it must rule the country in the absence of the
president. If Bush can't corral his Republicans and force them to
accept a compromise - and he surely didn't (earlier this month) -
then the majority party must assume the leadership and take the
first steps toward balancing the budge.
   The Democrats already have made the first moves. By the time
they are through, we expect them to raise the tax on the rich and
thus restore the equity that was lost during the Reagan presidency,
when, as even a former conservative insider said, the rich got
richer and the poor got poorer.

   Enterprise-Journal, McComb, Miss., on the budget:
   President Bush's popularity rating has declined, polls show,
because of the budget troubles in Congress. Voters seem to be
blaming him rather than Congress for proposed tax increases and
spending cuts, plus the embarrassing spectacle of a weekend
shutdown in the federal establishment.
   While we think there's plenty of blame to go around, we'll
defend Bush on this one. After all, he is trying to find a way to
stanch the flood of red ink. He is pressuring Congress to rope in
the federal deficits which may sink us all. He's trying to find a
compromise by which Congress can gradually diminish these huge cash
shortfalls.
   Back home voters need to remember: Whether you are an
individual, a business, a state or the U.S. government, you can't
keep over-spending your available funds. That's what Congress has
been doing for years, at an alarming rate.
   If individual members of Congress don't have the guts to curb
the exploding debt, then President Bush must use the full force of
his executive powers to correct their ways. Bush was wrong when he
pledged no new taxes. He is right now as he tries to forge a
workable budget compromise that will satisfy budget-busters of both
parties. He must keep it up until this budget problem, in brought
under control.
   The trouble in Congress is, too many, congressmen are scared of
special interests - the old people, the farmers, the poor people,
the wealthy, arms industry.
   For too long Congress has refused to cut spending. For too long
President Reagan, then President Bush pretended a tax increase was
not needed. For too long, the voters haven't really cared about or
comprehended issues which concern hundreds of billions of dollars
in the federal debt.
   If we want goodies from the federal government, we have to pay
for them through taxes. If we don't want to pay the taxes, we're
going to have to give up some of the costly programs we have
enjoyed. Our government cannot go on forever spending and
borrowing.

   Oct. 11
   Phiaadelphia Daily News on the budget:
   We hold these truths to be self-evident:
   -Truth No. 1 - Ronald Reagan pledged to lower taxes, and
Congress went along. The nation's tax structure lost what little
progressivity it once had, and the nation's debt exploded.
   Our tax structure must be more progressive. The rich should have
to pay more than they do.
   -Truth No. 2 - Even if tax rates for the rich were 100 percent,
the middle class will get hit - hard. That's where the money is.
Without pain for the middle class, the budget-balancing act is
phony. ...
   -Truth No. 3 - You don't ``cut'' the Medicare budget by raising
the share of costs the elderly pay. All you do is shift the burden
from government to people. ...
   -Truth No. 4 - Slash all pork-barrel programs. It doesn't matter
whether it's a dam or farm subsidies for corpocrats pretending to
be farmers. Or defense.
   -Truth No. 5 - Don't touch welfare programs for the poor until
you trim tax subsidies for the rest of us, like homeowner's and
property tax deductions and the exclusion of employer-paid health
insurance from income taxes. ...
   Like you, we are fed up with excuses from our elected officials
in Washington ... about how tough it is to balance budgets.
   If they can't get the job done, it's time to start electing
people who will. And that's another truth.

   Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal on the budget:
   The hard-fought budget compromise scuttled by the House of
Representatives has been replaced by a much more tenuous agreement,
with details to be worked out later. Smoke and mirrors gain new
life in Washington's half-hearted skirmishing with the federal
budget.
   President Bush ... declared interim victory and signed
legislation necessary to reactivate the federal government
following the ... Columbus Day hiatus, but the president - and
Congress - stared the deficit monster straight in the eyes, and
blinked.
   So, we have yet another deadline to complete the details of the
new agreement - details that eluded Congress for five months until
its leaders reached the compromise with Bush that was rejected by
the rank and file. The honorable senators and representatives have
shown themselves adept at posturing but failures at governing
responsibly.

   Bridgeton (N.J.) Evening News on the national oil reserve:
   We believe President Bush made an error when he ordered five
million gallons of oil taken from the national reserve.
   American oil refiners are selling fuel abroad to take advantage
of the higher prices available in Europe than at home. That,
however, also drives prices up at home.
   Use of the oil reserves as a price control measure can be a
temporary one only and for a very brief time.
   Opening the oil reserve now delays having to adopt (oil
conservation measures) but it may make them more painful when they
must be imposed.
   Carefully planned controls and institutions of conservation
measures during the crisis seems to be the way to go.

   Tucson (Ariz.) Citizen on paying autoworkers who are laid off:
   Imagine how $6 billion could be used to build better domestic
autos, extend gas mileage, improve safety and retool plants to
compete better against imports.
   Instead, U.S. automakers will spend that much on a fund to keep
paying autoworkers who get laid off.
   Under terms of a new contract with the United Auto Workers,
General Motors has agreed to pay $4 billion and Ford has agreed to
pay $1.5 billion. Chrysler insists it can't afford anything, but
the UAW will probably get another half-billion.
   Not even government workers are guaranteed a paycheck if there
is no demand for the service or product they provide.
   But the UAW's tenure for autoworkers could be a big competitive
disadvantage that could cut shrinking domestic auto sales and close
plants - so laid-off workers can be paid for doing nothing.

   Foster's Daily Democrat, Dover, N.H., on White House Chief of
Staff John Sununu:
   When John Sununu was tapped for what might be the second most
powerful position in our nation's government, Washington insiders
were quick to establish a lottery as to how long he would last. ...
   How long would it be before the brilliant, but something less
than modest Sununu would fall under the knives and axes of those
who inhabited those caves for years and decades before him? ...
   No one expected the relationship between Sununu and some of the
veteran members of Congress - Republicans, as well as Democrats -
to be a love feast. ...
   The budget-deficit reduction dispute was made to order for ...
Sununu's talents. He was able to go to Capitol Hill as the
president's pit bull, take a few bites out of a few legs and return
to the White House with a grin.

   The Post-Crescent, Appleton-Neenah-Menasha, Wis., on election
year politics:
   In search of a wise law, we have come upon this: Forbid Congress
from enacting laws during election years - or at least, say, during
the last two or three months before the election.
   Chomping at the bit and galloping toward the stable, the House
of Representatives approved ``anti-crime'' legislation ... that
would:
   - Expand the death penalty by about 30 crimes - leading Rep.
Dave Obey, D-Wis., to despair in sarcasm: ``Would it be possible to
bring the guillotines directly to the House floor?''
   - Deny a lawyer for an indigent death-row inmate who petitions
for a writ of habeas corpus. This clause may not survive a
constitutional challenge, but any such reversal wouldn't take
effect, of course, until well after the Nov. 6 elections.
   To the House's credit, it approved a codicil in the bill that
would allow defendants to challenge their death sentences by
alleging racial discrimination. Sad to say, President Bush has
threatened to veto the entire measure in order to remove that
``Racial Justice Act.'' We wouldn't want to allow racial justice,
would we, Mr. President?
   None of this would be happening, of course, if this weren't an
election year and if all 435 members of the House weren't up for
re-election. Such goes the dispensation of justice in the United
States ... and the lawmaking without which justice could not be
dispensed.

   The last group of communist
guerrillas in Sarawak state signed a peace accord Wednesday and
laid down their arms, the national news agency Bernama reported.
   Some of the 51 guerrillas brought their children, including a
month-old infant, to the ceremony in Kuching, 540 miles southeast
of Kuala Lumpur, Bernama reported.
   Guerrilla leaders Ang Chu Ting and Wong Lian Kui and Sarawak
State Secretary Bujang Mohamed Nor and other government officials
signed the agreement, the agency said.
   The North Kalimantan Communist Party operated in Sarawak state,
on Borneo Island, for 30 years. A first group of 569 guerrillas
made peace in 1973. Last December, 1,100 more communist guerrillas
laid down their arms.
   Government officials said the guerrillas agreed to stop fighting
because the people no longer support them. The officials said the
collapse of communism in Europe may have disheartened the
guerrillas.

   Defense lawyers in the obscenity
trial of the rap group 2 Live Crew dropped their motion today to
have the audiotape of the group's concert excluded from the trial.
   The move meant jurors will have to try to understand sexually
explicit lyrics on the murky tape of the 45-minute concert.
   The band's attorney also asked for a mistrial this morning when
one witness mentioned the concert for people of all ages that was
held just before the adults-only Hollywood concert that got the
band in trouble.
   Both sides had agreed before the trial not to refer to the
band's toned-down concert that preceded the adults-only version.
Broward County Judge June Johnson said she would reserve judgment
on that issue.
   On Tuesday, Johnson ruled that jurors cannot have transcripts of
the raucous adults-only concert last June that prompted the
rappers' arrest and set up a legal test of the limits of free
speech.
   She also closed the trial to observers under age 18, to the
disappointment of some fans. Sheriff's deputies are under orders to
check IDs at the courtroom door.
   ``I listen to 2 Live Crew in the car and at home but now they
say I can't listen to it in the courtroom,'' 13-year-old Lisette
Lopez said after she and four friends were told to leave.
   In San Antonio, a judge rejected attempts to dismiss an
obscenity charge against a record store owner who sold 2 Live
Crew's ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' album.
   County Court-at-Law Judge Tony Jimenez balked at defense claims
Tuesday that David Risher, owner of Hogwild Records and Tapes, was
singled out for prosecution. Risher's trial is set for December.
   2 Live Crew leader Luther Campbell and rappers Mark ``Brother
Marquis'' Ross and Chris ``Kid Ice'' Wongwon are charged with
obscenity for a June 10 concert at a Hollywood, Fla., nightclub.
They could get up to a year in prison and $1,000 in fines.
   The rappers' arrests came four days after a federal judge
pronounced the group's album ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' obscene.
The album includes references to oral and anal sex and sexual
violence against women.
   The concert tape contains more than explicit, violent sex,
prosecutor Leslie Robson said in opening arguments Tuesday.
   She said Campbell and other band members can be heard profanely
denouncing Sheriff Nick Navarro, who ordered their arrest, and Gov.
Bob Martinez, who called for a crackdown on their music.
   Also, Campbell pressed the head of a woman toward his crotch,
and rapper Ross exposed the breast of a young woman dancing on the
stage, the prosecutor said.
   ``He knew there was something wrong,'' Robson said. ``That there
was a problem, that there was a controversy, that there was
something wrong with that material that would open him up to some
kind of liability.''
   Defense attorney Bruce Rogow warned jurors that the lyrics might
offend them but said that they must disregard their feelings in
judging whether the words meet the legal definition of obscenity.
   ``This is not about offending people. ... This is about a legal
test,'' Rogow said. ``This is political speech. Protected speech.''
   Later Tuesday, Rogow asked that the tapes be excluded from the
trial, claiming prosecutors tampered with evidence when they had
technicians try to reduce the static on the tape. The judge said
she would rule today.
   Earlier this month, an all-white jury convicted a black record
store owner of obscenity for selling ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be.''
   The band and some free-speech advocates contend the prosecution
is rooted in whites' misunderstanding of black culture or in
animosity toward young blacks.
   The six-member jury at the rap group's trial includes one black,
a retired psychology professor who has questioned the validity of
obscenity laws and a 24-year-old office worker with a music degree.
   Obscenity cases are argued on a U.S. Supreme Court test that
holds material is obscene if the average person, applying community
standards, finds it is designed to stir sexual arousal, depicts sex
in a patently offensive way and lacks literary, artistic, political
or scientific value.

<DATELINE>DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three British men escaped overland
from Iraq to Saudi Arabia, Western diplomatic sources said today.
   The men took a lengthy route across the desert and arrived near
the Saudi town of Arar late Monday, said the sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   No immediate details were available on how the men evaded Iraqi
patrols and crossed the border.
   One diplomat said the men did not want to talk to reporters and
would be flown to Britain late today or early Thursday. Their
identities were not disclosed.
   The diplomats said they did not want to specify the route taken
in order to avoid cutting off the possible escape of others.
   The Britons are in their 20s or 30s, and have families living in
England.
   Earlier this month, three Britons and two Frenchmen escaped Iraq
by sea. The group, who were rescued off the Persian Gulf coastal
city of Khafji Oct. 3, had spent 25 hours in a small boat. They
left from the Iraqi port of Basra, where they had been employed at
an oil installation.
   Thousands of Westerners remain trapped in occupied Kuwait and
Iraq, either in hiding or detained by the government of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein. Saddam's troops invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Hundreds of Western hostages are being used as human shields at
Iraqi military and other strategic installations to deter attack by
the U.S.-led multinational force deployed against Iraq in the gulf
and Saudi Arabia.

   Bush, campaigning Tuesday night in Glen Ellyn, Ill., said that
if the House bill reaches his desk, ``I will veto it because it
raises the income taxes of the working men and women in this
country, and I am not going to do that.''
   Democratic Sens. David Boren of Oklahoma and Sam Nunn of Georgia
said they would try to amend the Senate measure to raise income tax
rates on the wealthy - as in the House bill - reduce taxes on
investment profits and rejuvenate tax-free savings accounts.
   Once the Senate passes a bill, top tax-writers from the two
houses must work out a compromise version that will require
approval by both chambers.

   Amnesty International on Thursday called on the
Central African Republic to charge or release more than 30
government opponents detained without trial.
   The detainees included Gen. Francois Bozize, a former government
minister who leads the opposition People's Movement for the
Reconstruction of the Central African Republic. They also included
Abel Goumba, leader of the opposition Obangui Patriotic Front-Labor
Party, Amnesty International said.
   The government has denied rumors that Bozize died in custody.
   Bozize and 11 others have been held without trial for more tha
a year after being forcibly repatriated from Benin. They were
allegedly connected with a coup attempt in March 1982, the human
rights group said in its report.
   Officials in Benin arrested the men in the capital of Cotonou on
July 24, 1989, and handed them over to Central African Republic
authorities the following month, said the report, published
Thursday.
   The repatriation appears to have taken place ``without any
formal extradition procedures being followed,'' it said.
   Amnesty International said the government initially said the men
were wanted in connection with the coup attempt, but later alleged
they had planned to sabotage fuel and electric installations and
carry out assassinations.
   They are being held in military custody without access to
lawyers or family, and some have reportedly been beaten and
ill-treated, the report said.
   Bozize's younger brother, Honorat Ouilebona Cocksiss, also has
been held since his arrest Dec. 29, 1989. Michel Ngouni, an air
force pilot also related to Bozize, has been held since November
1989.
   Goumba was arrested in September with 19 others, including
several former government ministers. The group was detained after
meeting, ``apparently to plan a pro-democracy demonstration,'' the
report said.
   The army chief, Gen. Andre Kolingba, took control of the Central
African Republic in a bloodless coup on Sept. 1, 1981.
   Under the Constitution adopted by a 1986 referendum, the only
legal political party is Kolingba's Rassemblement Democratique
Centrafricain.

<HEAD>Andrus A Strong Favorite Despite Abortion Bill Veto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB FICK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abortion foes marked Democratic Gov. Cecil
Andrus for defeat last March after he vetoed what would have been
the nation's strictest state abortion law.
   Seven months later, Andrus is the odds-on favorite to win an
unprecedented fourth term and the wrath over his veto has all but
evaporated. The Republican nominee, Roger Fairchild, has been
unable to attract support for his anti-establishment campaign.
   Still, the 59-year-old Andrus is running as hard as ever in what
he says will be his last political campaign.
   ``I'm going to be taking nothing for granted,'' the governor
said as he made his way through a 100-city campaign tour.
   Andrus is driven by his slim 3,600-vote victory in 1986. He also
wants a big win to help boost the prospects of Democrats running
for attorney general, treasurer and the state legislature.
   Andrus said he opposes abortion but vetoed the legislation last
March because it was too strict in cases of rape and incest and too
liberal in cases of severe fetal deformity. His explanation appears
to have satisfied most voters.
   Fairchild, a former state Senate majority leader, began the
campaign declaring that he would have signed the anti-abortion bill
``in a baby's heartbeat.'' But he virtually stopped attacking
Andrus on the issue after it didn't get much response.
   There has been little evidence of activity by anti-abortion
activists. A few small demonstrations at Andrus appearances across
the state have been little more than annoyances.
   Interest also has faded from an earlier controversy over a stint
by Andrus' wife as a high-paid corporate director. In addition, the
child sex abuse trial of Kermit Kiebert, an Andrus political ally
and state transportation director, ended in acquittal.
   Andrus has shrugged off charges from Fairchild of deceit,
financial gain from public service and isolation from the people.
He focuses on the state's economic resurgence and other successes
since 1987.
   ``I made some promises four years ago about schools and jobs and
protection of children and the quality of life,'' Andrus said.
``We've kept those promises. I think the ship of state is on a
pretty steady course.''
   Since Andrus took office, more than 30,000 more people have
found jobs, state aid to public schools is up 43 percent and the
state has had three straight multimillion-dollar budget surpluses.
   Andrus said Fairchild's campaign for reforms that would bar
corporate and out-of-state political contributions was spurred by
``disillusionment, anger and downright desperation.''
   Fairchild, 37, hasn't let up even though he is short on money
and believes the Republican Party has abandoned him. The party that
gave its 1986 nominee $25,000 has dropped just $500 into
Fairchild's treasury.
   He has generated only pocket change compared to the $1 million
campaign warchest Andrus has amassed.
   ``It's kind of intimidating to go up against him,'' Fairchild
said. ``This guy was governor when I was in high school. ... Hell,
I voted for Cecil Andrus in 1974.''
   But Fairchild insists Andrus has changed since then.
   ``Cecil Andrus was a different guy in 1974,'' Fairchild said.
``He hadn't ost his roots. He was still a common man. He was a
grass-roots Democrat.''
   Fairchild said people now see Andrus as ``just a typical
politician, standing there taking credit for things going well. In
a year that the public has finally had its fill of politicians,
Cecil Andrus is the quintessential politician.''
   Andrus resigned midway through his second term to become
President Carter's interior secretary. He returned to Idaho in 1981
to run a private consulting firm, and was elected governor again in
1986.
   Fairchild invested $90,000 of his own money to win a three-way
primary in which he overcame charges from his ex-wife that he used
drugs and beat her and her children.
   Fairchild admits he was an indiscreet young man who would ``drag
race, drink beer, smoke pot and shoot mailboxes.'' But he says he
has grown up and ``become a family man.'' The former senator owns
an apple processing company.

<HEAD>Housing Starts Continue Eight-Month Slide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing starts skidded 0.6 percent in
September, continuing an eight-month slide that has become the
longest decline on record, the government said Wednesday. Analysts
foresee no improvement before next year.
   ``The expectation is, we will slide down gradually into the
first quarter,'' which should be the low for the cycle, said David
F. Seiders, chief economist with the National Association of Home
Builders.
   ``The basic trend ... is declining levels of new construction''
through the first quarter, agreed Richard Peach, deputy chief
economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association.
   The Commerce Department said starts of new homes and apartments
fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.14 million units on
top of a 1 percent drop in August.
   It was the first time starts had fallen for eight straight
months since the department began recording them in 1959. And the
September level was the lowest since construction fell to 1.05
million units in August 1982 during the last recession.
   Seiders said the Home Builders are forecasting starts to total
just 1.04 million this year, down from 1.38 million in 1989 and
1.49 million in 1988. Already, starts are off 10.4 percent from the
first nine months of 1989.
   Building permits, often a barometer of future construction
activity, did not suggest improvement either. They were down 4.2
percent to an annual rate of 1.01 million applications on top of a
3.0 percent drop the previous month.
   The weakness in the housing industry has resulted in the loss of
311,000 construction jobs since last February, Seiders said.
Construction unemployment totaled 11.8 percent in September alone,
when another 20,000 jobs were lost, he added.
   Single-family construction rose 4.2 percent to an annual rate of
877,000 units last month, the first advance in six months. But
Peach noted that single-family starts in the third quarter declined
3.5 percent to 864,000 units from the April-May period.
   And multi-family starts plunged 14.3 percent to 258,000 units at
an annual rate. They had gained 8.3 percent in August, the first
advance since last April.
   Part of the problem with apartment construction, Peach said, is
the pileup of starts earlier this year as builders attempted to
beat a deadline for expensive new regulations designed to make
apartments more accessible to the handicapped.
   Other problems for both single- and multi-family construction,
Peach added, included high interest rates and limited sources of
financing following the savings and loan crisis.
   Starts dropped 11 percent, to an annual rate of 105,000 units,
in the Northeast and 4.4 percent, to 328,000 units, in the West.
   However, starts rose 3.3 percent, to 249,000 units, in the
Midwest and 3 percent, to 453,000 units, in the South.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a comparison of Soviet economic plans, one proposed by
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the other backed by
Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin. The Soviet legislature is
expected to pass the Gorbachev plan, perhaps as early as Saturday,
and the Russian legislature already has passed the more radical
approach advocated by Yeltsin.
   ---
   PRICES&equals;
   GORBACHEV PLAN - One-third of all prices would be controlled by
central authorities, instead of nearly all as at present. The 15
Soviet republics will have the right to raise prices for certain
goods in accordance with local conditions and freeze prices if they
rise out of control. By 1992, only prices of staples such as bread,
meat and dairy products will still be fixed. Welfare payments would
be indexed to price increases.
   YELTSIN PLAN - The market, rather than administrative decree,
would determine prices on many goods. There would be gradual
increases in wholesale prices of energy. Prices would be frozen on
100 to 150 basic goods and services for the entire transition
period. After that, the prices of 70 percent to 80 percent of goods
would be free floating. Some rationing is not ruled out and some
social assistance will be provided.
   ---
   PRIVATIZATION OF BUSINESSES AND PROPERTY&equals;
   GORBACHEV PLAN - Privatization of small businesses. The plan
drops reference to widescale ownership of private property.
Gorbachev separately has called for a referendum on
decollectivization of agricultural land.
   YELTSIN PLAN - Would end state control over businesses and
property, with the private sector prevailing in most industries and
private citizens, not agencies, as property holders. Some property
would be sold at low or symbolic cost to labor collectives. Leasing
might be possible, as would be private family property, but the
republics would determine some forms of ownership.
   ---
   BUDGET, FINANCING&equals;
   GORBACHEV PLAN - Federal budget would be financed through
federal taxes. Republics and localities would also have the right
to levy taxes. A central bank would be created to control money
supply and credit, and the ruble would be the only legal tender
throughout the country.
   YELTSIN PLAN: Strict control on state spending, reform of the
banking system. Russia would issue its own currency.
   ---
   CENTRAL CONTROL&equals;
   GORBACHEV PLAN - Central government to retain control of
defense, energy production, nuclear power, highway and rail
systems, space exploration, maritime affairs. Republics would
control their own resources, although details apparently would be
left to a proposed ``inter-republic economic committee,'' with as
yet undefined enforcement powers.
   YELTSIN PLAN - Economic union would be on a voluntary basis;
central government would control most national security affairs,
although not all foreign relations. Republics largely would control
their own energy resources.

   Police arrested a labor union leader and
seven other opposition activists Wednesday and charged them with
holding an illegal private meeting.
   Frederick Chiluba of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions and
seven members of the Movement For Multiparty Democracy were charged
with unlawful assembly in connection with a meeting Tuesday in
Choma, 185 miles southwest of Lusaka, police said.
   Police said the eight men were released on bail.
   Chiluba, vice chairman of the pro-democracy movement campaigning
for an end to 17 years of one-party rule, issued a statement urging
supporters not to hold public meetings until the constitution is
amended.
   President Kenneth Kaunda cleared the way in September for
constitutional amendments allowing for parliamentary and
presidential elections in 1991. The pro-democracy movement was
formed after food riots and anti-government demonstrations in June
that killed at least 26 people.

   Prosecutors have dismissed a manslaughter
charge against a man whose 6-year-old son was not wearing a seat
belt when he was killed in a traffic accident.
   ``The charges were dropped in the interest of justice,'' Sandi
Gibbons, spokeswoman for the district attorney, said Tuesday.
``It's a very close call.''
   Walter G. Sylvia Jr. was driving his son, Michael, to school on
Aug. 8 when the car overturned. The youngster was thrown from the
vehicle and died of head injuries.
   A 1986 law requires children in vehicles to be secured with seat
belts or belted-in car seats.
   Sylvia, 49, said he was cut off by another motorist, but
investigators said he was driving too fast.
   Deputy District Attorney Pamela Davis-Springer said Monday she
felt her decision to file the manslaughter charge was justified.
Sylvia could have been sentenced to one year in jail if convicted
of manslaughter.
   ``It made parents more aware,'' she said. ``If one parent thinks
twice about not seat-belting their child, it saved some lives and
made them think.''
   Sylvia said Ms. Davis-Springer unfairly singled him out for
prosecution.
   ``I've been through hell from that lady DA,'' Sylvia said
Monday. ``That lady should be reprimanded severely so no other
father has to go through this. I think she looked at me ... and
said, `Let's use him.' ''
   Sylvia, who's divorced from his late son's mother, had recently
won custody of Michael.
   Jackie DiNielli, Sylvia's ex-sister-in-law, said her family was
stunned to learn that prosecutors had dropped the manslaughter
charge.
   ``It's like they're condoning a killer,'' Ms. DiNielli said.
``I'm really upset about it and my family's really upset about it.
He broke the law and they're letting him off.''
   Prosecutors said they will proceed with two other charges
against Sylvia - driving with a suspended license and violation of
the state's seat belt law.
   Driving ith a suspended license is punishable by up to six
months in jail and a $1,000 fine, Davis-Springer said. The court
determines the fine for violating the seat-belt law.

   The European Community on Wednesday
granted $7.7 million in emergency aid to care for more than 100,000
orphans in Romania.
   The aid will be used to renovate the country's orphanages and to
buy heating fuel and medical equipment, the community's executive
commission said in a statement.
   The plight of Romania's estimated 100,000 to 130,000 orphans has
been a focus of international concern since the fall of Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu revealed the effects of the government's
brutal policies.
   Visitors to Romanian orphanages have described crumbling
buildings, lack of heating fuel and high rates of malnutrition and
disease.
   More than half of the $7.7 million will be given to the Romanian
government, with the remainder going to four non-governmental
agencies now running some of the orphanages, the Commission said.
   It added the emergency grant will be integrated into a larger
aid package the EC intends to send Romania in 1991.
   ``The commission wants to act as quickly as possible,'' EC
spokesman Nico Wegter said of the emergency aid.
   Wegter said an EC delegation went to Romania on Wednesday to see
what long-term medical assistance is needed.

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, on a mission to Moscow to discuss
the Persian Gulf crisis, met with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
today amid Soviet calls for a peaceful settlement to the dispute.
   Oil prices climbed after U.S. and exiled Kuwaiti officials ruled
out a possible compromise solution to the crisis in which Iraq
would withdraw from most of Kuwait but be permitted to keep some
key land.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass disclosed no details about
Cheney's meeting with Gorbachev and Soviet Defense Minister Dimitri
Yazov.
   Also today, Western diplomatic sources reported three British
men escaped overland from Iraq to Saudi Arabia. The three took a
long route across the desert, reaching the area of the Saudi town
of Arar late Monday, said the sources in Saudi Arabia. They spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   No immediate details were available on how the men evaded Iraqi
patrols and crossed the border. Their identities were not
disclosed, but they were said to be in their 20s or 30s.
   Three Britons and two Frenchmen escaped Iraq by sea earlier this
month, but there have been no reported overland escapes since then.
   Thousands of Westerners remain trapped in occupied Kuwait and
Iraq, either in hiding or detained by the government of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein. Saddam's troops invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Hundreds of Western hostages are being used as human shields at
Iraqi military and other strategic installations to deter attack by
the U.S.-led multinational force deployed against Iraq in the gulf
and Saudi Arabia.
   Meanwhile, Soviet Middle East expert Yevgeny Primakov was on a
trip to Europe and the United States to discuss the gulf crisis. He
arrived in Paris today for talks with French President Francois
Mitterrand.
   ``The Soviet leadership believes that if there is a smallest
chance to settle the conflict peacefully that chance should be used
to the ultimate,'' Gorbachev spokesman Vitaly Ignatenko said in
Moscow on Tuesday.
   At the United Nations, diplomats said Britain was drafting a
measure to make Iraq pay war reparations, and the United States was
seeking to have the world body oversee the resupply of Western
diplomats who have refused to quit their countries' embassies in
Kuwait City.
   The only Western holdouts are the British, Americans, Canadian
and French.
   Britain's Foreign Office said today that Iraq had withdrawn
diplomatic accreditation from eight British diplomatic personnel
evacuated from Kuwait to Baghdad. It said Iraq's ambassador had
been summoned to hear a protest against Baghdad's ``flagrant
disregard for international law.''
   Britain also told the Iraqi ambassador that British nationals
who have suffered damage or injury since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
intend to demand compensation, a Foreign Office spokesman said.
   Oil prices continued to reflect fears over the crisis, closing
just short of $39 on Tuesday, up nearly $1. The rise was attributed
in part to signs of a hardened U.S. position toward Saddam.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, a key market for oil and
oil products, the price of benchmark light sweet crude for November
delivery closed at $38.89 a barrel, up 94 cents from the Monday
closing price. Prices fell back slightly this morning, with
November crude at $38.75 in early trading today.
   Former Persian Gulf foes Iran and Iraq continued the process of
reconciliation in the wake of their eight-year war. The Tehran
Times, an English-language Iranian newspaper, said today Iran has
appointed an ambassador to Iraq.
   Although the two nations had not formally severed their ties
during the 1980-88 conflict, embassies were closed and diplomats
withdrawn. On Sunday, Iran and Iraq announced they had reopened
embassies in each other's capitals.
   After Primakov's recent trip to Baghdad, Soviet media reported
over the weekend that Iraq might be prepared to pull out from most
of Kuwait in exchange for keeping the Kuwaiti section of the
Rumailah oil field that straddles the Iraq-Kuwait border as well as
several strategic islands in the gulf.
   Primakov was to travel to Washington for a meeting with Bush on
Thursday.
   Kuwaitis fleeing into Saudi Arabia said the Iraqis were setting
up fences that separate most of Kuwait from the Rumailah field,
which Saddam accused the Kuwaitis of overexploiting before he
invaded and annexed their country.
   In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III rejected
any concession to Baghdad, saying the United States will settle for
nothing less than a complete Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
   ``We are unwilling to engage in a search for partial
solutions,'' he said.
   Baker said Saddam evidently was interested ``in a negotiated
arrangement that would enable him to claim benefits from his
unprovoked aggression against a small neighbor.''
   A U.N.-ordered embargo on trade with Iraq, enforced by a
multinational flotilla, has caused shortages in Iraq but has so far
failed to force Saddam to back down. The Pentagon says about
430,000 Iraqi troops are in Kuwait, and have been building roads
and fortifications.

<TEXT>
   A hunter was found innocent today of
manslaughter charges in the death of a woman he shot and killed
when he mistook her for a deer two years ago.
   A Penobscot County Superior Court jury found Donald Rogerson
innocent after about nine hours of deliberations.
   Rogerson, a 47-year-old supermarket produce manager, was charged
in the Nov. 15, 1988, death of Karen Wood, a 37-year-old mother of
twin 1-year-old girls. Mrs. Wood was shot once in the chest while
she stood about 130 feet behind her home in Hermon, a Bangor
suburb.
   Members of Rogerson's family jumped up and hugged each other
after the jury's verdict was read.
   Mrs. Wood's husband, Kevin, hung his head and left the courtroom
in silence.
   ``I'm very overwhelmed at this time,'' Rogerson said as he
walked out of the courthouse. ``I hope and pray the Lord will give
Mr. Wood the strength He has given me through this whole ordeal.''
   Kevin Wood, who now lives in Bettendorf, Iowa, returned to Maine
to watch the trial. He had predicted that Rogerson would be
acquitted.
   Wood has criticized the way Maine authorities handled the case
and said today he was ``stunned'' by the verdict.
   ``I'm shocked that at least one of the 12 jury members couldn't,
after hearing all of the evidence, come to the conclusion that
Donald Rogerson was guilty,'' Wood said.
   ``I think more than Donald Rogerson was on trial here. I think
the community standards of morality and integrity also were being
tested. I feel sorry for the community of Bangor because I feel
that they failed that test.''
   Jurors refused to comment as they left the courthouse.
   The case attracted national attention and had set off an
emotional debate in Maine over hunting safety.
   Mrs. Wood's husband, Kevin, who now lives in Bettendorf, Iowa,
had predicted that Rogerson would be cleared. He attended the trial
and has criticized the way Maine authorities handled the case.
   Rogerson was first arrested and charged with manslaughter the
evening of the shooting, but a grand jury concluded in December
1988 that his actions were neither criminally negligent nor
criminally reckless.
   But the state attorney general's office reopened the case in
1989 after a Portland television station reported that a nephew of
Rogerson's defense lawyer had served on the grand jury.
   Rogerson was indicted by a second grand jury in December 1989.
   The Superior Court jury weighed the evidence for seven hours
Tuesday before breaking for the night without reaching a verdict.
The panel deliberated about two hours this morning before clearing
Rogerson of the charge.
   The father of three children, Rogerson would have faced up to 20
years in prison if convicted.
   In his testimony Tuesday, Rogerson described the area where he
was hunting as ``well traveled'' by deer.
   ``I thought I heard the noise of an animal,'' Rogerson said. ``I
heard a snap. I looked up and there was a buck deer in front of me.
Then, I saw the brown of the deer in my scope.''
   He said he fired one shot, then saw ``two white flags'' - the
white underside of a deer's tail - and fired another shot. He said
he ran toward the object expecting to find a deer.
   ``Almost simultaneously, I saw the house, I saw the mittens and
I saw her,'' Rogerson said.
   Mrs. Wood was wearing white mittens when she was shot.
   The prosecution had rested its case Monday after presenting
three days of testimony.
   The state presented 12 witnesses and introduced 26 pieces of
evidence, including spent shell casings, the sweatshirt and mittens
Mrs. Wood was wearing when she was killed and Rogerson's hunting
rifle.
   Prosecutors had argued that Rogerson acted negligently or
recklessly when he killed Mrs. Wood. Rogerson was about 180 feet
from Mrs. Wood when he fired.
   In closing arguments Tuesday, Rogerson's laywer, Lewis Vafiades,
said no one could prove that Rogerson didn't see a deer before
firing his rifle.
   The district game warden and other investigators testified that
they couldn't find any deer tracks in the area where Rogerson
fired, but Vafiades said, ``They're just as human as you or I, and
they make mistakes.''
   Prosecutor Jeff Hjelm said Rogerson ``should have known better''

   ``Anything less than absolute certainty about the target grossly
violates the rules,'' Hjelm said. ``Guns are designed to kill, so
the dangers and risks of hunting could not be higher. The stakes
are literally life and death.''

   Guerrillas attacked a crowd attending
a music festival and killed 11 people, state radio reported
Wednesday.
   Radio Mozambique said the attack occurred in Cheringoma, 125
miles north of the eastern seaport of Beira. The report did not
give a date for the attack.
   Mozambican rebels, known by their Portuguese acronym RENAMO,
have been fighting the leftist government since 1977. President
Joachim Chissano has been trying to revive peace talks with the
rebels, but RENAMO refuses to take part until thousands of
Zimbabwean soldiers supporting Chissano are withdrawn from

   The government is considering barring parole for
organized crime figures and heavy penalties for those who lead
children into crime, newspapers reported Wednesday.
   The Cabinet met in special session Tuesday night to discuss a
crackdown on organized crime but did not immediately announce its
decisions.
   Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti presented statistics on the
growth of activity by the Sicilian Mafia and crime syndicates in
Naples and southern Calabria. The report said the number of crimes
attributed to the mobs has tripled over the past decade, rising
from 740,000 in 1980 to more than 2 million last year.
   Andreotti's report said around 15,000 people have direct links
with the Mafia, the Camorra in Naples and the 'ndrangheta in
Calabria.
   A recent wave of murders, including the assassination of an
anti-Mafia judge in Sicily, prompted President Francesco Cossiga to
declare that parts of the country appear to have come under control
of organized crime.

<HEAD>Air Force Academy Cadets Implicated in Dormitory Sex Show</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AIR FORCE ACADEMY, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Air Force Academy cadets -
male and female - who had sex in an academy dormitory are facing
dismissal, as are six others who secretly watched, officials said.
   The Aug. 29 incident apparently was plotted by six male cadets
to help a friend break off a relationship with the female cadet,
Air Force Capt. Rick Sanford of the academy's public relations
office said today.
   Six male cadets hid inside the darkened room to watch their
friend have sex with the woman, who was unaware that anyone else
was in the room, Col. Mike Wallace, academy director of public
affairs, said Tuesday.
   Air Force policy prohibits sexual activity in academy dorms, and
offenders usually are expelled, Wallace said. Male and female
cadets are allowed to study together until 11 p.m. in each other's
rooms.
   The female cadet, a sophomore, learned that others had been in
the room through rumors that surfaced in late September.
   Officials learned of the incident when the female was treated at
the academy hospital Sept. 28 for an apparent overdose of a pain
reliever. She told doctors and academy officials she was distraught
over the incident and took the pills because of severe headaches,
Wallace said.
   She told officials that she wasn't trying to kill herself, and
hospital personnel agreed. But the dose was ``life-threatening,''
and her stomach had to be pumped, Wallace said.
   The woman will face a disciplinary board when she returns to the
academy, Wallace said. She is hospitalized because of an abscessed
larynx that was scratched during the stomach pumping.
   The man who participated in the sex submitted his resignation,
Wallace said, and disciplinary boards recommended dismissal for the
other six men. Four of them have submitted resignations, and two
are awaiting hearings before high-ranking officers.
   The Pentagon must approve the resignations and dismissals.
   Wallace said several cadets each year are kicked out for
engaging in sex in the dorms. Last year, three incidents were
reported and four cadets were dismissed, he said.

<HEAD>Man Steals Two Police Employees' Trucks in One Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENA PARK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have some incentive to find a
man who stole two red pickup trucks in one day: both trucks
belonged to police department employees.
   ``I guess the guy had it in for police and red pickups,'' Sgt.
Terry Branum said of the Monday thefts.
   The thief remained at large Wednesday, police said.
   The first theft was thwarted by reserve Officer Mike Lovchik,
who walked out of a Cerritos medical center to see his red 1984
Toyota pickup being backed out of a parking space.
   Lovchik jumped into the truck bed as the thief pulled away and
``started pounding on the window and yelling a few choice words at
the guy,'' Branum said.
   The thief drove onto the eastbound Riverside freeway, ``driving
like a maniac'' at speeds of up to 90 mph, Branum said.
   ``At one point they passed an L.A. county sheriff's car and
Lovchik tries to flag them down, but they don't see him,'' Branum
said.
   When the thief exited the freeway, Lovchik negotiated his
truck's release.
   ``He showed the suspect his badge and told him all he wanted was
his truck and he would let him get away,'' Branum said. ``Of
course, that's not what he had in mind.''
   The thief, however, had other ideas. He bailed out of the truck
in a Buena Park cul de sac, punching the accelerator pedal as he
jumped, Branum said.
   Lovchik waited for his truck to slow down to try to stop it, but
he was unable to prevent it from crashing into a street light. It
received moderate damage.
   The thief was last seen running through an apartment complex to
a high school, where he stole another red 1984 Toyota pickup - this
one owned by a Cypress Police Department records clerk.

<HEAD>Industrial Production Up Slightly On Strength Of Auto Output</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industrial production rose 0.2 percent in
September, the government reported Wednesday, with a 7.5 percent
spurt in automobile production masking an underlying manufacturing
weakness.
   The Federal Reserve report was ``loaded by the motor vehicle
numbers, which are unsustainable,'' contended Robert G. Dederick,
chief economist for the Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
   Excluding autos, the Fed said production dropped 0.1 percent.
   At the same time, the central bank revised output figures for
July and August to show the industrial economy stronger than first
reported last summer. Production in July was boosted from flat to a
0.2 percent gain while August output was changed from a 0.2 percent
decline to a 0.1 percent advance.
   ``There were a lot of questions about whether we were still
growing in the third quarter,'' said David Jones, an economist with
Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a New York securities dealer. ``What we
had was an economy that was slipping into recession in slow
motion.''
   ``We still feel that given the sharp deterioration in consumer
and business confidence on the heels of the oil shock, the economy
will show negative growth n the fourth quarter,'' he added.
   The 7.5 percent gain in auto output, Jones said, resulted from
``aggressive rebates that tend to steal from future demand.'' He
noted that sales dropped from a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
8.2 million in the last 10 days of September, when incentives were
offered, to 6.5 million in the first 10 days of October.
   Production at manufacturing plants making both durable and
non-durable goods rose 0.2 percent in September. But the Fed said,
``apart from the sharp rise in motor vehicle assemblies,
manufacturing output dropped 0.2 percent.''
   Indeed, ``if you look at the components, the declines were
fairly widespread,'' Dederick said.
   Output of durable goods - automobiles and other big-ticket items
expected to last at least three years - increased 0.2 percent, down
slightly from a 0.3 percent gain in August.
   Manufacturing of non-durable goods also gained 0.2 percent after
slipping 0.1 percent the previous month.
   Output at mines bounced back 0.4 percent after slumping 1.7
percent in August. Utility production rose 0.9 percent after a 1.3
percent advance the previous month, due in part, analysts said, to
warm weather.
   The Fed said its industrial production index in September stood
at 110.7 percent of its 1987 base, up from 110.4 percent in August.
   The Fed also said the operating rate of the nation's factories,
mines and utilities was unchanged at 83.6 percent. The operating
rate measures not only output but also changes in productivity
levels.
   The operating rate at factories producing both durable and
non-durable goods was unchanged. The durable operating rate stood
at 82.1 percent, while the rate at plants making non-durable goods
remained at 83.7 percent.
   The operating rate at mines gained 0.4 percentage point, to 89
percent, in September, while it jumped 0.7 percentage point to 88.1
percent at utilities.

<TEXT>
   North and South Korea angrily
disagreed Wednesday over whether to recognize each others'
governments, in the latest talks on easing tensions on the divided
peninsula.
   The first session of the meeting betweeen the Korean premiers
held no surprises, with acrimonious comments and diplomatic slights
prevailing over any real progress.
   ``Can problems be solved if both sides do not discuss truth - or
if we irritate each other's nerves?'' said an angry North Korean
Premier Yon Hyong Muk, raising his voice to what witnesses said was
``a high pitch.''
   The talks, being held in North Korea's capital of Pyongyang, 105
miles north of Seoul, opened the second round of the highest-level
ks in 45 years. The first round was held in Seoul
five weeks ago.
   The premier's outburst came after his South Korean countinter-Korean
talerpart,
Kang Young-hoon, finished his opening proposal to resolve four
decades of tension and mutual distrust. Between the two capitals
lies one of the most heavily fortified and tightly sealed borders
in the world.
   Kang demanded each nation recognize the other's government. He
also warned a new era of cooperation meant Communist North Korea
had to give up its policy of confrontation and effortsto foment
revolution in South Korea, ``a policy that repudiates and isck market,

<HEAD>Negative Campaign Attacks Feature A New L-Word: Liar</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 10th graf, Former Sen, to show Tower was speaking of
Exon's reputation.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Political candidates used to accuse their
rivals of misstating the facts. Now they're bluntly calling each
other liars - and that's hardly the worst insult that attentive
voters have heard this season.
   Guilt by association is making a comeback, with the villains
ranging from Hitler and Saddam Hussein to Michael Dukakis and
Charles Keating.
   The air and airwaves reverberate with epithets such as ``slimy''
and ``boozer,'' campaign literature compares a New Mexico
gubernatorial candidate to a stale lounge act and a consultant
calls a senator a ``weenie.''
   ``Some of the gentility of the past is eroding,'' says Kathleen
Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School of Communication at the
University of Pennsylvania. ``The claims have been phrased more
diplomatically in the last four election cycles. Now you're getting
blunter language.''
   The biggest departure this year, from Jamieson's perspective, is
that candidates are using a new L-word - liar. In the past,
stand-ins or surrogates used the word but the candidates themselves
tried to project a loftier image.
   Clayton Williams, the Republican governor candidate in Texas,
scrapped the indirect approach last week and called Democrat Ann
Richards a liar to her face. He was upset about her attempts to
link him to a federal investigation into alleged drug money
laundering.
   ``I'm here to call you a liar today,'' Williams told Richards.
That was after he refused to shake her hand.
   A few days later, Jon Grunseth, the GOP governor candidate in
Minnesota, labeled Democratic incumbent Rudy Perpich ``the supreme
liar.'' That was after Perpich denied having anything to do with
allegations that Grunseth encouraged four teen-age girls to swim
nude with him at a party nine years ago.
   Intense character scrutiny has marked this year's contests, some
of it sounding like a grade-school grudge match and some of it
slightly elevated - to college level, mybe.
   Former Sen. John Tower sparked a round of insults last week
while campaigning for former Rep. Hal Daub of Nebraska, who is
running for the Senate. Tower said Daub's rival, Democratic Sen.
James Exon, had ``the reputation in Washington of being one of the
two or three biggest boozers in the Senate.''
   No one responded more colorfully than Democratic Sen. Bob
Kerrey, Exon's home-state colleague. ``Tower's behavior was
larval,'' Kerrey said in a statement that also referred to Tower's
``worm-like lies.''
   Many times this year, surrogates have stomped into territory
where candidates dared not tread.
   For example, Michigan Republican Richard Headlee said Democratic
Gov. James Blanchard's tactics have been ``as effective as the
Third Reich under Hitler.'' John Engler, the GOP candidate Headlee
was trying to help, did not agree.
   ``We don't share Dick's view on that,'' Engler's press secretary
hastily explained. ``Dick gets somewhat carried away.''
   And Republican Rep. Lynn Martin, who is trying to unseat Sen.
Paul Simon in Illinois, ended up apologizing to Simon after an
acidic news conference held by her media consultant, Roger Ailes.
   ``Simon is just being Simon which is unfortunately being
slimy,'' Ailes said.
   If that wasn't enough, he also labeled Simon a weenie.
   On another occasion, Ailes had a few things to say about
California Treasurer candidate Kathleen Brown, the sister of former
Gov. Jerry Brown.
   Ailes dubbed her Sister Moonbeam and when she complained, he
responded: ``She does not sound like a woman with all her oars in
the water. ... I think she's going to need some Prozac before it's
all over.''
   Bob Squier, Ailes' Democratic counterpart, has employed another
strategy. He has been a leader in what Jamieson calls the
distortive use of newspaper clips in TV ads.
   ``The newspapers are becoming a weapon, and not necessarily a
legitimate one,'' she said. Squier, for example, was forced to
admit wrongdoing in an ad he made for Richards in Texas.
   The ad showed a partial headline that said: ``Lawsuits Allege
Williams A `Deadbeat.''' Squier left off the last two words of the
headline that made clear where the accusations came from:
``Richards Discloses.''
   Richards has since started using two positive TV spots, also
made by Squier. But consultants in at least two other major races
found themselves on the sidelines when their candidates decided to
switch into feel-good mode.
   Democratic Senate contender Josie Heath of Colorado started an
upbeat ad campaign two weeks after trading in one agency for
another. And Republican Dave Frohnmayer, running for governor of
Oregon, fired his admakers because, he said, his image had become
too strident.
   Still, niceness is waning fast in most races. Even the genteel
Senate contest between Sen. Claiborne Pell and GOP Rep. Claudine
Schneider has succumbed to the dominant tone of the season. After
weeks of skirting the age issue, Schneider, 43, recently referred
to Pell, 71, as ``out of it.''
   Her comment was mild compared to the barb-strewn battlegrounds
in Texas, Illinois, Massachusetts and elsewhere. GOP Rep. Bill
Schuette may have been speaking for more voters and candidates than
he knew during a recent debatet in September alone,
when another 20,000 jobs were lost, he added.
   Single-family construction rose 4.2 percent to an annual rate of
877,000 units last month, the first advance in six months. But
Peach noted that single-family starts in the third quarter declined
3.5 percent to 864,000 units from the April-May period.
   And multi-family starts plunged 14.3 percent to 258,000 units at
an annual rate. They had gained 8.3 percent in August, the first
advance since last April.
   Part of the problem with apartment construction, Peach said, is
the pileup of starts earlier this year as builders attempted to
beat a deadline for expensive new regulations designed to make
apartments more accessible to the handicapped.
   Other problems for both single- and multi-family construction,
Peach added, included high interest rates and limited sources of
financing following the savings and loan crisis.
   Starts dropped 11 percent, to an annual rate of 105,000 units,
in the Northeast and 4.4 percent, to 328,000 units, in the West.
   However, starts rose 3.3 percent, to 249,000 units, in the
Midwest and 3 percent, to 453,000 units, in the South.

   The House today gave final approval, 273-154,
to a major civil rights bill designed to combat job bias, setting
the stage for a veto confrontation with President Bush.
   Bush has said he'll veto the legislation because it will force
businesses to set hiring quotas.
   Provisions in the bill range from a ban on racial harassment in
the workplace to punitive damages in the most severe discrimination
cases.
   The House passed the bill by a comfortable margin, but that
falls just short of the two-thirds needed to override presidential
veto and pass the bill into law over presidential objections.
   The Senate approved the measure Tuesday night 62-34, also short
of the needed votes to override the expected veto.
   The bill represents the civil rights movement's top goal on
Capitol Hill and would overturn six Supreme Court decisions on job
discrimination handed down last year that set off protests.

<TEXT>
   Former Senator Olavo Pires,
frontrunner in the governor's race in the remote Amazon state of
Rondonia, was slain by two men wielding machine guns, an aide said
Wednesday.
   Pires, a center-right candidate for the Brazilian Labor Party,
was killed late Tuesday as he returned to his office in downtown
Porto Velho, 2,300 miles northwest of Rio, said the aide, Carlos
Godoy.
   Acording to news accounts, Pires' driver returned fire, but the
gunmen were able to flee.
   Police refused comment on the slaying.
   Godoy accused Pires' political opponents of his death, but did
not elaborate. He said the candidate had received repeated death
threats and had recently asked for police protection.
   ``The senator was shot in the back without the protection he had
requested,'' he said. ``He knew he was condemned to death.''
   Pires finished first in an Oct. 3 election but was forced into a
runoff vote set for Nov. 25 because no candidate received the
majority needed for a first-round victory. Under Brazilian election
law, the third-place finisher in October replaces Pires on the
November ballot.
   In 1988, police investigated Pires on charges of drug
trafficking after his private pilot was arrested with 28 pounds of
cocaine.

   Two Americans and a Canadian captured
the Nobel Prize in physics Wednesday for finding nature's smallest
known particle. An American won the Nobel in chemistry for
developing simpler ways to make complex chemicals.
   Americans Jerome I. Friedman and Henry W. Kendall and Canadian
Richard E. Taylor showed that protons and neutrons, once thought to
be fundamental particles, were made up of smaller components called
quarks. Quarks are now believed to be basic building blocks of
matter.
   American Elias James Corey won the prize in chemistry for
research that simplified the production of plastics and other
artificial fibers, paints and dyes, pesticides and drugs.
   ``This is a statistically improbable event,'' Corey said of
winning the award. ``There are so many scientists who are so
deserving.''
   He found out he had won when a student congratulated him in the
hallway.
   The Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards both prizes, said
Corey's work has ``contributed to the high standards of living and
health and the longevity enjoyed ... in the Western world.''
   Each prize is worth about $700,000.
   ``Here was a repetition, although at a deeper level, of one of
the most dramatic events in the history of physics, the discovery
of the nucleus of the atom,'' the academy said of the physics
laureates' work.
   ``Their experiments showed definitively that there were smaller
nuclear particles than protons and neutrons,'' said Professor
Cecelia Jareskog of the academy.
   In the future, she said, ``we will be able to see even finer
details. Maybe there is something inside the quark.''
   Friedman, 60, of Chicago, and Kendall, 63, of Boston are
professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Taylor,
60, born in Medicine Hat, Alberta, is a professor at Stanford
University.
   The discovery was made during research begun in 1967 at MIT and
Stanford using Stanford's linear accelerator, an ``atom smasher''
that produces high-speed collisions of sub-atomic particles in an
effort to discern their properties and structure.
   Friedman, reached in Fort Worth, Texas, said he was ``very, very
overwhelmed'' at winning the Nobel.
   He said the research began with a study of protons.
   ``To our surprise, we found that the scattering of electrons
from protons behaved in a way that suggested that there were
point-like objects inside, little nuggets inside. They were later
identified ... as being compatible with there being quarks,'' he
said.
   It was the first experimental evidence that quarks existed and
confirmed earlier theories, Friedman said.
   Asked the meaning of the research, he said it contributed to the
understanding of ``how nature works.''
   He added: ``One never knows what the application of basic
research will be. Knowing what the structure of matter is,
ultimately has to have some effect on how you model the entire
structure of things.''
   Taylor, contacted at home in Stanford, Calif., said he was
surprised to learn he had won the prize. ``It's a great honor,'' he
said.
   Taylor said he was most influenced by W.K.H. Panofsky, former
director of the Stanford Linear Acceleration Center. ``It was his
vision and hard work that generated the accelerator to do the
experiment,'' he said. ``I think of him as directly responsible.''
   Kendall said of winning the Nobel: ``I think the prize means
recognition for what has been an important experiment in physics.
It was done 20 years ago, so I found it delightful and
unexpected.''
   Kendall has been chairman of the Union of Concerned Scientists
since 1973.
   Corey, 62, of Harvard University, has synthesized about 100
important drugs and other natural products, the academy said.
   Corey's method of synthesizing chemicals is called
retrosynthetic analysis. To make biological molecules in the
laboratory, he analyzes their structure and works backward to
identify simpler molecules he needs to construct them.
   ``It is one of the prerequisites of our civilization,'' the
academy said of Corey's work. The field has been rewarded with the
Nobel Prize seven times before.
   The Nobel prizes were endowed in the 1896 will of Alfred Nobel,
the inventor of dynamite. The physics and chemistry prizes were the
last awarded this year.
   This week, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev won the peace
prize and Americans Harry Markowitz, Merton Miller and William
Sharpe won the Nobel memorial prize in economics.
   Last week Mexican poet and essayist Octavio Paz won the prize in
literature and Americans Joseph E. Murray and E. Donnall Thomas won
the prize for medicine.
   The prizes will be presented Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's
death.

<HEAD>Three Britons Escape Iraq; Baker Slams Saddam</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Iraq commment on effects of
sanctions. No pickup.</NOTE>

   Three British men made a dramatic desert escape from Iraq,
diplomats reported Wednesday, and Secretary of State James A. Baker
III said Saddam Hussein ``must fail if peace is to succeed'' in the
Persian Gulf.
   The escape by the three Britons was the first reported by
Westerners since three Britons and two Frenchmen made their way out
of Iraq by sea earlier this month.
   Thousands of Westerners are being held by the Iraqi president in
Iraq and Kuwait, with some of them serving as ``human shields''
against potential attacks on key installations by the multinational
force assembled in the gulf region.
   Western diplomatic sources in Saudi Arabia, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the three Britons arrived near the
Saudi town of Arar late Monday. In order to avoid endangering
others who might try to get out the same way, they did not say how
the men evaded Iraqi patrols or provide details about their route.
   In Baghdad, Iraqi officials conceded Wednesday that global
sanctions, imposed to punish Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait, were
beginning to have an effect.
   ``There is not enough milk for the newborn babies and the
blockade has affected nourishment of expectant mothers,' Hamad
Saleh al-Rawi, president of the Iraqi Bar Association, said in a
statement released in Baghdad Wednesday.
   The government has listed milk along with rice, wheat, sugar,
cooking oil, tea, soap, detergent and beans as items in short
supply and subject to rationing.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, meanwhile, held a closed-door
meeting with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, and their
discussion reportedly touched on the 12-week-old gulf conflic.
   The talks came as Moscow was calling for redoubled efforts to
find a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
   A Soviet envoy was to travel to Washington on Thursday for a
meeting with President Bush, after talks in France and Italy on the
crisis. Soviet officials have said the envoy, Yevgeny Primakov, was
stressing Gorbachev's hopes for a peaceful settlement.
   In another development, Britain made an angry new protest to
Iraq over treatment of its diplomats. Its Foreign Office said
Wednesday that Iraq had withdrawn diplomatic accreditation from
eight British diplomats evacuated from Britain's embassy in Kuwait
to Baghdad.
   After the takeover of Kuwait, Iraq ordered all foreign missions
in the emirate to close. Most diplomats have been forced to leave
because Iraqi occupation forces cut off food, water and electricity
to their embassies.
   The only Western embassies still open are the British, American,
Canadian and French missions.
   The Foreign Office summoned Iraq's ambassador to protest what it
called a ``flagrant disregard for international law'' in
withdrawing the envoys' accreditation, it said.
   ``The decision not to accord them diplomatic status means they
are seen as ordinary British male citizens, who are not allowed to
leave,'' said a spokesman.
   U.N. officials said Wednesday that Iraq had refused permission
for a Kuwaiti flight to the conquered emirate to bring medicine for
Kuwaitis and stranded foreigners.
   Kuwait's government-in-exile had asked Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar to seek permission for the flight to land. U.N.
spokesman Francois Giuliani said the request was rebuffed Tuesday
via Iraq's mission to the U.N.
   The United Nations has taken an unprecedented series of steps
against Iraq since the Aug. 2 invasion, including the approval of a
global economic embargo.
   Baker, in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, denounced Iraqi aggression for a second day running.
   ``We cannot allow this violent way to become the wave of the
future in the Middle East,'' he told the panel. ``Saddam Hussein,
Mr. Chairman, must fail if peace is to succeed. The prospects for a
just and lasting peace ... will be shattered if he prevails.''
   A day earlier, Baker rejected any concession to Baghdad, saying
the United States will settle for nothing less than a complete
Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
   Baker told the committee that President Bush would consult with
Congress about military moves in the gulf, but resisted calls for
what he called a more ``formal mechanism.''
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said military action against Iraq
was more likely now and that Congress, which has a recess upcoming,
should come back into session to authorize a declaration of war if
one were needed.
   In Moscow, Cheney told Soviet lawmakers that U.S. and Soviet
military strategy now calls for a reduction in the forces once
arrayed against one another, and a focus on ``regional
contingencies'' such as the gulf conflict.
   U.S. and Soviet sources said the content of Cheney's closed-door
talks with Gorbachev was similar.
   Also Wednesday, the Tehran Times reported that Iran has
appointed an ambassador to Iraq. The move came three days after the
two countries announced the reopening of embassies closed during
their eight-year war.
   Saddam moved to make peace with Iran after the invasion of
Kuwait. Although the fighting had stopped two years earlier, Iraq
had thousands of troops tied up along its border with Iran and in
Iranian territory before its peace initiative.

<HEAD>Illinois Republican Apologizes For Remarks About Colleague</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illinois Rep. Henry Hyde apologized on
Wednesday for derogatory remarks he made earlier about Rep. Barney
Frank's sexuality.
   The exchange between Hyde and Frank, who is homosexual, began
when Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, berated the Republicans for
flip-flopping on taxes.
   He said he wasn't in the chamber, but read in the Congressional
Record that 10 days ago ``someone passing himself off as the
Republican leader'' urged a vote for new taxes, but Tuesday said
taxes should not be raised.
   Frank said sarcastically there must be a security problem in the
house that allowed an impostor to speak for Republican Leader
Robert Michel.
   That caused Hyde to jump to his feet to blast the Democratic
package of higher taxes and budget cuts as an attack on the middle
class.
   He said the reason Frank hadn't heard Michel was because ``he
was in the gymnasium doing whatever he does in the gymnasium and he
wasn't available.''
   The remark was a reference to unsubstantiated allegations by a
male prostitute that he had sexual relations with Frank in the
House gymnasium.
   ``I'm appalled that you would make the remarks that you made,''
Rep. Craig Washington, D-Texas, said to Hyde. ``Great minds think
about ideas, average minds think about things and small minds talk
about people.
   ``What business do you have mentioning the personal matters of
any member of Congress. What difference does it make whether
someone is in the gymnasium?''
   Minutes later, Washington went to the Republican side of the
chamber to speak directly to Hyde. Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., also
had words with the Republican.
   In moments, Hyde was on his feet apologizing to Frank.
   ``I was out of line,'' he said. ``What I said was in anger. One
should never speak in anger. It was out of line. I would like my
words physically removed from the record.''
   Frank accepted the apology.

<HEAD>Inmate Let Out to Run Marathon Keeps Going</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man serving a home detention sentence
persuaded convinced authorities to set him free temporarily so he
could run in a nonexistent anti-drug marathon.
   Then he ran, and ran, and ran.
   ``He just used it as a scam to boogie,'' said Yakima County
Sheriff Doug Blair.
   But Hector Mendoza returned and surrendered three days later.
   Mendoza, 22, told jail officials he was an organizer of a Drug
Abuse Resistance Education run from Yakima to Sunnyside on
Saturday.
   County DARE officer Deputy Jeff Gillespie said Mendoza had
contacted him suggesting such a fund-raising run several weeks ago,
but had never followed up. Gillespie said the program, which
teaches schoolchildren about drugs, carefully screens all
fund-raisers to make sure they are legitimate.
   Saturday was the second-to-last day of Mendoza's three-month
home detention sentence, but he was to begin a separate 30-day jail
term immediately afterward.
   Mendoza turned himself in at the jail Tuesday night, after
considering his options, said jail Sgt. Bill Sturm.
   ``The way he talked he was ready to leave the state. Then I
guess he changed his mind,'' Sturm said.
   ``We're not sure what we're going to do with him yet,'' Sturm
said.
   Mendoza was serving the detention sentence for driving with a
suspended license. The 30-day sentence was for unpaid traffic
fines.
   While serving home detention sentences, offenders aren't allowed
to go anywhere except work, home and places prearranged with the
court. They wear an anklet equipped with a radio transmitter that
lets monitors keep track of them.
   Mendoza wasn't supposed to take his anklet off for the race, but
he didn't have it when he turned himself in, officials said.
   Blair said jailers had had no reason to disbelieve that Mendoza
would actually be running a marathon, because he was at the end of
his home-detention sentence and had served it without any problems.

<HEAD>Conference Committee Agrees on Industry, Leaving Only Acid Rain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional negotiators reached a tentative
accord Wednesday on controlling emissions toxic industrial
chemicals, leaving them only one big step away from agreement on a
costly new clean air law.
   Still on the table was the question of how to deal with acid
rain, the last barrier to the first major overhaul of national air
pollution law in 13 years.
   Wednesday's agreement represents the first time the government
would require businesses to make dramatic reductions in the more
than 2.4 billion pounds of 189 hazardous chemicals, including many
cancer-causing agents, released yearly into the air.
   Reductions would be required not just from factories, refineries
and chemical plants, but also from smaller businesses such as dry
cleaners and furniture refinishers, and even from garbage
incinerators.
   Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., who led Senate negotiators on
the industrial emissions section of the bill, said he believed an
acid rain agreement could be reached by the end of the week.
   Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., said he expects attempts by
Midwest lawmakers to push for additional measures to reduce the
cost of meeting new acid rain controls, but he said negotiators of
all points of view who want to get a bill enacted into law ``will
not put up with a lot of grandstanding at this point.''
   Wednesday's compromise followed long closed-door negotiations,
often late into the night against the deadline of an Oct. 26
adjournment, that began last weekend and for a time were bogged
down over whether to give the steel industry additional time to
comply with the new pollution controls.
   It was agreed to give steel companies another 20 years, to the
year 2020, to cut cancer-causing emissions from coke ovens. The
industry had argued the ovens would be forced to shut down without
the extension.
   The negotiations immediately turned to the bill's acid rain
provision, which would require electric utilities to cut annual
emissions of sulfur dioxide by 10 million tons by the end of the
decade.
   The Bush administration has estimated the bill, if enacted,
would cost the economy between $21 billion and $25 billion a year
once fully in effect. Environmentalists argue much of that amount
will be gained in reduced health care costs from cleaner air.
   Congressional sources said Wednesday that while some minor
issues remained to be worked out, House and Senate members agreed
on requiring industry to install new equipment aimed at cutting
toxic emissions from large factories by 90 percent over the next
decade.
   Toxic chemical emissions from smaller polluters would be reduced
by about 75 percent. The emissions cuts would be achieved by
requiring companies to install the most effective pollution control
technology available for a particular industry.
   Under the compromise, the Environmental Protection Agency also
would be required to direct polluters to take additional measures
after the turn of the century if the agency determines people near
industrial plants are not being assured of ``an ample margin of
safety'' against cancer-causing pollution.
   If those assurances are not met, plants could be closed.
   The legislation would regulate more than 250 types of pollution
sources. In addition, the compromise would for the first time
require new safeguards and response programs in the event of
accidental releases of toxic chemicals,
   Both the House and Senate approved clean air bills by a wide
margin earlier this year. But the conference committee negotiations
aimed at resolving differences in the bills has at times slowed to
a virtual standstill.
   A breaktrough came Oct. 10 when the two sides reached agreement
on measures to reduce smog-causing pollution from automobiles and
trucks.

<HEAD>Critics Attack Gorbachev's Plan for Transition to Market Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Critics attacked President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
toned-down economic reform plan on Wednesday, and an architect of a
more radical transition program protested the retreat by offering
his resignation.
   The reaction came two days after Gorbachev won the Nobel Peace
Prize and the day after he unveiled his comparatively slow plan for
building a Western-style market economy in the Soviet Union.
   Grigory Yavlinsky, co-author of the original 500-day plan,
offered his resignation as deputy prime minister of Russia, the
largest of the 15 Soviet republics.
   In a speech to the Russian parliament, which adopted the 500-day
plan on Sept. 11, Yavlinsky did not mention Gorbachev by name. But
he predicted the president's reforms would set off disastrous price
increases.
   ``The market will be entered in this situation not through
(economic) stabilization, but through growing inflation,'' he said.
``All that the 500-day program and I, personally, promised in ...
living standards cannot be achieved now.''
   Boris Yeltsin, president of Russia and Gorbachev's main
political rival, on Tuesday criticized the president's plan,
calling it a ``catastrophe'' that is ``doomed to fail'' within
months.
   Leaders in the Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia
have shown little willingness to go along with the national reform
plan. Their regional economies are more westernized and efficient
than the rest of the Soviet system, and they have announced their
desire both for political independence and rapid moves toward free
enterprise.
   Several other republics, particularly Georgia and the Ukraine,
also are pushing for autonomy and may reject Gorbachev's plan.
   Approval of Gorbachev's plan is not even certain in the national
legislature, which is scheduled to begin debating it Friday. Two
legislators told The Associated Press they doubted it would pass.
   ``It's not detailed enough. It doesn't go far enough,'' said one
of the lawmakers, who spoke on condition they not be identified.
   Gorbachev's plan is an attempt to merge the radical 500-day plan
- drafted by economists headed by Yavlinsky and economist Stanislav
Shatalin - with several other proposals, including a far more
conservative plan presented by Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov.
   Yavlinsky, 38, accused Ryzhkov's cabinet of putting the
conservative plan into effect ``through the back door'' while the
national legislature engaged in ``endless delays'' in choosing a
reform program. The Russian parliament voted last month to proceed
on its own with the 500-day plan, but has yet to take concrete
steps to do so.
   Yavlinsky formally tendered his resignation to the Russian
lawmakers, but they postponed acting on it.
   ``This was a speech by a hot-headed youth, not a mature
statesman,'' said the republic's prime minister, Ivan Silayev, who
urged the parliament to reject the resignation.
   Gorbachev is scheduled to defend his plan in a speech to the
national legislature on Friday. The 542-member Supreme Soviet could
vote on it as early as Saturday, although some lawmakers said a
longer debate was likely.
   The four-stage Gorbachev plan would begin by reducing the
national budget deficit, now about $100 billion, and cutting the
money supply, which has grown rapidly in recent years, spurring
inflation.
   Western experts estimate Soviets have saved billions of dollars
worth of rubles in banks or under their mattresses, because there
is little to buy in state stores.
   Efforts also would be made in the first stage to improve
production of consumer goods, now in short supply, and to boost
agricultural output through land reform.
   Each republic would be allowed to decide whether to break
collective farms into private plots. In the second stage, at an
unspecified date, prices on roughly 70 percent of all goods and
services would be freed to respond to market forces. The central
government would continue to set prices on fuel, key raw materials
and necessities such as bread, milk and sugar.
   Small private businesses also would be encouraged during the
second stage, and a social welfare net would be established to help
workers who lose their jobs.
   The third stage would emphasize establishing a free market for
housing, a modern banking system and entrepreneurship.
   The final stage would end government monopolies in many
industries and allow the ruble to be freely traded against other
world currencies, encouraging foreign investment in the Soviet
Union.
   Unlike the 500-day plan, Gorbachev's proposal contains no time
schedule. It says that similar transitions in other countries have
taken 1{ to 2 years.
   Growing shortages of staples such as meat, gasoline and paper
have eroded public support for Gorbachev, and skepticism over his
plan appears widespread.
   ``I think in the existing situation, all the plans (for economic
reform) are unrealistic,'' said Ninel Ilyicheva, 55, a publishing
house worker. ``I don't see that Gorbachev is really accomplishing
anything. I only hear him talk and talk and talk all the time.''
   Vladimir Orlov, 46, a Soviet army major, said he considers
Gorbachev ``a smart person'' who ``hasn't said his final word yet''
on the economy.

<TEXT>
   After a five-month absence, the Soviet Union
has bought some U.S. corn for delivery by the end of the year, the
Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Officials said private exporting companies sold 350,000 metric
tons to the Soviets under terms of the current long-term supply
agreement between the two countries. No prices or other details
were disclosed.
   The pact, including a three-month extension, expires Dec. 31. A
new five-year agreement will begin at that time.
   Although the Soviet Union recently bought some U.S. soybean
meal, it had not purchased significant quantities of wheat or corn
since last May. Department officials have speculated Moscow delayed
purchases to see how 1990 harvests turned out in both the Soviet
Union and the United States.
   Other factors mentioned have included Russian hard currency
problems, the direction of U.S. farm legislation and whether the
United States might extend credit.
   Rumors have circulated in the grain trade for weeks that the
Soviet Union was or soon would be in the market for more U.S. corn.
Market prices have been under pressure from this fall's huge
harvest, estimated by the department at 8.02 billion bushels, up 7
percent from the 1989 crop.
   Large sales to foreign buyers must be reported daily to USDA by
exporters.
   Sales of wheat and corn to the Soviet Union for delivery during
the year that ended Sept. 30 totaled 20.3 million tons, including
nearly 16.5 million tons of corn and more than 3.8 million tons of
wheat.
   In addition, the Soviets in 1989-90 bought 342,300 tons of
soybeans, 1.37 million tons of soybean meal, and 7,300 tons of
barley.
   The 350,000 tons reported Wednesday were the first corn sales
for the three-month extension, although soybean meal sales amount
to 355,000 tons.
   A metric ton of 2,205 pounds is equivalent to 39.4 bushels of
corn. Thus, the 350,000 tons would be about 13.8 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.23 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA's five-day average. Thus, the latest
sale could have a farm value of about $31 million.

<TEXT>
   Street demonstrations, student hunger strikes and
classroom boycotts forced the resignation Wednesday of the prime
minister of the Ukraine, the second most populous Soviet republic.
   The ouster of Prime Minister Vitaly Masol signalled an upsurge
in the separatist movement in the Ukraine, known as the Soviet
breadbasket.
   The Ukrainian parliament also passed a resolution embracing
other student demands, including the transfer of ownership of
Communist Party property to the government and refusal to sign a
new treaty of union proposed by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev,
the state news agency Tass reported.
   The parliament earlier proclaimed Ukraine's right to overrule
national laws and barred Ukrainian youths drafted by the Soviet
military from serving outside the republic.
   The unrest in the Ukraine and criticism of Gorbachev's economic
program struck new blows at the Soviet president's attempts to
maintain a semblance of central authority.
   Radicals have rejected Gorbachev's proposed treaty of union,
which would redefine political and economic links among the 15
republics, nearly all of which have declared some form of
sovereignty from the central government.
   Yeltsin and others want the republics to negotiate forms of
cooperation among themselves.
   Tens of thousands of students in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev
celebrated their victory by marching Wednesday evening through
October Revolution Square, which they renamed Independence Square
to reflect the growing separatist movement, said spokeswoman
Natalia Preobrazhenskaya.
   Members of the Ukrainian legislature, opposition leaders and
students addressed the festive rally, called to celebrate the end
of a hunger strike that started on Oct. 2, she said.
   The students began the hunger strike demanding the Ukrainian
government move faster to achieve independence from the Soviet
Union.
   By the end, about 200 students were going without food, pressing
for the resignation of Masol, dissolution of parliament and new
elections for the republic.
   News media that reported Masol's resignation did not indicate
whether parliament would be dissolved or new elections scheduled.
   The Ukraine was independent briefly after the 1917 Bolshevik
Revolution. The eastern Ukraine had been part of czarist Russia
from about the year 1700, when the nomadic warriors known as
Cossacks threw their allegiance from Poland to Russia. The western
Ukraine was part of Poland until World War II.
   Masol told Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk of his decision
to quit Tuesday, and submited his resignation Wednesday, Tass said,
quoting an unidentified parliamentary source. Masol, 62, was
appointed prime minister in June.
   Doctors sent an appeal to the Ukrainian legislature on Wednesday
warning the students' health was being damaged by their hunger
strike.
   Rukh, a nationalist Ukrainian organization, said 100,000
students marched peacefully through Kiev to the republic's Supreme
Soviet building on Wednesday. The figure could not be confirmed
independently.
   The protests also spread to other Ukrainian cities, reported
Interfax, an independent news agency. In Lvov, along the Polish
border, 20,000 students boycotted classes on Tuesday and 40
students and instructors from the Polytechnic Institute staged a
one-day hunger strike, Interfax reported.
   It said 1,500 high school and trade school students picketed the
building of the Lvov regional Communist Party committee.
   On Monday, students went on strike in Kiev, and up to 50,000
marched through the city to the Ukrainian parliament building,
Interfax and the Postfactum news agency reported.
   Thousands of students carrying blue and yellow Ukrainian flags
marched through Kiev again on Tuesday in an unsuccessful attempt to
enlist worker support, Interfax said. It did not give a precise
crowd estimate.

   The Israeli government and its influential
lobby find themselves in an awkward position: they oppose a move by
a number of pro-Israeli senators to block a $7.5 billion arms sale
to Saudi Arabia.
   The senators, led by Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and Bob Packwood,
R-Ore., submitted a resolution opposing the sale hours after
leaders of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee urged them
to back off, said sources familiar with the affair.
   ``This is the first time that pro-Israel forces have ever tried
to block opposition to a major arms sale to one of Israel's
enemies,'' said one Capitol Hill source.
   The administration last month notified Congress that it plans to
sell the Saudis $7.54 billion in tanks, antitank missiles, rocket
launchers, Apache gunships and other weapons deemed necessary to
block an attack from Iraq. If Congress doesn't oppose the deal by
Oct. 27, it goes into effect.
   The administration is banking on support for its anti-Iraq
policy to push the sale through Congress, where pro-Israeli
lawmakers probably would have balked at the unprecedented sale to
an Arab state.
   The State Department reasoned that lawmakers would be unpopular
with their constituents if they opposed selling weapons to a
country where more than 150,000 American troops are deployed.
   Israel and its lobbyists in Washington have objected - often
successfully - to every major Saudi arms sale in the past decade,
building an almost legendary reputation of influence in the
process.
   But AIPAC, bowing to reality, decided to hold its fire until the
administration presents to Congress a second package for the Saudis
next January, sources said.
   That proposal, estimated at over $10 billion, is expected to
include the latest F-15 jet fighters and is of significantly
greater concern to Israel and its supporters than the largely
land-based arsenal being proposed now.
   ``We're concerned about both deals,'' said AIPAC spokeswoman
Toby Dershowitz. ``We're working with Congress and the
administration to satisfy the concerns about Saudi needs in this
crisis and Israel's security needs,'' she said.
   The lobby's strategy to withhold opposition to the first sale
also grew out of concern about jeopardizing various proposals in
the House and Senate to help Israel get millions of dollars in
emergency weapons against a threatened Iraqi attack.
   A delegation of Jewish leaders went to Secretary of Defense Dick
Cheney last month and promised him it would not oppose this current
sale. Similar assurances were given by AIPAC to the State
Department's policy planner, Dennis Ross. And one of the Jewish
community's top leaders, Max Fisher, paid a call on President Bush
and offered his support, too.
   Imagine, then, the administration's surprise when it discovered
last week a well-advanced plan by a group of senators to oppose
large portions of the Saudi sale.
   But when Ross called AIPAC director Tom Dine to complain, he was
in for an even bigger surprise. AIPAC, which has been credited by
critics and supporters alike for having vast pull in Congress,
didn't know about the lawmakers' plan, the sources said.
   AIPAC denies Dine was surprised. ``We've been in consultation
with the Congress all along on the best way to achieve our mutual
objectives,'' said Dershowitz.
   ``Alan (Cranston) did this on his own,'' said the senator's
spokesman, Murray Flander. ``He didn't consult AIPAC.''
   Dine, worried that AIPAC's credibility was on the line, went to
see Cranston and asked him to desist. Another AIPAC leader called
Packwood, sources said.
   But Cranston objected, and submitted his resolution of
disapproval of the Saudi sale, along with cosponsors Packwood,
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., and Paul Simon,
D-Ill.
   On the Senate floor, Cranston asked if the idea is to sell the
Saudis what they need now to deter Iraq, why is the administration
proposing to sell them 150 MiA2 tanks which haven't been built yet
and won't be delivered until 1993?
   In addition, Cranston argued, the weapons could fall into enemy
hands in the volatile region, as did U.S. arms in Kuwait.
   Furthermore, Cranston said, ``We may, as momentary brothers in
arms, forget who the Saudis consider to be their real, longtime,
irreconcilable enemies,'' namely Israel.
   Reps. David Obey, D-Wis., and Mel Levine, D-Calif., also
introduced a resolution seeking to turn down the Patriots, 150 M1A2
tanks and 12 Apaches, about $4.5 billion of the $7.5 billion
package.
   The sales, Obey said Wednesday, ``would accelerate the arms race
in the Middle East caldron which already has massive amounts of
advanced military weapons and equipment.''
   Aides to Cranston say he is waiting to see whether the Senate
adopts a host of measures designed to provide Israel with as much
as $1 billion in weapons before deciding whether to forge ahead
with the anti-Saudi resolution.
   Senior lawmakers, including Appropriations Committee Chairman
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., have serious concerns about the pro-Israel
amendment, however, and may seek to kill it, said congressional
sources.

<HEAD>Justice Department To Require Prisoners To Attain 12th-Grade
Skills</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 1 graf with list of 10 prisons in pilot program</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

   Federal prison inmates soon will be required
to attend classes until they can read at the 12th-grade level and
complete a high-school equivalency degree, the Justice Department
said Wednesday.
   If they refuse to do so, they will be consigned to the
lowest-paying prison jobs and they could be subjected to
disciplinary actions, the department said.
   Federal prisoners are currently required to attend classes if
they cannot read or perform math problems at the eighth-grade
level. Under the higher standards, inmates will be required to
master 12th-grade academic skills by attending prison classes, the
department said.
   Tougher literacy standards are intended to raise the chance that
inmates will not return to crime once they are released from
prison.
   ``For most who cannot read, competing in the legitimate work
world is impossible,'' Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in
remarks prepared for delivery to an international conference on
prison literacy in Ottawa.
   ``We live in a complex world, and the pressure of competition
for good-paying jobs, and indeed success in virtually every aspect
of modern life, hinges on literacy,'' Thornburgh said.
   The higher standards are being imposed at a time when 20 percent
of the 58,000 federal inmates cannot read at the eighth-grade level
and 40 percent have a hitory of drug or alcohol abuse. The
Education Department says up to 30 million U.S. adults are
illiterate.
   ``We believe there is a straight-line relationship between
literacy levels and an individual's likelihood of involvement in
substance abuse,'' Thornburgh said.
   Many former inmates who cannot read ``turn to drug abuse as an
escape, or else come to rely on selling drugs to survive,''
Thornburgh said.
   The Bureau of Prisons began the mandatory literacy program in
the early 1980s. Inmates who did not pass tests of sixth-grade
reading and math skills were required to attend classes. The
standard was raised later to mastery of eighth-grade skills.
   The 12th-grade standard, now being enforced as part of a pilot
program at 10 facilities, will take effect throughout the federal
prison system early next year, said Gregory L. Bogdan, a Bureau of
Prisons spokesman.
   Under the old policy, all federal prisoners must take the
reading and math skills tests, no matter what degrees they may have
earned, Bogdan said. Under the new policy, inmates who can document
that they have at least a high school diploma will not have to take
any tests and will be exempt from the class requirement, he said.
   Inmates are required to attend classes for 90 days. Those who
refuse to do so could face disciplinary action such as loss of
privileges, additional work hours and possible transfer to an
institution with a higher level of security, Bogdan said, although
he added, ``I'm not aware of anyone that's ever refused to that
extent.''
   Inmates who attend classes for 90 days but refuse to continue
after that will be consigned to earning the lowest wages in prison
jobs, said Bogdan, who once worked as a teacher and principal of
the school at the Lewisburg, Pa., federal penitentiary.
   ``Our job in the education department was to motivate these
guys, force the exposure'' to academic subjects, Bogdan said.
   Inmates also are required to work while in prison, either as
clerks and orderlies or in the Federal Prison Industries Program.
Inmates earn between 11 cents and 36 cents an hour doing ordinary
prison jobs but can earn as much as $1.05 an hour in prison
industry jobs.
   But prisoners who refuse to attend school classes can't earn
more than 11 cents an hour in menial jobs or 44 cents an hour in
prison industry, Bogdan said.
   There are also other incentives for completing the program, he
said.
   An inmate who becomes eligible for parole would not want any
comments about disciplinary actions to be seen by the parole board,
he said.
   Class attendance also would enhance an inmate's chances to be
placed in a halfway house toward the end of a prison sentence,
Bogdan said.
   Last year, 10,546 federal inmates completed eighth-grade
requirements and 3,100 finished high-school equivalency programs,
Thornburgh said. Another 1,781 finished programs that taught
English as a second language.
   A total of 15,000 federal inmates were enrolled last year in
continuing education classes, the attorney general said.
   ``There is a general consensus that basic literacy not only
helps the prisoner after release but, equally important,
contributes to a better life while in prison and to a safer
environment for both staff an inmates,'' Thornburgh said.
   The 10 prisons participating in the pilot literacy program are
the Federal Correctional Institutes at McKean, Pa.; Fairton, N.J.;
Lexington, Ky.; Morgantown, W.Va.; Jesup, Ga.; Sheridan, Ore.;
Pleasanton, Calif.; Sandstone, Minn.; Bastrop, Texas; and El Reno,
Okla.

   The Council of Europe agreed Wednesday
to admit Hungary as its first East European member as part of an
expansion plan that officials hope will give the low-profile
council a larger international role.
   Hungary will formally become the 24th council member at a Nov. 6
ministrial meeting in Rome. On Nov. 5, Hungarian officials will
sign the European Human Rights Convention, a prerequisite for
joining the oldest postwar organization striving for European unity
and cooperation.
   The council, founded in 1949 and based in this city on the
French-German border, is best known for its human rights
convention. Its work long has been overshadowed by the more
powerful 12-nation European Community, based in Brussels.
   Council officials said four other East European countries are in
line to join.
   Last year, as the Iron Curtain disappeared, Czechoslovakia,
Poland, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia were all given a ``special
guest status.''
   The council requires that its candidate members be parliamentary
democracies. The Soviet Union does not yet meet that requirement.
   The council's goal is to expand into an organization that unites
all of Europe and North America in a single security structure.
   To that effect, the council is seeking to become the home of a
parliamentary assembly of the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe that groups the United States, Canada and 32
European nations.
   The other Council of Europe members are Austria, Belgium,
Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland,
Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands,
Norway, Portugal, San Marino, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey
and Britain.

<TEXT>
   Sandinista investors announced
Wednesday the formation of a new international airline,
highlighting the group's switch from the revolutionary to the
entrepreneurial after a decade of beating up on big business.
   Central American Airlines will start flying the Miami-Managua
route on Oct. 27 for $275 roundtrip, the lowest fare between the
two cities among carriers serving the region. The ticket is to
include free cocktails.
   At a news conference, Herty Lewites, the former tourism minister
under the Sandinistas, said, ``The Sandinista Front has zero
(investment) in this company.''
   But a journalist from Cuba's state Prensa Latina news agency
quipped, ``I don't think even Herty's grandmother believes that.''
Insiders involved with the airline say Sandinista party investment
is as high as 25 percent.
   Lewites established the only money-making state enterprises in
Nicaragua during the Sandinista era, earning the nickname of
Commander Dollar.
   Top investors in the airline include Lewites, former Sandinista
Finance Minister William Hupper and Xavier Chamorro, a relative of
President Violeta Chamorro.
   Lewites said 68 percent of the airline is locally owned and 32
percent by ``Saudi Arabians and Greek Arabs,'' and that the initial
investment has been $1 million.
   ``The Sandinista Front (commonly known by its Spanish initials
FSLN) will not be able to get to power again by way of arms, but by
votes, and elections cost a lot of money,'' Lewites said. ``I'm
going to give (the Front) as much as I can.''
   Nicaragua's next presidential elections are scheduled for 1996.
Mrs. Chamorro and a 14-party coalition ended a decade of Sandinista
rule in Feb. 25 elections.
   The Miami-Managua route, the only one the airline will fly for
its first three months, will use a Boeing 727 rented for $35,000 a
month from a U.S. company, Lewites said.
   The company is planning to buy its own commercial jet next
February.
   Plans also include flights to Los Angeles and San Francisco,
Mexico City, Madrid, Spain, and London.
   After the Sandinista's election loss the United States lifted
the 1985 trade embargo against Nicaragua. U.S. airlines that fly to
Nicaragua or plan to include American, Pan Am and Continental.
   Regional airlines with Miami-Managua service include Aviateca,
the Guatemalan carrier; Lacsa, the Costa Rican airline; and Sahsa,
from Honduras.
   There is a state domestic airline, Aeronica, which also flies to
Miami and to most of Central America.
   The new airline, called CAAL for its Spanish initials, is among
many private enterprises the Sandinista Front and its militants
have started after the electoral defeat.
   The Sandinistas led the long struggle that overthrew the late
President Anastasio Somoza in July 1979. Many of their leaders
espoused Marxist ideology and had trained in communist countries.
   The leftist policies and a U.S.-sponsored guerrilla war
destroyed the economy, leading to voters casting their ballots for
the more conservative coalition led by Mrs. Chamorro.

   A low-pressure system moving across the upper Mississippi Valley
brought snow to Minnesota and the Dakotas on Wednesday, and showers
and thunderstorms to northern Wisconsin and Upper Michigan.
   Snow fell over northern and western Minnesota and the Dakotas,
with snowfall totals of 4 to 8 inches expected, and up to 12 inches
of snow possible near Lake Superior.
   Strong wind circulated around the storm system crossing the
upper Mississippi Valley, reducing visibility in blowing snow.
   North Dakotans battled sloppy, slippery roads in their first
dose of winter-like weather.
   Barnes County authorities advised no travel in the Valley City
area when gusty north wind and snow kept visibility near zero.
   ``We've had about four semi accidents and three or four car
accidents, and numerous cars in the ditch with no damage so we
really didn't count those,''said Dan Anderson, Barnes County
Sheriff's dispatcher.
   In South Dakota, some meetings were canceled in the Mobridge
area, and two schools closed early. Classes offered by Standing
Rock College of Fort Yates, N.D., were called off in Mobridge.
   Thunderstorms over northern Wisconsin produced dime-size hail
south of Berlin during the morning. And before the snow moved in,
thunderstorms over northeastern Minnesota that produced hail an
inch in diameter at Cloquet.
   Showers and thunderstorms over Upper Michigan produced 0.97 inch
of rain during the six hours up to 7 a.m.
   A line of thunderstorms developed from eastern Iowa to
northeastern Oklahoma.
   Strong northwesterly wind blew were over the central high Plains
region during the night, gusting to 74 mph in northeastern Colorado
at Grover and to 65 mph in southeastern Wyoming.
   Showers and thunderstorms associated with a warm front were
scattered from eastern Texas and eastern Oklahoma through the
central Gulf Coast region to the Florida Peninsula during the
afternoon.
   A storm system over the Pacific Ocean spread rain and strong
wind toward Washington state and toward the southern panhandle of
Alaska.
   Afternoon temperatures were only in the 30s from the northern
half of the high Plains region to northern Minnesota.
   Wednesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 7 above zero at West
Yellowstone, Mont.

   There's no home cooking in the Saudi desert
for American GIs, but some are now enjoying the familiar tastes of
cookies, cakes and Kool-Aid.
   The treats are courtesy of American companies and individuals
who have donated a wide variety of food, drinks, games, exercise
equipment and other goods. They're being shipped to the Arabian
desert by the Pentagon's Defense Logistics Agency.
   Among the food items donated: 20,000 three-ounce bags of
pretzels from Atlanta; 400 bushels of apples from Albany, N.Y.;
150,000 boxes of cookies from Reading, Calif.; 50,000 cans of
sardines from Prospect Harbor, Maine, and 12,500 pound cakes from
Hileah, Fla.
   To wash the goodies down: 2,000 cases of near-beer, 11,000 cases
of Gatorade and 47 tons of juices.
   Also making the 7,000-mile trip to Saudi Arabia are 1,000 pairs
of dumbbells from Opelika, Ala.; 1,000 high-visibility footballs
from Chicago, and 1,000 flying rings and boomerangs from Palo Alto,
Calif.
   Among the most ambitous mailings was a donation by the
Chicago-based retailer Montgomery Ward of 450 video cameras, along
with blank recording tapes and return mail envelopes to enable
soldiers to give the folks back home a picture of life in Operation
Desert Shield.
   People or companies wishing to send items to the troops in the
Middle East should call the Defense Logistics Agency, which
determines whether the goods are acceptable and arranges for
shipment of approved items directly to Saudi Arabia. The agency
screens donations through a special hotline phone number,
703-274-3561.

   Three auto consumer groups asked Americans on
Wednesday to refuse to buy any car not equipped with air bags. They
chastised most Japanese automakers for lagging behind U.S. and
European counterparts in plans to install the crash-protection
devices.
   Chrysler, which is providing drivers' air bags in virtually all
of its 1991 cars, drew a limited salute from the three groups,
Motor Voters, the Center for Auto Safety, and the U.S. Public
Interest Research Group.
   But even Chrysler was faulted for not equipping its popular
minivans with air bags, and for not moving more quickly to make
them standard equipment for front-seat passengers in cars.
   The three consumer organizations staged news conferences and
demonstrations in 12 cities to propose the boycott, and focused
their ire on Japanese economy models.
   Rosemary Dunlap, president of Motor Voters, noted that many
automakers equip their luxury vehicles with air bags, but not the
lower-priced ones, claiming the $320 devices would drive away
bargain hunters.
   But Chrysler, she noted, has several economy models - variations
of the Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance - with driver air bags as
standard equipment. ``If Chrysler can put air bags in a car for
under $8,000, what's Honda's excuse for leaving them out of the
Civic CRX, which costs over $11,000?'' she asked.
   Honda has announced it will make air bags standard equipment in
all cars in 1994. Currently, the only Honda-built car sold in the
United States with air bags is the top-of-the-line Acura Legend,
retailing for over $20,000.
   According to industry projections for the current model year, 45
percent of Ford's cars and 33 percent of General Motors' cars will
be sold with at least a driver air bag. Six companies, BMW, Isuzu,
Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Saab, and Volvo, equip all their U.S. cars
with air bags, while five others - Hyundai, Peugeot, Suzuki,
Sterling and Yugo - have no such models.
   The figure for Toyota is 27 percent, for Nissan 20 percent, for
Mazda 15 percent, and for Mitsubishi, 1 percent.
   As of this year, federal law required all cars to be equipped
with front-seat ``passive restraints'' - meaning either air bags or
motorized shoulder harnesses. The exception is that if a driver air
bag is installed, the automaker is free to wait until 1994 to equip
the same model with a passenger bag. Meanwhile, that car can be
marketed with normal seat and shoulder beats on the passenger's
side.
   ``The Japanese auto industry's three-year delay in installing
air bags condemns over 7,500 Americans to death and another 125,000
to serious injury,'' said Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center
for Auto Safety.
   ``Air bags are lifesavers - there is no good reason why
consumers should be forced to choose between safety and economy,''
said Lucinda Sikes, an attorney for U.S. PIRG. ``We are calling ...
for air bags in economical as well as luxury models; for the front
seat passenger as well as the driver; and in light trucks and
minivans as well as passenger cars.''

   The Association of American Publishers
announced plans Wednesday to send more than 200,000 paperbacks to
Operation Desert Shield forces in the Persian Gulf.
   They titles will run the gamut from mysteries to adventure tales
and techno-thrillers, the association said.
   Jack Hoeft, chairman of the trade group's paperback publishing
division, said paperbacks have been a link with home for U.S.
servicemen overseas since World War II, when 130 million specially
printed Armed Services Editions were sent to U.S. fighting forces.
   The books are being contributed by Avon, Ballantine, Bantam,
Berkley, Dell, HarperCollins, Penguin USA, Pocket Books, St.
Martin's Press, Warner and Zebra Books and should begin reaching
U.S. troops by early November.
   About half of the paperbacks will be put in ``Oasis Packages''
being prepared by the United Services Organizations. These are gym
bags which will also include writing paper, audio cassettes and
sunglasses.
   The rest will be distributed by the Defense Department to troops
already in the Persian Gulf and to those embarking for service
there.

<HEAD>East German Secret Police Said To Have Perpetrated Big Scam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former East German secret police are
responsible for a scam that raked in $2 billion from the two
Germanys' July 1 monetary union, the newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung
reported Wednesday.
   The newspaper, which cited Berlin Justice State Secretary
Wolfgang Schomburg as its source, telexed its report to other news
organizations in advance of Thursday's publication.
   The fraud scheme was first revealed on Tuesday.
   Officials said then that four people were arrested for allegedly
bilking the Bonn government of $333 million by falsifying trade
accounts to qualify for a conversion of transfer rubles into German
marks.
   The German mark became East Germany's official currency on July
1.
   The Sueddeutsche Zeitung, with headquarters in Munich, quoted
Schomburg as saying the actual amount that was swindled is closer
to $2 billion.
   He also said that three of the four suspects belonged to a
``special detail'' of the now-disbanded Stasi secret police, the
daily reported.
   Government officials believe the fraud started after suspects
presented the German Foreign Trade Bank in Berlin with false
documents purportedly showing exports of East German goods to East
European nations.
   That apparently qualified the suspects to receive a special rate
for converting transfer rubles into German marks.

Congress wrongly forced the tribe to lease its land for 115 years
to the city of Salamanca, N.Y.
   ``We took advantage of the Seneca Nation and now we ought to
correct this injustice,'' said Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., who
introduced the bill in the Senate along with Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
R-N.Y.
   The Senate passed the measure by voice vote late Tuesday. The
bill, originally sponsored by Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., passed the
House on Oct. 10.
   Administration officials, however, have said the government is
not financially liable for the low rents paid to the Senecas and
they oppose the measure because of its cost. President Bush has 10
days in which to sign it, veto it or simply allow it to pass into
law unsigned.
   The bill would ratify an agreement reached by Salamanca, three
nearby villages and the Seneca Nation to replace a 99-year lease
accord expiring Feb. 19, 1991.
   The lease arrangements date to the 1860s and '70s, when whites
moved onto Seneca lands in western New York to work on railroads
and drill for oil. They leased the land at extremely low rents from
individual Senecas.
   In 1875, Congress confirmed these leases, despite their dubious
legality. Fifteen years later, Congress extended the leases for 99
years with no provision to raise the rents.
   Thus, about 85 percent of the city of Salamanca is leased from
the Senecas, at rents that were frozen as low as $1 per year.
   Under the bill, the federal government would pay $35 million to
the tribe to make up for some of its financial loss. The state of
New York must also pay $25 million, which will require state
legislation.

   Harvard Professor Elias James Corey
cracked open his fortune cookie at a Chinese restaurant last week
and read the good news: ``You will soon receive a high prize or
award.''
   Wednesday, the news materialized via a graduate student: He had
won the Nobel Prize in chemistry.
   A few miles down the Charles River, two scientists at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Wednesday learned they had
won the award in physics.
   Corey, a Harvard professor since 1959, won for work in organic
synthesis. His experiments helped make hundreds of medications more
readily available and affordable.
   Jerome I. Friedman and Henry W. Kendall, both of MIT, won for
proving the existence of quarks, particles smaller than a proton or
a neutron.
   They shared the award with Richard E. Taylor, a Canadian
scientist at Stanford University in California. The three had
delved into the heart of the atom in experiments conducted at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in the late 1960s and early
'70s.
   Each Nobel is worth about $700,000.
   At Harvard, young chemists popped open beer cans and applauded
Corey as he emerged from his office Wednesday morning.
   ``It never occurred to me I'd be a professor,'' the 62-year-old
son of Lebanese immigrants told a news conference. ``One's
expectations were not very high. Of course, I never would have
dreamed I would be so successful.''
   But MIT Professor John Sheehan knew Corey was headed for
greatness.
   ``He was an excellent student,'' Sheehan said. ``He had a little
something special, something extra.''
   The three physicists were recognized for work that has helped
scientists understand the basic structure of the universe.
   Their experiments with the atom and its smaller components have
given scientists ``a better understanding of the way the world is
put together,'' said Eugene Mollove, a MIT science writer. The
discovery became the basic model of particle physics.
   ``As human beings, we have great curiosity about how nature
works,'' said Friedman, 60, who lives in the Boston suburb of
Brookline. ``Knowing the structure of matter ultimately has to have
some effect on how you model the entire structure of things.''
   Friedman learned of the award when his wife woke him with the
news.
   ``I thought I was still asleep and dreaming,'' he said from a
hotel in Fort Worth, Texas, where he was attending a conference.
   Friedman stepped down as head of the MIT physics department this
year to pursue teaching and research.
   Kendall joked that it was ``very civilized'' of the Nobel
committee to phone him with the news at 5 a.m.
   He said the work was done during the ``golden age'' of
governmental subsidies for science.
   ``It was done 20 years ago, so I found it delightful and
unexpected,'' Kendall said.
   Kendall, 63, who lives in the Boston suburb of Sharon, has been
chairman of the Union of Concerned Scientists since 1973. The group
has opposed weapons such as the B-2 stealth bomber and called for
more safety precautions at nuclear power plants.
   ``He's a rare breed of scientist who's been able to come out of
the laboratory and work quite vigorously for the benefit of
humankind,'' said Howard Ris, the union's executive director.
   ``Isn't it wonderful for once when two guys who weren't working
to get it'' got the prize, said Martin Deutsch, an emeritus
professor at MIT. ``They did their work because they wanted to know
about the world.''
   Taylor, contacted at his Stanford, Calif., home Wednesday
morning, said he was surprised to hear the group had received the
prize. Taylor, 60, was born in Medicine Hat, Alberta, is a Stanford
University professor.
   Taylor said he was asleep when he got the good news in a
telephone call about 4 a.m.: ``One thing that's remarkable is how
little you say when the conversation starts with the secretary of
the academy in Sweden.''

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the anti-abortion group Operation
Rescue burned a court order on the steps of the U.S. Courthouse on
Wednesday, accusing the judge who signed it of violating their
constitutional rights.
   U.S. District Judge Louis Oberdorfer ruled Oct. 4 that any
organization or individual that pays the bills of Operation Rescue
is liable for fines resulting from anti-abortion protests that
violate a permanent injunction the judge issued earlier this year.
   Oberdorfer issued the order after attorneys for the National
Organization for Women and Planned Parenthood of America produced
evidence that Operation Rescue kept donations in bank accounts of
allied organizations.
   Randall Terry, the group's leader, called Oberdorfer's latest
order ``a frontal assault on freedom of association.''
   ``The judge is in the hip pocket of the abortion industry,''
Terry said.
   In July, Oberdorfer had held Operation Rescue and several of its
organizers in contempt of a preliminary injunction that prohibited
demonstrators from blocking the entrances to local abortion clinics
during protests last November.
   Oberdorfer made the injunction permanent in January.
   Operation Rescue has been the subject of numerous court
injunctions around the country barring anti-abortion protesters
from interfering with the operation of abortion clinics.
   For violating Oberdorfer's injunction, the group was ordered to
pay $6,013 in damages to three local abortion clinics, plus
attorneys' fees, which have tentatively been set at $42,000.
   As a result of Oberdorfer's latest order, Terry vowed to take
the organization ``underground'' by closing its national
headquarters in Binghamton, N.Y., and its bank accounts.
   ``We will keep doing everything that we are doing,'' Terry said,
but the group will function ``without a national office that just
sits there as a target for these harassing lawsuits.''
   ``We will become a moving target,'' he said.
   Terry also invited supporters to attend three days of
anti-abortion protests in the nation's capital Nov. 15-17 that he
called ``D.C. Project II.''
   Terry declined to say if protesters would block the entrances to
abortion clinics, as they did during last year's ``D.C. Project.''
But the leaflet distributed by Operation Rescue referred to
``child-saving activity.''
   NOW's attorney, Laurence J. Eisenstein, said: ``There is no
doubt these same people who were held in contempt once, intend to
be held in contempt again.''
   ``It is clear they intend to engage in the hiding of assets
which this order is meant to prevent,'' Eisenstein said.
   Patricia Ireland, the executive vice president of NOW, replied
in a statement that ``with his penchant for martyrdom, Randall
Terry would like the courts and the press to believe that Operation
Rescue has been crippled by unjust fines.''
   ``Today's showboating is yet another attempt to duck the group's
responsibility for repeat violations of the law,'' Ireland said.
``They are playing shell games with their assets in an attempt to
avoid vines that they do not wish to pay.''
   Eisenstein said he had produced evidence in civil depositions
that money donated to Operation Rescue had been turned over to the
Pro-Life Trust Fund. Other donations had been given on Operation
Rescue's behalf to the Committee to Protect the Family Foundation,
which Eisenstein said has paid at least $80,000 of the group's
bills this year.
   Much of the $43,500 that was put in a Pro-Life Trust bank
account earlier this year, was in the form of checks made out to
Operation Rescue and endorsed by Terry, Eisenstein said.

<BYLINE>Walesa Campaigns in Krakow, Given Honorary Citizenship
^By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KRAKOW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa appeared to
upstage his presidential rival Wednesday when he campaigned in
Tadeusz Mazowiecki's home turf and was greeted by larger crowds
than met Mazowieki a few days earlier.
   Traveling to southern Poland from his home in the Baltic city of
Gdansk, the Solidarity leader told crowds at several stops that
after battling to end Communist rule, he was ready to help build a
capitalist future.
   ``As I was able to overcome communism together with you, now I
am inviting you to help with building,'' Walesa told about 20,000
cheering supporters in the market square.
   Mazowiecki and Walesa were allies in Solidarity, the movement
that drove the Communists from power. But Walesa began to complain
shortly after Mazowiecki became prime minister in 1989 that he
wasn't moving fast enough.
   Walesa decided to run for president, and after Communist
President Wojciech Jaruzelski agreed to step down this fall,
Mazowiecki announced he would run against Walesa. The election is
Nov. 25.
   In his stop Wednesday, Walesa gave crowds in the medieval city
what they wanted to hear: he would clean up grimy historic
monuments to try to restore the beautiful stonework and sculptures.
   Speaking at the Sendzimir Steel Mill in Nowa Huta - formerly the
Lenin Steel Mill - he told workers their inefficient, polluting
plant might have to close. But alternative jobs must be found, he
said.
   ``Everyone must stop and think, because 28,000 people are
employed here,'' said Walesa. ``Those 28,000 people must have jobs.
Let's sit down and find something. I don't believe there is no
solution.''
   Mazowiecki edited the Krakow-based monthly Wiez for decades and
is linked to the progressive Catholic Znak publishing house in
Krakow.
   But Walesa, arriving in the city three days after Mazowiecki
kicked off his campaign here, appeared to receive at least one
crowd that was much larger than the one that sent off Mazowiecki.
   At his hour-long market-square rally, Walesa was applauded after
virtually every answer offered to the questions shouted from the
crowd.
   Walesa also held a 30-minute meeting with Krakow intellectuals
at the National Museum, and appealed for their support. Leading
Polish intellectuals have largely deserted his worker-based union
and rallied around Mazowiecki.
   ``Passing through the city, I felt the strength of workers and
here I want to feel the strength of your minds. I want to be wise
with your wisdom and strong with your strength,'' he said.
   Earlier, Walesa was feted at the town hall, where banners
announed ``I prefer Lech,'' and was made an honorary citizen of the
city.
   Krakow was Poland's capital until the end of the 16th century.
Spared by World War II's devastation, its medieval monuments
include the Wawel castle and cathedral with the tombs of kings,
queens and national heroes.
   But pollution from the industrial Silesia region and the Nowa
Huta mill - built by the Communists in the 1950s as part of a crash
industrialization program - have corroded and begrimed the old
monuments.
   Walesa also lay flowers at a simple monument in Nowa Huta for
Bogdan Wlosik, a teen-age protester allegedly beated to death by
police in 1982, when Poland's Communist government had imposed
martial law.

   President Vaclav Havel relieved
Defense Minister Miroslav Vacek of his duties on Wednesday and
temporarily entrusted the defense portfolio to the prime minister,
the state CTK news agency said.
   Vacek, 55, a career soldier and longtime Communist Party member,
had served as deputy defense minister under former Communist
Premier Ladislav Adamec.
   Wednesday's terse report gave no details or reasons for Havel's
decision, but it quoted Parliament deputy Michael Kocab as saying
the president realized it was ``high time'' for a civilian to head
the Defense Ministry.
   Havel's office declined comment.
   Interim defense duties were transferred to Premier Marian Calfa.
   Vacek later said on national television: ``I fully agree that it
is suitable that I resign.''
   But he added that ``the reservations some people had toward my
person do not contribute to the peace and atmosphere necessary for
carrying out complex changes, above all in the economic sphere.''
   After thanking Havel for supporting him through his nearly
11-month tenure, Vacek urged Czechoslovaks to change their attitude
toward the army.
   ``If you cannot love it, then as a start, at least abandon the
grudge,'' he said.
   Vacek played a major role in forming the coalition ``government
of national understanding'' under Calfa after Czechoslovakia's
peaceful revolution last November. It was the first government here
in 41 years not dominated by Communists.
   Vacek was appointed defense minister on Dec. 3, 1989, and left
the Communist Party three months later.
   ``The president voiced his appreciation that army Gen. Miroslav
Vacek did not permit the abuse of the army against the people by
anyone,'' CTK said, referring to the November revolution.
   But according to the agency, Kocab said Havel's decision was
based on findings of a presidential commission set up on Sept. 10
to investigate military activities during the November revolution.
   The commission is expected to submit its report Thursday.
   Unconfirmed reports say the army was to have been used against
the people who overthrew the Communist leadership through peaceful
street demonstrations.
   CTK said Havel also expressed his appreciation that Vacek
``loyally fulfilled all orders and initiated the process of
fundamental restructuring of the Czechoslovak army.''
   Some politicians blasted Vacek's appointment as defense chief in
the new coalition government in June, seeing him as an unnecessary
holdover of Communist influence.
   A petition, signed by prominent student leaders, was circulated
in Prague in recent weeks. It demanded Vacek's resignation and that
of Calfa, also a former Communist party member.
   CTK quoted the petition as saying, ``There is no way to ignore
the halfhearted nature of events over the last 10 months. . . . We
demand that all state bodies be cleansed of those who lack the
moral and professional qualities needed for executing their
functions.''
   Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus meanwhile urged cooperation from
trade unions on his sweeping economic reforms, which begin on Jan.
1, CTK reported.
   Klaus, who plans a radical free-market reform of the ailing
economy, warned workers and business against pursuing private
interests at the cost of the general welfare of the community, the
agency said.
   Czechoslovkia's economy, one of Europe's most developed between
the wars, has been devastated by four decades of Communist central
planning.

<HEAD>No Deceit in Customer Switches from AT&amp;T, MCI Tells Congress</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: INSERTS grafs 5-6: ``But Merrill,'' with AT&amp;T testimony</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   An MCI official Wednesday denied that his
company was deceiving consumers into switching their long-distance
service from AT&amp;T, saying AT&amp;T was exaggerating consumer
complaints.
   At a House hearing that featured continual verbal sniping
between representatives of the two bitter rivals, MCI
Communications Corp. Executive Vice President Eugene Eidenberg said
MCI wouldn't risk its integrity for the sake of a few fraudulently
gained customers.
   Eidenberg shrugged off claims by AT&amp;T that 90,000 of its
customers had been switched to another long-distance service
against their will in the past six months.
   ``Much more common than the intentional switching by an
inter-exchange (long-distance) carrier is a simple, honest
mistake,'' Eidenberg told the House Government Operation
subcommittee on government information, justice and agriculture.
   But Merrill Tutton, AT&amp;T vice president of consumer services,
cited an 86-year-old Connecticut woman who was asked to switch to
MCI. Even though she said she told the telemarketing caller that
her daughter handled her affairs, she was switched anyway, without
her approval, Tutton said.
   ``Time and time again consumers are being switched without their
authorization or consent,'' Tutton said.
   State and federal authorities and local phone companies have
received tens thousands of complaints about unauthorized switching,
particularly in the wake of recent advertising wars between MCI,
AT&amp;T and US Sprint.
   But Eidenberg said one family member may agree to a switch
without the knowledge of another, or clerical errors may occur at
local phone companies that process huge volumes of new phone orders
and service changes each month. Customers sometimes switch and then
change their minds.
   Eidenberg said AT&amp;T was ``grossly exaggerating'' the problem, in
which telephone marketing services call customers and ask them to
authorize switching long-distance companies. He said unauthorized
switching was a very small percentage of legitimate service
changes.
   ``Do not be taken in by AT&amp;T's self-interest in preserving its
market share,'' Eidenberg told the subcommittee.
   But Rep. Bob Wise, D-W.Va., said the number of complaints
probably was just the tip of the iceberg and that the problem,
known as ``slamming,'' won't go away until state and federal
regulators act.
   Federal rules now require only that the new long-distance
companies be able to present, on demand from a local phone company,
written authorization from a customer seeking a changeover. If a
customer complains and a written notice cannot be produced, the
company must pay to have the customer switched back to the original
carrier.
   But Richard Firestone, the Federal Communications Commission's
chief telephone regulator, testified that companies frequently
switch customers back to the original carrier without even
attempting to produce a written authorization.
   AT&amp;T has asked the FCC to require written authorization in
advance of any switch - a rule the FCC had in 1985 until
long-distance companies, including AT&amp;T, complained.
   MCI says customers won't switch if they have to sign something
in advance and it is urging the FCC to establish standards and
monitoring procedures for the telephone marketing companies, and
for easy return to the original carrier. The National Association
of Regulatory Utility Commissioners also said advance authorization
would favor the incumbent.

<HEAD>Former KGB Official Says Soviets Shot Wallenberg in 1947</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former KGB official says he saw records
indicating that Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who saved
thousands of Jews during World War II, was executed at least 33
years ago, The Times of London said Wednesday.
   Oleg Gordievsky, whose new book is being serialized in The
Times, said he saw the Wallenberg file in the archives of the
Soviet security agency.
   Soviet officials tried to recruit Wallenberg shortly after the
Red Army moved into Budapest in 1945, Gordievsky reportedly wrote
in the book. When Wallenberg refused, he was taken to the Soviet
Union and shot, ``not later than 1947,'' The Times reported.
   The Times has been serializing Gordievsky's book, ``KGB: The
Inside Story of Its Foreign Operations from Lenin to Gorbachev,''
which was coauthored by Christopher Andrew. Gordievsky's account of
Wallenberg's death was not included in the excerpts but reported in
a short news story in Wednesday's editions.
   Soviet authorities said in 1957 that Wallenberg died in 1947 in
Moscow's Lubyanka Prison. However, Wallenberg's relatives and other
members of the Wallenberg Commission have pressed for
investigations of reports that the diplomat was still alive.
   He would be 77 today if still alive.
   Members of the commission including Wallenberg's half-brother,
Guy von Dardel, went to Helsinki, Finland, last month in the hope
of pressing President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to discuss the case at their summit meeting.
   Swedish authorities have relayed reports to Soviet authorities
that Wallenberg was seen in the 1950s and '60s, with less reliable
reports of sightings continuing into the 1980s.
   The commission said last month Soviet authorities never looked
into the prison's records, although in 1957 the Soviets said they
had examined the records.

   Many U.S. high school students experience racism
in their schools and communities, and four of every 10 questioned
for a survey released Wednesday admitted they harbor racial or
religious prejudices.
   ``The survey shows that our children have learned how to hate,''
said Dr. Richard Lapchick, director of the Center for the Study of
Sport in Society at Northeastern University.
   The national survey, conducted by Louis Harris and Associates,
found 57 percent of 1,865 high school students questioned had
witnessed or heard about a racial incident. Students in grades 10
through 12 in public, private and parochial schools responded to
questionnaires between August 31 and September 18.
   Acts considered racially motivated included taunts, graffiti and
violent acts against people of a particular religion or race, said
Louis Harris, chairman of the polling company.
   The survey was conducted for Reebok International, Ltd., a
Stoughton-based sports apparel
   ``This is something that is indigenous to most of the country,''
Harris said.
   The survey found 61 percent of the students surveyed in the
South had knowledge of a racial act, compared with 58 percent in
the West, 50 percent in the Midwest and 57 percent in the East.
   The highest occurrences of racism occurred in suburban areas at
60 percent, while inner cities averaged 57 percent.
   The study didn't provide statistics per city. It had a margin of
error of plus or minus 3 percent.
   Harris said 25 percent of the students reported having been the
target of racial confrontations with violent overtones, though not
necessarily with actual violence. Blacks had the highest frequency
at 70 percent, followed by Hispanics at 67 percent.
   Forty-seven percent said when confronted with a racial incident
they would either join attackers or side against the group being
attacked.
   But, ``one out of every two high school students say they're
prepared to do everything they possibly can do to stop such
incidents from developing, and to cut them off once they start,''
Harris said.
   Four in 10 students admitted harboring prejudices against other
races or religious groups.
   ``The high numbers indicate that this is a crisis by any measure
indeed,'' Harris said. ``It's a crisis that cries out for some
constructive programs to attempt to ease tensions, and develop more
tolerance and understanding among these young people themselves.''

   Lawrencia Bembenek, who went from
waiting tables at a Playboy Club to police work, to jail for
killing her then-husband's ex-wife, was caught Wednesday in Canada
three months after she fled prison here.
   The 31-year-old Ms. Bembenek didn't resist when she was arrested
along with her fiance, Dominick Gugliatto, 34, in Thunder Bay,
Ontario, said Constable Andrew Rozdolsky of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police.
   Police arrested the pair in a basement apartment following tips
from callers who had seen the Bembenek case depicted on a
television show, ``America's Most Wanted,'' Rozdolsky said.
   Ms. Bembenek was serving a life sentence for murder in the 1981
killing of Christine Shultz, the former wife of Ms. Bembenek's
husband, Elfred Schultz, a Milwaukee police detective. They have
since divorced.
   Popularly known as ``Bambi,'' Ms. Bambenek allegedly escaped
July 15 from the Taycheedah Correctional Institute.
   She apparently made her getaway by crawling through the window
of a basement laundry room and jumping a 7-foot barbed wire fence,
authorities said.
   The former model from Milwaukee has lot of sympathy in her
hometown. Many people believe she is innocent of the killing.
   Her flight from prison inspired a Milwaukee mini-industry of
``Run Bambi Run'' T-shirts, bumper stickers and cutouts of the
former model. Rallies were held wishing her well as a fugitive.
   Once a waitress at the now-defunct Playboy club in Lake Geneva,
Wis., Ms. Bembenek joined the Milwaukee police force in the late
1970s. She was fired from the department in 1980 for lying about a
friend's marijuana arrest. A year later she was arrested for
killing Mrs. Schultz.
   It was Christine Schultz's two young sons who found her in her
bed, bound, gagged and shot in the back.
   A jury convicted Ms. Bembenek of murder despite testimony from
one of the victim's sons that the person seen in the house the
night of the killing was not Ms. Bembenek.
   Ms. Bembenek has failed so far in attempts to get a new trial.
   Ms. Bembenek and Gugliatto, who worked in a lawn-mower factory,
were being held in a Thunder Bay jail on charges of illegal
immigration and set to appear in court Thursday.
   Fond du Lac County Sheriff James Gilmore said a Thunder Bay
police detective interviewed Ms. Bembenek earlier Wednesday at the
restaurant.
   Her only identification, a birth certificate, didn't check out,
so police went to her apartment. They found Gugliatto outside with
a car packed and the couple apparently ready to leave, Gilmore
said.
   ``She obviously made a call - `pack up let's go.' The car was
packed. They think it was probably five minutes'' before they would
have fled, the sheriff added.
   Gilmore, the sheriff, said Wisconsin authorities didn't expect
the couple to be returned to the state at least until next week and
would let Canadian authorities complete deportation procedures
first.
   Ms. Bembenek faces an escape charge that would tack on five
years to the life sentence she was serving.
   At the time of her escape, she would have been eligible for
parole in 1993. Prison officials had called her a model prisoner.
   Louis Kebezes operated the restaurant where Ms. Bembenek worked
in Thunder Bay.
   ``She was an excellent waitress, an excellent person, very
polite with the public,'' he told WITI-TV in Milwaukee.
   Schultz, who retired from the Milwaukee police force and is a
homebuilder in Florida, said he was relieved to learn of his
ex-wife's arrest. He has said he has feared for his safety since
the escape.
   ``My family here in Florida is all very glad that she is is
custody,'' he said.

   President Carlos Menem signed a
decree restricting strikes Wednesday and three small bombs exploded
in an apparent protest against his harsh economic reform program.
   The decree, which penalizes unions staging wildcat strikes and
allows workers to be fired without severance pay under certain
conditions, came on the 45th anniversary of the foundation of the
labor-based Peronist movement.
   Menem's opponents took the opportunity to note how far he had
strayed from the populist Peronist program that got him elected.
   Socialist national deputy Simon Lazara called the decree
``terrible.''
   ``Legally, it's an abuse. Politically, it's an illegitimite act.
And the date which the decree is announced is an act of
provocation,'' he said.
   The bombs caused no injuries and only minor damage to a Citibank
branch, an office of the conservative Union of the Democratic
Center, and a garbage truck that picked up a package at a
government office.
   Police deactivated a bomb planted outside the office of Perez
Compac, a shipping and banking company. No one claimed
responsibility for the bombs.
   Citibank and Perez Companc are preparing to buy the state phone
company as part of the government's privatization program. The
union representing the company's 47,000 employees opposes the
buyout, fearing it will lead to layoffs and cutbacks in wages and
benefits.
   The Union of the Democratic Center, which finished third in the
May 1989 voting that elected Menem, has strongly supported
privatization. In defiance of other Peronist leader, Menem
appointed several Democratic Center members to high office.
   To balance the budget and bring down inflation that topped 1,800
percent the past 12 months, Menem has fired public employees,
severely restricted wages and put dozens of state companies up for
sale.
   Many Peronists say his policies have betrayed the legacy of
party founder Juan Peron, who created or nationalized many state
companies during his 1946-55 presidencies.
   On Oct. 17, 1945, Peron was freed from prison after hundreds of
thousands of workers protested on his behalf. The next year, he was
elected president.
   Workers' right to strike is authorized in the constitution. But
Menem decreed that ``essential services'' - such as water,
electricity, hospitals, gas, phones, schools - may not be shut down
by strikes.
   Union leaders said the decree is unconstitutional.
   ``The restriction of the right to strike and the economic
program are like a person and its shadow because they support each
other,'' said legislator Jesus Rodriguez of the Civic Radical
Union, Argentina's second largest party.
   Saul Ubaldini, a strong opponent of Menem, was re-elected
Wednesday to head a confederation of workers representing more than
1 million teachers, state workers and metalworkers.
   Ubaldini led the powerful, 3 million-member General Labor
Confederation from 1980 until the federation split last October.
   Ubaldini led 13 general strikes against the 1983-89 government
of Menem's predecessor Raul Alfonsin of the Radical Civic Union.
   Menem claims to be unconcerned about the growing opposition to
his administration.
   ``Ubaldini ... can stage one or 1,000 strikes ... but the
government won't change its path,'' Menem said before departing
Wednesday on a 10-day trip to Italy, Poland and the Soviet Union.

   British women who approach the Iraqi embassy for
news of their husbands trapped in Iraq are being offered visas to
travel there, Joanna Copley, a member of the Gulf Support Group,
said Wednesday.
   She said she knew of two women who took up the offer of visas,
``although they may not actually go to Iraq.''
   Some news reports said up to 15 British wives plan on going.
   The Foreign Office said Wednesday it advised British women not
to go to Iraq.
   ``We believe this is simply a cynical propaganda ploy,'' a
spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``It is also
very dangerous.''
   Western men have been kept from leaving Iraq and occupied Kuwait
since the Aug. 2 invasion, but hundreds of women and children have
been allowed to go home.
   Ms. Copley said the Gulf Support Group, set up to help families
of those trapped in the Persian Gulf, was also advising women not
to go to Iraq because they may not be allowed to leave again, and
also because ``the Iraqis are bound to make propaganda out of it.''
   She said if wives took money into Iraq they would be breaking
United Nations sanctions imposed to protest the invasion.
   A man who answered the telephone at the Iraqi embassy would not
comment on the visa offer.

   Here is a comparison of some provisions in the
deficit-reduction bill passed by the House and a version being
debated by the Senate:
   GASOLINE: No change in the House bill. The Senate would raise
the 9-cent gasoline tax to 18{ cents per gallon by 1992 and the
15-cent diesel tax to 24{ cents. Neither bill would affect heating
oil.
   INDEXING: The House would forgo for one year the annual
adjustments to income tax brackets and personal exemptions, which
are designed to protect against inflation-caused bracket creep.
That would mean higher taxes each year in the future for all except
the wealthiest people. The Senate has no such provision.
   ALCOHOL: House: Raise the $12.50-a-gallon tax on 100-proof
liquor by $1, or 20 cents a fifth; double the beer tax to 32 cents
a six-pack; raise taxes on most wines, including, for example,
table wine, which would go from 3 cents a 750-milliliter bottle to
25 cents. Senate: Raise liquor $1.20; double beer; raise table wine
to 21 cents.
   TOBACCO: Both would raise the 16-cent cigarette tax by 4 cents
in 1991 an another 4 cents in 1993. Snuff, cigars and other
tobacco would face 25 percent tax increases each year.
   FLYING: Both would raise the 8 percent tax on airline tickets to
10 percent, eliminating the drop to 4 percent that was scheduled to
occur at the end of the year.
   TELEPHONES: The Senate would make permanent the 3 percent tax on
local and long-distance phone service, which is due to expire Dec.
31. Not in the House bill.
   LUXURIES: Both would impose a 10 percent tax on the portion of
the price of cars above $30,000; boats above $100,000; jewelry
above $5,000; furs above $10,000 (House) or $5,000 (Senate), and
private planes $100,000 (House) or $250,000 (Senate).
   TAX RATES: The House bill would raise the top rate paid by the
wealthiest people, now 28 percent, to 33 percent. It would impose a
10 percent surtax on those with taxable incomes over $1 million.
The Senate bill would do neither. The House, but not the Senate,
would raise to 25 percent the 21 percent alternative minimum tax
paid by some high-income people with large amounts of deductions
that otherwise would reduce their tax liability to near zero.
   ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS: The Senate would limit itemized deductions
(except those for medical expense, casualty losses and investment
interest) of people with adjusted gross income over $100,000. Only
95 percent of deductions would be allowed against the portion of
income above $100,000.
   CAPITAL GAINS: The House bill would allow a person to avoid tax
on half of up to $200,000 of capital gains earned in a lifetime;
the gains could come from most investments but not from stocks. A
person with annual income under $100,000 could avoid tax on another
$1,000 a year of gains, including those on the sale of stock. No
capital gain would be taxed at a rate above 28 percent. The Senate
bill has no capital-gains provisions.
   LOW-INCOME: Both bills would increase the earned-income tax
credit, which benefits low-income families with children, as a way
of offsetting some of the increased excise taxes. The Senate plan
also includes a major expansion of child-care benefits.
   MEDICARE TAXES: House would increase from $51,300 to $100,000
the maximum annual wage to which the 1.45 percent Medicare tax
applies. The tax is withheld as part of the Social Security tax.
The Senate would raise the limit to $89,000. The Senate would
require all state and local government workers and their employers
to pay the tax; the House would continue exempting workers hired
before April 1, 1986.
   MEDICARE PREMIUMS: House would raise the $28.60 monthly premium
for Medicare Part B insurance to $29.90 next year and $46.20 by
1995. Senate: $29.90 next year and $47.00 by 1995.
   MEDICARE DEDUCTIBLE: House would raise to $100 through 1995 the
present $75 deductible which beneficiaries must pay before Medicare
starts paying for doctor bills. Senate: $150 each year.
   SOCIAL SECURITY: Both would require all state and local
government workers who are not covered by a public retirement plan
to pay Social Security taxes.
   ENERGY INITIATIVES: The Senate bill earmarks $3.5 billion worth
of incentives for increasing U.S. oil and gas exploration and
production. The House does not.
   EXPIRING PROVISIONS: The Senate, but not the House, would extend
through 1991 at a five-year cost of $5.5 billion 11 targeted tax
breaks that are expiring. Principal beneficiaries include workers
who receive tuition aid or group legal services from employers;
businesses that hire the poor; investors in low-income rental
housing; self-employed who buy their own health insurance;
businesses that increase spending for research; and low-income
people trying to buy a first home.
   CONTRIBUTIONS: The Senate, but not the House, would permit
upper-income people subject to the alternative minimum tax to
deduct the current value of an artwork donated to a museum. Present
law allows them to write off only for the purchase price.
   BUSINESS: Both bills would raise taxes on life insurance
companies by $8 billion. They would extend for five years an
expiring 0.2 percent surtax that employers pay for unemployment
insurance. Senate, but not House, would prohibit corporations from
deducting interest paid on overdue taxes.
   MEDICAL DEDUCTIONS: The Senate, but not the House, would deny a
medical expense deduction for cosmetic surgery unless prescribed to
repair damage from an accident or a birth defect.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's special
envoy on the Persian Gulf crisis said Wednesday he remained
optimistic that Iraq might show some flexibility to avert war.
   The envoy, Yevgeny Primakov, commented after a 45-inute meeting
with President Francois Mitterrand.
   Primakov conferred Tuesday with Italian Prime Minister Giulio
Andreotti in Rome and is to fly Thursdaty to Washington to meet
President Bush and other American officials.
   ``I remain a prudent optimist,'' Primakov said after his talks
with Mitterrand. ``I think the Iraqi position could still become
more flexible.''
   Primakov visited Baghdad earlier this month and met with leading
Iraqi officials including President Saddam Hussein.
   In another development Wednesday, Defense Minister Jean-Pierre
Chevenement informed the Cabinet that France's forces in the gulf
were being reinforced, particularly its anti-tank capabilities.
   The Defense Ministry declined to give details of the
reinforcements, but said the French force in Saudi Arabia now
totaled about 5,000 men, up from the previously announced figure of
4,000.

   A Paraguayan opposition leader asked
Wednesday for the United Nations to send pollwatchers to May
municipal elections to verify that the country has entered the path
toward genuine democracy.
   Paraguay's U.N. mission said the government has not yet decided
if it wants independent election monitors from the United Nations,
Organization of American States, or other agencies.
   The May voting will be the first democratic mayoral election in
the country's history, and could provide the opposition with the
chance to strengthen its local organizations prior to the 1993
national elections.
   The Paraguayan military overthrew Gen. Alfredo Stroessner in
February 1989 and promised a return to democracy. Stroessner had
ruled since 1956.
   The vice president of Paraguay's Chamber of Deputies, Juan
Manuel Benitez Florentin, met Wednesday with one of the U.N.'s
chief officials for Central American affairs, Francesc Vendrell, to
ask for the election observers.
   Benitez said Vendrell told him the Paraguayan government would
have to make the request for observers, and make it forcefully
enough to persuade other nations to fund the request and send poll
watchers.
   Benitez said he stressed that it is essential there be
``cleanness and transparency'' in the local elections, or the
public might become disenchanted with the political process.
   ``Our entire political structure is no different than it was
under Stroessner,'' said Benitez, who is also president of the
Authentic Radical Liberal Party, a leading opposition party.
   Stroessner was ousted by his second-in-command, Gen. Andres
Rodriguez, who won a presidential election held only three months
later.
   Rodriguez has pledged to turn over the government to an elected
successor in 1993, but many are skeptical that the powerful army
and the official Colorado Party will relinquish power.

<TEXT>
   A critical meeting of Yugoslavia's
federal Parliament was postponed Wednesday and the defense minister
denied a military coup was planned if the legislature remained
split along ethnic lines.
   The postponment of the session until Friday, following a full
day of procedural wrangling, was seen by most observers as a clear
victory for the reform-minded republics of Croatia and Slovenia.
   The session was meeting to discuss whether Yugoslavia would
remain a federation, which Serbia advocates, or a loose
confederation, which Croatia and Slovenia back.
   The latest ethnic standoff had threatened to block the
parliamentary session, sparking a constitutional crisis and
deepening the political chaos menacing the country.
   The Parliament also voted 125 to 40 Wednesday to confirm Stipe
Mesic as Croatia's new representative on the federal presidency.
   Serbian deputies earlier threatened to refused to seat Mesic,
seen by many Serbs as a Croatian nationalist, as Croatia's member
in the eight-member presidency. Croatian deputies reacted by
warning they would walk out of Parliament.
   The Serbs were finally outvoted by a block of Slovenian,
Croatian, Bosnian and Macedonian representatives.
   Rising tensions betwen Serbs and Croats before Wednesday's
session sparked widespread rumors the army might seize power if
Parliament couldn't agree on the future relationship of the six
Yugoslav republics.
   Defense Minister Veljko Kadijevic described the rumors as
``nonsense.''
   ``They are nothing but vulgar provocations,'' Kadijevic told The
Associated Press after Wednesday's session.
   The respected weekly Danas in Zagreb on Monday quoted
unidentified sources as saying a coup was one option that already
had been discussed by top military officials.
   The army is multi-ethnic, but two-thirds of all officers are
Serbs, and more than 90 percent are or were members of the federal
Communist party.
   Vjesnik, the main daily in the republic of Croatia, called the
Parliament session ``the last poker game'' in the lengthy power
struggle over Yugoslavia's political future.
   Rising ethnic tensions already have resulted in clashes between
Croatian police and Serbs in Croatia.
   A confederation plan advocated by Croatia and Slovenia, where
center-right parties have ousted Communist governments in free
elections, is vehemently opposed by communist-ruled Serbia.
   Borisav Jovic, the Serb who currently holds Yugoslavia's
rotating presidency, is pushing a federal option that would keep
power centralized in Belgrade.
   The presidency deadlocked over the issue last week and held
stormy sessions Monday and Tuesday to try and forge a compromise.
   Janez Drnovsek, Slovenia's representative on the collective
presidency, walked out of the meeting Tuesday to protest the stance
of President Borisav Jovic, a Serb who holds the annually rotating
chairmanship of the supreme body.
   The state news agency Tanjug on Wednesday published what it said
was a plan for the future from the presidency, but the scheme
seemed likely to draw support only from Serbia and the tiny
republic of Montenegro.
   According to Tanjug, the plan foresees a bicameral Parliament,
with one chamber elected on the principle of ``one man, one vote.''
   Opponents say this would give Serbs, the largest ethnic group in
Yugoslavia with about 9 million people, a dominant say in national
affairs.
   The plan also foresees Yugoslavia remaining a federation and
accords member states the right to decide the fate or existence of
any provinces.
   That would give Serbia the right to abolish the province of
Kosovo, an ancient Serbian region now dominated by ethnic
Albanians.

<HEAD>35 Arrested as Peruvian Miners to Discuss National Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 35 miners were arrested Wednesday in
Morococha in central Peru on the third day of a strike by Centromin
workers. Miners decide this month whether to extend the strike
throughout Peru, union leaders said.
   Two union leaders were among those arrested, said Jorge Quesada,
chief of the National Federation of Miners and Metalworkers.
   The state-owned Centromin company said about 57 percent of its
12,000 blue-collar workers are striking. Most of the rest are set
to walk out Thursday.
   The workers want a 250 percent raise in their $3.50 daily wages,
the federation said.
   Union leaders said they will meet Oct. 25-27 to discuss whether
to call a national strike. Besides raises, strikers would demand
that mining companies recognize the federation as the miners' sole
representative in collective bargaining.
   Centromin produces most of Peru's silver and is the country's
second-top producer of copper.
   State railway workers stayed off the job for a third day
Wednesday. The railway handles 96 percent of Centromin's mineral
shipments.

<TEXT>
   Senate leaders Wednesday night scrambled for
support for a $250 billion deficit-reduction plan that would double
gasoline taxes, cut Medicare benefits and mildly boost income taxes
on the wealthy.
   The measure includes a broader-based tax increase than the
soak-the-rich House version that President Bush has said he will
veto.
   Democratic and Republican leaders spent much of the day trying
to line up enough votes to defeat what they called a killer
amendment that would strip the gasoline tax boost from the measure.
The amendment by Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho, would cost nearly $43
billion in revenues over five years.
   ``We're either going to come out of this exercise with a $500
billion deficit-reduction package, or with nothing,'' warned Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   As debate began, Democratic Budget Committee Chairman James
Sasser, D-Tenn., said, ``We tell the American people that there
will be some sacrifice in this package. But we tell them at the
same time that it will be fair.''
   And the White House said the Senate version could form the basis
for ending the government's long budget stalemate.
   ``The White House is ready to receive the bipartisan package
similar to the Senate package,'' said Bush's chief of staff, John
Sununu. ``Get it to the president's desk and he'll sign it.''
   The administration also saiil now, the president has tried to keep
the pressure on by
threatening to shut the government down unless Congress sends him a
full budget he can accept. Without emergency legislation, federal
authority to spend money expires at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.
   Acting one day after the Democrats pushed a bill much tougher on
the rich through the House, Senate leaders chose to face Election
Day just three weeks off with a proposal bearing all the marks of a
political compromise.
   There would be limits on deductions for people with incomes
exceeding $100,000, but no boost in tax rates for the rich as the
House approved. The 9-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax would be doubled,
but the earned-income tax credit for the poor would increase, too.
   The package would shave about $250 billion from the federal
deficit over the next five years by raising $142 billion in new
taxes and paring Medicare, farm support and other benefit programs.
Savings in other bills - mainly defense cuts - would bring total
deficit-reduction to about $500 billion, including $40 billion in
the budget year that started Oct. 1.
   Bush had threatened to veto the House bill because of its
increase in the upper bracket income tax rate. Though
administration officials objected to some provisions in the Senate
version, Sununu said in an interview on NBC-TV the president liked
the compromise.
   Despite the plan's powerful supporters, the Senate's Democratic
and Republican leaders spent the day defending their plan from
lawmakers unhappy for regional or philosophical reasons.
   Western senators complained that the higher gasoline tax would
be a severe blow to states such as theirs, where people routinely
drive long distances. Others insisted that the bill's overall tax
package was unnecessary, that spending should have been cut more
deeply instead.
   ``Grab your wallets and run for cover because Congress is
getting up a head of steam to raise your taxes,'' said Symms.
   Party leaders replied that with the economy teetering, everyone
had to pull together.
   ``I believe the deficit of the United States is so serious that
it isn't a Democratic issue or a Republican issue or the
president's issue,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, the
budget panel's ranking Republican. ``The people want us to do
something.''
   The starkest contrast between the Senate and House bills was in
how their pain would be distributed.
   The Senate measure would increase taxes on people earning more
than $200,000 by 3.7 percent, exactly half the burden the House
would impose. Those with incomes between $20,000 and $50,000 would
see their tax bills jump by nearly 3 percent under the Senate plan
but only about 1 percent with the House version.
   The Senate omitted the income tax increase from 28 percent to 33
percent that the House would impose on the wealthiest people. It
also excluded the moderate break in capital gains taxes that the
House would grant to middle-income people.
   Like the House-passed bill, the Senate version would increase
taxes on alcohol, tobacco, fancy cars, private airplanes and boats,
furs and jewelry.
   The Senate bill would gradually hoist the monthly premium
Medicare recipients pay for doctors' coverage from $28.60 this year
to $47 by 1995 - 80 cents higher than the House. The Senate would
increase the annual deductible beneficiaries pay, now $75, to $150
next year, compared to the House's $100.
   The Senate would also raise the wage cap from which the 1.45
percent Medicare tax is deducted from all paychecks from $51,300 to
$89,000. The House would push the cap to $100,000.
   Both bills would also reduce Medicare payments to doctors and
hospitals, the Senate's cuts totaling $34 billion. And both would
reduce support payments for farmers, student loans, and veterans'
benefits. They would increase the 8 percent airline ticket tax by
25 percent.
   Lawmakers would also raise fees for federal services ranging
from emissions testing of cars to bank insurance.

   Five environmentalists who spent the
night atop a pair of smokestacks climbed down and were arrested
Wednesday, ending a protest staged to warn of mercury contamination
from trash burning.
   ``We've made our point - we've made people aware,'' Greenpeace
spokeswoman Jeanne Whalen said. The group blames the giant
incinerators ringing the Everglades for high levels of mercury
found in fish and wildlife.
   The three men and two women sneaked into the Pinellas County
compound early Tuesday, scaled the 160-foot towers and unfurled
banners reading ``Don't Burn Florida'' and ``Mercury is Rising.''
   Sheriff's deputies arrested them on suspicion of trespassing and
released them on bond. If convicted, each faces a maximum $1,000
fine ad up to a year in jail, said sheriff's spokeswoman Marianne
Pasha.
   Plant manager Robert Stitz said the mercury emissions are within
safe levels. The ininerator burns 3,000 tons of garbage daily and
generates electricity.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Briton accused of being the ``fifth man'' in a
Soviet spy ring has characterized the allegations as false and a
publicity stunt, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
   Le Monde, a leading French daily, said one of its reporters
spoke by telephone with the accused spy, John Cairncross, at his
home in southern France.
   Cairncross, 77, said excerpts from a book by a KGB defector
accusing him of espionage were full of errors, Le Monde reported.
Excerpts from the unreleased book were published this week in the
Times of London
   ``It's nothing but a publicity campaign,'' Cairncross was quoted
as saying.
   The book, ``KGB: The Inside Story of Its Foreign Operations From
Lenin to Gorbachev'' by Christopher Andrew and Oleg Gordievsky, a
former KGB official now living in Britain, says Cairncross worked
for Moscow at the same time as spies Kim Philby, Guy Burgess,
Donald Maclean and Anthony Blunt. The book says Burgess recruited
Cairncross at Cambridge University.
   It alleges that Cairncross, while employed at the British
Foreign Office, and at the electronic eavesdropping center,
provided valuable information to Soviet intelligence.
   Cairncross was quoted by Le Monde as saying he knew Philby,
Burgess, Maclean and Blunt because they were contemporaries of his
at Cambridge University, but he did not know of their spying
activities until after it was revealed in the press.
   The book also said Cairncross, after he was interrogated by the
MI5 British counterintelligence service, confessed to passing
documents to the Soviets.
   It was not clear from the Le Monde article whether Cairncross
denied all espionage activity.

   The 21-member Arab League convened an
emergency meeting Wednesday night at the request of the PLO to
discuss responses to the killings of 19 Palestinians last week in
Jerusalem.
   According to some sources, the PLO was asking Arab nations to
raise $40 million to finance a general strike by Arab workers in
Israel.
   The league includes the PLO and 20 Arab nations, seven of which
sent their foreign ministers to the meeting. The others were
represented by the their Tunis-based ambassadors to the league.
   The PLO has denounced Israel for refusing to allow a U.N.
delegation to investigate the killings at Jerusalem's Temple Mount
on Oct. 8. Police opened fire after Palestinians threw stones at
Jews at the nearby Western Wall, or Wailing Wall.

<HEAD>City Impoverished But Proposed Budget Would Double Mayor's Salary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor of this impoverished city
has proposed 1991 and 1992 budgets that would more than double his
salary and those of other elected municipal officials.
   But Mayor Carl E. Officer said the proposals shouldn't be taken
too seriously because they will be revised extensively.
   ``I don't want anyone to take the figures we submitted overly
serious. It needs a lot of work,'' he said.
   Alderman Percy McKinney was one of those who didn't take it very
seriously.
   ``Sometimes you have to take a reality break,'' he said. ``This
is totally outlandish. We simply cannot afford that.''
   East St. Louis faces a debt estimated at $47 million. The city
has had trouble meeting its employee payroll and maintaining
municipal services.
   A judge recently gave away City Hall to pay a court award to a
man who sued the city. The man sold the property, and the city has
appealed the judge's original ruling.
   A $34 million bailout bill passed this summer by the Illinois
General Assembly created a state panel to oversee the city's
finances.
   Under the Distressed Cities Act, municipal officials had to
submit the budgets to the East St. Louis Financial Advisory
Authority by Monday. Officer met the deadline when he submitted the
two plans.
   ``The plans were not detailed. All I was simply trying to do was
comply with the statute,'' Officer said. Officer's salary under the
1991 budget would increase 107 percent, increasing from $30,000 to
$62,366. It would go up to $65,484 the following year.
   Treasurer Charlotte Moore's salary would jump from $25,000 to
$51,900 in 1991. The salary for that office would then increase to
$54,500 in 1992. City Clerk Alzada Carr would get a $24,200 raise
in 1991; her salary would increase from $22,500 to $46,700.
   A public hearing on the proposals is scheduled for Oct. 30.

   Kuwaiti refugees arriving at this
border crossing Wednesday said two car bombs exploded a day earlier
at a Kuwait City traffic circle traversed by Iraqi soldiers and
their families.
   The refugees, most of them families who left their country in
large, late-model cars, were arriving at this border post in a
steady trickle, about one car every 10 to 15 minutes.
   They repeated accounts from earlier refugees of Iraqi soldiers
invading Kuwaiti homes in the middle of the night, taking away
family members for questioning and stripping entire neighborhoods
of everything they could carry.
   ``They are Ali Baba and the 40 thieves,'' said Abdul Karim, a
consulting engineer who crossed the border Wednesday with a
colleague.
   ``I have never seen a ragtag army like this one,'' he said,
speaking in English. ``The Iraqi soldiers are looting, the Iraqi
civilians are looting, and then looters are looting the looters.''
   Karim and his colleague, engineer Abdul Aziz, said they reached
the scene of a booby-trap car bomb explosion Tuesday, just minutes
after it happened at a traffic circle heavily traveled by Iraqis
going to and from Iraq.
   They said three cars were destroyed and they were told there had
been casualties, although they did not see any.
   The two men said the explosion was the second they heard during
the day, but they had no details on the other blast.
   Some refugees have described continuing armed resistance by the
Kuwaiti underground, although the government-in-exile has said it
was scaling down the resistance to avoid reprisals by the Iraqis
against the remaining population.
   After invading Kuwait on Aug. 2, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
declared it Iraq's 19th province and began attempting to colonize
the country with Iraqis, according to accounts form the country.
The estimated 430,000 Iraqi soldiers and civilians in Kuwait are
said to outnumber native Kuwaitis.

<HEAD>Pakistan Government Hits Benazir Bhutto with Two More Charges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The caretaker government that succeeded
ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto filed two additional cases of
corruption against her on Wednesday, one week before national
parliamentary elections.
   Some legal experts expressed doubt that any of the six cases
against her, her husband and major members of her former government
will be completed before the Oct. 24 voting. Special one-judge
tribunals would hear the cases.
   A hearing was set for Oct. 20 by Justice Mohammad Amir Malik to
determine whether the 37-year-old Ms. Bhutto should stand trial.
   There was concern in Pakistan that the United States and other
Western countries would cut off millions of dollars in economic and
military aid if Ms. Bhutto is disqualified from running. But U.S.
influence here has become an election issue, and many fear she will
be disqualified as a snub to Washington.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed her 20-month-old
government on Aug. 6 as being so corrupt and incompetent it could
not effectively govern this Moslem nation of 110 million people.
Ms. Bhutto is challenging his decision in court.
   The new charges filed by the army-backed government accuse Ms.
Bhutto of using hundreds of millions of dollars in secret service
funds to buy political favors and of using government and military
aircraft to carry supporters in Parliament during a no-confidence
vote last year.
   Ms. Bhutto has denied any wrongdoing. If found guilty, one
result could be her banishment from politics for seven years.
   At least seven former Bhutto Cabinet ministers have been charged
with corruption before tribunals and more than 100 supporters in
her Pakistan People's Party have been arrested.
   Ms. Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, 38, is also accused in
the abduction of a Pakistani-born British man last April and is in
prison.
   His wife was allowed to visit him for two hours Wednesday, their
first visit since he was arrested a week ago.

<HEAD>Iranian Dissident Group Says Many Killed in Tehran Clashes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iranian dissident group said Wednesday
that moderates and radicals fought gunbattles last week in Tehran
and there were a number of casualties.
   The Iraq-based Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors, said
in a statement telexed from its Paris office that members of an
internal security committee fought with Revolutionary Guards,
Iran's main military force, last Thursday, leaving ``many
casualties on both sides.''
   The statement, quoting sources in Tehran, said the shootings
occurred in the capital's eastern Tehran-Pars district. It did not
provide a death toll, but said there were no civilians among the
dead.
   The statement added that in a similar clash last Wednesday, in
northern Tehran, ``a number'' of fighters on both sides were
wounded.
   The reports could not be independently confirmed.
   The statement from the Mujahedeen, Iran's largest opposition
group, said the confrontations were between supporters of President
Hashemi Rafsanjani, and his more radical opponents.
   The radicals, led by former Interior Minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi, and Ahmad Khomeini, the son of Iran's late spiritual
leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, are angered by their exclusion
from elections to a key constitutional body this month.
   Sources in Tehran reported fistfights in the parliament, or
Majlis, before the Oct. 8 elections, which hard-liners claim were
rigged.
   The Revolutionary Guards are loyal to Rafsanjani, while the
internal security committees back the radicals.
   Rafsanjani has been seeking to reestablish ties with the West
and attract investment and technology to revive Iran's sluggish
economy.
   The radicals believe Rafsanjani is straying from the ideals of
Iran's Islamic revolution, which rejected ties with the West.

<TEXT>
   Suspended Navajo Chairman Peter
MacDonald was convicted Wednesday of 41 counts of bribery and other
crimes for taking money and favors from business people operating
on the reservation.
   The same six-member tribal District Court jury convicted Peter
``Rocky'' MacDonald Jr., MacDonald's son and codefendant, of 23
similar counts.
   The prosecution contended MacDonald illegally asked for and
accepted cash payments, loans, airplane rides and use of an
automobile from businessmen seeking to curry favor.
   The defense argued during closing arguments Friday that
MacDonald got the gifts through friendship, that he hadn't
threatened the business people nor promised them anything in
return.
   The elder MacDonald was convicted of 41 of 42 counts of bribery,
conspiracy and ethics violations. Three counts against the
61-year-old former aerospace engineer were dismissed Friday.
   The younger MacDonald, an unemployed lawyer who lives in San
Jose, Calif., was convicted of 23 counts of bribery, theft by
extortion, ethics violation and conspiracy. Judge Robert Yazzie has
said he would consolidates the counts. If he does, MacDonald would
face a maximum of 10 years in prison.
   The elder MacDonald faces a maximum sentence of 21{ years in
prison and a $21,500 fine. The conviction bars him from holding
tribal office for four years. He is on the Nov. 6 ballot for tribe
president, a post that replaced the chairmanship.
   Sentencings were set for Oct. 22.
   MacDonald's attorney said his client would appeal. Rocky
MacDonald's lawyer said he probably would as well.
   Rocky MacDonald said he had no comment. But his father said the
verdict was no surprise. ``All along I've said the prosecutor is
snowjobbing the jury,'' MacDonald said.
   And as he left the courtroom, he said: ``I am the chairman of
the Navajo Nation.''
   About 180,000 Navajos live on the 21,100-square-mile
reservation, which covers parts of Arizona, Utah and New Mexico.
   The prosecution called 23 witnesses before resting its case
Friday. But defense attorney Val Jolley decided against calling any
witnesses, arguing that the prosecution failed to prove its case.
   ``Their case is in a shambles. We don't have anything we have to
defend,'' Jolley said Friday. ``The only time you have to present a
defense is when a case is proven beyond a reasonable doubt.''
   The trial is the first of three scheduled for the elder
MacDonald in tribal court.
   MacDonald was placed on administrative leave in 1989 by the
Tribal Council after allegations of corruption surfaced midway
through his fourth four-year term.
   The father and son's second trial is scheduled to begin Oct. 23.
It is on conspiracy charges stemming from the tribe's purchase of a
ranch for $33.4 million from a company which paid $26.2 million for
the property only five minutes earlier.
   The third trial, in which MacDonald faces 93 fraud counts
stemming from the tribe's 1986 primary and general elections, is
scheduled to begin Dec. 4. Suspended Vice Chairman Johnny R.
Thompson is a co-defendant.

<TEXT>
   Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald
Riegle attended a closed-door meeting Wednesday of the Senate
Ethics Committee to discuss his relationship with indicted thrift
owner Charles H. Keating Jr.
   Riegle, D-Mich., is one of five senators under scrutiny for
their ties to Keating and his Lincoln Savings and Loan, which
government regulators seized last year. The bailout, expected to
cost taxpayers at least $2 billion, represents one of the costliest
failures in U.S. banking history.
   The Michigan senator spent more than four hours in the committee
room and returned to the Senate floor without seeing reporters.
   He issued a written statement saying, ``I welcomed the
opportunity to meet directly with the Ethics Committee and review
with them all the facts in this matter. I know my conduct was
proper and I will await the judgment of the committee.''
   The Ethics Committee chairman, Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala.,
declined to comment. The vice chairman, Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H.,
said only, ``We're through with the senators,'' indicating the
committee planned no more interviews of the five senators.
   Earlier, committee member Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., told
reporters the panel should be ready to vote this week on whether to
continue investigating some or all of the five.
   In a statement issued later Wednesday night, the committee said
it would begin ``a series of deliberative meetings'' on the matter
Thursday. The committee said no statement would be issued ``until a
decision has been made.''
   The Ethics Committee has met separately with each of the
senators. Riegle is the last.
   The three-term Democrat from Flint has asserted repeatedly he
did nothing wrong.
   The public interest group Common Cause has accused Riegle and
the four other senators - Aan Cranston, D-Calif., Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz., John Glenn, D-Ohio, and John McCain, R-Ariz. - of improper
behavior in interceding with federal regulators on Keating's
behalf.
   Keating and his associates contributed $1.3 million to the
senators' campaigns and causes. The Ethics Committee is trying to
determine whether the donations motivated the senators to help
Keating.
   The senators say their actions were routine efforts to help a
constituent settle a dispute with the bureaucracy.
   Keating's failed thrift was based in Irvine, Calif., and its
parent company was in Arizona. But he had purchased and renovated
the Pontchartrain Hotel in downtown Detroit. In a letter to the
Ethics Committee on Oct. 18, 1989, Riegle said he had hoped Keating
would make further investments in the area.
   Keating hosted a fund-raiser for Riegle's 1988 re-election
campaign at the Pontchartrain in March 1987. A year later, Riegle
returned the $78,250 he received from Keating and associates,
saying he wanted to avoid an appearance of conflict of interest.
   The five senators met with several California regulators who
were investigating Lincoln Savings and Loan on April 9, 1987.
Riegle did not attend a meeting a week earlier between the other
four senators and Edwin Gray, former head of the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board.
   The Ethics Committee launched its investigation last December.
Sources have said Robert S. Bennett, its outside counsel, has
recommended dropping Glenn and McCain from the probe. But the
sources say Bennett believes there is enough evidence to continue
investigating Riegle, Cranston and DeConcini.
   The recommendation on Riegle apparently was based largely on the
fact that his meeting with the regulators occurred less than three
weeks after the Detroit fund-raiser, sources have said.
   Riegle's chief aide says the fund-raiser was scheduled months
before the April 9 meeting.
   Riegle has portrayed himself as having only minor involvement in
the Lincoln affair. In his letter to the Ethics Committee, he said
he attended the meeting at the request of DeConcini and McCain
because of his knowledge of the banking industry.
   ``At no time did I seek any meeting with regulators in Lincoln's
behalf or suggest any course of regulatory action with respect to
Lincoln,'' he said in a statement last October.
   But Riegle later acknowledged discussing the Lincoln situation
with Gray in March 1987. Gray has said that conversation led to the
two meetings between senators and federal regulators that are a
focal point of the controversy.

<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American and two Argentine
pathologists arrived here Wednesday to help identify the remains of
some of the 1,500 people secretly buried in a mass grave.
   Authorities uncovered the grave, in an unmarked section of a
cemetery outside Sao Paulo, while searching Sept. 4 for the bodies
of unidentified paupers who died in the early 1970s. By law, such
remains must be dug up and put in repositories.
   Most of the skeletons packed in blue plastic bags at the Perus
cemetery were those of indigents, but at least 50 were the remains
of political foes, dumped there by security forces during Brazil's
military dictatorship, authorities said.
   Military officials were given amnesty from prosecution for human
rights violations after they left power in 1985, and the
identifications will be used purely to help relatives confirm the
deaths of missing people.
   ``Our objective is to offer advice to our Brazilian colleagues
and some of the benefit of our experience obtained in Argentina,
where an equally tragic experience occurred,'' said forensic
anthropologist Clyde Snow, of Oklahoma City.
   Snowhas been working since 1984 with the Argentine Forensic
Anthropology Team to identify the remains of suspected subversives
who disappeared during the ``dirty war'' waged by Argentina's
rightist military from 1976-83. At least 9,000 suspected leftists
vanished and are presumed dead.
   Snow also was part of the international forensic team that in
1985 identified the remains of Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele in a
cemetery near Sao Paulo.
   Snow was accompanied by Luis Fondebrider and Alejandro
Inchaurregui of the Argentine team.
   A temporary forensic lab was set up at the Perus cemetery to
determine the age, sex and height of the skeletons.More detailed
examinations were to be carried out at the University of Campinas,
about 58 miles from Sao Paulo.

<TEXT>
   Syrian troops began withdrawing from the
Christian enclave of defeated Gen. Michel Aoun on Wednesday, and
the government froze the rebel officer's bank accounts.
   Witnesses said they saw a Syrian armored brigade withdrawing
from Aoun's former territory in the Metn mountains northeast of
Beirut. Police said government and Syrian troops also were leaving
the Christian heartland northeast of the capital.
   ``The combat is over. The forces that carried out the attack
were ordered to start gathering at key road intersections and
strategic locations,'' said a police spokesman, who could not be
identified under standing rules.
   The Christian general's 11-month mutiny against the government
of President Elias Hrawi was crushed Saturday by Syrian and
Lebanese troops. Aoun took sanctuary in the French embassy, and the
newspaper An-Nahar said it might take weeks or months for France
and Lebanon to reach agreement on his departure.
   The Lebanese Central Bank said it had carried out the
government-ordered freeze on Aoun's local accounts and was
arranging to block his access to deposits abroad.
   Banking sources quoted by the communist-run Voice of the People
radio station estimated the frozen assets at $100 million. The
figure could not be verified independently.
   Hrawi's government has said it wants Aoun tried on charges
including the alleged theft of about $75 million from the state
treasury.
   The unidentified sources quotedbby the radio said some of the
frozen funds were in the names of Aoun's two aides, Maj. Gen. Edgar
Maalouf and Brig. Gen. Issam Abu-Jamra.
   Also Wednesday, Hrawi sent his director of presidential affairs,
Mahmoud Othman, and six presidential guards to assume control of
the presidential palace in the Christian suburb of Baabda. The
55-year-old Aoun used the palace as his headquarters.
   The presidential palace was damaged in fighting between Aoun and
Syrian forces last year and in shelling duels with rival Christian
militia fighters of Samir Geagea this year.
   Repair work is expected to begin soon to enable Hrawi to occupy
the palace, traditional seat of the presidency.
   In Aoun's former enclave, an 80-square-mile area northeast of
Beirut that is home to 15,000 Maronites, bakeries and groceries
reopened Wednesday and residents began repairing damage caused by
the fighting.
   ``Life is gradually returning to normal. Civilians, who have
generally remained indoors since Saturday, started going out,'' the
police spokesman said.
   ``Winter is coming. I can't leave holes in the roof and glass
windows shattered,'' said Elie Sayegh, who lives in the Christian
suburb of Hadath east of Beirut.
   ``A tank shell demolished my car. It can't be repaired,'' said
Sayegh.
   Businessman Elie Yazbek was trying to rent a crane to get his
damaged car to a mechanic.
   ``It is badly damaged, but can be repaired,'' said Yazbek, 43.
``The car will have to be ready by next week. I'll have to drive my
children to school.''
   Hrawi plans to form a reconciliation government to reunify the
capital and implement a peace accord giving Moslems and Christians
equal power in Lebanon. The accord is aimed at ending the
15-year-old civil war.
   Aoun rejected the peace accord, largely because it did not set a
timetable for withdrawing Syrian forces.
   Syria, the main powerbroker in Lebanon, has had troops in the
country since 1976. The Syrians are considered an army of
occupation by many Christians.

<HEAD>German Official Arrested for Spying for Iraq</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A government official arrested earlier this
month for allegedly spying for Iraq supplied that nation with
secret U.S. documents on the Persian Gulf crisis, a newspaper
reported on Wednesday.
   On Oct. 2, the Federal Prosecutor's Office said a Foreign
Ministry official identified only as Juergen M.G. had been arrested
on suspicion of delivering confidential documents to Iraqi military
intelligence.
   Bild Zeitung reported the ministry official had informed Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein of ``every step of the U.S.A. and its
allies'' after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The official had ``access to the most secret sealed documents,''
Bild said, including information from NATO's headquarters in
Brussels and from the U.S. Ambassador to NATO, William Taft.
   The German official also delivered ``situation analyses'' drawn
up by NATO intelligence agencies, Bild reported, and informed Iraq
of cables sent to Bonn from German embassies in Israel, Jordan and
Baghdad, the newspaper said.
   Bild said the secrets were relayed via the Iraqi embassy in
Bonn.
   According to Bild, the alleged spy may have previously worked
for the former East German secret police. Bild said the official
was unmasked after a tip by a former East German intelligence agent
in Egypt.
   Asked to comment on the Bild report, Hans-Juergen Foerster, a
spokesman for the prosecutor's office, said it is still not known
exactly what the man had delivered to Iraq.

   Iraq refused permission for a mercy flight
to carry medicine into Kuwait to help Kuwaitis and foreigners
stranded there, U.N. officials said Wednesday.
   Kuwait's government-in-exile offered Friday to send a medical
flight to Kuwait, and asked Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar to make arrangements with Iraq for it to land.
   Iraq's U.N. Mission refused the request Tuesday, said U.N.
spokesman Francois Giuliani. He did not elaborate on Iraq's
refusal, but said Baghdad's position was well-known.
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, and subsequently announced it had
annexed the emirate and made it into the 19th province of Iraq.
   Other attempts by the United Nations to send missions into
Kuwait have been stymied by Baghdad's insistence that the mission
be understood as a visit to an Iraqi province, rathr than to an
occupied country.
   The United Nations has denounced the invasion in a series of
eight resolutions.

   Ethiopian Jewish leaders asked Israel and the
United States on Wednesday to come to terms with the Addis Ababa
government to save thousands of Jews stranded there.
   ``We are appealing to the American administration: for the sake
of human lives, forget the anger over the Ethiopians, talk to them
and convince them to release the Jews,'' Rachamim Elazar, secretary
of the Union of Ethiopian Immigrants, said on Israel radio.
   Ethiopian Jewish leaders in Israel say the African country's
Marxist government is blocking Jewish emigration to win military,
political and economic assistance from Israel.
   Ethiopia is torn by civil war and famine. Ethiopian Jews have
sought to escape to a better life in Israel, where 17,000 Ethiopian
immigrants have made their home.
   About 15,000 to 18,000 Jews remain in Ethiopia. About 8,000 were
airlifted to Israel in 1984 through Sudan.
   According to U.S. congressmen, Ethiopia is trying to force
Israel to sell it advanced weapons for use against the rebels in
the civil war.
   Ethiopia also is seen as wanting closer ties with the United
States.

<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal authorities are struggling to estimate
the size and reach of an elaborate credit card fraud scheme
masterminded by a murder convict from his prison cell.
   Daniel Neal Faries has admitted he used a telephone and computer
smuggled into his prison cell in Florida to purchase hundreds of
thousand of dollars worth of merchandise on other people's credit
cards.
   Later, he even built his own phone within the federal prison in
Chicago to continue running the massive credit card fraud ring
while he awaited charges of being a leader in the ring.
   In newspaper interviews and statements quoted in court records,
Faries claims he bribed two dozen prison guards with expensive
gifts, sent flowers and jewelry to his wife and even bought a se
of diamond-studded false teeth for a fellow inmate's mother.
   He is scheduled for sentencing Thursday in U.S. District Court
in Milwaukee. He faces five years on the fraud charge and has asked
the judge to give him the maximum so he can quickly return to
prison and start a new scheme.
   So far, authorities have tracked down $500,000 worth of
merchandise stolen through his credit card scam. But investigators
said Faries and a ring of up to 125 people could have illegally
charged millions of dollars more in merchandise to other people's
credit cards.
   The investigation could stretch on for years because of the
widespread activities of the ring and the difficulty in proving
that those who received gifts from Faries knew about his scam, said
Cliff Deckard, special agent in charge of the Secret Service in
Milwaukee.
   Nevertheless, the investigator said he hopes to indict 50 people
by next month. The identities of suspects have not been released.
The case is being handled in Milwaukee because some of the
fradulently merchandise was purchased there.
   Faries has admitted he began using other people's credit card
information about four years ago while he awaited trial on a murder
charge in a federal prison in Miami.
   Faries was later convicted and sentenced to life in prison.
   Over the past four years, Faries has confessed to sending cases
of wine, limousine service, gold coins, food baskets and jewelry to
friends and relatives while he was behind bars.
   He also said he bought Rolex watches and snakeskin boots for 24
guards at the Dade County Jail in Miami in exchange for access to a
computer.
   Faries said a guard smuggled in a laptop computer and telephone
in a laundry bag for him to obtain credit card information and make
his illegal charges to other people's accounts.
   After Faries was sentenced on May 1 to life in prison on the
murder charge, he was moved to Chicago's Metropolitan Correctional
Center to await trial on the massive fraud scheme he operated while
in the Miami jail.
   The switch to Chicago, however, didn't stop him from running his
credit card crime, he said.
   Prison officials in Illinois recently caught him with a
rudimentary phone he built by tapping into the prison phone wires
behind a metal plate in a jail room.
   He dialed out of the prison to a satellite dish by using his
electronic watch, he said.
   The tones of the watch, similar to those of a telephone,
connected him with a worldwide satellite communication system,
Faries said.
   From there, he said, ``I'm away. I can call anywhere in the
world - for free.''
   Faries brags he is a smart thief who reads books and magazines
while in jail to further his life of crime.
   ``I get all the rags,'' Faries said in a weekend interview with
the Chicago Sun Times. ``In Miami, I subscribed to everything up to
and including `Working Mother.' I liked the ads (for mail order
purchases) in there.''
   Secret Service officials on the case say they hope Faries'
sentencing on the credit-related charge bars him from phone or
computer use because he'll already spend his life in prison on the
murder charge.
   ``I'm not sure what effect a (jail) sentence will have on him.
That has been the problem to begin with,'' Deckard said.
   A sentencing in Milwaukee should not have been necessary, Faries
lawyer, Dean Strang, said.
   ``If he did what they say he did, it seems to me the most
practical way to handle this problem would be to take away the
telephone,'' Strang said.
   Prison officials in Illinois and Florida have refused to discuss
Faries case.

   An American allegedly involved in Britain's
largest robbery, the 1987 London safety vault heist, was extradited
to London from Israel on Wednesday, police said.
   Eric Rubin, 51, flew to Heathrow airport Wednesday from Tel
Aviv, accompanied by two British detectives, police said.
   Six men were jailed last year for the July 12, 1987, theft of
$59 million in cash, jewelry, works of art and other valuables from
the vault in the Knightsbridge area of London.
   Included in the haul was a 40-carat diamond, since recovered,
belonging to the wife of West German industrialist Gerd Rudolph
Flick.
   Italian Valerio Viccei was sentenced to 22 years in prison for
that and five previous robberies. Five others received sentences of
10 to 18 years.
   Rubin has been in custody in Israel since 1988, awaiting the
completion of extradition proceedings.
   Police also want to question Rubin about a 1987 robbery at a
London branch of the exclusive Coutts Bank, a spokesman said.

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Judds, an award-winning
mother-daughter country music duo, will call it quits at the end of
their current concert tour, they announced Wednesday.
   Naomi, 44, will retire from performing due to hepatitis, which
was diagnosed 10 months ago. Wynonna, 26, will start a solo career
with an album tentatively slated for a spring 1992 release.
   ``I have always told Wy and our fans the only thing that could
stop me from this career that I so desperately love would be my
health,'' Naomi said. ``Unfortunately, that has happened.''
   Their current tour is booked through Nov. 4 at Philadelphia, but
RCA spokesman Greg McCarn said additional dates were certain to be
set.
   ``I will miss touring and the daily interplay with our fans,''
said Naomi, who said she will continue writing songs.
   The mother and daughter announced their decision in a tearful
news conference at an empty Music Row building that formerly housed
RCA Records and where the duo auditioned seven years ago.
   The Judds were voted duo of the year for the third straight year
Oct. 8 by the Country Music Association. In their acceptance
remarks, both fought back tears as they credited each other.
   Their hit records over their six-year career include
``Grandpa,'' ``Mama He's Crazy,'' ``Why Not Me,'' ``Rockin' With
the Rhythm'' and their current ``Born to Be Blue.''
   Four of their eight albums have sold 1 million copies: ``Why Not
Me,'' ``Rockin' With the Rhythm,'' ``Heartland'' and ``The Judds'
Greatest Hits.''
   Wynonna said her first solo recording sessions would be after
the current tour winds up.
   ``The decision to begin a solo career has all happened so fast
because of Mom's health that I have not put a lot of thought into
it,'' she said.
   ``My main concern right now is Mom's welfare. However, I have
the complete support of my manager, my mother and others around me.
I certainly will give it my best shot.''
   Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. Symptoms include
weakness, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting and jaundice.
   Wynonna announced in July that she is engaged to songwriter Tony
King of Nashville.
   Naomi, a former nurse, married gospel music singer Larry
Strickland in May 1989. She was divorced in 1977 from her first
husband.

   Mormon Church President Ezra Taft Benson
was discharged from the hospital Wednesday, nearly a month after he
was admitted for treatment of blood clots on the brain, a church
spokesman said.
   Benson, 91, underwent two operations at LDS hospital for the
blood clots and later was treated for unrelated gastrointestinal
bleeding.
   Benson's daily schedule had been somewhat curtailed for the past
few years because of his age. However, he attended weekly meetings
of the Council of the Twelve and First Presidency in the Salt Lake
Temple before he was hospitalized. Church spokesman Don LeFevre
said doctors hadn't yet decided what activities Benson would be
able to resume.
   Benson was hospitalized Sept. 18 after complaining of severe
headaches and difficulty swallowing.
   He has been president of the 7.5 million-member Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints since 1985.

<HEAD>Rappaport Ahead in Spending on Senate Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican challenger James Rappaport has
poured personal loans into his campaign and is spending more than
Sen. John Kerry, finance reports show.
   Kerry, D-Mass., has spent $2.3 million this year on the
campaign, according to documents on file at the Senate clerk's
office and made public Wednesday. Rappaport has spent $2.4 million.
   Virtually all of Kerry's money comes from individual
contributions. Kerry refuses to accept money from political action
committees.
   Rappaport, as of Sept. 30, had loaned his campaign $2.25
million, or nearly 92 percent of the total he has spent this year.
   ``We're in the same ballpark with John Kerry,'' said Rappaport
spokesman Gary McMillan. ``He's collected more than $5 million over
the life of his Senate term plus $2 million worth of free franked
mail.''
   Any financial advantages of incumbency were offset by
Rappaport's ability to write his own campaign checks for millions,
said Kerry consultant Ron Rosenblith.
   The most recent polling conducted just after the Sept. 18
primary showed Rappaport trailing Kerry by just 4 percentage
points, making the race statistically even.
   The two candidates have aired television ads attacking their
opponent. Rappaport issued a widely noted ad showing a photograph
of the unpopular Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis fading into
a picture of Kerry. Kerry immediately shot back with an ad raising
questions about Rappaport's business dealings in Vermont and
Hawaii.

   People fell silent, church bells rang and
mourners heaped white carnations near the spot where a freeway
collapsed as Californians marked the first anniversary Wednesday of
Bay area earthquake.
   In West Oakland, grief mixed with celebration as about 200
residents of the drug-torn neighborhood gathered near the Cypress
Freeway, which collapsed and killed 42 people.
   Standing with rescuers, city officials and politicians, many
felt renewed pride as they recalled the efforts of neighbors who
scaled the rubble of the double-decked freeway to rescue trapped
drivers.
   ``A year ago today, we heard the loudest noise ever heard in
Oakland,'' said Paul Cobb, head of the Citizens Emergency Relief
Team, a volunteer neighborhood group. ``We saw neighbors grabbing
ladders out of their basements. Those who stood on corners with
nothing to do all of the sudden rose to the occasion.''
   The Oct. 17 quake, which measured at 7.1 on the Richter scale,
struck at 5:04 p.m. It killed 67 people.
   People across the nation knew something was wrong when the
television signal from the World Series was lost. The quake halted
the third game of the series between the Oakland Athletics and the
San Francisco Giants. The A's were again in the series - in
Cincinnati - and many spoke with quiet pride of the way
Californians helped the injured and rushed to rebuild.
   ``Those were some of California's most terrifying few seconds,''
Gov. George Deukmejian said at an earthquake conference in San
Francisco, that was also attended by Marilyn Quayle, the vice
president's wife. ``But they were followed by some of the finest
hours of our society.''
   Observances were held throughout the San Francisco Bay area. At
5:04 p.m., church bells tolled in the city and in Santa Cruz and
Watsonville. In those two two cities south of San Francisco, where
quake damage is still evident, mourners observed a moment of
silence.
   They fell silent, too, by the freeway in West Oakland.
   Richard Von Riddle, 34, of San Leandro, hopes a memorial will be
built to honor quake victims.
   ``There's 42 spirits floating down this strip right here,'' said
Richard Von Riddle, as he stood by the freeway. He hoped a memorial
would be built to those crushed.
   ``People lost their whole families,'' Von Riddle said. ``Every
time I go by, I start shaking and my heart breaks.''
   The remaining roadway that bisects the drug-infested
neighborhood of Oakland was renamed Mandela Parkway.
   ``There's been a very demonstrable renewal of hope in West
Oakland,'' said event organizer Jack Atkin. ``The earthquake was
staggering in its destructive power. God knows, there's enough
problems in West Oakland with or without an earthquake. But people
pulling together will get them solved much quicker.''
   At the Ferry Building in San Francisco, 1,000 people cheered as
the flag was raised for the first time since the quake. The
building's flagpole remained tilted long after the quake, and had
become for some a symbol of how far the recovery had to go.
   In Watsonville, where one person died, scores of residents took
to the streets to commemorate the quake. One group gathered for the
blessing of a new home, the latest to be rebuilt since the quake.
   Calls flooded into the AfterQuake Project in San Francisco, a
mental health hot line for people traumatized by the quake, after a
television station broadcast the number early Wednesday.
   ``A lot of people are feeling some anxiety about crossing the
bridge. They are looking at the weather,'' said counselor Alexandra
Charusofsky. The mid-day temperature Wednesday was 80 degrees,
about 10 degrees above normal. The day of the earthquake, the high
reached 83.
   At Candlestick Park, where the quake shook fans awaiting the
third game of the 1989 World Series, Mayor Art Agnos said the quake
``tested our preparedness, it tested our strength, and most of all,
it tested our character as a city and a people. We survived that
earthquake.''
   A French restaurant, L'Entrecote de Paris, organized a ``A
Celebration of Survival'' to recreate last year's impromptu
after-quake soiree that started when regulars begged the restaurant
not to close like others on the block.
   ``Some were frightened, some were laughing,'' said owner
Alexander Mortazavi. ``They were singing songs together. This whole
place became a party.''
   In seaside Santa Cruz, where blocks of downtown still show the
quake's destruction, residents were given the option of partying
into the night to the outdoor sounds of rock bands and ``earthquake
comedy,'' a free show by a group of San Francisco comics.
   ``The earthquake made you an instant native,'' said Bratton, a
member of the Downtown Association, one of the event organizers.
``The people who stayed are like veterans of a war, veterans of a
tragedy.''
   But nothing was scheduled Wednesday in the streets of another
hard-hit area.
   In San Francisco's Marina District, where the earthquake sparked
fires and destroyed homes, the tragedy still haunts residents.
   The Marina's anniversary events were scheduled before and after
the actual date to avoid a media onslaught.
   ``People here are trying to get through the day,'' said Maggie
McCall, publisher of the Marina Times, a neighborhood newspaper.
``We don't like to be inhospitable, but we don't like people
staring at us all the time. It's hard for a lot of people.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted Wednesday night to normalize
trade relations with Czechsolovakia for the first time since World
War II and dramatically reduce tariffs on its exports to the United
States.
   By a voice vote, the House approved a trade agreement signed
last April by the Bush administration and the newly elected Prague
government granting each other most-favored-nation trade status.
   Such a status qualifies the exporting country for the lowest
tariffs in effect on the goods it ships to the buying country.
   The agreement now goes to the Senate, where approval also is
needed before barriers to trade with the formerly communist ruled
Czechs can come down.
   Although the agreement was signed in April, President Bush did
not send the agreement to Capitol Hill for the required
congressional approval until last month.
   The accord will effectively reduce by 90 percent the tariffs
paid on some $82 million in Czech exports to the United States last
year and open the way for increased business ties between the two
countries.
   The effect will be to give Czechoslovakia a much broader U.S.
market for its exports by cutting their prices to wholesalers,
retailers and ultimately American consumers by as much as up to 40
percent.
   It also will open the Czech economy to more U.S. exports while
also protecting American companies' patents and copyrights.
   The agreement is the first U.S. bilateral trade accord with a
former Eastern Bloc country since the Warsaw Pact began collapsing
more than a year ago.

   Republican gubernatorial candidate Pierre
Rinfret claims his report of a 1977 trip to the Middle East
prompted Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's historic peace mission to
Israel.
   Cyrus Vance, U.S. Secretary of State at the time, on Wednesday
called Rinfret's claim ``rubbish.''
   Rinfret is challenging Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo's bid for a
third four-year term. A recent independent poll found Cuomo had a
45-point lead.
   Rinfret's August 1977 report, titled ``The Geopolitics of Israel
and Surrounding Arab States,'' discussed Israel's military
preparedness in case of war
   The report said Israel would try to destroy the economic base of
each enemy country and would target the Suez Canal, electric power
stations, factories and dams.
   Rinfret, an international economic consultant, said Israeli
secret service officials told him that the disclosure of Israel's
military intent convinced Sadat to visit Israel, according to
campaign spokesman Ted Kavanau.
   Sadat's surprise visit to Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin
in November 1977 led to the historic Camp David peace accord
between Egypt and Israel two years later.
   ``The Israeli secret service took the report and gave it to
Sadat,'' Kavanau said. ``When he got it - this is Pierre Rinfret
talking - he made the decision instantly to go to Israel.
   ``The Israelis were using Rinfret to deliver a message to the
Egyptians that they would fight,'' Kavanau said.
   Vance said Sadat decided to visit Israel on his own.
   ``I was in very close touch with Sadat all along and Rinfret was
never mentioned,'' said Vance, a New York City attorney who served
during the Carter administration.
   Sadat and Begin shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978.
   Sadat was assassinated by Moslem extremists in 1981. Begin, 77,
resigned as Israeli prime minister in 1983.

   Five years ago, Ohio voters approved a
bond issue to find ways to clean the state's high-sulfur coal and -
in the process - save the jobs of miners like Jerry Back.
   Some $85 million later, Back is anything but reassured.
   ``I've got 15 years here, and I'd hate to see it go down the
drain,'' Back said as he prepared for the start of the second shift
at the Meigs No. 2 mine. ``I think in five years, we may be
working. But I don't think we'll be working after five years.''
   Ohio's high-sulfur coal, once burned in many of the region's
electrical power plants, fell into disfavor in the 1980s amid
rising concern about acid rain pollution. State officials, seeing
the market diminish, asked voters in 1985 to approve a $100 million
bond issue to back research projects aimed at finding a way to
remove some of the sulfur.
   While officials say the research is promising, the solutions may
not gain widespread commercial acceptance in time to save many Ohio
mines and the jobs of 6,700 miners.
   ``I'm a coal miner, but I'm a person, too,'' said miner Bill
Oiler. ``If there is a problem out there, we do need to find a
solution. But the solution is not to just do away with jobs. We
need to find technology to alleviate the problem.''
   Ohio Coal Development Office chief Jacqueline Bird said her
office has disbursed about 85 percent of the money raised through
the 1985 bond issue. Some of the projects will soon enter
large-scale testing, while others remain on the drawing board.
   ``If there were a quick, easy solution, God knows we would have
done it by now,'' Ms. Bird said. ``We're trying to find the
permanent solution. If there were a short-term answer, we would
have landed on it.''
   Ohio coal is abundant - the OCDO estimates a 200-year reserve -
but it is loaded with sulfur, which combines with oxygen during
burning to form sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide combines with
hydrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid.
   Typical Ohio coal has a sulfur content of about 3.5 percent;
most utilities need coal with sulfur content below 0.7 percent.
   The federal government has steadily tightened sulfur dioxide and
nitrogen oxide emission limits, and even more stringent limits are
pending in Congress. As the limits have shrunk, so have Ohio coal
sales and mining jobs.
   Even Ohio's own utilities and mills burn more coal from out of
state than in-state mines. Last year, less than 46 percent of the
coal burned in Ohio came from within the state, U.S. Department of
Energy figures show.
   But it takes as long as 25 years for a technology to move from
concept to commercial acceptance, Ms. Bird said. Each stage must be
tested and the next step revised on the basis of earlier findings.
   And even when the technology is proven, it takes time for the
industry to trust it and invest millions of dollars in plant
renovations, she said.
   Ohio doesn't lack ideas. At Lorain, it is testing a process that
burns limestone along with coal to absorb sulfur dioxide.
   At a plant in Brilliant which was shut down in the 1970s because
of the cost of complying with clean air laws, they're turning water
to steam by burning a mix of coal and sorbent, which reacts with
and captures sulfur.
   The steam drives a turbine and creates electricity. But the
gases from the burning are cleaned of sulfur and then used to
create electricity in a second turbine. Remaining hot gas is used
to heat fresh water headed into the boiler.
   But Jack Segall, U.S. Department of Energy deputy assistant
secretary for coal technology, said there are no rewards for taking
risks in new technology.
   ``If the cost of producing electricity as a result of this new
technology goes down, it's the ratepayer who gets the benefit,'' he
said. ``If the technology does not work, it's the utility that gets
penalized.''
   President Bush's clean air plan includes incentives to encourage
use of clean coal technologies, Segall said. But it's still not
clear what choice utilities will make, he said.
   And in the meantime, ``we hold our breath and hope we can make
it,'' Ms. Bird said.
   ``In Ohio, if the Clean Air Act amendments don't change
substantially from where they are now, the large (mining) companies
will be able to make it, and so will some of the medium-sized
companies,'' she said. ``You'll probably see more mergers between
medium- and small-sized companies - and some companies will go
under, unfortunately.''
   The best hope is to accelerate the pace of clean coal technology
development, Ms. Bird said.
   ``The problem now is people are saying, `Well, you've been in
existence in five years, why isn't it solved?' It's the perception
that if you throw enough money at it quickly, that'll do it,'' Ms.
Bird said.
   ``But you can't push science and technology along that fast. You
can accelerate it, but you can't make it meet false deadlines.''

   John Wayne rode into America's heart as a
white-hatted tamer of the West. But some historians say if the
truth had found its way into those old Westerns, Wayne would have
worn a black hat.
   ``There's really kind of an insult to Indian people in that
notion of white person stands at Mississippi River and looks into
the horizon and says, `It's open. It's free. It's mine,''' said
University of Colorado history professor Patricia Limerick.
   ``Certainly, historically people did that. But I don't see any
reason why the historians should echo the point of view of one of
the participants. To have your vanity, your self-image or your
pride rest on an untruth is not good for individual mental health,
national mental health.''
   Limerick, 39, is a New West historian - a breed of Western
historians who see the pioneers as exploitive conquerors who
damaged the environment with their unrestrained hunting, trapping
and mining.
   The ranks of the New West historians include Limerick, Howard
Lamar of Yale, Donald Worster of the University of Kansas and
others. They say traditional Western history omitted the tragedies
and the contributions made by Indians, Hispanics, French trappers,
Chinese, blacks and women.
   ``When the dust settled, the invaders had more power and the
natives had less,'' said Limerick, whose book, ``The Legacy of
Conquest: The Unbroken Past of the American West,'' is written from
the New West viewpoint.
   Not everyone agrees with the revisionists. A.B. Guthrie, author
of ``The Big Sky,'' and University of Wisconsin history professor
Alan Bogue believe the they tend to overemphasize the negative side
of the West's settlement.
   ``Life is hard everywhere. Inequalities are forever,'' Guthrie
wrote recently in Nieman Reports. ``The revisionists' wide-eyed
discovery of them in the West strikes me as a bit naive. It is the
blind cruelties of life on this planet that have led man to invent
heaven.''
   Most Americans learned about the settlement of the West from the
writings of Frederick Jackson Turner, a Univesity of Wisconsin
history professor who influenced historians for more than a
century.
   In the late 1800s, Turner made the Anglo-American settler the
focus of his account of the West's settlement. These settlers were
depicted as having given up comfortable homes to start new lives in
an unforgiving wilderness, free to anyone brave enough to tame it.
   Turner also is credited with formulating the ``frontier
thesis,'' which said the frontier that set Americans apart from the
rest of the world closed in 1890. U.S. Census data was cited.
   His premise laid the groundwork for the belief in a uniquely
American pioneer spirit that authors and presidents have invoked to
inspire a nation. Limerick said a recent poll of teachers of
Western history showed 87 percent used Turner's theses as the basis
for their courses.
   ``Turner and his students and his generation tended to see the
Western experience as something that was extremely impressive:
People marched across the continent and turned it into homes and
industries in a relatively short time,'' said Bogue.
   ``There were always underlying stories that were something we
couldn't be nearly as proud of perhaps ... Turner's version of the
West was what he and his generation saw in it.''
   The New West historians believe Western history should be
written as a continuous story, not with a division between the 19th
and 20th centuries.
   Without such an arbitrary dividing line, the California Gold
Rush of 1848, for example, could be tied into 20th century mining
booms in which the same land, water and environmental issues
recurred.
   Because the two centuries usually are treated as two separate
eras, textbooks that may address California economics and
demographics usually fail to show how they relate to the state's
history, said Clyde A. Milner II, a Utah State University professor
who is editor of the Western Historical Quarterly.
   New West history is ``a developing trend over the past 30 years
that now is reaching a critical mass,'' Milner said.
   Critics argue that New West historians find too much fault in
Turner's work, which was well-accepted at the time.
   ``They are overemphasizing the unfortunate results of the
Western movement ... It gave millions of people the opportunity to
provide for new lives,'' said Bogue.
   ``One I don't think can be criticized too harshly for saying,
`Hey look, it really does look as if an era is ending.' People of
that time thought so.''
   Limerick blamed the stagnation of U.S. historical theory during
the post-Turner era on historians trapped by his definitions of the
frontier. They drove ``themselves into a cul-de-sac and then became
stymied,'' she said.
   As the historians debate, the new ideas are gaining acceptance
in a wide arena, with a growing emphasis on specialized history
whose focus ranges from the environment to cultural diversity.
   In addition, the more realistic views are gaining a foothold in
literature, from the popular Southwestern Indian mystery novels of
author Tony Hillerman to a $12 million ABC-TV mini-series about
George Armstrong Custer, based on author Evan S. Connell's ``Son of
the Morning Star.''
   But the New West historians face an uphill journey to conquer
all the myths, as witnessed by the popularity of Larry McMurtry's
novel, ``Lonesome Dove'' and the subsequent TV mini-series, she
said.
   There is a place for the romantic tales of the Old West that
made John Wayne famous, ``as long as we let it have as much power
as we think it should have ... we ought to be aware of where the
(movie) screen is and where we are.''

   Leaders of the nation's two biggest religious
bodies, the Roman Catholic and Southern Baptist churches, are
protesting proposals to cut tax deductions for charitable
contributions.
   Scores of other voluntary agencies also are opposing the move.
   Monsignor Robert N. Lynch, general secretary of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, said, ``Weakening the incentives
for contributions would not only be counter-productive but
contradict the repeated calls by President Bush for increased
involvement by the non-profit private sector in addressing needs of
the less fortunate in our society.''
   Kay S. Dowhower, director of the governmental affairs office for
the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, noted individuals
contributed $96 billion in 1989 to various causes serving public
purpose.
   ``In fact, the charitable contribution tax deduction may indeed
be one of the biggest bargains in the federal budget,'' she said,
adding: ``Do not bite the hand that feeds so many.''

   GENEVA (AP) - Hailing the re-unification of Germany, the Rev.

at a period when your country needs you most.''

   MEXICO CITY (AP) - A Canadian television news anchor says
journalists should broaden the definition of news beyond disasters
and conflicts to ``embrace inspiring news that promotes dignity.''
   Kevin Evans, an anchor for the CBC in Vancouver, British
Columia, said at a Lutheran-sponsored international conference on
communication that unpleasant news and conflict should be reported
not as entertainment ``but to provoke thought, to challenge.''

   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) - For the second time in a year, an
American Indian has been elected an Episcopal bishop. The Rev.
Steven Charleston, 41, an Oklahoma-born Choctaw, was elected bishop
of Alaska.
   Another American Indian, Bishop Steven Plummer, was elected a

Farmington, N.M., covering Navajo reservations in Arizona, New
Mexico and Utah.

   NEW YORK (AP) - American Orthodox rabbis have designated
Saturday ``a Sabbath of Protest'' against what they called the
``unjust and immoral'' United Nations condemnation of Israel for
the violence in Jerusalem in which 19 Palestinians were killed.
   ``This hypocrisy of the U.N. is not unusual,'' but the United
States joining in the condemnation vote is ``alarming,'' declared
Rabbi Marc D. Angel, president of the Rabbinical Council of
America. ``The U.S. has betrayed Israel.''
   The Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish
Organizations said the ``blatant provocation and premeditated act
of violence'' in which Palestinians hurled rocks at Jewish
worshippers was instigated by PLO leaders to divert attention from
the Persian Gulf crisis and divide Arab states.

   HORSLEY'S GREEN, England (AP) - Representatives of various
agencies involved in Bible distribution say the world has ``a
greater openness and hunger for the word of God than ever before in
history.''
   Saying that use and familiarity with Scriptures had dimished in
industrial countries, the Bible organizations urged churches to
``make the Scriptures central to their worship and ministry.''
   The 12 Bible organizations, holding their first joint meeting
Oct. 2-5, said in a statement:
   ``Christian missions often carry out their evangelistic task
without using the distribution of Scripture as an integral part of
their outreach, thereby neglecting to provide their personnel with
the tool most crucial to their ministry.''
   The agencies include the United Bible Societies, Wycliffe Bible
Translators, International Bible Society, Bibles for the World,
Bible League, Institute for Bible Translation and Pioneer Bible
Translators.

   Mimi Rogers sees a gleam of hope that women
may one day achieve equal status in today's macho movie world.
   ``It's an unfortunate fact that there are many more roles for
men than there are for women. A favorable sign is the success of
films like `Pretty Woman' and `Ghosts' - much more successful than
big, male-dominated action films,'' she said.
   ``With these two films, in which women are on more of an equal
level, being so successful, maybe the trend will start to shift in
the direction of having men and women really co-starring.''
   Upcoming movies seem promising: Cher and Winona Ryder co-star in
Orion's ``Mermaids,'' a sweet relationship movie; Michelle Pfeifer
co-stars with Sean Connery in ``The Russia House,'' based on the
John le Carre thriller; Julia Roberts stars in next spring's
``Sleeping With the Enemy''; and Academy Award-winner Jody Foster
is eagerly awaited as the star of ``Silence of the Lambs,'' a taut
thriller based on the best seller by Thomas Harris.
   If not equal, Rogers has a vital role in ``Desperate Hours,''
with Mickey Rourke and Anthony Hopkins. It's Dino De Laurentiis'
update of the 1955 movie, with Rogers in the part originated by
Martha Scott. Rourke plays the Humphrey Bogart role of a criminal
psycho who takes a suburban family hostage. Hopkins has the part of
the husband, originally played by Fredric March.
   The director of the MGM release is Michael Cimino. Yes, the same
Michael Cimino who won an Academy Award for ``The Deer Hunter'' in
1978, and made the financial bomb ``Heaven's Gate'' in 1980.
   Rogers remarked that during the ``Desperate Hours'' filming
Cimino ``was very relaxed, very much at ease and enjoying the whole
process. There was an awareness on his part that he wanted to bring
it in on time and on budget. I think we actually finished a week
early and under budget.
   ``He knows that he knows how to make movies. There's no question
the guy has made some brilliant movies. It's more a matter of
reaffirming that he can do it, that he can follow a schedule and a
budget, that it's no problem and boom - there's the movie. That's
what he did.''
   Rogers has three new films: ``Desperate Hours''; ``The Doors,''
Oliver Stone's biography of rocker Jim Morrison; and ``The
Rapture,'' an apocalyptic drama. Last January, she and Tom Cruise
ended their three-year marriage, during which she seemed to be
subordinating her own career as his zoomed skyward.
   She corrected that impression: ``I actually worked quite a bit.
Unfortunately, two of the films that I did haven't been released in
this country.
   ``I did a picture for Vestron called `Hider in the House' (with
Gary Busey) that got caught up in the company's bankruptcy. Then I
did a film with James Belushi called `To Forget Palermo.' We spent
14 weeks shooting that. It was an Italian-financed film - an
English (language) film with an Italian director. That's always a
bit of an experiment,'' she said.
   ``I don't know what happened to it. Maybe American distributors
looked at it and thought it wasn't going to make money. Both of
those films, I think, have been released internationally but not
here. So there's an apparent void that didn't really exist.''
   Like her former husband, Mimi (short for Miriam) Rogers had a
traveling childhood. Both their fathers were engineers who took
jobs all over. Rogers was born in Coral Gables, Fla., but she moved
to Virginia, Arizona, Michigan, England and finally Los Angeles. A
good student, she graduated from high school at 14, and started
acting in her 20s. Her first film was ``Blue Skies Again'' with
Harry Hamlin.
   Her other co-stars include Michael Keaton (``Gung Ho''),
Christopher Reeve (``Street Smart''), Tom Berenger (``Some to Watch
Over Me'') and Denzel Washington (``The Mighty Quinn'').
   She usually plays ``the love interest.'' But she hopes that will
change as movies take a feminine tilt.

<HEAD>Jewish Refugees Play Extras in Film About Escape From Denmark</HEAD>

   For three of the Danish film extras
playing Jewish refugees waiting to be shipped to safety in Sweden,
the scene gave them an eerie feeling of deja vu.
   Oskar Kaznelson and his wife, Bella, and Hans Goldstein were
among 7,200 Jews smuggled out of German-occupied Denmark in small
boats to neutral Sweden under the noses of the Gestapo during the
autumn of 1943. Another 464 members of the community were not so
fortunate. They ended up in a German concentration camp.
   Forty-seven years after their dramatic night escape, the
Kaznelsons and Goldstein once again were being bundled into fishing
boats, standing by to make the risky 10-mile dash across the
Oeresund strait to the Swedish coast.
   But this time they were only playing a scene in a movie, and the
gun-wielding youths hustling them below decks were actors playing
Danish resistance fighters.
   ``A Day in October'' began filming at the end of September and
is to be finished in November. The script was largely inspired by
Leo Goldberger's book, ``The Rescue of the Danish Jews - Moral
Courage Under Stress,'' and is being done in English.
   For the Kaznelsons, their roles brought back memories of their
own flight from Denmark in September 1943 when they were smuggled
out of Copenhagen.
   Oskar and Bella Kaznelson were engaged to be married when on
August 28-29 1943 there was growing civil unrest in Copenhagen and
the Germans took over. The couple fled Denmark on Sept. 12, paying
the equivalent of about $1,000 each to be smuggled to the Swedish
port of Malmoe.
   ``When we got to the Swedish side, the first thing that happened
was that we were thrown in jail,'' said the 71-year-old Kaznelson.
It wasn't until Oct. 1, 1943 that Sweden began accepting Jewish
refugees from abroad.
   After they became legitimate refugees, Oskar joined the Danish
Brigade, a group of refugee Danish military officers, policemen and
resistence fighters. Bella went to her parents in Gothenburg. They
returned to Denmark on liberation day May 1, 1945. Bella is now a
dental assistant, and Oskar is sells equipment for the building
industry.
   Goldstein, now a public accountant, came to Denmark from Vienna
in 1938. His mother died in Auschwitz, his father survived one of
the camps and went to the United States. Goldstein escaped to
Sweden by boat, spent two weeks in a refugee camp there and
returned in June 1945. He had intended to go to Palestine, but was
prevented at the time because of the political situation in the
area. So he married a Danish woman and settled down in this
country.
   ``The movie is basically the story of a young Danish resistance
fighter who falls in love with a Jewish girl who is being pursued
by the Gestapo,'' said Damian Slattery, the American screenwriter.
   The fictional plot is set against the authentic historical
backdrop of occupied Denmark, he said.
   Goldberger's book contains contributions by American and Danish
historians and witnesses of the events in Denmark in 1943. He is
the Danish-born son of the former cantor of the main synagogue in
Copenhagen, and escaped with his family during the October boat
lift.
   ``The Danes made a fantastic effort. They stood together, they
were deeply offended by the deportations and they were able t say
what they thought about the Germans,'' Goldberger said.
   D.B. Sweeney (``Gardens of Stone,'' ``Eight Men Out'') plays the
Danish underground leader, and actress Kelly Wolf portrays Sara
Kublitz, the hunted girl. Wolf co-starred in ``Triumph of the
Spirit,'' about the plight of Jews in war-torn Europe. Daniel
Benzali and Tovah Feldshuh play her parents.
   The movie is directed by Kenneth Madsen, a Dane who has won a
Clio Award for his commercials and is making his feature film
debut. It is produced by Just Betzer, who made the Academy
Award-winning ``Babette's Feast,'' and French videomaker Philippe
Rivier.

<HEAD>Term Limits: More Popular as a Concept than a Practice</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As political punishment, the drive to limit
lawmakers' terms and tenure can send them a message without getting
personal. And even disenchanted voters seem to prefer it that way.
   The upstart issue of this campaign, term limits are gaining
endorsements from some candidates who see them as hostile to the
establishment and to incumbents, few of whom are likely to be
ousted by the voters.
   Term limits offer a way out for voters who tend to favor their
own representatives, while complaining about what is happening at
the State House or the Capitol.
   ``People say, `I like my legislator, but not the legislature,'''
said John Keast, who tracks referendum issues for the conservative
Free Congress Foundation. ``Term limits are a concept rather than a
candidate. It's much easier for people to handle.''
   A Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted Oct. 14 makes the
point in numbers: 63 percent of those surveyed said they
disapproved of the way Congress is doing its job - and 64 percent
said they approved the performance of their own House member.
   Despite the voter dissatisfaction reflected in polls, neither
party expects major changes in Congress in the Nov. 6 elections.
   Only two states, California and Colorado, will be deciding in
this election whether to restrict terms in office. Oklahoma already
has imposed a 12-year limit for state legislators, effective Jan.
1. That measure was approved by two-thirds of the voters in a Sept.
18 primary election. Polls reflect majority support for the other
two state measures, but there is an intensive, well-financed
campaign against the California limits.
   It would take a broadened movement with staying power to apply
term limits in a way that would force real changes from a system in
which incumbency, and the seniority that comes with it, usually
rule.
   Vice President Dan Quayle sees that coming. ``The voters are
channeling their discontent into real and lasting reform,'' said
Quayle, who is pushing term limits as he campaigns for Republican
candidates.
   ``The people are restless,'' Quayle said. ``This new wave of
cynicism has been building for a long time. It should not be
discounted. Clearly, term limitation is an idea whose time has
come.''
   President Bush says he's for term limits, noting that the
Republican platform advocates them. While Bush hasn't stressed it
as an issue, GOP gubernatorial candidates have in states like
Texas, Florida, California and Georgia.
   For example, as he campaigned with Bush in Dallas on Monday,
Clayton Williams said that if he is elected governor, he will push
a constitutional amendment for term limits. ``The people in Texas
are fed up with the politicians in Austin,'' Williams said.
   Opponents of term limits argue that career bureaucrats and
special interests would become stronger than they already are if
legislatures were stripped of their veteran lawmakers.
   They complain that term limits are an anti-democratic measure
because they restrict the choices available to the voters.
Advocates concede that point, but say it's a price worth paying for
change.
   While there is some Democratic support for term limit measures,
it makes more sense for Republicans. The GOP would benefit from
turnover, especially in the House, which has been run by Democratic
majorities for 36 years.
   A constitutional amendment proposed in the Senate early this
year would impose a 12-year ceiling on senators and House members,
but it is not going anywhere in Congress. So supporters are trying
to build pressure in the states. Resolutions advocating
congressional term limits have been proposed in at least 29 state
legislatures, adopted in only two.
   Colorado's state measure also would impose a 12-year limit on
service in Congress, a provision that certainly would face
constitutional challenge in the courts.
   But measures that apply only to state legislatures could
eventually turn up the pressure for action to limit congressional
tenure too.
   ``People rightfully feel that entrenched legislators are only
interested in getting re-elected, and I do not think the movement
to limit terms will stop at the state level,'' Quayle said in
Louisville, Ky., last week.
   He said it should be extended to cover the House and Senate,
where he served 12 years. His first speech as a congressman from
Indiana in 1977 was a call for federal term limits. It had been one
of his campaign themes in 1976, when he upset a veteran Democrat.

   When Dale Randolph's organization decided nine years ago to
translate the Bible into modern Russian, he had no idea how it
could be useful to the Russian people since their country then
barred importing Bibles.
   But that project of uncertain ends has turned out to meet a
surprising and newly expanding purpose.
   ``When we started, I didn't have the slightest idea what we
could do,'' he said. ``In those days, it was illegal even to walk
around the streets of Moscow with a Bible.''
   Despite the uncertainty, the translation work went ahead simply
``in faith,'' without any known, feasible usefulness, he said.
   But by the time the seven-year job was finished in 1988, he
said, ``the doors had swung wide open'' to an immense, pent-up
Russian yen for Bibles, a yearning now being served by Randolph's
group and other American organizations.
   Like others, ``I didn't have any idea the situation was going to
change,'' he said in an interview. ``The only explanation is that
someone other than us was watching over this. Our ministry has been
blessed over and over in incredible ways.''
   Randolph, president of the World Bible Translation Center in
Fort Worth, Texas, said a printing of 100,000 of its New Testaments
was scheduled for completion in Moscow on Saturday and would be
sold through Soviet bookstores.
   Printing of an additional 300,000 copies was contracted with a
Grand Rapids, Mich., plant as the first part of a goal of 1 million
copies to be given free to Russians by year's end. Plans call for
handing out a million complete Bibles next year.
   They will be distributed partly through a branch ``Bible
Center'' opened in Moscow this fall as part of the Kuntsevo
Cultural Center.
   ``The demand for Bibles is just incredible,'' said Randolph, who
has made five trips to the Soviet Union this year arranging the
project. ``When freedom came, it was like a dam had been broken,
and the desire came gushing forth.
   ``The people have been totally starved for the Bible. They've
been starved for information about God. Everyone in that country is
wanting to know what Christianity is about, from government on
down.
   ``They want to look at what it says about family life, about
alcoholism and other problems, to see its answers to life. There is
a tremendous hunger for it. The opportunities over there are just
benumbing.''
   Other agencies also are swelling the flow of Bibles to the
Soviet Union, including the American Bible Society in which most
denominations participate and the Evangelical Publishers
Association in a special ``Moscow Project.''
   Those Bibles, however, are in the 17th century Russian
``synodal'' translation, as traditionally used by the Russian
Orthodox Church and other Russian-language churches.
   ``We're the only group providing a modern Russian translation,''
Randolph said. ``We're shooting at the masses. It's not so
necessary to reach church people as to reach the man in the
street.''
   Randolph's organization, which also produces modern translations
in other major languages and a simple-English version for the deaf,
said two key principles are followed - that the rendering be true
to the original Hebrew and Greek and ``be easily understood in the
target language.''
   Started in 1972, the center is associated with the Churches of
Christ, for which Randolph formerly was a missionary in Greece. The
staff of about a dozen includes three scholars in Greek and Hebrew,
who oversee adherence of the modern-language translations to the
original meanings.
   Shortly after the center completed its Russian New Testament,
Randolph got a first-hand sampling of the Russian appetite for
Bibles at a Moscow book fair in September 1989.
   His booth's supply of 10,000 copies was exhausted in one
morning, and for the next day and a half, names and addresses were
taken of 17,000 other Muscovites wanting Bibles. These later were
sent.
   The center since has completed the entire Bible in modern
Russian.
   Randolph said much of the change in the Soviet Union ``has its
roots in religious desires, in a hungering of citizens in that
country and most of Eastern Europe to know more about God.''
   ``Everthing points to a surge forward of Christianity in that
country,'' he said.
   He said that with the Soviet Union moving toward capitalism, the
people may seek to find their answers to life in Western
materialism. But there also is a powerful religious base despite 70
years of Communist efforts to eradicate it, he said.
   ``The Russian Orthodox Church is at a high point of its
existence,'' he said, adding: ``The Soviet Union very well may
provide a major thrust to Christianity in the years ahead.''

<HEAD>Chevrolet Caprice: Size and Comfort in a New Design</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto, Graphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Look out, here comes the boat - no, the 1991 Chevrolet Caprice.
   Look at how it floats across those bumps in the road. Look how
those six adults pile in easily on the cloth bench seats front and
rear. Look at how the golf clubs, the suitcases, the carts full of
groceries all disappear into the massive trunk.
   It's like looking at a part of Americana. There just aren't many
big autos like this left.
   Big Chevrolets have been part of the General Motors Corp. fleet
for decades. Since the 1950s, sales of the middle-America,
bread-and-butter cars have totaled more than 38 million.
   For 1991, GM has redesigned its Caprice and looks for sales of
about 200,000 units compared with 150,087 in 1989. Already this
calendar year, the new Caprice, which debuted in April, is helping
boost sales more than 8 percent above last year's pace.
   The design and engineering changes include a 5-liter V-8 engine
as standard, teamed with a four-speed automatic transmission. The
package delivers 170 horsepower and provides for a maximum 5,000
pounds of towing capacity, up 1,000 from the 1990 Caprice. The
previous model's 4.3-liter V-6 engine has been dropped.
   The V-8 performed well in the test drive, though I could feel
the shift points during demanding acceleration. Chevrolet reports
the Caprice can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 10.5 seconds - a
respectable showing for a car this size. So was fuel economy at 17
miles per gallon, city; 26 on the highway.
   GM also boosted safety features in the redesign, installing a
driver-side air bag and four-wheel antilock brakes as standard
equipment.
   Suspension provided by four-wheel coil springs was on the mushy
side during the test drive, giving a floating feeling as the car
hit potholes and bumps on the streets.
   Outside, the Caprice is rounded, both front and rear. The rear
wheel fenders are skirted, adding to the sloping, aerodynamic look.
The styling helps take the edge off the largeness of the car, but
once you're inside and driving, you're reminded that it's a big
automobile: I nearly backed into another vehicle the first time in
reverse, being unused to having so much car back there.
   Inside, there's ample room for six adults. Chevrolet added 3
more inches of shoulder room and 2 more inches of hip room. Because
the car retains its rear-drive configuration, the middle person in
back must contend with the mid-floor hump.
   But even with the front seat all the way back and reclined a
bit, I could stretch out my legs. The rear shelf below the back
window also was one of the largest I've seen.
   The trunk, with 20.4 cubic feet of cargo space, is so monstrous
that a small person might have to climb inside to reach the spare
tire. Chevrolet wisely designed the lid so that items do not have
to be lifed up and over the body, just over the bumper.
   Exterior fit and finish was good, though on the test car some of
the trunk lining was not attached on one side.
   Caprice buyers typically have ``a fond place in their hearts for
a full-size Chevy,'' said company spokesman David Hudgens.
   Target buyers for the 1991 model will be younger than previous
buyers, who averaged about 62 years of age, Hudgens said. Many past
buyers have been retirees, and they used their Caprices for social
and recreational trips.
   ``They're in their middle years and they have time to travel,''
Hudgens said. ``They want comfort and space.''
   Today, the company hopes to get more buyers who are in their 40s
and 50s, who will use the car for commuting to work, too.
   Base price for the test car was $16,515. Competitors include the
Ford Crown Victoria, which starts at more than $16,600; and the
Chrysler New Yorker, which starts at more than $19,000.
   Consumer Reports magazine lists 1983-85 Caprice models as
average in owner reports of trouble. The 1986 model was ranked
worse than average and the 1987-88 models were listed as much worse
than average.
   Hudgens said Chevrolet is always trying to improve quality and
that production plants are working to get reliability and
durability to a world-class level.

<HEAD>New Group Offers Hope for Lima Street Kids</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By MIKE DeMOTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The street kids of Lima are called
``piranhas,'' for the Amazon fish that can strip a swimmer of flesh
in minutes. They swarm over victims in packs, snatching wallets,
purses and jewelry.
   Freddy lives in University Park, downtown Lima. His clothes are
torn and dirty. He has a long, deep, red cut on his right ear, but
no open sores on his face like some of the others.
   He is 11 years old. Like the other kids, Freddy sniffs glue to
get high or quiet his hunger.
   Hundreds of children roam the garbage-filled streets of Lima,
willing even to sell their bodies for enough to buy some food and
glue. Without help, most probably will die soon or end up in Peru's
infamous prisons.
   ``Many of the kids have venereal disease, some have AIDS and all
of them have some kind of skin infection,'' said Dwight Ordonez,
head of a project called Ninos de La Calle (Street Kids) that is
trying to help.
   Peru is in its worst economic crisis and thousands of children
hustle a living on the streets of Lima, a city of 7 million.
   Children of 5 or 6 hawk cigarettes, shine shoes or wash cars.
Most go home at night, even if home is only a shack.
   For the hundreds of ``piranhas'' there is no home. They live in
parks, plazas, on the river bank behind the Government Palace.
   Packs of them roam La Parada, a huge food market frequented by
drug dealers and prostitutes, and Kennedy Park in Miraflores, a
district of nightclubs and luxury shops.
   The city operates five youth shelters, there are several
orphanages and the police have two juvenile detention centers, but
the number of children on the street indicates the old system
doesn't work.
   Ninos de La Calle is part of the private, U.S.-financed Center
of Information and Education for the Prevention of Drug Abuse. It
takes a different approach because ``we are convinced the normal
way of working with street kids fails,'' said Ordonez, 30, who has
a master's degree in psychology.
   He said the traditional way is to confine the children, beat
them and impose overly strict rules.
   Ordonez said Ninos de La Calle homes are like ponds next to a
river, where the piranhas can swim in, stay awhile and swim out.
House rules are fairly simple: No stealing, fighting, breaking
things, drugs or sex.
   Ninos de La Calle has two homes and is building a third. About
55 boys have continuing contact with the group.
   The project was born in June 1989. Ordonez and other team
members spent three months in the streets studying homeless
children, and were horrified by what they saw.
   Lima's street kids, all boys and aged 10 to 16, run in
loose-knit gangs of 30 to 50, Ordonez said. All sniff glue, he
said, and about 10 percent smoke ``pasta basica,'' semi-processed
coca leaf from Peru's Amazon jungle.
   Project workers won the confidence of the boys, who generally
are aggressive and anti-social, by organizing soccer games.
   Once exposed to the homes set up by Ninos de La Calle, many
decided to stay. They even chased away other piranhas who tried to
lure them back onto the street with promises of drugs.
   The homes' biggest attraction seems to be a sense of belonging
to a group where someone cares.
   Ordonez said most of the boys were from poor families, but
divorce and abuse drove more of them into the streets than poverty.
   ``What they need more than anything else is to talk, but it's
what they do least,'' said Eduardo Villanueva, 29, a psychologist
who has been with the project since it began.
   One of Villanueva's boys at Miraflores house is Carlos, a lanky
16-year-old with a shy smile. When they first met, Villanueva said,
Carlos was always high on glue and had trouble speaking.
   ``When I was sick, they helped me,'' Carlos said of Ninos de La
Calle. ``When I wanted to leave, they invited me to stay.''
   After two months at Miraflores, Carlos has begun attending a
nearby public school, where he is about five years behind other
boys of his age. He said he wants to learn accounting and work in a
bank.

<HEAD>Ortega: Revolution Still Possible Despite Collapse of Socialism</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Daniel Ortega, who won international
respect by accepting an election defeat, says revolution in Latin
America may survive the collapse of European communism, but not if
its leaders cling to dogma.
   Nicaragua's former president said in an interview that injustice
and poverty still are problems in the region, providing the fodder
of revolution.
   At 46, with a decade of leadership behind him as head of the
Sandinista National Liberation Front, Ortega has abandoned the
olive fatigues and black-and-red bandanna of his guerrilla days and
years in power. President Bush once compared the outfit to a Boy
Scout uniform.
   Ortega cultivates a youthful image, dressing in jeans and
colorful shirts, and remains politically active in Nicaragua and
abroad. Young admirers pursue him for autographs when he appears in
public.
   His acceptance of the February election loss to Violeta
Chamorro, Nicaragua's new president, improved his image in the
world. At home, Ortega has reined in the more radical elements of
the Sandinista National Liberation Front.
   A combination of Ortega's influence and two crippling strikes
led by the Sandinistas persuaded the new government to retain many
Sandinista programs, including land distribution.
   ``The reality of Nicaragua is that no one can govern without the
FSLN'' he said, using the initials of the Sandinista Front.
   ``I am sure that our talks with the government and our attempts
to reach a consensus have angered some people inside the
government, but we think common sense is prevailing.''
   Elements of Mrs. Chamorro's fractious coalition accuse her of
weakness for dealing with the Sandinistas, who are by far the
largest party in Nicaragua and want to be consulted on important
economic decisions.
   The Sandinistas oppose such austerity measures as currency
devaluations, reductions in the public payroll and selling
nationalized industries back to private investors.
   Ortega works for the party and travels abroad seeking foreign
aid for Nicaragua.
   He said being out of office allows him more time with his eight
children, but that they interfere with a book he is writing on the
years in government.
   Wealthy nations are focusing on their own concerns at the
expense of Latin America and other poor regions, Ortega said.
   ``We will now see an industrialized North, including the former
Socialist countries, that will determine the dstribution of the
world's technological resources,'' he predicted. ``The problems of
the Third World will continue. The industrialized countries of the
North have no time to consider our economies or problems in the
South.''
   U.S. economic assistance to Mrs. Chamorro's government has not
met Nicaraguan expectations. About $65 million in cash has been
provided since April and an additional $40 million is promised in
credits for agricultural development.
   ``The collapse of the Eastern Socialist bloc gives the United
States the hegemonic control that always was its objective in Latin
America,'' Ortega said. ``The policies of assistance of the
Socialist bloc . . . disappear and they are not compensated by the
United States or other industrialized countries.
   ``This places Latin America at a disadvantage. It does not help
our countries. The need for revolutionary change remains.
   ``We still have a revolutionary movement in El Salvador, and
Brazil can explode, too. We have armed groups in Peru and Colombia.
What happened in the East does not improve the living conditions of
people in the South.''
   Washington no longer can accuse all revolutionary movements of
being communist, Ortega added, and ``at the same time, the
revolutionary movement must rethink the kind of projects and
programs they want. In the past there was a tendency to
dogmatism.''
   ``Our revolution was never subordinated to the Soviet Union,''
he said. ``They offered their support after the victory.''
   ``The United States must show respect for Latin America if it
wants a world of peace, and Latin America must increase its
contacts with sectors of influence in the United States that . . .
know the rich will sink if the needs of the poor are not
satisfied,'' Ortega said.
   Of Nicaragua's future and the Sandinista role in it, he said:
``We realize this government came to power with the help of the
United States. We accepted the challenge in the elections.
   ``But the Nicaraguan revolution's changes brought on by the
Sandinista Front remain.
   ``Now the party must change, and adapt to the times. Neither the
structure nor the programs of a party are immovable. We now need
other forms, although the objectives of ending human exploitation
and the principles of justice remain.''
   ``We still have a lot to do to emerge from the crisis,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Networks To Share Election Night Exit Polls, Projections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The television networks' race to announce who
won on election night is over. And the winner is ... VRS!
   VRS?
   This year, for the first time, ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN have put
together a single organization - Voter Research and surveys, or VRS
- for exit polls and projections. This means two things: The
networks will save money, and the main competitive aspect in TV
election coverage is gone.
   ``Of course it's being changed; no question,'' said Warren
Mitofsky, executive director of VRS. ``But now I think the networks
have an opportunity to compete on a much better playing field.
   ``Instead of competing about who can come up with numbers first,
they can compete on their news coverage. They have a good chance to
do their analysis, their interpretation of what it means, and a
good presentation.''
   VRS will cost each member $3 million through the 1992 fall
elections, said Mitofsky. The networks won't say how much they're
saving with VRS, but they use the word ``substantial'' most often
in their descriptions.
   ``In this age, nobody wants to lose a lot of money on news, and
elections never paid their way,'' said Mitofsky, who led CBS's
election unit for 20 years. ``The commercial revenue from election
night maybe paid less than a third of the cost. This was a very
expensive proposition without much return.''
   For $3 million, each network gets exit polls and projections for
all Senate, House and governor's races. And they get the same
information on a selected few state and local races of national
interest, like the Washington mayor's race and California's
propositions.
   ``The numbers will be the same, but how we interpret that
information, how we use it, will be different,'' said Mary Klett,
NBC's director of elections and polling.
   VRS has about 55 people working on the 1990 elections, with a
permanent staff of about half that, Mitofsky said. VRS absorbed
many of its people from CBS' election unit and layoffs from other
network election units.
   In hindsight, the broadcast networks' decision to form VRS seems
almost inevitable, given that since 1985 all three have changed
hands or leadership. At CBS under Laurence A. Tisch, at the merged
Capital Cities-ABC Inc., and at NBC under General Electric, the
mandate has been to cut costs.
   The new arrangment does nothing to prevent any or all of the
networks from projecting the winner of a presidential election
before polls close in the West; Mitofsky said the only long-term
solution to that problem is a federal, uniform poll-closing law.
   Mitofsky said the old-style competition wasn't more accurate
than VRS. All three tended toward more than 99 percent accuracy.
With less pressure to be first, the process should be even more
accurate, Mitofsky said.
   ``One of the criticisms of what we're doing is that there'll be
no way to correct mistakes,'' said Mitofsky, who for two decades
headed CBS' election unit. ``This is absolute nonsense.''
   Projections derive from three statistical models. The first and
fastest is the exit poll, interviews with voters who have cast
their ballots.
   Then comes the key precinct model, precincts which historically
have reflected larger voting trends. And finally there is the
county model, where projections are based on actual raw vote
totals.
   ``When you get all done with the three sources of projections,
you then end up with the tabulation of the vote,'' Mitofsky said.
``This is a self-correcting process. I don't need to get a phone
call from NBC to tell me when I've made a mistake.''
   Creating VRS has not been painless. Negotiations began after the
1988 elections and concluded only in February of this year. The VRS
questionnaires were designed by negotiation among the network
election units.
   Above and beyond that basic service, VRS participants can buy
``unilateral'' polling and projections. CBS, with The New York
Times, has done exactly that, arranging for an independent poll of
voter attitudes.
   There is a precedent for VRS: the News Election Service, the
vote-counting pool established by ABC, CBS, NBC, United Press
International and The Associated Press in the late 1960s.
   ``VRS is a collection agency and provides only one projection,''
said Carolyn Smith, head of ABC's election unit. ``VRS provides no
analysis. It is up to the individual network to make the proper
conclusions and interpretations of the exit polls.''
   ``The stuff each network puts out should be more interesting,''
she said, ``because we've been able to spend more time figuring out
what we're going to do with this information, instead of being
constantly pressured to be `firstest with the mostest.'''
   ``I assume that the other networks have their own resources and
may very well come up with their own conclusions, even to the
extent that we may be using a common pool of exit polling,'' said
Marty Plisner, executive political director for CBS News and a VRS
project overseer.
   ``The four different networks each have their own style, own
people, own signature and, to a considerable degree, their own
following,'' Plisner said. ``You'll know whether you're watching
CBS or NBC,'' he said. ``Beyond that, there's a lot more to an
election than who won and what time you know it.''
   The most obvious change for viewers should be the way networks
announce the projections. Mitofsky said he has asked the networks
to credit VRS. ``I told them they should,'' he said. ``I'd like to
think that they will.''

   For Boston waitress Nancy Wilson, tables are
empty, tips are smaller and taxes are higher.
   ``I'm an angry voter,'' she says.
   She is not alone; throughout the recession-struck Northeast,
voters are rebelling against ballooning budgets and taxes as the
Nov. 6 elections approach.
   Already, they have drummed out an old generation of political
incumbents, some - like Democratic governors Michael Dukakis of
Massachusetts, William A. O'Neill of Connecticut and Madeleine
Kunin of Vermont - without even casting a ballot. All retired
rather than face the wrath of the voters.
   ``The economic bowling ball has rolled through the Northeast and
many political leaders have gone flying,'' says Lee Miringoff,
director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion in
Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
   What's more, voters in Massachusetts are so mad they are
reviving the tax revolt that began in California in the 1970s and
spread to Massachusetts in 1980. Voters then radically slashed
property taxes levied by town governments and Propositions 13 and
2{ became household words.
   This time around it's known as ``Question 3,'' a referendum that
would roll back increases in the state income tax and some fees
imposed over the past two years and eliminate hundreds of new items
and services added to the sales tax.
   ``The message nationally if (it) passes is that the tax revolt
is still alive and well ... even in liberal Massachusetts,'' says
William Schneider, a political analyst with the American Enterprise
Institute in Washington and a visiting professor at Boston College.
   ``With the deficit crisis in Washington, politicians, even
President Bush, assume you can pass new taxes and voters will
understand,'' says Schneider. ``So what they're debating is who
pays, the middle class, the rich, how the tax burden is
distributed. The message will be, `not so fast.' The voters may not
be reconciled to tax increases even in the midst of a fiscal
crisis.''
   The Northeast elections promise to be among the nation's most
exciting because of the tax revolt, tough economic times, tight
races and the emergence of a new generation of politicians who
campaigned as ``outsiders.''
   And the election could serve as an informal Democratic
presidential referendum for Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York and U.S.
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey. Both are expected to be re-elected
over weak challengers, but both must win by comfortable margins wo
keep their political options open.
   Cuomo, seeking a third, four-year term, appeared most vulnerable
this year. New York's credit rating dropped to the third worst in
the nation, only a step above Massachusetts and Louisiana. Cuomo
and the state Legislature approved a budget that included a record
$1.8 billion tax increase.
   Still, ``As the bowling ball rolled through the Northeast, Mario
Cuomo has remained standing very firmly,'' said Marist College's
Miringoff.
   He said that although Cuomo is not as popular as he was four
years ago, he is still within striking distance of his record 65
percent of the vote in 1986. His opponent, Pierre Rinfret, has run
a bumbling, ill-financed campaign.
   This is not a good time for the Northeast. Unemployment rates
exceed the national average. Bankruptcy filings and welfare
applications have doubled and tripled. Banks have failed. The real
estate market has collapsed. Problem loans and repossessed real
estate have nearly doubled, to more than $36 billion.
   Sales tax and other collections fell short of projections,
yielding large budget deficits, tax increases and more layoffs.
Massachusetts alone had a record deficit of more than $1 billion in
the last fiscal year.
   Three months into the new fiscal year, the budget is still
running astray, forcing Dukakis to cut spending by another $500
million - all of this in stunning contrast to the ``Massachusetts
Miracle'' that Dukakis boasted of in his failed quest for the
presidency.
   ``It was a miracle that it lasted as long as it did because of a
lack of real leadership,'' says Gary Arnold, the owner of Process
Control Industries, Inc. in Taunton, a city 35 miles south of
Boston whose economic decline was reversed during the boom years.
   Process Control Industries had 200 employees on its payroll 18
months ago. The work force has been cut in half and Arnold says the
company is in a position to move almost at any good opportunity.
   ``The cost of staying in this state is a key issue,'' Arnold
says. ``Obviously that's taxes. I sure hope the state gets managed
a lot better. There's no attraction to stay here.''
   In September's primary, Arnold and other voters ousted
Democratic incumbents linked to the Dukakis administration.
Instead, as an independent, he cast his ballot for the Republican
gubernatorial candidate, William Weld, who beat his own party's
endorsed candidate.
   Weld, a former assistant U.S. attorney general in the Reagan
administration, is in a close race with the Democratic candidate,
John Silber, who is on leave as president of Boston University. He,
too, defeated the party's endorsed candidate, campaigning as an
outsider.
   Weld supports the tax rollback. Silber opposes it.
   Supporters say the Dukakis administration increased state
spending by 92 percent during the last seven years, almost three
times the rate of inflation, and left Massachusetts with the
sixth-highest tax burden in the nation.
   Opponents say the measure would devastate the economy, rolling
back $1 billion already collected and spent and costing the state
more than $2 billion in the next fiscal year.
   Domenic Bozzotto he broke ranks with the AFL-CIO and threw the
support of his 5,000-member Local 26, Hotel Workers Union of
Boston, behind the tax repeal referendum. Even more startling was
the union's endorsement of a Republican candidate, Weld, for the
first time in its 103-year-old history.
   ``We never endorsed a Republican candidate for anything, not
even dog catcher,'' said Bozzotto, the president of the union.
``Our members and their spouses work two, three, four jobs. An
average hotel worker probably makes somewhere around $17,000 to
$20,000 a year. If they work one job, clearly they can't survive.
If we don't grab these guys by the throat at the Statehouse and
make them accountable, it will just be business as usual.''
   That same sentiment is echoed in Vermont, where Kunin's
predecessor, Republican Richard Snelling, is the favorite with a
campaign pegged to the state's faltering economy. He blames Kunin.
   And in Connecticut, the Democratic Party's two-decade hold on
the governor's office is in jeopardy because of the fallout from
two years of tax hikes totaling more than $1 billion. The favorite
is Lowell P. Wiecker Jr., the former Republican U.S. senator who is
running as an independent.
   Voters in New Jersey have much outrage but little outlet for it.
A $2.8 billion tax increase that has made Democrat Jim Florio one
of the most unpopular governors in the nation.
   Florio does not come up for re-election for another three years,
and the Democratic Legislature also has a free pass this year. The
state constitution has no provision for referendum or recall of
elected officials.
   Bradley's Republican opponent, Christine Whitman, has tried to
direct some of the anger at Bradley, demanding that he take a stand
on the state tax issue. But Bradley has refused.

<HEAD>^BOO! A Halloween Treat: TV So Bad It's ... HORRIBLE!!!</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Happy Halloween, viewers. Our topic is bad
television. Television that does not create a burden on the
viewer's wit and intellect, but induces a vaccuum. This is TV so
bad it's ... scary.
   ``Aaaggggghhhhhhhhh!!!!''
   Please. Save your screams for the end.
   We're talking about TV that represents deformities in the
national character; TV that speaks of profound Problems in the
Republic.
   When future historians close the books on our era, they may
forgive American culture for the aberrant values implicit in ``The
Beverly Hillbillies.'' They'll probably call it ``classic
television;'' the French will honor ``Gilligan's Island'' as a work
of genius.
   It already is happening:
   ```Green Acres' isn't stupid, it's surreal!'' gushed cable's
Nickelodeon channel in plugging its revival of the show.
   That's the strange thing about bad television. It is preserved
in reruns until the dignity of age and nostalgia accrete to it.
Mediocre TV sinks without a trace; bad TV becomes a ``cultural
artifact,'' a precious relic of bygone days.
   Precious relics of the '70s and '80s?
   Here's a bottom 10 list, in ascending order of horror:
   
   10. ``THREE'S COMPANY'' - From midseason in 1977 to 1984 this
show epitomized the central values of the 1970s, much like disco
and leisure suits. It was, and is, appalling.
   The premise, if that is what it can be called, was that two
women and one man (Suzanne Somers, Joyce DeWitt and John Ritter)
were capable of hilarious sexual tension and innuendo while
chastely sharing an apartment.
   This menage was acceptable to the Ropers, their virtually
impotent landlord and his sex-starved wife, who labored under the
misapprehension that the male tenant was homosexual. A laff riot!!!
   The writing was as predictable as the tides, the conflicts were
trivial, the humor sophomoric, and the acting ludicrously bad to
non-existent. At a loss for comic ideas, the writers would have
Somers sunbathe. When in doubt, jiggle.
   The show wrecked Somers' career after she made salary demands
inconsistent with the producers' estimate of her worth. John Ritter
may recover. Joyce DeWitt is a future trivia question.
   And, it is said, there is always an episode of ``Three's
Company'' playing somewhere.
   
   9. (tie) ``THE LOVE BOAT'' and ``FANTASY ISLAND'' - ``Mind
candy'' was how these hour-long ABC anthology series were described
by their fans.
   ``Love Boat'' followed a cruise ship and its crew members, with
second-tier guest stars occupying three story lines about couples
facing various impediments to the course of true love. This show
made Barbi Benton a star.
   It is impossible to convey the unreality of ``Love Boat''
situations and characters, because they obeyed conventions of
thought, behavior and dress that existed only on television -
sometimes only on ``The Love Boat.''
   ``Fantasy Island'' flouted those conventions. Ricardo Montalban
played the mysterious host of a resort island where, by magic, his
guests lived out their fantasies. It featured comic oddity Herve
Villechaize, whose role consisted mainly of croaking, ``Da plane,
boss! Da plane!''
   ``Love Boat'' picked up fans in syndication after Lauren Tewes
(``Hi, I'm Julie, your cruise director!'') was fired because of a
raging, debilitating cocaine addiction that remains obvious to even
the most casual viewer.
   It also produced a U.S. congressman, Harvard-educated Fred
(``Gopher'') Grandy, R-Iowa.
   
   7. ``HOLLYWOOD SQUARES'' - A panel of celebrities waiting in the
interstices of a tic-tac-toe grid! Three in a row and you win!
   Celebrity quips! Celebrity innuendos! Coached panelists!
   Dreadful! Still, it was one of the few settings where Liberace
seemed to be comfortable, relaxed and spontaneous.
   
   6. ``THE DUKES OF HAZZARD'' - CBS' hugely successful kid program
about two vaguely Appalachian, vaguely Southern good ol' boys (Tom
Wopat and John Schneider) and their beloved car, the General Lee
(440 Dodge Charger, 1969).
   The plot lines weren't tough to diagram: Conflict. Crisis. Car
chase. End of car chase. End of conflict.
   The slapstick was bad, and the Duke boys' dialogue even worse.
   Wopat and Schneider complained about the poor quality of the
scripts. Nobody cared. The actors claimed they were getting ripped
off on merchandising and royalties. Warner Bros. denied it.
   Wopat and Schneider struck, sued; Warner Bros. countersued and
hired replacement Dukes. The show's ratings plummeted, a settlement
was reached and Wopat and Schneider returned to the show.
   The stars' careers have not flourished; Warner Bros. remains in
the entertainment business to this day.
   This show also produced a U.S. congressman - Ben Jones, D-Ga.,
who played Cooter. Might abysmal television be a breeding ground
for federal office? Could a grade-B movie star be elected
president? Naaahhh.
   
   5. ``MANIMAL'' - This show about a crimefighter who could change
into animals lasted three months on NBC in 1983. (Sample dialogue:
``He's out catting around.'')
   Arf!
   
   4. ``LOVE CONNECTION'' - Since 1983, the syndicated ``Love
Connection'' with host Chuck Woolery has been introducing couples
by videotape.
   This is the spiritual heir to ``The Dating Game,'' where a
bachelor or ``bachelorette'' would ask vaguely suggestive questions
to a trio of hidden singles. (``Bachelor No. 1, if you were a main
dish, what would you be?'')
   ``Love Connection'' singles audit three videos, select a
partner, go out on a date, and agree not to discuss the date until
they reappear on national television to discuss it. Uh-huh.
   If the studio audience picked a different partner, the show
offered to pay for a second date with the audience's choice and
return again. ``To date,'' the ``Love Connection'' reported this
year, ``the show has spawned 17 marriages and seven babies.''
   
   3. ``THAT'S INCREDIBLE!'' - ABC's answer to NBC's 1979 genuinely
innovative ``Real People,'' which featured various eccentrics,
human interest stories and bits of Americana.
   ``That's Incredible!'' staged stunts that were incredible,
including a daredevil who was severely burned when he ran through a
tunnel of fire. Another featured guest, an inventor, later was
indicted on federal fraud charges.
   An expose by TV Guide in 1982 revealed several of the show's
stunts were faked, but it didn't leave the air until 1984.
   That's incredible.
   
   2. ``SUPERTRAIN'' - One of the costliest flops in network
history, NBC's 1979 ``Supertrain'' was a huge, nuclear-powered
luxury train, a ``Love Boat'' on rails that had a steam room, pool,
gym, disco and no discernible ideas.
   It was laughed off the air after a month, brought back a month
later, and finally vanished into Nielsen Gulch.
   
   1. ``TURN-ON'' - Developed in 1969 by ``Laugh-In'' and ``Real
People'' creator George Schlatter, ``Turn-On'' was very much in the
manner of ``Laugh-In.'' By all accounts, it was far too suggestive
for its era, which puts it on the milder side of ``Married ... with
Children.''
   After one broadcast of ``Turn-On,'' 75 affiliates that had tuned
in dropped out. ABC canceled it by the end of the week.
   
   Is there a lesson for the '90s in all this bad television? Yes.
We are what we have beheld.
   You may scream now.

<HEAD>Joe Pantoliano Improves His Reading After Taking up Acting</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joe Pantoliano of NBC's ``The Fanelli Boys''
says his career nearly ended before it started, when he almost
missed out on a role in his high school senior play because of his
third-grade reading level.
   The chance to act, and two dedicated teachers, gave him the
motivation to improve his reading skills.
   ``When I was cast in `Up The Down Staircase,' it was a major
victory,'' said Pantoliano, who launched a busy career in movies
with that high school play in New Jersey. ``I didn't read well. I
was really a bad student.
   ``When I auditioned for the play, I had a third-grade reading
equivalency. I'd memorized the text and made it look like I was
reading,'' he said.
   ``Acting was something I'd always wanted to do but had been
afraid of because of the ridicule I'd get from my family and
friends - which was soon forthcoming.''
   Pantoliano's new comedy series, ``The Fanelli Boys,'' is about a
boisterous Italian family of four grown brothers, whose misfortunes
send them back to live with their strong-willed mother and to run
the struggling family-owned funeral home.
   Pantoliano plays Dominic, a small-time hustler.
   ``With `The Fanelli Boys,' they sent me a script, I read it,
talked to them, and they offered me the job,'' he said. ``If it was
always that easy, I'd like this business.
   ``Dominic is an entrepreneur, a jack of all trades, a master of
none. His role models are Cary Grant and John Gotti. He's the kind
of man who would bend the law, but never break it. As we go along,
I'm less and less involved in the extracurricular activities.''
   Others in the cast are Ann Guilbert as the mother, and
Christopher Meloni, Ned Eisenberg and Andy Hirsch as the other
brothers. Richard Libertini plays the boys' uncle, a burned-out
Catholic priest suffering a mid-life crisis.
   The setting of the show, which is on Wednesdays opposite ABC's
``Doogie Howser, M.D.'' and CBS' ``Jake and the Fat Man,'' echoes
part of Pantoliano's upbringing.
   He grew up in Hoboken, N.J., where his father worked for 15
years for a funeral home.
   ``He drove a hearse, picked up bodies and acted as a
pallbearer,'' Pantoliano said.
   A family with problem characters is nothing new for Pantoliano,
who said his stepfather was a small-time gangster who served time
in prison.
   ``His father had been a wiseguy, and he aspired to be like
him,'' Pantoliano said at his home in the Venice area of Los
Angeles. ``He hijacked the Hoboken Ferry once. He was after three
liquor trucks on the ferry, but he couldn't get one of the trucks
started. So he took the ferry all the way to Poughkeepsie. That
made it interstate kidnapping.
   ``A year later, one of the gang members was busted. He didn't
finger my stepfather, but he (the stepfather) still got seven years
in prison. When he finally got out of prison, he was 50 and went
straight. He warned me never to become a gangster.''
   When Pantoliano left high school, he went across the Hudson
River and entered acting school in New York City. He landed his
first acting job at the age of 19.
   ``I got $10 a week, and it took $9 a week for food,'' he said.
``I lived over the theater in Compton, R.I. I got little bit parts
in movies in New York. I finally moved to Los Angeles because I
couldn't get arrested in New York.''
   In Los Angeles, he was cast in a series called ``McNamara's
Band.'' It folded after three episodes and he was out of work for
eight months. Next came ``Free Country,'' which ran six episodes.
   Then he landed the part of Angelo Maggio in the 1979 miniseries
``From Here To Eternity,'' the role that won an Oscar for Frank
Sinatra in 1953.
   NBC turned ``From Here to Eternity'' into a regular series and
offered to revive the role of Maggio - who died in the original -
but Pantoliano turned it down.
   ``They offered me a fortune, but I'd done the role,'' he said.
``I spent the next 12 months working as a waiter in an Italian
restaurant. Once I waited on Fred Silverman, the man at NBC I'd
said `no' to. I was broke, but even now I don't live
extravagantly.''
   Pantoliano's first role after that was in the theatrical movie
``The Idolmaker'' - and the first scene was filmed in the same
restaurant where he had waited tables.
   He has worked steadily since, appearing in such movies as
``Risky Business,'' ``Goonies,'' ``Running Scared,'' ``La Bamba,''
``Midnight Run,'' ``Empire of the Sun'' and ``The Mean Season.''
   He's also in the upcoming ``Zandalee,'' with Nicholas Cage and
Judge Reinhold, in which he plays a transvestite.

<TEXT>
   The chairman of Archer Daniels Midland Co. and
other company executives helped an FBI agent infiltrate the futures
market at the Chicago Board of Trade, the agent testified.
   Agent Richard Ostrom testified Tuesday in federal court that ADM
chairman Dwayne Andreas, President James Randall, Chicago
operations chief Thomas Frankel and several other officers of the
Decatur-based agricultural giant knew he was an undercover
investigator.
   The company trained Ostrom and gave him his first job among
soybean traders now on trial on fraud and racketeering charges,
Ostrom testified under cross-examination.
   In a hearing after jurors were dismissed Tuesday, defense
attorney George Collins told U.S. District Judge George M. Marovich
that ADM had been especially antagonistic toward the Board of Trade
since being fined $25,000 in a dispute over alleged soybean price
manipulation.
   Collins suggested that the opinions of ADM executives may have
shaped Ostrom's investigation.

<HEAD>Caterpillar Strikes Huge Deal with Romania</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL VOGRIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Caterpillar Inc. is cashing in on the end of
U.S. trade sanctions against Soviet bloc countries by selling 212
earth-moving machines to the Romanian government for use in coal
mining.
   An analyst said Tuesday the deal could be worth $50 million for
Caterpillar and may help the company reclaim Eastern Bloc markets
lost to the Japanese during the Reagan administration embargo.
   ``It's a very significant deal for Caterpillar,'' said Frank
Manfredi of Manfredi and Associates, a Buffalo Grove, Ill.-based
analyst of the heavy machinery industry.
   Under a barter agreement announced Monday, Romania will receive
200 articulated dump trucks, 10 track-type tractors, a motor grader
and a wheel-loader.
   The equipment will be delivered during the next nine months,
said Jeff Hawkinson, spokesman for Caterpillar, the world's largest
manufacturer of earth-moving equipment.
   ``This will boost Caterpillar's market share considerably,''
Manfredi said. ``It's a pretty big deal when you consider the world
market for articulated trucks is about 3,000 units annually and
they just sold 200, or about 7 percent of the world market in one
deal. That's not bad.''
   Caterpillar released few details about the deal. But Manfredi
estimated its value at ``approximately $50 million'' based on a
price range of $100,000 to $170,000 for articulated dump trucks,
commonly used on projects with rough terrain and bad conditions.
   The huge off-road vehicles are built in two sections and bend in
the middle for turning rather than using conventional steering in
which the wheels turn from side-to-side.
   ``Normally, these trucks are not used in mining operations,''
Manfredi said. ``That must mean Romania's roads must be in pretty
bad shape around their mining operations.''
   Manfredi speculated the 10 tractors are likely large bulldozers
worth upwards of $500,000 apiece. And the company usually sends a
supply of spare parts in package deals, which would push the value
even higher.
   The cash-poor country will pay for the equipment with
unspecified Romanian goods and services.
   Thaddeus Kopinski, director of the office of Central and Eastern
Europe for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, said Romania
may be paying Caterpillar with fork-lift trucks.
   ``Romania's chief export item is fork-lift trucks,'' Kopinski
said. ``It's part of their material-handling sector and it fits
into Caterpillar's profile.''
   Manfredi said the barter agreement gives Caterpillar an
advantage over competitors who are unable to accept such conditions
for sales.
   ``Prior to the Reagan trade embargo, Caterpillar was the
supplier of choice to the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries
for years,'' Manfredi said.
   Caterpillar Chairman Donald Fites told a group of visiting
Soviet journalists last month that Caterpillar held 85 percent of
the world market of imported mining equipment in the Soviet Union
in 1981.
   Those customers were forfeited to Caterpillar's chief
competitor, Komatsu, and other Japanese manufacturers during the
embargo.
   Caterpillar has reclaimed about 50 percent of the lost business,
Fites said.
   Manfrei said the numbers are the same for Eastern Bloc nations
such as Romania.
   Hawkinson said the sale to Romania is the first in more than 10
years for Caterpillar. And he called it one of the company's
biggest deals in Eastern Europe in a number of years.
   Hawkinson said Caterpillar sees Eastern Europe as a market with
great potential because of the region's deteriorated
infrastructure.

<HEAD>Yeltsin Challenges Gorbachev's New Economic Plan</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Yeltsin comments. No pickup. Also
moving on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plan for
switching to a free-market economy backs away from a 500-day
timetable, and Boris N. Yeltsin, leader of the Russian republic,
said it was doomed to fail within six months.
   Gorbachev's 66-page blueprint, delivered to members of the
national legislature Tuesday, is at least the fourth in a confusing
and complicated series of plans for salvaging the failing economy.
   ``Another endeavor is thus being made to perpetuate the system
hated by the people,'' Yeltsin said Tuesday. ``The new program is a
catastrophe which will break out within the first few months.''
   ``If the ... Parliament approves today's uncompromising program,
it will take less than six months to realize that the chosen road
is another blunder.'' A text of Yeltsin's remarks to the Russian
Federation's legislature was published today in Sovietskaya
Rossiya, the Russian Communist newspaper.
   Gorbachev's plan would give the 15 Soviet republics sweeping new
powers to run the nation's economy, free many prices from
government regulation and allow private ownership of businesses. It
sets no timetable for the transition, but notes other nations have
accomplished similar goals in 1{ to two years.
   Gorbachev is to present his plan to the Supreme Soviet national
legislature on Friday, and the 542 members could vote on it as
early as Saturday. Parliamentary committees began studying the
proposals today.
   Yeltsin, president of the Russian republic, and the federation's
other leaders have endorsed a radical plan for scrapping Communist
central planning for a market-based economy in 500 days.
   Yeltsin said the Russian republic could go ahead with that
program on Nov. 1, setting up its own currency, customs service and
army.
   He acknowledged this would be difficult and costly, even for the
biggest and wealthiest of the 15 Soviet republics, but said: ``If
we show indecision in such a situation, we will lose the voters'
trust and respect.''
   ``If we procrastinate and put off (the reform) further, there
will be nothing to reform because the economy will simply fall to
pieces,'' he said.
   Yeltsin said Gorbachev's program, if adopted, would increase the
national budget deficit to about $528 billion.
   ``The consumer market inevitably will be swamped by a shower of
paper (money) and prices may grow dozens of times,'' he said.
   The plan Yeltsin has endorsed is named after its chief
architect, economist Stanislav Shatalin. It differs from
Gorbachev's plan in several key respects.
   The Shatalin plan suggests selling factories to private owners,
breaking up collective farms and returning land to peasants, but
the Gorbachev plan drops a clear commitment to private ownership of
land. It says only that republic authorities will decide conditions
for giving land to people for agriculture.
   The Shatalin plan would also gradually end all state control on
prices. Under the Gorbachev plan, the government would still set
prices in 1992 on bread, meat, dairy products and a few other
staples.
   Yeltsin said the Gorbachev plan was an attempt ``to preserve the
administrative-bureaucratic system.''
   The proposal caps an intensive three-week effort by Gorbachev
and top economists to resolve fundamental differences over how to
change a system that fails to provide adequate food, shelter and
services for the country's 285 million people.
   Differences among competing economic plans have touched on the
very underpinnings of Soviet communism: socialist property,
collective labor and state ownership of all land.
   ``People's lives are becoming more difficult, their interest in
labor is falling, their faith in the future is crumbling,'' the
Gorbachev plan says.
   It says the long lines in which Soviet shoppers must stand daily
are a ``shame,'' and acknowledges rising food prices, overcrowded
apartments and empty store shelves.
   But it hesitates to move ahead too quickly with reform, stating:
``The experience of applying stabilization programs in other
countries ... shows that such a period can take about 1{ to two
years.''
   Gorbachev's compromise package, however, borrows heavily from
the Shatalin plan in giving republics more economic power.
   Under Gorbachev's plan, republics would gain control of most of
the resources on their territory. After delegating much economic
power to republics, businesses and individuals, the central
government would concentrate on defense, energy, highways,
railroads, space exploration and communications.
   Gorbachev originally supported the Shatalin plan which was to
have gone into effect Oct. 1, ``but the sinking union (national)
government put pressure on the president, and he again changed his
mind,'' Yeltsin said.

<HEAD>OPEC Leader Criticizes Oil Consumers</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subroto without first name is CQ.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top official of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries strongly criticized oil consuming
countries on Wednesday for failing to release oil reserves to help
curb rising oil prices.
   OPEC Secretary General Subroto said consumer countries have been
reminded that it might be too late to keep oil prices within
reasonable bounds if they waited until the fourth quarter of the
year to release their strategic stocks.
   ``Unfortunately, these appeals proved fruitless. This is a great
pity, and a clear indication that ... The concept of real
cooperation between producers and consumers for oil market
stability still seems to fall on the deaf ears of the majority,''
Subroto said.
   He said that OPEC has already acted to reduce the danger of an
oil shortage by pumping out as much oil as it can.
   ``The ball is now in the consumers' court: it is now up to them
to bolster the market's defense against an impending energy
shortage by drawing down on their stocks,'' he told an
international energy conference in Jakarta.
   Paul Vlaanderen, representative of the International Energy
Agency, told the conference earlier that its analysis showed that
world crude oil markets are still adequately supplied and no
product shortfalls have been experienced by its members.
   Vlaanderen said the agency acknowledged that the oil markets are
nervous in the wake of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, but the
situation still is manageable.
   He said prices are fluctuating based upon fears of war or hopes
for peace in the Persian Gulf and the current strains on the oil
system are unlikely to be remedied by a simple drawdown of IEA
strategic stocks.
   ``It is a political phenomenon and not a supply-demand
fundamental which drives the market. Physical shortages do not
explain present price fluctuations,'' he said.
   Subroto told the conference that OPEC's total sustainable
production capacity would increase from the current 28 million
barrels to 34 million barrels a day in 1995.
   He said non-OPEC production would remain unchanged or fall
slightly by the end of century and oil supply from the Communist
countries would decline, largely because of lower Soviet production
and higher consumption in China.
   Demand for OPEC oil increased from 15.45 million barrels a day
in 1985 to 21.91 million barrels in 1989. This year, the figure is
expected to reach 23 million barrels.
   Helga Steeg, executive director of the International Energy
Agency, said member countries of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development would grow more dependent on imports
due not only to rising oil demand but also to a decline in their
oil production.
   Mrs. Steeg said in a prepared statement that OECD's dependence
on imports could rise from 53 percent in 1988 to 70 percent by
2005.
   The OECD members include the United States, Germany, Japan and
other industrial nations.

   The company that brought the all-purpose
Swiss Army pocketknife to America is now offering products that do
more than open wine bottles, strip wire or gut fish.
   Forschner Group Inc., the U.S. distributor of the multiblade red
knives with silver crosses, has expanded into the sunglass and
watch business with its new subsidiary, Swiss Army Brands Ltd.
   The company is banking on consumers' familiarity with the Swiss
Army name to get these products off the ground.
   ``There is a high-quality imagery associated with the knife,''
said Forschner President James Kennedy. ``It has always been known
as a useful, utilitarian product and we were able to transfer that
to the watch's image.''
   Sales of the Swiss Army Brand watch totaled around $4 million
since its debut last fall, double the projections, said Kennedy.
   The simple watch with a large face, big numbers and black strap
was designed in the United States and manufactured in Switzerland.
It sells for $95 retail.
   The Swiss Army Brand aviator-style sunglasses were introduced in
April and sell for around $115 retail. But sales have been
disappointing thus far, totaling just $385,000 in the first nine
months of this year. Kennedy said the glasses came out too late to
be included in many retailers' summer catalogs.
   The new products are targeted at upscale, outdoorsy types who
frequent camping and hunting stores. The company does minimal
advertising and its products are sold by exclusive retailers such
as Hoffritz for Cutlery, Eddie Bauer and Hammacher Schlemmer.
   The Swiss-based Victorinox Cutlery Co., founded in 1884 by Karl
Elsener, developed the original Swiss Army knife in 1891. Its
patent on the pocketknife expired in 1908, and since then, many
imitations have surfaced.
   About half the soldiers in the Swiss Army carry Victorinox
knives. The rest are manufactured by their rival, Wenger, which
also sells Swiss Army knives in the United States through retailers
like K Mart and L. L. Bean.
   Victorinox makes 295 different models of the knife, but
Forschner sells only about 50 in the United States.
   The ``Scientist'' model features a magnifying glass, while the
``Tinker'' contains two can openers and a Phillips screwdriver. A
saw, pliers, scissors and a file are part of the ``Craftsman.''
   Forschner became a distributor for the pocketknives shortly
after World War II. The company started out 135 years ago in New
Britain selling only butcher scales. In the 1930s, it added
Victorinox butcher knives to its line.
   The butcher knives, sold almost exclusively to slaughterhouses
and restaurants, accounted for 27 percent of Forschner's business
last year. Another 23 percent came from Swiss Army knives printed
with corporate logos. The other half came from the pocketknives.
   When Kennedy came to work at the company in 1975, it decided to
stop selling butcher scales and to halt sales of the pocketknives
to its 40 wholesaers. Forschner began selling the pocketknives
directly to specialty retail stores.
   Imitation knives have plagued Forschner for years, but when
knockoffs of the watches started showing up in stores for $20-$25,
the company took immediate action against some Asian manufacturers
for violating trade laws.
   Since the knockoffs were not manufactured in Switzerland, the
companies making them were not allowed to call them Swiss-style or
Swiss-like and were prohibited from using the trademark Swiss
Cross.
   Such restrictions also have limited Forschner's growth.
   ``We have to have all our products made in Switzerland, where
the factories are small, inefficient and expensive,'' Kennedy said.
He added that the strength of the Swiss franc has added to his
purchase price.
   Nonetheless, in the past 16 years, Forschner's profits have
grown 4,000 percent. Last year, Forschner sold $33 million worth of
knives, up from less than $1 million in 1974.

   After failing to offer hard evidence that
Michael Milken masterminded a 1986 stock manipulation, prosecutors
will move to a second transaction they say paints the junk bond
king as a rampant criminal.
   Milken, 44, has pleaded guilty to six felony counts related to
illegal trading, but the government wants to demonstrate he
deserves a long prison term for allegedly engaging in broader
lawbreaking during his career.
   Testimony concluded Tuesday without a smoking gun that Milken
ordered Wickes Cos. stock manipulated upward in April 1986 via
large purchases by former speculator Ivan Boesky.
   Legal experts said the government's case so far was surprisingly
weak even though there is a lower burden of proof in the hearing
than a trial. Wickes was prosecutors' first choice for proving the
extra wrongdoing by Milken.
   ``What really puzzles me is why the government didn't anticipate
this was going to be a letdown and choose some other transactions
and witnesses,'' said Alan Bromberg, a securities law professor at
Southern Methodist University.
   ``It strikes me the government may be caught up in the web of
its own conspiracy theory - that everything that happened was part
of this grand conspiracy between Milken and Boesky,'' he said.
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood appeared skeptical of aspects of
the government's case. ``Fairly ambiguous'' is how she described
orders allegedly made by Milken to manipulate Wickes as described
by a former Drexel trader.
   Wood ordered the pre-sentencing hearing to gain greater insight
into Milken's character before she decides his punishment. He has
agreed to pay $600 million in penalties and faces up to 28 years in
prison.
   The proceeding marks the first test of the government's evidence
against Milken after a four-year pursuit of the former Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. financier that included a 98-count
racketeering and fraud indictment.
   At the end of testimony Monday, Milken lawyer Arthur Liman
suggested calling off the rest of the hearing because it only was
polarizing the case and not helping Wood fashion a sentence.
   Courtroom observers said Liman was satisfied with the defense on
Wickes and may have been seeking an end before the second and third
alleged illegal transactions against Milken are aired.
   But Judge Wood said: ``So far the hearings have been very
helpful to the court. They are filling a certain type of void.
Although I am questioning the government closely, at this point I
haven't reached any conclusions.''
   The government's case in Wickes hinged on the testimony of a
former Drexel trader who claimed Milken was involved in
manipulating Wickes. But the trader and two other government
witnesses offered no direct connection between Milken with Boesky.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Carroll asserted that given the
nature of Milken's other admitted schemes with Boesky he was linked
to the Wickes manipulation. Wood dismissed that argument.
   The government's case now shifts to two other transactions from
its 132-page pre-sentencing memorandum that portrays Milken as a
greedy cheater. The defense claims his crimes involved isolated
instances of going too far to help clients and they have requested
no prison time.
   The hearing is to resume Thursday with testimony on allegations
of misappropriations and bribery in securities of Storer
Communications Inc. in 1985. The third transaction alleges insider
trading in securities of Caesar's World Inc. in 1983.
   On Tuesday, the government implied but offered no proof that the
prospect of multimillion-dollar fees may have motivated Milken and
Drexel to break the law to help Wickes retire an expensive
preferred security.
   Under questioning by Carroll, former Drexel corporate finance
executive Joseph Harch said there ``were many positives'' to
retiring the costly preferred stock issue.
   But Harch, testifying for the defense, said Wickes Chairman
Sanford Sigoloff never asked Drexel to buy Wickes stock to push up
its price and Milken never told him any such activity would occur.
Harch said Drexel did not undertake any financing solely to
preserve Wickes as a client.
   Former Drexel trader Peter Gardiner testified Monday that Milken
asked traders to find buyers for Wickes and said to him, ``Peter,
Wickes, 6&lsqb;.'' Gardiner said he interpreted that as an order to
close the stock at that level.
   Liman conceded Wickes was manipulated but said Milken played no
role.

   Texas Instruments Inc. has laid off 450 defense
employees as part of the company's yearlong plan to reduce costs.
   Texas Instruments officials announced in June they would fire
1,000 of the 22,000 workers at the Defense Systems &amp; Electronics
Group over the next 12 months.
   Company spokeswoman Terri West said Tuesday's layoffs bring the
total to about 950 employees fired so far. ``They (layoffs) are in
response to constraints on national defense spending,'' Ms. West
said.
   Texas Instruments' defense division generates about $2 billion
of the company's $6.5 billion annual revenue.
   Of the 450 workers notified Tuesday, 380 worked in Texas with
165 employed in Dallas. Other fired TI workers were employed mainly
in either California or Colorado, Ms. West said.
   Those affected by the announcement will receive severance pay
and insurance benefits for 60 days. All laid off workers will also
receive help from the company's job placement office, Ms. West
said.
   Dallas-based Texas Instruments, the second largest U.S.
semiconductor manufacturer, employs about 73,000 workers worldwide.

   A Hong Kong businessman announced Wednesday he
has received a strong response from bank lenders to a request for
an $800 million loan to finance the construction of a superhighway
in southern China.
   The loan would be one of the biggest since the June 4, 1989,
military attack on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing, which
resulted in a drastic decline in foreign lending for China-based
business plans.
   Gordon Wu, managing director of Hopewell Holdings Ltd., said
documents have been given to 20 local and foreign banks to solicit
funds and initial responses had been ``overwhelming.''
   ``We have no problem at all in getting the money. Now we have to
persuade some banks to give us less,'' he said.
   Wu declined to identify the participating banks, but said half
are Japanese. Nor would he disclose the pricing terms although it
was believed that the loan's interest rate will be substantially
above the London Interbank Offered Rate, the rate banks in London
charge each other for dollar-denominated loans.
   Wu said the breakdown of the banks would be announced later this
month.
   The 12-year syndicated loan is regarded as one of the barometers
of foreign banks' confidence in China because of its size and long
term commitment.
   Since June of last year, most major foreign banks have suspended
medium to long term loans to China due to the uncertain political
outlook in the mainland.
   Loans that have been given have been generally done in
consortium, like Hopewell's loan, because bankers remain wary.
   Earlier this year, the the Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Co.
arranged a $126 million loan.
   The 143-mile highway, linking the southern Chinese city of
Canton and its neighboring boom towns of Zhuhai and Shenzhen, would
take four years to complete and the first section between Canton
and Shenzhen would be completed within a year, Wu said.
   With a total investment of $1.2 billion, he said the highway
would help to ease already heavy traffic among the three cities,
considered to be the richest in China.
   Wu said he has encountered no difficulty so far in the project
apart from securing land for construction work.
   China's Bank of China and this British colony's Hongkong and
Shanghai Corp. are responsible for the underwriting arrangements,
and Wu said Japanese banks had so far indicated their readiness to
provide more than half of the $800 million.

   Union Pacific Corp. on Wednesday reported
a 17.5 percent increase in its third-quarter profit, spurred by
record carloadings on its railroad subsidiary.
   Net income was $161 million, or $1.61 per share, for the three
months ended Sept. 30, up from $137 million, or $1.35 per share, a
year earlier.
   Revenue rose 17.1 percent to $1.85 billion from $1.58 billion
during the third quarter of 1989.
   Union Pacific Railroad's earnings rose 4 percent to a record
$148 million, despite a $17 million increase in fuel prices.
   Overall freight traffic gained 7 percent to 1.08 million
carloads, the highest for any quarter in the company's history. The
railroad had 1.01 carloads during last year's third quarter.
   Coal loadings were up 10 percent; autos, 13 percent; food
products, 14 percent; and containers and trailers, 8 percent.
Forest products were down 3 percent, the only slippage among major
commodities.
   Higher crude prices related to the Persian Gulf crisis helped
boost earnings 11 percent for Union Pacific Resources, a natural
resources subsidiary.
   For the year's first nine months, Union Pacific said profits
totaled $442 million, or $4.41 a share, up 3.3 percent from $428
million, or $3.98 a share, in 1989.
   Revenue for the nine months rose 12.8 percent to $5.36 billion
from $4.75 billion.

<TEXT>
   Ronald Li, former chairman of the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange, was convicted Wednesday in the High Court on
corruption charges.
   A seven-member jury deliberated for more than 10 hours before
convicting Li of accepting preferential offerings of shares in
Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. and Novel Enterprises Ltd. in 1986 and
1987 in exchange for helping to obtain listings on the market for
the companies' shares.
   Li, 61, had pleaded innocent to the charges. The jury convicted
Li by a margin of 5-2, sufficient in Hong Kong to find a defendant
guilty.
   He faces a maximum penalty of seven years in prison and $64,000
in fines on each of two counts.
   Li was a powerful figure in this British colony's stockbroking
community for two decades.
   In the trial, Michael Kalisher, the lead prosecutor, described
Li as the patriarch of an exclusive society funded by friendly
merchant bankers.
   ``It was a very cozy little club,'' he said in court.
   He alleged Li made more than $100,000 in profits by selling the
shares he was awarded.
   In defense, Li compared himself to the owner of a restaurant who
knows what the meals are but not how they are prepared.
   Li was instrumental in merging the colony's four exchanges into
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange four years ago, turning the stock
market of this British colony into one of the most dynamic in the
world.
   His decision to close the exchange for four days during the
world stock market crash in October of 1987 led to calls for his
resignation.
   He stepped down as chairman of the exchange one month before he
was arrested in January 1988.
   Between Li's arrest and his appearance in court, prosecutors
dropped 13 charges lodged against him under the colony's Bribery
Prevention Ordinance because of lack of evidence.
   Li faces other charges along with seven former members of the
exchange scheduled to be tried in February.

   The White House today urged the House to
overcome its objections to Senate-passed legislation providing
child care assistance to low income families, and to endorse the
Senate version.
   The latest Senate version, unveiled by Democratic and Republican
leaders Tuesday, is a five-year, $15 billion package. Most of the
money would go for an expansion of earned income tax credits for
low-income working families with children.
   ``This is a great step forward for parents, child care and
education. We urge the House to pass it in its current form,'' said
President Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater today.
   A second element is a new program of grants to the states, which
would pass the money along to child-care centers or directly to
families to offset part of their child care costs. Church-run
centers would be eligible for the federal aid.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., described the package as a compromise that
has President Bush's support, and said it would break a long
deadlock over the child care bill.
   But House members were excluded from negotiations with the White
House over the package, and the latest version fell short in scope
and spending from a version passed earlier this year by the House.
   At least one key House sponsor said he would not go along with
the Senate's deal.
   ``There are enormous differences,'' said Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y.
   Dole, in response, said the House would be to blame if child
care fails to pass. ``Now it's time for the House to join the
Senate and the White House so this priority legislation doesn't die
before Congress adjourns,'' he said.
   Federal child care assistance was backed by both presidential
candidates in 1988, but the issue has been stuck in conference
committees since clearing the House and Senate. With Congress
nearing adjournment and consumed by deficit-reduction battles, the
outlook for a child-care bill had appeared to be worsening.
   Part of the new agreement is a strategy to bypas the deadlocked
House and Senate conferees, who have been unable to resolve
differences.
   Mitchell said the bill would be included in the Senate's budget
deficit-reduction bill - adding child care to the tax-increase and
spending-cut package that Congress is trying to pass before a
midnight Friday deadline.
   Downey, however, said the House would resist that move.
   Under the new agreement, grants to the states for aid to
families with child-care costs would amount to $2.5 billion over
three years, compared with $6 billion over five years in earlier
versions. Downey said the Senate's plan was inadequate and that
twice as much was needed.
   The Senate bill also includes licensing, health and safety
requirements for day-care centers - although they are weaker than
those the House was seeking.
   The measure authorizes the grants to the states as a separate
program requiring yearly appropriations. House backers - fearing
child care would suffer in the yearly competition for money - had
rejected that approach in favor of making it an entitlement program
under the Social Security Act so it would be automatically included
in the budget annually.
   Also excluded from the Senate-White House version is a section
in the House bill providing money to help local governments
establish or expand child-care programs based in the public
schools.
   The new version would earmark a quarter of the grants to be used
for early childhood education and before- and after-school child
care services.
   The agreement has the support of the Children's Defense Fund, an
advocacy group that has pushed for child care and which has battled
the House leadership over the method.
   ``This is a start, a beginning of a federal child-care program
that provides a strong base on which to build,'' said Helen Blank,
lobbyist for the fund.

   Helmeted and harnessed, Du Pont Co.
workers grunt, groan and sweat as they scale a 40-foot wall, climb
a skinny 30-foot pole and zip down a 300-foot wire.
   They cheer each other on with shouts of ``You can do it!''
``We're behind ya!'' ``How do you feel?''
   With a break for a brown-bag lunch, they've finished the first
half of the day-long ``Ropes Course'' - the introduction to Du Pont
Fibers Department's ``Playing to Win'' seminars and empowered
learning teams.
   The idea is to keep fibers competitive and increase productivity
of employees who can work better with supervisors and each other,
said Clifford E. Nix, fibers development director.
   The company is spending at least $23 million on the effort. It
paid $1.3 million for the 45-acre campsite on the Elk River in
northeastern Maryland. It leases resorts for fibers employees to
take the same training at two sites in North Carolina, and one in
Virginia and Tennessee. All of the sites are near Du Pont fibers
plants.
   The seminars - four days for managers and two days for employees
with their managers - are similar to the wilderness training
courses that became popular among corporate executives in the
1980s.
   But Du Pont's program, which began about four months ago, is
unique because it is in-house and is required for all 20,000
employees in the fibers department, which makes polyester, nylon,
spandex and other materials.
   The company has contracted with Pecos River Learning Centers, of
Santa Fe, N.M., to provide the training.
   ``What we want to create is (a work) environment where people's
values can truly be expressed with the team, and having an
environment where those values can be brought to the surface and
having the freedom to express that,'' Nix said.
   That means changing management style.
   ``The key to the success of this whole effort is the willingness
of the leadership to embrace change themselves. There's room for
change, but the leadership has to let go and shift our behavior and
our roles as leaders in the organization,'' Nix said.
   ``There have been a lot of companies experimenting with what we
call employee involvement programs . . . It's based upon an
established theory that if employees are involved in the
decision-making process, morale and productivity will go up,'' said
Douglas M. McCabe, a labor relations expert and professor at
Georgetown University in Washington.
   James H. Wilbur, a securities analyst with Smith Barney, Harris
Upham &amp; Co., said the timing is right because fibers earnings are
likely to fall short of last year's. ``So if you can get the people
to work together and be productive, it couldn't come at a better
time than when things are tight.''
   He said earnings in the fibers department - which represent
nearly a quarter of Du Pont's total profits - have been hurt by a
rise in foreign competition and raw materials costs. The division's
first quarter profit fell to $168 million from $173 million last
year. Second quarter earnings dropped to $157 million from $182
million.
   Miles Overholt, a management consultant and family therapist,
said the program can be successful if Du Pont sustains enthusiasm
among its employees.
   ``Any kind of program that's out on the market now, such as
Pecos River, are great as a kick-off because the message is clear.
It's direct, it's concise. The hard part is continuing it,'' said
Overholt, president of Applied Organizational Development Inc., of
Palmyra, N.J.
   McCabe, of Georgetown University, said the new approach can be
sustained only if ``top management is totally dedicated to the
proposition of employee involvement.''
   ``Trust has to be a very strong value of the organization.
Trusting each other in that work environment. Industry as a whole
has got to embrace that value,'' Nix said.
   When the training began, employees were skeptical and it was
difficult to get them to attend. Now, the courses are booked
through June 1991.
   More than 3,000 employees have been trained at the sites since
the first one opened in June in Virginia at Natural Bridge.
   ``Each week that goes by, my conviction grows. It's much
different today than the way I felt in May or June. You wondered if
people were going to get on the bus'' to go to the sites, Nix said.
   ``People who haven't gone through it generally don't know what
to think of it. Those who have gone through it, there has been a
good response,'' but there still appears to be a wait-and-see
attitude, said Nancy Tidona, Du Pont spokeswoman.
   Nix said the teams will continue training with 10 four-hour
seminars in the workplace spread over 18 months after visiting the
wilderness site.
   When the entire department has completed all of the training, he
said, he expects fibers to be in ``a more competitive position for
the future. I expect more unity and more productivity.''
   But the program hasn't been without its problems. George W.
Martin, a 58-yera-old plant supervisor, died of a heart attack in
September after completing one of Ropes Course activities.
   Nix said the only other accident has been a sprained ankle.
Employees with medical problems are excused from the exercises, he
said.
   After each activity, the teams are debriefed to discuss how the
activity relates to their work.
   The concept behind three people hooked together to scale a
40-foot wall is to make a group decision on whether to make it to
the top. There should be no hard feelings if a member does not want
to go on, Tidona said.
   ``You can only go as far as your weakest team members,'' she
said.
   ``I expect when it's all over I'll probably be a little more
open with my peers and be more supportive of others,'' employee
Richard Block said, on the first day of a recent four-day seminar.

   The Coca-Cola Co. reported Wednesday its
third-quarter earnings rose 9.1 percent as it chalked up sales
gains around the world
   Coca-Cola said it earned $394.2 million, or 58 cents per share,
up from $361.3 million, or 51 cents per share, in the same period a
year earlier.
   Revenue totaled $2.8 billion, up from $2.2 billion.
   The company reported its soft drink sales rose in the United
States and overseas.
   Coca-Cola Foods, which includes Minute Maid juice brands,
reported a rebound in sales in the third quarter following a drop
during the first half of 1990. Sales had fallen sharply due to the
freeze that damaged the Florida citrus crop.
   For the first nine months of the year, Coca-Cola said its net
income reached $1.09 billion, or $1.60 a share, up 12.5 percent
from $966.6 million, or $1.36 per share, in the first three
quarters of 1989.
   Nine-month revenue totaled $7.68 billion, up from $6.45 billion
a year earlier.

<TEXT>
   Donald Ray Dixon, whose involvement in one of the
biggest and most lurid thrift collapses in history has been
overshadowed by the cases of Neil Bush and Charles Keating, is
getting his day in court.
   Jury selection began today for the former owner of Vernon
Savings and Loan Association, which went under in 1987 at a cost of
$1.3 billion. He is charged with conspiracy, misapplication of
funds and other crimes.
   Jurors should be picked within two days, and lawyers are
expected to make opening statements Friday. Testimony is set to
begin Monday and continue three to four weeks.
   ``Perhaps when my day in court comes, if they'll listen, they'll
find out what really happened and the blame can be properly
assessed and properly assigned,'' Dixon has said.
   Prosecutors say Dixon, 50, spent hundreds of thousands in thrift
money on yachting and hunting trips, worldwide travel to gourmet
restaurants, antique cars, a California beach house, prostitutes
and contributions to politicians.
   Dixon has said the government is trying to make him a scapegoat
for the nation's S&amp;L scandal.
   Until the recent notoriety given Bush and Silverado Savings and
Loan in Colorado, or Keating and Lincoln Savings and Loan in
California, Dixon and Vernon were at or near the top of the list of
alleged abuses cited in the industry.
   Regulators have accused President Bush's 35-year-old son and
other Silverado directors of negligence. Keating faces criminal and
civil charges from his involvement at Lincoln.
   If convicted on all counts, Dixon could get 190 years in prison
and $9.5 million in fines.
   Twelve other Vernon executives and associates have been
convicted; the verdicts against two of them have been set aside.
   Dixon lived lavishly, traveling the world for gourmet parties
and acquiring along the way such playthings as a 17th Century
castle door, Baccarat crystal, sculptures, a silved-studded saddle
and a posh house near San Diego.
   The government says those luxuries, as well as payments to
political campaigns and to prostitutes who allegedly entertained
Vernon executives, were financed from the vaults at Vernon, which
owned a yacht and five planes worth $6 million.

   Civil rights leaders plan a fresh appeal to
President Bush after a major bill to combat job discrimination
cleared the Senate, but without the support needed to overcome his
threatened veto.
   ``I am convinced this bill will have the effect of forcing
businesses to adopt quotas in hiring and promotion,'' Bush said
Tuesday. He said that if the measure reached his desk, he would
``be compelled to veto it.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater reiterated that position
today, saying the bill ``is neither sound nor practical'' and would
have the effect of forcing businesses to adopt quotas in hiring and
promotion.
   The Senate on Tuesday night approved the measure, 62-34, short
of the two-thirds support that sponsors would need to override the
threatened veto.
   Fifty-three Democrats and nine Republicans joined in supporting
the measure, while 34 Republicans were opposed.
   Civil rights forces said they could count on the votes of three
absent senators and thus needed only two more to reach the 67
required for an override. But the roll call revealed that despite
many concessions they had gained no new support since July 18 when
an earlier version cleared, 65-34.
   The House was due to vote today on the bill, which would
effectively overturn six Supreme Court decisions handed down last
year. It has been the civil rights movement's top piority on
Capitol Hill in recent months.
   Provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in the
workplace to punitive damages in extreme discrimination cases.
   The major controversy, though, is over proposed changes in
complex court rules governing job discrimination lawsuits. The
changes would make it easier for those filing suit to win and
harder for employers to defend themselves.
   The administration and business critics of the bill say
employers would adopt quotas as a ready-made defense in case they
were taken to court. Sponsors of the bill scoff at this notion.
   Civil rights leaders who visited with Bush in May in an effort
to reach a compromise plan to ask for another chance to make the
pitch for the bill and head off a veto.
   ``This is going to be a defining issue for the Bush
administration and civil rights,'' said Ralph Neas, executive
director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
   He said a veto could resemble the ``Bob Jones University
fiasco,'' in which a storm erupted the Reagan administration's move
to grant tax-exempt status to that institution despite charges that
it practiced discrimination.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said, ``I believe there is a
good chance that President Bush will sign this bill. But if he
vetoes it, I think there is a good chance Congress will override
the veto.''
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who voted for the bill, held out hope
that even after months of disagreement the administration and
sponsors could reach a compromise. He said talks were getting under
way again. A summer of negotiations that were revived briefly in
September have produced nothing.
   Some lawmakers believe Bush will opt to ``pocket veto'' the
bill, allowing it to die for lack of a signature after Congress
adjourns and leaves Washington for the campaign trail.
   Both sides in the debate have acknowledged that the sheer
complexity of the measure has led to confusion.
   ``It is not ... a battle between David Duke and the rest of us
for the soul of the Republican Party,'' Sen. John C. Danforth,
R-Mo., said. ``It is a quibbling over words that lawyers have been
involved in.''
   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, was critical earlier of
Republicans for opposing the bill. ``Is this the Republican Party
of Abraham Lincoln?'' he said. ``Or is this the Republican Party of
David Duke?''
   GOP lawmakers winced at the mention of Duke, a former Ku Klux
Klan leader and current Louisiana state legislator who counts
himself as a Republican even though GOP officials have taken
enormous pains to repudiate him.
   ``I think bringing in David Duke is hitting below the belt a
bit,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
   Metzenbaum came back to the floor contritely later and said it
had been ``inappropriate and improper'' to associate Republicans
with Duke.

<HEAD>Copper Hits Two-Year Low on Prospect of Oversupply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The price of copper fell Wednesday to its lowest
level in two years on worries about future oversupply.
   ``Adequate supplies and the belief that the United States and
some of the other main copper-consumer countries are heading for
recession are behind the setback,'' said Neil Buxton, a metals
researcher at the investment house, Lehman Brothers.
   ``We are looking for the downturn to continue for the
foreseeable future,'' he said.
   Metals traders Billiton-Enthoven also forecast a further drop
because of a poor outlook for demand.
   Copper is used mainly in wires, cables and piping and brass
fittings used by the plumbing and general engineering sectors.
   The London Metal Exchange price of copper, used by most of the
world's producers as the basis for their sales contracts, was
officially set on Wednesday at 1,299.50 pounds, or $2,560 per ton,
for forward delivery.
   That was 50 pounds, or $98, below Tuesday's level and the lowest
in 25 months, traders said.
   Copper consumption has already started to slow in line with the
decline in economic growth in the main industrialized countries
triggered by soaring oil prices, said London-based metals traders
Rudolf Wolff.
   It expects demand to grow by just 1 percent this year to 8.66
million tons, compared with increases of 3 percent in 1988 and 4
percent in 1989.
   ``High interest rates have already affected the auto and
construction industries in the United States, the United Kingdom
and northern Europe,'' the firm said in a study released last week.
   Traders said that while growth in demand has slowed, production
has risen this year - despite a series of problems that caused some
shortages during the summer, including Peruvian miner strikes.
   Inventories in London Metal Exchange warehouses are just below
200,000 tons and are close to their highest level in five years,
Buxton said.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sumitomo Bank, one of the world's largest banks,
said Wednesday a vice president has resigned and it has cut pay for
24 other top executives after illegal loans were allegedly arranged
by a branch manager.
   Sumitomo vice president Teizaburo Nishi resigned to take
responsibility for not being aware of a former branch manager's
illegal conduct, the bank said.
   It added that it is cutting the salaries of 24 top executives by
as much as 50 percent for the six months starting Nov. 1.
   Meanwhile, the Japanese branch of Moody's Investors Service said
it is considering lowering its rating for Sumitomo's securities
because of concern over the bank's heavy concentration of real
estate loans, said an analyst with Moody's Japan, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Nishi's resignation followed that of Sumitomo chairman Ichiro
Isoda, also in connection with the arrest 10 days ago of Akinori
Yamashita, a former manager of Sumitomo's Yokohama branch.
   Yamashita was arrested on suspicion of having arranged 22.9
billion yen, or $182 million, in illegal loans to two groups
allegedly involved in stock manipulation.
   Mitsuhiro Kotani, head of Koshin, one of the two groups that
received illegal loans through Yamashita, has been indicted on
charges of manipulating stocks in violation of the Securities and
Exchange Law.
   Japan's Financing Law prohibits bank employees from engaging in
loan transactions outside their normal bank operations. Those
convicted face up to three years in prison and a fine of up to 3
million yen, or $23,800.
   This year, Moody's has lowered its ratings for six Japanese
banks, including Sumitomo Trust Bank, Mitsubishi Trust Bank and
Mitsui Bank, for their large number of real estate loans. It is now
considering lowering those of four others, including Sumitomo, the
analyst said.
   The stock scandal did not directly cause the review of
Sumitomo's AAA rating, Moody's highest, he added.
   Sumitomo reported total assets of 62.8 trillion yen, or $499
billion, in March 1990, putting it behind the world's largest bank,
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Japan, which reported 66.6 trillion yen, or
$529 billion, in assets.

<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines has agreed to spend $315
million to expand its operations and nearly double its workforce at
the Greater Cincinnati International Airport, officials announced
today.
   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson said the state has agreed to limit
Delta's annual sales tax liability on jet fuel to $4 million. That
would require an act of the General Assembly and Wilkinson said he
expects it to pass.
   The governor said the state also will grant tax credits worth as
much as $15 million on the airline's increase in payroll.
   The state is offering no incentive money up front for the
expansion, which is expected to add 2,800 employees to the
airline's workforce in northern Kentucky.
   The project will add 25 arrival and departure gates to the Delta
hub already in place at the airport in Boone County. The number of
gates for international departures will double to six.
   Delta Chairman Ronald W. Allen, who appeared with Wilkinson at
an airport news conference, said the expansion would be the largest
the airline has ever undertaken. Cincinnati is the airline's
fourth-largest hub, behind Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth and Salt Lake
City, and has been Delta's fastest-growing, Allen said.
   The airline is to begin construction immediately and is
scheduled to complete the project by 1994.
   Wilkinson said $4 million, the amount of the proposed sales tax
limit, is what Delta is expected to be paying at current prices in
sales tax on aviation fuel within a year. The state receives $15
million from all airlines, officials said.
   It was not immediately possible to determine the full value of
the credits and exemptions for Delta, but Allen said Delta projects
the amount of jet fuel it purchases at the airport would roughly
double.
   The sales tax limit and other elements of the incentive package
will be placed on the agenda of a planned special session of the
legislature in January, Wilkinson said.
   The tax limit would apply to any airline that invests $300
million in Kentucky and purchases at least 100 million gallons of
fuel each year in the state.

   By comparison, the nation's No. 2 long-distance phone company
earned $165 million, or 62 cents a share, in last year's third
quarter.
   MCI reported revenue of $2 billion in the quarter, compared with
$1.68 billion for the same period last year.
   The latest revenue figure reflects MCI's August acquisition of
Telecom USA Inc., the nation's fourth-largest long distance
company, for $1.25 billion.
   MCI also announced in August it was considering a writedown of
$500 million to $550 million to cover the retirement of its analog
phone network, which it is converting to modern digital lines.
   ``Without the writedown and other one-time events, MCI's profits
would have been up 14 percent over the year-ago quarter,'' said
Bert C. Roberts Jr., MCI's president and chief operating officer.
   ``Despite the challenge of smoothly integrating Telecom USA, the
company increased its share of the large account, international and
residential markets, and rolled out a new service for small to
midsize businesses.''
   In August, MCI moved up plans to have its phone network fully
digital by the end of 1991 instead of the end of 1993.
   The accelerated schedule was made possible by the acquisition of
Telecom USA, which had extensive digital lines, and by an agreement
with Williams Cos. Inc. under which each company can use the
other's phone network.
   Digital phone lines use computer language to transmit phone
calls, providing vastly clearer reception than analog lines.
   For the year's first nine months, MCI earned $172 million, or 59
cents a share, vs. $450 million, or $1.69 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue totaled $5.68 billion, vs. $4.76 billion.

   The stock market turned in a mixed showing
today, hovering just above its lowest levels in a year and a half.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 14.35 to 2,395.54
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   But losers outnumbered slightly gainers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 685 up, 725 down and
484 unchanged.
   Analysts said investors were still preoccupied with trying to
gauge how far and how deep the recession now presumed to be taking
hold in the economy might go.
   With a decline of more than 20 percent since midsummer, stock
prices are widely believed to have anticipated the effects of at
least a brief, shallow slump in business activity.
   But many observers say they are not convinced the market has
fully taken into account whatever possibility exists of a severer,
longer-lasting downturn.
   In today's economic news, the Commerce Department reported that
housing starts declined 0.6 percent in September. Industrial
production increased 0.2 percent in the same month, according to
the Federal Reserve Board.
   Citicorp led the active list, down \ at 12}. On Tuesday the
company reported a 38 percent earnings decline for the third
quarter.
   MCI Communications, the volume leader in the over-the-counter
market, dropped } to 30. The company reported a 69-cents-a-share
third-quarter loss, after a large one-time writeoff.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.72 to 164.36. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value

<HEAD>Dinner at McDonald's: Pizza and Celery?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CONNIE CASS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>OWENSBORO, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stacy McIntire and her visitors wanted
something with cheese and sauce, so they did the obvious thing at a
not-so-obvious place.
   They went out for pizza - at McDonald's.
   ``We had company over and we fed four people on two pizzas for
something like $12,'' she said. ``We went to the drive-through and
didn't even have to get out of the car. We got it in five
minutes.''
   Pizza, in the land of all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce,
cheese, pickles, onions and sesame-seed buns? Is this a fast-food
induced nightmare?
   Not at all. McDonald's, which for years counted its hamburger
sales in the billions, may soon be counting pizza, pasta and other
non-traditional offerings in an attempt to boost sluggish U.S.
dinner sales.
   Owensboro's four Golden Arches and 10 others across the Ohio
River in Evansville, Ind., are among 240 restaurants nationwide
which are test-marketing tomato pies. The 12-inch pies also are
being tested in Las Vegas; Hartford, Conn.; Fresno, Calif.; and
suburbs of Chicago.
   Fresh carrots and celery sticks are being test marketed in
Pennsylvania and California, and McDonald's also is experimenting
with fresh fruit and soups.
   ``Our customers are interested in a little more variety and more
choices,'' said Melissa Oakley, spokeswoman at McDonald's Corp.'s
Oak Brook, Ill., headquarters. ``But we have to be very careful in
what we choose. We're still committed to serving a limited menu.''
   McDonald's, held up by many as a model American corporation, has
long been committed to test marketing. Salads, the McDLT and
Chicken McNuggets made the grade; the Hulaburger, two slices of
cheese with a slice of grilled pineapple on a toasted bun, did not.
   Ms. Oakley noted that McDonald's tested salads for 10 years
before introducing them in all of its 8,500 U.S. restaurants.
   But Michael Mueller, a Montgomery Securities Inc. analyst who
specializes in restaurants, says McDonald's has reasons to press
ahead with pizza now - investors' complaints about the company's
recent U.S. sales growth.
   A pattern of progressively weaker domestic sales growth began in
1988 after peaking at 11.6 percent in 1987. A selloff of the
company's stock followed release of second quarter results showing
domestic sales of $6 billion for the first half of 1990, a
3.3-percent increase from the first half of 1989.
   ``From their standpoint they have to do something to boost
dinner sales,'' Mueller said. ``This (pizza) is better than
nothing.''
   But is it better than Tony's, or Vito's, or Sal's?
   ``If you like pizza, it's just not right,'' said Elaine Lillpop
of Rockport, Ind. ``It's a hurry-up job.''
   She complained that the pepperoni pizza she bought in Owensboro
tasted burned and didn't have enough cheese. Her 8-year-old
daughter, Kari, said she didn't like it either.
   Gail Thompson of Owensboro said she won a free pizza and liked
it, but wouldn't buy another.
   ``I love pizza but I don't particularly like eating it in this
atmosphere,'' she said between bites of a burger. ``It's not fast
food to me.''
   That, says Mueller, is the problem. Pizza doesn't follow the
rules that helped make McDonald's the world's largest restaurant
chain.
   ``In the past they've been successful introducing products that
are cheap, easy to eat, and come with quick service at the
drive-through window,'' said the San Francisco-based analyst.
``Pizza is expensive, hard to eat in the car, and takes five
minutes or more to get.''
   Pizza also requires special ovens and is more difficult to make.
And there are lots of competitors already established in the pizza
market, Mueller said.
   Another restaurant analyst, Roy Burry of Kidder Peabody in New
York, acknowledged the problems. But he expressed confidence that
McDonald's would find a fast-food pizza that works.
   ``They've been on track for five or six years with this,'' he
said. ``It takes a long time to get it right, which of course they
will.''
   Pizza was a logical choice, Burry said. The demand for more
traditional fast food is not keeping pace with the number of new
restaurants, he said.
   ``Pizza is the only fast food product that's growing,'' he said.
``It's a mammoth market. It offers major potential for them.''
   Burry predicted the pizza might be ready for a national rollout
within two years. The test likely will be expanded to more markets
next year, he said.
   Ms. Oakley said McDonald's has not yet decided the product's
fate.
   She said pizza is doing ``very well,'' although the company
won't discuss sales figures. Pizza Hut, the largest pizza chain,
maintains that McDonald's holds only 2 percent of sales in the
Owensboro-Evansville market.
   Evansville workers said sales have been sporadic. A cheese pizza
recently sold there for $4.99. The Deluxe, with cheese, sausage,
pepperoni, green peppers, onion, tomato and mushrooms, sold for
$7.99. Some restaurants sell pizza only after 4 p.m.; some offer
quarter-pie slices for lunch.
   The Owensboro restaurants lure pizza buyers with glass windows
that allow customer to watch sausage and pepperoni being spread by
hand. But they don't see dough lovingly kneaded and tossed.
   McDonald's sacrificed fresh dough for frozen in its attempt to
make pizza a fast food. Some customers say the dough will be the
pizza's downfall.
   ``It tastes like cardboard,'' said 16-year-old Josh Hamburg of
Owensboro.

<HEAD>Nicaraguan Bank Workers Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of bank workers struck
Wednesday to demand pay raises, another sign of continuing unrest
over government austerity policies.
   The strike by the 12,000-member Association of Bank Employees
affected all of the country's 197 bank branches, including the
Central Bank.
   The walkout capmaller job actions by bank
workers, who are demanding job security, rule changes and increased
bank capitalization in additions two weeks of s to higher pay.
   The bank union is part of the leftist Sandinista Front, which
ruled Nicaragua for a decade until losing power in an election this
year. The unions led massive nationwide strikes in May and July
against government economic plans.
   Last week, it withdrew from talks with the government and
businessmen aimed at reaching agreement on how to tackle the
country's economic crisis, in which inflation has risen 4,000
percent this year.
   Sandinista work agreed to all the proposals I made and we agreed to
the
proposals that he has made,'' Vessey said with Thach standing at
his side.
   Vessey said technical cooperation for joint investigations was
agreed to, as well as ways to seek information and to return the
remains of U.S. servicemen.
   He said the two sides ``agreed to new levels of cooperation to
resolve the fates of the missing in action in Southeast Asia.''
   A joint team will be formed to examine the specifics of the new
forms of cooperation, Vessey said. Also participating in the
discussions was Anne Mills Griffiths, head of a group of families
of missing Americans.
   Thach is the first Hanoi official of his rank to visit
Washington since Vietnam's independence 36 years ago.
   A State Department announcement had said the subject matter to
be discussed was to be limited to the POW-MIA issue. In response to
a question, Thach said there were no American war prisoners in
government custody.
   Thach's ground-breaking visit is consistent with a pattern of
improving relations that dates back to July when the Bush
administration agreed to open discussions with Vietnam for the
first time on resolving the conflict in neighboring Cambodia.
   Earlier, U.S.-Vietnamese contacts had been limited to
humanitarian issues.
   The visit comes at a time of fading American bitterness toward
Hanoi about the loss of more than 55,000 U.S. servicemen in the
Vietnam conflict. A Time-CNN poll this past spring showed Americans
support diplomatic relations by a 48-32 margin.
   Thach, 66, is a leading proponent of normal ties with the United
States and has been promoting that goal recently in interviews with
American reporters.
   As the participants in the discussion posed for photographers at
the Army-Navy Club, about 20 Vietnamese demonstrators stood outside
chanting slogans in support of democracy and a market economy for
Vietnam.
   Thach also planned separate meetings this afternoon with members
of the foreign relations committees of the Senate and the House.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III met with Thach three weeks
ago in New York and then agreed to facilitate Thach's visit to
Washington by waiving the rule that limits Vietnamese diplomats to
a 25-mile radius of New York City.
   The Baker-Thach meeting was the first high-level contact between
the two countries in 17 years.
   The Bush administration has linked a normalization of relations
with Vietnam to Hanoi's cooperation in obtaining an accounting of
the missing Americans and in achieving a settlement of the
Cambodian conflict.
   Ms. Griffiths said she believes Vietnam could do far more in
helping account for American servicemen than it has.
   ``There's no question but that greater responsiveness would
resolve hundreds of cases of Americans who are missing,'' she says.
   The United States has never recognized the communist government
that assumed power in Hanoi in 1954 after the end of French
colonial rule. Thach is well-known to U.S. diplomats as one of the
principal negotiators of the agreement that led to the withdrawal
of American forces from Vietnam in 1973.
   Any possibility of a U.S.-Vietnamese rapprochement in the
aftermath were dashed when Hanoi's army conquered the U.S.-backed
government in South Vietnam two years after the 1973 agreement.
Subsequently, Vietnam was reunified under Hanoi's rule.
   Relations with Vietnam were further soured when Hanoi invaded
Cambodia in late 1978. Successive U.S. administrations campaigned
for years for a Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia.
   Vietnam said all of its forces were withdrawn a year ago but
U.S. officials said some have since returned to Cambodia.
   Despite U.S. objections to Vietnam's role in Cambodia, both
sides agree the Khmer Rouge, responsible for the deaths of over 1
million Cambodians in the 1970s, should not return to power.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. on Wednesday reported a
20.7 percent increase in net income for the third quarter, with
strong sales in its pharmaceutical business and overseas.
   Richard L. Gelb, the company's chairman and chief executive
officer, said favorable foreign exchange rates also helped net
income increase to a record $495.9 million, or 94 cents a share, in
the quarter ended Sept. 30.
   That compares with net earnings of $410.7 million or 78 cents a
share in the third quarter of 1989.
   Sales rose 13 percent to a record $2.6 billion in the quarter,
from $2.3 billion last year. Gelb said international sales rose 20
percent, while domestic sales increased 9 percent. Pharmaceutical
sales rose 23 percent.
   For the first nine months of the year, net earnings rose 20.3
percent to $1.32 billion or $2.51 a share, from $1.099 billion or
$2.10 a share.
   Sales rose 10.8 percent to $7.56 billion from $6.83 billion.

<TEXT>
   Van de Kamp's Holland Dutch Bakery, a
regional baker with a 100-item line of goods, has closed and laid
off nearly all its 500 workers, union officials and a lawyer for
the company have announced.
   The 75-year-old bakery filed for protection from its creditors
in August under federal bankruptcy law provisions. It listed $42.7
million in liabilities and $15 million in assets.
   David Gill,an attorney for the company, would not elaborate,
and company officials did not return telephone calls for comment
Wednesday.
   Andrea Zinder, research director for the United Food and
Commercial Workers Union local 770, which represents some of Van de
Kamp's sales staff, said Van de Kamp employees told her the bakery
was shut for good.
   She and other union officials said the bakery dismissed most of
its employees last week.
   ``From what I wGonzalez told Brady:
   ``This is a shocking interpretation of a Cabinet officer's
responsibility.
   ``I know that you recognize that members of the committee have a
right and responsibility to seek responses from the administration
concerning the assumptions beneath the requested amount. ...
   ``As arduous as this may be for the administration, it is not a
process from which the secretary can be exempted.''
   The Senate Banking Committee last week endorsed spending $57
billion more for the bailout - $40 billion to cover S&amp;L losses and
$17 billion in reserve funds. It acted after receiving a fresh
letter from Brady.
   Legislators in the House, however, are being less understanding.
While there has been no talk of subpoenaing Brady, several
committee members are threatening to vote against more S&amp;L money
unless Brady appears.
   ``There has been a very disturbing pattern of trying to
circumvent any kind of congressional oversight'' of the savings and
loan bailout, said Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass.
   ``If they (administration officials) run out of money because we
want to be prudent as to how we provide it, then that's up to them.
I'm not going to vote for any money for an organization where we
have no idea of how the funds are flowing,'' he said.
   The Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now,
ACORN, a consumer activist group, is urging the committee to block
the second round of bailout financing unless it takes steps to
reform the cleanup process.
   Gonzalez, meanwhile, is threatening to oppose more financing
unless the cleanup agency, the Resolution Trust Corp., ceases its
practice of protecting virtually all deposits, even uninsured
deposits, when a thrift fails.

   The maker of Bunnies Biodegradable Disposable
Diapers has agreed to stop claiming that its product is good for

Wednesday.
   The company had claimed that ``Bunnies and the plastic bag they

   But Abrams asserted that Bunnies, ``like any organic waste, will
take decades to degrade in our nation's landfills.''
   Abrams, as lead attorney for 10 states, said Bunnies' maker,
American Enviro Products Inc. of Placentia, Calif., also agreed to
pay $50,000 to the states for costs and to change the design of the
diaper so that it really does have less of an impact on the
environment.
   ``This is a significant settlement because it is the first
multistate agreement in the `green-marketing' area to actually
reach a cash settlement and move a company in a positive
direction,'' Abrams said.
   Bunnies has been on the market about a year and a half and
nationally represents about 1 or 2 percent of the market, said the
company's president, Robert Chickering.
   The action was joined by the attorneys general of California,
Florida, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Texas. Utah,

   The dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen
Wednesday and finished mixed against other major currencies in busy
trading.
   Gold prices inched higher after tumbling more than $25 an ounce
earlier this week. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for
current delivery fetched $366.70 a troy ounce, up $4.70 from
Tuesday. Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for bullion of
$366.10 an ounce, up $2.10.
   Much attention focused on the Japanese yen, which rose
significantly against the dollar. Traders said Japanese portfolio
managers are bringing their money home in an effort to support a
weakening stock market and banks that have suffered declines in
their capital ratios.
   ``People expect (Japan's) Ministry of Finance to keep yen
interest rates fairly high,'' which attracts investors, said Bob
Morrissey, senior trader at the Bank of Boston's office here.
   In addition, there is the belief that ``U.S. and Japanese
officials have agreed to an orderly dollar decline, and they have
been tolerating it,'' said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   The dollar fell sharply in Tokyo, where the U.S. currency
settled at 125.80 Japanese yen, down from 128.05 yen on Tuesday.
Later in London, it fell further to 124.85 yen. In New York, the
dollar closed off its lows at 125.43 yen but still was down from
126.79 yen on Tuesday.
   Traders said a government report showing a better-than-expected
0.2 percent rise in industrial production during September helped
put a floor under the dollar even though a 7.5 percent spurt in
automobile production masked overall weakness in manufacturing.
   The report hinted that there may be less room for the Federal
Reserve to east interest rates. Higher interest rates tend to
support the dollar by making dollar-denominated securities more
attractive to investors.
   Some traders spent part of the session squaring up their
positions ahead of another slew of economic data - the government
will report Thursday on September's consumer prices and merchandise
trade figures for August.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.9650 from $1.9575 late
Tuesday. In New York it cost $1.9615 to buy one pound, less
expensive than Tuesday's $1.9655.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's rates included: 1.5125 German marks, up from 1.5115;
1.2720 Swiss francs, down from 1.2770; 5.0680 French francs, up
from 5.0660; 1,132.50 Italian lire, down from 1,132.75, and 1.1683
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1564.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates included: 1.5105 German marks, down from 1.5145; 1.2725 Swiss
francs, down from 1.2780; 5.0588 French francs, down from 5.0732;
1.7015 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7070; 1,130.75 Italian lire,
down from 1,134.25, and 1.1646 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1551.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $366.50 a troy ounce
from $364.25 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a
closing bid of $366.20 from $362. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell
8.52 cents to close at a bd $367.81.
   Silver prices also rose. On New York's Comex, silver for current
delivery settled at $4.198 a troy ounce, up from Tuesday's $4.142.
In London the metal rose to a late bid price of $4.24 a troy ounce
from $4.23.

<HEAD>`Horizontal' Oil Well Could Spur Boom in Wyoming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA PRODIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ``super highway'' of oil has been tapped
in southeastern Wyoming by a drilling technique that could spur an
oil boom in the region, a petroleum expert said Wednesday.
   The find announced Wednesday by Union Pacific Resources Co., of
Fort Worth, Texas, lies in the Niobrara Formation 18 miles
northeast of Cheyenne.
   A 21-hour test of the well produced 1,462 barrels of crude, the
greatest daily production of any Wyoming well, according to
officials.
   The company, a subsidiary of Union Pacific Corp., achieved the
results by boring into the formation horizontally instead of using
traditional vertical techniques which would have produced as little
as 50 barrels per day, according to Chuck Farmer, a petroleum
engineer with the Wyoming Oil and Gas Commission.
   The find ``will result in a mini-boom,'' he said.
   Unlike vertical wells that bore straight down and miss pockets
of oil on either side of the well, horizontal wells start
vertically but the drill bit gradually is turned 90 degrees to
traverse the rock formation. This enables the drill to encounter

<HEAD>Oil Prices Fall on Supply Concerns, Technical Factors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crude oil prices tumbled more than $2 a barrel
Wednesday as the energy futures market, though still sensitive to
developments out of the Middle East, temporarily ran out of steam.
   Traders were preoccupied with supply-and-demand concerns.
   The November contract for light sweet crude oil slumped $2.17 to
$36.72 a 42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Later contract months also fell sharply.
   With no substantive developments from the Persian Gulf to
influence trading, the market was swayed by reports that crude was
going unsold in spot markets. The reports indicated low demand for
oil from refineries, which are currently retooling to turn out more
heating oil rather than gasoline for the winter months.
   Wednesday's drop was something of a surprise after the previous
session, when crude prices rose nearly $1 on expectations that the
American Petroleum Institute's weekly report on inventories -
issued after the close of trading Tuesday - would indicate a
decline in stockpiles.
   Tha is exactly what the API reported. The trade group said
domestic crude inventories fell to 343.3 million barrels in the
week ended Oct. 12 from 349.5 million a week earlier, with most of
the decline coming from a major reduction in imports.
   The API report sent oil prices higher overseas, but when the
U.S. market opened, prices fell.
   Technical factors also figured into Wednesday's session. As the
price of crude fell through psychological points known as support
levels, selling began to accelerate, analysts said.
   Analysts said the market has lost some of its frenzy since the
November contract for crude was unable to break through the
$41-a-barrel mark last week.
   But they were quick to caution that despite declines like
Wednesday's, the market retains most of its bullishness and it is
still hypersensitive to any negative developments in the Persian
Gulf.
   ``It could rocket up if war breaks out,'' said Jim Fiedler, an
analyst with E. D. &amp; F. Man International Futures Inc. who called
Wednesday's drop ``a correction to a bull market.''
   Prices for refined products also fell sharply Wednesday.
   Home heating oil for November delivery plunged 5.75 cents to
98.25 cents a gallon despite the approaching winter weather. Later
contract months also fell sharply.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for delivery in November skidded
4.48 cents to 93.40 cents a gallon, with subsequent months also
dropping.
   In natural gas trading, the November contract closed at $1.900
per 1,000 cubic feet, down from $1.910 on Tuesday.

<HEAD>UTC Reports 22 Percent Rise in Third-quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Technologies Corp. on Wednesday
reported a 22 percent increase in third-quarter earnings, citing a
$46.5 million gain from unloading its majority interest in two
Italian automotive companies.
   Net earnings for the third quarter totalled $239.8 million, or
$1.90 per share, on revenues of $5.3 billion. That compares with
earnings of $196.7 million, or $1.46 per share, on revenues of $4.8
billion for the same period last year.
   ``I am particularly pleased with the strength of our
performance, especially in light of the poor economic environment
and the weakness in the U.S. residential housing and automotive
markets,'' said Robert F. Daniell, UTC's chairman and chief
executive officer.
   The company reported a one-time pre-tax gain of $46.5 million
from the sale of its 75 percent interest in Italian automotive
firms Diavia and Aura. Without that gain, earnings would have
increased 7.5 percent in the third quarter, the company said.
   UTC reported decreased earnings in its two largest segments in
the quarter. Its power segment, which includes Pratt &amp; Whitney,
posted earnings of $242 million, a $39 million decrease from 1989.
   The decline reflected a slight cooling of last year's record jet
engine sales and a one-time gain of more than $40 million when
several of Pratt &amp; Whitney's overseas partners increased their
interest in joint projects, said UTC spokesman Peter Kowalchuk.
   Operating profits from the building systems segment, which
includes its Carrier Air Conditioning and Otis Elevator
subsidiaries, were down $15 million to $138 million, due in part to
the nation's housing slump, the company said.
   The corporation saw improvements in its flight systems segment,
which includes both Sikorsky Helicopter and Windsor Locks-based
Hamilton Standard. Flight systems posted earnings of $50 million
for the quarter, compared with a $34 million loss in the 1989
period.
   The industrial segment also gained, posting a net $65 million in
earnings, up from $39 million. The figure was inflated, however, by
the sale of UTC's interest in the Italian automotive firms.
   Profits for the first nine months rose 12 percent to $581.8
million, or $4.59 per share, compared with $517.7 million, or $3.91
a share during the same period in 1989. Revenues rose to $15.8
billion from $14.5 billion.
   UTC provides high-technology products and support services for
the aerospace, building systems and automotive industries. Its
products include Pratt &amp; Whitney aircraft engines, Carrier heating
and air-conditioning systems, Otis elevators and escalators,
Sikorsky helicopters, Hamilton Standard aerospace systems and
Norden defense systems.

<HEAD>2nd Eastern Employee Pleads Guilty in Maintenance Scheme</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONALD POWERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A second Eastern Airlines foreman at Kennedy
Airport has quietly pleaded guilty to falsifying aircraft safety
and maintenance records and has agreed to cooperate with
authorities, according to court records.
   Michael Hennessey, Eastern's general foreman at the airport,
admitted to conspiring with other airline employees to falsify log
books, work cards and computer records in a scheme that allegedly
allowed unsafe aircraft to carry passengers.
   Hennessey, who faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison
and a $250,000 fine, pleaded guilty at an Oct. 9 hearing before
U.S. District Judge I. Leo Glasser of Brooklyn.
   An Eastern spokeswoman, Karen Ceremsak, said the airline had no
comment on Hennessey's plea.
   ``A cooperation agreement was filed as part of his plea
agreement,'' Hennessey's lawyer, Henry Putzel, said Wednesday. ``He
has been and will continue to be fully cooperative with the
government.''
   Hennessey - who was not charged in a 60-count criminal
indictment that was unsealed in July and accuses the airline and
several top managers of routinely ignoring vital repairs - pleaded
guilty and remains free on his own recognizance.
   Hennessey and the other defendants caused ``aircraft that were
not properly maintained and repaired to fly and carry unsuspecting
passengers,'' court documents alleged.
   According to court records, the scheme was directed by two top
Eastern executives. Former Vice President Edward Upton and Thomas
Lewis, who was the maintenance director of Eastern's Northern
region airports, allegedly employed ``intimidation and coercion''
to force company workers ``to avoid and minimize flight delays and
cancellations by falsifying aircraft maintenance records.''
   Prosecutors allege that records were altered to make it appear
scheduled maintenance and corrective repairs had been done when in
fact they had not been.
   Hennessey also admitted to lying to Federal Aviation
Administration authorities investigating the Eastern scheme, which
allegedly took place from July 1985 to October 1989 at Kennedy and
La Guardia airports in New York, Hartsfield International Airport
in Atlanta and Eastern headquarters in Miami.
   The criminal indictment was unprecedented in the airline
industry and came as Eastern was trying to rebuild its faltering
service, regain passengers and reorganize in bankruptcy court after
bitter labor disputes.
   The case is scheduled to go to trial at the federal courthouse
in Brooklyn in January.
   In July, a former Eastern foreman named in the indictment
pleaded guilty and agreed to testify.
   Elia Dragone of Jersey City, N.J., the first Eastern employee to
plead guilty, said the scheme was orchestrated by his superiors at
the airline.
   He admitted to conspiracy and obstructing an FAA investigation
into the airline.

<HEAD>Orange Juice Futures Skid Further After Brazilian Price Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Orange juice futures prices dropped to new four-year lows
Wednesday amid speculation that Brazilian processers will dump more
frozen concentrate onto the U.S. market in a shakeout stemming from
a large Florida crop forecast.
   On other commodity markets, petroleum prices fell sharply;
precious metals rose; grains and soybeans were higher; and
livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   All contracts for future deliveries of frozen concentrated
orange juice plunged the permitted daily limit of 5 cents a pound
on the New York Cotton Exchange except the November contract, which
has an expanded limit and fell 5.85 cents to $1.12 a pound. The
November settlement was the lowest for a near-month orange juice
contract since Oct. 16, 1986.
   Near-term orange juice has fallen by about 18 cents, or 14
percent, since last Thursday, when the Agriculture Department
projected a 50 percent increase in Florida orange production this
season compared with last year's frost-shriveled crop.
   ``The market continues to fall toward a dollar in the aftermath
of the crop report,'' said Sandra Kaul, orange juice analyst with
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   Juice from Brazil made up for the U.S. shortfall last season,
when the Florida freeze pushed prices to near record highs. But
major Brazilian processers began cutting their prices soon after
the report, including a 25 discount to U.S. customers on Monday,
said analyst Celeste Georkakis of Cargill Investor Services Inc.
   She said the price cuts already are causing turbulence among
smaller Brazilian processers.
   ``We understand that two have filed for bankruptcy and one has
asked the government for financial help,'' Georkakis said.
   Oil futures tumbled on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid
persistent perceptions that the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait might be
resolved peacefully.
   ``You have seen a pretty hefty war premium put into this market.
I think what you're seeing today is some of that war premium being
eroded,'' said Stephen W. Platt, energy analyst Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   Light sweet crude oil settled $1.26 to $2.17 lower with November
at $36.72 a barrel; wholesale heating oil was 3 cents to 5.75 cents
lower with November at 98.25 cents a gallon; wholesale unleaded
gasoline was 3 cents to 4.48 cents lower with November at 93.40
cents a gallon.
   Gold futures rebounded moderately after three straight days of
steep losses on New York's Commodity Exchange. Analysts said the
rally was an overdue correction.
   Gold finished $4.60 to $4.70 higher with October at $366.70 a
troy ounce; silver was 4.8 cents to 5.6 cents higher with October
at $4.19 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures rose moderately on the Chicago Board
of Trade, erasing the previous day's losses amid news that the
Soviet Union bought 350,000 metric tons of U.S. corn and China is
seeking to buy 300,000 metric tons of subsidized U.S. winter wheat.
   Corn and soybean futures also were supported by a threat of
harvest delays and crop damage from a powerful storm system that
was expected to bring high winds, rain and snow to the Midwest
beginning Wednesday.
   Wheat futures settled 1} cents to 2} cents higher with December
at $2.63{ a bushel; corn was 1} cents to 2\ cents higher with
December at $2.28} a bushel; oats were 4\ cents higher across the
board with December at $1.23\ a bushel; soybeans were { cent to 4\
cents higher with November at $6.14{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures ended mostly higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, boosted by firm cash markets.
   Hog futures were mixed but most pork belly contracts soared the
permitted daily limit of 2 cents a pound on new indications of
tight supplies.
   Live cattle futures settled .05 cent to .45 cent higher with
October at 79.02 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent lower
to .25 cent higher with October at 86.80 cents a pound; live hogs
were .15 cent lower to .43 cent higher with October at 57.10 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.75 cents to 2 cents higher with
February at 66.70 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   Ames Department Stores Inc., the ailing
discount chain that filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this
year, said Wednesday it will lay off 250 corporate employees and
close offices in West Hartford and Syracuse, N.Y.
   The Rocky Hill-based company said it already has eliminated 200
corporate positions through attrition over the past four months.
The company has 1,600 corporate employees.
   Both moves are part of the company's plan to reduce costs as it
struggles to recover under bankruptcy protection. The bulk of the
layoffs - 160 - will be from Syracuse, N.Y.
   Ames said the West Hartford merchandising operations and
Syracuse, N.Y., finance operation will be relocated in Rocky Hill
next spring.
   Ames filed for protection from its creditors April 25. The
filing under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code allows the
company to remain in business while it works out a plan to repay
its creditors.
   Since filing for bankruptcy protection, the company has closed
219 stores and laid off about 18,000 employees.

   Bond prices finished little changed Wednesday,
influenced by mixed economic reports, more Middle East uncertainty,
unresolved budget talks in Washington and plans for a record 2-year
Treasury note auction.
   The Treasury's key 30-year issue rose about $1 per $1,000 in
face amount. Its yield, which falls when the price rises, eased to
8.88 percent from 8.89 percent late Tuesday.
   Bond strategists said Commerce Department reports showing
weakness in the housing industry but rising industrial production
in September injected some confusion into the market because they
signaled signs of recession and growth at the same time.
   ``That jerked it around a little bit,'' said Micheal Casey, a
bond economist at Maria Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc., a New
York investment concern. ``There were various conflicting stories
out of the Mideast that knocked it around a little bit, too.''
   All financial markets have been fixated on developments in the
Persian Gulf since Iraq seized Kuwait more than two months ago,
provoking a crisis that has nearly doubled the price of oil and
raised fears of both recession and oil-shock inflation in the
United States, which imports half its petroleum.
   On Tuesday, bond prices rose slightly on speculation that
diplomacy might help resolve the Mideast crisis, but that thinking
seemed to disappear Wednesday, partly on Secretary of State James
A. Baker III's remarks that Iraq's Saddam Hussein ``must fail if
peace is to succeed.''
   Bond strategists said the persistent inability of Congress and
the Bush administration to overcome differences in closing the
federal budget gap also was creating uncertainty in the market.
   President Bush has threatened to shut the government down again
Saturday unless Congress sends him a budget he can accept. Without
emergency legislation, federal authority to spend money expires
that day, and would prevent the Treasury from borrowing.
   ``The Treasury's like a junkie for money,'' Casey said. ``That's
hanging over the market.''
   William Veronda, a fixed-income strategist for Financial
Programs Inc. in Denver, said additional bond market uncertainty
stemmed from the Treasury's plan to auction a record $12 billion in
2-year notes later this month. That helped depress some short-term
government bond prices, he said.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term and
medium-term maturities were unchanged to 1-32 point lower, while
long-term issues were up about 3-32 point, the Telerate Inc.
financial information service reported.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.20 to 1,150.06.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.40 percent as the
discount rose 2 basis point to 7.18 percent. Yields on six-month
bills remained unchanged at 7.57 percent as the discount remained
at 7.20 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 7.59 percent as
the discount rose 3 basis points to 7.11 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 6 percent, down from 7 15-16 percent late Tuesday.
The drop was due to internal market factors and was not considered
a sign of easing by the Federal Reserve.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose &lsqb; point. The average yield to maturity
fell to 7.81 percent from 7.83 percent late Tuesday.

   The House on Wednesday approved a major civil
rights bill designed to combat job discrimination and sent it to
President Bush, who promised a veto on grounds that it would lead
to hiring quotas.
   ``I hope that President Bush will reconsider the unwise and
unjustified course he is on,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
said following House approval of the bill, 273-154.
   The margin was 12 votes short of the two-thirds needed to
override a veto and pass the bill over the president's objections.
Thirty-four Republicans and 239 Democrats voted for the bill while
15 Democrats and 139 Republicans were opposed.
   Despite months of efforts for forge a compromise, civil rights
forces succeeded in gaining just one vote beyond their total on
Aug. 3 when the House passed an earlier version 272-154.
   ``We're somewhat disappointed because we had hoped that the
additional compromises that were made since the vote last time
would have picked up some votes,'' said William Taylor, a longtime
Washington civil rights advocate.
   The Senate on Tuesday approved the bill but also fell short of
the support needed to override a veto. Somber civil rights forces
planned a final campaign to persuade Bush to relent and sign the
bill.
   ``Give us these measly crumbs from the table,'' Rep. Craig
Washington, D-Texas, said as the House debated the measure, which
had been nine months in the making and softened repeatedly in
efforts to woo Bush's support.
   The bill represents the civil rights movement's top priority on
Capitol Hill this year. It would overturn six decisions on job
discrimination that created a furor when the Supreme Court handed
them down last year.
   Provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in the
workplace to punitive damages in extreme discrimination cases.
   The greatest controversy, however, came over complex changes in
rules on how job discrimination cases are decided. They would make
it easier for minorities filing suit to win and harder for
employers to defend themselves.
   President Bush said in a letter delivered to Capitol Hill on
Tuesday that the changes would ``have the effect of forcing
businesses to adopt quotas in hiring and promotion.'' He said that
if the bill reached his desk, he would ``be compelled to veto it.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday
morning that Bush planned to veto the measure and send it back to
lawmakers with an alternative version attached. Civil rights
leaders, however, have been saying the chances of passing an
alternative this year are virtually nil.
   In recent months, they had been holding out hope that Bush would
relent and sign the bill. After weighing Tuesday's missive from the
president, however, civil rights leaders sharpened their rhetoric.
   ``His announced intention to veto the Civil Rights Act of 1990
shows that on issues of race and sex discrimination, George Bush is
a Ronald Reagan in sheep's clothing,'' said Ralph Neas, executive
director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
   ``While his style and rhetoric may differ, his substantive civil
rights policies are just as deadly to those who are victims of job
discrimination,'' Neas said. Indeed, with respect to key parts of
the Civil Rights Act of 1990, President Bush's positions are even
more extreme than Ronald Reagan's.''
   ``Regrettably, President Bush has capitulated to the right
wing,'' he said.
   There is nothing in the bill that would require employers to
hire by quota. In fact, the measure contains a disclaimer
specifically saying that it would not ``encourage'' the use of
quotas.
   Business groups and Bush administration officials say, however,
that the bill would make employers so vulnerable to discrimination
suits that they would turn to quotas to provide themselves with a
ready-made defense in case they were taken to court.
   Civil rights forces tried in vain for months to dispel this
notion, saying the measure would do no more than restore the law to
what it was before last year's decision in a case called Wards Cove
versus Atonio, involving employment practices at a salmon cannery
in Alaska.
   Supporters also said strong support for a civil rights bill was
needed to show congressional disapproval of an upsurge in acts of
bigotry by neo-Nazi groups and others. They cited a surprising
showing in recent Louisiana primary voting for former Ku Klux Klan
leader David Duke.
   ``David Duke was not a fluke,'' Rep. Patricia Schroeder,
D-Colo., said.

<TEXT>
   Pacific Telesis Group and Ameritech said Wednesday their
third-quarter profits rose, while earnings softened slightly at
another regional telephone holding company, BellSouth Corp.
   Pacific Telesis, which owns the primary phone companies in
California and Nevada, said its third-quarter profit rose 2.5
percent to $285 million, or 72 cents a share, compared with $278
million, or 68 cents a share, in last year's third quarter.
   Revenue totaled $2.47 billion, up from $2.37 billion in the same
period of 1989.
   Pacific Telesis said gains in its cellular phone business and
other services helped offset state-ordered rate cuts at Pacific
Bell, a subsidiary.
   For the first nine months of the year, the San Francisco-based
company reported a profit of $834 million, or $2.09 a share, down
from $920 million, or $2.23 a share, a year earlier. Revenue
totaled $7.28 billion, vs. $7.12 billion.

   Chicago-based Ameritech, which owns five phone companies in the

share, a year earlier.
   Revenue totaled $2.7 billion, up from $2.6 billion in the
year-earlier period.
   For the first nine months, Ameritech earned $967 million, or
$3.64 a share, up from $907 million, or $3.37 a share, a year
earlier. Revenue totaled $7.97 billion, up from $7.61 billion.

   Atlanta-based BellSouth said its third-quarter earnings totaled
$402.9 million, or 84 cents a share, compared with $404.4 million,
also 84 cents a share, for the same quarter of 1989. Revenue
totaled $3.551 billion, up from $3.545 billion.
   ``Earnings continue to be dampened by rate reductions, but these
reductions primarily reflect the costs of adopting incentive
regulatory plans,'' said John L. Clendenin, BellSouth's chairman
and chief executive officer.
   ``Such plans hold long-term benefits for customers and
shareholders by providing economic motivation to accelerate the
introduction of new services and improve operating efficiencies,''
he said.
   During the quarter, state regulatory commissions in Georgia and
Tennessee agreed to adopt various forms of incentive-based plans.
   For the first nine months, BellSouth earned $1.271 billion, or
$2.64 a share, down slightly from $1.272 billion, or $2.67 a share,
last year.

percent drop in profit in the third quarter as its interest expense
soared and its building products business weakend.
   The wood and paper company reported net income of $95 million,
or $1.11 per share, on sales of $3.4 billion for the three months
that ended Sept. 30. In the same period last year, profit was $178
million, or $5.58 per share, on sales of $2.6 billion.
   The buyout of Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. helped boost sales,
but Georgia Pacific's interest expense rose from $65 million in the
third quarter of 1989 to $163 million in the most recent quarter.
   Building products profits dropped in the quarter on lower
prices, said T. Marshall Hahn Jr., chairman and chief executive
officer. Plywood prices dropped 15 percent from the same period a
year ago, he said.
   Pulp and paper profits improved, despite generally lower prices,
he said.
   ``Demand and pricing for tissue and communication papers remains
strong,'' Hahn said.
   For the nine-month period, net income was $303 million compared
with $504 million for the same period in 1989. Earnings per share
were $3.54 in 1990 compared to $5.58 a year ago.

<HEAD>Venezuelan Computer Company Sues AT&amp;T for Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Venezuelan computer company has sued American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. seeking $90 million in damages, claiming
AT&amp;T tried to put the company out of business and monopolize the
phone and computer industries in Venezuela.
   The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Manhattan by C.A.
Westel de Venezuela, a former distributor of AT&amp;T products in the
South American nation.
   According to a statement from Westel, the suit claims AT&amp;T
induced the company into buying obsolete or broken AT&amp;T equipment
at inflated prices, then slandered the company by telling its
customers that it was at fault for problems with the equipment.
   The suit also alleges AT&amp;T attempted to monopolize the
telecommunications and computer industries in Venezuela ``through a
pattern of racketeering activity'' and ``in furtherance of a scheme
to defraud,'' according to the statement.
   In addition, the suit claims that AT&amp;T stole telephone
technology developed by Westel.
   ``We haven't seen the suit yet, but we have had differences with
this company in recent times that led to the end of our
relationswhip with them early this year,'' said AT&amp;T spokesman Andy
Myers, reading from a statement.

<HEAD>Northrop Profit Rises 97 Percent on Strength in Electronics Area</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northrop Corp. said Wednesday its
third-quarter profit nearly doubled, largely because of a strong
turnaround in its electronics division.
   During the quarter that ended Sept. 30, the B-2 bomber maker
earned $42.4 million, or 90 cents per share, compared with $21.5
million, or 46 cents per share, during the third quarter of 1989.
   The electronics division, which lost $2 million during the same
period of 1989, had an operating profit of $19.5 million this year.
   Northrop's sales rose by 2.5 percent, from $1.25 billion to
$1.28 billion. Northrop said production on the first few B-2s
increased slightly. The work volume also rose in the missile and
unmanned vehicles systems and electronic countermeasures areas. It
tailed off for MX missile guidance systems.
   Sales for the first nine months of 1990 rose 1.2 percent to
$3.97 billion.
   Net income for the first nine months totaled $167.7 million, or
$3.57 per share, including an after-tax gain of $67.1 million, or
$1.42 a share, from the sale of Northrop's headquarters complex in
Century City.
   That compared with a loss of $46.9 million in the first nine
months of 1989, the equivalent of $1 per share. That loss included
a $150 million pretax loss provision for a classified, fixed-price
research and development contract in the missiles and unmanned
vehicles division.
   The loss at Northrop's electronics division in the third quarter
of 1989 also came because of provisions for losses on fixed-price
research and development contracts. Northrop had $15 million in
such loss provisions in the electronics division that quarter.

   Conrail Wednesday reported a 17.2 percent
drop in profit in the third quarter as the freight railroad
finished a massive stock buy-back intended to guard against any
unwanted takeover.
   Net income totaled $72 million, or $1.50 a share, on revenue of
$847 million for the three months ending Sept. 30. In the same
period last year, net income was $87 million, or $1.27 a share, on
revenue of $835 million.
   Since the first quarter of the year, Conrail has spent $1.3
billion to cut the number of outstanding shares by 40.3 percent
since the end of last year's third quarter.
   ``As solid as the third quarter has been, the troublesome
economic outlook for the remainder of the year and 1991 concerns
us,'' Conrail Chairman James Hagan said.
   He predicted a continued lowering of the traffic mix, a higher
volume of low-revenue freight and a lower volume of high-revenue
freight.
   For the first nine months of the year, Conrail's profits were
$171 million, or $3.23 a share, on revenue of $2.531 billion. For
the same period in 1989, profit was $229 million, or $3.34 a share,
or $2.588 billion

<HEAD>AT&amp;T And Japanese To Build Transpacific Cable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and
Kokusai Denshin Denwa of Japan on Wednesday announced they are
studying the possibility of building a new telephone cable across
the Pacific Ocean.
   The proposed cable system, which would link the United States
and Japan, would use optical amplifier technology and operate at
eight times the capacity of existing fiber-optic cables, AT&amp;T said
in a statement.
   The new cable network system would help international carriers
provide telecommunications services in their countries, said David
Bikle, a spokesman for AT&amp;T.
   Optical amplifiers, which are segments of an optical fiber that
contain the element erbium, boost lightwave signals without
converting them to electrons and back to light, as is done in
conventional systems.
   The world's first fiber optic transoceanic system went into
service in 1988 and is capable of handling 40,000 calls at once,
Bikle said.
   The new optical amplifier cable system, expected to be in
service in 1996, would be able to handle 600,000 calls, he said.

   Inland Steel Industries Inc. reported Wednesday
that it lost $2.2 million during the third quarter, largely because
of lower sales and expected start-up costs for its venture with
Nippon Steel Corp.
   The loss, which translates to 27 cents a share, compares with a
profit of $18.3 million, or 43 cents a share, during the third
period last year. Sales declined from $981 million to $960 million.
   The company said its I-N Tek venture, a sheet-finishing mill,
with Nippon cost the company about 40 cents a share during the
quarter.
   ``Clearly, we are very disappointed with these results,'' said
Frank W. Luerssen, chairman and chief executive officer. ``Despite
a relatively strong steel market, we failed to achieve our volume
and mix expectations for the quarter.''
   He said the losses are expected to carry over to the final
quarter and blamed continuing initial costs associated with I-N
Tek, a strike at its largest iron ore mine and a fire at its No. 4
basic oxygen furnace shop.
   For the first three quarters, Inland reported a net income of
$36.5 million, or 55 cents a share, compared with $113 million, or
$3.04 a share during the first nine months of 1989. Sales declined
by 7 percent, from $3.19 billion to $2.96 billion.

thousands of telephone lines often go dead because the antiquated
system doesn't have waterproof cables. When phones aren't working,
it could take weeks - even months - before service is restored.
``It's incomprehensible,'' says an executive with
