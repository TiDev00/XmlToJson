   A huge plastic recycling center will open
this fall to reuse all the cheeseburger holders, foam coffee cups
and other fast-food detritus from restaurants, hospitals and
schools, officials said Friday.
   ``This a positive step for the environment and for Southern
California,'' said E. James Schneiders, president and chief
executive officer of the National Polystyrene Recycling Co. ``We
know people here want to recycle polystyrene and we are making that
possible.''
   The company will own the 55,000-square-foot plant currently
under construction in Corona, a western suburb, and TALCO Recycling
Inc. will operate it, said Schneiders. It will open in October.
   The company also is planning to open centers in the San
Francisco, Chicago and Philadelphia metropolitan areas by the end
of this year, Schneiders said.
   Schneiders and TALCO president and owner John Shedd announced
the new center at Wadsworth Elementary School, where students
participate in a program to recycle lunch trays made of polystyrene.
   Students from 17 Los Angeles Unified School District campuses
have recycled more than 1.5 million foam lunch trays.
   National Polystyrene opened the first polystyrene recycling
center in the United States. Plastics Again, the plant in
Leominster, Mass., can recycle up to 3 million pounds of used
polystyrene annually.
   The Corona plant will be able to recycle more than 13 million
pounds of drink cups, plates and eating utensils, along with
non-food packing products such as packaging foam and foam
containers.
   The plant will pay four cents a pound for polystyrene materials.
Although individuals can drop off their used molded plastic, center
officials expect most clients will be companies and institutions,
such as hospitals, schools and fast-food restaurants.
   At the plant, the materials will be washed, ground, rinsed and
then melted down. The material will then be formed into long
spaghetti-like strips, run through a cold water bath and chopped
into little pellets.
   The pellets can be resold to companies that make polystyrene
products.
   ``Polystyrene had been recycled for years before recycling
became a public issue,'' Schneiders said. ``What is new now is the
post-consumer recycling of polystyrene.
   ``Maybe eventually curbside pickup programs will include
polystyrene, along with aluminum cans, newspapers and glass
bottles,'' he said. ``We sure would like that.''

   The Navy will continue underwater explosive tests
off Key West, a military official said Friday, despite a
confrontation with two dolphin lovers that led to a $10 million
lawsuit and a federal investigation.
   Several more tests are planned, but times and locations are
secret, said Joe Cody, a spokesman for the Naval Air Development
Center, a wing of the Navy that develops aircraft systems and other
military components.
   Some environmentalists claim the tests harm dolphins and
threaten fragile coral reefs.
   On Thursday, two animal rights activists who claim they were
rammed by boats during a protest last week filed a $10 million suit
against private companies hired by the Navy to carry personnel and
equipment for the tests.
   The Dade Circuit Court suit by Russel Rector and Richard O'Barry
claims they were struck by vessels from Miami-based Moby Marine
Corp. and General Offshore Corp. of Key West. The two companies are
charged with assault, intentional infliction of bodily harm and
negligence.
   Officials at both companies said Friday they had not seen the
suit and could not comment. They were hired to take part in the
tests by the Navy.
   Cody, speaking from the development center's headquarters in
Warminster, Pa., said an attorney has been assigned to the case. He
had no further comment.
   The FBI said it was also looking into the allegations from
Rector and O'Barry, who trained a dolphin that appeared on the
1960s television show ``Flipper.''
   Hospital records indicate the men suffered bruises and sprains.
O'Barry had a concussion.
   They had swum into the test area to try to block the test of the
1,200-pound explosive, which in fact already had been detonated.
   O'Barry halted an earlier test by hanging onto a buoy in the
off-limits zone.

   The voice of the Baghdad Radio announcer
boomed onto the airwaves in fractured English, addressing U.S.
soldiers: ``Do you want to go back home from the Arabian desert ...
psychologically broken?''
   Iraq's new English-language program, broadcast on shortwave
radio, stepped up the anti-American rhetoric its Arabic media
services have waged for weeks.
   Taking a cue from broadcasters such as Tokyo Rose and Axis Sally
during World War II and Hanoi Hannah in the Vietnam war, the
programs featured an eclectic mix of news, music and mockery meant
to demoralize soldiers rushed in to Saudi Arabia since the Aug. 2
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   During the hourlong program, the broadcaster asked, ``Remember
what the petrol emirs are doing to American girls. Do you want to
defend them?''
   In addition to alleging immoral gulf emirs had ``enjoyed'' the
company of U.S. women, the broadcast mentioned faraway loved ones,
desert heat, quicksand, rising taxes in the United States, war
injuries and U.S. soldiers missing in action in Vietnam.
   The brief messages were interspersed with music.
   About 30 seconds of Big Band swing tunes that Tokyo Rose herself
might have used was followed by:
   ``To the American soldier in the Saudi Arabia desert: Would you
like to be one of the cripples who are only lamented in the charity
ceremonies? Do you want to go back home from the Arabian desert and
you are psychologically broken?''
   Then would come some taped middle-of-the-road music that seemed
more appropriate in elevators or a few bars from one of Lebanon's
Westernized composers.
   There were also ``special reports.'' One listed pro-Iraqi
demonstrations ``disrupting world capitals,'' another was a tirade
against Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates for trying to destroy
the Iraqi economy this year by overproducing oil and driving down
prices.
   A third analyzed the objective of the United States in sending
up to 250,000 troops to Saudi Arabia, claiming the main purpose was
occupation. The Bush administration has said the troops were there
for defensive purposes.
   Talk radio it wasn't. The format was heavy with long sentences
and standard phrases that are the hallmarks of anti-American
rhetoric in the Arab region.
   Lines such as ``imposing American Zionist schemes on the Arab
nation'' were unlikely to win the hearts and minds of many U.S.
enlisted men.
   It could not be immediately confirmed that the programs were
monitored by the troops in Saudi Arabia.
   The male broadcastor, speaking in British-accented English, made
most of his appeals in the form of questions:
   ``To the American soldier in the Saudi Arabia desert: How do you
fight against Iraq and you know that there are more than 200
churches in it? Do you want to kill a Christian like you and to be
killed by him. Will you be pleased to be ended like this?''
   With the U.S. buildup the largest since the United States pulled
out of Vietnam in 1975, that war was an inevitable topic:
   ``To the American soldier in the Saudi Arabia desert: Ask your
friends about what had happened in Vietnam. The American soldiers'
corpses are still lost in Vietnam after they had been eaten by
worms.''
   And the harsh conditions were also stressed. ``Why do you come
to the burning desert?'' the broadcaster asked. Another time he
said, ``Didn't you hear the sand dunes in the Saudi Arabian desert
are moving and they swallowed many people and they will swallow
you?''
   It added, ``Also guys, the Islamic Organization in Colorado has
condemned the invasion.''
   Mentioning home states was a favorite of similar broadcasts
during World War II and the Korean War.
   Back then, many of the U.S. troops did not get broadcast news
from home for days.
   Sexy female voices and the playing of American Top 20 records
were meant to get the troops grumbling about the war and missing
home.
   Germany used Axis Sally to say things like ``Hello gang, throw
down those little old guns and toddle off home. There's no getting
the Germans down.''
   Lord Haw-Haw, a British-American citizen, was another
broadcaster who made similar statements beamed toward London. He
was executed for treason while Japan's Tokyo Rose and Axis Sally
received prison terms of 10 to 12 years.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A symbolic Arab force being created to help
protect Saudi Arabia from its hostile neighbor Iraq pales beside
the massive fighting machine the United States is sending.
   The contributions of Egypt, Syria and Morocco will be relatively
small at best, and it is hard to pin down just what those countries
are sending.
   The main significance of the force appears to be that it enables
the Saudis to justify the American presence by telling Arabs leery
of foreigners that brother Arabs have also come to their rescue.
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, architect of the Arab League
resolution that brought about the Arab commitment, says Syria and
Morocco will join Egypt in sending troops. Moslem but non-Arab
Pakistan and Bangladesh say they will also send troops.
   The force will be a few thousand at most, insignificant as a
military threat to 160,000 Iraqis massed with tanks on the Saudi
border.
   ``We are sending not more than 2,000 soldiers to help the
Saudis, under the command of the Saudi Arabian armed forces,''
Mubarak told reporters at Alexandria. ``I don't compare our forces
with the U.S. forces.''
   The Pentagon on Washington has said the United States force
might eventually reach 250,000 if necessary.
   Little has been said officially about the Moroccan and Syrian
forces, which sources in the Persian Gulf area have said would
total about 5,000 men each.
   Official sources in Rabat said Morocco has dispatched 1,200
soldiers so far.
   Syrian officials have said nothing about the their force. Saudi
diplomats reported earlier in the week that Syrian soldiers had
arrived, but Col. Andrew Duncan of the London-based International
Institute of Strategic Studies said he understands they amount to
nothing more than a planeload of staff officers.
   Duncan added that the Arab force appears to include the wrong
kind of soldier needed to face Saddam Hussein's strike forces.
   ``The sort of forces coming in really aren't the best things to
use in armored warfare in the desert,'' Duncan said by telephone.
``Once elite paratroopers make their marvelous parachute drop, they
don't have much more they can do'' against tanks.
   Egyptian Defense Ministry sources have said Egypt is sending
commandos, paratroops, chemical-warfare specialists and infantrymen.
   The Defense Ministry has not said how many soldiers are going.
In a statement Friday, its first on the deployment, the ministry
said: ``Elements of the Egyptian armed forces left the homeland . .
. (and) have arrived in the areas of operation assigned to them in
Saudi Arabia.''
   On Aug. 10, Mubarak pushed through an Arab League summit
conference the resolution establishing the joint force. The idea
purportedly was to help Saudi Arabia defend itself if Iraq invades
via Kuwait, which it seized on Aug. 2.
   The resolution also gave Arab approval to the Saudis' request
for U.S. help for Saudi Arabia's U.S.-armed 123,000-man military.
   Complaints from Arabs began as soon as the invitation was
announced. Feelings on the subject run so high that Mubarak's
resolution passed at the Arab summit by a bare majority. Twelve of
the 20 leaders attending voting ``yes.''
   Six of the 12, including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait's ousted
government, were gulf states concerned about Iraqi expansion.
   Military analyst Duncan said even a 15,000-man Arab force would
be ``still token, especially if you're only talking about men. They
would need something to fight with other than rifles and machine
guns.''

<TEXT>
   Both American troops and their Saudi allies
are experiencing some culture shock these days.
   The most obvious surprise for the Saudi forces has been the
presence of women in the U.S. military, particularly the Air Force.
   A group of Saudi airmen stood in stunned silence the other day
as an American woman working a supply line in the triple-digit heat
took off her uniform shirt to work in her T-shirt. She was asked to
put her full uniform back on.
   An Air Force captain assigned to an AWACS plane said she often
finds Saudi airmen assigned to the crews staring at her.
   ``They seem shocked at first, but they're extremely polite and I
think they're getting used to it,'' the North Carolina native said.
``It must be a strange sight for them.''
   Meanwhile, U.S. forces are in a country where alcohol is
illegal, shorts are considered offensive and virtually all activity
grinds to a halt five times a day for prayers. Even Saudi soldiers,
some of whom are working side by side with Americans, stop for
prayers.
   For now, as they are briefed on Saudi and Muslim customs and try
to get accustomed to the searing heat, Americans troops are not
being allowed to make recreation trips into Saudi cities, although
some are housed temporarily at local hotels.
   The Saudis have been extraordinarily gracious hosts, even as
they are occasionally taken aback by the ways of their allies. But
both Saudi and American officials say there likely will be at least
a few incidents if the U.S. military presence here is a prolonged
one.
   ``When you have two cultures that are so different, so
fundamentally different, there are bound to be some conflicts,'' a
Saudi government minister said this week. ``But we are confident
that we can keep them to a minimum.''
   The culture clash comes at an already stressful period of Saudi
history. The oil boom took Arabia out of obscurity and the past two
decades have brought an incredible development boom in major oil
and urban areas. The Saudis are reaching out to the West for help
in development and business, while at the same time fighting to
maintain their strict, religious traditions.
   To help keep the balance, the Saudis have tight restrictions on
foreigners; only those with work contracts are allowed into the
country and almost all of them live in wall-ringed compounds.
   Suddenly, thousands more Americans are on Saudi soil, most of
them young and unfamiliar with Arab and Saudi traditions.
   The U.S. military is taking a number of steps designed to keep
Saudi-American interaction, military actions excepted, to a
minimum. Troops interviewed this week seem to understand, although
they're not always happy about it.
   ``The guys sure would like a cold one,'' an Air Force captain
said Thursday from the sun-drenched tarmac of a Saudi air base.
   ``Tell the folks back home to send in the Budweiser plane,'' an
Army tank gunner said earlier in the week.
   Some of the misunderstandings are innocent, but, to the Saudis,
offensive. Several Saudi military officials were sitting with U.S.
troops early in the week when the Americans served field rations
for lunch. Two pork dishes were among the choices offered; Muslims
do not eat pork.
   The greatest cultural adjustment revolves around the presence of
hundreds of U.S. military women here for Operation Desert Shield.
   While the co-ed U.S. military forces banter about, Saudi men and
women rarely interact in public beyond quiet conversation. Most
Saudi women wear ankle-length black robes, covering their heads and
usually their faces with black headdresses and veils.
   Saudis consider it offensive for women to wear pants,
particularly shorts or blue jeans, and Saudi women will hiss at
women they consider dressed inappropriately. The women in the U.S.
military contingent have been advised to wear the robes _ abayas _
when they venture out in public.
   ``I think it would be too risky to go downtown without it,'' a
21-year-old female Air Force senior airman from Mount Clemens,
Mich., said Thursday. ``I'm not going to take any chances.''
   It's unclear when the U.S. forces will be able to wander about
in Saudi cities. Officers from each of the services said this week
some recreational activities will have to be planned if the stay
here drags on much longer, and there is every indication that it
will.
   ``We are guests of the Saudis and we need to be aware of their
cultural concerns,'' said Air Force Col. John McBroom. ``We'll
brief them (American troops) and tell them what to do and not to do
and if they don't do it right we'll send them home. It's that
simple.''
   Americans have been on Saudi soil since the 1930s, when an
expedition drilling for water struck oil, triggering Arabia's
interaction with the Western world.
   ``I think we Saudis always, because of the oil find, have
associated Americans with our good fortune,'' a Saudi government
official said over lunch this week. ``We are very different, but we
have a positive bond.''

<HEAD>Military Operation to Liberate Kuwait Impossible Now, Analysts Say</HEAD>

   With seven Iraqi divisions in Kuwait and another
24 near the Iraq-Saudi border, European and Israeli military
analysts say a U.S.-led military operation to liberate Kuwait would
be outnumbered and outgunned.
   The best option for the moment, the experts say, is to go on
barricading the ports of Iraq and its friends.
   They say the forces now assembling in Saudi Arabia should dig
in, trust their superior weapons to deter further Iraqi aggression,
and wait for Iraq to make the first move.
   ``But the problem is tension is growing because Iraq is now able
to move more forces across the border,'' said Paul Beaver,
publisher of Jane's Defense Weekly.
   ``The risk of escalation is there because there are going to be
so many forces in Saudi, most of whom can't talk to the other _
usually a recipe for disaster,'' he said in an interview Thursday.
   According to Jane's latest estimates, Iraq has seven divisions
in Kuwait and 24 on the Iraqi-Saudi border. ``We're talking of them
having available now south of Baghdad 400,000 soldiers,'' Beaver
said.
   With a flight landing in Saudi Arabia every seven minutes, the
U.S. military force is approaching 50,000, Jane's estimates.
   But Col. Andrew Duncan of the International Institute of
Strategic Studies estimated it would take a six-month buildup of
U.S. forces to be strong enough to oust the Iraqis from Kuwait.
   He said the Americans currently have only a few old, light
Sheridan tanks in Saudi Arabia and would need heavy armor for any
serious push.
   ``I would say it's pie in the sky to say there's any military
option to invade Kuwait,'' Duncan said. The United States would
have less than one mechanized division there by September, and
would need at least five to push the Iraqis out and keep them out,
he said.
   Francis Tusa, European editor of Armed Forces Journal
International, said another question was whether the Saudis would
allow 250,000 or 300,000 U.S. troops on their soil, given the
opposition of many Arabs to the American presence in the Middle
East.
   ``I would hang back. I would let the Iraqis make the first move,
and let them make a serious move,'' he said. ``The Iraqis,
politically speaking, have to do something pretty flagrant and
massive before the Arabs will be happy with a U.S. response.''
   Dore Gold, a senior analyst at Tel Aviv University's Jaffee
Center for Strategic Studies, said the main American option would
be ``a massive air attack on the Iraqi military infrastructure.''
   ``But most do not believe that you can use the air force to
force ground troops to retreat,'' he said.
   Beaver said many military strategists believe air attacks
against economic targets like power stations and desalination
plants would work.
   But the ramifications are at present ``far too fraught for the
Americans to contemplate,'' he said.
   Ian Anthony, a researcher at the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute, said the U.S. Air Force could also hit
strategic targets like highways that channel supplies from Jordan
to Iraq.
   But neither side is eager to escalate the conflict, he said,
because ``for either side now, the next step is likely to have
extremely serious consequences.''
   Dore said another reason for holding off on action now is that
both sides believe time is on their side.
   ``The U.S. believes that the sanctions against Iraq will be felt
in several months, while Iraq feels that the larger mercantile
international system will start to cheat in a few months' time and
the enthusiastic Arab national support for (Saddam Hussein) will
eventually undermine economic sanctions,'' he said.
   The one thing the multinational force can do is effectively
blockade ports, Beaver said.
   ``That means Mersin in southern Turkey, Aqaba in Jordan, and of
course the neck of the gulf or the Straits of Hormuz to prevent
Iraqi traffic going in and out,'' he said.
   But Beaver added that Iraq's sudden decision to settle the
eight-year war with Iran could rupture the stranglehold if Tehran
opens its border with Iraq.

<TEXT>
   The spirit of Albert Schweitzer has
found an unlikely home on a quiet street in Connecticut, thousands
of miles from the African village where the late theologian,
philosopher and doctor spent much of his life as a medical
missionary.
   Inside the Albert Schweitzer Memorial Foundation, large black
and white portraits of the Nobel Peace Prize-winner stare down from
the walls, interspersed with printed quotations from his work.
   Relics of his life crowd the first-floor rooms of the small
house, including busts of Schweitzer, with his craggy, mustachioed
face, and a book the great humanitarian inscribed to Maria
Lagendijk, the Dutch nurse who worked with him at his hospital in
Lambarene, a small village in the West African country of Gabon.
   ``You know how as young people you always find a hero, a star
you can cling to? That's exactly how it was for me,'' said Harold
Robles, the foundation's director, recalling the time when he
learned of Schweitzer as a boy in a classroom in Rotterdam, Holland.
   Robles, an international telemarketing executive who moved to
the United States in 1981, turned his lifelong fascination with
Schweitzer into a public monument when he established the
foundation in 1983.
   His collection today is used by Schweitzer scholars from around
the world.
   But Robles said his greatest contribution to Schweitzer's memory
will occur in New York Thursday with the start of the two-day
International Albert Schweitzer Colloquium at the United Nations.
Robles spent 2{ years organizing the colloquium, timed for the 25th
anniversary of Schweitzer's death on Sept. 4, 1965, at the age of
90.
   Such renowned figures as Noble Peace Prize winners Oscar Arias
Sanchez, Elie Wiesel and Linus Pauling will speak on ``The
Relevance of Albert Schweitzer at the Dawn of the 21st Century.''
   Rhena Schweitzer Miller, Schweitzer's daughter, is serving as an
honorary chairwoman.
   She said the gathering, which already has attracted nearly 700
people, will help people see the continuing relevance of her
father's philosophy.
   ``He talked about many things before his time,'' she said,
reciting his interest in such contemporary issues as the
environment and nuclear war.
   Because of the West African hospital he designed and built in
1913, Schweitzer is known to most people as a famous doctor, Robles
said. He spent most of his life in the remote village, establishing
a leper colony and a large general practice.
   But Schweitzer had numerous other accomplishments that are less
widely known. His book ``The Quest of the Historical Jesus''
influenced a generation of theologians. A gifted musician,
Schweitzer wrote a groundbreaking biography of Johann Sebastian
Bach in 1905 and published Bach's complete organ works, because he
also was an organist.
   But in his own mind, Schweitzer seems to have thought of himself
first and foremost as a philosopher, said Robles.
   In a quotation Robles is particularly fond of, Schweitzer said:
``When you portray me, it should not be as the doctor who ministers
to the sick. It is my philosophy of Reverence for Life that I
consider my primary contribution to the world.''
   Robles' first wrote to his hero when he was 8. Schweitzer wrote
back, telling him to study hard and finish his schoolwork before
making any great plans to come to Africa.
   Robles continued to write to the hospital, beginning what was to
be a lifelong correspondence with Lagendijk, the nurse who was
working with Schweitzer in Africa. The woman would write on
Schweitzer's behalf and pass on requests from the young boy.
   When Schweitzer visited Rotterdam when Robles was 11, Lagendijk
made sure the boy was on the list of those to meet him.
   Robles said people always are amazed by the fact that he
remembers little of this one face-to-face encounter he had with his
hero.
   ``The way I met Schweitzer and the way I admire him and came to
know him is through his books,'' Robles said. ``I read him over and
over and over again, and that is how I met the man.''

he can always go back to San Francisco and sit on the dock of the
bay.
   Especially if he's a sea lion.
   Last year, hundreds of squatters with fish breath descended on a
dock near the city's famed Fisherman's Wharf tourist attraction and
made themselves at home. Now many are back.
   The 100 or so sea lions on Pier 39 are just ``a bunch of really
lonely guys,'' said Ann Maurer of the California Marine Mammal
Center in Marin County. They are ``young males that couldn't
establish themselves with females during the mating season in the
channel islands off Santa Barbara,'' she said.
   Except for a lack of sea lionesses, the pier ``is everything a
sea lion could ask for,'' Maurer said. ``As far as the sea lions
are concerned, K dock is just another strip of beach with plenty of
sun and a lot of fish just over the side.''
   Their choice of residence brings them in close contact with
humans, many who have never seen the lumbering ocean mammals
outside a zoo.
   The barking, sometimes pushy sea lions are protected under the
federal Marine Mammals Protective Act and may not be harassed,
hunted, captured or killed.
   About 300 of the animals that can weigh up to 800 pounds took up
residence on Pier 39 last year, with most departing by spring. They
began returning last weekend, Peigin Barrett, executive director of
the marine center, said Friday. ``They come and go with the fishing
and breeding seasons,'' she said. ``What's unusual is to see them
in one place and so close to humans. They are only about eight feet
away with just a railing separating them from people.''
   Business owners for Pier 39, which contains tourist shops and
amusement arcades, called the marine center for help when sea lions
started congregating at the dock last year. ``Neighbors complained
about all the noise from the animals,'' Barrett said.
   Ultimately, the sea lions were simply left alone. The pugnacious
critters are not intimidated by the boat people who normally
inhabit the 20 or so berths on the dock. The harbor's managers
moved the boats for the duration of their seasonal visit.
   ``We give them that dock when they show up, move out boats to
other docks,'' said Pier 39 spokeswoman Alicia Vargas. ``It's live
and let live, and as long as we've got the space to spare, they're
welcome to it. Besides, they're kind of cute and the tourists like
them.''
   Barrett said the sea lion invasion can teach people more about
sea life.
   ``People get a close look at the sea lions. It is very
educational,'' she said. ``There were several sea lions that had
fishing debris around their necks and the public could see the
damage caused by carelessness.''
   The current complement is likely to stay until springtime, then
try their luck again next year in mating competition on the islands.
   ``Get used to it,'' Barrett said. ``As far as the sea lions are
concerned, Pier 39 is home.''

   Actor Nicolas Cage admits he has bizarre
tastes in film roles, almost as off-beat as those of producer David
Lynch, with whom he worked on the new deep blue comedy ``Wild at
Heart.''
   ``I've followed his movies ever since I saw `Eraserhead,' and
I've seen all of them,'' Cage said. ``I was a big fan of Lynch, so,
when I started working with him, I was a little bit nervous.''
   Like his 1986 film ``Blue Velvet,'' Lynch's gory, spaced-out
creation ``Wild at Heart'' is anything but mainstream. In it, Cage
plays Sailor Ripley, an ex-con with a snakeskin jacket, a habit of
aping Elvis Presley, and a chain-smoking sexpot for a girlfriend.
   The 25-year-old Cage said he doesn't feel out of place.
   ``My taste is sort of left field,'' Cage said. ``It's not that
I'm trying to be underground, it's just that's what I like.''
   A nephew of Francis Ford Coppola, Cage played a 1930s gangster
in ``The Cotton Club,'' Kathleen Turner's boyfriend in ``Peggy Sue
Got Married,'' and a bungling thief in ``Raising Arizona.''

   Paul Newman is seeking to recover
$40,000 loaned to a former executive of the Hole in the Wall Camp,
which the actor founded in 1987 for children with catastrophic
illnesses.
   A lawsuit filed in Bridgeport Superior Court on Thursday alleged
that Jeffrey Glick, the camp's executive director from 1987 to
1989, borrowed the money from the camp in Ashford and later left
the state without paying it back.
   ``There's no scandal; we just want to get our money back,'' said
Newman's lawyer, Leo Nevas.
   He said Glick was fired after it became apparent he was not
going to repay the money. Glick was hired on the condition that he
live near the camp, and was loaned $40,000 to buy a house in nearby
Brooklyn, the lawsuit said. Meanwhile, Glick and his wife put up
for sale their house in Kerhonkson, N.Y.
   The lawsuit said Glick told camp directors several times in late
1988 and 1989 he had difficulty selling the house, but assured them
the loan would be repaid.
   On June 6, lawyers for Newman discovered the Glicks had sold
their home in June 1989 for $127,500. Nevas said he believes the
couple, who failed to appear at an earlier hearing on the lawsuit,
now live in Buffalo, N.Y.

   Charles Grodin advises would-be actors not to
take it personally when they're rejected for roles.
   ``When you realize that there may be 1,000 people who look and
sound very much like you, it's very hard. So many of the better
people get lost because of the sheer numbers,'' said Grodin, who
co-stars with Jim Belushi in the new comedy film ``Taking Care of
Business.''
   ``You can't take it too personally,'' Grodin said Friday.
   His philosophy is spelled out in his book, ``It Would Be So Nice
If You Weren't Here,'' published last year and out in paperback
next month.
   Aspiring actors, he said, should ``think not so much about
getting ahead as becoming as good as you can be, so you're ready
when you do get an opportunity,'' Grodin said. ``I did that, so I
didn't suffer from the frustration of all the rejections. They just
gave me more time.''
   Grodin, 55, made his film debut as Mia Farrow's doctor in
``Rosemary's Baby.'' He has since appeared as the navigator in
``Catch 22'' and an overly ambitious hero in ``The Heartbreak Kid.''

   The Energy Department's delay in announcing
its revised cost of the superconducting super collider amid reports
of a $3 billion jump confirms that the atom-smasher project ``is
way out of control,'' a congressional critic charges.
   The announcement had been expected Friday, but the Energy
Department said the four groups making the estimates are still
working out differences. The revised figure would be ready by Sept.
7, the department said.
   In a letter to Rep. Robert Roe, D-N.J., chairman of the House
Science, Space and Technology Committee, Deputy Energy Secretary
Henson Moore said the ``reconciliation process is still under
way.'' He gave no more explanation.
   On July 25, Moore said the four groups would try to have a final
figure Aug. 17.
   Preliminary estimates of three of the groups were around $8
billion. A fourth estimate prepared by a group under DOE contract
but acting independently is between $11.5 billion and $11.7
billion, the newsletter Inside Energy reported. The department has
not confirmed the estimate.
   Usually, only three groups of estimators work on DOE projects.
   The previous highest figure, $8.6 billion, was made last month
by the group of scientists that redesigned the collider. For a
nearly a year, DOE planners have said it would cost about $8
billion. When first proposed in the mid-1980s, the collider was
estimated to cost $4.4 billion.
   ``Delaying reports and rising costs confirm the suspicion this
project is way out of control and very likely to run into serious
budgetary questions,'' said Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, a leading
opponent of the new machine.
   ``I grow more confident each day the collider won't survive,''
he said.
   The spiraling cost has been one of the main arguments Eckart and
other congressional opponents have used against the atom smasher,
to be built south of Dallas.
   Congress has appropriated $318 million, including funds to start
construction, for next year. But that could be jeopardized because
of the higher estimate, Eckart said.
   ``Given the ineptitude in giving us accurate cost estimates and
facing a real budget summit ... that will make major cuts across
the board, the SSC may have just priced itself out of existence,''
he said.
   With the $8 billion figure in mind, the House in May capped the
collider's federal funds at $5 billion for the next five years.
Texas has pledged $1 billion. The rest is expected to come from
foreign investors and other sources.
   The three preliminary estimates agreed on the costs of building
the 54-mile tunnel and the superconducting magnets. They varied in
the cost of potential delays.
   The independent group says the collider alone will cost $9.7
billion, and that detectors _ the giant microscopes that record
atomic collisions _ will cost another $2 billion, Inside Energy
reported. Moore told the newsletter the group may have thought more
detectors are needed.
   But members of the Texas delegation said the collider's funding
would remain intact through the budget summit. Sens. Lloyd Bentsen,
a Democrat, and Phil Gramm, a Republican, are among the budget
negotiators.
   ``I don't even believe that's in question,'' said Rep. Steve
Bartlett, R-Dallas.
   ``I have every confidence the SSC will be built on time and
within budget. I've heard nothing that makes me doubt the budget
we've already got for it.''

   At least four states may have lost population
since 1980, according to preliminary Census figures.
   Louisiana, Michigan, North Dakota and West Virginia registered
population declines, data released Friday showed.
   The Census Bureau said 14 other states reported increases.
   Reports for the 18 states were sent to state and local officials
as part of the Census Bureau's local review program.
   Census officials emphasized that the figures are preliminary and
were provided to allow local governments to question the results in
the event people were missed or overcounted.
   Final official state population figures are scheduled to be
issued Dec. 31.
   Here is a list of the figures made public Friday, compared with
the results of the 1980 census. Reports for other states are
expected to become public over the next few weeks.
   Connecticut: 3,226,929, up from 3,108,000.

<HEAD>Gun Control Advocates Cheered by 1976 Souter Brief</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 1976 legal brief signed by Supreme Court
nominee David H. Souter argues against an unlimited constitutional
right of individuals to possess firearms, says a group seeking
stricter regulation of handguns.
   ``The Second Amendment does not create any right in U.S.
citizens to possess any and all weapons regardless of state
regulation, but rather concerns only authority of the states to
keep and raise militias,'' said the brief, released Friday by the
Washington-based Center to Prevent Handgun Violence.
   The brief defended New Hampshire's concealed-weapons law.
   ``Souter's brief directly contradicts the National Rifle
Association's position ... that the (Constitution's) Second
Amendment guarantees individuals an absolute right to own and
possess guns of all types,'' said Barbara Lautman, executive
director of the Center.
   An NRA spokeswoman said the organization could not respond
before seeing the brief.
   Souter was New Hampshire's attorney general when the brief was
filed in the state Supreme Court. It was signed by both Souter and
attorney Richard B. McNamara, and whether Souter actually wrote the
brief could not be determined immediately.
   The brief urged the state court to reject the appeal of a man,
Stephen Sanne, who had been convicted of carrying two loaded guns
without a permit. Sanne argued that the conviction violated his
constitutional rights.
   The nation's highest court, which has not issued a ruling on the
issue in decades, never has decided specifically just what the
Second Amendment protects.
   The amendment says, ``A well regulated militia, being necessary
to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep
and bear arms, shall not be infringed.''

<HEAD>Teamsters Win Round With USAir</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   USAir must let 8,000 employees vote again on
whether to be represented by the Teamsters union, because the first
organizing drive was tainted by illegal anti-union activities, a
federal labor board says.
   The Teamsters had lost their bid to represent workers in a
ballot count announced in January. But the National Mediation Board
ruled Friday that actions by the airline interfered with the
union's organizing campaign.
   The union may request a rerun election within 30 days.
   The Teamsters, who were trying to win the right to represent
8,000 workers who load airplanes at 180 airports around the
country, had charged that USAir unfairly interfered with their
organizing drive.
   The union said USAir managers called meetings with small groups
of workers to discuss the union's campaign, put up anti-Teamsters
posters urging workers to burn their ballots and produced two
anti-Teamsters videotapes.
   ``The carrier, through the totality of its conduct, has tainted
the laboratory conditions for a fair election,'' the ruling said.
``Remedial action must be taken.''
   The board, created in 1934, mediates disputes involving
railroads and airlines.
   ``We're extremely disappointed,'' said David Shipley, a USAir
spokesman. ``As far as we're concerned, we ran a perfectly legal
election campaign.''
   A Teamsters union official said no one was immediately available
to comment on the ruling.
   Another election means an all-or-nothing event for the
Teamsters, who already represent some 1,800 USAir workers in
Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Buffalo and Boston. If the union loses
again, those workers would no longer be Teamsters members.
   The Teamsters had represented cargo workers at USAir before its
1989 merger with Piedmont airlines, whose employees were not
members of the union.
   Last December, the Mediation Board ordered the election to
determine whether workers at USAir and former Piedmont employees
would be represented by the Teamsters. Three other unions
representing pilots, flight attendants and mechanics at USAir
gained the right to represent the Piedmont workers without
elections.
   There were 8,002 workers eligible to vote, and under the board's
rules, the Teamsters needed at least half of those workers to mail
in ballots in the union's favor. Only 2,371 workers mailed their
ballots in favor of the Teamsters, with most of the workers not
bothering to vote.
   USAir is based in Arlington, Va.

military post offices to handle mail to the Middle East.
   Twenty-four new Army Post Offices will handle mail for Army and

handle Navy and Marine Corps mail, the Postal Service said Friday.
   Only first class mail, cards and letters may be sent to the
Middle East. Each item must be under 12 ounces and is subject to
customs requirements.
   Under the military mail system, items addressed to the APO
numbers are brought by the postal service to Chicago, Washington or
New York where they are sorted and dispatched to Saudi Arabia. FPO
mail is going via New York or San Francisco.
   On arrival the distribution is completed by military personnel.
   Postal officials said mail should take between eight and 10 days
to travel between the United States and the troops in the Middle
East.
   Military personnel will be providing their new APO and FPO
numbers to friends and family, but mail sent to old numbers will
also be forwarded.

<HEAD>Florida State Picked Over MIT for New Magnetic Research Lab</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida State University will become the
national center of high-magnetic field research after edging out
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in a competition for
federal funds.
   The selection Friday of FSU by the National Science Foundation
will make the Tallahassee-based institution eligible for a grant of
up to $60 million over five years.
   Depending on the availability of federal funds, FSU could
receive up to $18 million in the next 12 months to build a
laboratory with powerful magnets creating unprecedented magnetic
field strengths. Physicist Jack E. Crow will direct the science at
the laboratory, which is expected to be in operation within three
years.
   Research related to production and use of magnetic fields can
lead to new devices for the computer industry, new materials with
exceptional strengths and major advances in medicine. Europe and
Japan have made strides in such research while U.S. capabilities
have lagged.
   David A. Sanchez, an assistant director of the foundation, said
Florida State showed a greater commitment to creating ``a national
center of excellence'' even though MIT currently has a stronger
faculty.
   Sanchez said FSU has pledged to create slots for 54 people,
including tenured faculty, visiting faculty and visiting
researchers. By contrast, he said, MIT had no recruitment plan for
faculty which he said was critical ``since the major scientific
figures at MIT are near retirement.''
   Florida State and MIT were the finalists in a competition that
involved an unspecified number of universities. The facility will
be called the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.
   The state of Florida will commit $58 million for the facility in
Tallahassee over five years. FSU is joining with the University of
Florida and Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, a leader
in the area of pulsed magnetic technology.
   Qualified scientists and engineers from across the nation and
around the world will be able to make use of the laboratory, which
will have from eight to 10 magnets.
   MIT originally had proposed to build the lab for $68 million,
Sanchez said. It proposed to meet the $8 million reduction by
eliminating several magnet developments and reducing the faculty
support.
   FSU, he said, would have met the reduced funding by eliminating
several projects, extending the timetable for several of the
proposed magnets but not reducing faculty commitment.

   The ruling Friday paved the way for Almeyda to become Chile's

   Pinochet stripped Almeyda, 68, of all his civic rights for 10

struggle against his military regime. Almeyda consistently denied
the charges.
   Almeyda was foreign minister in the leftist government toppled

   The sign outside the fairground proclaims,
``We will not be caught between Iraq and a hard place.''
   It's the newest slogan of energy conservationists gathering this
weekend for the Midwest Renewable Energy Fair. They believe the
Middle East crisis should refocus attention on how much America
depends on fossil fuels _ after a decade of lagging interest.
   ``We are caught with our backs against the wall again. We don't
have a solar industry or a renewable industry to fall back on,''
said Bob Ramlow, a fair organizer and operator of a solar products
company in this central Wisconsin town.
   The fair is the largest of three planned nationwide this year to
encourage reduced dependence on finite fossil fuels and expanded
use of energy sources that are environmentally safe and renewable _
like the sun and wind.
   About 10,000 people were expected to attend the three-day fair,
which ends Sunday. Educational seminars and displays like
solar-powered microwave ovens and wind-powered stereo sound systems
dotted the fairgrounds.
   Some participants described themselves as 1960s-style
``back-to-the-earth refugees'' who remember the gasoline crisis of
the mid-1970s and ensuing goals to wean the United States from
heavy oil consumption.
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in the oil-rich Persian Gulf, which
caused gasoline prices to climb as much as 20 cents a gallon within
a week, serves as a reminder that the United States has failed to
achieve those goals, Ramlow said.
   He is one of several Amherst residents who moved to the town of
2,500 in the 1970s to escape cities and experiment with alternate
energy. His home is fully solar-powered.
   ``I have a color TV,'' he said. ``A VCR. I have clock radios,
tape decks, stereos, a Nintendo game for my kids. You name it. I
have it. You don't have to give up something to use less energy.
   ``A lot of people in this area use wood for heating,'' he added.
``A lot of people drive high-mileage cars. There is definitely a
good environmental attitude around here.''
   Innovation is the pride of the 40 or so exhibitors at the fair.
John Osborne of Plymouth, Mich., displayed a 12-volt computer
system that can be powered by alternate energy sources.
   ``I am trying to appeal to the people who are running an office
out of their homes with solar power,'' Osborne said. ``I want to
get high performance computers into the hands of these innovative
people. They are pioneers.''
   Osborne said the Middle East crisis demonstrates how he's doing
more than saving money by turning from fuel-burning power sources.
   ``I have got solar panels on my roof. Nobody holds me hostage
for my power,'' he said.
   Most organizers, exhibitors and fairgoers predicted the Iraqi
invasion, while forcing a U.S. military buildup, might bring
something positive if it awakens dormant energy concerns.
   ``All the politicians want to jump on the bandwagon. When that
happens, you can tell it's hot,'' said Mike Torzewski, treasurer of
the group of energy-conscious Amherst residents who organized the
fair.
   Ken Wirtz, a visitor from nearby Wisconsin Rapids, strolled by
some displays with perhaps more interest than he might have had
before gasoline prices soared.
   ``When it costs you $20 to fill up your gas tank, it makes you
think a little bit,'' he said.
   Richard Perez, editor of Home Power, a magazine published in
California that last year urged the return of renewable energy
fairs, said the time is right to expand use of solar and wind power.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ``makes us realize we are
incredibly dependent on foreign oil, which makes us not free at
all,'' Perez said. ``I have a saying, `No one has to die for solar
energy.'''

<HEAD>USDA Revises Food Price Hikes Upward for 1990, Partly Blames Oil
Crunch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer food prices are going up 5 percent to
7 percent this year, sharply more than had been predicted and
perhaps slightly because of the Mideast oil crunch, the Agriculture
Department says.
   The new forecast compared with the 3 percent to 5 percent price
hike the department has been predicting for 1990 since December.
   Double-digit price gains in the first half of this year for
fresh fruits, pork, eggs and dairy products, along with
``uncertainties about future energy prices,'' are mostly to blame
for the upward revision, said the department's Economic Research
Service.
   ``However, most of the year's price increases probably took
place in the first half,'' the agency said Friday. ``Gains in the
second half are expected to be more modest.''
   But the report added that this assumes most of the evolving oil
price shock will take until next year to spill over into the
grocery store.
   Retail food prices rose an average of 5.8 percent in 1989, the
sharpest year-to-year increase since 1981. Much of that gain was
fallout from the 1988 drought that hit much of the nation.
   One USDA official who spoke only on condition of anonymity said
that without the Mideast crisis and rising energy costs, the new
food price estimate for 1990 would have been in the range of 5
percent to 6 percent.
   Thus, the official said, an allowance of only one percentage
point was made at the upper end of the estimate to allow for higher
oil prices.
   Further, the source said, some department analysts had wanted to
hold the new 1990 food price increase to less than what was
decided. Most felt the oil pinch is not going to hit this year, the
source said.

<HEAD>Commerce Department: Taiwan Dumping Cheap Sweaters in U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sweaters made of manmade fibers in Taiwan are
being sold in the United States at less than fair market value, the
Commerce Department says.
   The National Knitwear &amp; Sportswear Association in New York had
filed complaints last September against sweater manufacturers in
South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
   The department said Friday it ruled against the manufacturers in
Hong Kong on July 21 and against those in South Korea on Aug. 3.
   The findings clear the way for the International Trade
Commission to determine whether the products are harming U.S.
industry. If the commission finds U.S. firms are being damaged, the
government can impose duties on the imports to make their prices
comparable to those of U.S. companies.
   The department said the imports represent 72 percent of the $1.3
billion U.S. market and the three countries represent 55 percent of
the imports. It said the value of the sweaters imported from South
Korea in 1989 was $476.1 million; from Hong Kong, $208.8 million,
and Taiwan, $485.5 million.
   The department said the imports are made predominantly of
acrylic fiber. Sweaters containing at least 23 percent wool are
excluded.

<HEAD>Local Review Beginning in 1990 Census</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Local officials across the country are
beginning to receive preliminary housing counts, the Census Bureau
reports.
   Official population numbers won't be issued until at least the
end of the year, though preliminary ones will be sent to state
officials within a few weeks.
   The early housing reports are designed to allow local
governments to challenge the Bureau's findings, pointing out areas
where homes and people may have been missed, officials said.
   The census got under way in March with the mailing of nearly 100
million forms. In recent weeks workers have been going door-to-door
to try to count people who were missed in the first phase.
   Sending the preliminary count to local officials does not mean
that the effort is complete, Census Director Barbara Everitt Bryant
said.
   The figures are open to challenge and workers will be sent out
to double-check areas where officials question the totals.
   In addition to sending housing counts to city, county and town
officials, preliminary population counts will be sent to state
governors, state redistricting officials and members of Congress
who has requested the information.

<HEAD>Cheney Says U.S. Military Could Be In Saudi Arabia For Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEJAS, Azores (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. military commitment to Saudi
Arabia's defense is a ``long-term'' one, Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney says.
   ``Where we'll be a year or two from now, I wouldn't want to
speculate,'' Cheney told reporters Friday on his plane headed for
Saudi Arabia.
   The secretary's four-day swing through several Persian Gulf
nations is his second to the region since Iraqi troops crushed
Kuwait and threatened Saudi Arabia's vital oil reserves.
   As U.S. warships began intercepting Iraqi ships, and the sweep
of U.S. troops continued unabated into Saudi Arabia, the secretary
said he could not put an end point on the massive military endeavor.
   Noting that Iraq has 10 divisions with an estimated 160,000
soldiers in Kuwait, Cheney said, ``It's far too soon for us to talk
about any change in our deployment.''
   Asked about the chance for a decades-long commitment to the
region on the order of a NATO defense, Cheney said, ``What we're
doing now is carrying out the commitment we made to the Saudis 10
days ago, and that commitment is to send a lot of force, enough to
be able to do what the president directed us to do.''
   ``The commitment is long term. The question of how long the
deployments are for will depend upon developments,'' he said.
   Pressed to explain his reference to a years-long commitment, the
secretary replied, ``There's no way I can answer that question. ...
I have said repeatedly that we do not know how long we will have to
stay, I do not know when we will be able to come home.''
   The secretary refused to say how many U.S. soldiers, sailors and
airmen have been deployed to the region, saying only that the flow
was continuing at a brisk pace and that no decision has been made
yet to halt it.
   Pentagon sources have said tens of thousands of troops have
already landed in Saudi Arabia with some 45,000 Marines in line to
be deployed.
   Three aircraft carriers and their battle groups have been
dispatched to the region along with the super-secret F-117A Stealth
fighter-bomber and dozens of F-15 and F-16 jet fighters.
   Asked whether there was enough firepower on the ground to repel
the Iraqi threat, Cheney said: ``We have a lot of capability in
theater. I'd like to have more there before I'll be comfortable
with the situation.''
   The Pentagon has requested that as many as 38 civilian airliners
be turned over to military use for cargo and troop transport while
some of the Army and Marine units are being transferred by
slower-moving ships.
   The secretary was to spend his first evening in the region
aboard the carrier USS Eisenhower in the Red Sea. He planned to
spend most of Sunday visiting Army, Air Force and Marine units at
various sites in Saudi Arabia, but reporters accompanying him were
instructed that they wouldn't be able to describe the exact
location of such units.
   Cheney's plane stopped in the Azores, a group of Atlantic
islands belonging to Portugal, for refueling en route Saudi Arabia.
   The secretary said he added a brief stop in Cairo onto the end
of his trip, which will take him to Bahrain and several other
Persian Gulf states before he returns to Washington early Wednesday.

   Swift military action, not an economic
boycott, is needed to drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait and topple
Saddam Hussein, said a brother of Saudi Arabia's King Fahd.
   Prince Turki bin Abdul Aziz, a former deputy minister of
defense, said he believes the United Nations international embargo
intended to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait cannot work.
   ``This embargo, this boycott, is not going to be useful because
you know there are many merchants of war who make their living by
contributing to the escalation of war among nations,'' Prince Turki
said through an interpreter at a news conference Friday.
   The best course would be for an international force to take
swift military action, the prince said. ``I think if they want to
put a quick end to it, the United States knows how to do that,'' he
said.
   Saddam ``is a sadist and a psychotic. He enjoys killing
people,'' the prince said.
   ``I am not talking about eliminating him physically or
assassination, but they should put an end to his rule _ to his
regime because he is a bloodthirsty person and that's his trade, he
lives off blood,'' he said.
   The prince, 53, also said he was disappointed in King Hussein of
Jordan, who met Thursday with President Bush.
   ``I was hoping that King Hussein would not go down and lower
himself to come to the United States as an emissary of Saddam
Hussein,'' he said. ``I thought he would honor himself further if
he hadn't done so.''
   It was originally believed the king was carrying a message from
Saddam, but Hussein said Thursday that he had no such message.
   The prince, one of the king's seven full brothers, said he came
to Cambridge to talk about how he could enhance Harvard
University's educational programs in medicine and human rights.

   A guerrilla attack on a bus belonging to the
state transport company left one rebel dead and a policeman
injured, police said.
   The attack took place Friday morning in the Lima district of Los
Olivos, according to police sources. Poice said three guerrillas,
two men and a woman, boarded the bus and shot a policeman on board,
leaving him seriously injured.
   The guerrillas attempted to set fire to the bus, but were
prevented by the arrival of a squad car, police said. Police
sources said the officers shot dead one of the guerrillas and
captured the other two.
   In another attack on Thursday afternoon, guerrillas tossed four
sticks of dynamite from a speeding car at a private bus carrying 20
workers in the Lima district of Rimac, police said. Six workers
were injured by the blast, according to the police. No arrests were
announced.
   Police said Wednesday night members of the Maoist Shining Path
guerrilla movement bombed a bank in the district of Comas, on the
outskirts of the capital.
   The guerrillas have distributed leaflets and sprayed graffiti
around the capital urging an armed strike next Tuesday.
   More than 19,000 people have died in clashes between the armed
forces and rebel factions since 1980.

<HEAD>Americans Return to Saudi Arabia Lured by Good Jobs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Well-paid jobs, good benefits and
tax breaks draw Americans back from vacation to the uncertainties
of Saudi Arabia, although some say they are returning only to test
the waters.
   ``I want to pay for college and law school _ otherwise I'll end
up a bartender,'' said 23-year-old James Byrne of Owego, N.Y., one
of several expatriates on Saudi Arabian Airlines flight 24 from New
York to Jiddah Friday.
   Byrne left his wife and 1{-year-old son in New York while he
finishes the second year of a two-year contract with Boeing to
supervise the crew working on the five Saudi-owned AWACS radar
planes and their refueling tankers.
   Byrne, who earns $30,000 a year tax-free and lives on a Boeing
compound where housing is free and amenities are plenty, said he
couldn't afford not to return.
   Still, Byrne said he was concerned about the military situation
and intended to ask his company to provide him with a gas mask
against chemical warfare.
   Byrne said many of his expatriate friends in Saudi Arabia were
also uncertain about whether to leave, but wanted to wait out the
year to avoid paying U.S. taxes.
   Nancy Bonnette of Austin, Texas, also said the financial
incentives for staying are great. She said she and her husband want
to spend between two and four more years in Saudi Arabia.
   To the dismay of friends and family, the Bonnettes never really
thought twice about returning.
   Mrs. Bonnette said her decision was sealed when a friend at the
Pentagon told her the Defense Department viewed the U.S. build-up
as a relatively long-term commitment, and didn't expect an all-out
war with Iraqi troops.
   Others on the flight back to Saudi Arabia said they would wait
and see.
   `We're going back to Jiddah for one week. ... During this week,
if I don't like the feeling I'm getting, I'm leaving,'' said Julie
Hallberg of Balsam Lake, Wis.
   Mrs. Hallberg and her husband, Monte, work at the international
school in Jidah, located on the Red Sea, 1,000 miles from where
American troops are massing near the Persian Gulf.
   Mrs. Hallberg, a physical education teacher, said she left her
children _ ages seven, four and one _ with her parents for a week.
She and her husband will return for the kids if they're satisfied
the situation is calm.
   Mrs. Hallberg said her husband, who remained in Jiddah while she
vacationed with their children in the United States this month, had
told her life was unchanged by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   ``The day it started he didn't really know that much about it,''
Mrs. Hallberg said.
   Mrs. Hallberg said she hopes to stay in Saudia Arabia, where the
family has lived for seven years.
   `You make good benefits and we ended up liking it,'' she said.
   For some, the arrival of thousands of American troops in the
peaceful country represented the end of an era in which foreigners
lived a sheltered, comfortable existence mixing mainly among
themselves.
   ``I've been here nine years and now I don't know what I am going
to do,'' said James Green, a Briton with a photographic studio in
Jiddah.
   Several major U.S. companies have flown dependents out of Saudi
Arabia, suggesting that women and children stay away temporarily.
   Boeing Co. took women and children to headquarters in Seattle
last week, and Aramco, the huge oil consortium has offered to
transport dependents.
   It was unclear how many Americans have left the country. But Bob
Bonnette, a data processer with Saudi Arabian Airlines, said people
living in the Eastern provinces nearer the Kuwait border would feel
less secure.
   The Arab News, an English-language newspaper, reported that
flights into Dhahran which is the center of U.S. troop activity
continue to bring foreign workers into the country.
   It said air traffic _ primarily from India and Pakistan _ was
unchanged from last year. Many workers in the oil fields are Asian.

<HEAD>Iraqi Takeover Leaves Kuwaiti Tankers in Legal Limbo</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iraq's armed takeover of
Kuwait has left five American-flagged oil tankers worth nearly $150
million in legal limbo as to who owns them, shipping industry
sources say.
   The ships are the last of 11 Kuwaiti tankers reflagged by the
United States in mid-1987 to ensure American naval protection from
attacks by Iran in the Persian Gulf.
   They remained under the Stars and Stripes when the other six
reverted to Kuwaiti registry following the Iran-Iraq cease-fire on
August 20, 1988.
   One of the five, The Chesapeake City, reportedly just escaped
seizure when the Iraqi invasion on Aug. 2 caught it forging into
Kuwaiti waters.
   The 401,000-ton crude carrier Bridgeton, the world's sixth
largest ship, and the four oil products tankers of about 80,000
tons each, were last reported at anchor at ports around the gulf
while officials ponder their status, said Walter Oates, a U.S.
Maritime Administration spokesman.
   The vessels have been manned for the past year by American
crews, about 30 per ship.
   Oates, in a telephone interview, said Kuwaiti officials had
recently indicated they wanted to deflag the other five ships,
``But that's obviously a moot point now.''
   Another U.S. maritime source, who declined to be named, said the
ships probably would remain under U.S. jurisdiction pending
clarification of their legal status.
   He said it was ``a strange situation. ... Nobody really knows
what happens next.''
   The Kuwaitis in 1987 set up a Delaware corporation, Chesapeake
Shipping Co., to meet U.S. legal requirements that American-flagged
ships have U.S. owners. The firm could not be reached for comment.
   Philip Wake, a senior consultant for Lloyds Maritime Information
Services in London, said that as long as Delaware Shipping Co.
remains a legal entity, Kuwait probably would be considered the
owner of the tankers.
   ``But when something like this crops up, it's a political
question to a large extent. And when it gets to the lawyers, they
can have a field day,'' he said.
   Wake said an ultra large crude carrier like the Bridgeton is
currently worth about $40 million on the tanker market, with oil
products tankers in the 80,000-ton range worth about $27 million.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein annexed Kuwait after the invasion
and abolished its government. But the United States and other
countries have not recognized the action and froze both countries'
international assets.
   U.S. sources said they did not know the whereabouts of some 15
other state-owned Kuwaiti tankers.
   A sister ship to the Chesapeake City, the Sea Isle City, was
also in the gulf en route to Kuwait and was diverted to the Saudi
Arabian port of Jubail, the sources said.
   The Bridgeton was undergoing a Coast Guard inspection at Khor
Fakkhan just outside the gulf on the day of the takeover. Oates
said it was still there, along with the other two tankers, Ocean
City and Surf City.
   Flying the U.S. flag during the gulf ``tanker war'' entitled the
Kuwaiti vessels to U.S. Navy protection at a time when Iranian
gunboats were attacking commercial shipping in retaliation for
Iraqi air strikes on Iran's own oil tankers and terminals.
   The Iranians singled out Kuwait and Saudi ships because of those
countries' support for Baghdad.
   No reflagged tanker was ever directly attacked while under naval
escort, but the Bridgeton hit a mine and the Sea Isle City was
badly damaged by an Iranian Silkworm missile while at Kuwait to
take on cargo.

   Thirteen carloads of American and other
refugees tore through desert sands to avoid Iraqi troops in a
dramatic escape from Kuwait to Saudi Arabia, a Californian member
of the convoy says.
   ``It was a hectic, rather perilous drive past Iraqi checkpoints
and through uninhabited desert regions between Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia,'' Stephanie McGehee, 37, said after the group made it over
the border Friday.
   McGehee, of Leucadia, Calif., a member of the group and a
part-time photographer and reporter for The Associated Press in
Kuwait, spoke by telephone from the Khafji border post.
   The total number of people in the 13-car convoy was not
immediately clear, although nine people crammed into McGehee's car,
including two other Americans, a Canadian, a Briton and four
Indians, for the four-hour journey.
   On Friday, Iraq ordered Britons and Americans in Kuwait to
report to two hotels, prompting fears they would be taken to
Baghdad as hostages. Many foreigners apparently decided to risk the
Iraqi tanks and desert for freedom.
   McGehee said that she and Canadian Cathy McGregor donned Kuwaiti
floor-length black chadour overcoats. McGregor, in her early 30s,
had been a top executive with the Kuwait SAS Hotel for about five
years.
   And McGehee, who had lived 12 years in Lebanon and Kuwait, said
she used her knowledge of Arabic dialects to talk her way past the
Iraqi invaders who have occupied Kuwait since Aug. 2.
   ``It seems the Iraqis got the impression the entire convoy
comprised only Arab evacuees,'' said McGehee. ``I spoke at length
in Arabic with a mixture of Kuwaiti and Lebanese accents to the
Iraqis at the last checkpoint (15 miles off al-Khafji).''
   The ploy seemed to work at first and none of the other cars were
checked.
   But the Iraqi troops suddenly told the party to return home,
McGehee said.
   They moved a few miles back toward Kuwait, then veered into a
desert expanse and kept driving until they saw some Bedouins who
pointed to the Saudi border.
   ``We breathed a sigh of relief when we saw a sign that showed
clearly we were entering Saudi Arabia,'' said McGehee.
   McGehee and McGregor lived in a house in an old quarter of
Kuwait city, a stone's throw from the Sheraton hotel and the
al-Jahra boulevard.
   The Iraqi invaders punched into Kuwait city with 350 tanks
through al-Jahra at sunrise more than two weeks ago. McGehee
sighted them and phoned the AP a series of reports.
   ``Two days later the going got rough, the risks high,'' she
said. ``Cathy and I had to move to a safer place. The Iraqis were
already rampaging, looting, raping and murdering.''
   They moved to another Western residence, where McGehee tried to
carry on communicating news of the invasion. There they spent 10
days, ``until Westerners began to panic.''
   ``It became extremely dangerous for us Westerners to circulate
in the city and we had to stay indoors most of the time,'' she
said. ``What hurt us most was the long breakdown in telephone and
telex links with the outside world.''
   She said the city became oppressively silent, except for the
staccato of machine gunfire and deafening bomb blasts.
   On the ninth day in hiding, she said, the Iraqis announced they
wanted all U.S. and British expatriates to gather at the
International Hotel, across from the U.S. Embassy compound.
   ``Many of us panicked,'' she said. ``We thought the Iraqis were
bent on moving us to Baghdad where we would be kept hostage.'' She
said she contacted many Westerners, and the decision among them was
unanimous: ``We go.''
   They gathered every car they could find.
   ``Driving along the asphalt road was smooth but frightening,
because the Iraqis were always there,'' she said. ``Our drive
through the desolate desert was much safer, rather comforting, even
though we felt we were moving to nowhere.''

   A British television broadcasting
satellite orbited Earth today after a successful ride into space
aboard an unmanned Delta rocket.
   The liftoff Friday night was nearly two hours behind schedule
because of thunderstorms and last-minute problems with a computer
used to display range data.
   The British Satellite Broadcasting satellite, called Marcopolo
2, will transmit programs directly to thousands of homes in Britain.
   ``One of the nice things about this launch is that it was not
only successful, but the holds (delays) worked out for a night
launch, which is always more spectacular,'' said former astronaut
Charles ``Pete'' Conrad, now a vice president for rocket builder
McDonnell Douglas.
   The satellite separated from the booster as planned about 28
minutes after the 8:42 p.m. liftoff from Cape Canaveral Air Force
Station. An on-board kick motor is to put the satellite into a
22,300-mile-high orbit on Sunday.
   An identical spacecraft, Marcopolo 1, was launched aboard a
Delta rocket last Aug. 27. It was the United States' first
commercial launch of a payload into orbit; Friday's launch was the
ninth.
   The cost of both Marcopolo satellites and launches is about $300
million, said Ellis Griffiths, director of engineering for British
Satellite Broadcasting.
   Marcopolo 2 eventually will be situated over the Atlantic Ocean
near the first satellite. Each 1,450-pound spacecraft has a
lifetime of at least 10 years.
   Once Marcopolo 2 becomes fully operational in early December, it
will enable the company to transmit at full power over five
transponder channels. Only one channel currently is being beamed at
full power; the other four are at half power.
   British Satellite Broadcasting is the only company in the world
that is transmitting television programs directly from orbiting
satellites to homes, Griffiths said. So far there have been no
satellite problems, he said.
   Unlike in the United States, it's not always feasible to mount
large satellite dishes in Britain, Griffiths said. ``In large
blocks of tenements to have huge dishes everywhere, it's just
totally impractical,'' he said.
   About 50,000 units have been installed in British homes so
signals can be received directly from the powerful satellites,
Griffiths said. Each unit consists of a 15.7-inch-square antenna
and a receiver about the size of a videocassette recorder.
   British Satellite Broadcasting expects to have about 1 million
units installed by the end of the year, Griffiths said.

   Ambassadors of the five permanent members
of the Security Council and their senior military aides have held
an extraordinary joint meeting to discuss a larger U.N. military
role in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Also Friday, the Security Council expressed ``anxiety'' over the
fate of foreigners trapped in Kuwait and Iraq and called on the
U.N. secretary-general to take all necessary steps to help them.
   The Security Council was scheduled to meet again today on the
crisis, which began Aug. 2 when Iraqi tanks and troops poured into
Kuwait and then massed at the Saudi Arabian border.
   French Ambassador Pierre Louis Blanc said the five permanent
members of the Council met Friday to ``exchange information on the
naval activities in the gulf and in the area.'' He spoke to
reporters after the meeting at the French mission.
   The meeting was attended by U.N. envoys of the United States,
Britain, China, France and the Soviet Union and by military
advisers of the five governments, together known as the Security
Council's Military Staff Committee.
   The committee was created 44 years ago but has been inactive,
meeting on a perfunctory basis two times a month.
   Diplomats said Friday's meeting was not ordinary. It included
senior U.S., British and French officers. A senior Soviet official
was unable to attend and the level of the Chinese military was not
known.
   No immediate indication surfaced that the five were moving to
form a joint U.N. military command in the gulf, but Western
observers said the group moved with extraordinary speed to discuss
coordination and a U.N. military role.
   ``We won't have a U.N. army tomorrow,'' one observer said on
condition of anonymity. ``But we could have exchange of information
and coordination, letting each other know about rules of
engagement. And that is quite significant.
   ``By U.N. standards, that is whirlwind progress,'' the observer
said.
   Under the U.N. Charter, the Military Staff Committee is charged
with coordinating all U.N. military actions of an enforcement
nature, excluding peacekeeping.
   It is intended to organize and command joint military
operations, which never have come into existence. The last time the
U.N. flag was flown in a U.N. enforcement operation was during the
1950-53 Korean War.
   That war was not strictly a U.N. operation, however, and was
handed over to the United States.
   Moscow has been pressing for an expanded U.N. peacekeeping role
and for revival of the U.N. Military Staff Committee. Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said Friday the Soviet Union would
send troops to the gulf if the United Nations calls for a
multilateral military force.
   Late Friday, the speaker of Iraq's parliament, Sadi Mahdi, said
Iraq will hold all foreigners from ``aggressive nations'' until the
threat of war against his country ends. His statement was carried
by the official Iraqi news agency, monitored in Nicosia.
   Mahdi said foreigners would be spread throughout Iraq, housed in
military and civilian installations.
   Hundreds of thousands of foreigners, including about 4,000
Britons and 2,500 Americans, were stranded when Iraq overran Kuwait
on Aug. 2. Another 500 Americans were in Iraq.

   Pearl Bailey, the singer and actress known
for her throaty drawl, her wit and warmth, is dead at 72. Her
standbys included ``Hello, Dolly!'' and ``Bill Bailey, Won't You
Please Come Home.''
   Bailey collapsed Friday evening at a Holiday Inn where she had
been staying with her husband, jazz drummer Louis Bellson. She was
visiting her two sisters, Eura Robinson and Virgie Murray, and
undergoing physical therapy.
   She died half an hour after being admitted to Thomas Jefferson
Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Kellyann McDonell.
   The cause of death was not immediately known. Bailey had a
history of heart ailments and underwent surgery last month to
replace her arthritic left knee with a metal and plastic joint.
   An autopsy will be conducted in two or three days, McDonell said.
   In 1970, President Nixon named her America's ``ambassador of
love'' to the world. She was a special delegate to the United
Nations under the Ford, Reagan and Bush administrations.
   ``Pearl Bailey was the mother of the world,'' said Stan Irwin,
her manager for 25 years. ``She was a very spiritual woman and she
never recognized color. Her ideology was, `We are humans.'''
   She wrote humorous and inspirational books, including ``Hurry
Up, America, and Spit.'' Last year she published an autobiography,
``Between You and Me.''
   Bailey was well known for playing the conceited Dolly Gallagher
Levi in the black version of the musical ``Hello, Dolly!'' on
Broadway from 1967 to 1969.
   She also appeared on Broadway in ``House of Flowers'' and
``Bless You All,'' and enjoyed a long film career, with her movies
including ``Carmen Jones'' and ``Porgy and Bess.''
   ``I have lost one of the greatest friends I've ever had in my
life,'' said veteran song-and-dance man Cab Calloway, who starred
with Bailey in ``Hello, Dolly!''
   She was one of show business' great personalities, cheering the
loudest at Shea Stadium when the once-hapless New York Mets won the
World Series in 1969 and dragging Johnny Carson from behind his
desk for a fun-filled rendition of ``Our Love is Here to Stay.''
   ``The entertainment world has lost one of the most creative
performers of our time,'' said Carol Channing, who first played
Dolly on Broadway in 1964. ``Her talent was unique and enduring and
her warmth was felt by everyone in the audience.''
   The langorous sexuality of her voice, her warm smile and
eloquent gestures put audiences immediately at ease. Her direct
personality translated smoothly from the nightclub stage and
Broadway to film and television.
   Flipping a feather boa or swathed in chinchilla, ablaze with
rhinestones and jewels, Bailey was renowned for her throwaway style
of singing, a mumbling growl laced with husky patter.
   Among her best-loved songs were ``St. Louis Blues,'' ``Row, Row,
Row,'' and ``That's Good Enough for Me.''
   ``I'm more of a philosopher than a jazz singer,'' she said in a
June interview with The New York Times. ``When people say, `Pearl,
where did you get your style?' I tell them: `I have no style. I
just sing songs.'''
   Bailey, who has been performing 57 of her 72 years, was one of
the few entertainers who could still be called a trouper in the
classic sense.
   But she considered herself foremost a singer.
   ``I'm not a comedienne,'' she once told an interviewer, ``I call
myself a humorist. I tell stories to music and, thank God, in tune.
I laugh at people who call me an actress.''
   Born in Newport News, Va., on March 29, 1918, she was the
daughter of a minister and the youngest of four children. Ancestors
on both sides of the family included Creek Indians.
   She moved with her family as a child to Washington and later
Philadelphia, where she made her debut at age 15, winning an
amateur contest by singing ``Poor Butterfly.'' She moved from
California with her husband of 38 years to the Arizona resort
community of Lake Havesu in 1979.
   She also is survived by a son, Tony, and a daughter, Dee Dee.

<TEXT>
   Typhoon Yancy skimmed the northern
tip of the Philippines' main Luzon island today with wind gusts of
up to 91 miles per hour and was approaching southern Taiwan, the
Manila weather bureau said.
   In a weather bulletin issued at noon (midnight EDT Friday),
Yancy was centered 175 miles northeast of Basco City, the capital
of Batanes province, an island group about 410 miles north of
Manila.
   No casualties or major damage have been reported.
   Forecasters said Yancy gained strength overnight with sustained
winds of 81 mph and gusts of 91 mph. Yancy also slowed down and was
moving west-northwest at 7 mph, forecasters said.
   Senior weather forecaster Daniel Dimagiba said that if Yancy
maintains its present course, the sixth major weather disturbance
to strike the country this year will move out of Philippine
territory by Sunday morning and hit southern Taiwan.
   Dimagiba said Yancy has a radius of 375 miles, which would mean
its effect could be felt as far as the central Philippines.
Provinces in the entire Luzon island, including Manila, have been
placed on storm alert because of this, he added.
   Sea travel in the typhoon's path was ``extremely dangerous'' and
the weather bureau had advised ships and smaller seacraft to stay
in port. Philippine Airlines canceled eight flights from Manila to
the affected areas.
   About 20 typhoons and storms hit the Philippines yearly.

   The Soviet Union is facing a crime wave, and it's
turning for help to the city that gave the world ``Scarface'' Al
Capone and the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.
   The Soviets are hunting down the latest in crime-fighting
techniques from lie detectors to fingerprinting networks to
communication systems.
   ``Their interest really kind of shook me up,'' Matt L.
Rodriguez, a deputy superintendent for the Chicago Police
Department, said Friday.
   A six-member team will leave for Moscow next month to teach
Soviet police how to deal with such antisocial phenomena as bank
holdups, restaurant arson, mugging and auto chop shops.
   The planned exchange follows a spring visit by Soviet officials
who met with experts from Chicago's police department and the
Office of International Criminal Justice at the University of
Illinois.
   ``I recall when they came through here that they were quite
emphatic,'' said Rodriguez, a member of the team. ``They came here
to learn and didn't want any side trips. They wanted business
meetings.''
   Georgi Oganov, a spokesman at the Soviet Embassy in Washington,
D.C., said such crimes as drug trafficking, tax evasion and fraud
are on the rise in the Soviet Union.
   ``This is a group of crimes that accompany any kind of radical
change or economic movement such as we have,'' Oganov said. ``We
have, for 70 years, been very stable ... Obviously, now we have the
upsurge of little-known crimes.''
   Vasily Trushin, a deputy Interior Ministry official, said on
Soviet television last September that serious crime was increasing
throughout the nation.
   He said more than 1.5 million crimes were reported in the Soviet
Union during the first eight months of 1989 _ a 33.2 percent
increase over the same period in 1988. More alarming, Trushin also
reported a 40.8 percent increase in such violent offenses as
murder, rape and robbery.
   The U.S. delegation will be armed with reports from the police
department's organized crime division, one of the first in the
nation to have a fingerprint identification system.
   It also broke ground in the 1960s in the field of criminal
communications and had the first crime laboratory in the nation,
Rodriguez said.

<HEAD>Jordanian Port Could Serve as Sanctions Loophole for Iraq</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AQABA, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This Red Sea port, Jordan's only outlet to
the sea, could prove of crucial importance in the success of the
international effort to clamp sanctions on Iraq and force it to
withdraw from Kuwait.
   Shipping sources say even if the U.S. Navy tries to prevent
merchandise and food supplies from reaching Iraq through Aqaba, it
will be unable to determine what is Jordan's and what is Iraq's.
   Local importers say they are already placing orders for goods
they intend to channel from Aqaba to the eastern border with Iraq,
in violation of mandatory United Nations sanctions imposed since
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2.
   King Hussein has said he will abide by the sanctions but wants
to resolve the issue of how and to what extent sanctions should be
applied by Jordan, whose economy is heavily dependent on trade with
Iraq.
   President Bush, at his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine,
met with Hussein Thursday and said later: ``I can't say I am
satisfied, but what I am is encouraged'' that Jordan intends to
abide by the sanctions decision.
   Asked if the king assured him Jordan would stop Iraqi goods
transiting Aqaba, Bush said flatly ``Yes.''
   But Hussein told reporters that Jordan was still trying to find
out from the U.N. ``exactly what these sanctions mean.''
   The monarch said Aqaba was Jordan's ``only outlet to the sea and
to the rest of the world'' and could not be shut entirely.
   Crown Prince Hassan on Friday told Britain's Independent
Television News that Jordan stands to suffer perhaps more
economically than any other country as a result of the U.N.
sanctions.
   Pending clarification from the United Nations, ships continue to
unload cargo in Aqaba. Scores of heavy trucks, many with the
distinctive yellow Iraqi markings, rumble along the desert highway
on their way inland.
   Daily, many can be seen crossing the border into Iraq.
   ``As long as goods continue to reach Aqaba, ostensibly for the
local Jordanian market, part are bound to find their way across the
border,'' one Jordanian merchant said on condition of anonymity.
   He said local importers, who like most Jordanians are opposed to
the imposition of sanctions against Iraq, are determined to find
ways to continue channeling vital supplies.
   Shipping sources in Aqaba said on condition of anonymity that
the embargo was also strongly opposed by the 5,000 dock workers and
20,000 truck drivers who would lose their jobs if the port were
closed to Iraqi cargo.
   ``All these people have a vested interest for the violation of
the embargo, quite apart from supporting Saddam Hussein like most
Jordanians,'' one source said, referring to the Iraqi president.
   Hassan said the issue was not just one of dollars and cents for
Jordan, but that there is ``tremendous public opinion'' in favor of
Saddam, who is seen among many Arabs as a champion of the poor.
   The prevalent belief among Jordanians is that short of a total
blockade of Aqaba, plugging the sanctions loophole is virtually
impossible.
   There was no unloading of ships at Aqaba on Friday because of
the Moslem weekly holiday. But port officials said normal work
would resume today on the 15 ships docked in the port.
   Before the gulf crisis, an average of 35 ships were in the port
daily, the shipping officials said.
   Lloyd's List International, the authoritative shipping newspaper
of the insurance underwriters, Lloyds of London, said Thursday
sanctions against Iraq had cut cargo handling at Aqaba by 80
percent.
   The newspaper said all cargo bound for Iraq had ceased, although
such exports are difficult to track. The publication estimated that
Aqaba's proportion of cargo destined for Iraq would normally be
about 70 percent.
   The shipping sources said much of the cargo leaving the port by
truck was from warehouses in Aqaba's free port area. They said
stored goods exceeded $10 million in value.

   It's a trip into the groovy world of long hair,
bell-bottom jeans and love beads.
   Promoters say they're expecting thousands of people to turn out
for this weekend's ``Celebration of the '60s Convention,'' a
festival of local pop music and TV cultures of the era.
   Fans from as far as Japan and Australia are expected at the
convention at a downtown hotel featuring actors Davy Jones of ``The
Monkees'' and Butch Patrick, who played Eddie on ``The Munsters.''
   Lead singers from such 1960s Chicago bands as the Buckinghams,
the Cryan Shames, the Mauds and the Ides of March also are billed
for the three-day convention that ends Sunday.
   ``It's just been one big buzz,'' said Australian Jeff Wunsch,
33, one of the 70 fans who showed up Friday night for opening
festivities.
   Wunsch said he took out a loan to travel to the convention.
   ``I just couldn't have missed this,'' he said. ``It's like
seeing old friends. You play their records. You see them on TV.''
   ``We just believe that the music and the culture of the '60s
will never die,'' said organizer Mike Bush. ``People might not
necessarily remember the names of these bands. But if they hear the
melody and a few words, they say `Oh yeah.' It's the music that's
the strong point.''
   Also billed are the Cowsills _ the musical family that inspired
the television show ``The Partridge Family'' and performed such
hits as ``Hair'' and ``The Rain, the Park and Other Things.''
   Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart planned to reunite at the convention.
   The pair, who wrote many of the songs made popular by ``The
Monkees,'' say their songs are still played across the country
because they're uncomplicated and easy on the ear.
   ``We're into teen-age love,'' Hart said. ``All we've ever done
is fun stuff. The stuff people want to remember.''

<TEXT>
   The Soviet and West German foreign ministers say
they have agreed on the main points of a German unification plan
and that the Allies may sign a treaty giving up control in less
than a month.
   ``We are going to change opinions about the future of united
Germany and the Soviet Union,'' Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze predicted at a joint news conference Friday with West
German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   The new treaty will cover cooperation in the economy, trade,
science, technology, culture and Soviet troops stationed in former
communist East Germany, Shevardnadze said.
   The Soviet foreign minister said he expects to initial and
possibly sign the final document giving up the four Allies'
authority over Germany on Sept. 12 in Moscow, as scheduled.
   Shevardnadze and Genscher said they agreed on the essence of the
concluding document on external aspects of unification, although a
few final details remained. Shevardnadze said he expects the other
parties in the ``two-plus-four'' talks to agree with their work.
   The ``two'' are East Germany and West Germany and the ``four''
are the World War II allied victors: the Soviet Union, the United
States, Britain and France.
   Genscher said initialing of the two-plus-four document next
month would show that there is no external reason to prevent German
unification, which he expects to occur Oct. 13-14.
   Shevardnadze said the document might even be signed Sept. 12.
The four powers and the united Germany then would be expected to
ratify the treaty under their respective constitutional processes,
he said.
   Genscher said he expects West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to
spell out details for the Soviet-German treaty proposal in a letter
to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, which would be sent
before the Sept. 12 meeting.
   Shevardnadze said the two sides also had agreed on ``material
and financial concerns regarding the presence and withdrawal of
Soviet troops'' from East Germany. Genscher said final details will
be worked out in meetings between the Soviet and West German
finance ministers Aug. 24.
   West Germany has agreed to help pay for the Soviet soldiers'
upkeep because the Soviet Union is short of convertible currency,
which is necessary now that East Germany has switched to use of the
West German mark.
   Cost of this agreement to West Germany for the second half of
this year is estimated to be $780 million. Genscher also said East
Germany and West Germany will issue statements before Sept. 12 on
their respective final troop ceilings.
   Gorbachev and Kohl agreed at a meeting at a Soviet mountain
resort in July on the most difficult issues of German unification.
These included the united Germany's membership in NATO and
reduction of its combined armed forces from 600,000 to 370,000 over
three to four years.
   The Soviets agreed to withdraw their 380,000 soldiers from East
German territory in the same time period.
   Genscher said the two men also discussed the withdrawal of the
four powers' troops from Berlin. The earlier Kohl-Gorbachev meeting
decided that Western soldiers could stay in Berlin as long as
Soviet troops remained in East Germany.

   Brendan O'Rourke, a boy embraced by Pope
John Paul II in 1987 in a symbolic gesture of compassion and
acceptance of people with AIDS, has died from an AIDS-related
illness. He was 7 years old.
   Brendan, who was born premature and contracted the disease from
a blood transfusion at the age of 2 months, died Friday at the
University of California, San Francisco Medical Center, the
hospital said.
   The cause of death was not given. The boy's mother, Elaine
O'Rourke, said Brendan was hospitalized with pneumonia last month.
   His funeral is scheduled for Monday.
   A photograph of the pope reaching through a crowd to embrace the
boy during the 1987 papal visit to the United States was printed in
newspapers across the world.
   ``That picture tells a great story,'' said Monsignor James. D.
McKay, the former pastor at St. Cecelia's, which the boy's family
attended.
   ``When the pope embraced him, it was sort of a symbol, an
expression of acceptance and compassion and encouragement and
support for him and all the things he represented: children, the
disadvantaged,'' McKay said.
   Brendan met with the pope again during a 1988 visit to the
Vatican for the beatification of Junipero Serra, the founder of
California's mission system. Brendan and his family all received
communion from the pope during the trip.
   Brendan wasn't phased by all the media attention his encounters
with the pope received, his mother said.
   ``He was just a neat kid,'' she said. ``After a while he got to
be a bit of a ham.''
   His knack for humor was evident even during his hospital stay,
she said.
   ``At one time, he was playing harmonica in the hallway with a
sign saying `Please give money,''' Mrs. O'Rourke said. Brendan
collected $7, which he intended to spend on toys.
   ``The last two days he was very sick,'' she said. ``But he went
peacefully this morning.''
   Said McKay, ``He knew he wasn't going to have a long, normal
life. And he seemed to be able to deal with that rather well for
somebody of his age. For somebody even 10 times his age.''

<TEXT>
   President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro
is asking the legislature to pardon at least five men accused of
murdering her popular publisher-husband, a killing that set off the
1979 revolution.
   In a letter to National Assembly speaker Miriam Arguello, the
president expressed hope the pardons of those involved in the fatal
shooting of La Prensa publisher Pedro Joaquin Chamorro will help
pacify the country.
   ``In the spirit of national reconciliation which I am trying to
encourage in our long-suffering Nicaragua, this is an opportune
moment to make this pardon effective,'' Mrs. Chamorro's letter said.
   Excerpts of the covering letter accompanying an amnesty bill
were published Thursday by La Prensa, an afternoon newspaper and
for many years Nicaragua's only opposition daily.
   Mrs. Chamorro took office April 25 after defeating the leftist
Sandinistas by a landslide in elections three months before, and
one her campaign's main promises was to help bring peace and
conciliate feuding factions.
   Pedro Joaquin Chamorro had gained widespread popularity for
denouncing in his newspaper human rights abuses, corruption and
other excesses under President Anastasio Somoza, the last of a long
line of strongmen who ruled Nicaragua with an iron fist for 42
years.
   His automobile was ambushed as he drove to work Jan. 10, 1978,
and he was shot to death on a Managua street. His death set off
days of violent demonstrations and helped rally opponents around
the leftist Sandinista movement which seized power in a revolution
a year later.
   La Prensa continued to expose and criticize government
mismanagement and other excesses under the Sandinistas, who
subjected it to strict censorship and closed it for long periods of
time because of it.
   Mrs. Chamorro asked the legislature to approve the pardons as
soon as possible, saying she ``is confident the National Assembly
will respond with the same sentiments of forgiveness and
reconciliation.''
   Sources at the National Assembly, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the legislature will start debating the bill at its
next session on Wednesday. ``It will be discussed and approved
urgently,'' one source said.
   The draft bill mentions no names but specifies that ``those
favored by this pardon will be freed immediately'' after the
assembly approves it.
   Police at the time arrested five men described as hired guns _
Silvio Pena, Domingo Acevedo, Silvio Vega, Harold Cedeno and Juan
Ramon Acevedo. All were convicted and sentenced from 21 to 30 years
in prison without parole.
   On Thursday, the Sandinista newspaper Barricada said Mrs.
Chamorro also asked that 82 other common criminals be pardoned
along with the five men.
   The Chamorro family, after the Sandinistas took power, also
filed charges against Anastasio Somoza Portocarrere, a son of the
dictator, a Somoza official named Fausto Zelaya and Cuban exile
Pedro Ramos for engineering the murder.
   All three fled into exile after Somoza fell, and Barricada said
Mrs. Chamorro's petition did not specify if they would be included
in the pardon.

   The Grim Reaper has been hauled into a police
station and stripped of his dreaded scythe.
   The spectre of death was actually an actor, Damien Thibodeaux,
who got lost Friday in Boston's financial district while promoting
a murder mystery being staged at a waterfront restaurant.
   Police, alarmed by the reactions he was getting, intervened.
   ``He was just walking around with that thing,'' said Officer
Richard Estrella. ``The kids were scared.''
   Police frisked Thibodeaux, who was dressed in a black cowl and
wore pale makeup, and took him back the police station. No charges
were filed, but officers told Thibodeaux they would keep his sickle
and return it to his employer.
   Thibodeaux, who is originally from Louisiana, said he had just
moved to Boston.
   ``I was promoting a dinner theater show for (Comedy) Showcase
Productions and my job was to pass out fliers around town,'' he
said. ``It's my first job in Boston. I won't be doing it again.''

   It's official. The more than 12,000 members in Illinois' 212
square dancing clubs can now allemande and bow their corners to the
call of the newly designated state symbol.
   Gov. James R. Thompson signed legislation Friday at the Illinois

   ``Square dancing is as endemic to Illinois as the prairie plants
that border our agricultural landscape,'' Thompson said.
   ``It is fitting that we recognize the significance of our
particular regional favorite, the square dance,'' he said.
   Similar legislation has been approved in 11 other states.

   Showers fell in the Midwest early today and fog settled over
much of the East. Skies were mostly clear around the rest of the
country.
   The East was looking for continued hot, humid weather with highs
in the 80s and 90s and thunderstorms stretching from Maine to Ohio.
   A high pressure system was expected to bring stifling heat and
humidity to the South. Skies were expected to be sunny, expect for
some thunderstorm activity in Florida and Georgia, with
temperatures climbing into the 90s.
   A large band of showers and thunderstorms were forming over the
Midwest, extending from the Dakotas into Wisconsin and Oklahoma.
   Autumn-like weather was arriving in the Great Lakes, with strong
high pressure from Canada driving temperatures into the 50s.
   Rain was also expected in the Pacific Northwest, with cool air
spreading showers around the region. The highs for most of the area
were expected to be in the 90s.
   Some parts of Southern California and a large section of Arizona
could expect temperatures to rise above 100 degrees.
   The nation's high temperature Friday was 105 degrees at Borrego
Springs, Calif., Havasu City and Yuma, Ariz.

<TEXT>
   The United States has formally handed over
one of its military bases, making the naval communications station
the first of two installations to close in Greece under
Washington's worldwide defense cuts.
   Control of the Nea Makri base, 20 miles northeast of Athens, was
officially passed to the Greek navy during a flag-lowering ceremony
Friday.
   The facility was set up in 1963 to electronically monitor ships
in the Aegean and serve as a communications link for the U.S. 6th
Fleet in the Mediterranean.
   At the height of operations, 312 U.S. active-duty staff were
employed at the base and 125 local employees.
   U.S. authorities have been winding down operations at Nea Makri
since April when they pulled down the base's tallest antenna to
symbolize the impending closure.
   Rear Adm. Peter H. Cressy, Commander Fleet Air Mediterranean,
represented the United States at the closing ceremony along with
U.S. Ambassador to Greece, Michael Sotirhos. Representing the Greek
navy was Rear Adm. Iraklis Krikos.
   Striking Greek personnel at the facility demonstrated during
Friday's ceremony under a long-running pay dispute with base
officials. They claim to be owed $36 million in back pay and social
security contributions.
   The strikers also demand new jobs in the Greek civil service on
closure of Nea Makri, and another U.S. base at Hellenikon, near
Athens.
   Hellenikon air base, established in 1947, is scheduled to close
early next year.
   The United States' two remaining bases, both on the northern
coast of Crete, will continue to operate under an eight-year
defense pact signed by the two countries last July.
   The Souda Bay naval facility provides support for U.S. naval
forces in the Mediterranean while reconnaisance aircraft use a
nearby airfield.
   Iraklion air station is an electronic surveillance and relay
base. It monitors radio communications and Soviet activity in the
Mediterranean.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Russian Prime Minister Ivan Silayev has urged
exiled writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn to accept his restored Soviet
citizenship and return home as Silayev's guest, according to media
reports today.
   In a letter published on the front page of Sovietskaya Rossia
newspaper, Silayev said Solzhenitsyn's homecoming was ``one of
those moves that our homeland needs as much as air.
   ``The interests of the state and its future destiny compel me to
ask you and your family to accept an invitation to be my personal
guests at any time you choose,'' wrote Silayev, premier of the
largest Soviet republic.
   Solzhenitsyn, 71, was one of 23 people whose citizenship was
restored Wednesday by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who also
apologized for two decades of political repression by previous
Soviet leaders.
   The Nobel Prize-winning Solzhenitsyn, 71, was arrested for
treason in February 1974, forced onto a plane to Germany and
stripped of his citizenship.
   He now lives in Cavendish, Vt., and says he won't return unless
all his books have been published in the Soviet Union and are
widely available.
   Solzhenitsyn's wife, Natalia, said her husband also wants the
expulsion order and treason charges lifted before he will consider
taking back his Soviet citizenship.
   Solzhenitsyn's books include ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' about
the horrors of Josef Stalin's prison camps, ``One Day In The Life
Of Ivan Denisovich,'' ``Cancer Ward,'' ``August 1914'' and ``The
First Circle.''
   Several of his works have been published in the Soviet Union but
few novels from any author are widely available in the
shortage-plagued society.
   Silayev, calling Solzhenitsyn ``the great son of the Russian
people,'' said his invitation was motivated ``by the common love of
the long-suffering Russian land and its people.
   ``Your words about Russia have rung out the world over, invoking
its fate in the cruel and ruthless 20th century,'' he wrote.
``Today, your words have reached our homeland as well, and they are
needed everywhere, in all walks of life, religious and spiritual,
cultural, public and economic.''
   Silayev said that at a time Soviet society is going through
tumultuous and divisive changes, ``your coming to Russia is, in my
view, one of those moves that our homeland needs as much as air.''
   Soviet officials have identified only 10 of the 23 people whose
citizenship Gorbachev restored under presidential decree. They were
deprived of their rights as Soviet citizens between the years 1966
and 1988.
   Besides Solzhenitsyn, they are chess champion Victor Korchnoi;
writers Vasily Aksyonov, Vladimir Voinovich, Lev Kopelev, Georgi
Valdimov and Valeri Tarsis; scientists Yuri Orlov and Valeri
Chalidze; and artist Oskar Rabin.
   The full list is to be published later this month.

   A man who killed his 2-year-old stepson by
plunging him headfirst into a toilet escaped being condemned to
death because the judge thought a death penalty would be overturned
on appeal.
   ``I feel the court has no choice but to follow the jury's
recommendation for life'' in prison, Circuit Judge Randall McDonald
ruled Friday.
   Thomas Coe, 23, must serve 25 years before being eligible for
parole. He was convicted of first-degree murder and aggravated
child abuse in the death of Bradley McGee.
   In response to the killing, the state Legislature rewrote child
welfare laws to put the child's safety above the goal of keeping
families together, and allocated $79 million for more
child-protection social workers.
   McDonald said the sentence was appropriate, since he could find
no case where the death penalty was upheld for a child-abuse murder.
   ``I guess you can get the death penalty if you kill a man,''
responded Pam Kirkland, the child's foster mother for 14 months.
``But you get life if you kill a child.''
   Bradley died of massive head injuries July 28, 1989, only two
months after he was ordered returned to Coe, and his mother, Sheryl
McGee Coe.
   Coe testified being angered when he picked up Bradley by the
ankles and slammed him into the commode as a punishment for soiling
his pants. But he said he never meant to harm the child.
   Coe's wife testified that her husband routinely ground his fist
and cayenne pepper into Bradley's genitals, and forced him to pick
his feces off the floor with his mouth.
   Mrs. Coe, 21, earlier this year pleaded no contest to
second-degree murder and aggravated child abuse in her son's death
and is serving a 30-year prison term.
   Jurors who convicted Coe on July 30 were deadlocked 6-6 in the
penalty phase, resulting in an automatic recommendation for life.
   Defense attorney Robert Norgard said he planned to appeal both
the conviction and sentence. Prosecutors refused comment.
   Bradley's death sparked public outrage because it occurred while
he was under the supervision of state social workers.
   Bradley's main caseworker, Margaret Barber, was convicted of
child abuse for disregarding a psychological report that described
the Coes as unfit parents. She was sentenced to three years'
probation.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six months after Soviet tanks
began rolling out, the Rolling Stones have rolled in, marking a
high point for the new cultural freedom long denied by the
country's ousted Communist rulers.
   The band plays for the first time in Czehoslovakia today at
Prague's Strahov Stadium, listed in the Guiness Book of World
Records as the world's largest, with a capacity for 240,000 people.
   ``It's a great opportunity for us to play to people who could
never hear us before,'' Keith Richards, the band's lead guitarist
said in a documentary aired Thursday on state television.
   Proceeds of the concert will go to the Czechoslovak Children's
Foundation, which benefits handicapped children, Romanian refugees
and victims of the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl, according to
media reports in London. The charity is headed by Olga Havel, wife
of Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel.
   Unused for the last five years, the stadium was given a new coat
of paint before technicians started assembling the mammoth sound
system and elaborate stage for the Rolling Stones concert.
   Close to 100,000 thousand people are expected to enjoy
``Sympathy For The Devil,'' ``Jumping Jack Flash'' and other hits
from the band's 25-year-long career, rarely heard publicly in
Czechoslovakia under Communist rule.
   On Feb. 26 Soviet tanks began leaving Czechoslovakia, ending two
decades of military occupation and sealing the fate of
Czehoslovakia's hard-line Communist rulers, ousted in a popular
revolution late last year.
   And on Aug. 12, the first truck of The Rolling Stones world tour
started rolling into Prague, marking the new winds of
liberalization after forty years of Communist rule and
state-decreed culture.
   The impact of the Stones' arrival has been dramatic in Prague,
where over the years fans have had to buy the band's albums at
inflated prices on the black market.
   ``It's a dream come true, something I never hoped to see in my
life,'' said Ivan Kadanka, a 43-year-old drummer, whose band will
perform as a support act to the Rolling Stones show. ``It's a
unique experience, something I am going to tell my children and
grandchildren about.''
   If the emotional content of the performance is overwhelming for
musicians, the sheer size of the show exceeds the imagination of
Czech promoters.
   ``When we started talking about it in May, we were six people
who put together $400 of capital, and started daydreaming about a
show that costs $1.5 million to produce,'' said Milan Pesik of Mars
Productions, a promotion group.
   Pesik said the Stones thought the promotion group was ``a bunch
of phonies who wanted to have fun at the band's expense.'' It was
only the invitation of President Havel that got things moving, he
said.
   Soon an unprecedented publicity campaign was unleashed in the
country's media, a stranger to the hype of big-time show business.
   ``Hi, I'm Mick Jagger. The Stones are rolling into Prague,'' the
band's singer and leader said in Czech to millions of TV viewers
for two weeks, several times a day. That message established Jagger
as a household name in a country that in the past had virtually
banned rock music.
   A gigantic red tongue in a huge mouth _ the Stones's traditional
logo _ appeared atop a hill where a statue of Soviet dictator
Joseph Stalin once stood. The hill, the summit of which is called
Letna Plain, looks out over the city center.
   A video screening of the show on the American leg of the show
was held on Prague's Old Town Square Monday and attracted about
10,000 viewers.
   Supraphon, the state record company and Bonton, its newly born
private competitor, released the band's latest album, ``Steel
Wheels,'' on unusually short notice in a country where world hits
usually reach the charts years after their popularity has faded in
the West.
   But for some, the Stones concert has a particular meaning at a
time Czechoslovakia struggles to implement market and democratic
reforms.
   ``The important thing I see in an event like this is not only
... the fun and razzle dazzle,'' said Cenek Petak, a veteran
saxophone player. ``It's a way of showing the people that it takes
years to become that good. It takes tradition, positive attitude
and lots of hard work.
   ``It's something you cannot achieve overnight by waving a magic
wand, and that I think is a message this country should hear right
now,'' Petak said.

   The father of a 14-year-old girl whose India-bound plane was
intercepted in Kuwait by invading Iraqi troops implored the
government of Saddam Hussein to release her.
   ``I'm hoping and I'm praying and I'm making a desperate plea to
the Iraqi government,'' said Dr. Chandra Polam, a Pittsburgh
cardiologist. ``She's a child. She's by herself. Show mercy.''
   The British Airways plane was intercepted by Iraqi soldiers when
it made a stopover in Kuwait on an Aug. 2 flight to New Delhi.
Vinil Polam, going to visit her grandparents, joined the thousands
of Americans caught up in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Airline officials have told Polam his daughter is safe at a
hotel near the Kuwait airport. But that has done little to allay
more than two weeks filled with anxiety, confusion and frustration.
   The sense of alarm that relatives feel was heightened Friday
when the speaker of Iraq's parliament said all foreigners from
``aggressive nations'' _ presumably including the 3,000 Americans
in Iraq and Kuwait _ would be held until the threat of war against
his country ends.
   He said they would be spread throughout the country, housed in
military and civilian targets.
   Relatives of other Americans and foreigners stranded in Kuwait
and Iraq by the invasion are desperately seeking news of their
loved ones. Some have organized support groups. Others are eating
and sleeping by their telephones.
   For Mary Trundy, waiting for word from her twin brother trapped
in Kuwait is all frighteningly familiar. In 1979, 43-year-old John
Stevenson escaped from Iran just hours before militants seized the
U.S. Embassy.
   ``It's a nightmare that doesn't end,'' Trundy said from her home
in Brockton, Mass., about 20 miles south of Boston. ``It's just too
much now, two times in a row.''
   Stevenson called his sister twice the day of the invasion, and
hoped to escape to Saudi Arabia the following day.
   ``He said it was just like Iran again, only that they weren't
shooting in the streets,'' she said.
   In eastern Iowa, Nedra Hanken of Monticello awaited word of her
31-year-old daughter, Beth, who has lived with her husband the past
five years in Kuwait.
   ``We haven't heard anything and I don't know that any other
American families have, either,'' she said.
   In New Harmony, Ind., Joan Khaja's 12 brothers and sisters were
concerned when she left home for Kuwait last month, five months
pregnant, to take her two small children to visit their
grandparents.
   Now that concern has turned to fear, and Khaja's family
maintains a 24-hour vigil near television and telephone.
   In Odessa, Texas, Donnita Cole said, ``You wait for the
telephone to ring. When it doesn't ring, you worry to death.''
   Her husband is an employee of OGE Drilling Co. and has been
living in Kuwait City.
   Mrs. Cole said she had developed a mini-support network of other
families in the same situation.
   ``We kind of give each other moral support when one of us starts
to crack a little,'' she said. ``I think we're going to be in for
quite a long spell on this.''

   Iraq threatened today to use weapons of
``mass destruction'' against any attacker. It did not specify the
weapons it referred to, but Baghdad has an arsenal of chemical
weapons and long-range missiles.
   Also today, Iraq indicated for the first time that it would use
soldiers who had been deployed against Iran to bolster troops
facing a growing multinational force in Saudi Arabia.
   Iraq on Friday began withdrawing thousands of troops from
Iranian territory occupied since their 1980-88 war. The Iraqi army
daily, al-Qaddasiyah, declared today in an editorial that the 30
divisions which had been facing Iran in the north would now be
deployed in the south.
   The daily said the troops ``which are leaving Iran's borders ...
and the high readiness of our air force will be an additional might
to what we had already prepared against the aggressive forces.''
   Al-Qaddisiyah also said Baghdad was prepared to use all the
weapons at its disposal against aggressors.
   ``Weapons of mass destruction and strategic deterrence possessed
by Iraq will be lying in wait to turn those who contemplate
committing aggression into scattered pieces,'' the daily said.
   Iraq has used chemical weapons against its own Kurdish minority,
and against Iranian forces during the Iraq-Iran war.
   It was not known how many of the 30 Iraqi divisions, more than
200,000 men, would be moved to Kuwait or the Saudi front. The
Iraqis are believed to have at least seven divisions in Kuwait and
more than 120,000 troops massed on the border with Saudi Arabia.
   Another newspaper, the government-run al-Thawra, said President
Bush's order authorizing U.S. ships to intercept vessels heading to
or from Iraq violated international law. Foreign Minister Tariq
Aziz called on other nations to oppose Bush's move.
   The Iraqi News Agency said al-Thawra asserted Iraq's
determination to confront the United States if necessary.
   ``Bush orders to U.S. warships to intercept all ships heading to
Iraq and leaving it is a clear violation to the United Nations
charter and the basis of international laws,'' the daily said.
   Aziz said Bush's order set a precedent for any nation to
intercept shipping ``if the world does not reject this abnormal
behavior and foil it to defend the international law,'' INA
reported.

<TEXT>
   The husband of ousted Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto today claimed that police are encouraging his
friends and associates to help authorities him on corruption
charges.
   ``They're taking them in every day telling them to sign blank
letters,'' said Asif Ali Zardari, who accompanied his wife back to
the federal capital for the first time since her government was
dismissed nearly two weeks ago.
   In the past week, several people have been arrested in Ms.
Bhutto's home province of Sindh on charges ranging from corruption
to gun-running.
   ``It's a very calculated effort to get to her (Ms. Bhutto)
through me,'' Zardari said. ``If they hit me, it hurts her.''
   Riot police held back hundreds of wailing women today trying to
catch a brief glimpse of the former prime minister as she addressed
3,000 supporters.
   ``We don't want to go into any court other than to the court of
the people,'' Ms. Bhutto said. ``I don't need any certificate of
clearance from this government.''
   A stunned Ms. Bhutto left the federal capital on Aug. 7 after
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed her 20-month-old government
on a variety of charges ranging from corruption to ineptitude.
   Ishaq Khan appointed a caretaker Cabinet of Ms. Bhutto's enemies
and former allies. He has proposed judicial tribunals to
investigate corruption charges.
   Zadari stood by his wife as she addressed her supporters.
   Her opponents have labeled him ``Mr. 10 Percent,'' a reference
to the amount he's accused of charging people seeking government
contracts. Ms. Bhutto and Zardari have repeatedly denied the
charges, and none has been proved.

   Zoia Ceausescu, daughter of deposed
and executed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, was released from jail
this morning, where she had been detained while under investigation
for corruption.
   She was picked up from the central Bucharest prison by her
brother Valentin, who was released Friday. The two refused to speak
to reporters and left in a five-car convoy to an unknown
destination.
   Also released today were Zoia's husband, Mircea Oprean, and
Poliana Cristescu, the former wife of the late dictator's youngest
son, Nicu.
   All four had been accused of various counts of corruption and
``undermining the national economy.'' The four had been under
arrest since the December revolution that overthrew of Nicolae
Ceausescu, a Communist hard-liner.
   Although the military prosecution had asked for a 30-day
extension of their detention, the Bucharest military tribunal
decided the investigation into their crimes ``can be carried out
without maintaining their state of preventative detention.'' It is
unclear when their trials could take place.
   The trial of Nicu reopens on Tuesday in the central town of
Sibiu, where he had served as Communist Party boss under his
father. He is also charged with ``complicity in genocide'' for
allegedly ordering the shooting of demonstrators during the
December revolution.
   Nicu was widely regarded as a playboy with political ambitions,
but Zoia and Valentin had distanced themselves from their father's
iron-fisted and corrupt rule.
   The trial of Nicolae Ceausescu's sister, Maria Agache, also
charged with corruption, reconvened briefly Thursday, then
adjourned until Sept. 13.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Egypt today asked Arab foreign ministers to
meet in Cairo in a week to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis brought
on by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Hassaan el-Abbadi, Egypt's assistant foreign minister, told
reporters the meeting of the Arab League council ministers was
proposed for Aug. 26.
   The ministers were to hear a report from Chadli Klibi, the
league's secretary-general, on whether a resolution adopted by an
Arab summit in Cairo on Aug. 10 is being implemented.
   That resolution sanctioned the dispatch of Arab forces to Saudi
Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries requesting help in
defending against a possible Iraqi attack.
   The measure, approved by 12 of the Arab League's 21 members,
also demanded immediate withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait and
reinstatement of the Kuwaiti government the Iraqis ousted after the
Aug. 2 invasion.
   The resolution called on Klibi to report back to the League's
council ``within 15 days'' on its implementation.
   Except for dispatch of Arab troops to Saudi Arabia, little has
been done to carry it out. But Arab diplomatic sources said the aim
of the meeting was probably to keep pressure on Baghdad.
   Mubarak has been a leader in diplomatic efforts to end the
crisis, including a mediation bid just prior to the invasion. He
also organized the Aug. 10 Arab League meeting, which came two days
after Kuwait's annexation.
   The gathering brought heated arguments by the Iraqi delegation
and the representatives of the deposed Kuwait government.
   Mubarak has said he still hopes for a peaceful resolution to the
crisis.
   The Iraqis say the annexation of Kuwait is irrevocable, and
Baghdad considers the emirate a southern region of Iraq.
   Egypt has sent a force to Saudi Arabia that President Hosni
Mubarak says will not exceed 2,000 men. Morocco was reported to
have sent 1,200 men and Syria a handful of staff officers.

<TEXT>
   Black factions fought running
battles today with axes, spears and homemade guns, raising the toll
from this week's fighting to more than 200 dead and hundreds
wounded.
   The anti-apartheid African National Congress on Friday accused
the government of encouraging the violence in the black townships
to justify repressive measures and to prolong white rule.
   Police fired tear gas to disperse rival bands of Zulus, a tribe
that has largely rejected a future government controlled Nelson
Mandela's ANC, and the pro-ANC Xhosas in the sprawling black
township of Soweto.
   War bands burned houses and stoned vehicles, witnesses said.
   The country's top police official, Gen. Johann Van Der Merwe,
today ordered military and police reinforcements to Soweto, where
at least 53 people have been killed and more than 300 wounded since
Thursday. So far, only armed police have patrolled in Soweto.
   ``This strong contingent will do everything possible to stop the
senseless violence,'' Van Der Merwe said in a statement.
   ``It's a very tense situation. There's a lot of tension and
people are arming themselves,'' one witness said.
   Officials put the total dead at 205 in clashes that began Sunday.
   Police armed with assault rifles and shotguns roared through
parts of Soweto in armored vehicles and trucks. Youths who built
barricades with rocks and burning tires were dispersed with tear
gas.
   Police and residents also reported looting and indiscriminate
gang attacks on individuals. A family of six, including a
5-month-old baby and three other children, were badly burned when a
firebomb was thrown into their shack in Kagiso township, north of
Soweto.
   The bloody conflict erupted in the township of Thokoza east of
Johannesburg on Sunday, and spread during the week to four more
areas, including Soweto, southwest of Johannesburg. The fighting
pits Zulus of the Inkatha movement against mostly Xhosa supporters
of the African National Congress.
   The ANC accused the government's security forces Friday of
plotting to use Inkatha to stir up tribal rivalry in the townships
around Johannesburg. More than 5,000 people have died in fighting
between Inkatha and ANC supporters in the eastern Natal province in
the past five years.
   The ANC issued a statement saying state security forces in
collusion with Inkatha were trying to ``spread a climate of fear
and terror in the towns which are known to be strongholds of the
ANC. They want to provoke a mass backlash among blacks and whites
in support of tough repressive measures by the government in order
to undermine the process towards peace.''
   The spreading unrest led to an unscheduled meeting Thursday
between Mandela and President F.W. de Klerk. They have been meeting
to clear the way for formal negotiations on an end to white
minority rule.
   Inkatha President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said ANC supporters
``frequently insult, denigrate and attack Inkatha members on the
trains, in the buses, and other places, which has resulted in the
conflict in Soweto.''
   Buthelezi, making his statement in Ulundi in Natal province,
said Inkatha was committed to democracy and opposed to violence.
But, he said, ANC slurs against Inkatha had been extremely
provocative and ``until respect for one another is observed, it
will be difficult to obtain peace.''

<HEAD>Minister Indicates Saudis Will Increase Oil Output</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia plans to increase its
oil output by up to 2 million barrels a day to help offset the
shortfall on world markets caused by the Iraqi invasion, the oil
minister indicated today.
   But he said Saudi Arabia alone cannot make up for the 4 million
barrels of oil a day that international markets lost when Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and most nations responded by imposing an
oil embargo on Baghdad.
   By invading and annexing Kuwait, Iraq gained control of about 20
percent of the world's oil reserves, and the withdrawal of its
crude from the market has caused oil and gas prices to soar.
   The Saudi oil minister, Hisham Nazer, spoke with reporters today
at a news conference in the summer capital of Jiddah.
   He said that if an emergency session of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries proposed by the kingdom does not
occur ``then it will be left for each member state to decide
alone'' on the increase in output.
   He said that even if Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil
exporter, increases its output by the maximum of 2 million barrels
a day, it cannot make up for the 4 million barrels daily that the
sanctions on Iraq and occupied Kuwait removed from world markets.
   Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates could increase output by
half a million barrels per day, Nazer said, but ``this would leave
us with 1 million barrels less.''
   Meanwhile, the turmoil in the Middle East, where thousands of
U.S. troops are being deployed to defend Saudi Arabia against a
possible Iraqi attack, contineu to create havoc on world markets.
   Unleaded gasoline hit a record high Friday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, as crude oil prices shot up and speculators
kept betting that the Middle East standoff would curtail supplies.
   September wholesale unleaded gas futures soared to as high as
96.25 cents before settling at 95.97 cents per gallon, up 8.5 cents
from Thursday's record close.
   The September contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude, finished up $1.27 at $28.63 per barrel.
   For the week, September crude rose $2.40 per barrel, while
unleaded gasoline was up 16.5 cents a gallon.

   An estimated 1,000 homes were morning as
rivers swollen by an 8-inch rainfall threatened to rupture the Lake
Tomah dam, authorities said.
   Hundreds of residents were evacuated from around the Lemonweir
River in Tomah after the Friday night rainstorm, said Carleen
Pearson of the Monroe County Police.
   ``It's chaotic,'' said Donette Gorbet of the Tomah Police.
``We're telling everybody to stay away from Tomah.''
   About 300 people were transported to a Tomah junior high school
gymnasium, said authorities in this west-central Wisconsin town of
7,000.
   Although flooding left the dam in a precarious condition, water
pressure on the dam was beginning to recede by midmorning,
authorities said. Tomah Police Lt. Chris Anderson said the
situation should come under control later in the day.
   A 25- to 30-mile stretch of Highway 12-16 and parts of
Interstate 90 between Oakdale and Sparta also were closed, Pearson
said.
   The rain soaked the town over a three-hour period Friday night.
Assistant Fire Chief Stu Westphall said the city was in ``a mess.''
   No deaths or injuries have been reported. No damage estimate was
available.
   The city's ambulance service, civil defense and police
department were involved in the evacuation, she said.

   The judge in the Central Park rape trial denied
a defense motion for a mistrial and jurors failed to reach a
verdict at the end of the ninth day of deliberations.
   Justice Thomas Galligan of Manhattan state Supreme Court called
jurors late Friday and told them to break for the day and resume
deliberations today.
   Michael Joseph, attorney for defendant Antron McCray, said he
asked for the mistrial because he didn't want the jurors to reach a
verdict if they were tired or felt pressure to render a decision.
   Earlier, jurors saw for the third time during deliberations a
videotape of McCray's statement to police, and had testimony read
back to them from McCray's parents, who contend their son's
statement was coerced.
   In the videotape, Antron McCray said he kicked the jogger and
feigned having sex with her to impress his friends.
   McCray, 16, Salaam, 16 and Raymond Santana, 15, are accused of
raping and trying to kill the jogger in the park the night of April
19, 1989.
   They also are charged with attacking two male joggers in the
park that night. The other charges against the youths include
sexual abuse, riot, assault and robbery.
   The woman, now 30, eventually recovered and returned to her job
as a Wall Street investment banker. She testified that she suffers
from impaired balance, vision and smell as a result of the attack
and cannot recall what happened that night.

   A group of masked youths attacked members of
a right-wing political party as they passed out leaflets in East
Berlin on Saturday, and seven people were reported injured.
   About 30 members of the far-right Republican Party were working
at an information booth near an East Berlin subway station Saturday
morning when a group of youths attacked them, the East German news
agency ADN said.
   The attackers carried rocks and knives and punched and kicked
the Republicans, the news agency said. The injured sustained cuts
and bruises, and one party member suffered a heart attack and was
hospitalized, ADN said.
   Police said they were searching for the attackers.
   The Republicans are a West German political party that advocates
sharp restrictions on the rights of foreigners to live in the
country.
   The party has been given permission to enter candidates in the
Oct. 14 elections to create five state governments in East Germany.
East Germany will be reduced to those five states when it joins
with West Germany by year's end.

   A court in southern Vietnam has put
members of two religious groups on trial on charges of
anti-government activity, Vietnam's state radio reported.
   It said the Ho Chi Minh City People's Court tried members of the
groups on ``the charge of taking advantage of their religion to
spread propaganda against the revolutionary administration and the
socialist regime.''
   The radio identified the groups as the ``Small Soul
Organization'' and the ``High-Tide Movement of Maria Catholic
Priests.'' The radio gave no other details.
   A transcript of the broadcast Friday was seen Saturday in
Bangkok.
   Communist authorities in Vietnam have had poor relations with
Catholics and other religious groups, although the climate has
improved since more pragmatic party officials came to power in late
1986.
   In recent months, however, authorities have been blaming
religious and other groups for trying to destablize the government
as it braces for the loss of crucial aid from the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe.

   Republican National Committee Chairman Lee
Atwater was alert after undergoing radiation therapy for brain
tumor ``progression,'' a spokeswoman said today.
   The spokeswoman, Leslie Goodman, didn't respond directly when
asked about reports that doctors had discovered a second tumor in
the brain of the 39-year-old Atwater.
   She said physicians ``were not specific on that.''
   Two South Carolina newspapers today quoted unidentified sources
as saying doctors had discovered a new growth.
   ``Their statement was that there has been tumor progression and
that's about as much as we know and about as far as they intend to
go in their description,'' she said.
   ``His condition is unchanged,'' Goodman said. ``He's alert,
seeing visitors and did undergo radiation treatment yesterday.''
   An RNC statement issued late Thursday had said a biopsy
performed on Atwater this week ``indicated tumor progression
requiring additional treatment.'' The statement also said Atwater
began receiving radiation treatment Wednesday.
   The State newspaper in Columbia, citing close friends of
Atwater, and The News &amp; Courier of Charleston, citing a source
close to the situation, reported the discovery of a second tumor.
   Goodman said in response to those reports that doctors ``aren't
sure whether it's a new tumor or part of the old tumor.''
   Meanwhile, a circle of family _ including Atwater's mother _ and
close friends on Friday rallied to support Atwater as news spread
that his condition had worsened.
   A friend described Atwater, who managed President Bush's 1988
campaign, as ``very, very weak.''
   Atwater, who underwent brain tumor surgery on April 3, has been
in and out of the hospital repeatedly for treatment of ailments
ranging from a blood clot in his leg to a nagging fever.
   Until this week, however, doctors thought the small tumor in the
right side of his brain was virtually gone. On Thursday, RNC Chief
of Staff Mary Matalin said physicians who have been treating
Atwater ``all concur this development is concerning.''

<HEAD>Iraq Has Soviet Bombers That Can Deliver Chemical Weapons</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iraq has Soviet bombers capable of delivering
chemical and conventional weapons with pinpoint precision anywhere
in the Persian Gulf and eastern Mediterranean, Jane's Defense
Weekly reported Saturday.
   The Sukhoi Su-24 Fencer low-level strike bombers present the
U.S.-led multinational force in the Persian Gulf ``with its gravest
military threat,'' Jane's said in its Aug. 18 issue.
   U.S. military intelligence sources estimate that the Iraqi air
force has about 10 of the aircraft, the magazine said.
   It said the Su-24 Fencer is similar to the US F-111 and has a
combat range of about 650 miles, without the need to refuel.
   ``With a midair refueling capability, almost certainly possessed
by the Iraqis, range would be limited only by the endurance of its
two-man crew,'' said the magazine.
   Although primarily designed to attack land targets, Jane's said
the aircraft could also be used against ships. It can carry the
full range of Soviet tactical weapons, many of which are in Iraqi
hands, it said.
   ``In capable hands it is a formidable weapon, although the Iraqi
air force's ability to master its operation is under some doubt,''
the Jane's article said.
   U.S. intelligence sources believe Iraq has had Fencers since the
beginning of the year but it is not known whether they are owned by
Iraq or on loan from the Soviet Union, the magazine said.
   Iraq, which signed a friendship treaty with the Soviet Union in
1972, has long wanted the Su-24 but experts believe Moscow refused
to supply them out of fears of destabilizing the Middle East,
Jane's said.
   The magazine said it is likely that Moscow, under pressure from
Iraq to supply intermediate-range missiles, instead agreed to
supply the Fencers.

<HEAD>A Pamphlet To Arm Voters Against Manipulation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A new political reform group believes
thousands of Americans are willing to spend $3 each to become
better citizens.
   The Center for National Independence in Politics has set up a
900-number telephone line to take orders for the ``Voter's
Self-Defense Manual,'' an eight-page pamphlet small enough to fit
in a shirt pocket.
   Its purpose: to give voters a way to get around the
manipulations of today's political campaigns, to see behind the
commercials and gimmicks.
   In addition, the $3 call to 1-900-820-CNIP produces a list
showing how six national groups _ conservative, liberal, business,
labor, environmental and defense _ rate the caller's senators and
representatives.
   Also provided is a breakdown of how much money the lawmakers
have been given by political action committees representing
agriculture, business, the health industry, labor and professional,
ideological and political groups.
   ``The manual is directed to the person who is frustrated out
there,'' CNIP President Richard Kimball said in an interview last
week. ``We figure we're going to have five minutes of their
attention.''
   The pamphlet is CNIP's first project. The organization, based in
Tucson, Ariz., and supported largely by foundations, is nonprofit
and bipartisan.
   Former Sens. William Proxmire, D-Wis., and Barry Goldwater,
R-Ariz., are among the founders; former Presidents Jimmy Carter and
Gerald Ford are honorary co-founders.
   Kimball ran unsuccessfully in 1986 against Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz.
   He says he feels embarrassed to confess that he spent much of
his time raising money ``so I could put out a commercial showing
myself feeding carrots to horses.'' Campaign advisers had told him
voters would feel kindly toward a candidate seen as a horse-lover
and projecting an ``Arizona image.''
   ``That is dangerous stuff in a democracy,'' Kimball now says.
   So he set out to find a way to educate voters on ways to combat
modern campaign technologies. CNIP resulted.
   The manual advises on methods to cut through campaign posturing,
get information, analyze commercials, sift emotional appeals,
measure ``the ratio of meat to mush.''
   ``You must remember that elected officials are nothing more than
temporary hired help,'' it says. ``View their campaigns as job
applications. Ask if the candidates are giving you, the employer,
the information you need in order to hire wisely.''
   Callers get one copy. Another is sent to a library in their
state.
   Kimball's concern is deadly serious.
   ``Throughout the world,'' he writes in the pamphlet, ``people
struggle in the streets for a small measure of democracy, while
here, in the nation of its birth, it has begun to die.''

<HEAD>`It's Scary Out Here' First Night in Desert</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sergeant is halfway done with digging
his first foxhole on his first night in the Arabian desert when
word comes to pull back.
   He swings his shovel in protest until the reason, transmitted by
whisper, makes its way down the line: the platoon is out of
position.
   ``We're too far out in front of the rest of the company,'' the
sergeant says. ``They could be firing and killing us.''
   The shovels are put away, rucksacks are quickly packed and the
platoon within minutes makes a short retreat, guided to a new site
by a dim fluorescent signal flashed by a sister platoon several
hundred yards away.
   Platoon 22 _ the second platoon of the 82nd Airborne Division's
2nd Brigade _ digs in again.
   A few minutes later, the company commander explains to a
reporter that the platoon had taken position far enough out front
to be hit by friendly mortar and machine gun fire. The captain
isn't happy, but shrugs it off.
   ``He's our newest platoon leader,'' he said. ``It's good to get
him out here to practice.''
   Friday night's exercises gave the troops a chance to practice on
the first night the Saudi government allowed American troops to
train long after sundown. More such drills, including some joint
exercises with Saudi troops, are planned.
   The first night of desert training, witnessed by two reporters
and a photographer, demonstrated the formidable challenges American
forces would face in a desert war in the Middle East. And it
provided journalists the first chance to spend extended time with
some of the young men who would fight that war.
   They are a diverse group from throughout America _ some eager to
fight, some terrified by the prospect. But all share a similar hope
that the crisis will soon be resolved, either through combat or
diplomacy.
   ``We're here sweating because our lives may depend on it,'' said
one private who carried a 50-pound pack through 95-degree evening
heat. ``But it's really not up to us. Our lives are in the
politicians' hands.''
   The sun was just beginning its descent when the three platoons
began the exercise, walking in a V-shaped formation roughly three
miles into the seemingly endless Arabian desert. As the sun dropped
off the horizon, a herd of camels traipsed past the curious
Americans.
   The need to carry more water makes the soldiers' packs extra
heavy. During a break, a 20-year-old medic from Newburgh, N.Y.,
lightens his pack a bit by taking a few gulps. The infantrymen he
is there to help drop into a circular perimeter, their weapons
aimed across the darkening terrain.
   ``Finding the courage is tough _ it's scary out here,'' the
medic says. ``But you've got to swallow that and go out and do it.''
   Inside his bag are needles with antidotes to certain chemical
weapons; the medic prays they will not be needed.
   ``We just want to go back to the states and be with our kids,''
he says.
   None of a dozen soldiers interviewed under the sparkling desert
sky has any idea when the trip home will be. Some ask aloud whether
they will make it. Most hope diplomacy convinces Iraq to leave
Kuwait; a few would rather take on Saddam Hussein's forces now.
   ``If it would get us home faster, then let's go kick him out of
Kuwait,'' one private says. ``What we have now is hurry up and
wait. It's frustrating.''
   It is so dark that one can move around virtually unnoticed; so
quiet that whispers can be heard. Much of the talk is idle chatter.
   ``The sky is just like the sky back home,'' one soldier says to
his companion in a two-man foxhole.
   The response: ``But it just isn't the same unless I'm sitting
out on my back porch.''
   A few yards away, another soldier tells a passerby: ``My wife is
having our baby in five weeks. I wish I could just say hello.''
   A radioman with the medic begins a sentence saying, ``If Saddam
doesn't pull out of Kuwait ....'' The medic completes the thought,
``... he'll be squished like a grape.''
   The men are barely in their foxholes when they are instructed to
head back to their transport trucks, a nearly three-mile walk in
the pitch black night.
   Those in the back of the line can see the shadows of just the
few men ahead. In training, one sergeant says, soldiers have been
known to stop, thinking a tree several feet ahead in the darkness
is the man they are supposed to follow.
   ``That cuts you off from the front,'' he says. ``And if you get
cut off, you die.''
   The Saudi desert has no trees, but the going is treacherous in
the dark because of short, sharp shrubs underfoot and small dunes
that turn a walk to a stumble.
   During the trek, most of the soldiers say they understand that
they must be here and are ready to fight to defend the Saudi
kingdom. These are the troops _ airborne paratroopers _ who arrived
first, when there was little firepower to back them up.
   ``When they called us out, we thought we were going to drop
right into a war,'' the medic says.
   Helicopters on night flights pass in the distance, a reminder
that much more U.S. firepower is in the region now.
   As they wait, the 82nd Airborne forces train about 12 hours a
day. They have some complaints _ the lack of mail is the biggest _
but say morale is high. They complain largely because there is
little else to do.
   ``It's Army tradition,'' one sergeant says with a laugh. ``But
we're fine.''
   A reporter keeps asking what it would be like to fight in the
desert. The soldiers keep asking what it's like back home.
   ``Please tell them we'll be back,'' a lieutenant says. ``We just
don't know when.''

<HEAD>Minister: U.N. Considering Military Action To Enforce Sanctions
Against Iraq</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said
Saturday the United Nations is considering joining in military
action to enforce its sanctions against Iraq.
   Prince Saud al-Faisal also ruled out a diplomatic solution to
the Persian Gulf crisis unless Iraq withdraws its troops from
Kuwait and reinstates the emir, who was deposed in the Aug. 2
invasion.
   ``We are hoping _ ardently hoping _ that military action will be
avoided,'' Saud said in an interview with Western and Saudi
journalists.
   But he added: ``Unless the two principals are accepted by Iraq,
I don't see any prospects for a diplomatic solution.''
   ``That is the only way it can be resolved. There is absolutely
no other way,'' he added.
   The reporters were invited by the Saudi government to travel to
this Red Sea city about 1,000 miles from where thousands of U.S.
troops and other members of a multinational force are deploying on
the Persian Gulf.
   Saud said his country supports actions by the United Nations to
strengthen its economic boycott of Iraq.
   The United Nations has endorsed a total boycott of Iraq, and the
United States and Britain have moved to enforce those sanctions
using naval forces to stop ships believed to be carrying goods to
or from Iraq.
   Saud indicated the action could soon involve a multinational
force under the auspices of the U.N.
   ``The United Nations now is in consultation to see if some
action, more than the boycott, is required and we support that
action and we hope it will be a further signal to Iraq to respond
to the international community's conviction that they have to
withdraw from Kuwait,'' he said.
   Asked what kind of action, Saud said: ``They are considering
military action.'' '' A Saudi official explained that Saud was
referring to possible military enforcement of a blockade.
   Saud, who just returned from Washington and was expected to meet
with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney this weekend, refused to discuss
any specific Saudi conditions under which the United States has
agreed to send more than 50,000 troops to the desert kingdom.
   He said foreign troops arrived at Saudi Arabia's request and
added that the oil-rich kingdom is willing to help pay for the cost
of the deployment.
   ``Saudi Arabia will, as it does, contribute its share for the
defense of Saudi Arabia,'' he said.
   Saud added that the U.S. forces, along with contingents from
Egypt, Britain and other countries arrived ``at the request of
Saudi Arabia and they will leave at the request of Saudi Arabia.''
   The number of troops in Saudi Arabia ``by no means comes close
to the number of troops in Iraq,'' he added.
   Saud said Iraq has between 120,000 and 160,000 men in Kuwait and
has mobilized one million people.
   Saud would not say how long he expected American troops to
remain in Saudi Arabia, but said it is up to Iraq to move to end
the crisis.
   ``The ball is in their court,'' he said.

   Elliott Minor, the AP's Albany, Ga.,
correspondent, recently spent a week in the California desert as
part of his annual National Guard obligation. Here is his report.

<DATELINE>FORT IRWIN, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the temperature approaching 120
and a harsh sun beating down, some weary Georgia guardsmen shuffled
to the rear of an Army truck in the Mojave Desert for a ration of
lasagna and beans.
   Nearby, a dozen M-1 tanks tossed up clouds of choking dust as
they raced across the desert floor. In the shade of a tan Bradley
Fighting Vehicle, medics pumped an IV solution into a grimacing
guardsman and began treating him for a scorpion sting.
   Nearly 1,400 members of the Georgia Army National Guard's 48th
Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) spent three weeks in the California
desert last month, defending the imaginary country of Mojavia
against invaders with black berets.
   The 48th serves as a backup for the 24th Infantry Division
(Mechanized) at Fort Stewart, Ga., which is deploying troops and
equipment to the Saudi Arabian desert to defend the oil kingdom
against a possible Iraqi attack.
   I spent a week in the desert interviewing and photographing the
part-time soldiers as a staff sergeant in the guard's 124th Public
Affairs Detachment.
   At the same time, my 23-year-old son, Emory, was halfway around
the world, training in a Middle East desert with combat engineers.
That mission was halted after Saddam Hussein's troops invaded
Kuwait.
   Despite a regimen of pushups, situps and six-mile runs, I found
it difficult to walk very far in the desert heat with a 70-pound
rucksack, a Kevlar helmet, a gas mask, two canteens, a first-aid
pouch and two ammo pouches stuffed with plastic bags containing
powdered milk and Slim-Fast, a concession to my own battle of the
bulge.
   The importance of water, shade and portable toilets quickly
became apparent.
   We drank water constantly to avoid dehydration. Many guardsmen
carried insulated water bottles and larger containers were placed
in key locations and lashed to nearly all vehicles.
   I drank about a quart of water every hour and never passed up an
opportunity to top off my canteens.
   The desert heat was oppressive, but a constant breeze was
blowing, and we were fairly comfortable in the shade. We were
surrounded from horizon to horizon by sand and rocky peaks. Small
creosote bushes dotted the landscape.
   I saw a coyote ambling across the desert one morning, but no
other wildlife. I shook my boots each morning for scorpions.
   Pfc. Dawn Doyle, an operating room technician with a Macon
medical unit, had some definite plans for her return.
   ``I'll spend three hours in the shower and then sleep for about
24 hours,'' she said. ``Then I'll think about going out for a
pizza.''
   The medics stayed busy treating the guard members for heat
exhaustion, cuts and kidney stones. Georgians are susceptible to
kidney stones because of high calcium levels in their water.
Doctors said dehydration and possibly the rough ride across the
desert triggered dozens of painful kidney stone attacks.
   A common greeting in the Mojave was, ``Hey, I passed my stone.''
   The Army placed portable toilets in the Mojave for the
convenience of soldiers and to protect the desert environment. The
portable johns had the word ``Leroy'' stenciled on the door.
   When one got crushed by a tank, someone put up a sign that said,
``Who killed Leroy?''
   The guard members were issued sunscreen and goggles to protect
their eyes from the sand and sun. They had to keep their sleeves
rolled down to avoid sunburn.
   Unaware of the sleeve policy, I kept mine rolled up for half a
day and wound up with arms as red as boiled lobsters.
   I also lost my goggles and my eyes became irritated while riding
in a truck with no windshield. I eventually had to go to an aid
station to have them flushed out and treated.
   During lulls, the medics, nurses and doctors catnapped in the
shade of truck. When patients arrived, they examined them on canvas
litters set up beneath a camouflage net.
   Everyone wore sensors that sound an alarm when hit by a laser
beam. The sensors also were attached to vehicles. The soldiers'
M-16 rifles and cannons fired blanks for a realistic sound, but
also shot safe laser beams that triggered the sensors.
   ``Dead'' and ``wounded'' soldiers had to sit in a ``bone yard''
for up to 12 hours and their units had to send replacements and
fill out war casualty forms.
   During the 48th's desert sojourn, its members traveled through
such places as Port-A-Potty Pass, John Wayne Pass, the Valley of
Death, Coyote Canyon and Dead Man's Pass.
   During the exercise, we dined on T-rations, which are packed in
large metal containers that are heated before serving, or ``MRE's''
_ Meals, Ready to Eat _ which come in brown plastic pouches and
contain not only food and a plastic spoon but accessories such as
instant coffee, salt, sugar, chewing gum and toilet paper.
   One day, I hitched a ride with members of the 848th Engineer
company from Douglas, a small farming town in south Georgia. They
were camped at the foot of a small mountain.
   The engineers let me use a cot and we all went to sleep beneath
a clear sky studded with millions of stars.
   The next day, they packed their gear into tan trailers and
trucks and disappeared in a cloud of dust. As he bumped along in
the heat, Staff Sgt. Roy Butler was overcome by the Mojave's beauty
and vastness and began to sing an old Baptist hymn.
   ``We need a savior. In times like this, we need an anchor,'' he
intoned.

   Thousands of Korean Christians wearing
white robes were baptized Saturday in a ceremony officiated by
hundreds of Korean and foreign pastors as part of the 16th Baptist
World Congress.
   The ceremony, at the Olympic Regatta Arena in eastern Seoul,
drew about 5,000 Koreans and 1,000 foreign spectators.
   Thousands of Christians lined the arena's embankment and were
led into the water by about 500 Korean and foreign pastors for the
baptism.
   The ceremony culminated a six-day congress that was attended by
about 10,000 Baptist church leaders, including 156 delegates from
the Soviet Union.
   On Monday, 2,000 Koreans were baptized.
   The congress was sponsored by the Baptist World Alliance, which
claims 36 million followers in 145 countries.

<HEAD>Soviet Soldiers Get Windfall in West German Marks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>POTSDAM, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 370,000 Red Army soldiers in
East Germany have few military duties these days, so they spend a
lot of time deciding what to buy with the windfall West Germany
just handed them.
   Like East Germans, the Soviet troopers were allowed to trade
savings in East German marks for West German money when the
currencies merged July 1. Since then, they have been paid in West
German marks.
   Several recruits walking along a road outside Potsdam on a hot
summer day spoke with a Western reporter about their new wealth,
and their plans for it.
   Dmitri wants a tape deck, Valery prefers a video recorder and
Alexei has his mind set on a car. Vladimir said he bought his niece
``really good'' gifts.
   ``Things are better for us now because we have West German marks
and there are many things to buy,'' said Dmitri, a 20-year-old
sergeant from the Ukraine.
   East Germany pays the cost of keeping Soviet troops in this
former cornerstone of the Warsaw Pact. The only difference now is
that the money is paid in West German marks instead of the
now-defunct East mark.
   A Red Army private gets only the equivalent of $15 a month. A
sergeant earns twice that and officers' pay starts at about $625, a
fortune in Soviet terms.
   At the black market rate in the Soviet Union, even a private's
pay is worth about 154 rubles, more than half the average Soviet
monthly wage of 250 rubles.
   In Potsdam, however, it doesn't buy many $2.50 plates of herring
washed down with 60-cent colas, and the first flush of spending has
passed.
   ``They are buying a lot less now,'' said Clark Brutler, who
sells socks in the outdoor market. ``They just don't have as much
money anymore.''
   Many have their eyes on luxury electronic goods or cars, but
even used cars are far beyond the means of low-ranking soldiers.
   Some have sold weapons to raise cash for high-priced items.
   So far this year, West Berlin police have confiscated 90 rifles,
pistols and revolvers; 135 pounds of explosives; 165 grenades, and
four grenade launchers. They said most were of Soviet origin.
   Among the places weapons were seized was a park in East Germany
just outside West Berlin, where police said Soviet soldiers were
selling arms to West Berliners.
   Soviet military hats, coats and badges are peddled to tourists
at the Brandenburg Gate and the former U.S. Checkpoint Charlie
along the Berlin Wall.
   The Soviet military dismisses reports that ordinary soldiers can
barely survive on their pay.
   ``Soldiers get everything _ medicine, free cigarettes _ taken
care of by the Soviet state,'' said Major Karen Streltschemnya, a
political officer at the Soviet mission in East Berlin. ``Deutsche
marks are for snacks, not to live on.''
   Soviet officers can afford to eat well in their villas on their
wooded base, surrounded by a high white wall. Their wives return
from shopping trips with heaping baskets of West German hams,
cheeses and other delicacies.
   Most of the thousands of Soviet soldiers assigned to Potsdam
live in barracks that wind along a two-lane road leading west from
the city. Their lives are relatively spartan, but probably better
than they can expect as civilians back home, where unemployment is
growing and housing is scarce.
   Several Red Army soldiers have deserted their units and gone to
West Germany, whose liberal asylum laws may apply to them.
   Red Star, the Soviet military newspaper, declared recently that
fleeing to West Germany was ``desertion with all its resulting
consequences.''
   Asylum ``is an issue each one of us thinks about, but it is up
to each soldier to make his own decision,'' said Oleg, a Ukrainian
private.
   Potsdam has not experienced the kind of antagonism toward Soviet
troops seen elsewhere in East Germany since that country's
Stalinist government collapsed in November.
   In many communities, signs like ``Russen Raus'' (Russians Out)
are common. Renate Kern, who has lived next to Soviet military
personnel for 22 years, said: ``They are the best neighbors. We've
never had any trouble. They stay for a few years and then go home.''

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Saturday appointed the
Vatican's first envoy to Romania in 40 years.
   The Rev. John Bukovsky was named apostolic nuncio in Bucharest,
a move made possible after diplomatic relations were re-established
between the Holy See and Romania three months ago.
   The pope elevated Bukovsky, 66, to the rank of archbishop.
   Bukovsky was born in Czechoslovakia and traveled to the United
States in 1947 to study theology at the Divine Word Seminary in
Techny, Ill.
   He was ordained a priest in 1950 and spent two years studying at
Catholic University in Washington, D.C.
   Bukovsky also spent several years in the 1950s and 1960s
teaching at the seminary in Techny. He has held Vatican posts since
1973 and in recent years he has worked at the Vatican's Secretariat
of State.
   Romania's former hard-line Communist regime broke relations with
the Vatican in 1950. The Communists were overthrown in December.
   Earlier this year, the pope appointed 12 bishops to restore the
church to its previous strength.

<HEAD>Westerners' Fate Uncertain; Arabs Flee by Thousands</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 9 grafs to UPDATE with today's statement on
foreigners, Britain summoning Iraqi ambassador. Pick up 8th graf
pvs, `In Paris...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Tension mounted today over the fate of Westerners trapped in
Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, and a record number of Arabs fled
into Jordan.
   Today, Iraq warned that foreign nationals would be among the
first to feel the pinch as the international embargo created
shortages of critical supplies. Iraq imports about three-quarters
of its food.
   In a televised statement, Iraq called military enforcement of
the international embargo against it an ``act of war'' and demanded
an end to it. European and American diplomats expressed anxiety in
the wake of Friday's announcement from Iraq that foreigners from
``aggressive nations'' would be kept in Iraq as long as the threat
of war persisted.
   By midday today, an official at the Jordanian border post of
Ruweishid said 4,000 foreigners had crossed from Iraq, and
thousands more were lined up. A day earlier, a record 22,300
foreigners had crossed, he said. Nearly all were Arabs, the
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Friday's Iraqi threat against the foreign nationals was
delivered by Iraq's parliamentary speaker, Sadi Mahdi Saleh. He
said the foreigners not allowed to leave Iraq would be housed in
civilian and military institutions around Iraq.
   ``The people of Iraq have decided to play host to the citizens
of these aggressive nations as long as Iraq remains threatened with
an aggressive war,'' he added. The statement, carried by the
official Iraqi news agency, was monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus.
   Britain today called threats against foreigners by the Iraqis
``unlawful and inhuman.''
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said the Iraqi ambassador
had been summoned to the Foreign Office ``to underline our grave
concern and to relay to his authorities the need for immediate
clarification.''
   In Paris, France summoned the Iraqi ambassador to warn that
``serious consequences'' would result if steps are not taken to
protect the 560 French nationals in Iraq and Kuwait.
   A Foreign Ministry source said it was not whether French
nationals would fall under the Iraqi directive concerning citizens
of ``aggressive'' nations.
   No orders have been given for French people in Kuwait to
assemble at hotels, as were given on Thursday for American and
British nationals, the source said.
   The French Foreign Ministry said that about 290 French citizens
are being held in Iraq and another 270 in Kuwait. Today was the
third time in two weeks the Iraqi ambassador to Paris has been
summoned to the Foreign Ministry to discuss their fate.
   Italian newspapers reported today that more than 300 Italians
trapped in Iraq say they are being held against their will and have
appealed for help from the Italian government.
   In a telex sent via the Italian Embassy in Baghdad, the Italians
described their situation as ``grave'' and asked the government to
help get them out.
   ``We are blocked in Iraq against our will, help us return to
Italy,'' newspapers quoted the telex as saying.
   Italy's Foreign Ministry said it was doing all it could to work
for the release of Italian citizens and was turning to the United
Nations and the Red Cross for help.
   On Friday, the United Nations Security Council expressed concern
about the fate of the trapped foreigners and asked
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to take steps to help
them.
   The White House was silent about Iraq's threat on Friday, and
President Bush refused to answer reporters' questions this morning.
But the State Department has consistently expressed concern about
the Americans.
   Fear mounted again Friday after 35 U.S. citizens were removed
from the Rashid Hotel in Baghdad and taken to an undisclosed
location, most likely another hotel. White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said: ``We consider it a matter of serious concern.''
   Iraq's ambassador to the United States, Mohamed Al-Mashat, said
on Friday that approximately 3,000 Americans in Iraq and Kuwait
would not be harmed.
   Meanwhile, the exodus by Arab nationals from Iraq swelled to its
highest levels yet.
   The Jordanian border official at Ruweishid said Friday's
crossing of 22,300 was the biggest in a single day since the exodus
began, prompted by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The border official said those who crossed today were Arab
nationals, mainly Egyptian, except for two Indians with British
passports.
   A group of 225 Soviet citizens from Kuwait were among the
thousands who crossed into Jordan late Friday. The group was driven
from the border to Amman's airport and boarded a plane for Moscow
early today.
   The crush at Ruweishid is so great that there are not enough
buses to transport the evacuees across Jordan on the way to their
countries. Associated Press photographer Martin Cleaver, in
Ruweishid, said hundreds of trucks had been commandeered to help in
the evacuation.
   The continuing influx of Egyptians into Jordan indicated that
they were not considered by the Iraqis as being citizens of an
``aggressive'' nation, even though Egypt has sent troops to help
defend Saudi Arabia against any Iraqi attack.
   The official at Ruweishid said out of 4,000 Arabs who crossed
today, 3,300 were Egyptians. He said another 7,000 Egyptians had
crossed the previous day.
   The Egyptians are moving south to port of Aqaba after crossing
the border. Thousands are reported to be waiting there for ferries
to carry them home across the Red Sea.
   Many other foreigners, Arabs and a handful of Westerners, were
escaping via the Saudi border. On Friday, thirteen carloads of
American and other refugees made a dramatic escape from Kuwait
through the desert, a Californian member of the convoy said.
   ``It was a hectic, rather perilous drive past Iraqi checkpoints
and through uninhabited desert regions between Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia,'' Stephanie McGehee, 37, said after the group made it over
the border Friday.
   The total number of people in the 13-car convoy was not
immediately clear, although the nine people in Ms. McGehee's car
included two other Americans, a Canadian, a Briton and four
Indians, she said.

   Baghdad today condemned the U.S. economic blockade on Iraq as an
act of war and said that the thousands of foreigners it holds will
suffer along with Iraqis as shortages of food and medicine develop.
   Iraq, which imports three-fourths of its food, said Iraqi and
foreign babies and elderly people will be the first to feel the
effect as the nation makes sure that its food goes to its hundreds
of thousands of soldiers first.
   The Baghdad government holds 3,000 Americans, 4,000 Britons and
about 14,000 other Westerners among the more than 2 million
foreigners caught in Iraq and Kuwait when Iraq's President, Saddam
Hussein, invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   There was no indication in today's statement that the foreigners
would be allowed to leave Iraq or Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. Instead,
it focused on how the foreigners would face deprivation if the
embargo is maintained.
   Iraq has raised the stakes in the Persian Gulf crisis by saying
it will hold captive Americans as a shield, and by diverting troops
pulled back from the Iranian frontier to focus on its confrontation
with U.S. and Arab forces.
   Iraq's army newspaper today reiterated earlier threats to use
weapons of ``mass destruction'' against any attacker. Iraq's
arsenal is known to include chemical weapons and long-range
missiles.
   The United States today planned to step up its mobilization
against the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait by calling up military
reservists and ordering U.S. civilian airlines to help fly troops
and cargo to Saudi Arabia.
   Today's statement on Iraqi television was made by Iraq's
Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. It suggested that some of the
European nationals were already feeling the effects of the
near-total cutoff of supplies.
   ``Because of the embargo, food cannot be secured for aged
persons in the manner that we wish,'' the statement said. ``This
experience has already affected the British people particularly.''
   There are children among the foreigners, and Iraq suggested they
would be treated the same as Iraqi children in shortages.
   ``If there were to be any reduction in the necessities of
babies, then the same calamity affecting the Iraqi newborn will
affect similarly the foreign babies,'' said an Iraqi statement.
   It said the United States and its allies have surpassed the
U.N.-mandated sanctions against Iraq by enforcing a ``military
embargo, including food and medicine, and that is considered an act
of war.''
   The statement was read by an unidentified announcer and
translated by Cable News Network and The Associated Press.
   In Egypt, Suez Canal personnel picked up radio signals
indicating that an American warship in the Mediterranean Sea was
checking the itineraries of commercial vessels approaching or
leaving Egypt's Port Said, at the canal's northern entrance, a
canal official said on condition of anonymity.
   The report came a day after U.S. Navy commanders operating under
new orders to intercept ships to or from Iraq stopped two Iraqi
vessels off the coast of Bahrain. The ships were allowed to proceed
after U.S. forces determined they carried no goods and they were
not boarded, the Pentagon said.
   Washington also joined with the four other permanent members of
the U.N. Security Council in an unprecedented meeting to discuss an
expanded U.N. military role to stop any further advance by Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, who sent forces into Kuwait 16 days ago
in a dispute over oil, land and money.
   The U.S. move to interdict ships has drawn criticism, the latest
coming from Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. The official Libyan news
agency JANA said Gadhafi wrote to the U.N. secretary-general to
protest the move as illegal.
   In Jiddah, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Prince Saud
al-Faisal, said today he saw no prospects for a diplomatic solution
unless Iraq withdraws its troops from Kuwait and reinstates the
emir who was deposed in the invasion.
   ``That is the only way it can be resolved. There is absolutely
no other way,'' Prince Saud said in an interview with Western and
Saudi journalists.
   On Friday, the speaker of Iraq's Parliament said Iraq would hold
all foreigners from ``aggressive nations'' until the threat of war
against his country ends. He said they would be spread throughout
the country, housed in military and civilian targets.
   The White House refused comment Friday on Baghdad's
announcement, and President Bush refused to answer reporters'
questions this morning. Before Friday's announcement from Iraq,
Bush said Iraqi attempts to move American civilians around Iraq and
Kuwait violated international law.
   In an editorial the Iraqi army daily, al-Qaddasiyah, said ``all
weapons at Baghdad's disposal,'' including those of ``mass
destruction,'' would be ``awaiting anyone who is thinking of
aggression and turn him into fragments.''Iraq used chemical weapons
during its war with Iran.
   Iran said today it freed 1,000 Iraqi prisoners of war,
reciprocating for an Iraqi move a day earlier. The Baghdad
government this week made peace overtures to Iran with an eye
toward switching troops from the Iranian border to occupied Kuwait
and the Saudi border. It began withdrawing some of the 300,000
Iraqi soldiers there Friday.
   The Al-Qaddasiyah editorial also said today the 30 divisions
facing Iran _ an estimated 300,000 troops _ would now be used to
bolster Iraqi formations in the south. It was the first word from
an official publication that Baghdad would redeploy forces freed
from the Iranian border.
   Iran and Iraq fought a bloody war from 1980 to 1988. But peace
talks have foundered since then, and this week's initiative by Iraq
is aimed at reaching a permanent settlement.

   Persian Gulf crisis erupted with Iraq's takeover of Kuwait.
   As in 1973 and in 1979, the United States faces rising oil
prices. And though there's no immediate prospect of those kinds of
shortages, they could come eventually. The earlier oil shocks were
major factors in triggering recessions. The economy already is
slowing, and the current turmoil in the Persian Gulf can only make
it worse.
   Despite what happened before, and despite the virtual certainty
that something similar would happen again, U.S. efforts at energy
discipline were shelved for most of a decade. Ronald Reagan's
energy policy was to leave it alone, and let the market rule. That
sufficed while Middle East oil was plentiful and relatively cheap.
Now the problem is back.
   ``We have spent the last decade basking in the glow of falling
real energy prices,'' Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., said before
the Senate passed its energy policy bill early this month. ``We
have been lulled into a complacency that cannot last.''
   During the Reagan administration, the Department of Energy's
conservation budget was slashed by two-thirds.
   When imported oil prices fell in 1986, U.S. production fell,
too. At those prices, many domestic producers couldn't compete, and
there was no incentive to keep going. U.S. oil production is down
by about 20 percent since 1985. At 7.1 million barrels a day, June
production was the lowest on record.
   Remnants of the emergency programs that grew out of the crises
of the 1970s have put the United States in better shape to deal
with the impact of the Persian Gulf situation.
   One of those legacies is the emergency petroleum reserve, a big
enough stockpile to temporarily cushion against shortages. It could
be a lot bigger if the government hadn't stopped buying during five
of the Reagan years, a budget-cutting move that could prove
expensive.
   The 1987 tanker war in the Persian Gulf threatened oil supplies,
and U.S. warships were sent to protect the supply lines. That
costly operation isn't calculated into the price of oil, nor is
this one. They go onto the tax bill, not the price at the pump.
   Sen. Frank H. Murkowski, R-Alaska, calculated that counting the
cost of earlier military operations, the true price of imported oil
comes to $52 a barrel. That hypothetical price tag doesn't include
the cost of the massive U.S. military buildup in Saudi Arabia and
the Persian Gulf.
   Figured that way, the price is soaring with the U.S. military
deployment in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf. ``This is not a freebie
out there in terms of the expenditure,'' President Bush said
Tuesday, saying he could not estimate the cost or the duration of
the operation.
   But people don't count those costs the way they count the cost
of a gallon of gasoline.
   Oil imports are a major factor in the U.S. trade deficit. James
Schlesinger, a former secretary of energy and of defense, says the
price will hit $75 billion next year, swelling to over $100 billion
a year by the mid-1990s if past trends continue.
   Through it all, U.S. energy policy has shifted and drifted.
Richard M. Nixon's Project Independence made little headway toward
the goal in its name. Jimmy Carter said the quest to curb energy
dependence was the moral equivalent of war. His program of
conservation and production incentives, fees, taxes and penalties
didn't last long. The Reagan administration relied on the
marketplace. The Bush administration still is at work on its energy
strategy, due later this year.
   And as Carter notes, the Arab oil suppliers know only too well
that ``we now have no effective national energy policy, nor any
commitment to adopt one.''
   Legislation to declare that oil imports of 50 percent represent
a ``peril point'' for U.S. security, and to require emergency
action to keep them lower is part of a new National Energy Security
Act passed by the Senate just before its August recess, two days
after Iraq invaded Kuwait. The timing was coincidental; the bill
was drafted primarily to deal with global warming, not oil wars.
   A measure seeking to restrain oil imports was defeated by the
Senate in 1987 after the last Persian Gulf crisis had subsided.
   Conservation, production incentives, and new technologies to
develop alternative energy sources all have been components in the
successive strategies that were shaped and shelved after the
earlier oil shocks.
   The Department of Energy put together a quick-hit package of
steps to boost production and promote conservation, to offset the
loss of imports from Kuwait and Iraq.
   But between oil crises, the tendency has been to act as though
there wouldn't be another one.

   An earthquake measuring 5.4 on the
Richter scale shook northeastern Iran Saturday, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   There were no immediate reports of casualties or destruction,
said the report, monitored in Cyprus.
   The quake was felt in two northeastern cities, Gorgan and
Bojnourd, which are about 120 miles apart.
   Gorgan lies 240 miles northeast of the capital, Tehran, near the
Caspian Sea. Bojnourd is 211 miles northwest of the provincial
center of Mashhad in Khorasan province.
   Scores of sharp aftershocks have rolled through Iran since the
June 21 earthquake that destroyed a large swath of northwestern
Iran, killing almost 40,000 people and wounded tens of thousands.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an
earthquake, measured by a seismograph as ground motion. An
earthquake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage, while one
of 6 can cause severe damage.
   The June quake in Iran registered above 7.3.

   A testy President Bush, brushing off
reporters' questions, said Saturday that he no longer will discuss
``serious matters'' like the Persian Gulf crisis while playing golf.
   The president displayed clear misgivings about the image he was
projecting by juggling his annual end-of-August vacation with a
massive U.S. military build-up against Iraq in the Middle East.
   Bush cut off reporters' inquiries on the first tee as he set out
on an early morning round of golf.
   Asked if he had been in touch with the White House situation
room, the president snapped, ``I talk to them every morning at 5:30
and I'm not going to take any more comments up here, though.''
   ``Let's go,'' said Bush to his golf partners, including son
George W. Bush, who chided reporters for talking during his back
swing.
   Bush's ire may have been sparked by footage shown on television
networks of some lighthearted remarks the president made on the
golf course Friday. Asked then if he had signed rules of engagement
for U.S. naval forces in the gulf, Bush quipped, ``I haven't done
anything yet. I just got up.''
   He then sped off in his golf cart.
   When he finished Saturday's speedy round on the Cape Arundel
Golf Course, a reporter asked the president if he was still ``mad''
at the media.
   ``I've never been mad at you. I just don't like taking questions
on serious matters on my vacation,'' he said.
   ``It's just not a good thing to keep doing it like this. But
I'll try to be available,'' said Bush, who has held two formal news
conferences and two informal ones since he came to Maine Aug. 10 on
a 25-day vacation.
   One of those news conferences was at the White House when the
president returned to Washington for a Pentagon briefing on the
gulf crisis. He is also returning to Washington Sunday night for a
meeting Monday with Energy Secretary James Watkins to discuss the
impact on U.S. energy reserves and to address the Veterans of
Foreign War convention in Baltimore.
   ``I think we've been readily available to the press, probably
more so than most, and I'll try to continue that,'' said Bush.
   ``But it just doesn't seem appropriate and so I hope you'll
understand if I, when I'm recreating, will recreate, and then when
we're working, which I'm trying to do up here also, I'll work
hard,'' the president said.
   Bush regularly has answered reporters' questions from the first
tees during his golf outings. A media pool of about 15 reporters,
photographers and broadcast crews travels in his motorcade and is
escorted out to watch his performance at the first tee, the ninth
green and 10th tee, and the 18th hole.
   When reporters persisted in asking questions Saturday, Bush's
eldest son rose to his father's defense.
   ``Hey, hey! Sir! Could you wait until we finish hitting at
least? My game is really bad. But when you're talking in the back
swing, it gets even worse,'' said Bush, a part-owner of the Texas
Rangers.

   An unprecedented Pentagon move to press
civilian aircraft into service for the military buildup in the
Middle East should not disrupt commercial air traffic, a federal
transportation official said.
   However, some airlines' representatives expressed uncertainty on
the effects of the decision, announced Friday.
   Although there have been charters, this is the first time part
of the U.S. civil air fleet has been diverted under a plan
conceived in the 1950s.
   The planes are owned by 16 airlines, which also will be
providing the crews to operate them. The airlift support is
expected to be needed for several weeks, the Pentagon said.
   Air Force Gen. Hansford T. Johnson, commander of the U.S.
Transportation Command and Military Airlift Command, announced
Friday that he would activate the first stage of the Civilian
Reserve Air Fleet to meet the ``growing airlift requirements'' for
U.S. forces.
   His decision enables the call-up of as many as 38 aircraft to
carry soldiers and cargo to the Persian Gulf region.
   Stages two and three, if activated, could deploy as many as 300
commercial planes for military use. The aircraft would come from
passenger and cargo airlines.
   Stage one is not expected to disrupt civilian air traffic, said
Elaine L. Chao, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Transportation.
   Chao and Johnson were in St. Louis to attend a transportation
meeting.
   Johnson said activation of the Civilian Reserve Air Fleet was
necessary because an insufficient number of commercial airplanes
had been volunteered for the Middle East effort.
   The armed forces have been using as many as 24 civilian planes
daily _ 10 volunteers and 14 that were previously under government
contract, Johnson said.
   Bob Gibbons, director of media relations for Eagan, Minn.-based
Northwest Airlines, said Saturday: ``We've been asked to provide
airplanes, and we will.''
   He acknowledged that the decision ``takes our airplanes out of
circulation,'' but added, ``We'll do our best to provide our
scheduled service.''
   Pam Blase, a spokeswoman for Trans World Airlines, said she did
not know how TWA might be affected by the new call.
   ``I can only comment that it is a military matter, and it's not
appropriate for us to comment at this time,'' she said Friday.
   United Airlines is one of the largest participants in the U.S.
fleet program, with 62 planes committed, company spokesman Rob
Doughty said.
   He could not confirm whether United had been called on to
provide any planes for the stage one call-up, but added: ``We do
not anticipate disruptions to our schedule.''
   T. Allan McArtor, a senior vice president for Federal Express
Corp., said his company had the largest fleet participating in the
Civil Reserve Air Fleet, but he would give no specific numbers.
   Federal Express planes flew passenger and cargo missions this
week for the Middle East operation, dubbed Operation Desert Shield.
   ``It was a limited number. It did not disrupt normal service at
all,'' said McArtor, who served as administrator of the Federal
Aviation Administration from 1987 to 1989.
   The company uses only pilots and crew members who wish to go.
``Naturally, there's an element of risk,'' he said. ``We don't feel
it poses risk that can't be managed well.''
   McArtor said the armed forces and the private transportation
sector had ``a successful partnership, but there's a need for
continued improvement.''
   ``The military can't expect companies so highly integrated and
complex to respond on short notice indefinitely. Naturally, we
respond to a national emergency, but we need to plan together,'' he
said.
   Transportation Command coordinates all transportation of
soldiers and equipment for military operations. A branch of the
Transportation Command, the Military Airlift Command, handles
passenger and cargo airlift. Scott Air Force Base near Belleville
is the headquarters for both commands.
   The transportation meeting _ which focused on cooperation
between the military and private industry _ was scheduled months
ago. With the Middle East trouble, ``the timing and the topic could
not be more relevant,'' Chao said.
   ``Our global responsibilities are too great and too diversified
to depend on the military alone,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Iraq said today the economic embargo
against it is ``an act of war'' and that foreign nationals it holds
will suffer along with Iraqis if shortages of food and medicine
develop.
   Iraq imports about three-quarters of its food.
   The Baghdad government holds 3,000 Americans, 4,000 Britons and
about 14,000 other Westerners among the more than 2 million
foreigners caught in Iraq and Kuwait when Saddam sent forces into
the small oil state on Aug. 2.
   There was no indication in today's statement, carried on Iraqi
television, that the foreigners would be allowed to leave Iraq or
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. Instead, it focused on how the foreigners
would face deprivation if the embargo is maintained.
   Food supplies in Iraq will be distributed to the military on a
priority basis because they are ``the shield of the nation,'' the
statement said.
   The Iraqis suggested that foreigners whose countries had
experienced wars would understand the Iraqi decision to reserve
needed supplies for its military.
   ``The peoples of Europe, in particular the British, have gone
through such an experience, or something resembling it, before,''
the statement said.
   Children and the elderly among the foreign nationals would feel
the effects of shortages along with their Iraqi counterparts, it
said.
   ``Because of the embargo, food cannot be secured for aged
persons in the manner that we wish,'' the statement said. ``If
there were to be any reduction in the necessities of babies, then
the same calamity affecting the Iraqi newborn will affect similarly
the foreign babies.''
   Iraq demanded an immediate end to the embargo, which was
approved by the United Nations Security Council in the wake of the
invasion. It also accused the United States of being largely
responsible for the sanctions.
   ``The right solution is for the embargo to end which the United
States deliberately imposed on the Iraqis,'' it said. President
Bush has authorized the interdiction of shipments to Iraq, a move
that has drawn criticism from some other nations.
   ``The military embargo, including food and medicine, is
considered an act of war in accordance with international custom
and international law,'' the statement said.
   Iraq blamed the United States and its allies for the crisis in
the Persian Gulf.
   ``Iraq did not attack the West,'' it said. ``Iraq is a peaceful
nation.''
   Today's statement came one day after the speaker of Iraq's
Parliament said Iraq would hold all foreigners from ``aggressive
nations'' until the threat of war against his country ends. He said
they would be spread throughout the country, housed in military and
civilian targets.
   The Iraqi parliament speaker, Sadi Mahdi Saleh, said Friday the
foreigners would be held as long as the threat of war persists. A
multinational force of thousands of troops, spearheaded by the
United States, has been deployed in Saudi Arabia to defend it
against possible Iraqi attack.
   ``The people of Iraq have decided to play host to the citizens
of these aggressive nations as long as Iraq remains threatened with
an aggressive war,'' the Iraqi official said then.
   Friday's Iraqi statement drew a strong response today from
France and Britain. France summoned Iraq's ambassador to warn of
``serious consequences'' if French citizens were not protected, and
Britain denounced threats against foreign nationals as ``completely
unacceptable.''
   Also, the United Nations Security Council expressed concern
about foreign nationals in Iraq and Kuwait, and asked
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on Friday to take action
to help them.
   The White House kept silent about Baghdad's announcement
regarding the foreigners on Friday, and this morning, President
Bush refused to answer reporters' questions about the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   Before Friday's Iraqi announcement, however, Bush had said Iraqi
attempts to move American civilians around Iraq and Kuwait violated
international law.
   Fears for the safety of Americans was heightened after 35 U.S.
citizens were removed from the Rashid Hotel in Baghdad and taken to
an undisclosed location, most likely another hotel. White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Friday: ``We consider it a matter
of serious concern.''

   The White House said today that
Iraq's holding American and other foreign citizens is ``totally
unacceptable.'' The administration decried the use of ``innocent
civilians as pawns'' in Saddam Hussein's stand against
international sanctions.
   President Bush called on Iraq to immediately reconsider its
refusal to let the foreigners, including an estimated 3,000
Americans, leave.
   The White House, in a statement by press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater, also said it was ``deeply concerned'' by today's
announcement from Baghdad that the Iraqi government may withhold
food from the foreigners.
   Fitzwater said Iraq's announcement that it would not allow
citizens from ``aggressive nations'' to leave is ``totally
unacceptable.''
   He said Bush ``is deeply troubled by the indication that Iraqi
authorities intend to relocate these individuals within Iraq
against their will.''
   ``The use of innocent civilians as pawns to promote what Iraq
sees to be its self-interest is contrary to international law and
indeed to all accepted norms of international conduct,'' the
spokesman said.
   Fitzwater said, ``We urge that Iraq immediately reconsider its
refusal to allow any foreign national desiring to leave to do so
without delay or condition.''
   He said Iraq should ``take note of (Friday's) statement by the
(United Nations) Security Council president expressing the
council's concern and anxiety over the situation of foreign nations
in Iraq and Kuwait, and calling upon the secretary general to take
all appropriate steps.''
   Fitzwater did not specify what action the United States was
prepared to take if the Iraqis do not reverse course.
   But he added, ``The United States intends to consult with other
governments, with citizens being held in Iraq and Kuwait, to
determine what additional measures ought to be taken.''
   Bush will return to Washington earlier than planned Sunday to
meet with his national security advisers over dinner, the White
House said. He is returning to the White House for the night and
will meet with Energy Secretary James Watkins Monday morning to
review the impact of the crisis on U.S. oil reserves.
   The vacation White House issued Fitzwater's statement shortly
after a spokesman for Saddam Hussein appeared on Baghdad television
calling the U.N. economic embargo ``an act of war'' and warning
that foreign nationals it holds will suffer along with Iraqis if
shortages of food and medicine develop.
   Fitzwater said Deputy National Security Adviser Robert Gates
called Bush on his speedboat Fidelity at 11:30 a.m. EDT to discuss
the Iraqi statement and the administration's response.
   The actions came as Bush is readying a call-up of U.S. military
reserves and the Pentagon launched an unprecedented diversion of
civilian aircraft to bolster the U.S. military presence in the
Middle East.
   Bush, teeing off at golf before 7 a.m. today, refused to answer
reporters' questions about the gulf crisis. Asked if he had been in
touch with the White House situation room, Bush replied crisply,
``I talk to them every morning at 5:30 and I'm not going to take
any more comments up here.''
   Although Bush has decided to use reservists to fill in the ranks
of military doctors, cargo handlers and other specialists, he is
still weighing how many are needed to meet the Persian Gulf crisis,
White House officials said.
   An Army source today said the Pentagon's recommendation to call
up reserves did not include a specific number, but that as many as
80,000 armed services reservists and National Guardsmen could be
activated.
   The 80,000 figure is ``a tentative upper limit planning
figure,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The
source said the actual number of reserves called up ``surely will
be less than that.''
   The source said also that the Army has not received the go-ahead
from the White House to begin any activation of reserves, but that
if the order came today, the first group of reservists could be
processed for action within 24 hours.
   Bush has the authority to activate up to 200,000 reservists for
90 days, with the option of keeping them on active duty for another
90 days.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney refused to give a timetable for
the U.S. commitment, saying en route to Saudi Arabia, ``Where we'll
be a year or two from now, I wouldn't want to speculate.''
   It is Cheney's second trip to Saudi Arabia since Iraqi forces
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   In the tense gulf region, Navy commanders stopped two Iraqi
vessels Friday, but let them proceed after U.S. forces determined
they were not carrying supplies for Iraq, an economic pariah since
the occupation of Kuwait. The ships were not boarded.
   The United States is acting under criticism from United Nations
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. He said Thursday that
this country's naval barricade to enforce U.N. economic sanctions
against Iraq was undertaken without the authority of the U.N.
Security Council
   ``We believe it's fully authorized,'' White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater countered Friday.
   In another announcement, the Pentagon on Friday said up to 38
commercial airliners were being turned over to the military to haul
troops and cargo. Although there have been charters, this is the
first time part of the U.S. civil air fleet has been diverted under
a plan conceived in the 1950s.
   The decision was made by the commander-in-chief of the U.S.
Transportation Command and Military Airlift Command, Gen. H.T.
Johnson, to meet the ``growing airlift requirements'' for U.S.
forces deployed in the Middle East, a Defense Department statement
said.
   The planes are owned by 16 airlines, which also will be
providing the crews to operate them.
   The airlift support is expected to be needed for several weeks,
the Pentagon said.
   Fresh concerns were raised about the safety of Americans after
35 U.S. citizens were removed from the Rashid Hotel in Baghdad and
taken to an undisclosed location, most likely another hotel.
   American diplomats in Baghdad believe the Americans may have
been taken to the Melia Monsour, a hotel where British citizens are
also quartered. But Iraqi authorities prevented the embassy
officials from entering the hotel to check, State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher said in Washington.
   Bush also plans to address the Veterans of Foreign War
convention in Baltimore Monday and make a campaign trip to Rhode
Island before returning to Kennebunkport.

   Authorities have decided a broken back is
punishment enough and decided against filing charges against a man
who parachuted from an unfinished high-rise.
   John Carta, a 44-year-old former Green Beret whose hobby is
parachuting from skyscrapers and bridges, fractured his back in
three places when his parachute failed Thursday.
   He was originally cited for trespassing, but the Alameda County
district attorney's office decided not pursue charges in light of
his injuries, Sgt. Jay Crawford said Friday. Carta was listed in
stable condition after undergoing surgery for his injuries.
   His parachute only partly opened when he jumped from the top of
the 27-floor American President Cos. building, which will be the
city's tallest once it's finished.
   The daredevil previously has parachuted onto the 110-story World
Trade Center in New York City from a low-flying airplane. In 1986,
he and another man jumped from an unfinished 500-foot high-rise in
San Francisco; they claimed it was the record for a parachute jump
from the lowest point.

   Here is the text of White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater's statement Saturday on Iraq's refusal
to let foreigners leave the country:
   ``On several occasions since the Iraqi invasion and subsequent
occupation of Kuwait, the president has stated publicly his
interest in the well-being of American citizens and all foreign
nationals in both Iraq and Kuwait. The president thus views
yesterday's statement by the Speaker of Iraq's National Assembly
that Iraq will `play host to the citizens of these aggressive
nations as long as Iraq remains threatened with an aggressive war'
to be totally unacceptable.
   ``He is deeply troubled by the indication that Iraqi authorities

announcement by the government of Iraq that foreign nationals may
not have access to adequate quantities of food. The use of innocent
civilians as pawns to promote what Iraq sees to be its

   ``We urge that Iraq immediately reconsider its refusal to allow
any foreign national desiring to leave to do so without delay or

<HEAD>World's Largest Wooden Ship Makes Rare Trip Through Great Lakes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANTHONY SHADID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The H.M.S. Rose, the world's largest sailing
wooden ship, is trolling through the Great Lakes as it marks its
longest journey since being restored in a Connecticut harbor five
years ago.
   The 18th-century British warship replica, a 500-ton wonder with
masts reaching 150 feet into the air, docked in Chicago earlier
this month and is touring several Wisconsin ports along Lake
Michigan before returning to Connecticut in late September.
   In all the ship will cover 5,000 miles, far fewer than its
namesake traveled when it crossed the Atlantic to attack rebel
colonies during the Revolutionary War.
   ``It has been a very huge success at the ports that it's been
in,'' said Ron Sonntag, spokesman for the Milwaukee-based Festival
Events Inc., which arranged the tour. ``It's a huge spectacle.
People don't have any idea how big it is until they get next to
it.''
   The vessel measures 179 feet long and 14 stories tall.
   Hundreds of Midwesterners flocked on Friday to watch the ship as
it sailed into the harbor at Racine, Wis. The spectators were
rewarded with a full 24-cannon salute.
   ``It's very impressive. . . . It's something I never thought I'd
get the chance to see. I'm bringing the children so they can see
it. I don't want them to miss a wonderful vision of the past, said
Susan Penn, 40, of Highland Park, Ill., who traveled north to
Racine to see the ship.
   The H.M.S. Rose left the Bridgeport, Conn., harbor June 20,
sailing up the Atlantic Coast to the St. Lawrence Seaway. Its stops
have included Cleveland, Detroit, and Chicago; it arrives in
Milwaukee, its last stop, Aug. 27.
   ``The history of the Rose is incredible. We have the distinction
of having the largest wooden vessel that is operational in the
world,'' said its owner, Kaye Williams, of Bridgeport, Conn.
   The replica was built in 1970, incorporating a cannon and the
keel salvaged from the wreck of the original H.M.S. Rose, built in
1757 as the British Navy's main warship. The British had scuttled
the ship in the Savannah, Ga., harbor at the end of the
Revolutionary War to avoid capture by the French.
   But the replica was allowed to decay. Williams bought it for
$70,000 in 1985 and spent $1.3 million to restore it as part of his
development of a marina and restaurant.
   Festival Events Inc. paid $250,000 to bring the ship to
Milwaukee for the fourth annual Maritime Festival, scheduled Aug.
30 through Sept. 3. Organizers expect 600 visitors to tour the ship
every hour as part of the 200,000 people expected at the event.
   The H.M.S. Rose and its crew of 28 are expected to return to
Bridgeport Sept. 20.
   Williams said he hopes to take the ship to Puerto Rico in 1992
and then to the Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, the same year.
   Such long trips are rare for wooden vessels in modern times, but
Williams is confident there's no better duty for his ship.
   ``She had to go to sea. The quote that comes to mind is `only
men and ships rot at the dock,''' Williams said. ``A vessel will
come back in better shape than when she left.''

   The Vatican said Saturday it would consider
proposals for new scientific tests on the shroud of Turin to
determine whether the linen is Jesus' burial cloth.
   The announcement by Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro cast doubt
on earlier test results indicating the shroud was only about 700
years old.
   Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero, archbishop of Turin and
custodian of the shroud, said in 1988 that carbon-14 tests by U.S.,
Swiss and British laboratories showed the cloth dated to between
1260 and 1390.
   He said then that the tests were 95 percent accurate and he saw
no reason for the church to dispute the results.
   But on Saturday, Navarro described the 1988 results as
``strange'' and said they conflicted with previous tests which
indicated the cloth could date back 2,000 years.
   ``In the future, as in the past, the church will take into
consideration all serious and competent operative proposals'' for
tests on the shroud, Navarro said.
   He said the church would attach no conditions to any new tests,
other than that they should not damage the shroud.
   Navarro said the shroud raises questions ``far beyond''
scientific and technical findings, adding that it remains a mystery
how the cloth came to bear the image of what appears to be a
whipped and crucified man.
   Navarro announced that Pope John Paul II had named Monsignor
Giovanni Saldarini as new custodian of the shroud. Saldarini
succeeded Ballestrero, who retired last year, as archbishop of
Turin.
   Navarro said Ballestrero had acted with ``prudence and
impartiality'' and had fostered ``a tradition of open, rigorous and
objective research.''
   For centuries, the shroud has been revered by some as Jesus'
actual burial cloth, although the church has never claimed it was a
holy relic. Others have described it as a clever forgery.
   The shroud measures 14 feet, 3 inches long and 3 feet, 7 inches
wide. It bears a faint image of the front and back of a man with a
thorn mark on the head, lacerations from flogging on the back and
bruises on the shoulders _ suggestive of accounts of Jesus'
crucifixion.
   Despite the 1988 findings, Ballestrero and other church
officials disputed claims that the results proved the shroud was a
fraud, fake or forgery _ words indicating the cloth was meant to
deceive people. They said the shroud remains a venerated object and
powerful symbol of faith.
   For years church officials refused to let scientists study the
cloth. Pope John Paul II in 1986 gave approval for testing.
   The laboratories involved were the University of Arizona, Oxford
University and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology at the
University of Zurich.

   Thousands of Iraqi troops withdrew
Saturday from occupied Iranian territory, and Baghdad said those
forces would be redeployed in the escalating confrontation with the
United States.
   Iran sent home 1,000 Iraqi prisoners of war as a sign of its
confidence that Baghdad's repatration of POWs, which began Friday,
will continue.
   The troop withdrawal and prisoner exchange followed an offer by
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Wednesday to bring a formal end
to the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. A cease-fire halted the fighting
two years ago.
   Iraqi troops, flying white flags, began pulling out of Iranian
border areas Friday night. Iraqi forces had already pulled out of
more than half the occupied areas in the southern Shalamcheh and
Kushk regions, Iran's Islamic republic News Agency said Saturday.
   Saddam has said the pullout will take five days.
   Iran says Iraq occupies more than 773 square miles of its
territories. But the United Nations says the size of the occupied
area is half of that.
   The Iraqi army daily newspaper al-Qaddasiyah declared in an
editorial Saturday that the 30 divisions which have been facing
Iran would now be used to bolster Iraqi formations in the south.
   That was the first official Iraqi word that Baghdad will
redeploy forces freed from the Iranian border in Kuwait, occupied
by Iraq on Aug. 2.
   The forces ``which are leaving Iran's borders ... and the high
readiness of our air force will be an additional might to what we
had already prepared against the aggressive forces,'' the daily
said.
   It was not known how many of the 30 Iraqi divisions _ more than
200,000 troops _ would be moved to Kuwait. The Iraqis have about 10
divisions in to the occupied emirate and have more than 120,000
troops massed on the border with Saudi Arabia.
   Iranian newspapers ran huge headlines Saturday welcoming the
prisoners, some of whom were captured soon after the outbreak of
war in September 1980.
   The Farsi-languge Jomhuri Eslami called their return ``a major
victory for Iran.''
   The site of the prisoner exchanges, Qasr-e-Shirin, a sleepy,
dusty town inside the Iranian border, was decked with flowers,
flags, and colored ribbons.
   At Tehran's Mehrabad airport, a 10-year-old girl named Nahid
waited anxiously for the arrival of her father. She knew him only
from a framed photograph on the mantel and from her mother's
stories.
   In a message to the International Committee of the Red Cross,
Iranian Red Crescent head Vaheed Dastjerdi urged that the prisoner
repatriation be boosted to 5,000 a day ``with regard to the
sensitive and dangerous conditions in the Persian Gulf.''
   The Red Crescent said it could handle that many. But the
International Committee of the Red Cross has said that for now, it
can only handle daily 1,000 mandatory interviews to make sure the
prisoners want to go home. It said it hoped to increase that number.
   The Red Cross has registered about 19,000 Iranian POWs in Iraq
and about 50,000 Iraqis in Iran. But the United Nations estimates
that both sides actually hold more than 100,000.

   Magellan sent information to Earth today
to help engineers learn why they temporarily lost contact with the
spacecraft after its first pictures displayed quake faults,
volcanic cinder cones and plains made of lava flows on Venus.
   ``After steady contact with the spacecraft was re-established
Friday night, engineers commanded the spacecraft to transmit all of
the information in its computer memories back to Earth. This will
continue throughout the weekend,'' said Mary Beth Murrill,
spokeswoman for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   She said it might take days to figure out why Magellan lost
contact with Earth on Thursday night after it sent back its first
test pictures of Venus _ images that had scientists marveling.
   ``The radar works far better than we ever dreamed it would,''
said Steve Saunders, Magellan's chief scientist. ``The kind of
faulting we see would certainly mean there are `Venusquakes.'''
   The pictures will be released Tuesday, the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration said in a statement issued Friday night.
   Before the problem developed, Magellan was scheduled to start
its formal mapping mission Aug. 29, using its radar to peer through
Venus' thick clouds. Murrill said a delay is likely, but engineers
haven't yet announced their plans.
   Engineers today continued the process of returning Magellan to
normal operation. It lost touch with Earth for almost 15 hours
starting Thursday night, then continued to go in and out of radio
contact over the next eight hours.
   A computer command sent to Magellan on Friday night restored
steady radio contact at 7:11 p.m. PDT.
   ``We jumped up and clapped,'' said Tommy Thompson, Magellan
science operations manager. `It was just like the home team scoring
a touchdown.''
   Thompson said engineers expected to remain in touch with
Magellan except when it swings behind Venus, when it normally is
unable to send or receive signals from Earth. As of today, the two
planets were 147 million miles apart.
   Engineers will spend the coming days diagnosing the cause of the
communications breakdown and deciding how to prevent it from
happening again, Thompson added.
   Magellan was deployed May 4, 1989, from the shuttle Atlantis on
its $744 million mission to make the best maps and pictures yet of
Venus. The spaceship went into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10 after
a looping 948-million-mile voyage.
   Less detailed radar pictures of Venus from other U.S. and Soviet
spacecraft and from a radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico,
revealed signs of faults on Venus and also found tens of thousands
of volcanoes, although scientists still don't know if any are
active.
   Magellan's first pictures showed in much better detail regions
that intensely faulted, and also ``clear indications a lot of
plains are (old) lava flows'' fractured by younger faults, Saunders
said.
   ``What we're seeing is some of the lava flows that came out of
large volcanoes, but we haven't seen any large volcanoes yet,'' he
added.
   Saunders said volcanic cinder cones in the pictures have craters
on top, and the cones range from three-fifths of a mile to 1 mile
wide. Their height hasn't yet been calculated.
   Magellan must pass over the same area twice to detect landscape
changes that would indicate volcanoes are erupting. It takes 243
Earth days for Venus to spin once beneath the nearly polar-orbiting
Magellan, so it will be at least eight months until Magellan will
be able to look for signs of active volcanoes.
   When Magellan first lost contact with Earth on Thursday night,
its sophisticated computer programs automatically put it into a
protective state of semi-hibernation called a ``safing mode,''
turning its solar panels to the sun to make sure it drew adequate
power, laboratory spokesman Jim Doyle said.
   Magellan automatically entered an even deeper hibernation Friday
morning, shutting down crucial systems to protect them but also
making the spacecraft start rotating as it beamed radio signals
into space.
   That assured some of the signals would reach Earth, but also
meant radio contact was intermittent throughout the day. The
command sent Friday night stopped the rotation and kept Magellan's
secondary antenna pointed toward Earth to maintain contact.
   Communication through the secondary antenna is slower than
through Magellan's main antenna. But the secondary antenna
broadcasts a much broader, cone-shaped radio beam, allowing contact
to be maintained more easily. NASA said controllers will switch
back to the main antenna sometime next week.
   Magellan's radio signals are tracked by 230-foot-wide, dish
antennas at Goldstone, Calif., and in Australia and Spain.

   We made it! We made it! I jumped out of
the car when the Bedouin guide told me we were in Saudi Arabia.
   My companions whooped and hugged each other.
   But most of us were sad for Kuwait, its people and the friends
we left behind.
   My joy could not erase the memories of recent days, starting
with that awful Thursday morning of Aug. 2 when the bomb blasts
shook me out of bed.
   It was actually happening. The Iraqis were invading and their
tanks were rumbling brazenly into Kuwait city.
   I told my Canadian flatmate, Kathy McGregor, that the Iraqis
were there and ran to the roof.
   There was gunfire. The T-72s were rolling through the streets.
The Iraqi soldiers stopped all motorists and pedestrians at
gunpoint.
   They yanked the mobile phones out of cars and threw them away.
They shot at motorists who didn't stop.
   I called the AP with the news, then rushed back to the roof.
   Iraqi army vehicles were heading to the oil area of al-Ahmadi.
Helicopter gunships swooped low over the city. There was no sign of
Kuwaiti troops.
   The Iraqis were shooting indiscriminately. It was frightening.
   At mid-afternoon, the Iraqis shelled the Sief Palace, the
interior ministry and the parliament building. People were scared
and confused. No one knew what to do.
   The shelling shifted later to the residence of the emir, Sheik
Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and the palace of the Crown Prince, Sheik
Saad Abdullah al-Sabah.
   The Iraqis set up headquarters at the nearby Sheraton Hotel
after kicking everyone out. Kathy and I had a sleepless night.
   Aug. 3 _ Iraqi soldiers were on the rampage, looting, raping and
murdering. Some stranded British Airways crewmembers called Kathy.
   They said an Indian flight attendant with British Airways was
raped in a bus at a parking lot by Iraqis who threatened her with
knives.
   They said they saw her running into the SAS Hotel lobby and
asking for a doctor.
   Women panicked. The British Airways crewmen complained to an
Iraqi general. He wanted the Indian girl to identify the rapists
and promised to shoot them on the spot.
   The girl couldn't identify anyone. The general claimed the
rapists were Iranians disguised as Iraqi soldiers.
   Aug. 5 _ The looting intensified. Car showrooms, auto spare part
shops, the Central Bank, jewelry shops, private villas and palaces
were all ransacked.
   The radio, now under Iraqi control, denounced the royal family
and claimed the invaders were saving Kuwait from its corrupt rulers.
   They said they would install a new regime. Kuwaitis wept.
   Aug. 6 _ People were asking about the royal family. Were they
safe? Had the Iraqis murdered them?
   We knew that the emir's cousin, Sheik Fahd al-Ahmed al-Sabah,
was killed by an Iraqi tank shell outside the royal palace, which
he tried to defend with a rifle.
   We were really scared. We left our beloved house and took refuge
at an embassy. I can't say which one for fear the Iraqis might harm
the people who are still there.
   Aug. 7 _ We moved to the SAS Hotel. Iraqi soldiers came and
demanded a list of everyone in the hotel and their nationalities.
The list was taken to an Iraqi major at the Royal Club Suite.
   We decided the hotel was no longer safe. We left. I spoke Arabic
to the Iraqis and they thought I was Arab.
   We hid our passports in our shoes and sought refuge at another
place, which I won't name. We stayed underground for eight very
long, very boring days.
   Aug. 8 _ We started practicing self-defense _ karate, how to
stab with a knife if attacked, how to kick and disable an
adversary. Survival was the keyword.
   Aug. 9 _ We were glued to the radio. Practically cut off from
the world, we wanted to know what was going on in Kuwait.
   We knew the Americans were out to save Kuwait and defend Saudi
Arabia. That was good to know.
   We knew that the U.S. Embassy was telling Americans to pack and
be ready to leave. Was there any chance of evacuating safely? No
one seemed to know.
   Aug. 10 _ (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein pledged to wage a
jihad, or holy war, against America. Oh Saddam, give us a break!
   Radio newscasts reported that most Islamic countries scoffed at
this call.
   The radio said that Saddam claimed the United States didn't have
enough military muscle to confront Iraq and alluded to chemical
weapons as its ultimate means to crush America.
   Kuwait radio, operating clandestinely, came back on the air. It
said Iraqi soldiers were fighting each other and deserting.
   There was more looting. The Iraqis were filling buses, trucks
and cars with stolen radio and television sets, furniture,
chandeliers, everything they could lay their hands on.
   We saw one truck with about 15 washing machines being unloaded
in the basement of a house occupied by Iraqi residents. The gold
souk, or market, was stripped clean.
   Aug. 12 _ Food was scarce. Kuwaiti women were selling jewelry
for cash.
   Rumors were rife about Palestinians aiding the invaders.
Kuwaitis denounced them as a fifth column.
   Aug. 13 _ The Iraqis said all Western embassy personnel should
leave for Baghdad. We were scared. The Iraqis apparently wanted to
keep us hostage.
   Aug. 14 _ I sneaked out for some fresh air. There were signs of
Kuwaiti resistance and hit-and-run attacks.
   The underground was gathering money and food, distributing it to
anyone who needed them.
   Grafitti on the walls reviled Saddam, told him to swallow his
chemical weapons.

   Aug. 15 _ I was seriously thinking of escaping. But we needed a
foolproof plan, a four-wheel drive vehicle, water and food _ plus a
guide to get us across the desert.
   Aug. 16 _ The Iraqis called U.S. nationals to gather at the
International Hotel, the British at the Regency.
   There was no way we were going to just give ourselves up to be
transported to Baghdad.
   A British woman, married to a Kuwaiti, called and offered to
help with an escape.
   We got a Bedouin guide. We contacted a number of friends _ two
Americans, a Briton, a Canadian and four Indians. They agreed to
join us. Pretty soon we had more than 60 people ready to go.
   Aug. 17 _ Lebanese friends filled our jeep with gasoline from
their cars. Kuwaiti friends provided black chador robes and veils
for disguise. Almost everyone put on Arab robes.
   All the cars gathered at 10 a.m. and the great escape was on. We
gave our dog a sleeping pill to keep her quiet and took the asphalt
highway past Iraqi troops.
   We were scared, but the guide reassured us. We were stopped at
one checkpoint and the soldiers told us to go back.
   We drove into the desert. But the Iraqis were there too.
   They stopped us, demanded our identity cards and told us to go
back.
   We turned around, but tried another desert track. We played
hide-and-seek with the Iraqis, dodging around troop camps without
being spotted.
   We saw many cars abandoned by people who had tried to get away.
We never knew what happened to them.
   Tanks were everywhere. We'd get through one sector, then regroup
for the next dash.
   We passed scores of armored vehicles, some abandoned. Our guide
said some Iraqi tank crews had deserted to the Saudis by joining
refugee convoys.
   We thought our luck had run out when we ran right into a tank
formation. But we slipped through.
   We discovered one of the cars was missing. The guide found it
stuck in the sand _ and Iraqi soldiers helping the Kuwaiti
occupants pull it out.
   The guide said two of the Iraqis were generals who apologized to
the Kuwaitis for the invasion.
   We headed off again. After several hours, we hit a solid road.
Our guide turned to me, beaming, and said the most wonderful words
I've ever heard: ``No more dangers. You're now in Saudi Arabia.''

   It was a town looking for appeal and no
monkey business.
   Civic boosters on Thursday bought the makings for 50 banana
plants in a campaign to make this community of 1,100 the ``Banana
City'' in the Cornbelt of America.
   ``This is the beginning of the big banana groves in the central
region of the United States,'' said businessman Gene Brooks Sr.
``The Banana Belt has come to the Republican Valley.''
   The banana belt idea took root about a year ago when Brooks
began running radio ads for his car dealership, attempting to draw
attention by advising listeners to ``Come to Banana City.''
   One person called and asked if he was actually going to grow
bananas.
   ``I said, `We certainly are,''' Brooks said, ``even though the
idea had not occurred to me yet.''
   Brooks researched bananas and ordered the banana ``corms,'' or
starts, from Mexico. The corms, planted in half whiskey barrels,
will grow to 8 feet and could produce edible bananas within a
couple of years.
   The barrels, lined along city sidewalks, will be brought indoors
during the winter.
   Businessman Lowell Harms said it is a positive way to promote
the community. ``The next thing we have to do is find the
monkeys,'' he said.

<HEAD>Radiation Treatments Resume for Republican Chairman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT NAYLOR JR.</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors treating Lee Atwater have resumed
radiation therapy to treat the Republican National Committee
chairman for brain tumor ``progression,'' a spokeswoman said
Saturday.
   However, the spokeswoman, Leslie Goodman, did not respond
directly when asked about reports that physicians treating the
39-year-old South Carolinian had discovered a second brain tumor.
   She replied only that physicians ``were not specific on that.''
   Saturday editions of two South Carolina newspapers quoted
unidentified sources as saying doctors had discovered a new growth.
   But Goodman said doctors stated only ``that there has been tumor
progression and that's about as much as we know and about as far as
they intend to go in their description.''
   She described Atwater's condition as unchanged from Friday.
   ``He's alert, seeing visitors and did undergo radiation
treatment yesterday,'' she added.
   Goodman said the visitors had included family, friends and some
Bush administration officials.
   A statement issued Thursday by the Republican National Committee
had said a biopsy performed on Atwater ``indicated tumor
progression requiring additional treatment.'' The statement said
also that Atwater began receiving radiation treatment Wednesday.
   He was diagnosed March 6 as having a non-malignant tumor on the
right side of his brain.
   The discovery of the second tumor was reported by The State
newspaper in Columbia, S.C., which cited close friends of Atwater,
and The News &amp; Courier of Charleston, which quoted a source close
to the situation.
   Responding to those reports, Goodman said Atwater's doctors
``aren't sure whether it's a new tumor or part of the old tumor.''
   Atwater underwent brain tumor surgery on April 3 and has been in
and out of the hospital repeatedly for treatment of ailments
ranging from a blood clot in his leg to a nagging fever.
   Until this week, however, doctors believed the tumor was
virtually gone.
   A friend described Atwater, who managed President Bush's 1988
campaign, as ``very, very weak.''
   The controversial Atwater was President Bush's 1988 campaign
manager.
   He has described himself as a nuts and bolts politician, but he
enraged Democrats with his hard-ball brand of politics.
   Democrats were especially incensed when Atwater was credited
with effectively injecting black Massachusetts prisoner Willie
Horton, accused of raping a white woman while on furlough, into the
1988 presidential campaign against Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   Because of the Horton matter, Atwater's later efforts to woo
black voters into the Republican fold were hampered.
   Born in Atlanta, Atwater was 9 years old when his parents moved
to Columbia.
   In high school, he gained a passion for music, and even after he
attained national prominence in politics, Atwater often performed
as a rhythm and blues guitarist.

<TEXT>
   The White House denounced Iraq's use
of ``innocent civilians as pawns'' in the Persian Gulf crisis
Saturday as new threats to the safety of Americans posed what one
analyst called ``a tremendous, painful dilemma'' for President Bush.
   Once again, the specter of hostages is forcing an American
president to confront delicate issues of life and death in the
Middle East.
   The 3,000 Americans trapped in Kuwait and Iraq may be an
Achilles Heel in Bush's campaign to force Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to withdraw his invading army from Kuwait and return exiled
leaders to power.
   ``He's (Bush) in a classic bind,'' said Colorado College
political scientist Tom Cronin. ``He's now invested militarily so
much in it that he would look like a weak leader if he backed down
or compromised because of the hostages.''
   Bush was silent Saturday, but was described by aides as ``deeply
troubled'' that Americans and foreigners were being moved against
their will in Iraq. Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said it
was ``totally unacceptable'' that Baghdad said it will hold captive
Americans as a shield as long as their was any threat to Iraq.
   Iraq also warned that all foreigners will suffer if shortages of
food and medicine result from sanctions and the U.S.-led embargo.
The White House said Bush was ``deeply concerned'' by that news.
   ``The use of innocent civilians as pawns to promote what Iraq
sees to be its self-interest is contrary to international law and
indeed to all accepted norms of international conduct,'' Fitzwater
said in a statement.
   ``We urge that Iraq immediately reconsider its refusal to allow
any foreign national desiring to leave, to do so without delay or
condition,'' Fitzwater said.
   Brookings Institution analyst Judith Kipper said Iraq's use of
the foreigners was ``blackmail.'' She said Saddam had created ``a
tremendous, painful dilemma'' for Bush but that the United States
still might have to use force, even if innocent Americans were
killed.
   ``It's not because we're so cold-hearted and mean but because
it's such a major crisis,'' she said. ``If we wait it's not going
to get better, only worse.''
   While confronting Iraq with a massive buildup of American combat
forces, Bush had hoped that Saddam would not use U.S. citizens as
an insurance policy against any U.S. strike or to force a rollback
of sanctions.
   Trying to keep the stakes low, Bush has refused to call the
Americans ``hostages.'' He referred to them last Friday as
``inconvenienced people who want to get out.''
   Hostage situations in the past have embroiled Presidents Carter
and Reagan. Bush inherited an ongoing, six-year hostage situation
in Lebanon.
   Saddam clearly recognizes that captive Americans can be used as
important bargaining chips _ expendable if necessary. His past
practices indicate he clearly plays for keeps.
   Saddam has used chemical weapons against his own citizens and
has repeatedly demonstrated a ruthless disregard for the lives of
innocent civilians. There are fears that Americans and other
foreigners might be positioned around military and industrial
centers in Iraq to deter attack from the United States and its
allies.
   Fitzwater, in his statement, said he hoped Iraq ``would take
note'' of Friday's statement by the U.N. Security Council
expressing concern and anxiety over the plight of foreign nations
in Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``The United States intends to consult with other governments
with citizens being held in Iraq and Kuwait to determine what
additional measures ought to be taken,'' Fitzwater said.
   The White House announced that Bush would break away from his
vacation Sunday earlier than anticipated to return to Washington to
meet over dinner with his national security advisers.
   The president was piloting his high speed boat, ``Fidelity,''
when Iraq declared that the economic embargo against it was an act
of war and warned that Westerners would suffer if Iraqis did.
   Bush was notified of the developments in a ship-to-shore call
from Robert Gates, his deputy national security adviser.

   The warning that foreigners would starve came in a statement
from the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, also carried by INA.
   It singled out the United States for blame in blocking food
supplies, and accused Washington of going beyond the mandatory U.N.
sanctions in denying Iraq food and medicine.
   The United Nations imposed the embargo Aug. 6, four days after
Iraq invaded and occupied Kuwait.
   The United States ``proceeded with applying an economic seige by
military force against Iraq ... and such an act by international
law is known as an act of war,'' said INA.
   It emphasized that the blockade would deny children their milk,
medication and other necessities.
   ``Because the children of the world are beloved of God and of
Saddam Hussein and in compliance with our humanitarian
principles...we have decided to place the children of foreign
families which Iraq has decided to host in equality with the
children of Iraq and...what affects the children of Iraq will
equally effect them,'' said the statement.
   It said adult Westerners will also be affected.
   ``Due to the circumstances of the boycott and economic siege
which have been imposed by the United States by military means food
will not be available for all adults in the amounts we would
wish,'' the statement said.
   The ministry noted that Europeans, especially Britons, will
understand the measures due to their previous experiences.
   It said the food supplies in Iraq would be distributed to the
military and in Iraq's extensive military industries on a priority
basis because they are ``the shield of the nation.''
   The solution to the problem was to end the blockade, said the
statement.
   On Friday, Iraq's parliament speaker said Iraq would ``host''
all foreigners from nations taking what he called an aggressive
stance against Iraq.
   It said they would be released only when the threat of war was
lifted.
   There are two million foreigners in Iraq and Kuwait, which Iraq
annexed after its Aug. 2 invasion. The foreigners include 20,000
Westerners, including about 4,500 Britons and 3,000 Americans the
largest groups.
   The Iraqi government later clarified the statement to say that
the restrictions on leaving the country did not apply to Egyptians.
   Also Saturday, the Iraqi army daily, al-Qaddasiyah, said
``weapons of mass destruction and strategic deterence possessed by
Iraq will be lying in wait to turn those who contemplate committing
aggression into scattered pieces.''

   Will Disneyland's Abe Lincoln be deposed
by Kermit the Frog and the Muppet gang?
   ``Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln,'' which features a robot
replica of the 16th U.S. president, will close at least temporarily
Aug. 26, Disneyland spokesman Bob Roth said Friday.
   Roth would not comment on employee reports that a 3-D movie
featuring the late Jim Henson's Muppet characters will replace
Lincoln. But he did say no reopening date for the 25-year-old
Lincoln attraction had been set.
   ``It's a refurbishing of that whole facility,'' said Roth.
``We'll be announcing our plans.''
   The Lincoln attraction is housed in the Disneyland Opera House,
which also holds exhibits on the park and its founder, Walt Disney.
   Disney himself developed the ``audio-animatronic'' Lincoln,
which premiered at the 1964 New York World's Fair and moved to
Disneyland in 1965. Lincoln stands up from a chair, gestures and
recites excerpts from his speeches.
   Disney ``was extremely proud of creating that figure,'' Roth
said. The Lincoln attraction underwent a $200,000 renovation about
five years ago.
   According to park employees who spoke on condition of anonymity,
the Muppet movie is replacing Lincoln as part of Disneyland's
effort to give a higher profile to Henson's characters.
   Disney officials announced earlier this year that a Muppet stage
show and parade were planned for the park in 1991, while a 3-D
``Muppetvision'' movie and theater was set for 1993.
   Disney last year purchased rights to use the Muppet characters
in its theme parks, movies, teleivison shops and retail products.
   Asked about the chance the Muppet image could swamp the older
Disney characters such as Mickey Mouse, Roth noted that when
changes have been made in the past _ such as teaming with filmmaker
George Lucas to create ``Star Tours'' and ``Captain Eo'' _ there
was criticism.
   ``Every time you do something like that there will be people who
are unhappy, saying that's not how Walt Disney would have done
it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Metal Box Considered Promising Clue in Earhart Search</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WALTON BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A metal box found in the South
Pacific, initially dismissed as junk, may be a promising clue to
the disappearance of pilot Amelia Earhart, say members of an
organization trying to unravel the mystery.
   Ms. Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan vanished without a trace
53 years ago while attempting to make an around-the-world flight.
   Tom Willi and Tom Gannon, both retired military fliers living in
this Florida Panhandle city, used 1930s navigation techniques to
plot Earhart's likely course.
   They persuaded the International Group for Historic Aircraft
Recovery, based in Wilmington, Del., to mount a $250,000 expedition
last year to the Pacific atoll Nikumaroro and nearby McKean Island.
   TIGHAR's 28-member team returned with several items, but the
most intriguing is the aluminum box, now identified as a
navigator's bookcase. The box, about one foot by one foot by 10
inches, was buried in sand on the atoll and discovered with someone
using a metal detector.
   Gannon said Friday that he believes the bookcase came from Ms.
Earhart's plane.
   ``It's more than a promising lead. It's a convincer,'' he told
the Northwest Florida Daily News.
   But TIGHAR's president, Patricia Thrasher, was more cautious.
   ``We aren't ready to say, `This is it, ta-da!,'' she said. ``We
can't do that until we see a photograph of it in the Earhart
airplane or find somebody who says, `Yeah, I installed one for
Noonan.' But we are very excited about it.''
   Researchers have determined the bookcase was manufactured by
Consolidated Aircraft Corp. of San Diego for PBY Catalina flying
boats, used to resupply a Coast Guard navigation and communications
base on now-uninhabited Nikumaroro during World War II.
   However, TIGHAR reported in its August newsletter that wartime
PBYs carried a later-model bookcase and that the one found by the
Earhart expedition had mounting holes and fixtures that ``are all
wrong for installation in a PBY.''
   The researchers have speculated that Noonan could have bought or
borrowed a bookcase from the Navy and modified it for use in Ms.
Earhart's two-engine Lockheed Electra.
   Early versions of the bookcase were available in 1936 and 1937,
Thrasher said. Ms. Earhart and Noonan vanished in July 1937.
   The organization has been unable to find any photographs or
official sketches of the interior of the missing Electra.
   ``The focus for photographers was always Earhart and that meant
the cockpit, not the back of the aircraft where the navigator's
bookcase would've been,'' she said.
   Thrasher said the group plans to return to Nikumaroro in
September 1991 to look for the missing plane with remote underwater
search equipment.
   ``If it's where we think, the airplane is going to be down about
2,000 feet,'' Thrasher said.

   The U.S. Naval
fleet in the Persian Gulf briefly went to battle stations Saturday
after an American frigate fired warning shots across the bow of an
Iraqi tanker, Navy officials said.
   Navy officials told reporters traveling with Defense Sec. Dick
Cheney that the fast frigate USS Reid fired the first shots of a
two-day old interdiction effort ordered by President Bush to halt
commerce to and from Iraq.
   Iraq accused the United States of firing on two Iraqi oil
tankers that had refused to be searched, and said a similar act in
the future would have ``grave consequences.''
   The incident took place as Iraq called the economic embargo
against it an ``act of war'' and said thousands of foreigners it
has prevented from leaving the country will starve along with
Iraqis.
   Baghdad also threatened to use weapons of ``mass destruction''
against attackers.
   Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Chalabi said U.S. warships had fired on
two Iraqi oil tankers: the Baba Karkar in the Persian Gulf and the
Khanaqin in the Gulf of Oman.
   After the USS Reid fired its warning shots, Capt. Morris Foote
of the guided missile cruiser Ticonderoga said ``The Persian Gulf
forces have gone to general quarters,'' They are at battle
stations.'' The alert was lifted some time later.
   The Ticonderoga was in the Red Sea with the Eisenhower battle
group, on the eastern side of the Saudi Arabian peninsula.
   Foote said the incident occured about 4 p.m. Gulf time , 9 a.m.
EDT, south of the narropw entrance to the Persian gujlf in the Gulf
of Omasn.
   Foote did not have details, but other officers told reporters
they believes the Iraqi ship had not stopped when ordered. Foote
said warning shots were fired by the Reid's 76 millimeter gun after
the frigate's commander received permission to do so from Rear Adm.
William Fogarty, the comander of the Middle East task force in the
Persian Gulf.
   ``It was not immediatedly known whether the Iraqi tanker
continued on its way or turned around after the altercation, but
reports reaching the Eisenhower six hours later said the U.S. ships
inthe Persian Gulf were no longer at battle stations.

<HEAD>Inventor of Banned Suicide Device Says He May Use It Again</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The creator of a suicide device who gained
national attention when he used it to help an Alzheimer's disease
patient end her own life said Saturday that he may defy a court ban
and help others die.
   ``If a person is beyond hope, what do I care about any court
injunction?'' Dr. Jack Kevorkian said in a telephone interview from
his Royal Oak apartment, about 15 miles north of Detroit. ``If a
patient is really needing it, I may have to act. If nothing else,
out of human compassion.''
   His statement Saturday appears to reverse what he has maintained
since the injunction June 8 when he said, ``I'm out of business.''
   He said he's talked with two Michigan women who want to die _
one he described only as ``crippled''; the other has an extreme
case of emphysema.
   Kevorkian said he has checked with their doctors on the
diagnoses, and he has met with the family of one of the women.
   He had met with the family of Janet Adkins before deciding to
use his device in his van at a county park on June 4. The machine
and his 1968 Volkswagen van were confiscated after Adkins, 54, of
Portland, Ore., pressed a button that released lethal chemicals
into her system.
   Kevorkian said it would take a few days to build another device
if he decided to use it.
   ``I wouldn't do it just to get arrested. It would be to help a
patient,'' Kevorkian said.
   Kevorkian was in Oakland County Circuit Court on Friday to
respond to a temporary injunction issued after Adkins' death.
   Judge Alice Gilbert had ordered him to stop using the device and
also enjoined the 62-year-old retired pathologist from helping
people use any other means to kill themselves.
   Kevorkian didn't answer the injunction, and Assistant County
Prosecutor Michael Modelski said default papers were filed Friday.
Instead of ruling on a permanent injunction, Gilbert gave Kevorkian
21 days to answer the default ruling.
   Modelski said Saturday that Kevorkian could be in contempt of
court if he uses the machine.
   ``He basically is saying that he's above anybody's rules, and
that's the problem,'' Modelski said. ``It could trigger a possible
second criminal investigation if he uses it again.''
   He said that after the current investigation, if no criminal
charges are filed, ``we're going to have people flying in from all
over to use this machine.''
   Michigan has no specific law against suicide or assisting in it.
The case is under investigation by the county prosecutor, state
police and state medical association.
   Gilbert suggested to Kevorkian that he get a lawyer, but
Kevorkian said he has no intentions of doing that because he said
he hasn't broken any laws.
   ``They're just trying everything to stop me,'' Kevorkian said.
``I dare them to bring charges. Do something. Throw me in jail if
you can.''

Khanaqin in the Gulf of Oman.
   After the USS Reid fired its warning shots, Capt. Morris Foote
of the guided missile cruiser Ticonderoga said ``The Persian Gulf
forces have gone to general quarters,'' They are at battle
stations.'' The alert was lifted some time later.
   The Ticonderoga was in the Red Sea with the Eisenhower battle
group, on the eastern side of the Saudi Arabian peninsula.
   Foote said the incident occured about 4 p.m. Gulf time , 9 a.m.
EDT, south of the narropw entrance to the Persian gujlf in the Gulf
of Omasn.
   Foote did not have details, but other officers told reporters
they believes the Iraqi ship had not stopped when ordered. Foote
said warning shots were fired by the Reid's 76 millimeter gun after
the frigate's commander received permission to do so from Rear Adm.
William Fogarty, the comander of the Middle East task force in the
Persian Gulf.
   ``It was not immediatedly known whether the Iraqi tanker
continued on its way or turned around after the altercation, but
reports reaching the Eisenhower six hours later said the U.S. ships
inthe Persian Gulf were no longer at battle stations.

   Here, at a glance, are the latest developments in the Persian
Gulf crisis:
   
   A U.S. frigate fired warning shots across the bow of an Iraqi
oil tanker in the Gulf of Oman and U.S. forces briefly went to
battle stations over the incident, a Navy official said. Iraq said
two Iraqi oil tankers were fired on after refusing to be searched,
and warned of ``grave consequences'' if case of another such
incident.

   Iraq called the U.S.-enforced economic blockade against it an
act of war, and said thousands of foreigners stranded in Iraq and
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait will starve along with Iraqis if shortages
occur. Baghdad has refused to let 3,000 Americans, 4,000 Britons

   The United States kept pouring thousands of troops into Saudi

   Saudi Arabia said it plans to increase its oil output by up to 2

<DATELINE>YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For merchants in the
gateway communities of Yosemite National Park, business has been no
business at all since fires closed the popular park to tourists.
   Three major fires and dozens of smaller ones in the 725,000-acre
park since Aug. 3 scarred more than 22,000 acres, felled timbers
and destroyed 66 buildings. More than a week ago, the park was
closed to visitors, and most of the park is due to stay closed
until Monday.
   Cool weather washed over much of fire-scarred California by the
weekend as firefighters further tamed the last in a deadly siege of
1,300 blazes. But a National Weather Service expert, Milo
Radulovich, said thunderstorms, which ignited nearly all the fires
by spawning more than 37,000 lightning strikes in less than two
weeks, are likely to recur after the cooling spell ends Monday.
   For those who make their living in communities near Yosemite,
closing the park during the height of the summer tourist season has
taken a financial toll, and its aftermath will probably be felt
through the leaner winter months.
   Hotels and motels were hit hard.
   ``We can't recoup,'' said Joan Gloor, owner of the 37-room
Mariposa Lodge off Highway 140, a major southern gateway to
Yosemite, about 180 miles east of San Francisco.
   The motel was only 18 percent occupied Friday night during a
month in which anything less than completely full is a rarity.
   Summer revenue ``is what we count on. We save up for the worst
months of the year,'' Gloor said. ``It's going to be tough.''
   The 61-room Gold Rush Inn in Mariposa also expected low
occupancy during the weekend.
   ``It's pretty dead,'' said hotel clerk Jill Francis, adding that
the hotel was more than 50 percent booked for Monday, the day the
park's most popular destination, Yosemite Valley, is scheduled to
reopen.
   Some small stores and restaurants in Mariposa County were closed
over the weekend, but merchants that remained open said business
was simply ``OK.''
   Jean De Young, executive director of the Mariposa County Chamber
of Commerce, described the situation as ``just a lot of quiet
chaos.''
   ``Everyone looks to August and early September as being the last
real blast,'' she said. ``But people are canceling reservations as
far away as September.''
   Hotels and motels were busy this weekend contacting people with
reservations and encouraging them to go ahead with Yosemite
vacation plans.
   Though a segment of the park was open, all roads into Yosemite
Valley remained closed this weekend, with the Highway 140 entrance
scheduled to reopen Monday. And the road linking Coulterville, a
historical gold mining town, with Yosemite will be closed until
damaged timber is cleared.
   That made tourism in Coulterville ``almost nonexistent,'' said
Karin Fielding, co-owner of the 20-room Hotel Jeffery.
   ``We get a lot of drop-in traffic, and that's what totally
died,'' she said. ``We think (Coulterville) has a lot of
attractions, but there's no doubt Yosemite is our main draw. ...
The majority of our visitors are headed there.''
   The fire has also affected employees of the park's biggest
concessionaire, Yosemite Park and Curry Co. The company runs the
495-room Yosemite Lodge, the 123-room Ahwane Hotel, several lodging
and tent sites, tour buses, every restaurant and almost every store
in Yosemite National Park.
   Several hundred of the company's 1,500 employees worked during
the fires, said company spokesman John Poimiroo. He didn't expect
layoffs because summer employees are leaving.
   The National Park Service lost an estimated $50,000 in entrance
fees each day the park was closed, said Pat Tolle, fire information
officer for Yosemite Center. The park, however, will not be
directly affected by the loss because those funds go into the
service's general treasury.

<HEAD>Girl In Baby Swap Case Meets Biological Parents and Siblings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kimberly Mays, an 11-year-old at the
center of a two-year baby-swap controversy, has finally met the
couple who proved she was switched with another baby in a maternity
ward, according to a report published Saturday.
   But a relative says the girl is still confused by the legal
tug-of-war and all the attention from a family she never knew.
   Meanwhile, the man who raised the girl has joined the girl's
natural parents in a lawsuit against the hospital where the switch
apparently occurred.
   The long-awaited meeting between the Sarasota girl and her
biological parents, Ernest and Regina Twigg, took place quietly
this spring at a miniature golf course in Sarasota, the St.
Petersburg Times reported Saturday.
   The couple and Robert Mays, who raised Kimberly as his only
daughter, agreed to keep the visit secret to avoid the crush of
reporters and photographers who have followed the high-profile case
through the courts.
   During an initial rendezvous and two subsequent meetings,
Kimberly, an only child in the Mays family, also was introduced to
her seven brothers and sisters in the Twigg family.
   ``Apparently, with the kids it went very good. But when you ask
about the parents, she just puts her hands up in the air and shakes
them,'' said Velma Coker, one of Kimberly's grandmothers.
   ``She's still mixed-up,'' Mrs. Coker told the newspaper.
   Kimberly, born at a tiny rural hospital in Central Florida, went
home with the wrong parents _ Mays and his wife, Barbara, who died
of cancer in 1981.
   Ms. Mays and Ms. Twigg delivered blond-haired girls within a
couple days of each other in late 1978 at Hardee Memorial Hospital
in Wauchula. The Mays baby and the Twigg baby were the only two
white girls born around the same time at the hospital. Both mothers
went home on Dec. 5, 1978.
   It wasn't until genetic tests a decade later that the families
learned they had raised each other's daughter.
   The girl the Twiggs named Arlena and raised as their own died of
a heart defect two years ago, never knowing that doubts about her
parentage had been raised shortly before she died.
   The Twiggs set out to find their natural daughter. The path led
to Sarasota. Mays and the Twiggs feuded in court over genetic
testing and custody rights. Mays won a promise from the Twiggs that
they wouldn't seek custody no matter what the tests showed.
   Genetic testing confirmed last fall that Kimberly was born to
the Twiggs, who now live in Sebring.
   Attempts to reach Mays and the Twiggs for comment were
unsuccessful Saturday; each family has an unlisted number.

   Four soldiers who were to join U.S.
forces in the Persian Gulf were killed Saturday when their pickup
slammed into a toll booth, state police said.
   A fifth soldier was critically injured in the accident at the
Hopkinsville toll plaza on the Pennyrile Parkway, about 15 miles
north of Fort Campbell on the Kentucky-Tennesee line.
   Two toll collectors said the truck was going between 75 and 80
mph when it slammed into the cushion in front of one booth,
according to Trooper Mack Brake. The collector working that booth
had just left his post and was not injured, Brake said.
   Brake said all three men riding in the bed of the truck were
killed, as was the driver. The survivor was riding in the cab.
   Authorities declined to release other details of the 5:15 a.m.
accident.
   The soldiers were part of the 101st Airborne Division, of which
17,000 are being sent to Saudi Arabia, said Bill Harralson,
spokesman at Fort Campbell.
   The names of the five soldiers were being withheld until
relatives were notified, Harralson said.

<HEAD>Saudi Official: Iraqi Troops Making Forays into Saudi Arabia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraqi troops have made forays,
believed to be for reconnaissance, along the Saudi-Iraqi border, a
top Saudi official said Saturday.
   In an intelligence assessment of the Persian Gulf crisis, the
official said the Iraqis are thought to have 170,000 men and 1,000
tanks in Kuwait.
   Because of the flat desert terrain, tanks are easily moved
around the region, he said.
   ``At the moment, all the indications are that they are digging
in,'' the official said of the Iraqi troops. He spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   The Iraqis in Kuwait are remaining at least 25 miles from the
Saudi border and have set up a command center at al-Wafrah in
southern Kuwait.
   Meanwhile, Iraqi forces have been spotted on the Saudi-Iraqi
border near Kuwait, the official said.
   The troops have been few and their forays have been brief, the
official said. He speculated they are reconnaissance missions along
the 520-mile Saudi-Iraqi border.
   The only way to dislodge Iraqi troops from Kuwait at this point
would be to deal ``significant blows,'' both economic and military,
to Saddam Hussain, the official said.
   He said it was impossible to predict how long Saddam could keep
his country fed during the international boycott because there is
no estimate of how much food Iraq has stockpiled.
   Iraq imports more than 70 percent of its food, and the Saudi
official said he knows ``they had orders for foodstuffs which have
not reached Iraq.''
   One shortage that Saddam does not face is military hardware, the
official said. ``They are well stocked, and they have spare parts,
and they have manufacturing capabilities,'' he said.
   At the same time, the official said, the Saudis will work to
encourage the local resistance to Saddam in Kuwait and Iraq.
   In Kuwait, there are reports of people buying tanks from Iraqi
troops to blow them up, the official claimed. He said Kuwaitis are
broadcasting anti-Saddam radio programs into Iraq.
   The official said the Saudis are convinced that if Saddam is
deposed, his government will crumble.
   But Saddam's moves are hard to predict because the Iraqi
president discusses his plans with only a small coterie of advisers.

   Four people apparently climbing on an oil
storage tank were killed when the tank exploded, authorities said
Saturday.
   The victims, including two teen-age sisters, were apparently
climbing a ladder to the top of the tank Friday night when a spark
ignited the explosion, said Lt. Robert Davidson of the DeSoto
Parish Sheriff's Office.
   ``Places like these are gathering places for teens,'' he said.
``At most of these places, the gates are unlocked or broken. They
are a pretty good place to get out of town. Hopefully after this
that will end.''
   The powerful explosion shook house windows in the area and threw
one of the girls 65 feet from the tank, he said.
   The dead were identified as Becky Wall, 16, and Heather Wall,
14, both of Keatchie; David Price, 21, of Logansport; and Tony
Walker, 21, of Flatwood, Texas.
   No one else was injured, Davidson said.
   Authorities hadn't determined the cause of the spark, Davidson
said, but it might have been a cigarette lighter.
   The about 30-foot tank held about 20 gallons of oil, far below
its capacity of several thousand gallons, he said. It was destroyed
and a similar tank nearby was damaged.
   A sheriff's investigator was inspecting he tank site Saturday.
It was not immediately known who owned the tank, which was about
five miles north of this west Louisiana town near the Texas border.

<TEXT>
   Russia's prime minister on Saturday invited exiled
writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn to return home, and Tass reported
that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has restored the citizenship he
stripped from a dissident poet.
   Irina Ratushinskaya, whose stirring poems from the gulag won her
international acclaim and persecution at home, was one of 23 people
who lost their citizenship between 1966-88 and had it restored by
Gorbachev last week, the official news agency said.
   Eleven of the names, including those of Ms. Ratushinskaya and
her dissident husband, Igor Gerashchenko, were first disclosed
Saturday.
   Another was Natalia Solzhenitsyn, the Nobel laureate's wife.
Restoration of Alexander Solzhenitsyn's citizenship was announced
Thursday.
   In a letter published on the front page of Saturday's
Sovietskaya Rossia newspaper, Russian Prime Minister Ivan Silayev
urged Solzhenitsyn to accept his restored citizenship and return
home as Silayev's guest.
   Solzhenitsyn's homecoming was ``one of those moves that are
needed as much as air by our homeland,'' Silayev wrote.
   ``The interests of the state and its future destiny compel me to
ask you and your family to accept an invitation to be my personal
guests at any time you choose.''
   Some of those rehabilitated were stripped of their citizenship
by previous leaders such as Leonid I. Brezhnev, but at least three
of those named Saturday lost theirn citizenship after Gorbachev
came to power in March 1985.
   Ms. Ratushinskaya and Gerashchenko lost their citizenship in
1987 while in London. She had sought medical treatment for heart
trouble and other problems she says she developed in labor camps.
She was released from captivity a few months after Gorbachev took
office.
   Soviet authorities had accused her of spreading ``deceitful
propaganda intended to win the West's trust.''
   Ms. Ratushinskaya has said she would return home only if greater
democratization took hold.
   Another former dissident on the latest list was psychiatrist
Anatoly Koriagin, who spent six years in labor camps. Gorbachev
stripped him of citizenship after he criticized authorities for
using psychiatry as a political weapon.
   Mrs. Solzhenitsyn, whose citizenship was taken away in 1977,
said last week her husband demands that expulsion orders and
treason charges against him be lifted before he would consider
accepting any Soviet citizenship offer.
   Solzhenitsyn, 71, was arrested for treason in February 1974,
forced onto a plane to Germany and stripped of his citizenship. He
lives in Cavendish, Vt., and says he won't return unless all his
books have been published in the Soviet Union and are widely
available.
   His works include ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' about the horrors
of Josef Stalin's prison camps, ``One Day in the Life of Ivan
Denisovich,'' ``Cancer Ward'' and ``August 1914.''
   Others on the latest list of those whose citizenship has been
restored were: Georgy Vins, a former leader of the Soviet Union's
Baptist sect; Raisa Orlova, the late wife of Solzhenitsyn's prison
friend Lev Kopelev; Igor Shelkovsky, a sculptor and journalist;
Mykola Rudenko, a dissident writer and a founder of the Ukrainian
Helsinki Group; I. Shakhnazorova; Mikhail S. Voslensky, who wrote
the book, ``Nomenklatura,'' an inside account of the lives and
structure of the Soviet bureaucracy; I.S. Glagoleva; Yu. Novikov;
and M.H. Rezmetz.
   Those announced Thursday were Solzhenitsyn; chess champion
Victor Korchnoi; writers Vasily Aksyonov, Vladimir Voinovich, Lev
Kopelev, Georgi Valdimov and Valeri Tarsis; scientists Yuri Orlov
and Valeri Chalidze; and artist Oskar Rabin.

   The first Soviets to be evacuated from Kuwait,
mostly oilfield construction workers, arrived home Saturday after a
long trek along desert highways clogged with thousands of other
refugees.
   ``We were not caught in the middle of the fighting, thanks be to
God!'' Maya M. Nagayeva said. She was standing on the tarmac of
Sheremetyevo-1 Airport next to the Aeroflot jumbo jet that flew her
and about 240 other Soviets home from Amman, Jordan, following the
overland journey from Kuwait through Iraq.
   The Soviets said they were well-treated by Iraqi soldiers
following the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, but were happy to be home.
   A few were greeted with hugs, tears and flowers by about two
dozen anxious relatives who had gathered to meet the Ilyushin-86.
   Most aboard the plane were rugged-looking construction workers
from the oilfields in Siberia. They would stop over briefly in
Moscow before returning to their home towns, said Sergei K.
Arakelyan, an official of the Ministry for the Oil and Gas
Construction Industry who formally greeted the workers.
   The Soviets all had lived in Kuwait. They traveled for three
days from the overrun sheikdom: via bus and car to Baghdad in
113-degree temperatures, across Iraq on a highway jammed with other
refugees heading for the Iraqi-Jordanian border, and then on to
Amman for the flight home.
   They said the conquering Iraqi soldiers provided them with an
escort to the Iraq border on the first phase of their evacuation to
Baghdad.
   ``We were welcomed in a friendly way with no problems from the
Iraqi side or the Kuwaiti side,'' said Antonina V. Bluzkina, a
secretary who was given a huge bouquet of flowers by her tearful
daughter.
   Telman Alkataev, senior executive of a construction sector and
head of the group, told Tass news agency that ``none of us was
harmed or humiliated'' by the Iraqi troops. ``Soldiers came to our
apartments many times, but there was not a single case of theft,''
he said.
   Mrs. Nagayeva said the Soviet community in Kuwait was unaware of
the invasion until after Iraq had already occupied the country.
   ``At 8 a.m. (on Aug. 2), we were told that there was a war,''
she said.
   ``We were afraid, worried. Everyone was. But when we learned
that the Soviet government was doing everything to evacuate us, we
calmed down. Now we are just happy to be home.''

   The White House denounced Iraq's use
of ``innocent civilians as pawns'' in the Persian Gulf crisis
Saturday as new threats to the safety of Americans posed what one
analyst called ``a tremendous, painful dilemma'' for President Bush.
   Once again, the specter of hostages is forcing an American
president to confront delicate issues of life and death in the
Middle East.
   The 3,000 Americans trapped in Kuwait and Iraq may be an
Achilles Heel in Bush's campaign to force Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to withdraw his invading army from Kuwait and return exiled
leaders to power.
   ``He's (Bush) in a classic bind,'' said Colorado College
political scientist Tom Cronin. ``He's now invested militarily so
much in it that he would look like a weak leader if he backed down
or compromised because of the hostages.''
   Bush was silent Saturday, but was described by aides as ``deeply
troubled'' that Americans and foreigners were being moved against
their will in Iraq. Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said it
was ``totally unacceptable'' that Baghdad said it will hold captive
Americans as a shield as long as their was any threat to Iraq.
   Iraq also warned that all foreigners will suffer if shortages of
food and medicine result from sanctions and the U.S.-led embargo.
The White House said Bush was ``deeply concerned'' by that news.
   ``The use of innocent civilians as pawns to promote what Iraq
sees to be its self-interest is contrary to international law and
indeed to all accepted norms of international conduct,'' Fitzwater
said in a statement.
   ``We urge that Iraq immediately reconsider its refusal to allow
any foreign national desiring to leave, to do so without delay or
condition,'' Fitzwater said.
   Brookings Institution analyst Judith Kipper said Iraq's use of
the foreigners was ``blackmail.'' She said Saddam had created ``a
tremendous, painful dilemma'' for Bush but that the United States
still might have to use force, even if innocent Americans were
killed.
   ``It's not because we're so cold-hearted and mean but because
it's such a major crisis,'' she said. ``If we wait it's not going
to get better, only worse.''
   While confronting Iraq with a massive buildup of American combat
forces, Bush had hoped that Saddam would not use U.S. citizens as
an insurance policy against any U.S. strike or to force a rollback
of sanctions.
   Trying to keep the stakes low, Bush has refused to call the
Americans ``hostages.'' He referred to them last Friday as
``inconvenienced people who want to get out.''
   Hostage situations in the past have embroiled Presidents Carter
and Reagan. Bush inherited an ongoing, six-year hostage situation
in Lebanon.
   Saddam clearly recognizes that captive Americans can be used as
important bargaining chips _ expendable if necessary. His past
practices indicate he clearly plays for keeps.
   Saddam has used chemical weapons against his own citizens and
has repeatedly demonstrated a ruthless disregard for the lives of
innocent civilians. There are fears that Americans and other
foreigners might be positioned around military and industrial
centers in Iraq to deter attack from the United States and its
allies.
   Fitzwater, in his statement, said he hoped Iraq ``would take
note'' of Friday's statement by the U.N. Security Council
expressing concern and anxiety over the plight of foreign nations
in Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``The United States intends to consult with other governments
with citizens being held in Iraq and Kuwait to determine what
additional measures ought to be taken,'' Fitzwater said.
   The White House announced that Bush would break away from his
vacation Sunday earlier than anticipated to return to Washington to
meet over dinner with his national security advisers.

   Arnold Schwarzenegger, his biceps
bulging amid the corn dog and fried dough vendors at the Illinois
State Fair, declared Illinois the nation's leading example for
physical fitness Saturday.
   The former bodybuilding champion turned Hollywood actor came to
the fairgrounds in the starring role of chairman of the President's
Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.
   He said Illinois was the only state to impose a daily physical
education requirement in its public schools.
   ``Illinois still isn't perfect and I've talked to Gov. (James)
Thompson about that,'' he said after presenting the governor an
award for his work on behalf of physical fitness.
   Schwarzenegger, who had breakfast with the governor at the
Executive Mansion, said many schools may not be following through
on the physical education requirement because of budgetary problems.
   Schwarzenegger was present as honorary race director for the
sixth annual ``Kids Fun Run'' featuring more than 500 kids from
kindergarten through sixth grade in a half-mile run from the fair's
main gate to ``Kid's Corner.''
   ``Remember this is not a race where we just try to win and push
everyone aside,'' he warned the kids as they lined up.
   Adults, with their cameras and videorecorders at the ready,
seemed more interested seeing the international film star than
watching the kids race.
   ``It's the team work of the schools and parents that can save
our children today,'' Schwarzenegger told parents, urging them to
avoid being ``couch potatoes'' and to join their kids instead in
sports and other activities.

   Hank Williams Jr., the often rowdy
country music star, has written a song suggesting that Iraq take
its poison gas and ``stick it in your sassafras.''
   Williams said he wrote the song Thursday after watching
television news reports about the critis in the Middle East.
   ``I was mad,'' he said Friday.
   The song, called ``Don't Give Us a Reason,'' warns Iraq against
pushing the United States to war.
   Williams called his band together, rehearsed the song Friday and
recorded it. The tune could be ready for release in a few days.
   Williams is known for his hit songs like ``All My Rowdy Friends
(Are Coming Over Tonight)'' and ``Born to Boogie.'' He was the
Country Music Association's entertainer of the year in 1987 and
1988.

   A former publicist for boxer Mike Tyson's
ex-wife is suing the former heavyweight champion for sexually
assaulting and threatening to kill her, her attorney said Saturday.
   Phyllis C. Polaner filed the lawsuit Friday in Superior Court,
seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages from Tyson,
his ex-wife, Robin Givens, and Ms. Givens' mother, Ruth Roper,
attorney Howard E. Brechner said.
   The lawsuit accuses Tyson of abusing the three women between
Aug. 28 and Oct. 2, 1988, while Tyson and Ms. Givens were involved
in a divorce case.
   The suit alleges that Ms. Givens and Ms. Roper ``maliciously
failed'' to stop the abuse, which the former publicist says caused
``severe temporary and permanent personal and emotional injuries.''
   Ms. Polaner also claims Tyson sexually assaulted and threatened
to kill her.
   The suit refers to a Sept. 20, 1988 incident in Moscow in which
an angry Tyson chased the three women from their hotel suite and
held them in a glass-enclosed elevator against their will.
   Ms. Polaner contends that on that day, Tyson ``assaulted,
battered, menaced, threatened and detained her against her will.''
   There was no answer Saturday at the office of Tyson's lawyer,
Howard Weitzman of Los Angeles. Howard Weitzman was quoted in
Friday's editions of The Star-Ledger of Newark as saying the
allegations were ``absolutely false.'' He said Ms. Polaner was only
after money from Tyson.

   A well-known author of books on
parapsychology and near-death experiences phenomenon was found
stabbed to death in his home, authorities said Saturday.
   Police found the body of D. Scott Rogo, 40, in his Northridge
home on Thursday after a concerned neighbor called to say Rogo's
backyard sprinkler had been running for two days.
   No arrests have been made and police had no motive for the
killing, Detective Michael Brandt said.
   Rogo's mother, Winifred Rogo of North Hollywood, said she
doubted the murder had anything to do with her son's work.
   ``He investigated strange phenomena, but it wasn't dangerous,''
she said. ``I think it was a prowler, someone off the street.''
   Rogo lived alone and worked from his home. He had written 30
books and conducted investigations into telepathy, clairvoyance and
extrasensory perception.
   Raymond Bayless, a former president of the Southern California
Society for Psychical Research, said Rogo had a good reputation
among experts on the paranormal.
   ``He was top-rank,'' Bayless said. ``This is a tremendous loss
to the field.''
   Rogo's books included ``The Poltergeist Experience,'' ``Beyond
Reality,'' ``Phone Call From the Dead'' and ``NAD: A Study of
Unusual Other-World Experiences.'' The latter was published when
Rogo was a 19-year-old student at California State University,
Northridge.
   He also published articles in Parapsychology Review and the
Journal of the Society for Psychical Research, and had lectured on
the topic at John F. Kennedy University in Orinda, Calif.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's now-disbanded secret police
may have been behind the deaths of several West German businessmen
who dealt with East German firms, a West Berlin newspaper said
Saturday.
   The Berliner Morgenpost said some cases involved West Germans
who managed firms that were fronts for East German operations.
   The paper quoted Karl-Heinz Schlurmann, a former East-West
commerce expert, as saying links existed between the unexplained
deaths of several West German businessmen who had dealings with the
former Communist government.
   The paper cited the case of Hamburg businessman Uwe Harms, who
was found shot to death in his apartment on April 26, 1987.
   It quoted Schlurmann as saying Harms was involved in shipping
weapons from East Germany to Third World countries, balked at the
business and was killed because he knew too much.
   The newspaper also cited the September 1981 death of Karl-Heinz
Noetzel, who it said was chief of an East German cover firm in
Essen, West Germany.
   It said Noetzel was found dead in a Leipzig hotel bathroom,
apparently having suffocated. It quoted Schlurmann as saying a
possible motive for his death may have been corruption.
   It said Noetzel's successor, J.F. Bruns, died on Aug. 20, 1982,
in the East Berlin hotel Metropol after he was suspected of being
an agent for the West.
   It also cited the death in a car accident of trade expert Horst
Busse in March 1972.
   The newspaper report follows recent allegations that the secret
police may have tracked down and killed prominent East German
refugees who fled to the West, and that they also harbored
notorious left-wing terrorists wanted in Western nations.
   Sensational disclosures have been coming out ever since East
Germany threw off its hard-line Communist rulers and elected a
democratic government.

<HEAD>Wilder Budget Cutting Seen As Political Move</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEAN McNAIR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. L. Douglas Wilder's announcement that
he would impose broad spending cuts without raising taxes is seen
as further evidence he plans to run for national office, possibly
as early as 1992.
   ``Anybody who thinks the governor is not looking at 1992, in
spite of what he's said, is extraordinarily naive,'' said Sen.
Dudley J. Emick Jr., a fellow Democrat.
   Wilder, who has received widespread publicity since he became
the nation's first elected black governor in January, has said he
has no plans to seek national office before his term ends in 1994.
   But his cost-cutting plans are seen as a way to contrast his
record with that of President Bush, who is considering a tax
increase to balance the federal budget.
   Wilder thinks if he can ``contrast himself with both George Bush
and with so-called tax-and-spend Democrats, he's well positioned
for a national race,'' said Robert Holsworth, a Virginia
Commonwealth University political analyst.
   ``He's positioned himself for the kind of race he would have to
run whether it's in '92 or '96, that of a fiscal conservative,''
said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist.
   In a statewide televised address Thursday night, Wilder said he
would freeze state employee salaries, slash state agency spending,
eliminate some minor agencies and cut aid to schools to make up a
projected $1.4 billion budget shortfall. He blamed an economic
slump for the expected drop in tax revenues to fund the state's $26
billion, two-year budget.
   The governor said he would propose no new taxes and would
maintain services for the poor and medically needy.
   ``That plays well among the pragmatists of the Democratic
Party,'' Sabato said.
   Holsworth said the speech was Wilder's latest success in
portraying himself as a fiscal conservative while still holding on
to his core black and liberal constituency.
   But he said Wilder may have jeopardized his relationship with
state legislators, some of whom were angry about not being
consulted on the cuts.
   Holsworth also said Wilder could be hurt in the long run by
cutting education funding, which is particularly needed in poor,
rural schools that he has pledged to improve.
   Holsworth likened Wilder to Democrat Jimmy Carter, who launched
himself to the presidency by emphasizing his budget cutting and
social compassion during one term as governor of Georgia.
   Sabato said he saw similarities to Republican Ronald Reagan, who
blamed Carter for the fiscal problems that he inherited in the
early 1980s.
   Sabato said Wilder has taken the same approach by blaming his
Democratic predecessor, Gerald L. Baliles, for leaving behind
fiscal problems. Wilder took his latest dig at the former governor
by saying he would abolish the Department of World Trade that
Baliles created.
   Despite his denial of national ambitions in 1992, Wilder may
have betrayed himself when he announced the revenue shortfall at a
news conference Aug. 1.
   The governor said he wanted to reveal the budget problems to
``the American people'' before quickly correcting himself.

<HEAD>Armed Serbs Set up Roadblocks on Eve of Referendum</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with Croatian presidency saying
tension amounts to armed insurrection, other details; no pickup</NOTE>

<DATELINE>KNIN, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Serbs with shotguns and hunting rifles
sealed roads into southwestern Croatia on Saturday in what the
state presidency said amounted to an armed insurrection.
   The Serbs planned a referendum Sunday on their autonomy within
the republic and set up road blocks to keep police from intefering.
The Croatian government has declared the vote illegal.
   A statement by the Croatian presidency, reported on Croatian
radio, said tensions had ``assumed the form of an armed
insurrection.''
   Both sides appeared to be trying to avoid an armed conflict,
however. Police did not try to move into the region.
   Radio Knin reported earlier after a conversation with local
Serbian leader Milan Babic that contacts were under way with
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and the head of Croatian police
to defuse the dispute.
   Babic appealed over local radio to Serbs manning roadblocks to
let traffic pass.
   On Friday, Yugoslav air force fighters intercepted a flight of
police helicopters before they could reach this region near the
Adriatic coast.
   The increasingly bitter disagreements between Yugoslavia's two
largest ethnic groups threatens to tear the fragile federation
apart.
   ``If the police come try to break through in their armored cars,
we will fry them like chickens in a pan,'' said a Serbian man armed
with a double-barrel shotgun standing guard at a roadblock nine
miles north of Knin. He refused to identify himself.
   Other armed Serbs felled trees and dumped rocks on the main
highway south of the Croatian capital, Zagreb, to seal off the
area. In a village near Knin, some Serbs were seen armed with light
machine guns.
   The roadblocks sealed off resorts on the Adriatic coast, and
left carloads of German and Italian tourists stuck facing armed
village men.
   Serbs, the largest Yugoslav ethnic group, make up 11 percent of
Croatia's 5 million people. Serbs charge Tudjman's new,
reform-minded government with fostering nationalism.
   Tudjman's administration advocates turning the country into a
loose federation of six nearly independent states.
   Serbia's hard-line Communist president, Slobodan Milosevic, and
the Communist-dominated armed forces oppose this and favor greater
centralization and federal control.
   Official Croatian radio said earlier that tensions started to
ebb Saturday.
   It accused the Serbian minority of trying to secede and join the
Serbian republic. Croatian officials fear that would foster
domination of Yugoslavia by the Serbia.
   In its statement issued later, the Croatian presidency asked the
federal government to take measures to prevent ``extreme
nationalists from Serbia'' from coming to Croatia with
reinforcements. It did not elaborate.
   Croatian radio said use of national air force jets to stop the
police helicopters amounted to an effort ``to overthrow the state's
new government . . . and to put a stop to democratic processes in
Yugoslavia.''
   The Croatian presidency called on the federal presidency to
determine ``the responsibility of senior army commanders'' in the
incident.
   The state news agency Tanjug said the Yugoslav army
chief-of-staff informed Croatian Premier Stipe Mesic the army would
not intervene as long as ``there are no casualties.''
   But the statement also said the army's tasks included preventing
``fratricidal war'' and the army would ``perform this task
unconditionally'' according to the constitution and the law.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union plans to start withdrawing
its troops from East Germany ahead of schedule, a West German
newspaper reported Saturday.
   The Hamburg-based newspaper Bild am Sonntag said in an article
released to other news media that the withdrawal of some of the
estimated 370,000 Soviet troops stationed in East Germany could
begin as early as next week.
   The newspaper said the withdrawal of Moscow's largest military
force outside the Soviet Union could be completed by the end of
next year.
   Bild am Sonntag did not identify its sources, and the duty
officer at the Soviet Embassy in East Berlin had no comment.
   A West German Foreign Ministry spokesman in Bonn denied that the
pullout would be completed by the end of 1991.
   The official, Juergen Chrobog, said the timetable would follow
the agreement reached last month by West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. They agreed that
the withdrawal would be spread out over three to four years.
   However, Bild quoted Horst Teltschik, a top aide to Kohl, as
saying that he would not exclude that the withdrawal would take
place at a faster tempo than agreed upon earlier.
   Bild said that according to NATO reports, about 10,000 trains
with 50 cars each are needed to take all the troops home.
   East Germans have already begun to express impatience with the
Soviet troops' continued presence. Graffiti saying ``Russen Raus''
(Russians Out) is not uncommon in towns where Soviet soldiers are
stationed.
   Soviet troops have already started pulling out of Czechoslovakia
and Hungary as the once formidable Warsaw Pact disintegrates in the
face of democratic changes in Eastern Europe.
   Moscow will be losing its most important Warsaw Pact ally once
East Germany unites with West Germany, a member of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization. That is expected to occur by the end
of this year.

<HEAD>IRA Claims Responsibility For Killing Construction Worker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bomb placed on a mechanical
digger killed a construction worker Saturday, and the Irish
Republican Army reportedly claimed responsibility.
   Police said the 43-year-old married man, who was not identified,
died when the bomb exploded as he was preparing to climb aboard the
digger in a construction yard in Castlederg, County Tyrone. The man
worked part time for a local contractor.
   A Belfast radio station said the IRA claimed responsibility and
warned that anyone working on contracts for the Northern Ireland
security forces would continue to be ``legitimate targets.''
   Police said they had no information on whether the construction
company was involved in work for the security forces.
   The man was the 38th person to die in political and sectarian
violence in the province this year. More than 2,800 people have
died since the strife began in 1969.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the mainly Protestant province with the overwhelmingly Roman
Catholic Irish Republic.

<HEAD>Fear Grows Among Relatives of `Detainees'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pessimism enveloped relatives of American expatriates as Gulf
tensions moved up another notch and Iraq said foreigners there and
in Kuwait would be the first to suffer if a U.S. economic blockade
makes food and medicine scarce.
   The latest Iraqi statement about the detainees could be just
``more chest-thumping,'' said Donnita Cole, of Odessa, Texas, whose
50-year-old husband John Henry Cole was working for an oil company
in Kuwait. She added:
   ``I think we've got a big problem on our hands, and I don't
think protocol is going to work anymore. I think we're going into a
war.''
   ``This is, I guess, what we thought about and hoped it wouldn't
be a problem,'' said Bob Nickman of Pleasonton, Neb.
   Nickman, whose son Mike is stranded in Iraq, said he feared
Americans and other foreigners might suffer more than Iraqis from
any shortages.
   ``The Iraqi people would probably favor themselves,'' he said.
``That's natural.''
   Iraq, which imports three-fourths of its food, said Iraqi and
foreign babies and elderly people will be the first to feel the
effect as the nation ensures that food goes to its soldiers first.
   The Baghdad government is detaining 3,000 Americans, 4,000
Britons and about 14,000 other Westerners among the more than 2
million foreigners caught in Iraq and Kuwait when Iraq's president,
Saddam Hussein, invaded Kuwait.
   In a television interview broadcast Friday on ABC News, Mike
Nickman said he would like to leave Iraq ``as long as there's
anything possible that could happen here.''
   ``I would rather be out of here,'' the blond-haired Nickman said
calmly, adding, ``I miss my kids.''
   In Brockton, Mass., Dennis Trundy, husband of Mary Trundy, whose
twin brother is in Kuwait, said of the Iraqi statement:
   ``How do you react to that, it's just insane. This whole thing
is mess. I dont know how they're going to get them out. I have a
feeling it will come to a conflict. . . . They're not free to go.''
   Mary Trundy's brother, 43-year-old John Stevenson, had been
working as a computer systems analyst for a bank in Kuwait.
   For the Trundys the tense wait is familiar. In 1979 they waited
several days as Stevenson escaped from Iran, just hours before
militants took over the the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Stevenson had
been working for a computer firm in Iran. ``It's like history
repeating itself,'' Trundy said.
   Mrs. Cole, whose 50-year-old husband John Henry Cole is among
the detainees, said she has two sons in the Army, one on his way to
Saudi Arabia and the other on standby, and a son-in-law in the Air
Force who's also on standby.
   ``I'm worried to death,'' she said. ``I've known they were
serious all along. This has been serious since the day it started,
because you have to remember who you're dealing with.''
   A tearful Marjorie Walterscheid of Jacksboro, Texas, said she is
very upset about the statement, but it hasn't changed her opinion
about the outlook for her husband Rainard Walterscheid, 52.
   ``Well, I don't know that it's made a big change in my attitude
because I've considered them hostages from the beginning,'' she
said. ``I'm angry today, because there hasn't been anything done to
get them out. I want my husband out without bloodshed. I think it
should have been negotiated.
   ``I want my husband home. I have loved this country for 49
years, and I think my country should love me enough to bring my
husband home.''
   Even before Saturday's announcement, people like Patricia Heath
of Farmington Hills, Mich., were getting pessimistic.
   Her brother, Kevin Bazner, his wife, Dawn, and their children,
Elizabeth, 6, and David, 6 months, were stranded after their plane
stopped in Kuwait to refuel during the Aug. 2 invasion by Iraq.
   After Iraq announced Friday that it was detaining the Americans,
along with citizens of other Western countries, Heath was dismayed.
   ``When I first heard that, I was real negative and it was
probably the worst day I've had,'' Heath said.
   ``This is the hardest thing. Up to this time, we knew their
routine and now that is gone, we don't know where they are,'' said
Virginia Bazner, Kevin and Patricia's mother, from her home in
Palms Desert, Calif., home. ``Our strength is beginning to wane,
but we've got to remain strong.''

<HEAD>President Signs Alaska-Inspired Oill Cleanup Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Saturday signed a
bill, prompted by the Alaska oil spill, setting tougher standards
for ship construction and authorizing a $1 billion fund to cover
cleanup costs and damages not paid by the spiller.
   Bush complained that the measure contained a `highly
objectionable'' moratorium on exploration for oil and natural gas
off the coast of North Carolina's Outer Banks.
   ``Such a moratorium is ill-advised in view of recent events in
the Persian Gulf where I have found it necessary to deploy American
soldiers 7,000 miles from home to protect our vital national
interests,'' the president said.
   He said his administration would seek repeal of the ban.
   Saying that gas exploration carries little environmental risk,
Bush said, ``It is shortsighted to restrict exploration for this
relatively clean energy source.''
   The bill, spurred toward passage by the 11-million-gallon spill
by the Exxon Valdez in Alaska, requires double hull construction of
oil tankers and sets new crew licensing and manning requirements
for oil ships.
   Bush said the act ``addresses the wide-ranging problems
associated with preventing, responding to and paying for oil
spills.''
   ``It does so,'' he added, ``by creating a comprehensive regime
for dealing with vessel and facility-caused oil pollution.''
   The president said a $1 billion trust fund will be available to
cover cleanup costs and damages not compensated by the spiller.
However, he said the spiller's ``financial responsibility
requirements are greatly increased.''

   In 1938, as Hitler's army swarmed into Vienna, 10
Jewish youngsters in their last year of high school met to say
their goodbyes and made a pact.
   This was no ordinary class farewell, but a somber one against a
backdrop of anti-Semitic violence and the knowledge that if they
stayed, they were doomed. They knew they were about to become
refugees, so they promised one another they would meet again if
they survived.
   On Friday night they did.
   They traveled to London from homes in Australia, Israel, the
United States and England to dine on champagne and Wiener schnitzel
and resurrect long-forgotten childhood memories of soccer matches
and Monopoly games at Affi Aufrichtig's house on Heinzelmanngasse,
where they met for the last time.
   Each dinner place had a card with a nickname _ Affi, Dufschi,
Kiwi, Mond _ and a yellowing photo, their last group portrait
before they fled.
   One chair remained empty. Mandel ``Mandi'' Haber disappeared
during World War II, his refugee boat apparently torpedoed by a
German submarine. His name was by his plate all the same, at the
head of the table.
   They were 70 years old now, with wives and grown-up children.
They had been friends since the age of six, and still retained
their old-world Central European manners and Viennese accents,
laced with an American or Australian twang.
   Leo Sherwin fled to Shanghai, then settled in Melbourne,
Australia. George Kane made it to Sydney, Australia. Ken Hurst, Ken
Miller and Bert Binder reached England. Affi Aufrichtig, Otto
Neugasser and Bobby Postman settled in Israel.
   David ``Dufschi'' Rosenbluth, now living in South Nyack, N.Y.,
didn't even know until last June that the others were still alive.
``I had completely lost track of them,'' he said.
   The pact stipulated a reunion outside the Tel Aviv post office
on July 17, 1948, and the three who had reached Israel turned up.
Then, through newspaper ads and the International Red Cross, others
were gradually located. Finally, only Rosenbluth remained to be
traced.
   Hurst finally tracked him down through the Austrian government
pension fund, telephoned him in South Nyack and invited him to
London.
   ``When Ken Hurst phoned me, all these things that I hadn't
thought of for 50 years started coming back to me,'' he said,
sitting in the Czechoslovak Club where the dinner was held.
   ``The street we lived on, where we went to the opera, to soccer
games... And now it seems to me as though no time has elapsed at
all, because I can see how they were, not how they are. They're
still little boys.''
   Hurst became a toolmaker, then a manufacturer of Christmas
crackers. Sherwin was an electrician. Rosenbluth opened a
watch-repair store in Manhattan, while his parents emigrated to
Israel.
   Someone at the reunion remarked that Hitler was dead and the
youngsters he had driven into exile had survived and prospered.
Rosenbluth exclaimed: ``And we have a state!'' (Israel).
   ``It's great, unbelievable. Sometimes I just can't fathom the
things that are happening,'' he said.
   Some of the men have visited Vienna since the war, but say they
felt no connection to the place. Rosenbluth said he felt an
undercurrent of anti-Semitism.
   Hurst went back in 1980, having been offered a job there. He
revisited his old house, and the street where the Nazis forced him
to clean graffiti off a sidewalk with a toothbrush.
   ``I felt like a stranger who spoke the language. I went to
school and grew up there. But I just felt that I didn't belong,''
he said.
   After six weeks he moved back to England.

<HEAD>Colombians Pay Tribute To Slain Candidate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Colombians marched in the
streets of the capital Saturday to mark the anniversary of the
assassination of a leading presidential candidate who was shot and
killed by drug traffickers.
   The slaying of Luis Carlos Galan led to a major escalation in
fighting between the government and the Medellin drug cartel. The
fighting has claimed hundreds of lives.
   President Cesar Gaviria, who had served as Galan's campaign
manager, attended a morning Mass Saturday along with his Cabinet
and the slain candidate's family.
   Afterwards, thousands of people, many in tears, marched through
downtown Bogota to the Central Cemetery where Galan is buried.
   Marches were planned in cities throughout Colombia. Radio
stations said they would stop broadcasting for one minute at 7:45
p.m., the time Galan was killed by gunmen working for drug
traffickers.
   Newspapers dedicated long articles and columns to the life and
death of the assassinated leader.
   Galan was shot at a political rally near Bogota on Aug. 18,
1989. Polls indicated that the charismatic 46-year-old senator
would have won a landslide victory in the presidential elections.
   Immediately following Galan's death, the government of former
President Virgilio Barco began a major crackdown on drug
traffickers.
   Since then, drug lords have killed about 500 Colombians,
officials say. Among the dead were 200 police officers in Medellin,
Colombia's second largest city, and two other presidential
candidates.
   Gaviria has said his government will continue the hard-line
stance Galan advocated against drug traffickers.
   Following Galan's death, the United States sent Colombia $65
million in emergency aid to fight cocaine smugglers. The assistance
included 20 helicopters, bullet-proof vests and communications
equipment.
   Authorities have said the government's anti-drug offensive has
severely weakened the cartel.
   Security forces have seized some 41 tons of cocaine so far this
year, compared to 33 tons during all of 1989. U.S. officials say
the price of cocaine has risen dramatically, and supply is down.
   The government has extradited 22 suspected drug smugglers to the
United States.
   Colombia's Medellin and Cali drug cartels supply an estimated 80
percent of the cocaine used in the United States.

   WEST COVINA, Calif. _ The first U.S. soldier to die in the troop
buildup in Saudi Arabia was remembered Saturday as a patriot and a
peacemaker.
   About 300 people attended a funeral for Air Force Staff Sgt.
John Campisi, who was hit by a military truck on a darkened runway
in Saudi Arabia last Sunday. Campisi, 30, was an aircraft mechanic
at Offutt Air Force Base, Neb.
   ``He's the one we called the peacemaker. His patience and caring
always got everyone through the hard and difficult times,'' said
Mark Rizkowsky, a friend of Campisi's for 25 years and best man at
his wedding.
   Another longtime friend, David Saldana, finished the eulogy when
Rizkowsky, overcome with emotion, was unable to continue. He spoke
of Campisi the career soldier and his dedication to the military.
   Monsignor Helmut Hefner told the mourners at St. Christopher
Catholic Church that he hoped others would not die in the Persian
Gulf. Iraq leader Saddam Hussein invaded neighboring Kuwait and
vowed to wage a holy war against nations that intervene.
   ``We must not let some madman, who cries for holy war, as if
there were such a thing as holy war, stampede us,'' Hefner said.
   Later, an honor guard saluted Campisi as he was laid to rest at
Queen of Heavens Cemetery. After a bugler played taps, the American
flag draped over the soldier's casket was folded and presented to
his wife, Charlene, who wept as she stood arm-in-arm with her
9-year-old daughter, the eldest of their four children.
   Campisi was from West Covina, a Los Angeles suburb.

<HEAD>50,000 Turn Out For Pro-Democracy Rally in Zambia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MELINDA HAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KABWE, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 50,000 people cheered Saturday as
pro-democracy activists called for the end of nearly two decades of
one-party rule. It was the first such rally in 17 years.
   The rally was the biggest political gathering since Zambia's
independence in 1964, organizers said.
   Pro-democracy leaders chose Kabwe for their first display of
mass support because President Kenneth Kaunda's ruling party was
founded in this provincial mining center 112 miles north of the
capital, Lusaka.
   Frederick Chiluba, head of the powerful Zambia Congress of Trade
Unions, told the thousands of cheering supporters that their
presence showed that Kaunda's United National Independence Party
had been abandoned by its followers.
   ``I have come to Kabwe with an open invitation to ask you to
board the ship going to democracy,'' Chiluba said, holding up his
index finger as the symbol of the multiparty campaign.
   ``The hour has come for you to divorce the one-party system,''
Chiluba said.
   More than 300 police and troops, some of them armed, surrounded
the 5{-hour gathering, which dispersed peacefully.
   Organizers said scores of supporters were bussed to the rally
from most parts of the country.
   In a carnival atmosphere, buses, trucks and cars heading to and
from Kabwe honked their horns as drivers and passengers exchanged
greetings.
   Chiluba and fellow officials of the National Interim Committee
For Multiparty Democracy were carried shoulder-high by supporters
who sang Zambia's national anthem. Many wore T-shirts bearing the
heart-shaped legend ``I Love Multiparty.''
   Addressing the rally, campaign chairman Arthur Wina, a former
finance minister, accused Kaunda of bankrupting this southern
African nation of 7.5 million people. Zambia ranks among the
world's poorest countries.
   ``We are confident nothing can be worse than the present
system,'' Wina said.
   Kaunda, 66, led the British colony of Northern Rhodesia to
independence. The colony was then renamed Zambia.
   One-party rule was imposed in 1973, and Kaunda has been
unchallenged as president virtually ever since.
   In June, however, police opened fire on people rioting over a
dramatic increase in food prices. At least 27 people died in the
rioting, mainly in police and army gunfire.
   The bloodshed and price increases sparked demands for Kaunda's
ouster.
   Kaunda responded by freeing political prisoners, ending a night
curfew and allowing opponents to campaign for a referendum on
Zambia's political future that is scheduled for next August.
   The pro-democracy committee is backed by trade union leaders,
businessmen, students and former politicians.
   Kaunda has said he will campaign vigorously to maintain
one-party rule and has accused pro-democracy activists of waging a
political war against him financed by foreigners. Pro-democracy
leaders have denied receiving foreign funds.

<HEAD>Catalog Shopper Charged With Theft Over House Full of Orders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man caught up in a mail order frenzy
used phony names to order about $200,000 worth of merchandise _ up
to 50 boxes a day _ and simply threw the bills away, police said.
   Thomas J. Hoffmann, 35, used five post office boxes and 227
aliases to receive the catalog merchandise, said Sgt. Randy Crowe.
He was charged Thursday with three counts of theft.
   Police recovered enough goods from Hoffmann's home and two
storage rooms to nearly fill an 8,000-square-foot postal service
warehouse, Crowe said.
   Sixteen officers spent six hours Thursday sorting through the
orders so they could be returned. Among them were books, magazines,
clothes, porcelain plates, globes, videotapes and more than 600
compact discs.
   ``He told us this was kind of something that snowballed on
him,'' Crowe said. ``He did it for a little while and then he kept
getting more packages in and he got to the point where he didn't
know what to do with the stuff.''
   Hoffmann placed his first order about a year ago, said Crowe.
Packages poured in from about 60 companies across the country.
   Other charges were possible, but only three companies were
verified as victims Thursday, Crowe said.
   Hoffmann was released Thursday night from East Baton Rouge
Parish Prison on a $20,000 signature bond.
   The investigation began when one of the mail-order firms
notified a postal inspector of a problem at one Hoffmann's post
office boxes.

<HEAD>Newspaper Keeps Mum on Stock Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Executives of the St. Petersburg
Times said settlement of a stock dispute left them weighing a
professional commitment to tell all against a corporate decision to
keep mum.
   ``We may have to wrestle with the fact that we're being attacked
for not doing what we wish we could do, but there it is'' Times
Publishing chairman Andrew Barnes said.
   The Times Publishing Co. and a minority investor group led by
Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass announced on Friday the settlement
of a bitter months-long stock feud involving the state's
second-largest paper.
   The parties put out a joint statement on the agreement, but
significant details were not addressed _ such as the amount of
money exchanged and the percentage of ownership Bass maintains.
   In the three-page statement, they said they agreed not to
comment further on terms of the settlement.
   Barnes told the newsroom Friday that most details of the
settlement were kept secret and must remain so under the pact.
   ``It puts the Times, a newspaper that crusades for openness, in
an awkward, even embarrassing position. But Barnes said this
consideration is outweighed by something more important: ensuring
the newspaper's independence,'' the Times reported Saturday.
   Both sides said they were pleased with the agreement, which
Barnes said ensured long-term journalistic control of the newspaper.
   The Bass group, called the Poynter-Jamison Ventures Limited
Partnership, dropped its federal suit. In return, the Times agreed
to call in stock that was at the center of the dispute. The Bass
group bought 200 shares in the paper's parent company, Times
Publishing Co., two years ago from the nieces of the late Nelson
Poynter, longtime publisher.
   The Bass partners sued the Times in February, claiming that
their 200 shares, which represented 40 percent of the publishing
company's common stock, brought only 6 percent of the company's
dividends.
   Most of the publishing company's dividends have gone to the
Poynter Institute for Media Studies, a not-for-profit journalism
school set up by Poynter. The institute holds controlling interest
in Times Publishing which owns the newspaper, Congressional
Quarterly and other magazines.
   Times attorney George Rahdert, who usually argues for openness
on behalf of the newspaper, said he doesn't see where the secrecy
agreement should have any bearing on the paper's pursuit of
information about court settlements in other cases.
   ``I don't foresee this being a problem. This is a private
business transaction,'' he said, adding that the company was not a
public body.
   But clearly Rahdert didn't view the settlement as any big
conquest for the Times.
   ``I wouldn't really characterize this as a victory,'' he said.
``It's a resolution of a thorny problem.''

<TEXT>
   Two West German political leaders on Saturday
urged East German lawmakers to decide this week to merge with West
Germany, saying overwhelming economic and political problems make
quick action essential.
   ``Every day that it is delayed, the crisis is worsened and the
costs of unity are driven upward,'' said Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier,
deputy chief of the Social Democratic faction in the West German
Parliament.
   She told the West German newspaper Bild am Sonntag that the
historic decision should be made when the East German Parliament
meets on Wednesday.
   Erwin Huber, general secretary of the West German Christian
Social Union, also said in an interview with the newspaper that his
party supports rapid unity. Huber's party is the Bavarian sister
party of the Christian Democrats of West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl.
   The left-leaning Social Democrats are the second-largest party
in the broad governing coalition of East German Prime Minister
Lothar de Maiziere. The Social Democrats are the opposition in the
West German parliament.
   The East Geman Social Democrats are to vote on Sunday whether to
leave the coalition, following the latest of many threats it has
made to break up the nation's first democratically chosen Cabinet.
   The Social Democrats are angry that de Maiziere unilaterally
fired four Cabinet ministers on Wednesday.
   Even if the Social Democrats left his coalition, de Maiziere
would still be able to run the government and German unity still
would likely take place by year's end.
   All the major parties are committed to German unity and single
German elections are tentatively set for Dec. 2.
   However, the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats of de
Maiziere and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl still differ over a
state treaty that is to spell out the details of a political merger
and reconcile the differing laws of the nations.
   The two parties also have been trying to use the timing and pace
of unification to their best political advantage. The prolonged
political dispute has virtually paralyzed the unification debate.
   However, pressure appeared to be building Saturday for East
Germany to end its political squabbling and move quickly on
unification.
   Joblessness has been rising as East German factories struggle
against competition from the West since the nation converted to a
free market on July 1.
   United German elections are tentatively set for Dec. 2. Kohl
failed in his attempt to get the elections moved up to Oct. 14,
when East Germany is to hold state elections.
   East Germany must enact a clause in the West German Constitution
in order to unify with West Germany.
   The Christian Democrats want unity and elections to take place
almost simultaneously. The Social Democrats say they want
unification to take place quickly but that it doesn't have to be
tied to elections.

<HEAD>Newspaper Study Suggests Race Influences Justice</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Killers and rapists whose victims were white got
more severe punishment than those whose victims were black or
Hispanic, in a newspaper survey of sentencing in Dallas County in
1988.
   A story in Sunday's Dallas Times Herald said a review of cases
that year showed a conviction for the murder of a white person
resulted in an average prison sentence of 30 years. That compared
with 20 years for the murder of a black person and 12{ years for a
Hispanic.
   The rape of a white resulted in a median sentence of 10 years,
compared with two years for the rape of a black and five years for
a Hispanic.
   The punishment almost doubled when the attacker and victim were
of different races, the newspaper reported.
   Except for such interracial crimes, sentencing disparities were
much less pronounced for attempted murder and aggravated assault,
the newspaper said.
   David Baldus, an Iowa law professor who has studied race effects
in death penalty cases, said the study suggests that white-victim
crime, particularly rape, is treated ``quite differently'' in
Dallas.
   Scott Anderson, president of the Dallas County Criminal Bar
Association, was more blunt.
   ``The system's racist,'' he said. ``Most people are struggling
to overcome it, but it exists. It starts all the way down in the
police department and goes all the way to the top of the district
attorney's office.''
   District Attorney John Vance said Texas should follow the lead
of Congress and 31 states that have reformed the sentencing process
to eliminate unjustifiable disparities.
   ``I think we need to take a real serious look at the federal
system (of sentencing guidelines), and that's the only time I've
ever said that in my life,'' said Vance. Through plea bargaining,
his office effectively sets punishment in more than 90 percent of
such felonies.
   In the study, the Times Herald noted legal factors that affect
punishment, including previous felony convictions, aggravating
circumstances and multiple offenses punished by the same sentence.
   Judges, prosecutors and legal experts propose numerous theories
for the sentencing inequities, including the quality of legal aid
for indigent defendants, the reluctance of minorities to testify,
and jury-imposed sentencing.
   A University of New Mexico sociologist who has studied the
criminal justice system's handling of rape says the unequal
punishment in cases involving black and white victims is a vestige
of slavery days.
   ``At one point in our history, rapes were treated differently by
law if a black man raped a white woman. And I think you still have
lingering effects of that,'' said Gary LaFree, author of the 1989
book ``Rape and Criminal Justice.''
   State District Judge Pat McDowell said the victim's social
status also was a factor in sentencing.
   ``A prosecutor can make a much stronger argument in favor of
severe punishment when the victim is an upstanding, contributing
member of the community, than he can if the victim is a street
person,'' McDowell said.
   ``It really shouldn't be that way,'' he said. ``But
unfortunately, that's part of our society.''
   Jury sentencing disparities reflect ``the kind of jurors we have
in Dallas County,'' said lawyer Adelfa B. Callejo.
   ``Subconsciously, I think the attitude is that the life of a
white person is worth more than the life of a black or Hispanic,''
she said. ``But it's not just in the courts; it's apparent in every
aspect of life in Dallas.''

<DATELINE>JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia is ready to increase
its oil output by up to 2 million barrels a day to help offset the
world shortfall caused by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the oil
minister indicated Saturday.
   Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told a news conference in Jiddah that
his country would have ``no alternative'' but to increase oil
production unilaterally if OPEC does not convene an emergency
meeting requested by Saudi Arabia.
   If the OPEC session fails to get off the ground, ``then it will
be left for each member state to decide alone'' on the increase in
output, he told the Western and Saudi journalists.
   ``Immediately means immediately,'' he said when asked how long
the Saudis will wait for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to schedule a meeting.
   He said that Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter,
could increase its output by up to 2 million barrels a day within
days.
   But he said Saudi Arabia alone cannot make up for the 4 million
barrels of oil a day that international markets lost by the removal
of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil.
   By invading and annexing Kuwait, Iraq gained control of about 20
percent of the world's oil reserves, and the withdrawal of its
crude from the market has caused oil and gas prices to soar.
   Most nations have declared support for U.N. sanctions against
Baghdad, including an oil embargo.
   Nazer said Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates each could
increase output by 500,000 barrels a day, but ``this would leave us
with 1 million barrels less.''
   In Georgetown, Guyana, Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez
told reporters Friday he favors convening an OPEC meeting soon, but
did not indicate when it might take place.
   He said OPEC has an obligation to maintain stability in the oil
market.
   Nazer said the Saudis are awaiting responses to their request
for an OPEC meeting. He criticized some OPEC members such as
Nigeria which have resisted holding another meeting less than a
month after the oil exporters' last session in Switzerland.
   The last meeting on July 26-27 in Geneva came after Iraq accused
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of flooding the market with oil
and driving down prices.
   At that meeting, OPEC fixed a production ceiling of almost 22.5
million barrels a day for the 13 member nations to defend a
$21-a-barrel price. Saudi Arabia agreed to a production quota of
5.38 million barrels a day.
   Nazer commented, ``Now this has all been changed. The price now
stands at $28 per barrel, and the daily production figure is far
less than 22.4 million. The shortage of 4 million barrels a day can
increase if the tension continues.
   ``All OPEC members together should make up for this shortage.
   ``We will not let the Third World countries down, and so will
increase production.''
   Nazer said failure to stabilize oil prices and production would
not only devastate developing nations, but also hurt OPEC in the
long run.
   Less oil would lead to higher prices in the marketplace, trigger
a recession among industrial nations, and spur them to develop
alternative energy sources, he said.
   He suggested that the oil situation could improve if the United
States and other industrialized countries open their strategic
stockpiles to the market.
   The reporters were invited by the Saudi government to travel to
the Red Sea city of Jidday, about 1,000 miles from where thousands
of U.S. troops and other members of a multinational force are
deploying on the Persian Gulf.
   Oil industry sources in Saudi Arabia told The Associated Press
on Friday that the kingdom would increase its output.
   Saudi Arabia is the dominant OPEC state, with a quarter of known
world reserves.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, predicted that
the OPEC session called by Saudi Arabia would convene Monday or
Tuesday in Geneva.
   They did not say what might happen if not all OPEC members
agreed to participate.
   Iraq has criticized Saudi Arabia for calling the meeting, saying
the Saudis created the shortfall by blocking Iraqi oil exports from
the trans-Saudi oil pipeline.
   In Saudi Arabia's first direct official comment, Nazer confirmed
that his country had turned away two Iraqi tankers that tried to
load oil from the pipeline terminal. He said it did so ``after the
U.N. Security Council resolution on sanctions.''
   Meanwhile, the turmoil in the Middle East, where thousands of
U.S. troops are being deployed to defend Saudi Arabia against a
possible Iraqi attack, continued to create havoc on world markets.
   Unleaded gasoline hit a record high Friday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, as crude oil prices shot up and speculators
kept betting that the Middle East standoff would curtail supplies.
   September wholesale unleaded gas futures soared to as high as
96.25 cents before settling at 95.97 cents per gallon, up 8.5 cents
from Thursday's record close.
   The September contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude, finished up $1.27 at $28.63 per barrel.
   For the week, September crude rose $2.40 per barrel, while
unleaded gasoline was up 16.5 cents a gallon.

   Flooding and heavy rain swept Midwest states Saturday while rain
was scattered in the East and the weather was generally mild in the
West.
   Heavy rains were recorded in Minnesota, South Dakota, northern
Nebraska, Indiana and Wisconsin.
   Tomah, Wis., got five to eight inches of rain late Friday and
early Saturday, causing flooding that forced hundreds to leave
their homes and threatened the Tonah Lake Dam on the Lemonweir
River.
   Several large carp were seen swimming across the street at a
Chicago office of the National Weather Service after nearly three
inches of rain fell overnight, leaving a foot of water on Higgins
Road.
   A small tributary of the Des Plaines river overflowed onto the
road, the weather service said.
   Two to five inches of rain fell in west-central and southeastern
Minnesota and across northern and east-central Indiana late Friday
and early Saturday.
   Aberdeen, S.D., got a total of 3{ inches a rain Friday.
   Lake and Porter counties, in northwestern Indiana, were drenched
early Saturday, with some areas reporting seven inches of rain.

<HEAD>Lebanese Prisoner Says `Kuwait 15' Escaped Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YATER, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Lebanese Shiite Moslem who claims he
escaped from prison in Kuwait during the Iraqi invasion said
Saturday that 15 convicted terrorists linked to kidnappers in
Lebanon also fled from jail.
   A Shiite fundamentalist group, Islamic Jihad, which has been
holding Americans Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland for more
than five years, had demanded the release of the 15 prisoners in
return for freeing the two Americans.
   The Lebanese who said he escaped, Abdel-Aziz Krayyem, said
Saturday he was imprisoned in 1985 on charges of cooperating with
the 15, mostly Iranian and Iraqi Shiites, convicted in the 1983
bombing of the U.S. and French embassies, as well as Kuwaiti
installations.
   Krayyem said he was among 1,600 prisoners who overpowered their
guards and escaped when they heard about the invasion. He said the
15 were among those who got out.
   ``I saw them climbing into taxicabs with Kuwaiti plate
numbers,'' Krayyem said and the cars sped away. ``That's all I
saw.''
   However, the report could not be independently verified.
   Earlier, unconfirmed reports speculated that the 15 had either
been taken to Baghdad or executed.
   Krayyem said he had no idea of the current whereabouts of the 15.
   He said he hid out for 10 days with Kuwaiti inmates who got
their families to collect them after the jailbreak. The Lebanese
Embassy issued a new passport for him and he joined a car convoy
sponsored by the embassy that passed through Saudi Arabia, then
Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, he said.
   Krayyem, 35, arrived Friday in his hometown of Yater, 56 miles
south of Beirut.
   He said he was first jailed for a few days with the convicts,
then numbering 17, before he was placed in isolation at Kuwait's
central prison.
   Two of the 17 original prisoners were released in February 1989
after serving five-year sentences. The Kuwaitis refused to free any
of the others before completion of sentences, most ranging to 15
years.
   Kuwait's emir had not signed several death sentences,
effectively commuting them to life.
   Kuwaiti interrogators linked Krayyem to the 15 for having
explosives in his house but he said he was framed. ``Believe me I
had nothing to do with them,'' he Krayyem said Kuwaiti prison
guards told the inmates about the invasion.
   ``Chaos broke out immediately and the prisoners started shouting
at the guards. The guards fired at them, killing an Iraqi and an
Afghani prisoner,'' Krayyem said.
   ``After a few hours of fighting with the guards, the prisoners
were able to occupy the prison and overthrow the guards,'' he said.
   There are 14 Western hostages held in Lebanon, including six
Americans. The longest held is Anderson, 41, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

   U.S. warships fired shots in an effort to
stop two Iraqi tankers Saturday, the first such confrontation in
the Persian Gulf crisis. Iraq warned of ``grave consequences'' if
it happens again.
   The United States said the gunfire involved only warning shots,
but Iraq said U.S. ships had shot at the Iraqi vessels.
   Also Saturday, Iraq called the economic embargo against it an
``act of war'' and said thousands of foreigners it holds will go
hungry along with Iraqis. The embargo was imposed in the wake of
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Baghdad also threatened to use weapons of ``mass destruction''
against any attackers. The weapons were not specified, but Iraq has
chemical weapons and long-range missiles.
   In the confrontation on the high seas, Oil Minister Issam
Chalabi said U.S. warships had fired on two Iraqi oil tankers: the
Baba Karkar in the Persian Gulf and the Khanaqin in the Gulf of
Oman.
   A U.S. administration source with President Bush in
Kennebunkport, Maine, confirmed U.S. forces had fired to stop two
Iraqi ships, one in the Persian Gulf and the other in the Gulf of
Oman to the south. In each case, ``warning shots were fired after
bridge-to-bridge communications,'' the source said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The shots were the first fired in the 2-day-old interdiction
effort ordered by Bush to halt goods leaving and entering Iraq.
   Military sources in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, said the
two incidents occurred about an hour apart around dusk.
   The two 3,600-ton guided-missile frigates involved, the USS Reid
and USS Robert G. Bradley, are both part of the Navy's regular Gulf
task force and had been on duty in the region before the Aug. 2
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The two ships also saw service escorting
U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in 1987-88 during the Iraq-Iran war.
   A U.S. Navy official who briefed reporters traveling with
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said that in the Gulf of Oman
incident, the Reid fired warning shots across the bow of an Iraqi
oil tanker. The official said U.S. forces briefly went to battle
stations during the incident.
   The Khanaqin, which was loaded with oil, refused repeated
requests to halt, and the Reid fired six warning shots across the
tanker's bow, the military sources said.
   The weapon used could not be immediately confirmed, but was
believed to be the 76mm gun located amidships on the top deck, the
sources said.
   In the next incident, the USS Robert G. Bradley, homeported in
Charleston, S.C., intercepted another Iraqi tanker inside the
Persian Gulf and fired three warning shots across its bow when it
refused to stop, the sources said.
   ``Both tankers are continuing under way, but are under close
U.S. surveillance,'' said a U.S. military official on condition of
anonymity.
   U.S. military officials have indicated that if Iraqi ships
ignored warnings to stop, the next move might be to attempt to
disable them by shooting at their rudders or propellers.
   Chalabi said the shots came after the ships refused to allow
themselves to be searched, according to a statement carried by the
official Iraqi news agency. He said the shots did not strike the
ships and they proceeded without stopping.
   ``The Oil Ministry of the Iraqi republic therefore warns that
any interception of its tankers and their crews will result in
grave consequences which the American authorities bear
responsibility for,'' he said.
   The threat that foreigners held in Iraq would suffer the same
shortages of food as the Iraqi public came in a statement from the
ministry of labor and social affairs, also carried by the Iraqi
news agency and monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus.
   The Baghdad government holds 3,000 Americans, 4,000 Britons and
about 14,000 other Westerners among the more than 2 million
foreigners caught in Iraq and Kuwait after the invasion.
   Iraq singled out the United States for the blame in blocking
food supplies, accusing Washington of going beyond the mandatory
U.N. sanctions in denying Iraq food and medicine and in acting
militarily to prevent shipments.
   ``Such an act by international law is known as an act of war,''
said the Iraqi statement.
   The Iraqis said the blockade would deny children their milk,
medication and other necessities, and said foreign children would
be subject to the same restrictions.
   ``We have decided to place the children of foreign families
which Iraq has decided to host in equality with the children of
Iraq and ... what affects the children of Iraq will equally affect
them,'' said the statement.
   Iraq said its military would be given priority in the
distribution of supplies because they are ``the shield of the
nation.''
   The latest statement came a day after the Iraqi parliament
speaker, Sadi Mahdi Saleh, said the foreigners would be held as
long as the threat of war persists. A multinational force of
thousands of troops, spearheaded by the United States, was deployed
in Saudi Arabia to defend it against possible Iraqi attack in the
wake of the invasion.
   ``The people of Iraq have decided to play host to the citizens
of these aggressive nations as long as Iraq remains threatened with
an aggressive war,'' the Iraqi official said then.
   The Iraqi government later said the statement did not apply to
Egyptians. More than 1.5 million Egyptians make up the bulk of
guest workers in Iraq and Kuwait.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz warned that Arabs could follow
a U.S. precedent to intercept shipping, and hinted at a blockade of
the Red Sea. About 10 percent of the world's oil flows through the
sea up to the Suez Canal.
   Yemen, which controls the Mandab straits at the southern end of
the Red sea, is sympathetic to Iraq.
   Traffic through the Suez Canal, the other end of the Red Sea
from the Mandab straits, averages 50 ships daily. About one third
of the annual traffic is oil tankers, both from the Persian Gulf
and eastern Saudi ports. The oil going through the canal counts for
about 10 percent of the world's seaborne oil trade.
   The threat regarding use of weapons on mass destruction came in
the Iraqi army daily newspaper al-Qaddasiyah. It said ``weapons of
mass destruction and strategic deterrence possessed by Iraq will be
lying in wait to turn those who contemplate committing aggression
into scattered pieces.''
   Iraq has used poison gas against Iran during their eight-year
war and against its own Kurdish minority.

   Salaam and McCray had been free on $25,000 bail; Santana had
been unable to make the bail.
   The three each faced from to five to 10 years in prison on the
rape count. They were to be sentenced as juvenile offenders on

   When the jury foreman Earle Fisher read the innocent verdict on
the attempted murder count, a quick smattering of applause broke

   The three also were convicted of charges stemming from an attack
on two male joggers in the park that night.
   According to prosecutors, the woman was jogging through the
northern end of the park at about 10 p.m. at night when she was
attacked. She was dragged about 70 feet into the woods, gang-raped
and bashed repeatedly with a brick.
   The jogger trial had become controversial for unexpected reasons.
   While the woman's recovery from near-total paralysis was
inspirational to some New Yorkers, a few activists, including the
controversial Rev. Al Sharpton, demonstrated daily outside the
courthouse, claiming the youths were railroaded because they were
black and the victim white.
   The jury made its decision at the close of its 10th day of
deliberations.
   Salaam and McCray both gave videotaped statements in which they
confessed to being part of a gang that assaulted the woman. Much of
the defense's case rested on its claim that the testimony was given
under duress.
   Earlier Saturday, the jurors had asked for the fourth time since
they began deliberations to see the videotaped statement of McCray,
in which he told police he kicked the jogger and feigned sex with
her to impress his friends.
   The jury also asked to rehear the testimony of Detective Harry
Hildebrandt, who interviewed McCray after his arrest.
   The detective testified he offered McCray no deal in return for
his statement; the boy's father, Bobby, testified he encouraged his
son to talk because he was led to believe there was an agreement.

<HEAD>Text of Statement from Iraqi Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This is a statement issued Saturday by
the Iraqi Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. It was monitored
and translated by The Associated Press:
   In light of the decision taken by the representatives of the
Iraqi people and announced by the president of the National Council
yesterday, which asserted that the Iraqi people are a peaceful
people who want peace and refuse war and those who call for it, and
in light of the fact that the Iraqis have not attacked the West and
its legal interests, and because some Western countries have
declared enmity to the Iraqi people through U.S. provocation, and
because the U.S. and whoever cooperates with her are pushing
towards war against Iraq, in addition to its occupation of Arab
land and the sanctities of the Moslems in Hijaz and Najd (Saudi
Arabia), and because the presence of Westerners in Iraq is probably
one of the means which will achieve peace and prevent aggression
and war and make the American president and his allies reconsider
their aggressive policies, therefore the Ministry of Labor and
Social Affairs announces the following:
   1) America and its allies have surpassed the economic boycott
which in its core means no exchange of buying or selling only.
Instead, they proceeded with applying an economic seige by military
force against Iraq, which includes food and medication. And such an
act by international law is known as act of war, and has led and
will lead to a shortage in imported food and goods including
children's milk. And because the children of the world are beloved
of God and of Saddam Hussein and in compliance with our
humanitarian principles, we have decided the following:
   To place the children of foreign families which Iraq has decided
to host in equality with the children of Iraq and if the children's
milk, medication and other necessities should become scarce due to
the boycott, what affects the children of Iraq will equally affect
them (foreign children).
   2) Due to the circumstances of boycott and economic seige which
have been imposed by the United States by military means, food will
not be available to all adults in the amounts we would wish. The
peoples of Europe, in particular the British, have gone through
such an experience or something resembling it before. Therefore
they understand the circumstances and the arrangements.
   It's natural in such a situation to give priority in terms of
quality and quantity of food to the armed forces because it is the
shield of the nation and the people against aggression and to the
workers in war-related factories and industries and give others a
different level of attention. Also because foreigners will not be
in the armed forces or any of the activities related to that,
therefore their share of food in terms of quality and quantity with
other Iraqis will be affected by our import of food in one way or
the other.
   3) Based on number 2 and in order to ensure the level and
quantity of food needed for both foreigners and Iraqis, the right
solution is to put an end to the sanctions which the United States
have imposed on Iraq and the economic siege which (President) Bush
and his allies are working on implementing by military force and in
an individual manner and as a fast and advanced procedure not to
boycott everything related with food, medication and goods of
humanitarian nature.
   We call on families of foreigners in Iraq and all those who are
in solidarity with them, humanitarian societies in the West and the
world to raise their voices to achieve these noble humanitarian
goals.
   May God bless those who call for peace and love and refuse war
and aggression.

   In its latest statement Saturday, Iraq made clear that it hopes
to use those foreign captives to force the lifting of economic
sanctions imposed on it it and to prevent U.S.-led forces from
invading Kuwait or Iraq.
   Saturday's statement, which referred to the U.S. quarantine as a
``blockade'' and ``an act of war,'' said that as food and medicine
become scarce in Iraq, supplies will be set aside for the military,
Iraq's ``the shield of the homeland.''
   The statement referred specifically to U.S. military moves to
enforce the international embargo on Iraqi goods and oil.
   Bush has authorized the interdiction of shipments to Iraq, a
move that has drawn criticism from some U.S. allies and also from
U.N. Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar, who approved the economic
sanctions. The United States has refused to use the word
``blockade.''
   Iraq, which imports three-quarters of its food, suggested in the
statement that foreigners whose countries have experienced wars in
the past will understand the Iraqi decision to reserve needed
supplies for its military.
   ``The peoples of Europe, in particular the British, have gone
through such an experience, or something resembling it, before,''
said the statement, which was carried on Iraqi telvision and read
by an unidentified announcer.
   Children and the elderly among the foreign nationals would feel
the effects of shortages along with their Iraqi counterparts, it
said.
   ``Because of the embargo, food cannot be secured for aged
persons in the manner that we wish,'' the statement said. ``If
there were to be any reduction in the necessities of babies, then
the same calamity affecting the Iraqi newborn will affect similarly
the foreign babies.''
   ``The right solution is for the embargo to end which the United
States deliberately imposed on the Iraqis,'' the statement said.
   The White House said on Saturday that Iraq's holding of American
and other foreign citizens is ``totally unacceptable.''
   Bush, who was vacantioning in Kennebunkport, Maine, called on
Iraq to immediately reconsider its refusal to let the foreigners
leave.
   ``The use of innocent civilians as pawns to promote what Iraq
sees to be its self-interest is contrary to international law and
indeed to all accepted norms of international conduct,'' White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``We urge that Iraq immediately reconsider its refusal to allow
any foreign national desiring to leave to do so without delay or
condition,'' he said.
   Britain called Iraq's threat to detain Westerners ``unlawful and
inhuman'' and said it would not be deterred from helping defend
Persian Gulf states against Iraqi aggression.

   Three teen-agers were convicted Saturday of
raping and assaulting a woman jogger who was brutalized and left
for dead in Central Park by a marauding gang of youths.
   The defendants _ Antron McCray, 16, Yusef Salaam, 16 and Raymond
Santana, 15 _ were found innocent of sodomy and of attempted
murder, the most serious charge in the much-publicized case.
   The 30-year-old jogger was found lying senseless in a pool of
blood after the April 19, 1989, attack. In a coma for two weeks,
she later recovered and returned to her job as an investment banker.
   The case engendered enormous local concern for the victim, who
hasn't been publicly named. The defendants' supporters demonstrated
outside the courthouse regularly, charging racism because the
victim was white and wealthy, the youths black.
   Prosecutors said the three defendants were part of a gang of as
many as 30 youths who rampaged through the park, harassing at least
nine people. Three other teen-agers charged in the assault on the
woman are free on bond.
   Salaam, McCray and Santana also were convicted of charges
stemming from an attack on two male joggers in the park.
   The three were ordered remanded to jail without bail. Each faced
from to five to 10 years in prison on the rape count alone. They
were to be sentenced as juvenile offenders on Sept. 11.
   The woman was jogging through the northern end of the park when
she was attacked. She was dragged about 70 feet into the woods,
gang-raped and bashed repeatedly with a brick and pipe.
   She battled back from her near-fatal injuries, returned to work
and to jogging within eight months of the attack, and is currently
a vice president for Salomon Brothers, a Wall Street firm.
   The jogger trial had become controversial for unexpected reasons.
   While the woman's recovery from near-total paralysis was
inspirational to some New Yorkers, a few activists, including the
Rev. Al Sharpton, claimed police had arrested the youths because
they were black.
   The defense attorneys said Salaam and McCray had made their
videotaped confessions under duress.
   The defendants showed no emotion at all when the verdict was
read. The jurors looked tired and haggard on their 10th day of
deliberations.
   Earlier Saturday, the jurors had asked for the fourth time since
they began deliberations to see the videotaped statement of McCray,
in which he told police he kicked the jogger and feigned sex with
her to impress his friends.
   McCray's father, Bobby McCray, testified he had encouraged his
son to give false testimony of his involvement because he was led
to believe there was an agreement. The detective who took the
testimony said no such deal was offered.
   Another detective testified that Santana told him he counted 33
youths who entered the park shortly after 9 p.m. on the night of
the attack to ``beat up and rip off joggers and cyclists.''
   When the group saw the female jogger on her nightly six-mile
run, ``We all charged her,'' McCray said on the videotape. She
struggled and screamed as several teens dragged her from the paved
drive down a wooded slope into the darkness, he said.
   The defendants told detectives the naked woman was struck with a
metal pipe, bashed in the head and face with a brick, cut on the
legs with a knife and sexually attacked in a frenzy of violence,
assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Lederer said.
   The rampaging youths went on to attack several other people _
teacher John Loughlin, hospitalized for two days with his injuries;
banker David Lewis, who escaped serious injury because of his
speed; and John Goode, a British Airways employee who was punched.
   Medical workers testified the woman had lost about
three-quarters of her blood by the time she arrived at a hospital.
She spent two weeks in a coma, a doctor said, and later was
transferred to a Wallingford, Conn., rehabilitation center.

   Pearl Bailey was 15 when she sang ``Poor
Butterfly'' in an amateur contest and won a $5 prize. She went on
to win the hearts of millions as a singer, actress and America's
``ambassador of love.''
   Bailey, 72, died at a Philadelphia hospital Friday night.
   ``She was a rare Pearl,'' her road manager E.B. Smith said
Saturday.
   Bailey was known for playing matchmaker Dolly in the black
version of the musical ``Hello, Dolly!'' on Broadway from 1967 to
1969. Others loved her throaty, expressive versions of ``Bill
Bailey, Won't You Please Come Home,'' ``St. Louis Blues,'' ``Row,
Row, Row,'' and ``That's Good Enough for Me.''
   But Bailey's favorite role was that of ``ambassador of love''
and special delegate to the United Nations, where she could spread
her warmth to the world.
   ``You may agree or disagree, but most of all, I think we love,
and we're never quite sure why we love or how we love,'' she said
in an interview in July. ``We just love. And that's it.''
   ``The entertainment world has lost one of the most creative
performers of our time,'' said Carol Channing, who played Dolly on
Broadway in 1964. ``Her talent was unique and enduring and her
warmth was felt by everyone in the audience.''
   Her co-star in ``Hello, Dolly!,'' veteran song-and-dance man Cab
Calloway, said, ``I have lost one of the greatest friends I've ever
had in my life.
   From Philadelphia, Pearl Mae Bailey's career took her to music
halls in small Pennsylvania coal towns, and then to vaudeville,
Broadway, movies and television. She performed with some of the
greatest singers, dancers and comedians of her time.
   Bailey had returned to Philadelphia in July for surgery to
replace an arthritic knee. Officials at Pennsylvania Hospital said
her surgery was without complications and her recovery was normal.
   She was staying at a hotel with her husband, jazz drummer Louis
Bellson Jr., to undergo physical therapy and see her two sisters
when she collapsed Friday night.
   She died later at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, said
hospital spokeswoman Kellyann McDonnell. The cause of death wasn't
known and an autopsy was planned. She had a history of heart
ailments.
   Bellson said Bailey was sewing a piece of needlepoint for one of
her doctors when she said something was wrong with her hands. He
said she asked him to call her doctor and the paramedics.
   Then, he said, ``the kind of look you never want to see''
crossed her face and she slumped in her chair, Bellson told the
Philadelphia Daily News.
   ``I just lost my best friend,'' he said.
   Bellson said that although everyone was devastated by the death,
it was important not retreat into a shell.
   ``It will be hard, but you just have to try and adjust to a new
life. You have to keep on going while you're living, '' he said.
``I know Pearl would have wanted me to forge ahead and do what I
want to do.''
   Bailey had returned to Philadelphia for knee surgery at the
recommendation of her friend, publisher Walter H. Annenberg, former
U.S. ambassador to Britain.
   Annenberg told The Philadelphia Inquirer that the singer was in
``great spirits'' when he saw her after the surgery.
   ``She was dancing around the room to show me how successful it
was,'' he said. ``She wanted to get back to her work at the United
Nations.''
   In 1970, President Nixon named her America's ``ambassador of
love'' to the world. She was a special delegate to the United
Nations under the Ford, Reagan and Bush administrations.
   ``Pearl Bailey was the mother of the world,'' said Stan Irwin,
her manager for 25 years. ``She was a very spiritual woman and she
never recognized color. Her ideology was, `We are humans.'''
   Songwriter Sammy Cahn said Bailey was unique.
   ``She came as advertised. When you said Pearl Bailey, it was a
spirit, a talent,'' he said.
   Bailey's direct and forthright manner carried over to her
throwaway style of singing.
   ``I'm more of a philosopher than a jazz singer,'' she said in a
June interview with The New York Times. ``When people say, `Pearl,
where did you get your style?' I tell them: `I have no style. I
just sing songs.'''
   On Broadway, she appeared in ``House of Flowers'' and ``Bless
You All,'' and enjoyed a long film career, with her movies
including ``Carmen Jones'' and ``Porgy and Bess.''
   The entertainer also wrote humorous and inspirational books,
including ``Raw Pearl,'' ``Talking to Myself'' and ``Between You
and Me.''
   Born in Newport News, Va., on March 29, 1918, she was the
daughter of a minister and the youngest of four children.
   She moved with her family as a child to Washington and later to
Philadelphia. In 1979, she moved from California with her husband
of 38 years to the Arizona resort community of Lake Havasu City in
1979.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete Saturday night. Smith,
Bailey's road manager, said she would be buried in Philadelphia,
near family members, Wednesday or Thursday.
   She also is survived by a son, Tony, and a daughter, Dee Dee.

   War bands battled with axes, spears
and knives and ritually mutilated the bodies of their enemies
Saturday as the death toll from a week of tribal fighting rose to
at least 222. Hundreds were injured.
   Fighting flared in parts of Soweto and Tokoza townships when
large groups of heavily armed Xhosas tried to attack hostels
housing migrant Zulu workers.
   Zulus fought back with guns and sharp-edged weapons and went on
a rampage in Tokoza, driving off the attackers.
   ``We were just drinking and being happy,'' said a Zulu called
Steven, who was armed with two spears and a cowhide shield. ``They
came to kill us. They want to drive us out, but we will kill them.''
   The government ordered troops into the townships to support
police in trying to halt the fighting. Police and soldiers in
armored vehicles fired tear gas and shotguns to break up clashes.
Lines of police vehicles drove between rival groups to keep them
apart.
   The fighting appeared to have developed primarily into a tribal
battle. Earlier clashes had pitted Xhosas of the African National
Congress and Zulus of the more conservative Inkatha movement, but
many township residents said people who did not belong to the two
groups were fighting along tribal lines.
   The bloody conflict erupted last Sunday in Tokoza, east of
Johannesburg, and spread during the week to four more areas,
including Soweto, southwest of Johannesburg.
   The fighting is the worst in the townships in years, local press
reports say.
   Police officials said at least 222 people had been killed, but
the toll probably was higher because some bodies had been removed
before police could count them.
   Zulus at Tokoza ritually castrated the bodies of dead Xhosas and
cut off hands, waving the severed parts in victory dances. Zulus
believe mutilation robs enemies of their strength and makes the
victor stronger.
   A mob of about 1,500 Zulus in Tokoza beat their axes and spears
against shields, chanting war cries. Police in armored vehicles
surrounded the fighters to keep them from attacking nearby Xhosa
houses.
   The country's top police official, Gen. Johann Van Der Merwe,
announced the deployment of soldiers and more police.
   ``This strong contingent will do everything possible to stop the
senseless violence,'' he said in a statement. But officials would
give no details on how many troops were being deployed.
   ``We will kill the Xhosas! They are rubbish _ we will kill them
all!'' declared Richard Zulu, leader of a war band.
   Xhosas were demanding that all Zulus leave the townships,
claiming they had no right to live there and should return to their
native Natal Province. They blamed Zulus for starting the fighting.
   A terrified Xhosa youth armed with several iron bars said, ``We
must protect ourselves or they will kill us.''
   In Soweto, police with assault rifles and shotguns roared
through streets in armored vehicles and trucks. Youths who erected
barricades with rocks and burning car tires were dispersed with
tear gas.
   A Soweto city councillor was killed by a mob outside his house
Saturday, police spokesman Lt. G. Mariemuthoo said. The man,
identified as T.A. Nkina, had his throat slit when he confronted
the crowd with a firearm, the police spokesman said. Black
officials are seen as turncoats who support the white-led
government.
   Also Saturday, thousands of black protesters marched through the
conservative northern Transvaal town of Welkom, and police reported
one marcher injured by a crossbow shot. The march was to protest
high rents and lack of civic services.
   No other incidents were reported as the estimated 5,000 marchers
walked, danced and sang past police roadblocks and vehicles set up
to protect them from threatened violence by right-wing whites.
   Also Saturday, about 20,000 people marched peacefully through
the town of Vereeniging, near Johannesburg, to protest political
violence. The African National Congress and Congress of South
African Trade Unions organized that march.
   The ANC accused the government's security forces of plotting to
use Inkatha to stir up tribal rivalry in the townships around
Johannesburg. More than 5,000 people have died in fighting between
Inkatha and ANC supporters in the eastern Natal province in the
past five years.
   Inkatha President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said ANC supporters
insult and attack Inkatha members, causing conflict.
   Many Zulus involved in the fighting in the townships said they
would not accept the ANC and its leader, Nelson Mandela, as a
future government.
   Mandela has been negotiating with President F.W. de Klerk on
clearing the way for a new constitution to give political power to
South Africa's black majority.

   The Army is asking reserve doctors to work in
military hospitals around the nation to replace active-duty staff
sent to the Middle East, officials said.
   A severe shortage of medical personnel in Army hospitals
prompted the offer, the Los Angeles Times, quoting an unidentified
source in Washington, D.C., reported Saturday.
   The Army asked the reservists to list three hospitals where they
would prefer to work, although officials will not guarantee where
they would be sent.
   By volunteering to work for three months to a year in a U.S.
hospital, the doctors, nurses and other medical workers could avoid
going to the Middle East if President Bush calls up medical
reserves later.
   Army Reserve administrators in Santa Ana, San Bernardino and
Riverside began calling about 120 medical personnel on Thursday,
asking them to decide within 24 hours if they would work at an Army
hospital in the United States.
   ``What we're doing is developing a contingency plan in the event
that the Army medical staff is used up and moved out to the Middle
East,'' said Walter Shelton, staff administrator at the 6252nd Army
Hospital in Ventura, which oversees local medical reserve units.
   Shelton said the response has been positive so far, but he
declined to say how many people have signed up.
   One Orange County nurse, who asked that she not be identified,
said she decided to accept rather than risk being sent overseas
later.
   ``The thought of winding up somewhere far away, far from my
family, is a real fear, and I'm just not sure I'm willing to take
that chance,'' said the nurse, an Army reservist for 17 years.

   The servants at Michelle Tobin-Saud's
four-story house in Kuwait City took care of the children while she
managed her husband's million-dollar health club.
   A few days after Iraq invaded Kuwait, however, the family had to
abandon everything but the Chrysler New Yorker they drove across
the burning Sahara to Saudi Arabia.
   Tobin-Saud is back in the United States now with her three
children, building a much more ordinary life after three years in
the Persian Gulf.
   She plans to enroll the children, ages 2, 5 and 7, in
Lansing-area public schools and wants to earn a teaching degree
from Michigan State University.
   Her Kuwaiti husband, Jawad Saud, remains in Saudi Arabia but
plans to rejoin the family.
   ``Kuwait was a paradise on earth,'' she said during an interview
at her mother's apartment Friday in East Lansing. ``I was living
like the cream of the cream. I was like an American princess.''
   Tobin-Saud met her husband, a former Olympic gymnast, in 1981 at
Michigan State University. They lived in the Lansing area for six
years before moving to Kuwait, where he became a lieutenant colonel
in the Kuwait City police academy, she said.
   Shortly after the Aug. 2 invasion, the family learned that Iraqi
soldiers had the addresses of Saud and other Kuwaiti military
personnel, she said.
   Two days later, she and her husband put their children in the
car and left their luxurious home, spending a few days sleeping at
different relatives' houses.
   ``When you go to bed at night, you think, `Should I sleep in the
basement because of bombs, or should we sleep on the roof because
of gas?''' she said.
   A week after that, running short on food and with the fighting
still raging, the Sauds and about 15 other families decided to head
for Saudi Arabia on a narrow, pebble-paved road. A wrong turn sent
some of the vehicles into a sand pit.
   ``It must have been 140 degrees,'' Tobin-Saud said. ``The men
couldn't push the cars because the sand burned through their
shoes.''
   A nomad happened along in a truck that he used to free the
sinking vehicles. They reached the Saudi capital, Riyadh, after
more than 24 hours of travel, she said.

<HEAD>East Germany Helped Iraq's Chemical Warfare Program, Magazine Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany helped Iraq develop a
secret training ground for chemical warfare, a West German magazine
reported Saturday.
   The Hamburg-based Spiegel magazine said East German army
officers supervised construction of a training field that could be
used for chemical, biological and atomic weapons.
   A training ground in East Germany was used as a model for
building the top- secret Iraqi facility, Spiegel said in an advance
copy of the magazine that will go on sale Monday.
   The magazine quoted an East German military officer as saying
that Iraqi officers traveled to East Germany for consultations, but
that East Germany had not delivered chemical weapons.
   In a separate development, West German police on Friday arrested
seven men in connection with the alleged delivery of a poison gas
plant to Iraq several years ago.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has used chemical weapons in the
past, both in the Iran-Iraq war and against Kurds in his own
country. Officials in his government have threatened to use them
against U.S. forces massing in Saudi Arabia.
   West German companies were involved in developing a suspected
Libyan chemical weapons plant.
   In June, Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen, head of the
Imhausen-Chemie company, was found guilty of shipping materials for
an alleged chemical weapons plant in Libya. He was sentenced to
five years in prison.
   Prosecutors said earlier this month that Imhausen may have
supplied plans for a second chemical weapons facility in Libya.

   President Bush signed a $882 million
AIDS emergency bill Saturday that for the first time will allow
direct federal grants to 16 cities hit hardest by the deadly viral
epidemic.
   Bush affixed his signature without public comment to the Ryan
White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act, named for the
Indiana teenager widely admired for his courage in face of the
disease that claimed his life in April.
   Congress will still have to pass a separate appropriations bill
before any of the funds are distributed to states and cities. But
it is the first law ever enacted to provide health grants to states
and localities to fight a specific disease.
   AIDS is spread through the exchange of blood or body fluids or
through contaminated needles. It has killed more than 83,000
Americans in the past decade, and an estimated 1.5 million
Americans are believed to be carriers of the virus.
   Many of the victims have been homosexual or intravenous drug
abusers. Children can contract the disease in the womb or through
blood transfusions, as did Ryan White, a hemophiliac.
   The measure authorizes $882 million for fiscal 1991 and a total
of $4.5 billion over five years.
   It would provide $275 million in health care service grants in
fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1, to 16 major cities. They are:
   Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Fort Lauderdale, Houston,
Jersey City, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Newark, Philadelphia,
San Diego, San Francisco, San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Washington,
D.C.
   To qualify, a city had to have at least 2,000 AIDS cases to date
or a rate of 25 per 10,000 residents. The money will be allocated
based on severity of need.
   States would also get formula grants to improve the delivery of
health care services for people with AIDS. There would be separate
grants to states and health care organizations for AIDS prevention
efforts.

   About 30 people demonstrated Saturday outside

   ``Bush wants another war, we say no,'' the protesters chanted

   Jerry Gorden, a spokesman for the Committee Against U.S. War in
the Persian Gulf, said U.S. involvement in the region served the
interests of oil companies and the wealthy.
   ``Exxon, Texaco, Gulf, Chevron and Mobil, that's who we're
fighting for,'' he said. ``This whole thing is not about freedom,
or protecting one country that was attacked by another, it's about
oil. ... We don't want to shed a single drop of blood for oil.''

<TEXT>
   Treasure hunters who have spent nearly five years
dodging storms and pirates around the Bahamas say they finally may
be on the trail of the ``mother lode'' from a sunken 17th century
galleon.
   In the past few weeks, the crew of the Research Vessel Beacon
have found dozens of valuable artifacts from the Spanish ship
``Nuestra Senora de las Maravillas,'' which was carrying a cargo
worth $1.6 billion.
   Meanwhile, at another wreck site off the Florida coast, five
rare gold ingots raised last week are part of the first big haul
from what is believed to be a treasure-laden Spanish galleon from a
1622 fleet.
   The gleaming ``finger ingots,'' each weighing 1{ pounds, 11
silver coins, 15 ceramic containers, a pair of brass sextons and an
emerald ring were among the treasures displayed Saturday. They were
discovered during the first two weeks of intensive searching of the
1,500-foot-deep site using a remote-controlled robot.
   ``We've literally just scratched the surface of the wreck
site,'' said Dan Bagley, a director of Seahawk Deep Ocean
Technology, the company recovering the nameless wreck, which is
about 25 miles south of the Dry Tortugas, west of Key West.
   In the Maravillas project, one investor said the latest
discovery makes the long search worthwhile. Among the treasures
recovered so far are nearly 80 gold coins, ivory daggers and a gold
brooch decorated with 80 emeralds matching a similar piece found
two years ago.
   ``The thrilling nature of this business certainly hits home when
you get to hold an item that has been on the ocean floor for almost
335 years,'' said Gary Skeen.
   Project spokeswoman Corey Carlson said the crew made the
discoveries in a previously unexplored area about 60 miles east of
West Palm Beach. Team leaders believe they may be closing in on the
main cargo from the Maravillas, which sunk in 1656 after colliding
with another vessel.
   Items from the ship have been found since 1985, but the recent
discoveries are the most valuable.
   ``We've been teased and teased for years,'' she said. ``It looks
like we may finally hit the mother lode.''
   Crew members speak in code on the radio and keep ``a small
arsenal'' on board to guard against pirates, she said.
   ``We've seen boats anchored off the horizon and it's kind of
suspicious,'' said Ms. Carlson. ``Pirates still exist and you have
to be very careful.''
   The treasures from the Maravillas are stored in a vault in
Freeport, Bahamas.
   The Maravillas was carrying a cargo, valued at $1.6 billion in
current prices, which could include artifacts such as a life-size
Madonna and child of solid gold, said Beacon owner Herbert
Humphreys Jr. of Memphis, Tenn.
   Some of the artifacts will be auctioned off in London on Oct. 3,
he said.
   The project is funded by Humphreys' company, Marine
Archaeological Recovery of the Cayman Islands, and Maritime Capital
Group, headed by Jim Kollar and Skeen.
   The Bahamian government receives 25 percent of profits made from
sales of the Maravillas artifacts.

<HEAD>Blacks Wait Longer Than Whites For Organ, Newspaper Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black patients wait an average of five months
longer than whites for kidney transplants, a newpaper investigation
has found.
   The federal government is investigating the disparity, which
stems partly from the fact that most donor organs come from whites,
The Pittsburg Press reported Sunday. Because of slight racial
differences in blood type and antigens, donor organs are more
likely to match those of the same race.
   Based on a review of 13,888 kidney transplants nationwide in
1988 and 1989, the newspaper found that black patients spent an
average 14 months waiting for an organ. On average, white patients
waited slightly less than nine months.
   The study included only transplants using organs from brain-dead
donors, not living relatives. Whites accounted for 3,144 of the
3,802 kidneys donated last year in the United States, the newspaper
said.
   It cited data from the United Network for Organ Sharing, of
Richmond, Va., which has a government contract to control the
national Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.
   ``We are very concerned about this variance, but we do, and have
always, taken every possible safeguard to ensure that race never is
an issue in the fair allocation of organs,'' said Dr. James Wolf,
UNOS president and director of the kidney transplant program at
Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago.
   Because most kidneys come from white donors, characteristics of
the white population appear more often in the donor pool.
   The pattern of blood types and antigens varies slightly among
races, and hospitals always try to match donor to recipient as
closely as possible to avoid rejection of a transplanted organ.
   The newspaper said its study corresponds to preliminary data
developed during an investigation by the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services. Although the report is not expected to be
released until December, HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan has referred
to the findings in speeches this month.
   Sullivan said the government report will show ``blacks were
waiting twice as long as whites ... and these differences remain
even when blood type, age, immunological and locational factors are
taken into account.''
   Details of the HHS investigation are incomplete, but it would
call for a close inspection of the differences in waiting times
that occur in the 230 hospitals doing kidney transplants
nationwide, said Linda Sheaffer, director of the federal Office of
Organ Transplantation.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's chief of protocol,
traveling in the United States with Mikhail Gorbachev in June,
remained behind for several weeks to treat a heart condition, a
hospital said Sunday.
   Vladimir Shermyshev, 61, was admitted to Merritt Peralta Medical
Center on June 11, discharged two days later and remained in the
San Francisco Bay area for about two weeks before returning to the
U.S.S.R., a hospital spokeswoman said.
   The hospital did not announce Shermyshev's stay at the time
because of ``security reasons,'' said spokeswoman Gerrie Shields.
   Shermyshev, who arrived in the Bay area with Gorbachev's
entourage on June 3, had been advised by his doctors to have heart
bypass surgery. He sought a second opinion from Dr. Nilas Young, a
heart surgeon at Merritt Peralta.
   Young was known to Soviet doctors for his involvement in a
program by local doctors to help set up a children's cardiac center
in Leningrad. Soviet doctors currently are incapable of surgery on
children born with heart conditions.
   Shermyshev underwent cardiac catheterization, a testing
procedure in which dye is fed into the arteries, and doctors here
decided he didn't need surgery, Shields said.
   She said she believed Shermyshev stayed at the residence of the
Soviet consul general in San Francisco when he wasn't in the
hospital.
   Calls to the consul Saturday were not answered.

of Westerners barred from leaving Iraq and occupied Kuwait, as Iraq
said it had begun moving some of them to ``strategic'' locations
around the country.
   Thomas R. Pickering, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
said later Saturday that Iraq's actions make it clear that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein is ``going to hold hostage all
foreigners.''
   U.S. officials had previously avoided using the word ``hostage''
to refer to the Americans and other foreigners trapped in Iraq and
Kuwait.
   Iraq said Friday it was detaining citizens of ``aggressive
countries'' and placing them in areas that would be likely targets
in the event of a U.S. attack.
   On Saturday, Iraq also said the foreigners would suffer any
shortages along with Iraqis. It singled out children and the
elderly, saying they would endure hardship along with Iraqis.
   ``Because of the embargo, food cannot be secured for aged
persons in the manner that we wish,'' the statement said. ``If
there were to be any reduction in the necessities of babies, then
the same calamity affecting the Iraqi newborn will affect similarly
the foreign babies,'' said an official statement read on Iraqi
television.
   Meanwhile, the exodus of foreigers, mostly Arabs, continued from
Kuwait and Iraq. At the Jordanian border post of Ruweishid,
officials reported that tens of thousands of Arabs were fleeing
into Jordan from Iraq and Kuwait.
   One official there said 8,100 foreigners had crossed into Jordan
by Saturday evening. He said those who had crossed were all Arab
nationals, mainly Egyptians, except for 425 Poles and two Indians
with British passports.
   Officials said a record 22,300 foreigners crossed the previous
day. This was the largest number since the exodus began following
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The White House said Iraq's holding American and other foreign
citizens is ``totally unacceptable,'' and denounced the use of
``innocent civilians as pawns'' in Saddam's stand against
international sanctions.
   Anxiety grew following the overnight announcement by Iraq's
parliamentary speaker, Sadi Mahdi Saleh, that foreigners from
``aggressive nations'' would be kept in Iraq as long as the threat
of war persisted. Mahdi said they would be housed in civilian and
military institutions throughout Iraq.
   In an interview Saturday with Britain's Independent Television
News, Iraqi Ambassador to France Abdul Razzak al-Hachimi said in
Paris: ``Some of them ... have been distributed in strategic
installations in Iraq starting all the way from north of Iraq to
the south.''
   The British Foreign Office said later it had confirmed that 40
Britons, five Americans, four Germans and one French citizen had
been moved from Kuwaiti hotels to undisclosed locations. A
department spokesman said Iraq had said the foreigners would get
VIP treatment.
   On Saturday, Iraq also called the economic embargo imposed on it
by the U.N. Security Council an ``act of war,'' and said the
foreigners it holds will suffer along with Iraqis if shortages of
food and medicine develop.
   Iraq imports about three-quarters of its food.
   The Baghdad government holds 3,000 Americans, 4,000 Britons and
about 14,000 other Westerners among the more than 2 million
foreigners caught in Iraq and Kuwait when Iraq invaded the small
oil state.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization said Saturday in Tunisia
that PLO chief Yasser Arafat had received ``formal assurances''
that foreigners would be safe and well treated. But it was not
clear if that meant all foreigners or only Palestinians, nor was it
clear who made the assurances.
   Britain called Iraq's threat to detain Westerners ``unlawful and
inhuman'' and said it would not be deterred from helping defend
Persian Gulf states against Iraqi aggression.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said the Iraqi ambassador was
called in ``to underline our grave concern and to relay to his
authorities the need for immediate clarification.''
   A West German Foreign Ministry spokesman said in Bonn Saturday
his government felt ``great anxiety'' over the fate of 1,000 West
German citizens in Iraq and Kuwait after Iraq said it would not let
foreigners leave.
   In Paris, France summoned the Iraqi ambassador to warn that
``serious consequences'' would result if steps are not taken to
protect the 560 French nationals in Iraq and Kuwait.
   No orders were given for French people in Kuwait to assemble at
hotels, as were given on Thursday for Americans and British, a
French source said.
   The Iraqi restrictions did not appear to refer to Soviet
citizens.
   A group of 225 Soviet citizens from Kuwait were among the
thousands who crossed into Jordan on Friday. The group was driven
straight from the border to Amman's airport early Saturday and
boarded a plane that left for Moscow.
   Italian newspapers said Saturday that more than 300 Italians in
Iraq say they are being held against their will and appealed for
help from Italy. Italy's state-run TV reported Saturday all the
stranded Italians appeared safe and were free to move about in
Baghdad and Kuwait City.
   Many foreigners _ Arabs and a few Westerners _ were fleeing
across the Saudi border.
   Mohamed Al-Mashat, Iraq's ambassador in Washington, said in a
CNN TV interview Saturday that all foreign nationals were ``safe
and well-treated.''
   ``I would protest the use of the term hostage,'' he said in
response to a question. ``We call them our guests. ... The lives of
Iraqis and foreigners are equal. Where is the humanitarian thing
when you deny our children and babies the milk for their
nourishment and livelihood?''
   He likened Iraq's action to U.S. internment of Japanese
descendants in World War II: ``It is a temporary measure because we
are in a crisis.''

   Waters subsided Saturday night after
authorities opened the floodgates of a reinforced dam, but about
700 worried residents stayed away from their homes.
   They were among about 1,500 people evacuated earlier from 1,000
homes as flood waters threatened to rupture the Lake Tomah Dam on
the Lemonweir River.
   The dam was reinforced with about 20,000 sandbags and its
reservoir dropped eight inches by Saturday night after the
floodgates were opened, said Tom Flock, fire chief of this central
Wisconsin town.
   ``If we do get a downpour now, it should be able to hold it,''
he said.
   Dams down river at New Lisbon, Mauston and Lemonweir Mills would
be endangered if the Tomah dam collapsed.
   Residents left their homes in Tomah after the city of about
7,000 received about eight inches of rain during a three-hour
period Friday night, said Carleen Pearson of the Monroe County
Police Department.
   About 300 were taken to a junior high school gymnasium, she said.
   Rain in the area stopped at about 6 a.m. but was expected to
resume late Saturday into Sunday, said National Weather Service
meteorologist Tom Helman.
   Early Saturday afternoon, water was flowing over the dam, said
Tomah Alderman Wayne Johnson said.
   No deaths or injuries were reported in Tomah. No damage estimate
was available.
   Tomah police Capt. Don Larson said the city's storm sewers
couldn't handle all the extra water, and sewage backed up into
several homes. The rains left the city in ``a mess,'' said
Assistant Fire Chief Stu Westphall.
   A wing of Tomah Memorial Hospital was damaged by flooding, but
no patients were endangered, officials said.
   The city's ambulance service, civil defense and police
department all were involved in the evacuation, said Donette Gorbet
of the Tomah Police.
   ``It's chaotic,'' she said. ``We're telling everybody to stay
away from Tomah.''
   Roads in central and southern Wisconsin flooded early in the
day, with water forcing cars off the roads, officials said.
   A 25- to 30-mile stretch of state Highway 12-16 and parts of the
15-mile stretch of Interstate 90 between Oakdale and Sparta were
closed, Ms. Pearson said.
   Other Wisconsin cities that got heavy rain in the 24 hours
ending Saturday morning included Cobb, 5.5 inches; Eau Claire, 2.57
inches; Milwaukee, 2.18 inches; Wausau, 1.16 inches.

   Salvadoran rebels on Saturday
accused President Alfredo Cristiani of involvement in the murder of
six Jesuit priests.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front proposed a new
commission be formed to oversee the murder investigation.
   The accusations were made in a letter released to reporters
during a fourth round of talks between the government and the
rebels aimed at achieving a cease-fire in El Salvador's civil war.
   The discussions were to center on rebel demands to reduce the
size of the army and purge officers accused of human rights abuses,
including the Jesuit killings. The rebels also have called for
immediate U.N. monitoring of human rights in the country.
   The government has not yet responded to the rebel demand to give
the United Nations such authority. Government officials have said
discussions on the size of the army and a purge of officers should
come only after a cease-fire.
   The 10-year civil war has cost more than 72,000 lives, most of
them civilian.
   U.N. mediator Alvaro De Soto told reporters in San Jose that
substantial progress could be made during the current round of
talks, but he said the United Nations could not form a human rights
verification commission immediately.
   ``A series of practical problems exists for installing the U.N.
verification commission. ... While the required conditions aren't
there, we prefer not to do it,'' De Soto said, without elaborating
further.
   The six-day round of talks are scheduled to run through
Wednesday.
   In the letter addressed to Cristiani, the rebels proposed a
joint government-rebel commission to monitor legal proceedings in
the Jesuit murder case and report its findings to both peace
negotiators and the public.
   It said the fact the president acknowledged authorizing an army
search of the priests' house before the slayings implicated him in
the killings.
   Cristiani has acknowledged authorizing the search of the
priests' home, but said it was considered standard procedure. The
search took place three days before the killings and came during a
major rebel offensive in San Salvador.
   The six Jesuits, their housekeeper and her daughter were
murdered on Nov. 16 at the University of Central America in San
Salvador. Nine military men, including a colonel, were charged in
connection with the killings, but none has come to trial.
   The letter said an application to search the priests' house
reached Cristiani ``at the moment that the radio and television
network of your government said that Father Ignacio Ellacuria
should be eliminated.''
   It said the search authorization ``implicitly defined him and
his Jesuit companions as enemies to be eliminated.''
   The rebels charged that the government's sluggishness in
prosecuting the accused officers ``is reaffirming and reinforcing
the impunity of the armed forces.''
   The FMLN letter accused the army of promoting and preventing
prosecution of senior military officers implicated in the slayings
_ accusations which have also been made by some members of the U.S.
Congress.
   The meetings, which began Friday at a San Jose hotel, were the
fourth in a series aimed at ending the war.
   The previous round last month, also held in San Jose, led to a
partial agreement on human rights. It gives the United Nations
authority to monitor human rights in the country following a
cease-fire.

   A self-taught engineer, Wing invented the ``Hi-Shear Rivet''
first used in the P-51 Mustang, the workhorse World War II fighter
plane. The rivet was one-third lighter than previous fasteners and
has since been used on all types of commercial and military
aircraft, as well as NASA's Apollo missions to the moon.
   A native of Kewanee, Wis., he worked at several aviation
companies, designing the fastener while at North American Aviation.
In 1943, he left to found the company that became Hi-Shear Corp. in
the Los Angeles suburb of Torrance, a maker of fasteners, explosive
separation devices, boosters and rivet-making tools.
   Wing died at Torrance Medical Center after a brief battle with

   The Times Publishing Co. settled a
stock feud with Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass that company
officials said Friday preserved independent control of the St.
Petersburg Times.
   The publishing company agreed to recapitalization, including
redemption of its preferred stock, the parties announced in a joint
statement. In return the Bass group is dismissing its suit against
the Times.
   ``The agreement assures the long-term independence, journalistic
control and competitive vigor of the St. Petersburg Times, as well
as significant ongoing support for the Poynter Institute,'' said
Andrew Barnes, chairman of Times Publishing.
   David Bonderman, managing partner for the Bass group,
Poynter-Jamison Ventures Ltd., said the settlement was in
everyone's best interest. The partnership includes the nieces of
the late Eleanor Poynter Jamison, sister of founder Nelson Poynter,
who ran the paper for 30 years.
   ``We always believed this to be a good investment and are happy
we could work with Andy Barnes to help end a family dispute that
has brewed for years,'' Bonderman said.
   Earlier this year, the Bass group made a $270 million buyout
offer for Times Publishing Co., parent firm of the newspaper,
Congressional Quarterly and other magazines.
   The Bass group owned 40 percent of the voting stock but got only
5.7 percent of the dividends of Times Publishing Co. under an
unusual stock arrangement.
   The partnership sought a better return on its investment and
maintained directors had an obligation to recall preferred stock,
as allowed by bylaws, at $106 a share or $318,000.
   But the Times defended the stock arrangement as beneficial to
the journalistic standards of the newspaper and the health of the
Poynter Institute, which essentially controls the newspaper. The
institute offers education and national conferences to journalists
and students.
   As a result of the settlement the publishing company is
incurring debt, said Barnes, who is editor and president of the
Times. The debt should not affect operations, said Barnes. who also
is chairman of the Poynter Institute and chief executive officer of
the Times Holding Co. as well as Times Publishing.
   Nelson Poynter, who ran the paper for 30 years, had set up a
unique way to keep a profitable daily newspaper in the hands of
journalists, free from control of outsiders or even his family. He
established the not-for-profit journalism school, which ultimately
is the major stockholder of the newspaper.
   Times Publishing is owned largely by Times Holding Co., which in
turn is owned almost entirely by the non-profit Poynter Institute
for Media Studies.
   State Attorney General Bob Butterworth had intervened in the
suit on behalf of the Poynter Institute, which he said was
threatened by the Bass partnership.
   Butterworth said he was pleased with the settlement, but
disturbed by the agreement by the parties not to comment on terms
or related matters.
   ``This office will take whatever steps are available to ensure
that the state has sufficient information to determine that the
settlement, in fact does not have an adverse impact on the Poynter
Institute's beneficiaries, including the state university system
and Tampa Bay-area public schools,'' he said.

<HEAD>Nike Execs Say Reebok Using PUSH</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. CRUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top executives of Nike Inc. said Friday
their chief competitor, Reebok International Ltd., was using
Operation PUSH to try to gain an advantage in the hotly competitive
athletic shoe market.
   Operation PUSH, a civil rights organization founded in Chicago
by Jesse Jackson, called last Saturday for a boycott of Nike
products. PUSH said it was dissatisfied with Nike's record in
hiring and doing business with blacks.
   At a news conference, Nike chairman Philip H. Knight and
president Richard K. Donahue said Nike would hold no more meetings
with PUSH to discuss the subject.
   ``PUSH is being manipulated by Reebok to the advantage of Reebok
and to the disadvantage of PUSH,'' Donahue said.
   Knight said the boycott had not affected Nike's business.
   ``Our dispute is not with the black community, it is with
PUSH,'' he said.
   Reebok executives did not return calls Friday.
   A woman at PUSH headquarters in Chicago answered the telephone
with the admonition, ``Say No to Nike.'' Two separate requests for
comment were relayed to the executive offices, but the calls were
not returned Friday.
   Nike, based in the Portland suburb Beaverton, made $243 million
last year on sales of $2.2 billion. Reebok made $175 million on
sales of $1.8 billion.
   Operation PUSH says blacks comprise 30 percent of the market for
Nike's shoes and should got more jobs and business from the company.
   In the past, PUSH has gotten signed ``covenants'' calling for
greater opportunity for blacks from companies including Coca Cola
and Burger King.
   The two executives said 21 percent of the Nike employees hired
in the United States since January have been minorities.
   They refused to break down that figure to show the role blacks
play at Nike. Donahue said that would divert the public focus from
Nike's efforts to build a culturally diverse company.
   ``I think it is wrong to target and focus on one segment of the
minority community,'' he said.
   Nike's goals include naming a minority to the board of directors
within a year and a minority vice president within two years, the
executives said.
   Nike was the first sneaker company targeted because it is the
biggest. But Donahue said Reebok was excluded from PUSH's
questionnaires to athletic shoe companies.
   Nike began providing information to PUSH last month but abruptly
stopped after finding that Reebok had purchased an ad in a PUSH
magazine, he said. Nike asked PUSH for information on its
relationship with Reebok, he said.
   ``The response was outrage,'' Donahue said.
   Nike uses prominent blacks in its television advertising
campaigns.
   Football and baseball star Bo Jackson, basketball star David
Robinson and Georgetown basketball coach John Thompson are featured
in a current series of Nike ads urging young people to stay in
school and stay away from drugs.
   Donahue said several Nike stars, including basketball player
Michael Jordan, had issued statements supporting Nike in the face
of the boycott.
   A spokeswoman in New York for filmmaker Spike Lee, who appears
in Nike ads, said Lee had no comment.

   Salvadoran guerrillas entering a new
round of peace talks with the government said Friday they have a
new plan to overcome differences over the future of the armed
forces.
   Representatives of the Salvadoran government and the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front were to meet Friday evening for the
fourth round in a current series of talks aimed at ending El
Salvador's civil war.
   ``We bring a new proposal which develops, broadens and specifies
what we presented earlier on the theme of the armed forces,'' said
Schafik Handal, one of the rebel negotiators.
   ``The subject of restructuring the armed forces will be the
principal point of this meeting,'' said rebel spokesman Miguel
Saenz.
   He said the front is demanding that the army disband its elite
U.S.-trained Atlacatl Battalion ``because it is one of those that
have committed the most massacres of the people.''
   The battalion was the first Salvadoran unit to be trained by the
United States, which supports the government and armed forces of
President Alfredo Cristiani with about $1 million per day in aid.
   Rebels and government negotiators earlier agreed to try for a
cease-fire in September. But the government has balked at rebel
proposals for trimming the armed forces and purging officers
implicated in human rights abuses.
   At least 72,000 people, most of them civilians, have been killed
in the 10-year-old war between the leftist FMLN guerrillas and the
Salvadoran military. Many of the victims were killed by right-wing
death squads with ties to the military and Cristiani's ARENA party.
   The third round of talks last month in San Jose led to a partial
pact on human rights and a separate agreement to let a United
Nations commission monitor human rights after a cease-fire.
   The army currently has 54,000 soldiers.

   Jurors in the Central Park jogger case ended
their ninth day of deliberations Friday without a verdict.
   Jurors heard testimony read back to them about a ring of fire
that some witnesses reported seeing in the park on the night of the
attack. Its relevance to the trial was unclear.
   The jury also reviewed a videotaped statement Antron McCray made
to police. In it, McCray said he kicked the victim and feigned sex
with her.
   Two police officers testified that they saw the ring of fire in
the same area and at about the same time the woman jogger was
attacked April 19, 1989.
   Defendant Yusef Salaam, the only one of the three defendants to
take the stand, also testified that he saw the fire.
   Justice Thomas Galligan excused the jurors Friday night and told
them to resume deliberations late Saturday morning.
   Also Friday, Galligan denied a defense motion for a mistrial.
Michael Joseph, McCray's attorney, said he sought the mistrial
because he did not want the jurors to reach a verdict while they
were tired.
   Earlier in the day, the jury finished hearing testimony read
back to them from McCray's parents, Bobby and Linda McCray.
   Bobby McCray testified he told his son to confess to crimes he
did not commit in the hope that police would then let the teen-ager
go free.
   Linda McCray said police investigators yelled at her son to
coerce a confession.
   McCray, 16, Salaam, 16 and Raymond Santana, 15, are accused of
raping and trying to kill a jogger on her nightly run in Central
Park.
   The jogger eventually recovered and returned to her job as a
Wall Street investment banker. She testified that she suffers from
impaired balance, vision and smell as a result of the attack and
cannot recall what happened that night.

Department said the four groups making the estimates are still
working out differences. The revised figure would be ready by Sept.
7, the department said.
   In a letter to Rep. Robert Roe, D-N.J., chairman of the House
Science, Space and Technology Committee, Deputy Energy Secretary
Henson Moore said the ``reconciliation process is still under
way.'' He gave no more explanation.
   On July 25, Moore said the four groups would try to have a final
figure Aug. 17.

   Six months after Soviet tanks
began rolling out, the Rolling Stones have rolled in, marking a
high point for the new cultural freedom long denied by the
country's ousted Communist rulers.
   The band plays for the first time in Czehoslovakia today at
Prague's Strahov Stadium, listed in the Guiness Book of World
Records as the world's largest, with a capacity for 240,000 people.
   ``It's a great opportunity for us to play to people who could
never hear us before,'' Keith Richards, the band's lead guitarist
said in a documentary aired Thursday on state television.
   Proceeds of the concert will go to the Czechoslovak Children's
Foundation, which benefits handicapped children, Romanian refugees
and victims of the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl, according to
media reports in London. The charity is headed by Olga Havel, wife
of Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel.

   The Soviet Union is facing a crime wave, and it's
turning for help to the city that gave the world ``Scarface'' Al
Capone and the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.
   The Soviets are hunting down the latest in crime-fighting
techniques from lie detectors to fingerprinting networks to
communication systems.
   ``Their interest really kind of shook me up,'' Matt L.
Rodriguez, a deputy superintendent for the Chicago Police

   USAir must let 8,000 employees vote again on
whether to be represented by the Teamsters union, because the first
organizing drive was tainted by illegal anti-union activities, a
federal labor board says.
   The Teamsters had lost their bid to represent workers in a
ballot count announced in January. But the National Mediation Board
ruled Friday that actions by the airline interfered with the
union's organizing campaign.
   The union may request a rerun election within 30 days.
   The Teamsters, who were trying to win the right to represent
8,000 workers who load airplanes at 180 airports around the

   While politicians loudly ask who's to blame
for the savings and loan mess, regulators and analysts are quietly
asking a much more urgent question: Is commercial banking headed
for disaster too?
   ``The answer is yes,'' said economist R. Dan Brumbaugh of
Stanford University. ``We're already there.''
   He believes that more banks would be declared insolvent _ and
the government fund protecting $2.6 trillion in deposits at 12,500
banks would be broke _ if regulators stopped using outmoded
accounting methods to determine when a bank has failed.
   No, said L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., which, through separate funds, guarantees both
bank and thrift deposits up to $100,000 per account.
   ``We will be able ... to handle any failures we can currently
foresee,'' he said. He vigorously disputes Brumbaugh's methodology
and conclusions.
   But from another perspective, the two sides are not far apart.
They are arguing about how bad the condition of the banking system
is, not whether it is in bad or good shape.
   The bank insurance fund is ``in a very much stressed position,''
Seidman conceded at a recent Senate hearing.
   Because bank deposits are nearly triple the $930 billion held by
savings institutions, the bank insurance fund's health has always
been potentially even more critical than the condition of the
now-bankrupt Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
   The funds were established half a century ago to restore
confidence in the nation's financial system after a wave of bank
and S&amp;L failures swept the nation during the Depression, wiping out
the savings of thousands of Americans.
   For decades, both funds thrived, supported by insurance premiums
paid by member institutions. But so many savings and loans failed
during the 1980s that taxpayers had to rescue the S&amp;L fund at a
cost now estimated as high as $500 billion over 40 years _ $2,000
for every man, woman and child in the nation.
   The bank fund has so far been able to handle bank failures,
though the balance has been dropping for three years now. And if it
falls to zero in the 1990s, taxpayers would have to bail out banks,
too.
   The bank fund, which ended 1987 with $18.3 billion, lost $4.24
billion in 1988, when bank failures hit a post-Depression high of
221. That was its first decline ever. When another 207 banks failed
last year, it lost an additional $851 million.
   Failures remain high in 1990 _ 121 through Aug. 16 _ and Seidman
has estimated the fund will lose around $2 billion, reducing it to
near $11 billion.
   A key ratio measuring the fund's health has been deteriorating
even longer. In 1963, the FDIC had $1.50 for every $100 in
deposits. By 1981, that had gradually eroded to $1.24. As failures
soared during the 1980s, the ratio plummeted. After this year's
loss, Seidman estimates it will be between 50 cents and 60 cents.
   Last week, his board proposed emergency action to battle the
decline, preliminarily endorsing a 62-percent increase in the
insurance premium banks pay. It is the maximum increase allowed by
law.
   The move would increase the FDIC's premium income from $2.8
billion in 1990 to $4.8 billion in 1991. Much of the added expense
will be passed on to depositors through higher fees for checking
accounts and other services.
   Analysts, however, say the added income would provide only a
little extra protection for taxpayers should soaring oil prices
trigger a recession and another wave of bank failures.
   ``The wild card right now in all these forecasts is Iraq,'' said
economist Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution, a
Washington-based, liberal think tank.
   ``Clearly, right now the fund is skating on the edge. It is
conceivable that it could get by if the economy escapes a recession
and if oil prices stabilize in the low- to mid-$20s'' a barrel, he
said. ``However, Iraq could change all that.''
   If the recession was deep, bank troubles in the 1990s could
dwarf those of the 1980s, which occurred despite an unprecedented
eight years of expansion in the national economy.
   An additional worry is that bank regulators, like S&amp;L regulators
before them, would be tempted to allow insolvent banks to remain
open. Then, with federal insurance guaranteeing their deposits, the
banks would have every motive to take wild risks. If they win, they
avoid bankruptcy. If they lose, taxpayers pay.
   A few analysts, like Brumbaugh, contend that is already
happening.
   ``The FDIC's behavior is deja vu all over again and it is
irresponsible,'' he said.
   However, others believe that, with the lesson of the S&amp;L mess
still fresh, bank regulators would appeal for taxpayer assistance
much earlier and Congress would respond more quickly.
   Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va.,
who made his reputation with early predictions of disaster for the
savings and loan fund, said comparisons between banks and S&amp;Ls are
overdone.
   ``Banks are fundamentally sounder institutions. ... And,
basically, the FDIC has not been sweeping the problems under the
rug to the extent that the (thrift regulators) were,'' he said.
   The root of the S&amp;L crisis was planted when the institutions
were created. They borrowed deposits short-term and lent the money
long-term to home buyers. When inflation pushed interest rates past
20 percent they had to pay more interest on their deposits than
they were earning on their mortgages.
   Cures applied in the early `80s _ expansion into new lending
areas coupled with lax oversight _ only worsened the problem.
   The roots of banking's woes are different, but still formidable.
   In the 1970s, the nation's largest banks had lent billions of
dollars to Third World countries, who by the 1980s were defaulting.
By the mid-80s, small farm banks began collapsing, along with
agriculture commodity and farm land prices.
   Then came the drop in oil prices, triggering a collapse in real
estate values in the Southwest. Now, real estate problems have
spread to the Northeast and are threatening the Southeast, Southern
California and even a few Midwestern cities.
   Longer-term, innovations in the financial system are eroding
banks' profitability. Their best deposit customers have been lured
to money market mutual funds. Their largest and most credit-worthy
borrowers raise money by issuing commercial paper, a service that
banks are substantially barred from delivering along with other
securities underwriting.
   Banks' defenders point out that the industry earned a record
$24.8 billion in 1988 and a respectable $15.7 billion in 1989.
Critics, however, say that does little to reduce the potential for
disaster.
   Although commercial banks collectively earned $6.2 billion in
the first three months of this year, 10 percent of them lost money
and 1,058 were considered ``problem'' institutions by the FDIC.
   ``Ten percent can easily send you under. Deep under,'' Litan
said. ``The 10 percent of the banks that are unprofitable ... hold
roughly the same assets that the open, but insolvent thrifts held
in the mid-1980s. We saw what they could do.''

<HEAD>American Will to Fight _ Has It Eroded?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY SCHWARTZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1945, America had willpower.
   At a cost of 400,000 lives, with grim determination, it had
waged global war for four years, stopping only when Germany and
Japan were vanquished.
   In 1990, does America have willpower?
   Have 45 years of instant victories _ such as the Dominican
Republic, Grenada and Panama _ and long, divisive wars that ended
in stalemate or defeat _ Korea and Vietnam _ sapped the resolve of
the United States to sustain a fight?
   As Saddam Hussein gains stature as an American bogeyman, and as
the whole of Saudi Arabia becomes an American military base, the
questions no longer are rhetorical.
   Some historians and others suggest that American willpower is
and always was conditional. Given a real reason to fight, Americans
will fight, they say; given a vague purpose and mounting
casualties, they will carp.
   Militarily, the U.S. strategy has been to play for time. The
blockade of Iraq aims to force Saddam to withdraw from Kuwait _
eventually. The troops in Saudi Arabia await an Iraqi invasion that
may never come. And if hostilities do break out, no one expects a
quick resolution; Iraq is not Grenada.
   No one knows whether Americans have the will to support a
lengthy, costly war in the Middle East over oil supplies.
   ``I don't think there's any doubt that if there's a clear and
present danger, if there's a Pearl Harbor, Americans would fight a
20-year war if they had to,'' said James Reston, retired columnist
for The New York Times.
   ``The United States tends to remain at peace or to go to war
wholeheartedly, in a crusade,'' said Robert Maddox, a professor of
history at the Pennsylvania State University.
   ``Americans demand total victory. They want that victory, and
then they want to go about their business,'' he said. ``They are no
good at dragged-out conflicts, without any resolution, no cities
taken.''
   Few American wars have been supported across the board. During
the American Revolution, Tories fled to Canada. During the War of
1812, several New England states threatened to secede. Abraham
Lincoln had to deal with copperheads, as Southern sympathizers were
known in the North.
   The Spanish-American War was short, but the civil war that
followed in the Philippines dragged on, spurring American protests
led by Mark Twain.
   Even the American involvement in World War I, which lasted just
a year and a half, inspired disapproval _ if only in retrospect.
   ``By the 1930s, there was a widespread belief among the American
people that World War I was a mistake. And we won that war,'' said
Tom Smith, director of general social survey at the National
Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.
   The anti-war attitude _ fostered by reports of war profiteering,
and by the sense that the war accomplished nothing _ hindered
Franklin Roosevelt as he tried to bring the United States into
World War II.
   ``Pearl Harbor was an enormously unifying experience,'' said
John Morton Blum, professor at Yale and author of ``V was for
Victory,'' a history of the homefront. ``There was more unity than
in any of the other wars.''
   Still, there are indications war support was not monolithic, at
least when the number of casualties escalated. At the end of 1944,
more than 20 percent of those polled favored striking a deal with
Hitler.
   And in its last year, letters and articles were written decrying
the cost of the war in the Pacific, where battles with the Japanese
on island after island exacted a heavy toll, said Richard Lingeman,
author of the homefront history ``Don't You Know There's a War On?''
   ``People were screaming about it. When they dropped the bomb,
there was some relief, I think,'' said Lingeman.
   In Korea and Vietnam, too, war support declined as casualties
climbed.
   John Mueller, a professor of political science at the University
of Rochester, found that support dropped 15 percent when the number
of casualties increased from 1,000 to 10,000; it dropped another 15
percent when casualties climbed from 10,000 to 100,000.
   The figures for the two wars were identical, though one was
conducted under the United Nations flag and one was not; though one
was thoroughly televised (a factor often blamed for opposition to
the Vietnam War) and one was not.
   Any democracy is likely to face similar obstacles during
wartime, Mueller suggested. But an authoritarian regime, like
Iraq's, may be able quash that kind of opposition, at least for a
while.
   What would inspire Americans to accept casualties over the long
haul?
   Another Pearl Harbor, of course. Identifiable enemies help:
``We've always needed a recognizable foe _ a Kaiser Bill who we
were going to hang from the old apple tree, a Hitler,'' said Penn
State's Maddox. President Bush has taken pains to compare Iraq with
the expansionist Germany of the 1930s.
   Mostly, Americans need a clear and compelling reason.
``Sustained belligerancy with homefront morale is directly related
to purpose,'' said Blum, the World War II historian.
   ``That's what was lacking in Vietnam,'' said Frances FitzGerald,
author of the Vietnam history ``Fire in the Lake.'' ``It had
nothing to do with national willpower.''
   Would a threat to oil inspire such dedication?
   Oil is vital. ``We're not talking about selling some bolts of
calico cloth or cheap trinkets,'' the kind of economic interests
that sparked American shows of force in the 19th century, said
Maddox.
   Still, Lingeman recalled that in the months before Pearl Harbor,
opponents of intervention said they would not go to war for rubber,
a vital commodity that was tied up in the conflict.
   ``The idea of an economic war, I don't think it will take. I
think people would make (economic) sacrifices before they would go
to war,'' he said.
   Reston agreed that barring further provocation, American support
for a war with Iraq would wilt in the burning sun of the Saudi
desert.
   ``Once the shooting starts, the tendency is to rally 'round the
flag. But for a long, long time? No, I don't think so,'' he said.

<HEAD>Housing Price Collapse? Not By the Numbers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the strangest things about the so-called
collapse of housing prices is that you can't detect it in some of
the statistics. It's as if the numbers were added up incorrectly.
   In the second quarter of the year, for instance, the median
selling price of existing single-family houses was 3.4 percent
above the figure for a year earlier _ in defiance, you might say,
of the popular impression.
   And a National Association of Realtors survey of existing-home
sales revealed that second-quarter prices were higher than a year
earlier in 70 of 98 metropolitan areas. In some, the price jumps
were huge.
   Topping the list was the Seattle-Tacoma area, where the
second-quarter median price leaped 35.3 percent over the previous
year; Honolulu, where prices rose 33.2 percent; and Sacramento,
Calif., where the rise was 30 percent.
   Figures such as these prove again that many national averages
and medians are hardly sound guides for measuring local markets.
Unlike stocks and bonds, where prices really are national, real
estate prices are strictly local.
   What happens in Portland, Ore., where the median rose 15.8
percent, has little bearing on what happens in the
Middlesex-Somerset-Hunterdon, N.J., area, where the median price
fell 9.5 percent, steepest in the nation.
   Only one Midwest metropolitan area recorded a decrease, but four
in the West, 10 in the Northeast and 11 in the South posted drops.
Even within states there were differences: New York fell 6.1
percent, Albany rose 2.6 percent.
   What the figures reveal clearly is that there indeed are regions
of extreme price weakness, but that these areas do not merge into a
national collapse, as so often is stated.
   Why, therefore, the sense among homeowners that the marketplace
is a disaster?
   For one thing, excessively high hopes that led many sellers to
overprice. The inevitable price cut that followed might have left
the price higher than a year earlier, but the sense of money lost
remains.
   A lengthening of the time it takes to sell a house contributes
to the feeling of a down market. In some areas of the Northeast the
median selling time is close to 300 days, vs. a few weeks just four
years ago.
   Adding to the feeling of a dead market is the more critical
attitude of buyers. They are more selective, more patient, more
inclined to negotiate than to buy immediately. And, of course,
lenders are tighter than ever.
   For those sellers who can bide their time, the selling delay is
hardly the disaster it is for those who must sell. These are the
sales that provide the anecdotal evidence of a market collapse.
They are not easily forgotten.
   In many communities, for example, real estate agents advertise
that they sold houses within a week after listing, the suggestion
being that they provided the seller with an extra measure of
marketplace expertise.
   Query them and you find that the seller urgently required a
quick sale, and that the listing agent priced the house well below
market. Patient buyers learn a lot about pricing, and often act
quickly when they spot a steal.
   No amount of statistical evidence is likely to dispel the notion
that there has been a national housing price collapse. Too many
people have indeed been hurt financially, and millions of others
are unnerved on hearing about them.
   But so far the national housing disaster you hear so much about
has happened more in the mind than in the numbers.

<HEAD>Japanese Financial Futures To Debut In U.S. At Last</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Chicago's giant commodity exchanges are readying their
long-delayed Japanese financial futures products for a September
launch, but they concede they have no hope of becoming the world
leaders in those markets.
   That distinction belongs to, and will continue to belong to two
Japanese stock exchanges that have been trading futures on the
Nikkei 225 and TOPIX stock indexes for nearly two years and on
Japanese government bonds for even longer.
   The Chicago exchanges say they will settle for being secondary
markets. It is a role to which they are not accustomed but which
will nevertheless reinforce their presence in the global financial
marketplace.
   ``With a Nikkei 225 contract available for trading in North
America, investors in the Japanese stock market will have a means
of protection after their regular trading day ends,'' said John
Geldermann, chairman of the Merc's board of governors.
   On Sept. 25, the Merc will launch its Nikkei 225 futures and
futures-options contracts, followed two days later by the Board of
Trade's introduction of futures and futures-options on the TOPIX
stock index and Japanese government bonds.
   The contracts will give investors, mainly large institutional
investors, more places in which to essentially buy insurance
against losses on Japanese stocks and bonds.
   The Chicago markets are not likely to generate as much volume as
their Japanese counterparts, though, because they will be open for
trading mainly during the U.S. business day, which is nighttime in
Japan.
   Spokesman Michael O'Connell said the Board of Trade also will
list its Japanese products for trading during the exchange's
2{-hour evening session, which corresponds to the opening of the
Japanese trading day.
   Futures on the Nikkei 225, Japan's version of the Dow Jones
industrial average, are traded on the Osaka Securities Exchange.
   The TOPIX is an index based on all 1,100 stocks listed on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, the world's largest. The Tokyo exchange
trades TOPIX futures and Japanese government bond futures.
   The futures are contracts to buy or sell stocks and bonds at
some future date at a price agreed upon in advance. Investors can
use the contracts to offset their risk in the underlying cash
markets or speculate on market movements.
   Strategists at the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange began designing the new products at least five
years ago, at a time when Japanese laws forbade financial futures
trading on Japanese exchanges.
   The Chicago exchanges hoped to capitalize on the situation by
creating their own risk-management tools for Japanese investors as
well as for others who invest in the Japanese financial markets.
   The potential rewards were enormous, as the Chicago exchanges
already had proven with the remarkable success of their U.S.
government bond and stock-index futures.
   Those products transformed the Merc and Board of Trade from
sleepy agricultural commodity markets to world-class financial
exchanges.
   The Chicago exchanges won U.S. regulatory approval for the
contracts in 1988 at about the same time that the Japanese
government relaxed restrictions on such products at home.
   The result was that the Chicago exchanges helped the Japanese
develop their own markets for financial futures in exchange for the
rights to trade those same contracts in the United States.
   O'Connell said the Board of Trade considers it important to
offer the contracts even though the exchange has no expectation of
overtaking the Japanese markets in trading volume.
   ``With the marketplace becoming so international in scope, it
behooves us to compete on the international scene,'' he said.
   O'Connell said the exchange also plans to introduce futures on
various European government bonds.

<HEAD>Uncle Sam Vs. Uncle Saddam Makes Bad Economic Numbers Look Worse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Persian Gulf crisis has combined with
alarming U.S. economic statistics to make even some upbeat
forecasters tilt their outlooks toward the gloomy side.
   Many now believe the Federal Reserve faces an ever more
treacherous minefield in charting a course for U.S. interest rates
over the next several months.
   The key worry is that evidence disclosed this past week on
consumer prices, construction and trade depict an economy leaning
dangerously toward both recession and higher inflation even before
the U.S.-Iraq faceoff in the Gulf, which has sent crude oil prices
skyward.
   ``I think the statistics still point to slow growth, and the
consumer price statistic suggested inflation hasn't been
contained,'' said Marilyn Schaja, economist at Donaldson, Lufkin
and Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York. ``It suggests there was
some kind of pre-Iraq problem.''
   The most troubling figure came from the Labor Department, which
said consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in July, when oil prices were
falling.
   Economists said this means when the full impact of rising oil
prices is felt in August and beyond, inflation could surge toward
an annualized rate of 7 percent or more for 1990.
   That would be the worst in nine years and underscore the growing
U.S. addiction to foreign oil, which now accounts for half the
country's consumption of 17 million barrels a day.
   ``Oil is in every product and the price will be reflected in
every single good,'' said James Chessen, deputy director of policy
development at the American Bankers Association in Washington.
``We'll see a significant rise. I'm pretty worried about that.''
   One of the Federal Reserve's principal jobs is to restrain
inflation through its influence over interest rates, pushing them
up when inflation rises and easing when the economy slows.
   Before the July inflation numbers were revealed, it was widely
assumed that the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's
policymaking arm, would take subtle steps to depress interest rates
at a regular meeting this coming week. But now many economists say
they don't believe that will happen for a while.
   Further complicating the picture is the heavy debt burden the
economy is carrying. Easing interest rates would only add to the
toll being exacted by the budget deficit, the savings &amp; loan
bailout, bankruptcies and high levels of corporate debt.
   ``I think the Fed is in an odd position now,'' Chessen said.
``They don't want to move aggressively to counter the inflationary
effects of the Mideast, yet they worry what it means in the long
term if they don't.''
   Another worrisome statistic of the week was a 2.6 percent
decline in housing starts for July reported by the Commerce
Department, the sixth straight monthly decline in an industry that
many economists say is clearly in a recession and needs a dose of
lower interest rates to revive.
   The Commerce Department also reported the trade deficit for June
dropped to a seven-year low because of record exports. In other
times that might have been good news but instead was seen as an
aberration.
   Economists said the trade report didn't reflect the subsequently
higher price of oil, which is likely to swell the U.S. import bill
and discourage some foreign countries from buying U.S. goods.
   ``These trade numbers were computed when oil was $14-$15 a
barrel,'' said Gary Ciminero, chief economist of Fleet Financial
Group, a Providence, R.I.-based banking company. ``Add at least $10
to that and figure it out.''
   Not all economists viewed the higher price of oil with a sense
of foreboding. Some argued that when priced in 1990 dollars, oil
still remains far below the levels of 10 years ago. Even if oil
remains in the $25-$30 range, they said, oil is only one element of
the inflation picture.
   Others say comparisons to previous oil-price shocks of the `70s
are flawed and misleading, because other forces were at work in
those times, such as sharply higher wages and a rapidly expanding
money supply, which were pushing inflation up relentlessly.
   ``We used to have an economy with a lot of built-in price
pressures, spirals in all sorts of things,'' said Thomas F.
Carpenter, of ASB Capital Management in Washington. ``Those things
are absent. All areas are soft.''
   Still, Carpenter said, oil's rise will permeate the economy with
higher prices. ``You can't get around it.''

<HEAD>Stock Market Follows Middle East, Sending Dow Sliding</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street's obsession with news from the
Middle East has displaced corporate reports and other traditional
signposts of the stock market's direction, sending prices plunging
as optimism wanes.
   The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen 254 points since
Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and stood at 2,644.80 by Friday. The
conflict ended talk of the Dow average breaking 3,000 this year.
   Some analysts don't expect the price slide to stop anytime soon.
   ``Generally, trends tend to go farther than you think they will
go,'' said A.C. Moore, research director at Argus Research Corp.
   The New York investment house believes the Dow average will
touch 2,550 or even lower before the Iraqi situation stabilizes.
   Robert L. Kahan, manager of equity trading at Montgomery
Securities Inc. in San Francisco, said he believes stock prices
will keep dropping ``until something definitive happens'' in the
Mideast.
   ``The market does not like uncertainty,'' he said.
   But not all market watchers are so pessimistic.
   Michael Metz, a managing director of Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said he
believes the Dow average will only drop 20 or 40 points more before
the market enters a recovery.
   ``I would be amazed if the market would close below 2,600 this
year,'' he said. ``It's always the case when everybody says `this
market is going a lot lower and can't possibly go up' _ that's
usually the time it's hitting the bottom.''
   Charles Clough, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co., wouldn't speculate how much farther stock prices may fall, but
said he believes the market is oversold.
   ``You've taken an awful lot out. I would say you've got to rally
at some point here,'' he said. ``You're probably awfully close to
the end of panic selling.''
   At that point, he said, bargain hunters should begin to enter
the market, sending stock prices higher.
   Clough said the Mideast standoff did not set off the stock
market's slide; instead, it only exploited soft market conditions
that already existed. The economic trouble was evident in
disappointing second-quarter corporate earnings released last
month, he said.
   Moore said the market's turmoil reflects an underlying
uncertainty about the world.
   ``We're realizing we don't have a great deal of control over the
future as we seemingly did in the past with the move toward
democracy and free markets,'' he said.
   Moore said he's never seen the market more sensitive to world
events in the 20 years he has worked on Wall Street.
   There is ``lingering optimism'' in the market that the Iraqi
stalemate will be resolved peacefully, but that optimism is
starting to fade, he said.
   In addition, he said, ``You're starting to see more and more
people talk about a probable recession.''
   Should an all-out war erupt in the Mideast, analysts envision
different scenarios for the market.
   Kahan predicted a war would send the Dow climbing because it
finally would be evidence of some definitive action in the region.
   Metz said a war ``would spark a short-term nervous selloff and
then the market would go up.''
   Clough said a conflict would send oil prices even higher as
supply concerns mounted, further destabilizing the market. ``Wars
have never been good for financial markets,'' he said.
   The Mideast upheaval erased 71.78 points from the Dow this week,
a drop of 2.6 percent.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.96 to 180.19
for the week; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market lost 14.54 to 393.49; and the American Stock Exchange market
value index fell 7.71 to 331.61.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 147.95 million shares a day,
down from 181.29 million the week before.
