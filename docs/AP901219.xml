   Victor Bisio doesn't consider himself a fanatic
about music, even if he does own some 10,000 albums and 2,500
compact discs.
   But when he buys CDs, he expects them to live up to their
original slogan - ``perfect sound, forever.'' No pops. No hisses.
No scratches. Music that brings you right in the studio.
   That's why Bisio's massive collection includes a credit slip,
good for three albums, from Columbia Records. The slip arrived last
summer, a few months after he had purchased CDs of Barbra
Streisand's first three records.
   ``There had been mention from Columbia that they couldn't find
the original tapes but they put out the CDs anyway,'' said Bisio, a
recording engineer who lives in Encino, Calif. ``They were are the
worst sounding CDs I ever heard. They were screechy and distorted.
When she hit the high notes, it just shattered your speakers.''
   Compact discs arrived in the mid-1980s, and pushed LPs out of
stores. Since then, Bisio and other collectors have spent long
hours comparing notes and keeping the pressure on record companies.
   Phil Cohen, a Florida collector who owns over 6,000 records,
bought the CD of Jimi Hendrix's ``Electric Ladyland'' three times
before he found a satisfactory copy. Background noise made some
tracks on James Taylor's ``Sweet Baby James'' virtually
unlistenable for another collector.
   Collectors blame CD problems on laziness and greed, insisting
records made from inferior tapes were rushed onto the market and
that songs were shortened or eliminated to fit albums on single
discs. The record companies admit mistakes, but say some problems
were unavoidable in switching from LPs to CDs.
   ``In the beginning, at least, for the people who were asked to
handle it, it took a little bit more understanding of technology
than to just say, `Pull this tape and have it mastered,''' said
Bill Levinson, director of catalog development at PolyGram Records.
   ``We had a handful of records, (Eric Clapton's) `461 Ocean
Boulevard,' that were just not done from correct tapes. The `461'
record was bad enough that we put out a new one, and I told people
in the press that we had done it.''
   Among the worst CDs:
   -Fleetwood Mac's ``Rumours.'' A multiplatinum record originally
released in the mid-1970s, it was pressed by Warner Bros. Records a
decade later from an old production tape and the result was a
muffled, badly distorted CD. A dramatically improved version was
later released.
   -The Jefferson Airplane's ``After Bathing at Baxter's'' was
released in such poor condition that RCA Records apologized,
remastered the tape and offered an exchange.
   Collectors also had complaints about albums by Elton John, Simon
and Garfunkel, Boz Scaggs, Jimmy Buffett, Carly Simon and Yes.
Harry Chapin's ``Verities and Balderdash'' come without the booklet
of photos and lyrics that was included on the LP; Gordon
Lightfoot's ``Gord's Gold'' was minus a song available on the LP.
   ``There are some companies where no one in the music department
makes the decision,'' Levinson said. ``Someone at the managerial
desk says, `These next six ones are for reissue because the
computer says these are the ones to go.' Maybe they're good, maybe
they're not.''
   Artists are beginning to take an active interest. John Arrias,
Streisand's personal engineer, put together remastered versions of
her first three records, which have not yet been released.
Guitarist Jimmy Page was so unhappy with the condition of several
Led Zeppelin CDs released by Atlantic Records he went back to the
studio and helped produce a box set. The Bee Gees consulted with
PolyGram on a recent anthology which collectors say is very good.
   And Columbia, which received the most criticism from collectors,
started Columbia-Legacy Records this year. Legacy has already put
out well-received box sets of blues great Robert Johnson and the
Byrds, made with the assistance of former band member Roger
McGuinn.
   Rich Bauer, product manager of catalog reissues at Legacy, said
he hoped the problems were behind them.
   ``When you try to put together a package from a record that's
20-25 years old, it can be difficult to do everything as well as it
can be done,'' he said. ``There are some records that haven't come
out, such as the first two Jeff Beck records, because of problems
finding the original tapes.''
   PolyGram, one of the first companies to set up its own domestic
plant for producing CDs, received the most praise from collectors.
Rhino Records is also well regarded, especially since it's an
independent label and needs permission from other companies to
acquire master tapes.
   ``We put out a compilation of hits of the 1970s and it was
difficult,'' explained Gary Stewart, vice president of A&amp;R (Artist
and Repertoire) at Rhino. ``Major labels are very professional,
good to deal with. But for independent sources, we have a hard time
tracking them down and making deals, especially companies no longer
in the music business.''
   CDs are digitally mastered (as opposed to analog for LPs), a
concept first tested in France in the 1920s. Digital is thought to
produce a ``cleaner'' sound, with less noise and distortion than
analog.
   Digital recordings (also known as PCM, or Pulse Code Modulation)
were first demonstrated in the late '60s and became available to
the general public in 1972 when Denon released the Mozart Hunting
Suite by the Smetana Quartet.
   PCM recordings were only available on vinyl and cassette until
the '80s when they were issued in the form of a 5-inch ``compact
disc'' developed by Sony and Philips.
   Collectors have few complaints about new albums, but records
made more than 10 years ago create problems. Companies may have a
hard time tracking down the original master and end up using a
second- or third-generation tape. Also, technology has advanced so
rapidly that re-creating sounds produced on old equipment can
require drastic measures.
   ``I recently completed several classical records released in the
1950s and 1960s,'' said Dennis Drake, PolyGram's vice president of
studio and technical operations. ``To transfer this catalog to CD
we had to reconstruct the original machines: a tube tape recorder
and tube console. These machines playing back the masters gave us
the exact sound of the original recordings.''
   Collectors hope the worst is over.
   Pete Howard, publisher and editor of International CD Exchange
(ICE), a monthly newsletter that reviews compact discs, notes that
letters he receives these days deal more with minor compliants -
song length, lyrics, etc.
   Still, hard feelings remain. Collectors have asked record
companies to drop the price of CDs not made from the original
masters, and to label discs to inform the customer whether they've
been remastered from an earlier version.
   ``But the sticker could mean different things,'' said PolyGram's
Levinson. ``The implication of remastering could mean the previous
one was no good, or the previous one might have been good and
you're making it better.
   ``I also wouldn't want to have to put it in the artwork all the
time. It costs more to do that than to do remastering. ...It's a
tough issue of balancing information and consumer needs. Sometimes
the consumer thinks he deserves more than we can give.''

   Army units throughout Chile confined
themselves to their barracks for six hours Wednesday to protest
news reports on an illegal savings and loan organization involving
high-ranking officers.
   Government officials and politicians said the newly restored
democracy in this nation of 13 million residents was not in danger,
and that the army's action was merely ``a military exercise.'' No
incidents were reported.
   Defense Minister Patricio Rojas, emerging for a meeting at
President Patricio Aylwin's private residence, called the military
protest ``a mobilization to test some coordination plans.''
   It was the first episode of military unrest since Aylwin's
government took power nine months ago, ending 16{ year of harsh
rule under Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
   Rojas said the army would issue a communique explaining the
situation shortly.
   Earlier in the evening, Deputy Foreign Minister Belisario Velaso
confirmed there was some unrest in army garrisons, but added, ``The
situation is calm throughout the country.''
   Rojas said the problem arose ``because someone was much too
nervous.'' He denied press reports that the government had demanded
the resignation of Pinochet, the army commander and former military
president.
   Rojas said the government ``fully respects'' the constitutional
clause that allowed Pinochet to remain army commander after handing
over the presidency to Aylwin, an elected civilian.
   The news broke as Aylwin attended graduation ceremonies at the
National Police academy. As he left the academy, Aylwin refused to
talk to reporters.
   Jose Antonio Viera Gallo, president of the House of Deputies,
the lower house of Congress, also confirmed the military action
after talking to Interior Minister Enrique Krauss.
   Viera Gallo said ``public opinion can rest assured that
democratic stability is strong and will continue to be so.''
   Government chief spokesman Enrique Correa said ``the entire
country is happy with the existence of a democratic government.''
   Activity was intense at army headquarters Wednesday night.
Reporters saw scores of men entering headquarters, many in
plainclothes. The men, believed to be army personnel, carried
overnight bags.
   No reports emerged of unrest among other armed branches.
   The military in Latin America has often confined itself to
barracks as a means of expressing protest, but the action is
unusual here.
   The Chilean press has widely reported on the organization for
weeks. Reports surfaced of unrest among army officers for what they
see as a campaign aimed at smearing the army.
   Chile's private TV network, Megavision, said army officers were
``holding private, informal meetings to exchange views about''
media reports on the subject.
   Pinochet earlier Wednesday angrily called the reports on the
organization, known as La Cutufa, ``press fabrications.''
   A special judge investigating the organization, Marcos
Libedinsky, has indicted eight retired army officers for illegal
financial operations. Among them was retired Brig. Gen. Jaime
Lucares, a former chief aide to Pinochet when Pinochet was
president.
   Pinochet himself ordered an internal army probe of La Cutufa,
which, according to press reports that were not denied, resulted in
sanctions on at least 150 officers and non-commissioned officers.
Many were discharged, the reports said.
   Libedinsky said the indicted officers are charged with breaking
the national banking law - in specific taking money for deposit,
then paying interest, which is forbidden for private citizens.
   It is not clear where the name La Cutufa comes from. Some press
reports said it was the name of a dog owned by one of those
involved.
   The last time Chile's military attempted something similar was
in October 1969, when officers barricaded themselves at a Santiago
regiment demanding higher pay for the military.
   In the bloody 1973 coup that brought Pinochet to power, and left
elected President Salvador Allende dead, there was no protest, only
full military action.

   Forsaking internal divisions, religious groups
have begun to form powerful coalitions on issues ranging from
apartheid to pornography. The final part of a four-part series,
``Unholy Wars: Religion in Public Life,'' explores the gulf between
Americans' steady commitment to religion and its absence from many
public policy debates.

   When Nelson Mandela visited New York City this summer, more than
100 religious leaders - Protestant, Jewish, Catholic, Muslim -
gathered to honor him.
   The leaders, who might not have stepped into the same room a few
years earlier, hammered out a statement within a half-hour
condemning apartheid and supporting U.S. sanctions against South
Africa.
   ``It was stupendous,'' said Episcopal Presiding Bishop Edmond
Browning.
   Burger King placed ads espousing family values in newspapers
around the country in November after a coalition of more than 1,600
religious leaders called off a boycott of the company for
sponsoring television programs they said featured sex, profanity
and anti-Christian stereotyping.
   After a generation when they often were engaged in a holy war
with one another, religious groups have started to join forces in
what some say is a culture war for the hearts and minds of a
nation.
   ``There's ... a growing feeling that the forces that are aligned
against the Christian churches - secularism, nationalism,
militarism - are so formidable that we can't help but align
ourselves with one another,'' said Bishop Herbert Chilstrom of the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.
   The National Council of Churches has formed a group, chaired by
Chilstrom, to explore better relations among mainline Protestants,
evangelical Protestants and Catholics.
   By nearly any standard, Americans are among the most religious
people in the world. Eighty-six percent of the respondents to a
November Associated Press poll conducted by the ICR Survey Research
Group said religion is very important or fairly important in their
lives. Sixty-two percent said they had attended a religious service
within the past month.
   And 64 percent said they believe religion can answer all or most
of today's problems.
   ``The great public battle is over culture - how ought we to
live. At the heart of culture are the moral questions,'' said
Richard Neuhaus, director of the Institute on Religion and Public
Life in New York. ``At least in America, for the overwhelming
number of people, the moral questions are inseparable from the
religious questions.''
   But the force that historically tethered the country to a sense
of the common good no longer is first among the nation's political
institutions, as the French historian Alexis de Tocqueville
referred to religion in his landmark study of American democracy in
the 1800s.
   After two decades in which individual liberty has been upheld as
the greatest good, anyone promoting an agenda of justice for all
that would require a common ethical standard - such as a moral
obligation to assist the less fortunate - is having a difficult
time being heard, observers say.
   ``It's doubly hard if you're religious. Your motives are
suspect,'' said philosopher Lisa Newton of Fairfield University.
``If I stand up and say I represent a religion, not only are they
going to ignore me, but they are going to pelt me with tomatoes for
doing something they believe is fundamentally wrong.''
   The buck has become the only common language, said the Rev.
Donald Wildmon, whose American Family Association monitors
television programming for Christian Leaders for Responsible
Television, the coalition that led the Burger King boycott.
   ``I think you're going to see a change in programming, but it's
not one they're going to make willingly,'' Wildmon said. ``It's not
going to be something they want to do. It's going to be something
they have to do.''
   Some worry about the renewed activism of religious groups.
   Consider the sectarian violence in Northern Ireland, India and
the Middle East, and keeping religion at ar's length is not such a
bad idea, those observers say.
   Paul Kurtz, a philosophy professor at the State University of
New York at Buffalo and co-president of the International Humanist
and Ethical Union, said religious involvement in public debate can
lead only to discord and conflict.
   ``I think we ought to establish we're a secular republic,''
Kurtz said.
   But others see in the inexorable march toward individualism a
tendency to ignore social ills such as poverty and homelessness.
   Arthur Simon, head of the Christian hunger relief group Bread
for the World, said the mushrooming need for church-run soup
kitchens and homeless shelters is indicative of an abdication of
public responsibility.
   ``There's been a diminishing sense of concern for the common
good. We have so elevated the value of individualism and liberty
and freedom, it has been detached from the sense of common good,''
Simon said.
   There are some signs of change.
   In reaction to a Supreme Court ruling this year, a coalition
ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union to the National
Association of Evangelicals is lobbying for legislation mandating
that only a ``compelling state interest'' could be used to deny a
religious practice, rather than simply the fact the practice
violates another law.
   ``We're in the midst of a culture war - a battle over the moral
values that are going to define our society,'' said Robert Dugan,
public affairs director of the evangelicals association.
   The stakes are high in a society that traditionally has depended
on religion to supply a set of moral ground rules.
   ``There is no secular rationality we can impose,'' Newton said.
   In his travels throughout the nation, Tocqueville observed that
religion is the one institution that can temper Americans' tendency
toward selfishly pursuing their own ends.
   More than a century and a half later, the worst fears James
Madison envisioned in the Federalist Papers about the fragility of
a democracy without a sense of public virtue are becoming a
reality, said Harvard Divinity School Dean Ronald F. Thiemann.
   ``Without any common or public virtue that holds us together as
American people, while that won't be the end of the American
experiment, that will be an unhappy resolve to the American
experiment,'' Thiemann said. ``It would just be a much less happy
and a much less virtuous enterprise than the American experiment
might have been.''

<TEXT>
   The Associated Press poll on religion was
conducted by telephone Nov. 16-20 among a random sample of 1,006
adults in the contiguous United States. Interviewing was done by
ICR Survey Research Group of Media, Pa.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of sampling error, meaning
that 19 of 20 times its findings should be within 3 points of the
result if every adult American were asked the same questions. The
error margin is larger for subgroups.
   There are other sources of poential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions.
   Here is how the questions related to this story were phrased;
because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   -How important would you say religion is in your life? Would you
say it is: Very important: 58 percent. Fairly important: 28
percent. Not very important: 13 percent. Don't know or no answer: 1
percent.
   -Have you attended any religious services within the last seven
days? Yes: 44 percent. Within the last 30 days? Yes: 62 percent.
Within the last year? Yes: 80 percent. (Cumulative results were
compiled by asking follow-up questions to those who had not or
didn't know if they had attended within the last week or month.)
   -Do you believe that religion can answer all or most of today's
problems, or that religion is largely old-fashioned and out of
date? Religion can answer: 64 percent. Religion is out of date: 19
percent. DK-NA: 17 percent.
   The people polled were asked, ``What is your religion?'' If they
said Protestant, Congregational, Episcopalian, Lutheran, Methodist,
Presbyterian or United Church of Christ, they were categorized as
mainline Protestant. The evangelical category comprised 10 other
responses, including Baptist, Church of God and Pentecostal.

   Those cheerful green plants may be doing more
than adding a touch of nature to your home or office. Some
scientists think they are keeping you healthy by eating hazardous
indoor air pollution.
   W.C. Wolverton, a retired NASA researcher who now has his own
lab in Picayune, Miss., said potted plants are amazingly efficient
at eliminating such pollutant gases as formaldehyde, benzene and
trichloroethylene from the air.
   ``I think we are closing in on the real economic solution to the
indoor air pollution problem,'' Wolverton said in a telephone
interview.
   The nation's florists and nurserymen are enthusiastic, of
course. The Associated Landscape Contractors of America has set up
the Foliage for Clean Air Council to promote and publicize studies
by Wolverton and others.
   A Mississippi businessman, Wayne Anderson, established a company
to market Wolverton's invention, ``Nature's Filter,'' which uses a
fan to draw air through a plant's root system, apparently
accelerating the pollution-eating effect.
   ``We've done a lot of testing on it and it looks really good,''
Anderson said. His Alliance Research and Manufacturing Corp. plans
to sell the plant-based filter through interior landscapers for
$130.
   Wolverton, an environmental engineer, said his studies show the
fan-aided plant filter can do the job of 100 normal plants in
cleaning up gases given off by paints and varnishes, particle board
or synthetic carpet fibers, or contained in tobacco smoke.
   His work has focused on benzene, formaldehyde and
trichloroethylene, all compounds found commonly in homes and
offices and known to cause irritation and illness and possibly
cancer. He has used dwarf azaleas, golden pothos, bamboo palms,
English ivy, pot mums and other plants.
   The research began as part of the National Aeronautic and Space
Administration's effort to plan for air filtration in future space
habitats, where humans would be livng for years without any way to
bring in fresh air.
   Not all experts in the field are sold on Wolverton's findings.
   ``I'm a Wolverton skeptic,'' said Thad Godish, professor of
natural resources at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind. ``I
think everybody should have plants in their houses, but it's highly
improbably that they'll be useful for air cleaning.''
   Godish published a study in 1988 critiquing some of Wolverton's
earlier research on spider plants and formaldehyde gas coming off
particle board.
   ``The small amount I saw just said there's no way in the world
putting spider plants in the house is going to make a difference,''
Godish said.
   Wolverton said critics pointed out important gaps in his early
studies, but said his newest research answers any questions that
have been raised.
   ``Our original work was limited,'' he said. ``Those have been
constructive criticisms.''
   Wolverton said his most recent studies suggest that the
cleansing process is more complicated than it first appeared.
   ``At first we thought the plant leaves were doing all the
work,'' he said. ``Now we find the soil and microorganisms are
major players.''
   There was some concern, Wolverton said, that a plant exposed to
nasty chemicals would absorb them for a while - then ``just get
sick and die and dump it back into the environment.''
   Instead, he said, the plants seem to get better at filtering the
pollutants the longer they are exposed.
   ``As we keep exposing the plants, they seem to absorb more and
more, rather than less and less,'' he said.
   A possible explanation, he said, is that the microorganisms in
the potting soil adapt to the benzene, formaldehyde or other
chemicals they are exposed to and begin to thrive on them.
   ``This is not surprising, since it is a well-established fact
that microorganisms have the ability to genetically adapt, thereby
increasing their ability to utilize toxic chemicals as a food
source when continuously exposed to such chemicals,'' Wolverton
wrote in a 1989 NASA study.
   He said the people most likely to benefit from pollution-eating
plants are those in energy-efficient homes or offices, tightly
sealed to keep out cold air, or in mobile homes, usually made with
materials that give off suspect gases.
   Plants, Wolverton said, are ``probably the only economic
solution to sealing these buildings for energy efficiency and to
make them healthier.''

   Bournet Huddleston says the
Persian Gulf confrontation is about freedom, although Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia aren't democracies.
   Walter Boomer, Jackie Jones and others hope to right a wrong.
Scott Swindle and Julie Taylor figure it's about oil.
   Jerome McReynolds just wonders why.
   A clear mission is essential to the success of any military
operation, but opinions about why they may be asked to fight vary
widely among the thousands of GIs in Saudi Arabia.
   President Bush has been at pains to explain the mission, both to
keep American troops informed and to hold together the polygot
international coalition that has opposed Iraq since it invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Operation Desert Shield began at King Fahd's request, to defend
Saudi Arabia.
   Bush drew his ``line in the sand'' to protect the kingdom and
the American interest in stable oil supplies, to liberate Kuwait
and restore its emir, check Saddam Hussein and free U.S. hostages
held by Iraq.
   Since then, there has been talk of destroying Saddam's military
machine and his capacity for developing nuclear weapons, forcing
him from power and creating a new order in the Middle East.
   In November, the United Nations gave Saddam until Jan. 15 to
leave Kuwait or face military action. By that time, the United
States will have about 430,000 soldiers in the Persian Gulf.
   Congressional opposition to the use of force has increased, and
Bush said last month of the confusion over Desert Shield's purpose:
``If I haven't done as clear a job as I might have on explaining
this, then I've got to do better, because I know in my heart of
hearts that what we're doing is right.''
   If force proves necessary, Bush has pledged, it will be an
all-out strike rather than the muddled, incremental response of
America's intervention in Vietnam two decades ago.
   ``This will not be another Vietnam,'' he declared. ``This will
not be a protracted, drawn-out war.''
   Perhaps for most of the troops dug into the Saudi sand, the word
from the commander in chief is enough.
   ``I came over here because someone in authority told me to,''
said Lance Cpl. Will French, 24, of Johnstown, Pa., who serves with
the 1st Marine Tank Battalion. ``I've got my questions, but I'm not
at liberty to say what they are.''
   Bournet ``Hollywood'' Huddleston, a Marine lance corporal from
Los Angeles, said: ``We're all here to kick some ass. Let's free
these people so we can go home and be free again.''
   Generally, the GIs feel their reason for being in Saudi Arabia
is to defend this Islamic kingdom, which has the world's largest
oil reserves, about 255 billion barrels.
   More than a few believe the whole gulf confrontation is about
the price of gasoline and ensuring supplies of cheap oil for
Americans.
   ``Thousands of people are going to die if we go to war or if we
get gassed,'' said Airman Julie Taylor, 20, of Lake Tahoe, Calif.
``I don't think a quart of Valvoline is a good reason for it.''
   Pfc. Scott Swindle, 20, of Albany, Ore., said: ``I don't think
it's worth all our lives for oil and gas, but it's my job, so I'll
do it.'' Swindle is with the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment.
   Others feel the mission is to check Saddam's aggression and deny
him nuclear and chemical weapons that threaten peace.
   ``We're here for more than just the price of a gallon of gas,''
said Master Sgt. J.R. Kendall of the 82nd Airborne Division. ``What
we're doing is going to chart the future of the world for the next
100 years. It's better to deal with this guy now than five years
from now. One way or another, he's got to be dealt with.''
   Jackie Jones, a 25-year-old Army lieutenant from Springfield,
Va., said the purpose is ``to show the rest of the world the United
States is not going to stand for bullies trying to wipe other
countries off the face of the earth. If we let him get away with
this, who knows what's going to be next?''
   She serves with a Patriot missile battery of the 18th Airborne
Corps.
   For some, it's a simple matter of right and wrong, a feeling
that runs from the top brass down through the ranks.
   ``There are things worth fighting for,'' said Lt. Gen. Walter
Boomer, 52, who commands the U.S. Marines in Saudi Arabia. ``A
world in which brutality and lawlessness are allowed to go
unchecked isn't the kind of world we're going to want to live in.''
   ``Someone's got to pay the price for freedom over here,'' said
Lance Cpl. Anthony Uhler, 20, of Pontiac, Mich., who serves with a
Marine Light Armored Infantry company.
   The reasons for fighting seem clearest among combat units
closest to the Kuwaiti border. Doubts are found more readily among
those pulled from base offices to live in tents or the reservists
and National Guard members plucked from civilian life.
   ``I actually don't know why we're here,'' said Staff Sgt. Jerome
McReynolds, 39, of Montgomery, Ala., a National Guardsman with the
1241st Postal Unit.
   ``The mission? I'd really like to know. What is it?''

   Albert Einstein called it the biggest blunder of
his life, but scientists said today that an idea he presented in
1917 about the universe may have been right after all.
   Einstein came up with the ``cosmological constant'' to fix a
problem: His general relativity theory clashed with his belief that
the size of the universe was unchanging.
   The constant was a mathematical term that implied that the
universe contains a repulsive force that acts against gravity. When
Einstein added it to an equation describing his relativity theory,
the equation predicted a constant-size universe.
   But scientists later showed that the universe was actually
expanding. The cosmological constant fell out of favor.
   The late physicist George Gamow, in his autobiography ``My World
Line,'' wrote that Einstein told him that introducing the
cosmological constant was ``the biggest blunder he ever made in his
life.''
   But there might be something to it after all, British scientists
suggest in today's issue of the British journal Nature.
   George Efstathiou, William Sutherland and Steve Maddox of the
physics department at the University of Oxford argue that the
existence of the force represented by the cosmological constant
would solve several problems with a standard theory about the
universe. It ``should be taken seriously,'' they say.
   The standard theory includes the Big Bang that gave birth to the
universe, and says that by far most of the mass in existence now is
unobserved stuff called ``cold dark matter'' that would have a
gravitational effect on the rest of the universe.
   Recent observations show more clustering of galaxies on very
large scales than basic versions of the standard theory predict,
the new report says. But the clustering could be accounted for by
incorporating the force described by the cosmological constant into
the standard theory, the scientists propose.
   Their hypothesis suggests that the expansion of the universe was
dominated by cold dark matter through perhaps the first one-third
to one-half of the history of the universe, but that the
cosmological constant force governs it now, Sutherland said in a
telephone interview.
   The hypothesis also accounts for the uniform intensity of the
energy left over from the Big Bang, and a number of distant
galaxies that are difficult to fit into the volume of space
allotted them by the standard theory, Sutherland said.
   ``It's still very speculative,'' Sutherland said. ``I certainly
would not like to claim that the cosmological constant is
definitely there. It's a longshot. But it's a possiblity that we
have to take seriously.''
   In a Nature editorial, theoretical astrophysicist Edmund
Bertschinger of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said the
new report ``may be the strongest case to date for a non-zero
cosmological constant.''
   Still, he said in an interview, the new evidence ``would not
convince a jury, I think, beyond a reasonable doubt.'' There are
other possible explanations for the clustering of galaxies, he
said.
   But the new work will promote debate, and scientists will
``start to consider more seriously the consequences of having a
cosmological constant,'' he said.
   For Einstein, of course, it comes too late.
   ``He missed a golden opportunity,'' Bertschinger said. ``He
could have predicted on the basis of his theory that the universe
must be either expanding or contracting. But he didn't trust the
theory enough to do that.''

   Nehama Ben-Eliahu is one of the few Israelis
still willing to brave the hawkish trend in public opinion and turn
out for street protests against military rule in the occupied
territories.
   But she also is lending her son money to buy a gun, so that he
feels safe from Palestinians who could threaten his isolated farm
near the West Bank.
   Her situation illustrates the new dilemma of the doves in
Israel: how to reconcile their calls for peace with the Arabs with
new fears of random attacks against Jews.
   The dilemma has been heightened by a recent rash of Palestinian
stabbing attacks on Israelis, and also by Iraqi threats to attack
the Jewish state.
   The result is that Israel's peace movement, usually active in
times of stress, has grown unusually quiet.
   ``There is a lot of confusion and worry. We have tried to build
bridges, and now a volcano has come,'' said Aryeh Eliav, a leading
activist in the left-of-center Labor Party.
   Meetings between Israeli and Palestinian activists, once common
and public, are now held either behind closed doors or not at all.
   Only 1,000 activists attended a candlelight peace vigil staged
outside Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's residence for the recent
third-year anniversary of the Palestinian uprising.
   At the outset of the revolt, such Israeli peace protests
routinely drew crowds exceeding 10,000. But that was when
consciences were guilty over soldiers shooting at youthful,
stone-throwing demonstrators.
   Now that the Arabs are attacking Israeli civilians, sentiments
are different.
   Earlier calls for Jewish-Arab coexistence have been replaced by
a new battle cry of ``separation'' - recreating the old Green Line
dividing Israel from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The Persian Gulf crisis also has undermined the peace movement.
Leftists can no longer argue that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
is at the heart of Middle East instability, and the Palestinian
question - for the time being - has been removed from the top of
the United States' agenda.
   ``Nobody wants to be active because they don't see where it will
get them,'' said Nahum Barnea, a political analyst and left-leaning
columnist for the Yediot Ahronoth daily.
   Public opinion surveys show Israelis taking a hawkish turn,
pollster Hanoch Smith said. ``A harsher attitude is permeating the
entire society...The impact of the events is a tougher line,'' he
said in an interview.
   At the same time, however, the growing violence is challenging
right-wing beliefs that Israel can annex the territories captured
in the 1967 Middle East war, home to 1.7 million Palestinians.
   The effect, in many cases, has been an unexpected meeting of the
minds between right and left on the need to separate the
Palestinian and Jewish populations.
   ``Nowadays almost everyone, left and right, wants separation,''
Barnea said. ``The Jew has never so feared the lone Arab working in
his neighborhood.''
   The shared mood has legislators Michael Eitan of the right-wing
Likud bloc and Gad Yaacobi of left-leaning Labor cooperating to
draw up a plan for gradually separating the economies of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip from Israel.
   But Yosef Lapid, a right-winger, noted in the daily Maariv that
a more common reaction to the violence is an all-pervasive gloom.
``Despair has invaded Israeli society, it eats away at us,'' he
wrote.
   Hawks consider it pointless to press their arguments and the
doves believe that ``whether consciously or not, there is no chance
for dialogue with the Palestinians,'' Lapid added.
   Through the uncertainty, the ``Women in Black,'' a grassroots
organization born with the uprising, remains the most visible
vestige of the peace movement in Israel.
   Mrs. Ben-Eliahu is a member. She and several hundred women line
up in downtown Jerusalem and a dozen other towns every Friday,
wearing black dresses and holding placards that read: ``End the
occupation.''
   The key to their survival, says organizer Anat Hoffman, is that
they appeal to the majority of Israelis who are sick of the
occupation.
   ``We aren't standing up for the Palestinians. We say the
occupation is bad because of what it does to us. It costs us ($2
million) a day and is morally disastrous,'' Mrs. Hoffman said.
   Mrs. Ben-Eliahu, 55, who was born in New York City and is a
zoologist at Jerusalem's Hebrew University, started demonstrating
for peace after her 19-year-old son lost a leg in the 1973 Middle
East War.
   The Palestinian uprising only reinforces her feelings, she says.
``There is no question that unless we reach a political solution,
there will be an escalation in violence.''
   But being a pacifist isn't so simple these days, she adds,
noting the money she is loaning another son for a pistol. ``You
see, these are our needs today. It shouldn't be this way ... We
would all just have a better chance if there were peace.''

   Robert Buffham had to send his children
to live with friends. Felix Dean had to learn mothering skills.
Other men lament that they can't even go to neighbors for
consoling.
   They are the spouses of soldiers, and their wives have been sent
to the Persian Gulf for Operation Desert Shield.
   In a reversal of roles from the nation's previous military
deployments, many a man has been left behind to raise the children,
run the household and deal with the possibility that his wife could
be killed in war.
   ``Their greatest fear has been that Mommy won't come home, that
Mommy's already dead,'' said Robert Buffham, husband of Spec. Lona
Buffham of the 3rd Armored Cavalry at Fort Bliss.
   Buffham, 38, was left to care for children ages 5, 2{, 1{ and a
7-week-old newborn.
   ``She had her maternity leave, (but) two days after her
maternity leave, they said: `Hey, let's go. Time to pack up and
leave,''' Buffham said Monday.
   Although Buffham, a Vietnam veteran, was accustomed to caring
for the children and home while his wife pursued her Army career,
this latest seperation has been difficult, especially for his
oldest son.
   ``When all this happened all the kids - Aaron mostly - started
asking, `Where's Momma?' And (Aaron) knew that Momma went away. I
said, `Momma's going to Saudi Arabia.
   ``Then he said: `I know what's going on there. Mommy won't come
back alive.'''
   On the advice of a doctor, Buffham sent his children to live
with friends who had raised seven children.
   ``He (Aaron) needed to be with someone with mothering skills. I
did not have that much mothering skills,'' Buffham said.
   Buffham attends support group meetings on post to discuss
problems and exchange suggestions with other male spouses. Fort
Bliss' Army Community Services started the group in September to
cater to male dependents.
   ``No matter what happens she knows I'm there. My wife knows my
kids are well taken care of, because she knows that's No. 1 in my
household,'' said Felix Dean, 33, whose wife, Spec. Beverly Dean is
with the 11th Air Defense Artillery.
   Dean's poor vision and other disabilities forced him out of the
Army, so for years he has been staying at home with his five
daughters.
   ``My friends ask me, `Did your Dad go to Saudi Arabia?''' said
Felicia, 8. ``And I say, `My Dad didn't go, my Mom did.'''
   Mrs. Dean's deployment helped Dean heal a strained relationship
with his oldest daughter who now lives in Georgia.
   ``She called me and talked to me and she talked to me about boys
... Since my wife's been gone, we have grown a bond. We can talk
and laugh. I'm there for her because her mom isn't,'' Dean said.
   The men say many of the adjustments they are making are not very
different from the adjustments wives of soldiers must make, such as
living on less income. But there are some distinct differences.
   ``The wives can always go next door and knock on their
neighbors' door and have coffee with them and talk,'' said Scott
Chamberlain, 32, at home with five small children. The former
Marine's wife, Spec. Brenda Chamberlain, is a cook with the 11th
Air Defense Artillery.
   ``I go next door and it's, `What do you want?'''
   Don Dittsworth, who stays home with Candy, 2, said he avoids
visiting female neighbors so he won't be accused of ``hitting up on
them.''
   His wife, Spec. Cristal Dittsworth, drives an 80-ton tractor
trailer and is a member of the 233rd Transportation Co.

   At Success magazine, an editor's mistakes are
costly: $25 for a mispelling (er, misspelling). Another $25 for
poorly-placed hyphens. A whopping $500 for getting somebody's name
wrong.
   For the past two months, sloppy copy has meant surrendering cold
cash at Success. Gleefully plundering inattentive editors is Editor
in Chief Scott DeGarmo, who says he grew tired of making the same
complaints to the same people about the same errors.
   ``When my people see a typo anyplace, I want them to step on it
like a roach,'' DeGarmo said Wednesday.
   But taking money for mistakes? Isn't that a little extreme?
   ``No! If you asked the average guy on the street, he would say
of course an editor should know how to spell,'' DeGarmo said. ``If
a bricklayer made a crooked wall, or an accountant couldn't add,
people would be angry. But editors think it's nothing to not know
how to spell.''
   The wallet-lightening approach to achieving good grammar began
Nov. 5 at the monthly magazine, when DeGarmo fired off a memo to
his six senior editors. Errors would no longer be tolerated; fines
would be levied.
   DeGarmo, in the course of his job, would check all copy handed
in by his senior editors. If he caught any grammatical or
typographical errors, the person responsible would pay: $25 for
spelling mistakes, the same for hyphens after words ending in -ly
(highly-sought, for example).
   The fines would come from the money budgeted for their raises.
   ``The editors? They were appalled and astounded,'' DeGarmo
recalled. ``But all the so-called positive reinforcement hadn't
worked.''
   How serious was DeGarmo? Ask senior editor Michael Maren, who
had a $600 lesson in how to spell epitaph, guerrilla and
prestigious, among other words.
   After watching DeGarmo take a big bite of his money, Maren was
apologetic.
   ``We probably didn't check things as carefully as we should
have,'' he told The Wall Street Journal.
   DeGarmo's approach has paid off in more than one way. In
addition to collecting $625, he has not seen a glitch in copy since
Nov. 29.
   ``It's not enough to ask people to do their best,'' DeGarmo
said. ``You've got to tell them what you want; in my case, it was
perfection.''

   Black anger erupted into violence four
times in the last decade, but now black lawyers are leading a
``quiet riot'' - an economic boycott that is costing millions of
tourist dollars.
   The activists were aggrieved by local government's handling of
anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela's visit in June.
   Instead of enthusiastic welcomes and ceremonies Mandela received
elsewhere on his U.S. visit, he got an official snub and criticism
for refusal to repudiate staunch supporters Fidel Castro, Yasser
Arafat and Moammar Ghadhafi.
   ``They have personal feelings, but that has nothing to do with
their official duties,'' boycott organizer H.T. Smith said of
Miami-area officials.
   Under the name Boycott Miami: Coalition for Progress, organizers
asked groups with national conventions set for the area to go
somewhere else.
   The boycott was announced July 17. As of Tuesday, the Greater
Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau reported eleven groups had
canceled their gatherings - some as far in the future as 1993 -
costing nearly $5.5 million.
   Other estimates have ranged as high as $12 million.
   Organizers want four things: an apology from area mayors for the
Mandela snub; greater business and employment opportunities for
black citizens; a review of federal immigration policy regarding
Haitians, who routinely are detained and deported while Hispanics
are admitted to this country; and a federal investigation of the
Miami police's violent breakup of a July protest by Haitians.
   Boycott organizers prepared a video comparing Miami to Selma,
Ala., notorious symbol of discrimination and police violence. Now
they have their sights set on the National Football League, in
hopes of chasing off the 1993 Super Bowl.
   At first, local officials seemed to ignore the boycott.
   But as the conventions continued to leave - and non-black
groups, such as the National Organization for Women and the
American Civil Liberties Union, joined in - worried community
leaders began to speak up and say they were sorry for the way
Mandela had been treated.
   Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez, who had joined four other
Cuban-American area mayors in signing a letter critical of Mandela,
issued a statement Dec. 12 expressing regret for pain felt by
members of the black community. But Suarez did not apologize in a
statement also watched carefully by his city's dominant
Cuban-American constituency.
   The tourism industry feels helpless, said conventions bureau
spokesman Mayco Villafana.
   ``We feel we have been held as victims since some of the demands
are political in nature,'' Villafana said. ``Only the entire
community working can solve them or resolve this.''
   Black support of the effort has not been monolithic. The
National Urban League, whose Miami president opposes the boycott,
went ahead with its three-day gathering. Pickets greeted them at
their hotel Dec. 12.
   Critics said coerced apologies would be meaningless, but Smith
disagreed. As an example, he spoke of the unwilling apologies
children give under orders from their parents.
   ``The object is not their sincerity, but to have them subjugate
their ego and recognize the personhood of whomever they've
disrespected,'' Smith said.
   And organizers also discounted claims that the boycott was
costing the jobs of minimum-wage black laborers.
   ``You don't hear black folks saying `Oh woe is me' because
they're not the ones losing the money,'' said Rev. Victor Curry.
   Maria Devalle, spokeswoman for the Hotel-Motel-Restaurant and
High Rise Employees local 355 of the AFL-CIO, said she had not
heard of any jobs threatened or lost.
   ``We would love to get the business back, that's for sure,''
said Jeff Abbaticchio, spokesman for Doral Resorts in Florida,
which owns an oceanfront hotel in Miami Beach and a resort on the
outskirts of Miami.
   He said the hotels were trying to make up the lost business by
courting European and Japanese travelers as well as ordinary
non-convention tourists.
   ``The bad publicity, I think that's what hurts us most,''
Abbaticchio said.

   A daredevil whose attempt to shoot
Niagara Falls in a barrel hit a snag at the last moment has been
fined nearly $3,800.
   David Munday's 790-pound steel-and-foam-rubber barrel became
stuck at the brink of the falls, which straddle the U.S.-Canadian
border, on July 15. He was fished out of the swirling waters by
rescue workers manning a crane.
   Munday, 53, was attempting to become the first person to twice
shoot the falls in a barrel, having successfully made the plunge in
1985.
   Defense lawyer Donald Loney said Munday - also an experienced
skydiver and helicopter pilot - had planned to put no one but
himself in danger.
   ``He was sober and at all times co-operated with police,'' Loney
argued. ``Aside from this fixation with Niagara Falls, he has no
criminal record.''
   Prosecutors on Tuesday asked the presiding judge, Morley
Kitchen, to fine Munday, a diesel mechanic, 10,000 Canadian dollars
($8,633) - the maximum penalty for performing an illegal stunt on
Niagara Falls property.
   Munday had been fined 1,500 Canadian dollars ($1,295) for his
first plunge.
   Sgt. Fred Hollidge of the Niagara Parks Police said July's
rescue operation put his officers in danger and tied up emergency
personnel for more than two hours.
   ``We don't need these people to show the beauty of the falls,''
he said.

<TEXT>
   The Swiss Alps are riddled with
underground military bases, but apparently none like the top secret
installation on the edge of this plush resort.
   Deep inside Mt. Horneggli, men and women were trained to become
the nucleus of a Swiss resistance force to fight foreign occupiers.
   The facility was ordered shut down after its existence was
revealed last month, but the political furor continues.
   A camouflaged gate opened into a 100-yard-long tunnel lined with
13 rooms where the would-be guerrillas - nicknamed the ``Swiss
Rambos'' - lived, learned and practiced combat shooting in classes
of 20 each.
   At least one member was a high-ranking Defense Ministry
official, and others served in the Swiss militia army.
   Swiss officials have denied the commandos had any links with
``Gladio,'' the recently uncovered paramilitary network in NATO
countries set up to fight a potential Soviet invasion. Switzerland
is neutral.
   Word of the 400-member unit, codenamed P-26, and a parallel and
equally secret intelligence unit, P-27, came to light in a
parliamentary inquiry last month.
   The parliamentary commission concluded that P-26 and P-27 were
financed through the Swiss army but operated without any
supervision from civilian authorities.
   The government branded both units ``vestiges of the Cold War''
and ordered them disbanded.
   The disclosures brought unwanted attention to the Swiss militia
army a year after a national referendum showed considerable public
sentiment - one of every three voters - for abolishing it.
   Ursula Mauch, a Social Democratic member of parliament, said the
inquiry revealed ``only the tip of the iceberg.''
   ``These Rambos, Swiss-style, were to defend a democracy which
they didn't think much of,'' she said in a parliamentary debate on
P-26 last week. ``It's like ordering a wild dog to guard a
sausage.''
   Defense Minister Kaspar Villiger rejected as absurd allegations
that P-26 could have been used in a military coup, but he admitted
he had little information on the unit.
   The parliamentary inquiry discovered that Villiger's chief
spokesman, Hans-Rudolf Strasser, held a key post in P-26. Strasser
was then suspended from this job for failing to inform his superior
of his double life.
   The parliamentary committee found that Ferdinand Jakob Knecht, a
construction engineer, headed P-27, and Bernhard Wehrli, the
president of the Swiss Association for Environmental Protection,
served as an aide.
   Public attention focused on Efrem Cattelan, 59, a lawyer and
reserve colonel who quit his job as insurance executive in 1979 to
head P-26 at an annual salary of $160,000.
   Cattelan directed training at the Gstaad underground center,
only a few minutes' walk from Elizabeth Taylor's luxurious chalet.
   The resort homes of other celebrities, like violinist Yehudi
Menuhin and actor Roger Moore are also close by.
   Cattelan said he was never one for spy thrillers.
   ``I once tried to read a John Le Carre novel but then put it
aside after about 40 pages, never touching it again. I felt it was
too complicated.''
   Cattelan said P-26 cooperated with unidentified British contacts
but he denied it had any links to Gladio units in NATO countries.
   ``The British have great experience, dating from colonialist
times,'' he explained to an interviewer. ``Just think of Lawrence
of Arabia.''
   Most of the P-26 members, including about 20 women, were in
their 40s or even older, according to Cattelan.
   ``These were people who were ready to be tortured or killed and
to risk reprisals against their family,'' said Lt. Gen. Heinz
Haesler, the army's chief of staff, defending P-26 against the
widespread criticism.
   The unit was supposed to expand into a network of independently
operating sabotage and resistance groups in case of an invasion.
Members knew each other only by code names.
   The independent Bern newspaper Der Bund suggested that life at
the unit was rather mundane.
   ``There was no uprising being plotted, there were no agents a la
James Bond at work and there were no silent killings.''
   ``P-26 was comprised mainly persons of advanced age who had to
sign a contract, were insured against accidents and received
official per diems,'' it said.

   Kenneth Weiner said he liked working in the
shadows as the Detroit Police Department's resident security
expert, a self-styled cloak-and-dagger man.
   But when it came to his other job as a commodities investor,
Weiner was more out in the open and liked to drop names -
especially that of Mayor Coleman A. Young, according to the
government and dozens of Weiner's ex-clients.
   During the past two months, Young's name has been invoked in the
federal courtroom where prosecutors are trying to prove that Weiner
and two co-defendants skimmed millions of dollars invested with
them from 1983-86.
   The mayor of the nation's ninth-largest city has never been
indicted or charged with a crime. But Young has cited the Fifth
Amendment against self-incrimination in refusing to testify in the
tax and fraud trial of Weiner, his one-time business partner and
son of his former stockbroker.
   Weiner, steel broker Alvin Gendelman and radiologist Steven
Lewin are being tried on 36 counts of wire and tax fraud. The trial
is expected to continue into next year.
   Before Weiner began testifying Dec. 6, nearly 60 investors told
the court they lost money in what the government claims was an
illicit pyramid scheme.
   Some have testified that Weiner's Comsec Corp., founded in 1980
and dissolved by the state in 1985 for failing to file annual
reports, lured their money in part because Weiner played up his
connections with Young and Police Chief William Hart.
   Weiner, Gendelman and Lewin returned more than $13 million to
investors during 1983-86 but pocketed $4 million on which they paid
no taxes, an Internal Revenue Service investigator testified in
late November.
   Prosecutors say Weiner sought to save himself by turning on
Young - offering to secretly record conversations with the mayor
for the FBI. Thirty-nine such tapes were made from February to May
1987 at the mayor's residence, but they produced only speculative
evidence against Young.
   Several months later, Weiner struck a deal with the IRS,
recording 40 conversations with Young. Those tapes, like those made
for the FBI, apparently failed to incriminate the mayor.
   As the police department's civilian deputy chief and security
specialist from 1979 to 1986, Weiner met with anti-terrorism
experts and added high-tech security systems to the city's water
system and mayor's residence.
   While Weiner is on trial a federal grand jury has been
investigating allegations of Police Department corruption.
   No one has been indicted in that investigation, focusing on the
alleged theft of more than $1 million from an undercover police
fund. Weiner has been publicly accused by the police chief of
looting the fund.
   Weiner told investigators that Young and Hart helped him take
the money from the fund, according to an FBI memo obtained by The
Detroit News.
   Young and Hart have denied any wrongdoing. They refused to
comment about the memo, the newspaper reported Tuesday.
   Under questioning by U.S. Attorney Sheldon Light, Weiner
brusquely denied earlier statements he gave the FBI indicating the
money went to allegedly fake corporations he set up with Young's
blessing.
   ``Weiner stated that all the money from the secret service fund
which went to ... companies established by him was for his sole use
and not for any type of contract work for any type of security
project,'' according to a transcript of a May 1990 interview by the
FBI.
   Weiner told Light his security and consulting firms received
money from the fund for ``any and all expenses, all travel, time,
equipment ... for any project assigned me by the mayor, anywhere I
had to go.''
   He also denied telling the FBI that in 1986, Young suggested
propping up the failing Comsec by having Weiner ``become a Detroit
Police Department consultant, and any money Weiner needed he could
get from the Detroit Police Department.''
   Pressed to explain those and other discrepancies in his
testimony and his earlier statements to investigators, the tone of
Weiner's testimony turned in a week's time from self-assured to
plaintive.
   ``I've done my best to tell the truth,'' he told Richard Lustig,
Lewin's attorney. ``I learned how to lie when I went to work for
the government.''

<HEAD>Santa Suds: More Brewers Toasting Season With Special Beers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   At the New England Brewing Co. in Connecticut, the holiday
spirit flows this season in flavors of cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom
and vanilla. This is the stuff of winter, of eggnog, fruitcake and
cider.
   But this is beer.
   New England's 1990 Holiday Ale is one of an increasing number of
special seasonal beers that are being cooked up at small breweries
around the country.
   Scholars of suds can raise toasts this season with mugs of Hoppy
Holidaze, Kris Kringle, Our Special Ale, Celebration Ale, Wassail,
Christmas Ale, Winterfest, Winter Welcome, Winter's Tale - just a
few of the names given by brewers to their holiday offerings.
   ``A lot of the small breweries, a lot of the microbreweries, are
doing what brewers in Europe have been doing for centuries, and
that is brewing different beers for the different seasons, and the
most special season is the winter,'' said Tom McCormick, a
specialty beer distributor in Rocklin, Calif.
   McCormick is carrying nine holiday brews this year and said his
volume in winter beers has roughly doubled each year for the past
several years.
   ``There's really been an increase in awareness of microbreweries
and specialty beers in general, so it's all part of that,'' he
said.
   The holiday beers are usually stronger and fuller-bodied than
brewers' usual offerings; they typically are a deep reddish-amber
and are relatively high in alcohol content.
   And increasingly they are brewed with spices, including
cinnamon, orange peel, ginger, nutmeg and cloves.
   The tradition, beer-o-philes say, goes back centuries. The main
flavoring ingredient in most beer now is hops, a bitter vine, but
brewers once used whatever spice they had on hand.
   Philip Markowski, the brewer at New England Brewing in Norwalk,
Conn., traces the tradition to America's colonial days. David
Edgar, news editor of the New Brewer magazine in Denver, said it
goes back much further, ``to pagan festivals at which they would
brew a ritual ale.''
   ``So basically,'' Edgar said, ``the tradition of a special
winter festival beer has existed since before Christ - since before
there was a Christmas.''
   In the United States, the modern tradition can be dated more
accurately. It goes back 16 years, to the first holiday ale
produced by the Anchor Brewing Co. of San Francisco.
   Anchor's first offerings were strong, hoppy ales, perfect for
sipping in front of a fire on a cold winter's night. Later, the
brewery began adding spices that gave the beers a delicately fruity
smell and taste.
   Other early entrants on the holiday beer scene included the
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. of Chico, Calif., which produces a bold,
unspiced Celebration Ale, and the Yakima Brewing Co. of Yakima,
Wash., which makes Grant's Spiced Ale.
   Once distributed only locally or regionally, these beers are now
in gourmet liquor shops and bars across the nation.
   They have company in some imported holiday beers, including Aass
Winter Lager from Norway, Young's Winter Ale from England and
Samichlaus from Switzerland, which claims to be the strongest lager
in the world.
   The giants of the beer industry have mostly ignored the holiday
beer trend. The small brewers say it's simply too difficult for the
major brewers to interrupt their production lines to make seasonal
batches of beer.
   One exception is the Adolph Coors Co., which has been marketing
Coors Winterfest, a full-bodied lager, since 1986. The company
won't release sales or production figures, but spokesman Todd
Appleman said the market for Winterfest has been growing annually.
   ``I think each year you're going to see it become a little more
national, a little more high-profile,'' Appleman said.
   You'll hear no such claim from Grant Johnston, the brewer for
the tiny Marin Brewing Co. in Larkspur, Calif. His Hoppy Holidaze
winter beer won a gold medal at this year's Great American Beer
Festival in Colorado.
   But fans of Hoppy Holidaze are lucky to find it on the other
side of San Francisco Bay, much less across the country. This
year's entire production was 28 barrels, each containing 31 gallons
of pale, spicy beer.
   Still, Johnston isn't complaining. He's only worried about
selling out.
   ``We try to have it on hand through Christmas and New Year's,''
he said, ``but I doubt we'll last that long.''
   After that, it's just like baseball. There's always next year.

   The man who ignted a firestorm over minority
scholarships is used to living dangerously. He spent years
prosecuting Ku Klux Klansmen and other perpetrators of violent
racial hate crimes.
   But this time the peril was political, and Assistant Education
Secretary Michael L. Williams acknowledged Tuesday that he was not
prepared for it.
   The 37-year-old lawyer said last week that universities
receiving federal money could not legally reserve scholarships for
minorities - and promptly created turmoil in the White House, the
civil rights community and the ranks of higher education.
   ``Politically naive,'' Williams called himself, although he had
served in 1988 as a domestic policy adviser to the Bush campaign
before his appointment to head the Education Department's civil
rights office.
   Others had less charitable descriptions. ``An outrage,'' said
Ralph Neas, executive director of the 200-member Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights. ``We don't find this helpful at all,''
said David Merkowitz, spokesman for the American Council on
Education, an umbrella group of colleges and universities.
   At the center of the storm is a black Texan with a blue-ribbon
resume, solid conservative credentials and an equally solid record
of fighting racial injustices.
   Williams is a Midland, Texas, native and childhood friend of
President Bush's son George. His parents and his wife, a pilot and
mechanical engineer, all attended historically black colleges.
   He received three degrees from the University of California - a
B.A., a master's in public administration and a law degree. And
while he was there he challenged the school to admit more blacks by
weighing socio-economic factors as well as test scores.
   Williams' resume also lists community involvement: he was a Big
Brother in Midland, and now he tutors elementary schoolchildren in
reading.
   Then there is his career at the Justice Department, where he
served from 1984 to 1988 as a senior trial attorney in the civil
rights division headed by William Bradford Reynolds.
   He tried and won cases against North Carolina Klansmen who
conspired to obtain stolen military weapons; an Idaho white
supremacist who tried to drive black and interracial families from
their homes; a Kentucky Klansman who fire-bombed the home of a
black family; and law enforcement officers in Alabama, Arizona,
North Carolina and Oklahoma who assaulted private citizens.
   ``He went after them with a vengeance and was very successful,''
said Reynolds. ``He was a very savvy lawyer, a thoughtful,
level-headed kind of guy who learned very quickly and did
exceptionally well.''
   Not on his resume, but mentioned often by friends and
associates, is Williams' sense of humor - reportedly as acute as
Eddie Murphy's. Another trademark is an ever-present pair of lizard
cowboy boots. He also collects plates - one from every state in
which he's tried a case.
   Awash in ambivalence last week over Williams' blanket ruling,
Bush nevertheless defended the official as ``extraordinarily
sensitive, very intelligent.'' Even his political opponents are
charitable.
   ``I will not question Mr. Williams' integrity or his
credentials,'' said Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., who summoned
Williams to a hearing of his House Education and Labor Committee to
explore the scholarship issue.
   Hawkins, echoing the views of many, said he believes Williams
``just merely issued an opinion which is based on what he perceived
to be the administration's position.''
   That turned out not to be the case, at least at the highest
levels of the administration, and Williams announced Tuesday that
colleges could keep offering minority-only scholarships if they
used private money earmarked solely for that purpose.
   A senior White House official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Williams was not ordered to change his mind.
   ``We had a conversation in which we were exploring what could
and couldn't be done under the regulations. And Michael was very
cooperative, very interested in finding what his full flexibilities
were,'' the official said. ``I think he deserves credit for being
able to come up with a solution.''
   Williams himself rejected any suggestion that he had been
manipulated by the administration, either in his initial ruling or
in softening it.
   ``I haven't been a lackey for anyone,'' he declaed. ``The
position I took was a position I took because I thought it was
right.''
   Whether the current brouhaha will lead to stardom or oblivion is
anyone's guess. ``In this town,'' said Reynolds, ``I would not dare
predict.''

   Seeking to avert unrest by members of
the Sandinista-controlled army, President Violeta Chamorro said
Tuesday that she was vetoing military cuts approved by lawmakers of
her governing coalition.
   Mrs. Chamorro said cuts beyond those already negotiated with the
leftist military leaders could ``raise political-military tensions
which could have unforseeable results.''
   She earlier warned that the cuts approved last week by the
92-member National Assembly could push the country into ``chaos and
a bloodbath.'' The military has already accepted a drastic cutback.
   In a videotaped statement broadcast late Tuesday, Mrs. Chamorro
said she was sending the veto to the legislature. It was not clear
whether it arrived before lawmakers adjourned for the night.
   The president said she was using a line-item veto against the
National Assembly's $19.6 million cut in the military budget. She
offered a compromise $8.5 million reduction in her original
proposal of $78.6 million.
   Either figure would be far below the $177 million budget she
said the army had in 1990 or the $131 million that she said
military leaders had proposed for the coming year.
   She kept overall spending to roughly the legislature's total of
$495.8 million by cutting money from the contingency fund and the
finance ministry.
   The 1990 military budget was the last passed by the Sandinista
government, which waged a 10-year battle against U.S.-supported
Contra rebels. Mrs. Chamorro defeated the Sandinistas in elections
earlier this year and took office in April.
   Deputies debated the budget package late Tuesday as government
leaders lobbied lawmakers to change their vote and army leaders to
accept some cuts as a compromise.
   Earlier Tuesday, about 150 recently retired military officers
held a march in front of the assembly building to protest the
budget cuts, claiming up to 10,000 officers would be fired if the
assembly overrides Mrs. Chamorro's veto.
   The demonstrators were among 5,000 who retired under a generous
program that has reduced the size of the armed forces from about
100,000 when Mrs. Chamorro was inaugurated April 25 to less than
29,000.
   But the retirement program would not cover officers fired
because of budget cuts, Sandinista lawmakers say.
   The 51 members of Mrs. Chamorro's 14-party coalition and one
independent legislator voted in favor of the larger military cuts
last week. If they stick together, they would override Mrs.
Chamorro's veto.
   The 39 Sandinista deputies don't have the majority needed to
counter the pro-government bloc. A budget needs 47 votes to pass.
   Under the plan opposed by Mrs. Chamorro, the $19 million taken
from the military would be spread around to benefit 15 other
ministries and government departments.
   Mrs. Chamorro has said that while she favors further reducing
the armed forces, ``we can't do it overnight.''
   ``I think this (veto) will serve so that the gentlemen deputies
reconsider this matter in its true dimension, and decide whether or
not they will support Mrs. Chamorro,'' said Minister of the
Presidency Antonio Lacayo.
   Lacayo last week also warned that drastic cuts in the armed
forces budget would endanger the nation's stability.
   A final budget for 1991 must be approved by midnight Thursday.

   Cable television's two comedy channels are
ending the battle of the belly laugh, merging into a single cable
channel next year, the companies said Tuesday.
   HBO's The Comedy Channel and MTV's HA! will become Comedy TV.
   ``Over time, the network will develop its own identity,'' said
Frank J. Biondi, president and chief executive of Viacom
International Inc., which owns HA! and the MTV Networks.
   Biondi spoke at a news conference with Michael J. Fuchs,
chairman and CEO of Home Box Office, the world's largest pay TV
service.
   Comedy TV will begin early next year, Biondi and Fuchs said,
with HA! and The Comedy Channel continuing their separate
operations in the interim.
   No money changed hands in the deal. The assets of each comedy
channel will be transferred on Jan. 1 to the joint venture, based
in New York City and staffed by employees from both HA! and The
Comedy Channel.
   A president for the new channel will be chosen from outside
Viacom and Time-Warner, which owns HBO.
   It has been tough sledding for both channels. HBO's channel was
launched in November 1989 and MTV's HA! on April 1 this year. Both
made original shows, but relied on reruns of off-network comedies
to fill their 24-hour schedules.
   The two channels reached a total of 15 million households, with
HBO's channel in 8.5 million homes and MTV's in 6.5 million, but
each rolled up big losses - as high as $20 million a year.
   They also had trouble getting channel space on already packed
cable systems. The CEOs said the merger made economic sense.
   ``The bottom is that it would have been very expensive for us to
push on,'' Biondi said. ``Common sense just prevailed. We were
doing a very good job of standing each other up.''
   Rumors of the merger had been circulating for months. The deal
was struck less than than a month after two proposed rival cable
services devoted to law - ``In Court'' and ``American Courtroom
Network'' - said they would merge.
   About 12 new cable services plan start-ups in coming months,
according to one estimate by Erica Gruen, a cable analyst at
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising. The hopefuls range from a 24-hour
talk show channel to the Cowboy Channel.
   All-sports ESPN serves the most cable homes, 55.9 million,
followed by Turner's Cable News Network, which serves 54.4 million.

<HEAD>Reservists May See Desert Shield Tours Extended by Six Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of the 125,000 reservists called to
active duty for the Persian Gulf crisis may be away from their
homes and jobs longer than they had imagined.
   The Defense Department said Tuesday it may ask Congress for
authority to keep non-combat reservists on active duty for a full
year. The current limit is six months.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney has made no final decision but probably would seek the extra
authority after Congress returns in late January.
   Non-combat reservists provide support such as medical care,
intelligence analysis, aircraft maintenance, truck driving, water
purification and legal assistance. They account for about 110,000
of the reservists called up from all four services.
   ``We would like to have from the Congress the authority to
extend both combat and non-combat reservists to the full 180
(days), plus another 180,'' Williams told reporters.
   ``We don't need to have that authority in our hand right now
because we just haven't come to that time yet, but I think as a
general proposition ... it would be nice to have as much
flexibility as we can in terms of dealing with the reserves,'' he
said.
   Congress already has authorized Cheney to keep combat reservists
on active duty for 360 days, although the only such units activated
so far - three National Guard combat brigades - were called up for
180-day tours. Cheney probably will extend their tours by another
180 days if they are deployed to the gulf.
   Williams said no decision has been made on whether to send the
National Guard combat brigades to Saudi Arabia or keep them in the
United States as backups.
   The first non-combat reserve units were called up in late
August, so some reservists have been scheduled to return to their
civilian jobs and their homes in February.
   Williams said some Reserve or National Guard units may be needed
for longer periods.
   ``It may well be that there are units with unique capabilities,
one-of-a-kind capabilities ... and when we hit the six-month period
... we need to decide whether we want to come back and ask Congress
to extend that,'' he said.
   In other developments related to troop deployments in Operation
Desert Shield:
   -The Pentagon said 10,000 U.S. troops have arrived in the gulf
area this week, bringing to more than 270,000 the number of
American soldiers, airmen, sailors and Marines in the region.
   -Williams said Iraq has added 10,000 troops to its force in and
around occupied Kuwait, bringing the total to 510,000. The Iraqis
have about 4,000 tanks, 2,500 armored personnel carriers and
infantry fighting vehicles and 2,700 artillery pieces, the
spokesman said.
   -The Army said elements of the 7th Corps Artillery, based at
Augsburg, Germany, have begun deploying to the gulf in support of
Desert Shield. It also said elements of the 11th Combat Aviation
Brigade began deploying from Illesheim, Germany.
   -The Army ordered to active duty 636 Army Reserve members from
Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts and
Pennsylvania, for aviation and intelligence support.

<HEAD>No-Layoff Clause Keeps Cash-Strapped City from Cutting Work Force</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two years ago, 16,000 city workers traded
pay raises and increases in benefits for a no-layoff clause. Now,
with the city facing collapse, what looked like a so-so deal to
employees seems pretty good.
   As New York and other cities in the Northeast consider municipal
layoffs by the thousands, most non-uniformed workers in
Philadelphia know they won't be out in the cold. They just don't
know if there will be paychecks.
   The cash-strapped city says it will go broke next week, raising
the possibility that paychecks for Philadelphia's 30,000 employees
could be held up.
   In 1988, Mayor W. Wilson Goode and non-uniformed workers
represented by two unions reached a four-year agreement that capped
health and welfare benefits, delayed wage increases and offered
early retirement to avoid 1,400 layoffs.
   In return, Goode agreed to no layoffs during the last two years,
starting this year.
   James Rawls, a heavy-equipment operator for the city Water
Department and president of Local 394 of the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Employees, said Tuesday he originally
opposed the contract.
   ``To me, a four-year contract is too long,'' he said. ``But
after we passed it and the city got into this financial condition,
then we realized that it was a better deal.''
   The clause ensured labor peace for Goode's second term but has
cost him maneuverability during the financial crisis, said Dianne
E. Reed, local director of the Pennsylvania Economy League, a
government research group.
   ``I would say it was a big concession on the part of the city,''
she said.
   Before agreeing to the no-layoff deal, Goode had won a bitter
20-day garbage strike in 1986 by threatening to fire the trash
haulers. They later ended the strike without any significant
contract gains.
   Former City Controller Joseph Vignola said the no-layoff clause
surrendered too much, especially after Goode's tough stance in the
trash strike.
   ``Taking a strike of that length, I think the city could have
come away much stronger in its labor-management negotiations,'' he
said.
   The cash crisis - blamed on sluggish tax revenues and rising
labor costs - threatens the city with a projected $229.5 million
budget shortfall for the current fiscal year and $278 million for
the next.
   The city is trying to sell $200 million in short-term notes to
banks and two pension funds.
   That amount could help prevent paydays without paychecks, but
isn't likely to cover bills that have languished for months.
   Meanwhile, there has been no talk of trying to break or
circumvent the no-layoff provision.
   ``A deal's a deal,'' said Larry Lyde, a heavy-equipment operator
for the Water Department.
   Police and firefighters have no similar provisions in their
contracts but are likely to be safe from layoffs because their
services are considered essential.
   Despite looming paycheck fears, Lyde said he just tries to keep
his mind on his work, such as clearing out clogged drains after
Tuesday's morning rain.
   ``It's unfortunate what's happening with the money,'' he said.
``But the job still has to be done and the public still expects the
job to be done well.''
   City officials have said if they can't meet an entire payroll,
they may issue partial payments in hopes of keeping people on the
job. Managers have urged workers to keep working if their biweekly
paychecks stop, Rawls said.
   ``That's fine if you miss one pay,'' he said. ``After one pay, a
lot of people are going to have to start looking elsewhere'' for
jobs.

<HEAD>Limited Western Help Has Not Much Improved A Hard Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOGDAN PREDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Romanians overthrew the Communist
dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu a year ago, they expected help
from abroad to quickly improve their low standard of living.
   But Western aid, scaled back in recent months because of
political repression in Romania and harder times hitting the donor
countries, has had little effect on the widespread miseries of
everyday life.
   ``The aid was like a drop in the huge ocean of our needs,'' said
Emanel Cosmovici, head of a Bucharest-based international
humanitarian aid organization.
   Officials hope Romania's solid support for the West in the
Persian Gulf crisis and government economic reform begun in
November with the approval of the International Monetary Fund will
restore the country to the West's good graces.
   The hopes for a new ``Marshall plan'' for Eastern Europe were
initially fed by the flood of food, medicine and energy aid that
immediately followed the revolution.
   A variety of Western organizations - such as World Vision
International, Project Concern International, Caritas, Orphanages
Trust, the French Medecins du Monde and Medecins Sans Frontieres
and the International Red Cross - have set up programs throughout
Romania.
   Some governments also have helped. Germany donated $33 million
worth of energy last year and is expected to do so again.
   The United States has been the leading aid donor, according to
diplomatic sources. U.S. aid in 1990 included 500,000 tons of feed
grain, 7,500 tons of butter and more than $4 million in medical
aid.
   The European Community is providing some heating and electricity
in the dozens of orphanages nationwide that house an army of
100,000 orphaned and abandoned children, the legacy of Ceausescu's
policy to increase the population.
   But conditions at most orphanages are still very poor, and the
infant mortality rate in Romanian hospitals is still among the
highest in Europe, at 30 per 1,000.
   Half the deaths occur because of complications related to
malnutrition, said Nicolae Dirina, head of Bucharest's Budimex
children's hospital, which received aid from Caritas.
   ``Aid did not improve our situation,'' he stressed. ``The
problems are nearly the same.''
   And the economic misery grows. Prices have doubled or tripled,
stores are empty, industrial production is down 20 percent and the
average monthly paycheck is worth only $20 on the black market.
   Under market reforms, money-losing state enterprises face
bankruptcy and the government has said it will stop providing
industry with cut-rate energy. By and large, private homes are dark
and cold.
   The flow of aid slowed down halfway through 1990 because of
fears of recession in the West and doubts over the new Romanian
leadership's sincerity about democracy and economic reform.
   The United States froze non-humanitarian aid to Romania in
mid-June in response to the National Salvation Front government's
methods in breaking up a 53-day anti-government sit-in.
   Six people died in the crackdown and the National Front was
widely condemned for calling miners in from the provinces who beat
opposition activists and journalists.
   Romanian officials hope their economic reform as well as support
of the United States and its allies in opposing the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait will pay off.
   Premier Petre Roman welcomed this month's European Community
decision to grant Romania and neighboring Bulgaria medical, food
and energy aid worth $343 million.
   Some aid officials believe the best solution to Romania's ills
is in retraining Romanians.
   Dr. Barbara Bascom, manager of World Vision's Romanian Orphans'
Social and Education Support Project, said economic problems are
matched by ``the disaster with Romanian professionals who had been
deprived of any information from outside the country.''
   Bascom's group has launched a $10 million project aimed
partially at retraining nurses and doctors in relating to their
patients. She said the program would improve the lives of at least
7,500 Romanian orphans.
   At one Bucharest orphanage, 11-year-old Robert Dragomir, who was
paralyzed from the waist down in a car accident, was less
ambitious. He asked Western reporters to bring him aid consisting
simply of ``oranges and a television.
   ``I have been here for six years and never got out to see
anything,'' he said.

   Mendelssohn wrote to his brother in 1846 that
never had a debut of one of his compositions gone so well as
``Elijah,'' his dramatic oratorio for orchestra, soloists and
chorus.
   It went exceptionally well again Tuesday night. Kurt Masur
conducted ``Elijah'' with the New York Philharmonic, taking over
the first of four performances that had been scheduled for the late
Leonard Bernstein.
   This was the first time Masur has conducted the Philharmonic
since being named its music director. He will follow Zubin Mehta
who resigned, effective at the end of the present season.
   The Philharmonic, which took part in selecting Masur, played for
him with sweep and alertness. The back of the Avery Fisher Hall
stage was filled with the majestic strains of the huge Westminster
Symphonic Choir.
   Texts are from the Bible, telling of the Hebrew prophet Elijah
pitting God against Baal, who is called by his priests.
   When God sends fire, after Baal didn't, Elijah has Baal's
priests killed. Jezebel wants Elijah killed and he flees to the
wilderness but returns, with God's protection. Finally, he is taken
to heaven in a fiery chariot.
   Baritone Kevin McMillan sang Elijah. He was the least loud of
the four soloists but one could hear a fine voice, a focused tone
and his words very well. The other three were good, soprano Edith
Wiens, mezzo Marietta Simpson and tenor Richard Leech. There were
five other singers with small solo parts.
   Masur looks at home on the New York Philharmonic podium, nis
body often swaying, his left arm jutting out and back like a boxer.
He didn't use a baton.
   The music and its performance were solid, rising to heights of
emotion at times. At the end of the first half of the concert,
there was foot stamping along with applause, to emphasize the
audience's welcome to Masur. When Masur left the stage, he waved to
the orchestra, his welcome to them.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Conservatives Unhappy With Bush, Sununu</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``We're going into a Christmas mode here,''
President Bush declared joyfully. But conservatives are finding
little to cheer about as the president prepares to head to Camp
David for the holidays.
   Bush is making right-wingers increasingly unhappy. Even their
longtime envoy to the White House - chief of staff John Sununu - is
turning out to be no Santa Claus.
   With Bush absorbed in the Persian Gulf crisis, Sununu has been
tending the store more and more, and with a firm hand.
   Sununu has been involved in a series of decisions that have not
exactly thrilled the Republican Party's right wing - including
fillig two Cabinet vacancies with moderate Republicans and an
ungainly about-face on the Education Department ruling on minority
scholarships.
   ``Sununu is setting up the office to let be Bush be Bush. He's
not trying to move his own agenda forward. He's not advancing the
conservative agenda,'' said conservative activist Richard Viguerie.
   About the only Christmas present Bush could give conservatives
that would prompt widespread cheer - naming Jack Kemp as the new
Republican Party chairman - did not seem to be in the cards.
   Bush leaves the White House on Friday and will stay at the
presidential retreat in the Catoctin Mountains of Maryland until
New Year's Day.
   The president, clearly winding down for the holidays, told
reporters Tuesday: ``No more questions. No, no, no. I've been too
accessible here. We're going into a Christmas mode here where I
won't be doing as much of this kind of work.''
   But he leaves Washington with many problems unsolved. Topping
the agenda is the lack of progress toward a peaceful end to the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   He had planned to spend much of the time, as always, hunting for
quail in Beeville, Texas. But because of the gulf crisis he decided
to stay closer to the capital. Camp David is just a 25-minute
helicopter ride from the South Lawn of the White House.
   Bush also must confront other problems when he returns. The
economy is slumping. International trade talks have broken down.
   And domestic spending will have to be slashed to the bone to
comply with the recent budget agreement, to finance military
operations in the gulf and to account for lower revenues from
business because of the recession.
   Bickering among Republicans may seem the least of Bush's
immediate worries. But it doesn't make his job any easier.
   And some of the harshest criticism from conservatives is
directed at Sununu. The GOP's right wing had already been annoyed
with Sununu for his role in Bush's switch on taxes.
   Conservatives now are griping about Bush's decision to bypass
conservative candidates in picking two moderate Republicans, former
Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Rep. Lynn Martin of Illinois,
to be the secretaries of education and labor, respectively.
   Alexander is a longtime friend of Sununu's, and Martin and
Sununu worked together in Bush's 1988 campaign.
   Furthermore, conservatives are grumbling about the
administration's effective reversal - also carried out by Sununu -
of last week's ruling by the Education Department against minority
scholarship programs at publicly funded colleges and universities.
   Many conservatives supported the ruling, although it created a
storm among civil rights groups.
   And, in what might be the final straw, the administration is
even talking about jettisoning a proposal long dear to conservative
hearts: a cut in the capital gains tax rate.
   Bush said Tuesday that while he still strongly supports a lower
capital gains rate and thinks it would stimulate the economy,
``rigid caps'' under this fall's budget agreement will make it
difficult to include in his new budget.
   ``I haven't given up my philosophical commitment ... But we're
faced with this practical problem,'' he said.
   Viguerie, who has been openly critical of Bush, said the
president ``is not even giving us half a loaf. He's giving us
crumbs now.''
   If Bush is re-elected in 1992, ``he will never need
conservatives again in his life. And then it will be open
warfare,'' Viguerie said.
   A senior administration official, who briefed White House
reporters Tuesday under ground rules guaranteeing anonymity, was
asked about the administration's latest trouble with conservatives.
   ``We will continue to stay open to conservatives,'' the official
replied. ``I think we're developing an agenda that makes sense for
the next couple of years and I think they're very much a part of
providing input.''

<HEAD>Law Ministers Weigh Move to Outlaw Eastern Communists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Driven from power, accused of corruption,
routinely derided by prominent politicians, East Germany's former
Communists have found yet another reason to circle the wagons.
   The top lawmen from the 16 states that comprise the united
Germany will decide next month whether to seek to outlaw the party
as ``an enemy of the constitution.''
   The interior ministers, who run the justice systems in their
states, say they want to know whether the party violates laws
against extremism that initially were devised to prevent a
resurgence of Nazism.
   They agreed to meet in January and decide whether to begin the
legal process that has been used to outlaw extremist groups in the
past.
   The former Communists, now called the Party of Democratic
Socialism, denounced the move as ``scandalous.'' They said they
would in fact use the constitution to prevent such a probe from
taking place.
   ``We'll raise an objection with the Supreme Court,'' said party
board member Klaus Steinitz.
   Purged of many Stalinists, the Party of Democratic Socialism
says it espouses essentially what its name says and contends it is
willing to work within the constitution.
   It remains a distant third in popularity among eastern Germans
and won enough votes in the Dec. 2 national elections to seat 17
lawmakers when the new united Parliament convenes Thursday in
Berlin.
   The effort among the interior ministers, hatched at a conference
in Dresden over the weekend, is the latest move to kick the
Communists out of the new society.
   Since West Germany swallowed East Germany on Oct. 3, authorities
have:
   -Fired all of the top officers from the East German army because
they were considered too close to the old regime.
   -Arrested or tried to arrest top leaders on charges ranging from
corruption to manslaughter. Former party chief Erich Honecker is
holed up at a Soviet military hospital outside Berlin.
   -Quickly accepted the resignation of Lothar de Maiziere from the
Cabinet of Chancellor Helmut Kohl after it was alleged the former
East German prime minister may have worked for the Communist secret
police.
   -Staged a massive police raid on the former Communists'
headquarters in a hunt for clues to absconded cash, which was
located after a party official allegedly transferred it to the
Soviet Union.
   -Arrested dozens of reputed spies for the former Communist
government.
   Likewise, the new state governments in eastern Germany have
vowed to purge their bureaucracies of the old guard. Workers
routinely complain that their factories are still run by
Communists.
   In the past week, students have staged several protests against
the planned revamping of the socialist school system.
   Now, the 16 interior ministers who run Germany's law enforcement
are entertaining the possibility of having the party banned.
   At the interior ministers' conference, Dietmar Schlee of
Baden-Wuerttemberg state called for a ``quick and united
clarification of the question of whether the PDS is an enemy of the
constitution.''
   Bavarian Interior Minister Edmund Stoiber even said his state,
Germany's largest, would initiate its own secret surveillance of
the party to dig up evidence unless the issue were decided by the
end of January.
   He said because the party is ``based on orthodox
Marxist-Leninist fundamentalism, it should be classified as a
constitutional enemy.''
   If the state governments ask for a probe, the Supreme Court
would have final say on whether the party is a threat to the
constitution.
   Former West Germany, the laws of which now govern the united
Germany, has outlawed neo-Nazi groups but let a far-right group and
the small West German Communist Party run candidates for office.

   Reports of lenders botching mortgage rate
calculations sent homeowners scrambling to see if they're being
overcharged and left bankers wondering if they're losing millions.
   The controversy over adjustable rate mortgages, loans with
variable interest rates, began when a former federal banking
auditor estimated widespread errors in the loan portfolios of
failed savings and loans in the Midwest.
   John Geddes, formerly with the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp., estimated up to 35 percent of adjustable-rate
mortages nationwide were miscalculated and borrowers were
overcharged $8 billion from 1979 to 1989.
   There haven't been any additional studies to confirm Geddes'
statements. Officials were unclear how widespread the
miscalculations may be.
   ``Clearly the portfolio that we were looking at is the smaller
savings and loans in the Midwest. But whether the problem is
broader than that, I don't know,'' said Steve Seelig, director of
the FDIC's division of liquidation.
   An adjustable-rate mortgage, or ARM, has an interest rate that
fluctuates according to a financial index, such as the rise or fall
of Treasury bills.
   Errors may arise when a lender mistakenly uses the wrong index,
calculates the index at an improper time, or lacks proper computer
software to tabulate the mortgage.
   Geddes' allegations in August 1989 sent shockwaves through the
lending community. At least four class-action lawsuits have been
filed in Indiana, alleging savings and loans excessively
overcharged borrowers.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, issued a report on the problem in October. Federal
auditors now pay special attention to the loans when reviewing the
financial records of banks, credit unions and savings and loans,
said Mitch Rachlis, senior economist for the GAO.
   Meanwhile, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination
Council, an umbrella group of federal financial services
regulators, is coordinating an examination of banks, savings and
loans, and credit unions which have adjustable-rate mortgages in
their portfolios.
   The move by the council shows the federal government is taking
the problem very seriously, said Fritz Elmendorf, spokesman for the
Consumer Bankers Association in Arlington, Va.
   So, apparently, are homeowners. HSH Associates, a New Jersey
mortgage information service, is marketing kits for borrowers to
double check their mortgage calculations.
   Paul Havemann, HSH vice president, said last week his office had
gotten about 400 telephone calls in a couple of days, ``and that
would be a conservative guess.''
   Attorney George Plews of Indianapolis said he's working with
attorneys in 15 other states whose clients have problems with
adjustable-rate mortgages. Plews, who filed the four class-action
lawsuits in Indiana, said a typical loss ranges from $200 to $1,400
over the term of the loan.
   ``Our information is that this is not a new problem in the
industry,'' said Plews. ``The inaccuracies in the portfolio was
relative common knowledge in the late 1980s'' among bank
regulators.
   Plews said his review shows the problem afflicts banks as well
as savings and loans.
   ``It's almost an accident the lawsuits right now are against the
S&amp;Ls,'' he said.
   The American Bankers Association disagreed, saying the problem
now appears to be confined to just savings and loans. Spokeswoman
Tara Little said some lenders have reviewed their portfolios and
found ``almost no errors.''
   Industry officials said they were unaware of any consumers
avoiding ARMs in light of the recent publicity.
   Some analysts say the bulk of the errors may even be in
consumers' favor. Others say the damage is evenly split.
   ``The adjustable-rate mortgage problem is more a problem of
complexity as opposed to a problem of greed,'' Seelig said.

<HEAD>Yeutter Warns Against Tinkering With New Farm Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Start tinkering with the 1990 farm law and
farmers might wind up with a further cut in federal payments, not
more money, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter warns.
   Last week in Denver, the board of directors of the National
Farmers Union called on Congress ``to reopen and rewrite parts'' of
the five-year law passed this year.
   The NFU directors said the 1990 law will devastate family
farmers and rural areas unless changes are made.
   Yeutter told broadcasters Tuesday in a telephone news conference
that ``opening the farm bill would be a big mistake for everyone,
including the folks from the Farmers Union.''
   In the view of some critics, a problem with the 1990 legislation
is that it was subject to federal budget-cutting restraints. This
pared $13.5 billion from commodity program operations over five
years.
   One result was to reduce the amount of acreage eligible for
direct subsidies, or ``deficiency payments,'' under annual crop
programs. Critics say this will cut into farm income.
   ``In my judgment, U.S. agriculture came out very well in the
budget exercise, when one considers the circumstances under which
that bill was legislated,'' Yeutter said.
   But he added, ``There are still some folks in American
agriculture who believe that the $26 billion in federal subsidies
that was provided in 1986 ought to be the norm and that if they
just make a strong enough appeal in Washington, that would still be
possible.''
   That was a reference to the record $25.8 billion paid to farmers
in fiscal 1986 under Agriculture Department commodity programs.
Those payments since have declined to a fraction of that annual
rate.
   Yeutter said he sees ``no chance whatsoever'' that Congress
would return to the agricultural spending levels of the past.
Rather, he predicted that if lawmakers reopen the farm bill debate
the chances would be 50-50 that spending would be cut, not raised.
   Bob Denman, a National Farmers Union spokesman in Washington,
said no one had suggested that commodity spending be boosted to $26
billion a year over the five years of the law.
   But the NFU does believe some parts of the law can be
strengthened and adjusted to help protect family farmers more than
the 1990 act does.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Unless world trade talks get back on track,
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter thinks the European Community
may suffer major political and economic damage for its refusal to
compromise.
   And if it comes to an agricultural trade war with the EC, said
Yeutter, the United States is prepared to fight.
   Negotiations among 107 nations in the so-called Uruguay Round of
trade talks collapsed Dec. 7 in Brussels after the EC refused to
bend on U.S. proposals on major farm trade issues, including
cutbacks in internal price supports and export subsidies.
   The United States, backed by Australia, Brazil and other major
exporters, sought sharp reductions in subsidies, while the
12-nation EC, Japan and South Korea were against the plan.
   Efforts are being made to reconvene the talks in mid-January,
but Yeutter said further negotiations would have little chance
unless the EC is prepared to change its hard-line stance.
   But Yeutter told reporters Tuesday he thinks some internal
pressures are developing in favor of a reassessment of the EC
position.
   He said he was Europe last week in the aftermath of the Dec. 7
breakdown and found the community to be ``very embarrassed by what
happened in Brussels.''
   The community ``will probably not concede that publicly, but the
fact is they suffered a major geopolitical defeat in Brussels, with
essentially all of the world leaving with dissatisfaction and
disappointment in the EC position,'' Yeutter said.
   ``A lot of folks in Western Europe are chagrined by the present
status of the Uruguay Round and are concerned that the (EC) may
bear the lion's share of the blame for failure, should it occur,''
he said.
   Consequently, he said, a number of ``working level'' people in
the EC are trying to reassess the bloc's position in hopes the
stalled talks can be rejuvenated. But Yeutter said he didn't know
at this point whether this can translate into changes at the EC's
leadership level.
   ``I'm pessimistic about the potential outcome (of the talks) so
long as the community maintains its present intransigent stance,''
he said.
   Earlier, in a telephone news conference with broadcasters,
Yeutter he was not ready to tip off the EC what the United States
might do if the Uruguay Round of talks fail completely.
   ``I want them to be uncertain about what our response would be -
and a bit frightened by the potential,'' he said. ``So, I'm not
going to discuss publicly what the United States might do.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - After a two-month layoff, the Soviet Union has
bought a substantial quantity of U.S. corn, according to the
Agriculture Department.
   Officials said Tuesday that private exporting companies sold
266,500 metric tons to the Soviets under terms of the current
long-term supply agreement between the two countries. No prices or
other details were disclosed.
   The pact, including a three-month extension, expires Dec. 31. A
new five-year agreement will begin at that time.
   A metric ton of 2,205 pounds is equivalent to 39.4 bushels of
corn. Thus, the 266,500 tons would be about 10.5 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.19 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA's five-day average. Thus, the latest
sale could have a farm value of about $23 million.

   Big Ben's chimes, which traditionally announce the

   A decision has yet to be made, and some British Broadcasting

tradition by banning the bong this holiday season.
   Big Ben's bells have traditionally been used on BBC airwaves as
a lead-in to news bulletins, but disappeared temporarily in March
after cracks were found in the hammer arm of the 132-year-old main
bell that sounds the hours.
   The original Victorian hammer was removed and replaced with a
new $15,000 steel hammer.
   But ever since the 13-ton bell went back into service in August,
BBC executives have been unenthusiastic, so much so that they have
begun phasing the chimes out of regular broadcasts.
   ``It just sounds wrong,'' said Simon Schute, the BBC's general
manager of operations and engineering, responsible for setting up
microphones in the Big Ben belfry, 334 steps above the street.
   ``I'm no expert on bells, but this one has a sort of curious
start and finishes sounding sort of small and clattery. It
certainly doesn't sound rich and important anymore,'' Schute said.
   Britain's Independent Television News has solved the problem by
continuing to use a 1967 recording of Big Ben. But BBC executives
won't hear of it.
   ``We shall either use the real thing or nothing at all,'' said
John Breach, presentation organizer of Radio 4, the BBC's flagship
domestic channel.
   ``These are the chimes of Big Ben. To play a recording would not
be the same. It's not part of our tradition.''
   BBC Radio 4 replaced the bong with pips, the electronic signal
of Greenwich Mean Time, to introduce its daily news at 6 p.m. and
midnight and the weekend morning news.
   ``We don't mix pips and bongs,'' said Breach. ``Listeners have
missed Big Ben, but the decision was made at a more senior level
than myself that the sound quality wasn't as good as it used to be
and the switch to pips was permanent.''
   Breach said listeners understood the reason for the change, but
BBC executives fear the public may not be so patient with a change
in a holiday tradition that dates back to midnight, Dec. 31, 1923.
   Every year since then, the live sounds from Big Ben have rung in
the New Year and introduced the monarch's speech on Christmas Day.
   ``We're still trying to decide what to do. I believe we will
decide to use the bell. After all, what is more important,
tradition or a faulty bong?'' said Breach.
   BBC engineers have experimented with moving the microphones
which transmit the live bong. They tried placing directional
microphones on a nearby building in Parliament Square. Nothing
worked.
   David Heathcoat-Amory, the former junior environment minister,
told Parliament in October that the new bearings were to blame and
they would just take time to settle in.

<HEAD>Women Call for More Information, Safety Testing on Silicone Breast
Implants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women who have had silicone breast implants
seem to agree on one thing - that people considering this procedure
need more information and the implants themselves need better
safety testing.
   A panel of women told of their experiences with implants before
a House subcommittee Tuesday, urging action that ranged from a
moratorium on the sale of implants to an appeal to keep options
open for women who want their breasts reconstructed after cancer
surgery.
   Sybil Niden Goldrich of Beverly Hills, Calif., said the two sets
of implants she had have left her with a ``silicone sword of
Damocles hanging over my head.
   ``I've gone seven years without a recurrence of (breast) cancer,
but what will happen from the silicone?'' she said at the House
Government Operations human resources subcommittee hearing. ``I
shudder when I think about it.''
   The first implants left her with a body rash, pain, fever,
``rock-hard'' breasts and gynecological problems. They were
replaced with another set, but the problems continued. These
implants were removed also, and she had her breasts reconstructed
in a different procedure using her own body tissue.
   Her gynecological problems continued and she had a hysterectomy
two years ago. A biopsy of her liver at the time identified
silicone, she said.
   ``I encourage you to demand a moratorium on the sale of these
products until we are absolutely certain that the safety of these
implants can be proven beyond reasonable doubt,'' she said.
   Silicone breast implants have been used since the early 1960s.
They have been placed in about 2 million American women and are
implanted at the rate of about 130,000 a year.
   When 1976 amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act required
regulation of medical devices, breast implants were
``grandfathered'' into the market. This meant they did not have to
meet the specifications required of new products.
   The Food and Drug Administration has classified silicone
implants as high risk, but it has not yet finalized a regulation
that would require manufacturers to submit safety data or remove
their products from the market. FDA officials testified the rule
would be made final in March.
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., chairman of the subcommittee, said he
was concerned about the ``inordinate delay'' and ``seven years of
the agency dragging its feet,'' especially in light of the
unanswered questions about silicone implants.
   Another implant recipient, Rosemary Locke, director of a women's
breast cancer support program in the Washington D.C. area, gave the
panel a different perspective.
   Locke, who had a double mastectomy and reconstruction, said she
had some complications after surgery but explained that ``having my
body restored eased away much of the trauma of breast cancer.''
   ``I have never regretted my decision, even though I now know
more about silicone implants than when I made my decision,'' she
said.
   She urged the subcommittee and the FDA, as they consider breast
implants, ``please keep in mind the women who have lost breasts to
cancer. Silicone implants may be their only option for surgically
restoring their body.''
   Dow Corning Corp., one of the largest makers of silicone breast
implants, distributed a survey by the American Society of Plastic
and Reconstructive Surgeons that found 92 percent of women with
breast augmentation or reconstruction said they were satisfied with
their implant surgery.
   About 25 percent of silicone breast implants are for breast
reconstruction after breast cancer surgery. The rest are for breast
enlargement.
   The FDA has received 2,017 reports of adverse reactions from
silicone implants, said Walter Gundaker, acting director of the
FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
   About 3,000 other such reports are from saline-filled breast
implants, which are less common than silicone ones. However, the
saline implants also contain silicone.
   Witnesses at the hearing said these numbers were conservative
because many physicians and surgeons do not report the problems.

<HEAD>Judge Recommends Restrictions Against Neil Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's son Neil was guilty of
conflict of interest but should be allowed to accept a future
position with a savings institution under certain restrictions, an
administrative law judge says.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision charged Neil Bush in January
with conflict of interest in his role as a director of the failed
Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association of Denver.
   Administrative Law Judge Daniel J. Davidson, who found that Bush
exposed Silverado to ``abnormal risk,'' could have recommended that
he be barred permanently from the banking and savings industries.
   Instead, Davidson proposed to OTS Director Timothy Ryan that
Bush be required to meet certain conditions if he again becomes a
director or officer of a savings and loan or bank.
   For example, Davidson said, Bush should be required to get
advice from a lawyer on potential conflicts of interest if he takes
such a position. His recommendations, made Monday, were announced
late Tuesday by OTS.
   Davidson's proposals followed closely the recommendations of OTS
lawyers in the case against Bush, 35, an oil and gas developer.
Davidson agreed with the OTS attorneys that Bush's failure to fully
disclose his business ties ``involved a significant conflict of
interest constituting an inherently unsafe or unsound practice.''
   Silverado's collapse in December 1988 is expected to cost
taxpayers $1 billion.
   In his recommendation, Davidson said Bush's conduct was
``contrary to generally accepted standards of prudent operations
and exposed Silverado to abnormal risk.''
   Ryan will review Davidson's recommendation and is expected to
make a final decision this spring, agency officials said. Ryan
could adopt the recommendation, reject it or revise it, OTS
spokesman Tom Mason said.
   Bush's attorney, James Nesland, said his client would appeal
Ryan's decision if it embraced Davidson's proposal. Under
administrative law, Bush would have the right to appeal the
director's decision to a federal court.
   President Bush had no comment on the judge's recommendation,
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Davidson held a public administrative hearing in late September
in Denver, at which Neil Bush and government witnesses testified.
   The regulators accused Bush of failing to adequately inform
fellow Silverado directors of his business ties with developers
Kenneth Good and Bill Walters, who invested in Bush's oil company.
Good and Walters eventually defaulted on more than $132 million in
loans from Silverado.
   Bush has insisted that he committed no wrongdoing in voting as a
director to approve loans to Good and Walters. In addition, Bush
told Davidson in a legal brief submitted last month, ``there is no
likelihood that the alleged unsafe or unsound practices will
continue.''
   If he again becomes an S&amp;L or bank director, Davidson said, Bush
should be required to abstain from voting on any proposals
involving people or companies in which he has an interest.
   Bush also should make a full disclosure at least once a year of
his business relationships with customers or potential customers of
the S&amp;L or bank, Davidson proposed. He said the information should
be updated each time there is a relevant change in Bush's financial
situation.
   In addition to the government's conflict of interest case, Bush
also faces a $200 million negligence lawsuit filed against him and
other former Silverado directors by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp.

<HEAD>Der Spiegel Reporter Suspected of Spying for East Germany</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prestigious newsmagazine Der Spiegel's cover
story has a common theme these days in Germany but an unaccustomed
main actor: one of Spiegel's own reporters is suspected of spying
for Communist East Germany.
   This week's Spiegel, published Monday, spent 13 pages examining
the allegations against Diethelm Schroeder that surfaced last week
in a television expose.
   The Hamburg-based news weekly left Schroeder's name on the
roster of its Berlin bureau, but noted he was ``on leave.''
   Spiegel showed the drubbing it took from other German
publications: a headline in the mass-circulation daily Bild asked
if Schroeder was ``a traitor.'' A cartoon republished from the
Rheinische Post showed a Spiegel sleuth following a spy's tracks -
in a circle that became Spiegel's own trail.
   ``I have to live with this story,'' Schroeder said in a
telephone interview, denying he had worked for the East German
secret service or done anybody any harm.
   Spiegel called the denial a ``half-confession.''
   The 60-year-old native of eastern Germany, a military specialist
who worked in The Associated Press' German-language service for
five years in the Sixties, said his Spiegel colleagues had
explained that they had done major stories on other spy allegations
``and now we have to write a story about you.''
   ``I think it's correct,'' Schroeder said, adding with a laugh,
``I would have had more fun if it was another story, I think.''
   Last week, ARD television named Schroeder as having worked from
1964 to 1987 for the Stasi, as the now-defunct East Germany's
Ministry for State Security is called.
   Prosecutors confirmed that Schroeder was under investigation,
though there was no word on how serious a case he might face.
Conviction for passing state secrets can bring life in prison,
while a lesser charge of passing information to a foreign espionage
agency carries a maximum 10-year prison term.
   As Germany works to clear up the decades of cross-border spying,
prosecutors have already issued 61 arrest warrants this year.
   Spiegel, which grew up with postwar West Germany, has been
hitting the espionage issue hard along with other issues facing
newly united Germany.
   Only a week earlier, Spiegel had a scoop revealing evidence that
East Germany's first and only non-Communist prime minister, Lothar
de Maiziere, had a Stasi past. De Maiziere denies cooperating with
secret police but quit as deputy head of the governing Christian
Democratic Union while prosecutors look into the evidence.
   Schroeder, who remains free, denies any wrongdoing, telling
Spiegel he had had taken no money, sent no written reports and hurt
no one.
   Spiegel's article wondered whether his denial might have been a
``half-confession,'' and asked, ``Through which activities was no
one hurt?''
   Doing the cover story was difficult, said Wolfram Bickerich, a
senior editor in Hamburg who had been friends with Schroeder
through working together 16 years.
   ``But it was the only decision we could make, because we said if
we have such a case in our own house, we are obliged to do this,''
Bickerich said in a telephone interview.
   The cover story quoted Schroeder as saying the allegations were
a ``conspiracy against me or probably even against Der Spiegel.''
   It said three former Stasi officials had revealed details about
Schroeder's purported services for East German intelligence.
   But the magazine cast doubt on the claim in the television
program that Schroeder had given the East Germans valuable material
on West German and NATO defense planning and equipment.
   The affable reporter was on close terms with the current NATO
secretary-general, Manfred Woerner, a former German defense
minister. Schroeder was the first reporter to fly in a Tornado
fighter-bomber. He knew about scandals in West German officialdom.
   Schroeder came from the Baltic coastal region that fell under
Soviet occupation and became East Germany after World War II. He
was trained as a journalist under the Communist system but moved to
West Germany in 1956. His own story is that the Soviet suppression
of revolt in Hungary caused him to abandon the East. The allegation
is that he was slipped into the West as a budding spy.
   In his late 20s he worked for West German newspapers, and then
for AP's German news service in Frankfurt and Bonn from 1960 to
1965.
   He was questioned in 1964 on suspicion of espionage against
American forces. Schroeder read out a memo issued then to
subscribers of AP's German-language service saying a reporter had
been questioned, his home and desk had been searched, and he had
been set free because the interrogation yielded no reason for his
arrest.
   The memo did not name the suspected reporter, partly because he
had relatives living under Soviet occupation.
   Asked in the telephone interview if he had worked for the Stasi,
Schroeder said, ``No, the answer is no.''
   The questions directed to him, he added, were ``from former
times, not from the last 20 years.''
   In 1965, Schroeder went to work for the Bild newspaper in Bonn,
and moved to Spiegel's Bonn bureau in 1974.
   Spiegel quoted the chief federal prosecutor, Alexander von
Stahl, as saying proceedings also were under way against two
western German journalists other than Schroeder.

<TEXT>
   For five centuries, Spaniards emigrated to
the four corners of the globe in search of new worlds, gold or just
a better life for their families.
   Today, an economically solid, democratic Spain has become a
magnet for new generations of immigrants fleeing poverty and
dead-end lives in countries from Morocco to the Philippines.
   Although the steady flow of immigrants over the past decade has
not yet become overwhelming, Spanish officials are concerned about
how the country will cope with the newcomers, most of them illegal.
European Economic Community officials worry that Spain's loose
border controls will encourage illegal aliens and help them pass
into other Western European countries.
   They are part of Europe's greatest refugee migration since World
War II. It became a tide sweeping from east to west after the
Communist regimes of the Soviet bloc collapsed a year ago.
   This week, the government circulated copies of a report on
immigration to opposition leaders prior to coming parliamentary
debate.
   The report proposes an annual quota on immigration, tighter
border controls and heavy fines for those employing illegal
immigrants.
   According to Fernando Puig de la Bellacasa, head of the Interior
Ministry's domestic policy department, immigration is a new
phenomenon for Spain.
   ``We were an exporter of emigrants, now we're a country
receiving immigrants,'' he said. ``We're not used to it. We're not
set up for it.''
   A year ago, Mulie Jarju worked in a plaster factory as an
illegal alien from West Africa whose requests for work and
residence permits were repeatedly denied by authorities.
   Today, the 33-year-old native of Gambia is the star of a new
Spanish film about the lives of illegal African aliens and their
encounters with racism and exploitation.
   ``Letters from Alou'' won the top prize at the San Sebastian
Film Festival and Jarju received the best actor award, but he still
can't get a residence and work permit.
   The government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez
passed an Alien Residence Act in July 1985. It took effect the
following May and gave all illegal residents 10 months to apply for
legal residence and work permits. Only 38,000 applied.
   The number of aliens living legally in Spain has jumped over the
past decade from 181,000 to 400,000, according to Interior Ministry
figures. More than half are from other Western European countries.
   Government estimates put the number of illegal aliens in Spain,
a nation of 40 million, at between 70,000 and 140,000. More than
half are believed to be Moroccan. Non-governmental agencies dealing
with immigrants and refugees say the total number is closer to half
a million.
   Spain's lightly monitored frontiers, its physical proximity to
North Africa and its cultural ties with Latin America have become
issues in the 12-nation EC.
   In March, Spain will require visas for nationals of Morocco,
Tunisia and Algeria; Denmark will then be the only EC member that
does not require visas for North African nationals.
   But EC countries north of Spain still fear Madrid will not be
able to keep illegal immigrants from flooding into the rest of the
Community.
   In a recent interview in the French daily Le Monde, Gonzalez
said border controls were not sufficient to stem the tide of
illegal immigration. He also expressed particular sympathy for
North Africans.
   ``If I were between 18 and 25 and lived on the other side of the
Mediterranean today with an income 10 times lower than the European
minimum wage, there would be no frontiers. I would get by them
all.''
   Interior Minister Jose Luis Corcuera has expressed concern about
signs of growing racism and xenophobia in Spain, a country with a
historically tiny non-European population.
   Other government officials are expressing concern privately over
rapidly increasing immigration from Eastern Europe.
   ``More than 1,000 Poles a week are arriving,'' one said. ``We're
extremely worried about the dimension this could take.''
   As a signatory of the 1951 Geneva Convention on Refugees, Spain
is obliged to receive foreigners who seek refuge for political
reasons and see they are paid a stipend until their cases have been
decided.
   Both government authorities and private relief agencies agree
that most asylum seekers show up in Spain for economic, not
political reasons.
   But the snail-paced bureaucratic process of reviewing individual
requests for asylum allows many immigrants to slip through the
cracks and into the underground economy where they find jobs in
construction, garment sweatshops and in fields and orchards picking
fruit and vegetables.
   Since the summer about 150 Africans awaiting decisions on their
asylum petitions have been sleeping in a Madrid park or in
abandoned buildings because no one will rent them rooms.
   Since coming to Spain six years ago, Jarju has picked fruit,
carted junk, sold trinkets and sewed shirts in an illegal
sweatshop. His experiences served as a basis for the film.

   A financially troubled presidential commission
planning the 500th anniversary celebration of Columbus' 1492 voyage
to America faces a congressional investigation and a search for a
new chairman.
   John Goudie of Miami resigned Monday as head of the Christopher
Columbus Quincentenary Jubilee Commission out of what his deputy
said was a sense of frustration.
   Goudie was a fund-raiser for the unsuccessful re-election effort
of Florida Gov. Bob Martinez, who is President Bush's nominee as
director of national drug control policy. He was appointed to the
commission by former President Reagan.
   The commission is $600,000 in arrears on an agreement to pay
Spain for replicas of Columbus' three ships. The ships are to tour
American ports for the celebration.
   Texaco Inc., which has pledged $5 million, stopped its donations
in September because of ``some technical matters and overall
management of the program,'' Texaco spokesman K. Peter Maneri said
Tuesday. He said the company hopes the problems, which he refused
to detail, can be worked out and financial support resumed.
   Another potential sponsor, Chrysler Corp., says it wants to
clear up unspecified contractual questions before making a donation
of more than $1 million.
   A House Post Office and Civil Service subcommittee, meanwhile,
is delving into Goudie's longtime friendship with Manuel Gonzalez,
a Miami businessmen who has been involved in plans for the
celebration.
   A businessman, Peter Dunev of Miami, paid $50,000 for the right
to place the 500th anniversary logo on T-shirts. Gonzalez came by
Dunev's office last summer to pick up the checks for the $50,000,
Dunev said in an interview.
   The checks were made out to Christopher Columbus Licensing Group
Inc. of Miami and New York. The commission has awarded the
licensing group a contract enabling it to keep 85 percent of
commission-related sales on T-shirts and souvenirs.
   Bill Rolen, a Knoxville, Tenn., businessman who had made a
proposal for the celebration, said Goudie introduced him to
Gonzalez as a friend who might be able to provide Rolen with
financing
   Rolen said the two didn't do business because Gonzalez wanted
part ownership in Rolen's proposed venture. It was to have been a
renovation of a former world's fair exposition hall in Knoxville
for the Columbus celebration.
   Gonzalez did not return telephone calls to his home and office
in Miami. Goudie also couldn't be reached.
   However, the commission's deputy director, Jana Joustra, said
Goudie's resignation from the non-salaried, part-time post was
``completely voluntary.'' She said Goudie ``got fed up'' with the
problems, the lack of financial support and the criticism he faced
after spending a great deal of his own time on the project.
   ``Nobody appreciated it,'' she said.
   Congress appropriates $212,000 a year for the commission to pay
part of the salaries and rent for the six-member staff.
   The congressional subcommittee's investigation of the commission
will continue, said the panel's chairman, Rep. Thomas Sawyer,
D-Ohio.

   Anthony Palmer and Marvin Scott were the lucky

   At least five young people have been killed in the past four
weeks in the New York City area by thieves who wanted their trendy
coats.
   Palmer, 22, was grazed by a bullet Sunday after he refused to
hand over his jacket to four men as he left a party. The men fled
without the jacket.
   Twenty-year-old Scott was shot in the leg at 3 a.m. Sunday
trying to run away from a gunman who demanded his goosedown jacket.
He limped to a hospital.
   Police say two coats have become popular targets for thieves: A
jacket that has a billiard ball in multicolored leather patches and
a white sheepskin collar, and coats made of shearling leather,
preferably three-quarters length.
   ``It's become the in thing,'' said Lt. James Malvey. ``Years ago
it was bomber jackets. Now it's leather jackets. Nothing's changed
but the fashion.''
   About 20 people have survived such attacks, police said. At
least five others died.
   Malvey said Edward Dobbinson, 19, was charged with murder in the
shooting death of an unidentified youth over an 8-Ball brand jacket
on Dec. 10.
   Rashid Smith, 17, wore his 8-Ball jacket to a party Dec. 7. His
coatless body was later found by partygoers. No arrests have been
made.
   On nearby Long Island, Michael Wise, 22, of Hempstead, died Dec.
7, a day after he was shot in the back when he refused to give up
his $350 leather coat. The gunmen fled without his coat.
   Nicholas Best, 16, was fatally shot Dec. 3 when he ran to help a
friend against two muggers demanding his Chicago Bulls leather and
suede jacket.
   Bernard Richardson was shot Nov. 26 while walking to a store
with two friends who wore expensive shearling coats. When they
refused to give up the coats, the robber opened fire, killing
Richardson.

   The nation's first ban on pet
breeding has become law, and owners of show animals promise a
dogfight to overturn it.
   San Mateo County's breeding ban, which requires that most pets
be spayed or neutered, received final approval Tuesday.
   Opponents campaigned for a last-minute reversal before the Board
of Supervisors voted 3-1 in favor of the law designed to reduce the
number of strays put to death in the county just south of San
Francisco.
   Under the law, breeders who obtain permits would be able to
continue furthering bloodlines, but that's not enough for some show
dog owners.
   ``The whole thing is going to end up an enormous legal battle,''
said Susan Clough of Redwood City, a show dog owner picketing with
her dog Loree.
   ``The intent was never to go after any group of people but to
rectify an untenable situation in which we kill 10,000 pets a
year,'' said Supervisor Tom Nolan, author of the measure.
   The ordinance bans breeding by private dog and cat owners for
six months starting in July. By 1992, only dogs and cats owned by
professional and hobby breeders holding permits will be allowed to
reproduce.
   All other cats and dogs will have to be spayed or neutered.
   Violators face a $500 fine. The cost of the permit and other
details have not been worked out.
   The ordinance affects only unincorporated areas amounting to
about 10 percent of the county's population of 628,000. It would
not affect such cities as South San Francisco, Redwood City, San
Mateo and Menlo Park.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - The apparent choice of a leftist
priest as Haiti's first democratically elected president may be a
historical phenomenon, but is not a complete surprise.
   The poor multitudes that voted for the Rev. Jean-Bertrand
Aristide on Sunday have traditionally found haven - and inspiration
- in churches.
   In the 37-year-old Aristide, believers saw a prophet who could
end the political murders, torture and corruption perpetrated by a
series of repressive dictatorships.
   Even people who lack electricity managed to have a battery-run
radio to tune in to his sermons broadcast on Catholic radio
throughout this mountainous Caribbean nation of 5 million.
   Roman Catholicism, voodoo and Protestant missionaries have
played key roles throughout the turbulent 186-year history of
Haiti, the world's first black republic.
   But in recent history, politically oriented leftist offshoots of
Catholicism had perhaps the greatest popular influence.
   Such sects blossomed during the late 1970s, when Haiti was ruled
by the Duvalier family. At the time, hundreds of young priests,
nuns and layworkers moved away from the traditional church, forming
grassroots organizations in slums and among the peasantry.
   Opposition parties were banned and Haiti's bishops either
praised the dictatorship or were silent.
   ``The people were beginning to see their bishops as authority
figures and beginning in some cases to associate that authority
with the authority of the hated regime'' wrote Amy Wilentz in her
book, ``The Rainy Season''.
   The new religious movement was called the Parish of the Poor -
or Little Church - and stemmed from Liberation Theology, which
advocates that the church become politically active to improve the
lot of the poor.
   Liberation Theology was rapidly spreading in Latin America and
its adherents in Haiti were speaking out against the violence and
overwhelming poverty the nation's people were enduring under the
Duvaliers.
   In 1983, Pope John Paul II visited Haiti and admonished the
nation's rulers, boosting the efforts of the Little Church.
   The Duvalierist regime, enforced by a private militia of thugs
called the Tonton Macoutes, began in 1957 with the rise to power of
the late ``Papa Doc'' Francois Duvalier.
   It ended after mass protests forced his son, Jean-Claude
Duvalier, into exile in France in 1986.
   ``The opposition to Duvalier was expressed in these churches,''
said Jean-Claude Bajeaux, a widely respected human rights activist.
``It was a place where fears and anger toward the Macoutes could be
expressed.''
   It was largely inside the yellow St. Jean-Bosco church, located
on the edge of a slum, that the young, fiery and charismatic
Aristide berated the regime in Biblical terms.
   ``Aristide was a priest who used the poetic words of the Bible
to speak out against Duvalier,'' said Laennec Hurbon, a Caribbean
religion expert and author.
   ``He was a Moses whose mission was to save these people from the
devils - the devils being the Macoutes,'' said Bajeaux.
   Ordained a Salesian priest in 1982, Aristide was given at the
beginning the go-ahead by the conservative order to battle against
Duvalier. But as his congregation grew larger, the Salesians backed
off their support.
   ``In their view, he was leaning too much to the left,'' said
Hurbon.
   In 1988 he was expelled from the order for preaching ``class
struggle.''
   ``The crime of which I stand accused of is the crime of
preaching food for all people,'' Aristide wrote in his book ``In
the Parish of the Poor.''
   ``That is what the Salesians and the Haitian bishops and the
Vatican call politics,'' he wrote.
   Many conservatives interpret liberation theologians' efforts to
organize the poor as Marxism, and U.S. officials have privately
expressed fears that Aristide could try to turn Haiti into another
Cuba.
   For their part, holdovers of the Duvalier regime have vowed to
prevent ``an ultra-communist'' from taking power.
   ``Liberation theology has been misunderstood. It is just reading
Exodus,'' which tells the story of the emancipaton of Jews, said
George Price, prime minister of Belize and one of some 800
observers for Sunday's elections.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, a born-again Christian, agreed.
Carter, who also monitored the elections, said he respects their
``the social commitment.''
   Aristide remains a priest but is barred from saying Mass in
public. He has said he will renounce the priesthood if the Vatican,
which has a policy against priests holding public office, asks him
to.
   ``The title of priest is just a title. Jesus was not a priest,''
he said last week. ``I continue to preach the same truth without
Mass.''
   International and U.S. observers predict he will win with more
than 60 percent of the vote. The vote count is expected to be
complete by week's end.
   ``Aristide's popularity is not so much because he is a priest.
He had that something, because there were other priests doing the
same things. But they didn't have his popularity,'' said Laennec.
``He stood for change.''
   The Roman Catholic-run Radio Soleil, where many of Aristide's
sermons were broadcast, was also his pulpit, reaching thousands in
the countryside who had no electricity or running water but owned
battery-run radios.
   The radio was often shot at and forced off the air, but along
with Radio Haiti-Inter, Radio Soleil was the only source of news
that reported human rights violations and corruption.

<HEAD>Inflatable Sunglasses Wrapped Around Opera House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL ALEXANDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Opera House sported a huge pair of
sunglasses for about an hour today, put there clandestinely by the
environmental group Greenpeace to demonstrate concern about ozone
depletion.
   The inflatable sunglasses - 70 feet wide by 20 feet high - were
placed across the largest of the building's seven sail-like roof
peaks.
   An acompanying banner read: ``Ozone Depletion: stop it or we'll
go blind.''
   A portable generator inflated the glasses at about 6:30 a.m. and
they stayed in place for about an hour until police pulled the
plug. That made them visible to many of the commuters coming across
the harbor in ferries.
   Greenpeace spokeswoman Karla Bell said the stunt was designed
carefully to prevent any damage to the Opera House. The activists
all were experienced climbers, including two who have reached the
top of Mt. Everest.
   All seven were arrested after rappelling down the Opera House,
but were later released without charge.
   Scientists say they have found evidence of a hole in the ozone
layer over Antarctica that appears each year. Ozone filters out
cancer-causing ultraviolet radiation from the sun.
   Greenpeace is calling for a speedy phase out of
chlorofluorocarbons, man-made gases believed to cause the ozone
layer's depletion.
   Chloroflourocarbons are principally used in refrigeration and
air-conditioning, and Ms. Bell said there has not been enough
movement to switch to safer alternatives.
   ``Australia is at the forefront of continuing ozone depletion,
which threatens our health and way of life,'' Ms. Ball said.
   She contended that, ``for every 1 percent of ozone depletion,
100,000 people worldwide will lose their sight.
   ``Australia has the highest rate of skin cancer anywhere in the
world; continued ozone depletion will be responsible for a
significant increase in these cancers.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-three states have sued the only U.S.
manufacturer of a schizophrenia drug, accusing the company of
violating antitrust law in requiring patients to pay for expensive
monitoring for side effects.
   The lawsuits were filed in federal court here Tuesday against
Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. of East Hanover, N.J., and Caremark
Inc. of Lincolnshire, Ill., which has an exclusive contract with
Sandoz to do the monitoring.
   According to the lawsuits, Sandoz charges $172 a week, or $8,944
a year, for the drug Clozaril and the blood monitoring. In Germany,
where the drug is not tied to other services, patients pay $1,666
each year, the lawsuits said.
   ``Removing this unlawful, anti-competitive tie between the sale
of Clozaril and the monitoring package can improve the lives of
thousands of people suffering from schizophrenia,'' said Minnesota
Attorney General Hubert Humphrey III.
   Sandoz has said the monitoring is needed to check for a
potentially fatal side effect, agranulocytosis, that reduces the
level of infection-fighting white blood cells. Caremark vice
president Jim Mieszala said the monitoring is fairly priced.
   New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams said the safety
claims were merely ``camouflage'' for anti-competitive practices.
   ``The issue in this case is simply whether Sandoz or the
patients' own doctors should choose how to monitor their patients'
use of Clozaril,'' he said.
   Sandoz spokeswoman Maria Sweeney said the company is trying to
reduce the drug's price.
   The drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration last
year and Sandoz began marketing it in the United States in
February.
   The lawsuits seek a court order requiring Sandoz to sell
Clozaril and its generic equivalent, clozapine, without the blood
monitoring services; end Sandoz's exclusive marketing rights, and
award damages to the states.
   In addition to Minnesota and New York, attorneys general from
the following states also sued: California, Colorado, Connecticut,
Florida, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee,
Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
   Schizophrenia is a disorder often characterized by a distorted
sense of reality, delusions, hallucinations, personality
fragmentation and bizarre behavior.

<TEXT>
   A 53-member business coalition is trying to
energize Americans to oppose toughened federal automobile fuel
economy standards on grounds they would inhibit lifestyles.
   ``It will limit what consumers can buy,'' said Greg Dana, vice
president of the Association of International Automobile
Manufacturers.
   The domestic and foreign auto industries organized the Coalition
for Vehicle Choice to demonstrate that the battle over fuel economy
is not simply a fight between automakers and environmentalists,
said Jeffrey B. Conley, the coalition's executive director.
   Among the coalition's members are groups representing farmers,
iron and steel manufacturers, electrical contractors, police chiefs
and cattlemen. All recognize that a proposal to require new-car
fleets to average 40 miles per gallon by the year 2001 could cost
jobs and money, Conley said.
   Dan Becker, spokesman for the Sierra Club, dismissed the
coalition as a ploy to mask Detroit's predominant role in
opposition to the tougher standards.
   ``They're wrong if they think a phony coalition is going to help
them win,'' Becker said Tuesday. ``People recognize that fuel
efficiency is the key to curbing global warming and freeing us from
having to send troops to the Middle East to fight for our energy
security.''
   The issue will be debated next year in Congress.

   The reduction, about $33 million in annual revenue to the
company, reflects lower fees that will be paid to local telephone
companies for access to customers' telephone lines, AT&amp;T said
Tuesday.
   Basic customer-dialed long-distance calls by individuals and

   Some other reductions:
   -Some calls to Mexico and calls from Hawaii to 17 countries or
geographic areas will be cheaper.
   -Calls to the former East Germany will be reduced to the same

<HEAD>Not Many Drug Users In Aviation, FAA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fewer than one-half percent of more than
120,000 recent drug tests in the aviation industry showed the
presence of drugs, says the Federal Aviation Administration.
   The tests were conducted among commercial aviation employees
ranging from pilots to airport security screening personnel as well
as people applying for such safety or security sensitive jobs, the
FAA said.
   An analysis of the 120,642 tests showed drugs in 561, just 0.47
percent of the total, the FAA said Tuesday. Of the 561, 345 were in
pre-employment tests, and those people were not hired for sensitive
jobs.
   Employees who tested positive were removed from sensitive
positions, the agency said.
   John Mazor, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association, said
the analysis bore out ``what we have been saying all along, that
they were not going to find any significant amount of drug abuse by
airline pilots.''
   ``We would hope that the government and industry would refocus
their efforts away from heavy-handed methods,'' Mazor said.
   Some 538,000 aviation industry employees are subject to drug
testing - before employment, at random or periodically on the job,
after accidents and whenever there is reasonable cause to suspect
drug abuse.
   Included are pilots, mechanics, flight attendants, airport
security screening personnel and aircraft dispatchers.
   A breakdown of the test results that showed drug use among both
applicants and employees revealed 18 pilots or other flight crew
members, 116 flight attendants, 300 maintenance personnel, 48
aircraft dispatchers, 41 security personnel, five flight
instructors, and four private air traffic control personnel.
Twenty-nine persons were not identified by job function.
   Of the positive tests, 346 were attributed to marijuana use, 196
to cocaine, 13 to opiates, one to the use of PCP, and 15 to
amphetamine use. Those numbers add to more than 561 because of
multiple drug use by some people tested.

<HEAD>Drug Cartel Leader Surrenders To Authorities, Could Be First Of
Hundreds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN GUTKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In what could be the first step toward a
mass surrender of hundreds of drug traffickers, a cocaine baron
wanted in the United States on drug and murder charges has turned
himself in under a leniency plan.
   The program is aimed at ending a war between the government and
the traffickers that has left hundreds of people dead.
   Fabio Ochoa Vasquez, 33, the youngest of three brothers who help
run the Medellin cocaine cartel, surrendered Tuesday to a court
official in a church south of Medellin, Colombia's second largest
city, officials said.
   He was the first cartel leader to accept a government offer of
no extradition and reduced prison sentences to drug traffickers who
surrender.
   U.S. officials, in their request for Ochoa's extradition, say he
once managed the cartel's cocaine distribution network in Miami.
They say Ochoa is also accused of having ordered the 1986 murder of
Barry Seal, an informant for the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration.
   Ochoa's surrender came just one day after the government offered
new enticements to drug barons who turn themselves in.
   ``I hope this contributes in the best way to peace and
understanding in Colombia,'' Ochoa said, referring to his surrender
in a statement released by his family.
   A prison official said Ochoa was in good health and was being
held in a jail in the Medellin suburb of Itaqui.
   Ochoa is taking advantage of two government decrees, one issued
on Monday, that prohibit extraditions and offer lenient judicial
treatment to surrendering traffickers.
   In late November, the cartel said that between 200 and 300 drug
traffickers were willing to surrender in return for legal
guarantees.
   In its decree Monday, the government granted the cartel's
demands for human rights safeguards and the preparation of heavily
guarded jails.
   Jaime Cordoba, the attorney general's human rights coordinator,
said human rights delegates were being appointed to oversee Ochoa's
surrender.
   President Cesar Gaviria, who took office in August, told
reporters he was pleased with the results of the decrees he issued
in a bid to secure the surrender of leading traffickers.
   ``The government is very satisfied that (its decrees) are having
all the effects they should have in Colombian life,'' Gaviria said,
speaking over the Caracol radio network.
   In the past month, four mid-level traffickers have accepted
Gaviria's offer and turned themselves in.
   The decrees have exposed the president to intense criticism from
foreign diplomats, the press and local politicians who say the
government is going soft in the drug war.
   But the government insists its policies will lead cocaine
traffickers to serve time in Colombia instead of relying on U.S.
courts to prosecute Colombian drug criminals.
   In the past, drug barons have threatened, bribed or killed
Colombian judges and prison authorities to obtain their freedom.
   ``We are sure that all (of the traffickers) will find it much
easier to surrender than to continue a sterile fight that produces
only pain and death,'' Justice Minister Jaime Giraldo told
reporters Tuesday evening.
   The Medellin gang has been blamed for killing around 550
Colombians since the government and traffickers declared war on
each other in August 1989, when a prominent presidential candidate
was assassinated.
   It was not clear if Ochoa's brothers, Jorge Luis and Juan David,
were also planning to turn themselves in. The cartel's top leader,
Pablo Escobar, also remains at large.
   Fabio Ochoa's statement indicated that other drug kingpins may
demand further guarantees before surrendering.
   He said the recent decrees ``were a long way from satisfying the
dreams and expectations raised by the government.''

<TEXT>
   A Chinese student trying to ensure justice for a
jailed pro-democracy activist left today for the United States,
ending a frustrating trip with no new information about his
friend's case.
   Ge Xun, 31, came to China after hearing reports that Wang Juntao
would stand trial soon for his involvement in last year's
pro-democracy movement.
   Ge said he wanted to attend court proceedings to make sure Wang
was treated fairly. But he was stonewalled by Chinese officials,
and decided to cut short his trip after 10 days because of pressure
from family members concerned about his safety.
   ``I am not so satisfied with the trip. Probably I could do a
little more by continuing here,'' he said. ``But I will follow the
developments from the United States and write letters to Chinese
authorities to let them know people care about Wang Juntao.''
   Chinese sources say Wang and a colleague, Chen Ziming, have been
charged with sedition, a crime that could bring the death penalty.
Wang was the editor of a now-banned economic studies weekly and
Chen was the publisher.
   They have been accused of manipulating students who led protests
last year urging democratic reforms.
   The Chinese army violently suppressed the pro-democracy movement
in June 1989, killing hundreds of people. Thousands were arrested
in a nationwide crackdown on dissent that followed.
   Ge said he was sent from office to office and followed by
undercover security agents when he tried to get information about
Wang.
   ``Finally, I was told the case is still under investigation,''
he said.
   At the Beijing Public Security Bureau, officials quizzed Ge
about his background.
   ``They wanted to know why my friend is more important to me than
my family,'' Ge said. ``I told them my family is important to me,
but at least they are free.''
   Ge said he asked public security officials if Wang is still
alive.
   ``They got very upset about this,'' he said. ``They said his
family members know about him and that it is not necessary to
explain this to me.''
   Trials in China are closed except to a few invited people who
often do not include family or friends. There is a presumption that
the defendant would not have been arrested unless guilty.
   Defense lawyers usually confine their arguments to pleas for
leniency based on the defendant's lack of a criminal record or a
``good attitude.'' Sentences may be reduced if the defendant admits
guilt.
   Ge, who is working on a doctorate in physics at Texas A&amp;M
University, said he and Wang became close friends after they met in
1982 while working at the Institute of Atomic Energy.
   Ge has been in the United States since 1986 and has not seen
Wang for five years.
   He said he has not decided if he will come to China again to
continue seeking justice for Wang.
   ``I'm going to watch the reports. I just want to make sure
everything is fair,'' he said.
   Ge said he considered trying to discuss Wang's case with Richard
Schifter, U.S. assistant secretary of state for human rights.
Schifter, who met with Chinese officials today and Tuesday,k was
expected to seek lenient treatment for people jailed following last
year's pro-democracy movement.
   ``I think maybe his trip is too sensitive and I don't want to
complicate things,'' Ge said.

   De Niro was honored for his role as a patient who comes out of a

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - ``The Tonight Show'' is heading east from
beautiful downtown Burbank to the Big Apple for New Year's Eve,
with comedian Jay Leno ringing in 1991 from Times Square.
   The live, one-time-only broadcast marks the show's first return
to New York since it moved to California in 1972. The program will
feature Leno as guest host, newswoman Jane Pauley, blues guitarist
B.B. King and country star Dwight Yoakum.
   NBC said more 3,000 viewers have requested tickets for the
hour-long special, which will count down the dropping of an
ornamental big apple in Times Square.

   Quarterback Joe Montana, who has led
the San Francisco 49ers to four Super Bowl victories, was named the
Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year for 1990.
   The 34-year-old Montana on Tuesday became the first National
Football League player to be the sole recipient of the award, given
to the athlete who symbolizes in character and performance the
ideals for sportsmanship.
   Montana was honored because he has ``defined his sport in his
era,'' said John Papanek, managing editor of the magazine.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Sean Connery says his new post-Cold War
thriller, ``The Russia House,'' offers a picture of the Soviet
Union rarely seen in the movies.
   The espionage tale based on the John Le Carre best seller
dispenses with Bond-style superspy action and spins the tale of a
boozy English publisher caught in a web of international intrigue.
   The 60-year-old actor said he hopes the film encourages younger
people to learn more about the Soviet Union.
   ``My assistant has a 20-year-old daughter who really knows
nothing about the Cold War and such. After she saw the film, she
was absolutely taken with Russia. The response by most Americans
who've seen the film is that they have never seen Russia presented
like that,'' he said.
   The film was shot in the Soviet Union, with cooperation from the
government.
   Le Carre's novel preceded the easing of the Cold War.

   All Nippon Airways, Japan's second biggest airline,
said today that it will order 25 Boeing-777 airliners from the
United States and 10 European Airbus A-340s, a total package worth
$5.6 billion.
   An ANA official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
contracts will be signed early next year with Boeing Co. for 15
firm orders and 10 options for delivery between 1995 and 2000.
   He said the planes, with 411 seats each, will be used on
domestic routes.
   The official said ANA also will sign contracts early next year
with Airbus consortium for five firm orders and five options for
delivery between 1996 and 2000.
   The A-340 planes, with 236 seats, will be used on international
routes, he said.
   The official said both types of plane will cost about $150
million each, and replacement engines and other related equipment
could bring the value of the total package to some $5.6 billion.
   ANA now has a fleet of 105 aircraft, including 44 Boeing 767s,
14 Boeing 737s, 17 Boeing 747-SRs, five Boeing 747-LRs, two Boeing
747-400s, 11 Lockheed TriStars and 12 Japanese YS-11s.

<HEAD>Stocks Up In Tokyo, Dollar Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tokyo share prices rose sharply today in heavy
trading after a key interest rate was cut in the United States,
while the dollar edged up against the Japanese yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
gained 452.76 points, or 1.85 percent, closing at 24,876.78 points.
On Tuesday, the Nikkei gained 336.11 points.
   Trading volume on the first section was estimated at 620 million
shares, up from Tuesday's 382 million.
   Share prices rose in response to the U.S. Federal Reserve
Board's decision Tuesday to lower its discount rate - the rate it
charges for loans to banks - from 7 percent to 6.5 percent, traders
said.
   The market had anticipated the change, but rising prices of
interest rate-sensitive stocks buoyed the market anyway, traders
said.
   ``There's a slightly stronger perception that market rates are
headed down,'' said Brad Bauer, an equities sales broker for
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities (Japan).
   The heavy volume was a good indication of investor conviction,
he said.
   Some traders thought the market might be starting its
traditional year-end rally.
   ``I think this year-end rally could carry us considerably higher
if the yen strengthens against the dollar,'' said John Baldwin, a
strategist at Jardine Fleming Securities.
   In currency trading, the dollar closed at 133.27 yen, up 0.24
yen from Tuesday's close of 133.03 yen. It opened at 132.70 yen and
ranged between 132.63 yen and 133.43 yen.
   Spot trading amounted to $7.23 billion, up from Tuesday's $3.6
billion.
   The negative impact of the U.S. discount rate cut was countered
by year-end dollar purchases, including those by hundreds of
thousands of Japanese planning to travel overseas during the
holidays, dealers said.
   ``No one wants to take a huge position before going away for
Christmas,'' said a dealer at the Bank of Tokyo, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Dealers said uncertainty in the Middle East also was encouraging
dollar-buying. Many investors seek the dollar as a safe haven in
times of international turmoil.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 88.23 points from Tuesday's
88.18-point close. Their yield stood at 7.020 percent, down from
7.030 percent on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Prostitutes Coming Back to Mustang Ranch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM GARDNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIRGINIA CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former owner of Nevada's most
notorious legal bordello says the red light is back on at the
Mustang Ranch, but county commissioners aren't so sure.
   The Storey County Commission had planned Tuesday to debate
whether to let prostitution continue at the 104-room brothel under
new ownership when former owner Joe Conforte announced his permit
for operating the place is still valid.
   ``We reopened this morning,'' Conforte told the three-member
panel. ``I'm not here to ask for a license. I'm here as a common
courtesy to this board to tell you how it is.''
   The commission took no immediate action, deciding to seek an
opinion from the state attorney general's office on Conforte's
status.
   Sheriff Bob Del Carlo said prostitutes were moving back into the
brothel on Tuesday but could not begin work again until they had
been tested for sexually transmitted disease and issued health
cards by his office.
   The Internal Revenue Service had seized the ranch from Conforte
and sold it in November to recoup some $13 million in taxes owed by
him and his wife. Under the new owner - Conforte's lawyer, Peter
Perry - Conforte became general manager.
   Commission Chairman Larry Prater said he felt Conforte had lost
his permit because of the sale.
   But Conforte said he paid the county $15,000 for a quarterly
license fee two weeks ago plus a $1,500 late charge.
   When the IRS sold the 400-acre ranch the county lost revenues
from its $60,000 annual license fee and a 2 percent tax on its
rooms. Two commissioners indicated earlier this month that the
county was having second thoughts about losing the money.
   Conforte on Tuesday offered to increase the quarterly fee to
$35,000 and provide a school bus to the county. He angrily denied
his offers were meant to win a favorable decision.
   ``It was strictly a benevolence, because I have a big heart,''
he said.
   Perry said because of building code deficiencies, operations
would resume only at the Triangle River Ranch, a smaller building
at the Mustang Ranch compound. The larger Mustang Bridge Ranch will
remain closed.
   Perry is listed with the state as the sole officer of the
ranch's new owner, Mustang Properties Inc.
   After padlocking the brothel, the IRS sold the Mustang Ranch's
contents at auction in November.

   NBC had seven of the top 10 shows in the
latest ratings, with ``Cheers'' grabbing more viewers than any
other TV program last week.
   A bag full of holiday specials failed to make the top 20,
according to figures released Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   Even NBC's ``Bob Hope's Christmas Special'' from Bermuda was
left out in the cold. It ranked 22nd. A repeat, colorized version
of CBS' ``I Love Lucy Christmas'' tied for 30th with the movie
``The Witches of Eastwick'' on ABC.
   NBC's Tuesday night lineup helped the network to first place
with a 12.4 average rating for the week, followed by ABC with an
11.6 and CBS with 11.4. Each ratings point represents 931,000
television homes.
   ``In The Heat of The Night,'' ``Matlock'' and ``Law &amp; Order''
each won their Tuesday time periods and landed in the top 20 for
the first time in the 13-week-old season.
   CBS' ``60 Minutes'' was the No. 2 show, followed by a tie for
third place between NBC's ``A Different World'' and ABC's NFL
``Monday Night Football'' match-up between the Los Angeles Raiders
and the Detroit Lions.
   The network news victory went once again to ABC and Peter
Jennings with an 11.6. CBS and Dan Rather had a 10 and NBC and Tom
Brokaw a 9.9.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating: ``Cheers,''
NBC, 22.6; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 20.6; ``A Different World,'' NBC
and ``Monday Night Football,'' ABC (tie) 18.2; ``Empty Nest,'' NBC,

   Survivors of a crash between a bus and a
tractor-trailer that killed seven people in a howling snowstorm
lifted each other from the wreckage and broke open luggage for
blankets and clothing to use as bandages.
   Forty-four people were injured in Tuesday morning's crash on an
isolated, snowy stretch of Interstate 80 near the Wyoming line.
   Passengers said the Greyhound bus driver had only enough time to
warn, ``You better hold on, folks,'' as the truck carrying frozen
hams slid across the divided highway and plowed into the bus and
another big rig loaded with sand.
   Seven of the 43 passengers on the Salt Lake City-to-Chicago bus
were killed, said Highway Patrol Sgt. Gary Whitney.
   Passengers Stuart Palmer, 38, of Buffalo, N.Y., said riders sat
helplessly as the truck knocked the bus about 35 feet down an
embankment and onto its side.
   He said he kicked out part of the windshield and began helping
those who could walk up the embankment until his own broken ankle
gave out.
   Palmer said it was 30 to 45 minutes before emergency vehicles
arrived amid icy winds and snow. He gave his coat to a badly
injured passenger. ``We were breaking bags open to get out blankets
and make makeshift bandages,'' he said.
   A witness, Blaine Whimpe of Morgan, said he saw people ``up on
top of the bus pulling people out. Everybody that came out of the
bus that I had seen was hurt, broken arms, legs.''
   Forty-one people, some injured in chain-reaction accidents after
the initial crash, were taken to Evanston Regional Hospital in
Wyoming. Fourteen were admitted, most with broken bones, and one
was listed in critical condition today.
   Three people with head injuries were flown to hospitals in Salt
Lake City and were listed in critical condition.
   Authorities searched passengers' luggage to identify the
victims.
   The National Transportation Safety Board and National Highway
Safety Board said they would investigate the cause of the crash.
   The temperature at the time was 22 degrees. The National Weather
Service said the wind was gusting to 29 mph at Evanston, Wyo.,
about 10 miles away.
   The truck carrying the hams was owned by Wanship Enterprises of
Salt Lake City. Wanship's owner, Mike Peery, said the driver,
Robert Williams, 46, of Salt Lake, said he wasn't sure how the
accident occurred. But he said Williams might have been trying to
avoid another vehicle when he lost control of his truck.
   Williams was reported in fair condition at Evanston Regional
Hospital today. The driver of the other truck and the bus, who were
not identified, were not seriously hurt.

<HEAD>Two Studies Look at Cholesterol in Women, Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children with dangerously high cholesterol won't
necessarily have the problem later in life, scientists reported
today in a study they said casts doubt on the need for cholesterol
screening of all youngsters.
   The authors of the study in the Journal of the American Medical
Association said univeral cholesterol screening for children would
be expensive and would fail to pinpoint which adults will continue
to show high cholesterol levels.
   In another study in today's journal, researchers said that
cholesterol-reducing drugs that help unclog men's coronary arteries
and reduce their risk of heart attack do the same for women as
well.
   Previous studies excluded women because men run a far higher
risk of coronary problems at earlier ages. Cholesterol kills by
clogging the blood vessels with lesions, a combination of fatty
deposits and scar tissue.
   ``There are lots of other risk factors besides cholesterol. But
one of the most important risk factors is high cholesterol, and
reversal of atherosclerosis can reduce the chances of a heart
attack,'' Dr. Mary Malloy, co-author of the study, said in a
telephone interview Tuesday.
   The study loked at 41 women and 31 men with atherosclerosis
over several years. Subjects took bile acid-binding resin and
niacin daily, which along with dietary changes reduced their
cholesterol levels an average of 38.1 percent.
   After 26 months, coronary artery lesions shrank more than 2
percent among 22 women enrolled in the treatment.
   The 19 other women, whose cholesterol levels were reduced an
average of 10.6 percent through diet changes and less-intensive
drug treatments, showed an average increase of slightly more than 1
percent in coronary artery lesions.
   The treatment's effect on men in the study showed the same
trends, but did not result in a statistically significant
difference among men, the study concluded.
   Dr. David Blankenhorn of the University of Southern California,
who was not involved in the study, said doctors are less likely to
prescribe cholesterol-reducing medicines for women because the
evidence on their effectiveness wasn't in.
   In the other study, the cholesterol levels of 2,367 children
between the ages of 8 and 18 in Muscatine, Iowa, were examined, and
their cholesterol levels were again measured between the ages of 20
and 30.
   Seventy-five percent of the females and 56 percent of the males
with high cholesterol as children were under the levels described
as dangerous by the National Cholesterol Education Program when
tested as adults, the study found.
   ``Childhood cholesterol levels are a poor predictor of high
cholesterol levels in young adulthood and will be an even poorer
predictor of coronary heart disease later in life,'' said the
study's authors, William R. Clarke and Dr. Ronald Lauer of the
University of Iowa.

<TEXT>
   A columnist and TV commentator who reports on
financial news says there is no ethical conflict between her work
and her appointment to the McDonald's Corp. board of directors.
   ``This won't be a problem,'' said Terry Savage, who writes a
weekly financial news column for the Chicago Sun-Times and Dallas
Times Herald and who appears regularly on Chicago station WBBM,
which is owned by CBS.
   Savage, 46, the first woman named to the company's board in 20
years, will receive $24,000 a year from McDonald's plus $2,000 for
each board meeting attended.
   Officials at the newspapers and TV station said Savage promised
to stay away from any issues that could be construed as conflicting
with her role on the McDonald's board.
   ``We will make sure she does not write about the food industry,
and McDonald's in particular,'' said Times Herald Business Editor
Jim Frisinger. But George Harmon, who teaches business writing at
Northwestern University's graduate school of journalism, said it
would be hard to avoid the apperance of a conflict because
McDonald's influences so much of the business world.
   He said Savage could be restricted from reporting on the beef,
potato and recycling industries and even the stock market because
McDonald's is among the 30 companies whose performances are
reflected in the Dow Jones industrials average.
   ``If somebody wanted to restrict Terry from reporting on
McDonald's and be very strict about that, it would restrain her
considerably,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A military court today convicted and
sentenced 79 soldiers to prison terms ranging up to 32 years for
their participation in a 1987 attempt to overthrow President
Corazon Aquino.
   Twenty others - 11 officers and nine enlisted men - were
acquitted of mutiny and murder charges in a court hearing that
began Tuesday afternoon and lasted until 4 a.m. today and ended a
three-year trial.
   Of the officers charged, Army Capt. Redempto Taisa, formerly of
the 62nd Army Infantry Battalion in central Luzon, and eight
enlisted personnel received the stiffest penalties.
   They were sentenced to 12 years for mutiny and 20 years for
murder and attempted murder for reinforcing rebel troops that
attacked the presidential palace on Aug. 28, 1987.
   Thirty-one other officers and six enlisted personnel were
sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment at hard labor. Thirty-three
enlisted personnel received 20-year sentences.
   The maximum sentence for each charge was 20 years. There is no
death penalty in the Philippines.
   Col. Ananiano Disierto, the military's chief prosecutor, said 81
witnesses and hundreds of photographs and other exhibits were
presented against the accused during the trial.
   Wives and children of the accused soldiers burst into tears as
the sentences were read by Brig. Gen. Raul Imperial, head of the
seven-man general court martial.
   Some of those convicted wept while those who were cleared of
charges clapped and shook hands with each other. They later offered
Christian songs and prayers.
   ``I have prepared my mind to expect for the worst - even the
death sentence if that's the worst penalty that would be given to
me,'' said Lt. Col. Jose Reynaldo Ochosa, 41, before the sentence
was read.
   Ochosa said he joined renegade soldiers not to topple Mrs.
Aquino's government but to show his protest against how she was
mismanaging the government.
   The rebellion, the fifth armed attempt to oust Mrs. Aquino, left
at least 53 people dead and about 300 others wounded, including
Mrs. Aquino's only son, Benigno III. Mrs. Aquino has survived two
other coup attempts since.

<TEXT>
   More than 1,000 people a day are flocking
to the back of an auto parts store, past the spark plugs and fan
belts, to see what many believe is an image of the Virgin Mary on
the bathroom floor.
   Each day as the multitudes arrive at Progreso Auto Supply in
this tiny Mexican border town, owner Reynaldo Trevino directs them
to the spot in the concrete of the shower stall, next to a toilet,
where thousands say they have seen the image of the mother of
Christ.
   ``She's so beautiful, so beautiful,'' 14-year-old Bonnie
Maldonado said Tuesday as tears streamed down her face.
   The foot-wide image is in varying shades of gray that Trevino
said used to be one shade. He said he first noticed it on Dec. 3.
   ``I asked her, `Why on the floor? Why the bathroom?''' Trevino
said.
   The 45-year-old Roman Catholic said something within his heart
told him to spread the message that the Virgin Mary's presence on
the floor symbolized the way many neglect their faith.
   ``So I started telling every customer who came in,'' he said.
``Before I sold them a part, I took them back.''
   Officials at the Roman Catholic Archdiocese in Brownsville have
declined to comment on the image.
   What could be interpreted as facial features are vaguely
discernible in the markings. Others have said they see even more,
including an earring, flowers and an angel to the side.
   As word of the site has spread through the Lower Rio Grande
Valley, more than 1,000 people a day have flocked to the store.
Most come only to see the image, and Trevino said his auto parts
business has suffered.
   But he said he welcomes them all, asking only that they leave no
money or other offerings.
   ``I don't want this to be commercialized or anything,'' he said.
   He also discourages the taking of photographs. ``I want them to
take the image home with them in their hearts,'' he said.
   Many of those who come to the store kneel to pray. Some make the
sign of the cross or touch the image.
   Ernestina Maldonado, 41, who lives in nearby Weslaco, said
seeing the image filled her with pain.
   ``We are in a very troubled world right now,'' she said. ``Maybe
it's a sign for people to think about it and repent because it's
getting real ugly in the world.''

May at the Israeli Knesset, or parliament. Prizes also will be
awarded for chemistry, medicine, physics, agriculture and
mathematics.
   The selection committee said the musicians were chosen ``for
bringing peoples together through their musical achievements.''
   Menuhin, 74, who was born in New York City and now lives in
London, was a prodigy violinist, making his debut at age 7 in San
Francisco.
   In addition to solo performances around the world, Menuhin has
founded his own chamber orchestra, directs the Gstaad Festival in
Switzerland, established a school for gifted musicians in Surrey,
England, and is president of the Trinity College of Music.
   The Wolf Foundation selection committee described him as ``one
of the greatest violinists of the 20th century'' and said: ``His
unforgettable interpretations and humanitarian activities
contributed significantly to bringing nations together through
musical education, enlightening peoples and elevating cultural
levels throughout the world.''
   He has been particularly active in promoting musical exchange
programs with the Soviet Union and India.
   Berio, 65, of Siena, Italy, was born to a family of musicians
and first studied music with his father and grandfather. He
composes, conducts, teaches and lectures.
   Berio is particularly noted for innovations in electronic music.
   He founded the Studio di Fonologia Musicale at the Italian Radio
in Milan and has been associated with numerous training centers,
including Darmstadt in Germany and Juilliard in New York.
   ``He is one of the greatest composers of our generation whose
new ideas, in an age of devaluation of human values, help to unify
nations, cultures and generations,'' the selection committee said.
   The prizes, which are given annually, are named for the late Dr.
Ricardo Wolf. Established in 1975, they are intended ``to promote
science and art for the benefit of mankind.''
   Wolf was a German-born inventor and philanthropist who emigrated
to Cuba and later served as its ambassador to Israel. He died in
1981.

   The Northwest endured blizzardlike conditions and bitter cold
today, rain fell in the East, and scattered snow flurries dusted
the western Great Lakes.
   Fair skies prevailed over much of the nation's midsection, with
some rain forecast for Southern California, the South and the
Eastern Seaboard. Daytime highs were expected to range from the 80s
in southern Texas to zero and below in North Dakota.
   A rare heavy snowfall blanketed downtown Seattle, where the
elevation is 125 feet. Winds topping 60 mph downed power lines and
snow drifts forced the closure of most schools.
   Snow and icy temperatures also hit Oregon, Utah, Idaho, Montana,
Wyoming, parts of Nevada and Northern California, and the Dakotas.
Wind chill indexes dropped the mercury to about 50 below zero in
the Pacific Northwest and to 70 below in the Montana and the
northern Plains.
   Elsewhere Tuesday, mid-December heat set Dec. 18 records in many
cities.
   Bluefield, W.Va., hit 69 degrees, topping a high of 59 set in
1967. Bristol Tenn. reached 73 degrees, beating the old mark of 65
set in 1949. Huntsville, Ala., peaked at 73, beating a 1984 record
by two degrees. Roanoke, Va., set a record by a degree with a high
of 68, edging a 1984 mark and Wilmington, Del., broke a record from
the same year by two degrees with a high of 66.
   Cape Hatteras, N.C., 72, Jacksonville, Fla., 81, and

<HEAD>Burmese Dissidents Declare Parallel Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRUNNSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burmese dissidents who were elected
seven months ago but kept from power by their country's military
rulers have announced the formation of a rival government.
   Headed by Sein Win, the cousin of Burma's detained opposition
leader Aung San Suu Kyi, the group on Tuesday announced an
eight-member Cabinet at Manerplaw, headquarters of ethnic Karen
insurgents near the Thai border.
   All eight men won parliamentary seats in the May 27 general
election. Ms. Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy won the
election by a landslide the government has refused to accept.
   Western diplomats have said it was unlikely any country would
recognize the parallel government. And a powerful member of Burma's
military government said in a newspaper interview published Tuesday
that forming a rival government ``would be a great mistake.''
   Sein Win was named prime minister of the ``National Coalition
Government of the Union of Burma.'' He said in a speech that
forming the body ``was the only option for us to choose because
this military junta has no will and no way to transfer power to the
people.''
   ``Burma has become a country shrouded by darkness because of all
the unlawful arrests, tortures and persecutions and human rights
violations,'' a declaration issued by the new government said.
   Copies were made available in Bangkok today.
   The declaration said the government stood for the immediate
elimination of the military government, the calling of a national
convention including members of the Parliament and insurgent
groups, and the establishment of a ``genuine democratic
government'' to create ``an independent, prosperous and modernized
Federal Union of Burma.''
   It named eight people to a Cabinet: Sein Win, Peter Lin Pin, Win
Ko, Than Kywe, Hla Pe, Thein Oo, Hla Tint and Tun Oo.
   Sein Win is a member of the National Democracy Party, while
Peter Lin Pin was an independent candidate in the election. The
others are members of the National League for Democracy.
   All fled the threat of arrest in Burma after their plans to form
a rival government became known.
   The Democratic Alliance of Burma, an umbrella organization of 21
ethnic and other rebel groups fighting the central government,
backed the declaration. The Karen are members of the alliance,
which has its headquarters in Manerplaw, located along the frontier
with Thailand, 120 miles northeast of Rangoon.
   The military took power by force in Burma in 1988.
   Soldiers killed thousands of people who joined in a nationwide
movement for democracy that year.
   The government has since detained most leading members of the
opposition. These include Ms. Suu Kyi, who was put under house
arrest in July 1989.
   Amnesty International and other human rights groups have cited
numerous reports of torture of dissidents by military agencies.

   When does calf liver become beef liver?
   That question will be raised in the trial of a meat-processing
company and four officials charged with conspiring to mislabel
meat, defense lawyer James Martin Davis said.
   The defense plans to show that even among livestock and meat
processing experts there is no agreement as to what a calf is,
Davis said Tuesday.
   ``In federal law and U.S. Department of Agriculture rules and
regulations, there is no definition of what is a calf,'' Davis
said.
   A federal grand jury indicted VMI Corp. and four officials Nov.
14 on a charge that they conspired to switch labels on 11.6 million
pounds of beef liver to more expensive calf liver.
   The company's president, board chairman, comptroller and plant
manager pleaded innocent Tuesday before U.S. Magistrate Richard
Kopf.

   The Oklahoma Supreme Court upheld the
landslide election of a dead judge against a living candidate,
saying the results must be interpreted as a vote against the loser.
   Incumbent Frank M. Ogden III, who died Aug. 11, won 91 percent
of the vote cast Nov. 6 in a race against Josh L. Evans, who had
challenged the results.
   ``It is beyond question that the will of the electorate was to
cast votes for Judge Ogden and against candidate Evans,'' the
Supreme Court said Tuesday.
   The result leaves the job open for an appointee of the governor.
   Evans, 74, ran a campaign for the Oklahoma Panhandle judgeship
that described him as an able lawyer and a living person.
   The court said Evans should have filed his challenge to the dead
man's candidacy before the election.

<TEXT>
   President Bush disputes the notion that
``there's some kind of racism'' involved in the makeup of the U.S.
military force in the Persian Gulf.
   ``I don't think this concept that this is a discriminatory army,
or an army that is discriminating and thus sending more blacks to
the fate, or minorities, Hispanics or something, is proper,'' Bush
told a group of regional reporters Tuesday.
   He was replying to a question that suggested a disproportionate
number of the troops he has sent to the Middle East are from
minority or working-class groups.
   ``This is an all-volunteer army. They're not draft-dodging,''
the president said.
   The situation was different during the Vietnam war, Bush said.
   ``The kid that got disproportionately there was the guy that
couldn't get the (draft) exemption and came out of kind of the
lower rungs of society,'' he said. ``This is different.''
   Critics say that although the draft was abolished 17 years ago,
the volunteer armed forces are composed disproportionately of
minorities and the poor who join because they see the military as a
way to get the education and job that they might not otherwise
attain.
   On another matter, Bush said he still would like to see the
capital gains tax rate reduced, but indicated he was wary of
reopening the tax battle with Democrats in Congress.
   ``I'm a little worried, I'll be honest with you, having laid
this tax question down for a while, to reopen many, many aspects of
it,'' he said.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said in an interview he was
recommending against trying again for such a tax cut next year
because he believes it would result in a fight with Congress that
the administration could not win, the New York Times reported
today.
   On the gulf crisis, Bush reiterated his position that if war
breaks out, ``it is not going to be another Vietnam.''
   ``The agony of Vietnam is still with us. People remember a
protracted war. They remember a war where individuals were asked to
fight with one hand tied behind their back, in essence,'' he said.
``This will not be, in my view, that kind of confrontation.''
   Bush said he still wants a peaceful solution but doubts that
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein believes the United States and its
allies are ready to go to war over Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   The public would not support ``a long, drawn-out conflagration.
I think support would erode as it did in the Vietnam conflict,''
Bush said.
   Asked why none of his Cabinet members had children serving in
Saudi Arabia, he said, ``I just don't know where their kids are.''
   The president called the armed forces ``the finest kids, the
best trained, the best motivated, the high achievers, not the low
achievers. And so this argument that there's some kind of racism
... in this deployment, I reject it out of - the whole cloth.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle, meanwhile, told a Washington foreign
policy conference Tuesday it's far from certain that the talks Bush
offered to hold with Iraq will occur.
   Quayle accused Iraq of an ``attempt to manipulate'' the process
by insisting on meeting dates the United States opposes.
   Quayle, who had considered a Christmastime trip to the gulf to
visit the troops has decided against it for logistical reasons,
among them the uncertainty of the timing of Secretary of State
James A. Baker III's proposed visit to Baghdad to meet Saddam.
Quayle plans to go later time, an official said.
   On another matter at his news conference, Bush denied his
administration had flip-flopped on scholarships reserved for
minorities, but he said such aid ``should be beyond challenge'' if
it is privately financed.
   Still, he predicted a possible court challenge to
minority-targeted scholarships, and said he would be open to
legislation to ``correct it fairly.''
   The policy, announced earlier Tuesday by the Education
Department's civil rights chief, bars federal funding of
minority-only scholarships, but allows aid from other sources to be
earmarked for minorities.
   It was a partial reversal of a more sweeping ban announced last
week that caught top White House officials unaware.

<HEAD>Authorities Probe Fraud Allegations in Sale of Ex-Beatle's Birth
Certificate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State and local officials confirmed they are
investigating whether the $18,000 auction sale of ex-Beatle Paul
McCartney's birth certificate was faked to inflate the document's
value.
   Officials of the state Licensing and Regulation Department and
the Harris County district attorney's office said Tuesday the
allegations made by the auction's promoter, Cheryl Bean, could lead
to charges of deceptive business practices.
   Elvis Schulze, general counsel for the state Licensing and
Regulation Department, said his agency investigates every consumer
complaint.
   The birth certificate - the legitimacy of which has not been
questioned - was put up for sale last month by Marshall Terrell,
who bought it from McCartney's stepmother, Angela Williams,
according to a bill of sale provided by Ms. Bean. McCartney was not
involved in the sale.
   Ms. Bean accused Terrell, buyer Brian Taylor, auctioneer Ray
Simpson and Phoebe Moody, who took the certificate to Simpson on
Terrell's behalf, of faking the sale.
   ``Now when Marshall and them want to sell it, they can say,
`Well, gee, it sold for $18,000 in Houston,' and get a lot more for
it later,'' she said. ``And Ray Simpson got free publicity,
worldwide publicity, and that's worth a lot of money.''
   Simpson said the sale was legitimate.
   ``I'm not aware of any problem,'' he said. ``The sale went fine.
Everything's taken care of. As far as we're concerned, it's a
closed deal.''
   He declined to say if Taylor had paid for the certificate.
   Taylor, 26, a student at Virginia Commonwealth University, was
asked by reporters after the sale where he got the money for the
purchase. He joked that he ``had a paper route as a kid.''
   Attempts to reach Ms. Moody, Taylor and Terrell were
unsuccessful. Ms. Moody did not return phone calls to her office
Tuesday.
   A student affairs officer at Virginia Commonwealth University
said Taylor's phone was disconnected and he had asked that no
forwarding information be released. Terrell, who lives in
Alexandria, Va., has an unlisted phone number.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. human rights envoy said today he appealed
to Chinese officials to release political prisoners, and U.S.
Embassy officials said China's attitude toward human rights was
changing.
   Richard Schifter, assistant secretary of state for human rights
and humanitarian affairs, said the Chinese made no promises but
indicated willingness to continue talking about human rights
issues.
   He submitted a list of 150 prisoners' names for future
discussion, he said.
   ``We had worthwhile exchanges,'' Schifter told a news
conference. ``There was no ... argument.''
   The U.S. Embassy said Schifter's two days of meetings with
officials from the courts, police ministry and other departments
represented a major advance. China traditionally has insisted that
how it treat dissidents is an internal affair.
   Schifter's visit marked the first time China agreed to discuss
human rights issues in such detail with an American official.
   In addition to political prisoners, topics included China's
policy toward religious believers and its policy of discouraging
families from having more than one child.
   ``Attitudinally you've got a sea change,'' said Ambassador James
Lilley. ``Whether this ends up in concrete results remains to be
seen.''
   Schifter said the Chinese told him the cases of students and
intellectuals jailed after last year's pro-democracy movement were
not ready for trial yet.
   The relatives of about a dozen such prisoners have received
formal arrest notices setting forth charges in recent weeks, but
Chinese officials say no trials have started.
   Schifter said he asked that the U.S. Embassy be notified when
the trials start and be allowed to send an observer if proceedings
are open.
   He said the list of 150 prisoners he submitted included people
jailed for their roles in the 1989 democracy movement, which was
crushed on June 3-4, 1989, when the Chinese army opened fire on
protesters in Beijing.
   ``I made the point that ... I hope after they review the names
to engage in case-by-case discussions,'' he said. ``They didn't say
no.''
   Schifter did not release the list, but said it also included
people jailed in past democracy movements, Tibetan independence
activists and people jailed for their religious beliefs.
   He confirmed it included Wei Jingsheng, who is serving a 15-year
jail term for advocating a multiparty system during the 1978-79
Democracy Wall movement.
   Schifter said he made no threats but told the Chinese that the
U.S. Congress may revive legislation to deny China preferential
trade status if it does not improve its human rights record.
   ``I cannot predict what they are going to be doing,'' he said.
``We hope for the best.''
   He said the U.S. Embassy in Beijing plans follow-up discussions.
   Kent Wiedemann, director of the State Department's Office of
Chinese and Mongolian Affairs, said all the Chinese officials
Schifter met ``agreed to continue contact on the issues we
raised.''

   The Oil Ministry today urged Iraqis to
stockpile gas and fuel oil during the winter to avoid shortages if
war breaks out.
   The announcement acknowledged oil refineries would be prime
targets of air attacks if a U.S.-led multinational force in the
Persian Gulf goes to war with Baghdad. The U.N. Security Council
has authorized the use of military force to drive Iraq out of
Kuwait if it does not withdraw voluntarily by Jan. 15.
   The announcement, published by the government's Al-Jumhuriya
daily newspaper, said the ministry will provide fuel oil, kerosene,
cooking gas, gasoline and diesel so that purchases can be made.
``We hope that all citizens will buy their needs so they may
overcome any shortages that might result from an aggression on our
oil installations,'' it said.
   After Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, the U.N. Security
Council imposed a trade embago that halted Iraq's oil exports.
   Since then, Iraq has shut down an estimated 75 percent of its
oil fields, and production has plummeted from 3.1 million barrels
of oil a day to 400,000. Current production is solely for domestic
needs.
   In October, Oil Minister Issam al-Chalabi announced gasoline
rationing, citing the refining problems. But the ruling
Revolutionary Command Council headed by President Saddam Hussein
i Lanka is controlled partially by the Tigers and
government forces.
   Today's attack came a day after a land mine planted by the
guerrillas exploded under an army jeep and killed Brig. Lakshmana
Wijeratne, the commander of security forces in the eastern
Trincomalee district.
   Wijeratne, 46, a police superintendent and six soldiers were
killed in the blast near Panmedawachchiya village in Trincomalee
district, 150 miles northeast of Colombo.
   Wijeratne was the most senior military officer killed so far by
the Tamil Tigers in their 7{-year-old secessionist movement. A
colonel was killed in 1985, also in a mine blast.
   More than 14,000 people have been killed since separatists among
Tamils started the campaign in 1983, claiming the ethnic minority
Tamils were discriminated in jobs and education by the Sinhalese.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
Sinhalese, who account for 75 percent, dominate the government and
the military.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 200 people accused of rioting in
Albania as the nation's pro-democracy movement came to life last
week have been placed on trial for vandalism and other charges, a
report said today.
   The anti-government riots occurred in four Albanian cities,
prompting both the hard-line Communist government and a newly
formed pro-democracy political party to call for an end to the
unrest.
   The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug, citing Albanian radio reports
late Tuesday, said 62 people were being tried in the coastal city
of Durres, 55 in Elbasan, and 60 in Shkodra. The agency was
monitored in Vienna.
   Thousands of angry protesters burned and ransacked stores and
other buildings in Shkodra, Durres, nearby Kavaje and the central
city of Elbasan on Thursday and Friday.
   They demanded political change following last year's revolutions
that toppled one-party Communist governments across eastern Europe.
Those changes left Albania isolated as the last hard-line Communist
holdout on the continent.
   Tanjug said the defendants were accused of ``acts against
property, lives and health, improper conduct, attacks on the organs
of (Communist) authority, illegal rallying'' and other offenses.
   ``Radio Tirana said that the accused admit responsibility,
repent, and claim that they should have acted through dialogue, as
defined by Albanian law,'' the dispatch said.
   ``Radio Tirana claims that lawyers and defendants are present at
the trials and that the defendants are guaranteed the right of
appeal.''
   The Tanjug report gave no other details.
   Albania decreed independent political organizations legal
following the riots, and Gramoz Pashko, a leader of the new
Democratic Party of Albania, the nation's first non-Communist
Party, said Tuesday his group applied for registration.
   Outlining the decree on political parties today, the state ATA
news agency said it ``recognizes the right of the citizens to form
political and social organizations,'' subject to approval by the
Justice Ministry.
   The decree approved by the Presidium of the People's Assembly,
or parliament, prohibits parties with ``fascist, racist,
warmongering, anti-national character or that instigate national
hatred,'' said ATA, monitored in Vienna.
   A political program issued by Pashko's party declared that the
party's goal was creation of a democratic and pluralistic society
with a market economy instead of central planning, according to the
HINA news agency of the Yugoslavian republic of Croatia, reporting
from Tirana.

<HEAD>Disney Agrees To Stop Selling `Steve The Tramp' Dolls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bowing to pressure from advocates for the
homeless, the Walt Disney Co. has decided to stop selling an toy
figure of a tramp.
   The Rev. Christopher Rose, rector of Grace Episcopal Church,
inspired the protests early this month when he cited ``Steve the
Tramp'' as one of the most offensive toys of the 1990 Chrstmas
season.
   ``I'm glad somebody there got a conscience,'' Rose said Tuesday
when he learned of Disney's action. ``But I feel it is a hollow
victory because it is only a week before Christmas.''
   The 5-inch-high plastic figure is one of a series of 14
``coppers and gangsters'' based on the movie ``Dick Tracy,'' which
was produced by Disney-owned Touchstone Pictures.
   The tramp is described on the package as ``hardened and bitter
after a life on the mean streets ... a lout who would just as soon
take your life as your wallet ... (and) will use and abuse any
young, helpless prey he comes across.''
   ``We feel that the action figure, when viewed outside the
fantasy world of `Dick Tracy,' is being misunderstood,'' said a
statement released by the Walt Disney Co. in Burbank, Calif.,
Monday evening.
   Joining in the statement were Playmates Toys Inc. of La Mirada,
Calif., which is licensed by Disney to manufacture and market the
toy, and the National Coalition for the Homeless, based in New York
City.
   ``Playmates has decided to discontinue production and
distribution of the doll. Disney has removed the figure from
shelves at its chain of retail stores and theme parks,'' the
statement said.
   However, Disney spokesman Chuck Champlin acknowledged Tuesday
that it was too late to recall the toy from other retailers a week
before Christmas.
   Some chains discontinued sale of the tramp doll after advocates
for the homeless protested and picketed stores.
   Rose brought the figure to the attention of advocates for the
homeless in his annual ``Warped Toys for Christmas'' display at his
church Dec. 2.
   A nationwide chain of 1,200 stores, Kay Bee Toy and Hobby,
pulled the figure from its shelves Dec. 7 after activists picketed
its stores in the Stamford Town Center.
   Marvin Minkler, an organizer of the Stamford protest, said
Playmates Toys has donated more than 800 toys to his organization,
Gateway Communities Homeless Outreach, to give to poor children.
   A Disney representative also promised to meet with Gateway in
January to see how they might collaborate on a program to help
homeless people, Minkler said.
   ``As you see, in the end we agree the product is indefensible,''
said Champlin, who two weeks ago released a statement defending
sale of the figure.
   Michael Stoops, assistant director of the National Coalition for
the Homeless, said: ``We appreciate the responsiveness of both the
Walt Disney Co. and Playmates Toys in withdrawing the Steve the
Tramp doll from store shelves and ending production and
distribution.''
   Rose said his Steve the Tramp figure is joining other offensive
toys, which he has been collecting for four years, in a church
storeroom.
   Someday, Rose said, he hopes to open a museum of tasteless toys
``as a sad commentary on late 20th-century culture.''

   The Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland
purchased a handwritten copy of the rock anthem ``Purple Haze'' by
Jimi Hendrix for $17,600 at an auction, Sotheby's said.
   The sale of entertainment and rock 'n' roll memorabilia brought
$176,000 for a collection of handwritten lyrics, essays, song notes
and personal belongings of Hendrix, and $24,000 for Elvis Presley's
acoustic guitar.
   Only four out of the 60 Hendrix lots failed to sell at the
Sotheby auction on Monday. The collection was consigned by an
anonymous collector, said Laura Stewart, a Sotheby's spokeswoman.
   The 1966 draft in black ball-point pen on yellow-lined notepaper
is the earliest known to exist of ``Purple Haze,'' which appeared
on Hendrix's debut album ``Are You Experienced'' in 1967. The
lyrics were valued at $8,000 to $12,000.
   An anonymous buyer placed the winning bid for the Presley
guitar. The acoustic guitar finished in black from the 1970s was
sold by an anonymous consignor, Stewart said.
   The total for Monday's sale was $293,269, according to the
auction house.

   Vice President Dan Quayle will visit the U.S.
troops in Saudi Arabia Dec. 29 to Jan. 2, and meet with King Fahd,
he said today.
   Quayle will pay visits to all four branches of the U.S. military
sent by President Bush to withstand Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's military machine, said Quayle's press secretary, David
Beckwith.
   He said the purpose of the trip would be to consult with the
Saudis and build the morale of U.S. troops, who received a
Thanksgiving visit from President Bush.
   Quayle met this morning with Prince Bandar, the Saudi
ambassador, to discuss details of his trip.
   ``I'm looking forward to it,'' Quayle said during a photo
session.
   Bandar, answering a reporter's question, said his country would
find unacceptable any solution to the crisis that allows Iraq to
keep any island off Kuwait, which some have suggested as a possible
way to end the occupation.
   Quayle had considered a Christmas visit to the gulf, but that
was nixed for logistical reasons, aides said. Quayle will be back
home well before the Jan. 15 deadline set by the United Nations for
Iraq to pull its occupying troops out of Kuwait.
   Bandar said the king is looking forward to meeting Quayle and
thanking him for the U.S. military support.

<TEXT>
   Imelda Marcos has indicated she wants
an out-of-court settlement to lawsuits seeking the return of
billions of dollars in allegedly embezzled government funds, an
official said today.
   The government claims Mrs. Marcos, her late husband, former
President Ferdinand Marcos, and their associates stole up to $10
billion until a popular revolt toppled his 20-year rule in 1986.
   David Castro, chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good
Government, said Mrs. Marcos told him she wanted to settle the
suits out of court, despite a breakdown last week in talks to
settle a suit filed against her in Los Angeles.
   Castro said he met with Mrs. Marcos in Los Angeles on Dec. 11
and told her the government was aware of Marcos-held assets in at
least 10 countries that were not included in the suits already
filed against her in the Philippines and the United States.
   Castro said he mentioned one Swiss bank account the government
believes belonged to Marcos that ``could be the biggest thing that
we could get our hands on.'' He refused to give details of the
account.
   He said Mrs. Marcos claimed not to know about the account, and
he said he had reason to believe her. He did not elaborate.
   Castro said the meeting ended ``on a very good note'' and Mrs.
Marcos gave him her private telephone number.
   The meeting was held one day after a court hearing on a motion
to dismiss civil suits against Mrs. Marcos in Los Angeles.
   President Corazon Aquino's government filed the suits claiming
$50 million in Marcos properties and $5 billion in damages.
   On Monday, the government said it was breaking off talks on an
out-of-court settlement of the California lawsuit against Mrs.
Marcos because of bad faith on her part. Castro said that under a
tentative settlement, the government would have received 60 percent
of the assets held by Marcos trustees in five Hong Kong banks.
   Castro said that if the government recovered at least $200
million from the banks, it would drop the California suits.
   But he said the negotiations halted after Mrs. Marcos' lawyers
insisted on seeking the dismissal of the California cases, claiming
they had reached an agreement with the government to drop them.
   Castro said the move was ``a dirty trick.''
   The court has not ruled on the dismissal motion.

<DATELINE>NICHOLASVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dog trained to help police find
drugs attacked a fifth-grade girl during a demonstration in her
classroom, and the youngster required nearly 50 stitches.
   The Labrador retriever, named Bruiser, was taken to school
Tuesday as part of the Police Department's Drug Awareness
Resistance Education program, said Joan Vice, a teacher at Hattie
C. Warner Elementary School.
   The dog's trainer hid a packet of simulated marijuana, used to
train dogs, while 20 children were sitting on the classroom floor,
Vice said. Bruiser found the packet and the trainer threw it so
Bruiser could play with it to reinforce his behavior, Vice said.
   ``At this point he had taken the dog off the leash,'' she said.
``So the dog ran toward the front of the room where the children
were and nudged and messed around with the packet. And then for no
reason, absolutely no provocation, turned on this child.''
   Ten-year-old Geri Cobb was taken to Humana Hospital-Lexington.
She received 35 stitches for severe bites to the back of her head
and 14 stitches to her right hand and arm and was released.
   There was no comment from Bruiser's trainer, policeman Dallas
Murphy; he has an unlisted telephone number and was off duty until
later today, a dispatcher said.
   Bruiser has successfully aided police in drug searches for six
months, said Maj. Robert Sallee, assistant chief of operations.
   The dog ``showed no signs of being aggressive before,'' Sallee
said. ``It's strictly a drug-search dog, passively trained.''
   Sallee said the dog has had rabies shots and other recommended
vaccinations and has been examined by a veterinarian. The dog is
being kept in a kennel under quarantine during the investigation,
Sallee said.
   Richard Williams, the school's principal, said school officials
would review their policy allowing demonstrations involving
animals.
   ``We're going to discuss and see if there is any way that we can
prevent any of this kind of thing from occurring again, of
course,'' Williams said.
   ``If they can't control their dogs they don't need to have them
in the classroom,'' said Geri's mother, Donna Cobb.

<TEXT>
   Pennsylvania's state government is facing
a potential deficit approaching $1 billion that could lead to the
layoff of state workers and cuts in welfare and other programs,
officials said.
   State Budget Secretary Michael Hershock said Tuesday ``every
indication'' showed the state's economy had stopped growing and was
expected to be in a recession through March.
   The disclosure of the looming $959 million deficit marked the
first time the administration has acknowledged the magnitude of the
state's financial problems.
   Only last month Gov. Robert P. Casey's campaign commercials
described the state as ``the rising new star of America'' where the
economy was flourishing.
   Hershock said the state would take a wide array of cost-cutting
steps aimed at balancing the budget by June 30, the end of the
fiscal year. He said it was too soon to say if a tax increase would
be needed.
   Taxes ``will be the last resort,'' Hershock said, echoing
previous statements by Casey.
   Pennsylvania is not the only state facing a budget deficit
because of the rising cost of services, falling tax revenues and
slowing consumer spending. At least 30 states face deficits,
ranging from $42 million in Tennessee to $1 billion in New York,
according to recent studies by the National Association of State
Budget Officers and The Boston Globe.
   Hershock said the state was caught in a bind between a weakening
national economy and an increase in the need for welfare programs.
   Earlier this month, the Public Welfare Department disclosed it
was facing a $440 million cash shortfall.
   Last week, Casey directed state departments to slash maintenance
and other operating expenses by 6 percent and ordered continued
controls on hiring and purchases.
   Hershock said a series of task forces would look at additional
ways to trim spending and raise revenue, such as selling surplus
land and increasing state fees.
   The state will also consider curtailing some programs that are
optional under federal rules, Hershock said. Among them are dental,
podiatric and drug-and-alcohol abuse programs for welfare
recipients.
   Layoffs for state workers are also being reviewed.

<HEAD>Group Claims Responsibility for Attack on Greek EC Offices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The November 17 terrorist group today
claimed responsibility for a weekend missile attack that gutted the
offices of the European Community in Athens and wounded two people.
   In a statement published by the newspaper Eleftherotypia, the
group said it launched two anti-tank missiles at the offices Sunday
to protest Community loan guidelines.
   It also said it would attack Saudi Arabian interests if ARAMCO
went through with a reported offer to buy a 50 percent stake in
Greece's two state-controlled refineries.
   The EC has told Greece's New Democracy government it must take
tougher measures to reduce a 1991 budget deficit of $13.8 billion
in order to receive a $2.78 billion loan.
   The government has taken a series of austerity measures, but has
been criticized for failing to adequately reduce spending.
   ``The EC directorate is today forcing harsh terms and a policy
of tough austerity on the people through their New Democracy
slaves,'' November 17 said in the statement, which the newspaper
said it found in a garbage can after an anonymous phone call.
   November 17 is opposed to Greece's membership in the EC and the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and to the U.S. military
presence in Greece.
   The attack came one day before Parliament approved a new
anti-terrorist law and began debate on the 1991 budget.
   The new law, which will go into effect in about two weeks, will
give police wider powers to investigate suspects and will bar media
from publicizing terrorist statements.
   ``This (new) law was approved...on the orders of the EC,'' the
group said.
   Described by the State Department as one of the most lethal
terror groups in Europe, November 17 has killed 14 people since
1975 without any of its members being arrested. Three of its
victims were U.S. officials serving in Greece.
   Police officials said security forces are on high alert, as
Sunday marks the 15th anniversary of the group's first
assassination, the killing of CIA station chief Richard Welch.

   It took him more than six months to do what he'd
planned would take eight weeks, but a seaplane pilot circled the
globe landing only on water.
   Pilot Tom Casey overcame bureaucratic delays, surgery in Saudi
Arabia and a crash landing in Alaska during his record-setting
trip.
   ``Sorry I'm late, but I'm here,'' Casey told the crowd of
admirers that gathered to watch him land Tuesday on Lake
Washington.
   Casey claimed the title of first person to fly around the globe
landing only on water, when his single-engine Cessna 206 equipped
with pontoons dropped out of a cloudy, sleet-filled sky onto the
lake where he had started his trip six months earlier.
   Casey, 53, said he persevered because of a desire to finish what
he'd started, and ``basically, having to get the airplane back
home. There was no other way to get it back.''
   He took off and landed more than 75 times on oceans, lakes and
rivers in 20 countries during the trip.
   The flight around the world in a seaplane must be recognized by
the Federation Aeronautique Internationale, the official world air
record sanctioning body. His backers said they expected it to be
certified soon.
   The original plan was for Casey to fly westward beginning May
20, arriving back in Seattle in time for the Goodwill Games that
began in late July.
   Last spring he arrived in Anchorage intending to fly west to the
Soviet Union. But after failing to win timely permission to enter
that country he returned to the continental United States, flew to
the East Coast and across the North Atlantic, Europe and Asia.
   In Pakistan and Greece, he encountered delays, and in Saudi
Arabia he was hospitalized for nearly a month for back surgery.
   Casey had said his most difficult bureaucratic snafu, gaining
clearance to enter India from Pakistan, took 21 days to resolve.
   Casey challenged other Americans to go out and test themselves.
``People should go out and try to break records,'' he said.

   The man convicted of killing Chico
Mendes said in a televised interview that his only regret was that
he shot the rain forest ecologist and union leader during an
ambush.
   ``That was kind of cowardly,'' Darci Alves Pereira, 23, told the
SBT network Tuesday night. ``I would kill Chico Mendes again, but
differently ... Now I'd do it face-to-face,'' Pereira said in an
interview from prison.
   Pereira confessed to the shooting during a dramatic four-day
trial that ended Saturday in the remote jungle town of Xapuri,
where Mendes was shot on Dec. 22, 1988. Pereira's father, rancher
Darly Alves da Silva, was convicted of planning the shotgun slaying
of Mendes, an internationally known crusader for the preservation
of the Amazon forest from destruction by ranchers and loggers.
   The two were sentenced to 19 years in prison.
   Pereira also is serving a 12-year prison term for shooting at a
meeting of rubber tappers. He is jailed in in Rio Branco, the
capital of Acre state, 2,600 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
   Da Silva, who pleaded innocent, again denied any involvement in
Mendes' shooting. ``I'm not a killer,'' he told a TV reporter.
``I'm an honest man. I love my neighbor as myself.''
   The trial drew worldwide attention to the plight of tappers and
native Indians who depend on the rapidly vanishing forest for
survival.
   About one-tenth of the 2 million square mile wilderness has been
destroyed, an area the size of Texas.
   Burning releases methane gas and carbon dioxide and is believed
to add to the greenhouse effect that is changing the world's
weather.

   A howling storm dumped up to 14 inches of snow in
western Washington, knocking out power to tens of thousands of
homes and stranding children overnight in more than three dozen
schools.
   The storm forced the cancellation of classes at most Seattle
schools today, and Mayor Norm Rice urged employers to give workers
at least the morning off.
   ``We are anticipating really treacherous conditions, really
slick roads, and we want to do anything we can do to help keep
people off the roads,'' mayoral spokesman Mark Murray said.
   Seattle gets lots of rain but little snow and has practically no
snow removal equipment.
   The storm bombarded the Pacific Northwest, northern Rocky
Mountain states and the Dakotas with icy temperatures today, and
overnight lows dropping well below zero set the stage for daytime
highs expected to peak in the 20s.
   A winter storm warning continued today from southwestern
Washington to Portland, Ore.
   Snowfall ranged from 8 inches downtown to 14 inches in some
suburbs Tuesday evening. Winds gusting to 60 mph on Puget Sound
bedeviled boat owners. Seattle-Tacoma Airport was closed for nearly
two hours for snow removal.
   There were numerous minor accidents, but no deaths or major
injuries were reported. Many roads were closed or impassable
because of snow drifts Tuesday.
   More than 100,000 customers were without power for at least part
of the night, said Puget Sound Power &amp; Light Co., the region's
largest utility. Other utilities in the area also reported
widespread outages.
   Thirty-seven schools in King County remained open all night to
house roughly 2,600 children and faculty who couldn't make it home,
county emergency services officials said.
   In Seattle, children were stranded overnight in more than a
dozen schools but had enough heat, food and supervision, said
School Superintendent William Kendrick.
   ``It's a difficult situation. We're doing the best we can with
it,'' he said. ``It's the first time in 34 years that I've seen
anything like this.''
   Residents of Vashon Island, about 30 miles south of Seattle in
Puget Sound, remained isolated todaythis morning because ferry
service was knocked out. High wind and waves up to 14 feet halted
ferry service late Tuesday, and knocked loose the island's
pedestrianramp to the ferry, said Washington State Ferries
spokeswoman Princess Jackson-Smith.
   The National Weather Service issued high wind warnings for the
western half of the state and a winter storm warning for 3 to 6
inches of snow from the Oregon state line northward remained in
effect today.
   ``Ice, snow, gusty winds and cold temperatures are all coming at
the same time,'' meteorologist Hank Treick said. ``The whole
blooming state is going to get it.''
   Seattle SuperSonics basketball coach K.C. Jones said his usual
30-minute commute to Seattle Center Coliseum took four hours
Tuesday night. He missed the first quarter of a game with the
Orlando Magic but did better than most ticketholders. Team
spokesman Bill Bohlke said of 10,475 tickets sold, only 1,568 were
used.
   Seventy miles north of the city, three people were rescued from
a drifting houseboat and three sea-urchin divers were taken from a
28-foot sailboat late Tuesday as winds topping 60 mph hit the San
Juan Islands.
   Four inches of snow had fallen on Salt Lake International
Airport in Utah by early today, with more snow expected throughout
the day.
   In the Dakotas, the mercury plummeted as much as 30 degrees in
an hour Tuesday, bringing snow and overnight wind-chill readings as
low as 70 below zero. Montana had heavy snow and similar sub-zero
temperatures.
   The storm should persist into the weekend, Weather Service
spokesman Randy Calaway said in Montana.
   ``It's like a monster coming in - we don't know exactly what
it's going to do,'' Calaway said.

   Four architects are asking a federal court to
reject government tampering with their prize-winning design for the
$14.9 million Korean War veterans' memorial in the capital.
   The architects, from Pennsylvania State University, said Tuesday
they entered and won a $20,000 design contest last year believing
the winning entry would be built on the Mall, across the Reflecting
Pool from the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.
   Instead, they alleged in a suit filed today in U.S. District
Court, their design was discarded by the government, a memorial
advisory board and an architectural firm.
   ``From behind closed doors, they surreptitiously developed
another design and they have managed to slip before the public, in
recent days, their own ideas for the memorial - ideas that
glamorize and romanticize the act of war,'' architect Don Leon, one
of the plaintiffs, said at a news conference.
   ``As any Korean War veteran can tell you, that war, no matter
how noble its intent, was never glamorous and romantic,'' Leon
said.
   Named as defendants were the Army Corps of Engineers, the
American Battle Monuments Commission, the Korean War Veterans
Memorial Advisory Board and Cooper-Lecky Architects of Washington.
   The advisory board was created by Congress to select the site
and the design, subject to the commission's approval. Then,
Cooper-Lecky was retained by the corps last May to finalize the
plan and build the memorial.
   The suit seeks an order blocking the defendants ``from
proceeding with the new, substituted Cooper-Lecky Architects
design.''
   It also requests more than $250,000 in damages from both the
advisory board and Cooper-Lecky. It alleges that Cooper-Lecky
failed to consult with the original architects on the changes, as
required by contract, and that the advisory board instructed
Cooper-Lecky ``on certain design additions and deletions.''
   Retired Army Gen. Richard Stilwell, chairman of the advisory
board, said the suit ``has absolutely no foundation and, in my
humble view, is aimed at frustrating the will of Congress that a
national memorial to the veterans of the Korean war be established
within the time frame dictated by public law.''
   W. Kent Cooper of Cooper-Lecky said Tuesday he had not yet seen
the suit, and could not comment.
   The Penn State design called for ``a dream-like'' collection of
38 soldiers moving, some unevenly, across a remote landscape toward
an American flag.
   The revised design would confront visitors ``with the reality of
actual war,'' sculptor Frank Gaylord, who is working with
Cooper-Lecky on the project, said last week. Some soldiers ``are
responding to unexpected, unfriendly fire,'' he said.
   The new plan adds a grove of trees called a ``chapel'' and a
mural on the history of the war.
   Stilwell said in October that the original architects
``relinquished all rights to their submission in consideration of
substantial prize money.'' He said the new design retains the
essential element of the old one - a column of troops advancing
toward a flag.
   Some 5.7 million Americans served in Korea during the 1950-53
conflict; more than 54,000 were killed.
   The original memorial design was unveiled at a Flag Day ceremony
at the White House on June 14, 1989.

accusing Iraqi occupation forces in Kuwait of torturing and killing
hundreds of people, including 300 premature babies who died because
incubators were stolen.
   The Iraqi Embassy in London today said the report by the
international human rights group includes ``stories that are
absolutely false.''
   Amnesty International's first comprehensive description of
abuses in occupied Kuwait since the Iraqi invasion on Aug. 2 gives
few precise figures.
   But Norma Johnson, the human rights organization's head of
communications, said today that ``About 1,000 people have been
executed, many hundreds have been tortured and something like
10,000 still remain in detention in Kuwait.
   ``People going out of their homes to buy food, innocent
Kuwaitis, are being picked up by the Iraqi troops, taken back to
their homes, and when they are identified by their parents, for
example, are simply being shot in front of them,'' she said in a
radio interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.
   President Bush, who has cited Iraqi brutality as a reason for
wanting to liberate Kuwait, said Tuesday that the 82-page Amnesty
report provides examples of Iraq's ``primeval'' treatment of the
vanquished Kuwaitis.
   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly Churkin told
a news briefing today: ``It is with anxiety and pain we have
learned of the report ... Iraq must leave Kuwait unconditionally.''
   The Iraqi Embassy n London said in a statement that the
report's allegations were baseless and ``stand in stark contrast to
its (Amnesty International's) inaction at a time when hundreds of
Iraqi babies are dying owing to acute shortages of baby milk and
medicine.'' Iraq contends a U.N. embargo on trade with Iraq has led
to a shortage of medicine and baby formula.
   Some international observers say they fear that reports on Iraqi
atrocities might fan the flames of war. The hundreds of deaths that
London-based Amnesty and other independent human rights groups are
reporting are far less than the thousands alleged by exiled Kuwaiti
officials.
   Amnesty notes in the report that Iraqi authorities have engaged
in similar practices against their own people for years.
   The report cites ``widespread abuses of human rights'' in
Kuwait.
   ``These include the arbitrary arrest and detention without trial
of thousands of civilians and (Kuwaiti) military personnel; the
widespread torture of such persons in custody; the imposition of
the death penalty and the extrajudicial execution of hundreds of
unarmed civilians, including children,'' the report says.
   ``In addition, hundreds of people in Kuwait remain unaccounted
for, having effectively `disappeared' in detention, and many of
them are feared dead,'' it says.
   The Iraqis left more than 300 premature babies to die after
stealing their incubators from Kuwait City hospitals, the report
says. Amnesty says its investigators interviewed several doctors
and nurses and that all saw bodies of the babies. One doctor helped
bury 72 bodies, it says.
   Amnesty said its investigators spoke to victims of torture,
doctors who treated them, their relatives and witnesses.
   The report lists 38 methods of torture employed by Iraqi forces,
including beatings while the victim was suspended from a rotating
ceiling fan; rape of women and young men; stubbing out lighted
cigarettes on victims' eyeballs and tethering victims in the
burning sun for hours without water.
   The report said in some cases the arms, legs and ribs of some
victims were broken, tongues and ears were cut off and eyes were
gouged out. In other cases, victims were castrated, the report
said.
   Amnesty adds, however: ``The Iraqi forces' brutality in Kuwait
has shocked many people in the past four months but such abuses
have been the norm for people in Iraq for more than a decade.''
   A woman at the Iraqi Embassy in London said the ambassador was
the only person authorized to comment on the Amnesty report and
that he was not available.
   Bush, in comments Sunday to interviewer David Frost on a PBS-TV
program scheduled to be aired Jan. 2, said he read it and ``handed
it to Barbara as we left Camp David. And she read about two pages
of it and said, `I can't read anymore.'''
   ``It is primeval,'' he said.
   The report says some people were slain because they carried
Kuwaiti money or refused to pledge allegiance to Saddam. Others
were killed for refusing to help Iraqi soldiers steal medical
equipment or while trying to flee the country.
   Some Kuwaiti supporters estimate 7,000 people have been killed
by the Iraqis and 25,000 have been arrested.
   Various human rights groups have given estimates on the number
of people killed or arrested in Kuwait, but they say the numbers
cannot be verified without direct access to the country.

<HEAD>Defense Plan Envisions Slower Growth in Military Spending</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Japan's Cabinet will slow the growth of military
spending under a new five-year defense plan, Defense Agency
officials said today.
   Analysts say the new plan, which is to be approved Thursday,
follows Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's support of easing military
spending in keeping with the collapse of Communism in Europe.
   Defense Agency officials and senior lawmakers of Kaifu's
governing Liberal Democratic Party have opposed a sharp cut,
contending the reduction in tensions has not yet extended to the
Far East.
   Analysts say the new plan is only a provisional measure. Critics
maintain that it does not go far enough in reducing Japan's defense
spending.
   During the current $138 billion five-year plan, which ends in
March, spending increases averaged 5.4 percent a year.
   The new plan envisions spending of $170.68 billion for
1991-1995, with an average annual increase of less than 3 percent,
agency officials said today, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Defense Agency insists it needs at least $175.86 billion to
meet 1976 guidelines stating that the Self-Defense Forces, Japan's
military, should be capable of repulsing a ``limited, small-scale''
foreign attack.
   But Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto insists the average
annual growth of the defense budget should not exceed 3 percent, an
agency official said.
   Japan also depends on a defense treaty with the United States,
which in the past pressed this nation for bigger defense buildups.
It now is seeking more Japanese funds to support the 50,000 U.S.
troops based in Japan.
   A policy paper released by the National Security Council on
Tuesday said, ``The world situation is heading in desirable
directions...and the possibility of a large-scale military conflict
is lessening.''
   Last week, Kaifu said in Parliament that he planned to restore
Japan's self-imposed defense spending ceiling of 1 percent of its
gross national product.
   The 1 percent ceiling, imposed in 1976, was eliminated in 1987
by the administration of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who
actively promoted the strengthening and modernization of the
Self-Defense Forces.
   The new plan has generated domestic criticism for not cutting
defense spending more.
   ``The rest of the world, including the United States, is
revising its security policies to respond to the new world order,''
said Kazuhisa Ogawa, a political analyst.
   ``But unfortunately, Japan is still sticking with the
conventional stance of only seeing the Soviet Union as a potential
enemy and following what the United States wants Japan to do,'' he
said

   Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a veteran of
the country's turbulent politics, resigned today to make way for a
broad-based reconciliation Cabinet that would boost efforts to end
15 years of civil war.
   Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, submitted the resignation of his 14-man
government to President Elias Hrawi after a four-hour Cabinet
meeting, a presidential statement said.
   Hoss, who turns 61 on Thursday, had formed the government on
Nov. 25, 1989.
   The statement said Hrawi, a Maronite Catholic, asked Hoss to
remain in office as a caretaker prime minister pending
consultations with members of Parliament to name a successor.
   ``Hoss' Cabinet has performed some of the most striking
achievements since the civil war broke out,'' a commentator on the
Molsem-run Voice of the Nation said. ``Conditions now require a new
Cabinet with a wider representation to reconcile the nation's major
antagonists.''
   Hoss, a U.S.-educated former banker, had said that he would not
accept a new term. The edia have speculated that his education
minister, Omar Karami, also a Sunni, is the front-runner for the
post of prime minister.
   Karami, 55, a lawyer, inherited leadership of the second largest
city of Tripoli from his elder brother, the late Prime Minister
Rashid Karami.
   Rashid Karami, the longest serving prime minister since Lebanon
gained independence from France in 1943, was killed in a bomb
explosion aboard an army helicopter on June 1, 1987.
   Hoss served as acting prime minister after Karami's
assassination until his appointment by Hrawi. That was the fourth
time since 1976 that he had served as head of the government.
   Under Hoss, the Lebanese government crushed an 11-month mutiny
by rebel Gen. Michel Aoun on Oct. 13. After that, it moved to
enforce an Arab League-brokered peace pact designed to end the
Christian-Moslem feud.
   On Dec. 3, the Lebanese army deployed across the divided
capital, Beirut, to reunite the city and end militia control in a
first step toward a final settlement of the civil war.
   The peace plan, which has been endorsed by parliament, is widely
regarded as a first step toward eventually ending the sectarian
system of government which had been dominated by Maronites.
   The plan provided for a transitional stage during which the
president loses some of his authority in favor of his Moslem
premier to ensure a balanced distribution of power between
Christians and Moslems.
   Under an unwritten national agreement that has been in force
since independence, a Lebanese president must be a Maronite, the
prime minister a Sunni, and the parliament speaker a Shiite Moslem.
   The new Cabinet is supposed to group key figures from the main
rival militia groups and political parties and work toward
disbanding the private armies that had slowly eroded government
authority since the outbreak of the civil war in April 1975.
   It also was expected to map out a plan for reconstructing
war-ravaged Beirut and shoring up the economy.
   The civil war has claimed more than 150,000 lives and caused up
to $18 billion of destruction, according to the latest United
Nations estimates.
   Under the Arab League peace plan, an international fund would be
set up early next year with a minimum of $2 billion for the
reconstruction of Lebanon.

<HEAD>Kuwaits Paid Public Relations Firm Nearly $5.7 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kuwaitis paid a public relations firm
nearly $5.7 million in less than three months to promote their
country's cause following the Iraqi invasion Aug. 2, Justice
Department records show.
   Citizens for a Free Kuwait, a group that receives money from the
Kuwaiti government-in-exile, gave Hill &amp; Knowlton, the New
York-based international firm, $5.64 million for a period starting
Aug. 20 and ending Nov. 10.
   The records were filed at the Justice Department as required by
the Foreign Agents Registration Act. People representing foreign
governments must file the forms every six months.
   he $5.6 million Hill &amp; Knowlton received from Kuwait was by far
the largest amount the company was paid by any foreign entity for
the six-month period. The next largest amount was $1.89 million
paid by Mazda Motor Corp. of Japan.
   Hill &amp; Knowlton disbursed $2.7 million of the $5.7 million,
including $644,571 on video production and $140,412 on travel.
   The public relations firm's main aim was to ``provide counsel on
a national media program, strategic planning and message
development,'' the filing said.
   Hill &amp; Knowlton coordinated interviews and helped arrange
national programs and events including National Free Kuwait Day,
National Prayer Day and the visit of various Kuwaitis to the United
States.
   The Kuwaiti government-in-exile, which is based in Taif, Saudi
Arabia, has tried to disseminate information about conditions
inside Kuwait, including atrocities reportedly committed by Iraqi
occupation troops.
   Frank Mankiewicz, a senior Hill &amp; Knowlton executive, said the
Kuwait account was worth a lot of money. ``We think it is a worthy
cause,'' he said.
   But Rep. James A. Hayes, D-La., said he was distressed by the
money paid by a foreign entity to a public relations firm.
   ``It's not the amount of time or work, it's the purpose to which
the money is being put to,'' he said.
   Hayes said it was wrong for a public relations firm to serve as
the middle man in a foreign policy debate.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Charges Against Man in Assault of Woman with 46
Personalities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSHKOSH, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge today dismissed charges against a
man accused of sexually assaulting a woman with 46 personalities
after a prosecutor said a retrial would harm her.
   Winnebago County District Attorney Joe Paulus said he decided
against prosecuting 29-year-old Mark A. Peterson again after
doctors for the 27-year-old victim said the ordeal of another trial
likely would cause her mental condition to worsen.
   A jury convicted Peterson Nov. 8 of second-degree sexual assault
but the judge threw out the verdict Monday and ordered another
trial. The judge decided that Peterson received an unfair trial
because his psychiatrist was not allowed to examine the woman,
whose name has not been used to protect her identity.
   ``It is clear that a new trial would not be in the best
interests of the victim and in fact may cause her additional
harm,'' Paulus wrote in a letter to Winnebago County Circuit Judge
Robert Hawley.
   Hawley signed an order this morning dismissing the charge of
second-degree sexual assault against Peterson, said Winnebago
County Deputy District Attorney Vince Biskupic.
   It is a crime in Wisconsin for someone to have sex with a
mentally ill person who cannot understand the consequences of their
actions. The perpetrator must also know the person is mentally ill.
   The jury ruled Peterson, a married ex-grocery store bagger,
manipulated one of the woman's personalities to have sex with her
in the front seat of his car two days after they met.
   Paulus said the woman was willing to go through another trial.
But he told the judge in a letter that he consulted with three
medical experts on multiple personality disorder and they advised
against another trial.
   ``One of the primary goals of the prosecution of Mark Peterson
was to protect the rights of a mentally ill woman and hold her
attacker accountable under the law,'' Paulus said.
   ``The jury verdict, although now set aside on a legal
technicality, sent a strong message to the community that mentally
ill individuals in our society must be protected from those who
prey upon them.''
   Since the case became public, the victim's personalities have
grown from 18 to 21 to 46. Police were called to her home after she
reported one personality was trying to kill her. She has been under
constant psychiatric care and has been hospitalized.

   The government and the army today
said Slovenia will be taking a great risk if voters in Yugoslavia's
most prosperous republic choose this weekend to declare
independence from the country.
   The deputy defense minister, Admiral Stene Brovet, told the
federal Parliament that the army was ready to ``act in accordance
with the Yugoslav Constitution'' and those in Slovenia who ``think
differently, are wrong.''
   The government on Tuesday rejected the Slovenian referendum and
said it would take unspecified steps to preserve the country's
unity. There were fears of army intervention, but Slovenian
officials said the federal government has assured them that the
military would not stop the vote Sunday.
   The leading Slovenian daily Delo today challenged the federal
authorities.
   ``Do (officials) in Belgrade think they can halt Slovenia's
independence, or do they simply want to accelerate our departure
from Yugoslavia?'' it asked in a commentary.
   With Sunday's referendum approaching, ``the old federation is
counting its last hours,'' the paper said. The federation of six
republics and two provinces has been in existence since 1945.
   Justice Minister Vlado Kambovski today told Parliament the
central government was ``warning state organs of Slovenia about the
great responsibility and the risk they are assuming'' if they
unilaterally step out of the federation.
   The government will ``undertake energetic steps to protect
reforms and objective, common interests of all peoples and
nationalities'' in Yugoslavia, Kambovski said without elaboration.
   His comments were reported by the state news agency Tanjug.
   The Parliament ended its session with the demand that Slovenia
reconsider holding the referendum ``because of its consequences.''
   Prosperous Slovenia, governed by a center-right coalition since
spring, wants more independence from central authorities. Slovenia
is backed by Croatia, where Communists were also ousted by
center-right parties in spring elections. They want Yugoslavia
transformed into a loose confederation.
   Serbia, the largest Yugoslav republic, where Communists scored a
victory in recent elections, wants Yugoslavia to remain a
federation with a strong, centralized government.
   The differences have led to a deepening rift among the republics
and strained their relations with the federation, pushing the
Balkan nation to the edge of disintegration.

   A bomb exploded at a Communist Party building in
the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh area in the southern Caucasus region,
Tass said today. No injuries were reported.
   The official Soviet news agency said the blast on Tuesday did
considerable damage to a Communist Party building in Stepanakert,
the biggest city in Nagorno-Karabakh, a mainly Armenian enclave
inside the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan.
   Authorities also discovered a second, unexploded bomb, the news
agency said, without elaborating.
   In the past two years, more than 200 people have died in ethnic
clashes over the control of Nagorno-Karabakh, which Azerbaijan has
held since 1923.
   Tass said six people have been killed in the last week in ethnic
clashes in Nagorno-Karabakh and other parts of the Caucasus region,
where tension between Armenians and Azerbaijanis runs high.
   In January, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev declared a limited
form of martial law in Nagorno-Karabakh. The Soviet leader told
lawmakers today he will not hesitate to impose emergency rule in
any republic where ethnic and political conflicts threaten lives.
   Elsewhere today, the Latvian parliament denounced three predawn
explosions Tuesday in the capital, Riga. No injuries were reported
and most of the damage was restricted to broken windows. No
suspects or motives were identified.
   The Latvian Communist Party said some unidentified people were
trying to blame it for the explosions. It said it had no role in
the blasts.

   A couple has been charged with
negligent homicide after their toddler drank his drug-addicted
father's methadone and died, police said Wednesday.
   The toddler opened the refrigerator in his home Sunday and drank
a bottle half filled with a methadone-laced orange drink that his
31-year-old father had gotten from a municipal heroin withdrawal
program, said police spokesman Dick Graveland.
   Graveland said the liquid contained ``several drops of
methadone. That's an adult dosage.''
   The child's parents did not seek medical help because they
thought their son would recover after a night's sleep. The boy was
found dead in bed Monday morning, Graveland said.
   The spokesman did not identify the victim or his family in
accordance with Dutch police practice.
   Most Dutch cities have methadone programs that dispense the
synthetic narcotic.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the
United States and abroad.

   Dec. 16
   The Sun Herald, Gulfport, Miss., on Congress:
   Businesses and industries are tightening their belts, cutting
back on expansion plans, freezing salaries and payrolls, reducing
expenses, and in some cases laying off workers. The people in
Congress, in contrast, aren't troubling themselves with such
recession-fighting steps.
   Why should congressmen and women worry? The business of
government is booming. Senators, fresh from getting a raise to
$98,400 last February, look forward to January when they will get
the next pay raise they gave themselves, this one to $101,900.
Representatives did themselves even better, jumping their paychecks
from $96,600 to $125,100. ...
   Lest you should think that those increases aren't enough
compensation for the wonderful job the Congress is doing, remember
that senators will be allowed to keep up to $23,837 in honoraria,
the fees for giving speeches, writing articles and similar
moonlighting. House members will stop keeping honoraria.
   One other note about the pay increases. Congressfolk achieved
them without accountability. It was done by voice vote. No names
recorded, no fingerprints or footprints. No individual
accountability, no need to defend a yea vote since the individuals'
voices were lost in the chorus. ...
   Next year, Congress will cost about $2.2 billion. The cost has
gone up by almost $2 billion in the last 20 years. The climb upward
has been as steadily and as surely as the rise in the national
debt.

   Dec. 14
   Toledo (Ohio) Blade on limiting Congressional terms:
   The throw-the-rascals-out brigade received a boost when
President Bush added his voice to those calling for term limits for
members of Congress. ...
   Bush is climbing upon a bandwagon that is not yet rolling.
Voters in November indicated that they do not yet have a specific
idea of how term limits will be achieved or what duration terms
should be, although 12 years is most often suggested. Rather there
is a distinct hankering for change, for somebody to ``do
something'' to improve the way our system of government is, or is
not, working.
   We understand that sentiment, of course. The notion of the
citizen/legislator as a public-spirited individual who serves his
or her state or district for a limited period and then returns to
private life is appealing. It points to politics as a calling, a
responsibility to be shouldered, not as a sinecure with a good
pension. ...
   Quality leadership, conscientious lawmakers, representatives
expert in their field and diligent in performing their duties would
be thrown out arbitrarily with the rascals. ...
   Even so, term limits reflect the groundswell of obvious public
distaste for the game of politics; it should not be ignored.
   ---
   Dec. 18
   Chicago Tribune on NASA:
   Even before the shuttle Challenger blew apart shortly after
launch in 1986, there were signs that the nation's space program
was drifting off course.
   Critics hoped the Challenger accident would spark thorough
self-examination and new direction at the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration. But recent troubles - flaws in the Hubble
Space Telescope, fuel leaks in the aging shuttle fleet and
controversy over a planned space station - suggest the program
still lacks a sound flight plan.
   A panel of experts has offered the White House a strong,
sensible proposal to get America's space exploration back on the
right path. ...
   In addition to being drafted with singular political sensitivity
and shrewdness, the proposals together set clear, logical
objectives for a new space era - one defined primarily by federal
budget deficits and the end of the Cold War. The first will mean
maximizing the available resources to achieve agreed-upon goals;
the second should lead to greater international cooperation and a
reduced military role in space.
   The 12-member committee ... called for sweeping overhaul of the
space program. Specifically, it proposed that the space shuttle be
largely replaced by a new family of powerful, unmanned rockets. It
called for a major redesign and simplification of the space station
aimed at lowering its $37 billion price tag.
   And, instead of concentrating on engineering feats and highly
visible missions with limited practical value, the panel would make
scientific research on the Earth and its environment the top
priority. ...
   This is the correct approach in the post-Cold War, tight-budget

   Daily Times, Primos, Pa., on NASA:
   The space shuttle's future is up in the air, if we're
interpreting signals from the government correctly.
   The same nation that put a man on the moon is now trying to put
the beleagured space shuttle in the garage. A 12-member space
panel, which was formed after NASA's embarrassments began piling
up, has recommended ... that space shuttle flights be confined only
to those that require human involvement.
   Let's face it, the space shuttle program has had its share of
troubles this year.
   The panel also suggested that NASA go back to the drawing board
and redesign its proposed space station and rethink its priorities.
   One thing for certain is that whatever lies in NASA's future, it
can't be much if NASA's space exploration program, in this case,
the shuttle, is relegated to just a few flights, all of which would
be one giant step backward for mankind.
   Space travel is and will never be free of risks. We have known
and understood that for years.

   The Waco (Texas) Tribune-Herald on young smokers:
   The tobacco industry has launched a program to discourage
children from taking up cigarette smoking. The industry campaign
supports state laws limiting cigarette sales to adults and puts new
limitations on billboard advertising near schools.
   The tobacco industry campaign is, as far as it goes, a worthy
effort to prevent American youths from picking up a hazardous habit
that can lead to death. ...
   Congress and state legislatures should not let the tobacco
industry campaign sway them from passage of legislation that would
further protect the health and lives of millions of Americans
hooked on smoking.
   Smoking is a serious health hazard and governmental bodies have
the responsibility to take all reasonable steps to protect citizens
from health hazards.

   Los Angeles Daily News on the education secretary nominee:
   Lamar Alexander, President Bush's choice to be the new education
secretary, is an outspoken education activist who gets results. And
that's exactly the kind of person the job requires.
   As governor of Tennessee from 1978 to 1986, Alexander was a
leader - by no means a mere bandwagon-hopper - in the growing
educational reform movement. He came up with a package of
significant improvements in Tennessee's schools, including
statewide merit pay for teachers, before most other elected
officials seemed ready even to acknowledge that the nation's
schools had severe problems. ... In contrast to Lauro F. Cavazos,
who resigned from the position ... , Alexander is a self-starter
who probably won't have to wait for cues from the White House to
set an agenda for educational reform.
   Alexander compares favorably to Cavazos in another way as well:
The former governor was effective in using his office to take on
the teachers unions, fellow Republicans and others who didn't share
his commitment to educational reform. ...
   Alexander will need to use these same political skills if he is
to succeed in his new job. The same establishment that fought his
reforms in Tennessee will be ready to jump down his throat in
Washington at the mere mention of such reform concepts as
educational choice and a uniform national test for students.

   Roswell (N.M.) Daily Record on Germany:
   A year ago, when the Berlin Wall had just been breached and
Germany's future was uncertain, a great deal of concern was
expressed around the globe about the prospects of a united, more
powerful Germany. The parliamentary elections held recently to
choose a new all-German government should allay most of those
fears.
   In the first free balloting throughout Germany since November
1932, the voters reaffirmed the sensible political middle.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union was given a
solid mandate to build on the policies that led to swift
reunification.
   Significantly, the voters in the east endorsed Kohl's vision in
about the same ratio as the electorate in the west. And Kohl's
vision is one of a united Germany firmly moored to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Community.
   Barely a year after the Berlin Wall was toppled, Germans have
voted for a united nation tied economically and militarily to the
Western democracies. The once-widespread fears that German unity
would wrack the Continent with renewed conflict suddenly seem
overblown.

   Arizona Daily Star, Tucson, Ariz., on the Persian Gulf:
   Good, red American blood is a renewable resource. Good, rich
crude oil is not.
   Because one represents life and the other represents the fuel
that powers what has become the American way of life, you'd think
both would be equally precious.
   They are not.
   The president who is willing to draw lines in the sand with
American blood for the sake of Saudi oil is unwilling to even
discuss cutting down on domestic oil consumption.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins understands that a national
energy policy without an energy-conservation component is as
useless as a Ford without fuel.
   That's why Watkins built energy conservation into the proposal
he's been working on for 18 months. It's also why the White House
dinosaurs (Chief of Staff John Sununu, chief economic adviser
Michael J. Boskin and Budget Director Richard Darman) told Watkins
to drop conservation proposals from the National Energy Strategy.
   The White House dinosaurs don't want an energy policy to go
anywhere. As minions of oil man George Bush, their goal is to
preserve the status quo until every bit of money can be made out of
every bit of oil on the face of the earth.
   And if that takes every drop of good, red American blood, so be
it.
   The laissez faire attitude to energy conservation by the
Reagan-Bush administration assured that the United States would
remain dependent on oil and heavily dependent on foreign oil.

   The Bulletin, Bend, Ore., on the Persian Gulf:
   Former hostages who returned in the past few days from Iraq and
Kuwait were almost universal in their praise of the way the Bush
administration has handled the Gulf crisis.
   Bush's quickness to act, his call-up of military strength, his
clear warnings to Saddam Hussein and his successful grouping of an
overpowering opposition all taken together made Hussein realize he
was on shaky ground.
   Releasing the hostages was his way of meeting at least one of
the requirements Bush laid down.
   Times were not easy for the hostages. Many of them spent four
months in hiding. Many survived through the heroism of Kuwaiti
friends who hid and fed them.
   But they might well have been there for years, rather than
months, had Bush not acted as strongly and decisively as he did.
Almost universally the released hostages appear to realize that.

   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on the Persian Gulf:
   Amid the happiness at the freeing of Iraq's hostages, we want to
take special note of Nathaniel Howell, the U.S. ambassador to
Kuwait, and his embassy staff. During four months of hostile
occupation, surrounded and isolated by unpredictable Iraqi troops,
Ambassador Howell retained his calm and kept the embassy
functioning.
   With war scares running high, he and his skeleton staff of four
other Foreign Service officers managed to make do for most of their
enforced isolation on embassy stocks of canned tuna, augmented by
water from a swimming pool. By firmly resisting the Iraqi demands
that he depart, Ambassador Howell helped to legitimize Kuwait's
status as an independent state. He and his staff handled a tough
situation with real distinction.

   Sun-Sentinel, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on sanctions:
   South Africa and Iraq are as dissimilar as gold and oil, yet the
apparent importance of economic sanctions in bringing about
substantive change in one country may have timely relevance to the
other.
   Much of the world, but principally the United States and the
European Community, imposed a variety of sanctions on South Africa
during the 1980s as punishment for that nation's adherence to a
system of legal segregation known as apartheid.
   Now the international community is virtually united in an
economic embargo and military blockade intended to compel Iraq to
withdraw from occupied Kuwait.
   While politicians debate the impact of the Iraqi sanctions and
ponder the wisdom of going to war to enforce the global will, they
could well draw an important lesson from recent developments in
South Africa.

   The Sunday Telegraph, London, on the Persian Gulf:
   Any visible failure of American nerve in the (Persian) Gulf
would mean the end of the present system of world security. What
could take its place?
   Instead of grappling with this urgent question, Europe's leaders
prefer to waste their time talking about European political union,
which is not only a profoundly divisive aspiration but also one
that could not possibly be realized for many years to come. ...
   For once the United Nations should be the focus of attention.
Every ounce of European diplomacy should be concentrated on
steeling American resolve to carry out the U.N. mandate in the
Gulf.
   World security, not European union, is the question of the hour.
It is sad that there is now no longer a single European statesman
with the courage to say so.

   The Sydney (Australia) Morning Herald on South Africa:
   Is the African National Congress in danger of losing its grip on
the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa? ...
   That cleavages within the ANC should be opening up now is not
all that surprising.
   There is a generational gap between the current top leadership
and most of its members. There is a jostling for position and
power. ...
   There are inevitable differences of opinion over tactics, over
how much trust to place in President de Klerk and over how much
should be compromised in the interests of a lasting peace. ...
   What is surprising is the time it has taken the ANC to begin
getting its house in order. The delay has been costly. It has
allowed indiscipline to grow in the ranks of the ANC and that in
turn to feed the black-on-black violence in Natal province.
   It has increased the chances of impatience for reform, cutting
ANC leaders off from younger, more militant members of the
organization. It has played into the hands of whites inside and
outside ... de Klerk's government who seek to portray the ANC as
incompetent and dangerous for South Africa.
   It is a luxury of time the ANC can no longer afford.

   The Daily Press, Ashland, Wis., on tariff talks:
   Although there are several reasons why the depression of the
1930s happened, it is generally agreed that restrictive tariff wars
contributed greatly.
   Today the United States is participating in the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations in Brussels. There has
been a call among many politicians for the U.S. to pull out of the
negotiations, that we are not receiving the kinds of assurances we
need.
   Granted, the doors are open wider for foreign products entering
this country than they are for most. We do pay a price when it
comes to marketing our products worldwide. But there are stronger
reasons for us to remain a working partner in the tariff and trade
agreements.
   First, levying tariffs on imported products quite simply fuels
inflation. Many of the products in question will still be sold here
to a willing public. We will simply have to pay more.
   But most important the U.S. should not be party to a spiraling
tariff war that eventually catches up with everybody. Prior to the
depression, the trading powers closed their doors to smaller
nations thinking that we were immune to recessionary influences. We
were wrong.
   Promoting a world economy not only establishes a system
versatile enough to withstand devastating depressions, but also
creates economic growth worldwide. Why is that important to us? The
world can't buy what we sell unless they have the money first.

   Ever had a child out of wedlock, written a
letter to a newspaper editor or know someone who will say mean
things about you?
   These are some of the things Gov.-elect John Engler wants to
know before he'll make appointments to a high-level post in his
administration.
   The confidential appointments questionnaire obtained by the
Detroit Free Press is 24 pages long, and it goes beyond the usual
questions about criminal history, drug involvement and health.
   Some of the more unusual inquiries include:
   - Do you know any person or group who might take overt or covert
steps to attack, even unfairly, your appointment?
   - Are you a parent of a child or children born out of wedlock?
   - Have you ever been publicly identified, in person or by
organizational membership, with a particularly controversial
national or local issue?
   - Have you ever submitted oral or written views to any
governmental authority, whether executive or legislative, or to the
news media on any particularly controversial issue other than in an
official governmental capacity?
   William Whitbeck, a lawyer working for the Engler transition
team, said the administration wants to know ahead of time what
trouble to expect.
   ``Unfortunately, too often in politics, people get selected and
things come out that hadn't been disclosed ... and it's a bad
situation for everyone,'' Whitbeck said.
   The questionnaire comes with an apologetic letter, blaming all
the personal intrusion on lawyers, said one applicant, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Whitbeck said the responses will remain confidential and are not
subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Access
to them is limited to only a few staffers, he said.
   Engler, a Republican and state Senate majority leader, beat
two-term Democratic Gov. James Blanchard in the Nov. 6 election.

   Mikhail Gorbachev could be more popular than
Santa Claus this Christmas among the troops guarding Norway's
arctic frontier with the Soviet Union.
   The end of the Cold War has made it possible for Norwegian
soldiers to go home for the holidays in record numbers, said
defense officials.
   Since the 1950s, half the roughly 10,000 soldiers stationed in
this NATO country's frozen north had to stay near their posts
during Christmas in case of a Soviet invasion, said Col. Per
Boethun of the Norwegian Supreme Defense Command.
   But only a thousand, or 10 percent, are on duty this year,
because of eased east-west tensions, due at least in part to
Gorbachev's reforms.
   ``For the few soldiers left at the base, a visit from Santa is
much more likely than an unexpected visit from Gorbachev's Red
Army,'' wrote the Verdens Gang newspaper Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. envoy said Wednesday that he has opened an
unprecedented dialogue with China on human rights issues that he
hopes can lead to the release of political prisoners.
   Richard Schifter, assistant secretary of state for human rights
and humanitarian affairs, said he submitted a list of 150 jailed
democracy activists, Tibetans and religious figures and asked for a
future case-by-case review based on international human rights
standards.
   ``They didn't say no,'' Schifter told a news conference at the
U.S. Embassy.
   He said he told the Chinese that ``persons who have not been
guilty of any act of violence ... should be released.''
   The Chinese made no promises but indicated willingness to
continue talking, he said.
   The visit represents a remarkable break with China's
longstanding poicy of rejecting foreign comment on its treatment
of prisoners of conscience.
   It comes during a warming in U.S-Chinese relations, badly
strained by China's June 1989 army attack on student-led
pro-democracy protesters.
   The Bush administration has been courting China lately in an
effort to win support for U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf, or at
least obtain Beijing's pledge not to oppose it.
   Schifter arrived Monday and held two days of talks withs
officials from China's Foreign Ministry, Justice Ministry, Public
Security Ministry and Supreme People's Court and people responsible
for minority affairs, religious affairs and family planning.
   Topics of the talks included impending trials for leaders of
last year's massive democracy movement, China's religious policy
and its sometimes coercive tactics to prevent families from having
more than one child, he said.
   Schifter is to travel to Shanghai on Thursday for a day of
similar meetings with officials there.
   ``They really engaged in a useful dialogue,'' Schifter said of
Chinese officials.
   He refused to provide details, but said: ``It wasn't a matter of
my simply sitting there and they would hear me out and then the
meeting was over.
   ``I presume ... at some point there will be an answer,'' he
said. ``What that answer will be I cannot predict. We hope for the
best.''
   He said he made no threats and set no timetables, but pointed
out Congress' continued interest in linking China's most favored
nation trade status to improvement in its human rights policies.
   He said the U.S. Embassy in Beijing plans follow-up discussions.
   Kent Wiedemann, director of the State Department's Office of
Chinese and Mongolian Affairs, who accompanied Schifter, said all
of the Chinese officials they met ``agreed to continue contact on
the issues we raised.''
   Asked if his visit indicated a new acceptance by the Chinese
that human rights has a place in bilateral relations, Schifter
said, ``That seemed to be implied - that it was accepted.''
   Ambassador James Lilley called it a ``sea change'' in attitude
but cautioned, ``Whether this ends up in concrete results remains
to be seen.''
   China long has insisted that each country must set its own
standards for human rights and that foreign relations should be
based on pragmatic interests. Qian Qichen, the foreign minister,
repeated that stance in an article published only last week.
   The official Chinese media have carried only a single, brief
report on Schifter's visit and have not mentioned its purpose. As
recently as Monday, the party newspaper repeated charges that last
year's protesters secretly plotted to overthrow the government.
   Authorities have taken preparatory steps in recent weeks to
begin trials of the accused plotters. However, sources have said
the government plans to treat leniently the student leaders.
   Schifter said the Chinese told him the cases were not ready for
trial. He said he asked that the U.S. Embassy be notified when the
trials start and be allowed to send an observer if proceedings are
open. His request to visit a jail was rejected.
   Schifter said the talks were similar to meetings he had with
Soviet officials several years ago when he similarly submitted
lists of political prisoners. The Bush administration has said
previously said it did not think such a move would work in China.
   Schifter refused to release the list but said it included all
well-known participants in last year's movement and previous
democracy movements. He confirmed one name was that of Wei
Jingsheng, who is serving a 15-year jail term for advocating a
multiparty system in 1978.
   He also asked the Chinese not to punish Ge Xun, a Chnese
student who flew to Beijing from the United States last week in
hopes of attending the trial of an activist friend. Ge flew back
the the United States Wednesday after being told the case was still
being investigated.

   One of President Bush's top military
deputies in the Persian Gulf said today U.S. troops would not be
ready to mount an offensive by the Jan. 15 United Nations deadline
for Iraq to leave Kuwait.
   Lt. Gen. Calvin A. H. Waller, the deputy commander of all U.S.
forces in the gulf, voiced that assessment after a meeting with
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff Gen. Colin Powell and Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, field
commander of the American deployment.
   Waller told reporters the full American deployment would reach
about 430,00 troops by mid-January but that late-arriving armored
units would not be combat ready for some time, perhaps not until a
month past the jan. 15 deadline.
   Asked how he would respond if Bush wanted to order a strike on
Iraqi forces before the full complement of American ground forces
was ready, Waller said, ``I'd tell him, `No, I'm not ready to do
the job.''

   Police kept security tight around a
hospital and braced for more protests today after demonstrators who
said they wanted to reconnect Nancy Cruzan's feeding tube were
arrested before they could reach the comatose woman's room.
   Meanwhile, Barbara Shoun, a spokeswoman for the Missouri
Rehabilitation Center, said Ms. Cruzan's condition was downgraded
from stable to deteriorating. She declined to release other details
about the woman's condition.
   Police said 19 people, many clutching Bibles and rosaries, were
arrested Tuesday at the Missouri Rehabilitation Center, where the
33-year-old woman at the center of a landmark U.S. Supreme Court
right-to-die ruling lay.
   Eleven demonstrators made it to the second floor, where Ms.
Cruzan's private room is situated. Protesters knelt and prayed in
the hall before being dragged off.
   Probate Judge Charles Teel ruled Friday that Ms. Cruzan's
parents could order the feeding tube removed after he determined
there was sufficient evidence the woman would not have wanted to
live in a such a condition. Doctors said she will die in a week or
two.
   The Supreme Court had ruled in June that the state could prevent
Ms. Cruzan's parents from halting food and water in the absence of
``clear and convincing'' evidence that that was what she wanted.
Former co-workers then testified she told them she would not want
to live in such a condition.
   Ms. Cruzan has been in a coma since suffering brain damage in a
1983 car crash. Doctors say she has no chance of regaining
consciousness.
   Protest organizer Joseph Foreman said those arrested included a
nurse who knew how to connect the feeding tube.
   ``The best we can do is not cooperate with anyone trying to
starve an innocent person to death,'' said Foreman, acting director
of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue.
   Those arrested were charged with trespassing and unlawful
assembly and jailed on $500 bail. Sheriff's Lt. Ken Perkins said
the protesters identifed themselves as Nancy Cruzan and would not
be allowed to post bail until they gave their real names.
   The Rev. Ted Coleman, who was on chaplain duty at the hospital,
said Ms. Cruzan's parents, Joe and Joyce Cruzan, were aware of the
protests. ``They said, `We're private people. We just want to be
left alone,''' he said.

<TEXT>
   Three warring factions and Liberia's
West African-sponsored interim government are to meet Thursday to
try to fashion a cease-fire and end one of Africa's bloodiest power
struggles.
   The talks are being held in Banjul, Gambia. They begin four days
before the one-year anniversary of the rebel invasion that ousted
former President Samuel Doe and quickly evolved into a brutal
tribal conflict.
   During that time, more than 12,000 civilians have been
slaughtered and over 750,000 Liberians have fled to neighboring
West African nations. About half of Liberia's 2.3 million people
have been left homeless.
   Charles Taylor, a one-time government bureaucrat, led the rebel
effort that toppled Doe, whom he accused of gross corruption and
brutal oppression.
   Since then, Taylor's army - the largest of the three warring
factions - has overrun most of Liberia outside the capital,
Monrovia.
   Many Liberians accuse Taylor of prolonging the bloodshed since
followers of a breakaway rebel leader, Prince Johnson, allegedly
killed Doe in September after brutually torturing him.
   The third faction is composed of Doe loyalists.
   The warring factions disagree over the composition of a
temporary government to organize elections and on how to enforce a
cease-fire agreed at a summit of West African leaders in Bamako,
Mali on Nov. 28.
   An 8,000-man West African army, composed of troops from Gambia,
Ghana, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, and Guinea, has been sent to monitor
the cease-fire.
   Taylor has rejected the interim government set up by veteran
politician Amos Sawyer with the backing of other West African
nations. He refused an offer of six seats on Sawyer's Cabinet,
which includes four Doe loyalists and four members of Johnson's
faction.
   The interim government was appointed by a group of exiled
Liberians at an August meeting sponsored by the Economic Community
of West African States. A West African peace plan bans Sawyer from
contesting proposed 1991 general elections to ensure a fair
outcome.
   Both Johnson and the leader of the Liberian army, Brig. Hezekiah
Bowen, have accepted Sawyer's government.
   Taylor has set himself up as president of his own interim
administration and has insisted the other factions join his
government. They have all rejected the demand.
   It remains to be seen if Taylor will be tempted by Sawyer's
offer of more Cabinet positions and legislative seats. But his
immediate future depends on the West African army put together to
monitor the cease-fire.
   Taylor attacked the West African troops when they sailed into
Monrovia on Aug. 5. He agreed to stop fighting after the West
Africans retaliated, pushing his men out of Monrovia's eastern
suburbs and bombing his supply lines.
   Taylor questions the neutrality of the force, which is commanded
by a Nigerian general and has 4,000 Nigerian troops. Nigeria's
president, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, was a friend of Doe's.
   Taylor has accused the West African force of siding with
remnants of Doe's army, whom the West Africans are in the process
of relocating from barracks at the presidential mansion and a
nearby garrison to a camp 15 miles outside the capital.
   The move came after Johnson broke the cease-fire on Nov. 30 and
attacked the Doe loyalists, whom he and many Monrovians accused of
attacks on civilians. The West African army responded by attacking
Johnson's force, and the fighting ended two days later. Johnson's
men now are confined to a camp at Caldwell, a town northeast of
Monrovia.

   A Soviet official said today a contract has been
signed to allow an American to travel to the Mir space station,
despite a report by the official Soviet news agency that a
sweepstakes offering the trip was a hoax.
   ``The Soviet side agreed to it. We signed a letter of intent on
Nov. 22,'' said Vladimir Nikitsky, the deputy director of foreign
trade subsidiary of NPO Energia, which negotiates commercial deals
for the Soviet space program.
   The contest operators - who had pronounced the Tass news report
that the sweepstakes was a ``cosmic canard'' a misunderstanding -
appeared today before a grand jury.
   The district attorney's office Tuesday subpoenaed three
executives of Space Travel Services to answer questions on whether
the promotion, which contestants can enter by dialing a 900-number
for $2.99, violates Texas lottery laws.
   ``There's just so much information coming from so many sources
so fast we just had to look into it. We're dubious,'' said Russell
Turbeville, head of the consumer fraud division.
   Texas law bars charging people for a chance to win something.
   Space Travel insisted it has a contract with the Soviets. The
Houston company also said the contest is legal because people can
also enter by mail for free.
   ``We're looking forward to talking with them,'' James Davidson,
Space Travel senior vice president, said of the inquiry. ``Grand
juries investigate and this is a thing they're interested in. We
have done nothing wrong.''
   After the company began offering a chance to win a trip aboard a
Soviet rocket and a week on the space station, so many calls came
in from around the country that the telephone system handling them
collapsed Monday.
   By the time the system was restored Tuesday, Tass had called the
promotion a hoax.
   ``We basically have our contract in hand, so we know that we're
basically straight,'' said David Mayer, Space Travel president.
   A spokesman for Space Travel today expressed relief with the
acknowledgement from Soviet authorities that a contract existed.
   ``There's a break,'' Guy Brown said. ``There were a lot of
pieces of this that were secrets along the way, mostly to protect
Space Services.
   ``There were a lot of people who wanted to put a deal like this
together. I could understand why there would be large number of
people in that large a bureaucracy who wouldn't know about it.''
   Davidson said if the project falls through, callers will get
refunds. He said thousands had called the number.
   Space Travel spokesman George Nelson said the company has a
contract with NPO Energia for the trip aboard a Soyuz rocket to the
Mir station. The Soviet space agency Glavkosmos must approve any
contract.
   However, Tass said, ``Glavkosmos does not know anything about
this project,'' and it quoted Vladimir Zenkin, deputy commercial
manager at NPO Energia, as saying, ``There were no deals on the
subject.''
   Mikitsky declined to comment on the Tass report, saying that the
space deal was a ``commercial secret.''
   Asked why no one else in Glavkosmos or Energiya seemed to know
about the deal, he said: ``I am the only person responsible and I
don't want people to dwell on it.''
   Nelson said the Energia contract was signed by Uri Pavelovitch
Semenov, general designer in Energia's Moscow office, and was
delivered with a cover letter signed by Nikitsky.
   Space Travel also said it has a letter from Alexander I. Dunaev,
chairman of Glavkosmos, confirming that Energia has full authority
to sign that contract.
   The exact cost of the purported deal was not disclosed, but
Space Travel officials have said it was more than the $12 million
recently paid by a Japanese broadcast company to put a reporter
aboard the Mir station.
   The winner will be selected in a drawing in December 1991 for a
trip in 1992 or 1993, Space Travel said.
   Space Travel gets more than half the income from the 900 number
and said it hopes to lure advertisers eager to put their logos on
the winner's spacesuit and on the spacecraft.

<HEAD>Bush Won't Impose Anti-Whaling Sanctions on Norway</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush will not impose economic
sanctions on Norway even though it has refused to stop hunting
whales, the White House said Wednesday.
   The sanctions would have limited U.S. imports of Norwegian fish
products.
   ``We're very pleased with the president's decision,'' said
Ingvard Havnen, press counselor at the Norwegian Embassy.
   Earlier, Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher found that
Norway's whaling practices were hindering international efforts to
preserve whales. Such a ruling would normally result in sanctions
against the offending country. But in a letter to leaders of
Congress, Bush wrote:
   ``Norway has made improvements in the design of its research
program in each year and a reduction in the take of whales from 68
to five North Atlantic minke whales. ... Given the progress made in
the caliber of research undertaken and the efforts that have been
made to improve U.S.-Norwegian scientific consultations, I am not
directing that sanctions be imposed on Norwegian fish products.''
   The Norwegian government has maintained that it must take some
whales for research.
   Both Norway and the United States belong to the International
Whaling Commission, which tries to limit the killing of whales. The
commission has passed a resolution saying that Norway's whaling did
not meet its standards for research and asking Norway to reconsider
its plans.
   Norway replied that it had reconsidered, but was proceeding with
its whaling.

<TEXT>
   One of President Bush's top military
deputies in the Persian Gulf said today U.S. troops would not be
ready to mount an offensive by the Jan. 15 United Nations deadline
for Iraq to leave Kuwait.
   Lt. Gen. Calvin A. H. Waller, the deputy commander of all U.S.
forces in the gulf, voiced that assessment after a meeting with
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff Gen. Colin Powell and Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, field
commander of the American deployment.
   Waller told reporters the full American deployment would reach
about 430,00 troops by mid-January but that late-arriving armored
units would not be combat ready for some time, perhaps not until a
month past the jan. 15 deadline.
   Asked how he would respond if Bush wanted to order a strike on
Iraqi forces before the full complement of American ground forces
was ready, Waller said, ``I'd tell him, `No, I'm not ready to do
the job.''
   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater was
asked about Waller's remarks. ``What he really said is they might
not be as ready as they would like to be ... for all the
contingencies,'' he said.
   ``But we are assured they will be ready to do whatever they are
called upon to do,'' Fitzwater added.
   Cheney and Powell told reporters traveling with them that the
United States will be ready to go to war by the Jan. 15 deadline
regardless of whether all reinforcements have arrived and reached
combat-readiness.
   Cheney acknowledged some ground forces on the way to Saudi
Arabia from Kansas and Germany probably would not be combat-ready
by mid-January.
   Waller said he did not anticipate Bush ordering an attack
immediately if Saddam Hussein ignores the United Nations deadline
to withdraw his army from Kuwait.
   ``It's my understanding that he's been briefed and received
briefings that the forces will not be ready for combat activities
until sometime after the 15th of the month,'' Waller said in a
candid, 30-minute session with reporters traveling with Cheney and
Powell on their first joint visit to Saudi Arabia.
   Waller was the first senior military officer to say publicly
that he would oppose any U.S.-led military strike until the full
force was in place. His comments raised eyebrows among deputies to
Scharzkopf and Powell who said they were concerend that Waller had
been too candid.
   ``I would say to the president and to the secretary and to the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that until our full
complement of forces are on the ground that we should not initiate
hostile activities,'' Waller said.
   Cheney and Powell have more strategy sessions Thursday and
Friday morning before spending the rest of Friday and Saturday on
pre-Christmas visits with U.S. troops.
   ``We have an offensive capability should that be required,''
Cheney said. ``Most of the forces will be there by then (Jan. 15),
but obviously there is additional work to be done before you would
identify them as combat-ready.''
   Meanwhile, two senators just back in Washington from visiting
the gulf said they believe, based on talks with U.S. military
commanders, that the United States could conclude a war with Iraq
very quickly.
   ``We believe that with the strategic power we have, particularly
in the air and on the sea, that we should be able to complete the
mission in a very short time,'' Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, told
reporters after meeting with Bush.
   ``I think if there is a war, it will be a short one that will
last no more than five days,'' said Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii.
   Fitzwater said the senators were expressing their opinion based
on briefings, ``not any conclusion by our commanders.''
   ``Obviously our commanders feel confident about their strength
and superiority in many areas ... but we would be most reluctant to
try and put numbers of days on it,'' Fitzwater said.
   It was Cheney and Powell's third visit each to Saudi Arabia
since Iraq's Aug. 2 conquest of oil-rich Kuwait, but it is their
first joint visit and first opportunity to meet together with
Schwarzkopf since he moved his command post from Florida to Riyadh
in September.
   Neither plans to return to Saudi Arabia before the Jan. 15
deadline, and the Pentagon wants the joint visit to convey to
Saddam the administration's willingness to use force if necessary
to free Kuwait.
   But Cheney answered with a blunt ``no'' when asked if his visit
should be viewed as a final planning trip for war.
   On Monday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III told NATO
allies to expect a partial Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait as part of
a ``ploy'' to sway world opinion against a U.S.-led military
action.
   But Cheney said the Pentagon had no evidence Saddam was setting
the logistical stage for such a move. On the contrary, he said,
Iraq continues to pour more troops into Kuwait and southern Iraq,
primarily infantry but also some heavier armored forces.
   ``If he is planning to withdraw, we certainly haven't seen any
evidence of it,'' the secretary said.

<TEXT>
   The town bell of this 320-year-old New
England farming community has made a ringing comeback just in time
for the holidays, without interrupting anyone's silent nights.
   ``It's good to hear it ringing again,'' said A. Cory Bardwell,
who has lived next to the bell all his life.
   ``Because of the season more than anything, I thought it was
neat,'' said Selectman Thomas Hurley.
   The bell was silenced last May as a result of a civil suit
ordering the bell shut down at night. Town officials shut the bell
off entirely because they couldn't afford a timer. The lawsuit was
filed by a couple new to town who complained the bell kept them
awake.
   The 1,800-pound bell tolled the hours Wednesday from a
white-steepled church on Main Street thanks to a timer installed at
an estimated cost of $200 to $300, which will be paid for by
private donations, Hurley said.
   The return of the bell, owned by the town but housed in the
First Congregational Church which once doubled as Town Hall, comes
at a time when the famous Big Ben of London faces a potential snub.
   British Broadcasting Corp. officials say Big Ben's chimes, which
the BBC traditionally broadcasts to introduce the queen's Christmas
Day message and ring in the New Year, may not be used this year
because the main bell has lost its distinctive tone because of
repairs.
   Tuesday night in Hatfield, Jeffrey Tannatt and Randy Snyder
clambered into the church attic and installed the timing mechanism,
ringing to a close a dispute that began two years ago.
   Richard and Pamela Carnall, newcomers to town, moved from the
nearby city of Northampton to Hatfield, population 3,000, in August
1988, settling down in a 19th-century house on Main Street, next
door to the church.
   At that time, the town bell was broken. But in December, the
bell was fixed and started its hourly tolling, and the Carnalls
started waking up.
   The Carnalls tried but failed to convince town selectmen of
their plight, so they filed a civil suit.
   Old-timers grumbled that the ringing of the bell was a cherished
custom and an integral part of the New England charm of their
pretty town.
   The Carnalls, who have an unlisted telephone number, have
declined comment on the return of the bell.
   But at the time they won their case before a jury last May, they
said they were happy with the decision and only sought quiet
nights.
   ``They certainly never asked that the bell be turned off all
through the day and they just wanted it turned off at night. So I
guess that they're content,'' said W. Michael Ryan, who represented
the couple in their suit.

   President Bush calld German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl on Monday to discuss the collapse of international trade
talks, the White House said today.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the two leaders
discussed the importance of getting the trade talks ``started up
again.''
   The talks, under the auspices of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, were suspended indefinately earlier this month
after the United States and the 12-nation European Community failed
to agree on restricting farm-product subsidies.
   The United States would like to see the subsidies phased out.
   Fitzwater offered no details on the conversation.

<TEXT>
   In an age when less is more and calorie counting
is as American as the six-pack, distillers are introducing light
liquors - vodka, gin, rum and even whiskey - to attract a new
generation of drinkers.
   Light liquors let drinkers imbibe without getting fat from the
calories or drunk from too much alcohol, distillers say, and they
hope the holiday season will provide a good test market.
   But while light beer has established itself, light liquor may be
a harder sell.
   ``Sometimes the only way you can convince people this isn't
watered-down booze is to have them try it,'' said Brian Tyrol,
president of Vermont Distillers in Waterbury, Vt.
   Tyrol said his 60-proof light vodka does about 60 percent of the
business of the regular vodka; the light gin, about 45 percent. The
biggest customers are women and the elderly, he said.
   Tyrol said light vodka and gin have 82 calories per 50
milliliters, the amount in a nip, compared with 115 calories for
the regular, heavier version of those liquors.
   The idea of light liquors isn't new. Four years ago, M.S.
Walker, a bottler in Somerville, introduced light vodka, gin, rum
and scotch.
   ``We felt that the light category was exactly what was happening
in society,'' said Michael Brody, vice president and director of
sales for M.S. Walker. ``We felt this was a perfect opportunity.''
   But under liquor certification rules the products had to carry
the label ``diluted.'' M.S. Walker's light liquors bombed. ``When
people saw diluted they had a problem with that,'' Brody said.
   Then Seagram's, the giant Canadian distiller, got into the act,
introducing Mount Royal Light, a Canadian whiskey that is 54 proof
and has fewer calories.
   Because Seagram's added some flavorings to the light whiskey, it
could be classified as a specialty drink and didn't have to carry
the ``diluted'' tag.
   M.S. Walker followed the Seagram's flavoring strategy and about
six months ago introduced a 53-proof light vodka with a third fewer
calories. The light vodka sells about 5 percent of what M.S.
Walker's regular vodkas sell, Brody said.
   Next year the company plans to introduce a light rum. For the
holidays, M.S. Walker is introducing a light eggnog that goes easy
on the alcohol and calorie content.
   ``The restaurateurs like it with the liquor liability laws
today,'' Brody said. ``They can serve four drinks with the same
alcohol content as three.''
   Brody said the added flavorings smooth the alcoholic bite of the
light vodkas, giving them a taste similar to imported vodkas, which
also use flavorings. Regular American vodkas aren'tallowed to use
flavorings.
   Seagram's distills the flavor and the alcohol of its light
whiskey in separate tanks. Then some of the alcohol is thrown out,
and the remainder is blended and bottled.
   Despite the Seagram's example, most distillers jumping on the
light bandwagon prefer to stick with ``white'' liquors like vodka,
gin and rum.
   ``Whiskey is too macho a category for light liquor,'' Tyrol
said. ``If you're a whiskey drinker you're not looking for
something light. You really want the full impact.''

<HEAD>Report Says 72 Percent Drop in the Use of Cocaine Over Five Years</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Moves pvs grafs 20-23 up to 5-8.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today released figures showing
a 72 percent drop in the use of cocaine over five years. President
Bush said that shows ``our hard work is paying off.''
   ``There has been some marked progress - changing attitudes and
behaviors as more and more of our neighbors and co-workers have
turned away from illegal drugs,'' Health and Human Services
Secretary Louis Sullivan said in announcing the new figures.
   He said the number of people using illicit drugs was down 44
percent over the past five years, from 23 million in 1985 to 12.9
million in 1990.
   ``The news we have today sugggests that our hard work is paying
off,'' Bush said. He spoke briefly at a news conference called to
release the 1990 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse.
   Although the government study showed dramatic declines in casual
and moderate use of cocaine, it showed continued high rates of
frequent or intense cocaine use.
   Among 6.2 million people who used cocaine at least once in the
past year in 1990, the study showed approximately 662,000 people
used it once a week or more - down from 862,000 in 1988.
   However, the number of people who use cocaine daily actually
increased - to 336,000 for 1990 from 292,000 in 1988.
   The survey found that while the overall number of current
cocaine users decreased in 1990 from 1988, the number of
crack-cocaine users ``remained stable.'' There were nearly half a
million current crack users among the 1.6 million who used cocaine
at least once a month in 1990.
   Some of the report's other key findings:
   - Current cocaine use (use at least once in the past month) has
decreased 72 percent since 1985 and 45 percent since the last study
was conducted in 1988.
   - The number of current cocaine users dropped from 5.8 million
(2.9 percent of the population over age 12) in 1985 to 2.9 million
(1.5 percent) in 1988 to 1.6 million (0.8 percent) in 1990.
   - Marijuana remains the most commonly used illicit drug in the
country, although ``current'' use of marijuana declined from 1979,
when there were 22.5 million users (12.7 percent) to 1990, when
there were 10.2 million (5.1 percent) current users.
   - The number of adolescents using drugs fell by 13 percent from
1.8 million in 1988 to 1.6 million in 1990. Adolesents currently
using cocaine fell by 49 percent from 225,000 in 1988 to 115,000 in
1990.
   The survey was based on interviews with 9,259 people age 12 and
over.
   Bush said one of the most encouraging conclusions of the study
was the decline in drug use among teen-agers, which he called
``evidence they're learning to say no.''
   However, Bush said, ``A declaration of victory would be
premature,'' noting that drug use still remained an enormous
national health problem.
   ``There will be no retreat in our efforts to end the
inernational menace of drugs,'' he said.
   ``These figures must be greeted with guarded optimism,'' said
Sullivan. ``In spite of our individual and national efforts, there
are still millions of Americans trapped in the web of addiction,
poor health, violence, crime and death.''
   ``Despite this impressive good news about our progress in
reversing our nation's drug using habits, many pockets of serious
drug problems remain,'' the HHS secretary said.
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del.,
criticized the survey, saying it ``actually misses more addicts
than it counts.''
   A study by his committee's staff estimates some 2.4 million
people use cocaine at least once a week, not the 662,000 claimed by
the survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The committee
report says the number of such cocaine users actually has increased
by 200,000, rather than declining by that number as the NIDA survey
showed.
   Administration officials acknowledged that the NIDA survey
misses people in prison, in shelters and in other institutions such
as dormitories and that some 18 percent of the households contacted
declined to participate in the survey.
   But Dr. James O. Mason, assistant secretary for health, said the
NIDA survey's tracking of trends - if not the precise numbers of
users - are accurate as the survey has been administered the same
way each of the 10 times it has been conducted since 1971.
   Although not illicit drugs, alcohol and cigaratte use also were
tracked in the study, which showed declines in both categories.
   There were 102.9 million current drinkers of alcoholic beverages
- at least once in the past month - in 1990 compared with 113.1
million in 1985 and 105.8 million in 1988. Weekly alcohol drinkers
decrased from 54.6 million in 1985 to 47.3 million in 1988 to 41.7
million in 1990.
   Current cigarette users dropped from 60.3 million in 1985 to
57.1 million inThe88 to 53.6 million in 1990.
   ``This represents a decrease of 6.7 million persons smoking
cigarettes in the past five years,'' Sullivan said. ``I view this
as a remarkable achievement as more and more people start taking
responsibility for their own health.''

   A Saudi Arabian prince, who gave away
thousands of dollars during his sometimes controversial 5{-month
stay in a hotel, has departed with his wife and staff of 50.
   In a final gesture of good will Tuesday, Prince Turki Bin Abdul
Aziz Al Saud donated $30,000 to a police union's fund for disabled
children.
   The prince's destination was not disclosed for security reasons,
but a spokesman said he was flying out of state.
   The prince and his wife, Princess Hend, arrived in July to
accompany her father for kidney treatment at a Boston hospital and
to arrange a $1.5 million gift to Harvard Medical School to endow a
professorship in immunology.
   After Iraq invaded Kuwait in August, the prince stayed on in
what was described as an official mission to monitor American
response to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The 53-year-old prince is a former national defense minister of
Saudi Arabia and fourth in line to that country's throne, occupied
by his brother, King Fahd.
   Prince Turki and his party occupied two full floors of the
Charles Hotel, 40 rooms that usually cost $200 each a night. He had
a satellite dish installed on the roof and two secured lines for
communications with Saudi Arabia.
   He kept a fleet of limousines and drivers on call and paid
Cambridge and Harvard University police thousands of dollars for
working off-duty hours on security details.
   City Council warned the prince's entourage during his stay not
to drive stretch limousines across city parks, and some residents
said bodyguards ejected children from a park so the prince's
children could play there.
   During the visit, the royal couple gave a new playground to one
school, two college scholarship funds to another, three computers
to a third, and one year's financing for a multiracial program at a
fourth.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, they've been extraordinary neighbors
and wonderful visitors, and they should feel comfortable coming
back whenever they want,'' said Vice Mayor Kenneth Reeves.

<HEAD>Woman Receives $100 Every Year for Returning Man's Billfold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARKERSBURG, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honesty pays for Judy Miller. To be
exact, it pays $100 every year.
   Seven years ago, Miller, 46, found a wallet while Christmas
shopping.
   ``It was stuffed with money,'' Miller said. ``It would not go
shut there was so much money in it.''
   Miller said her first reaction was to leave the billfold where
it was. But having grown up in a family of 10 with little money,
she decided to hand the billfold over to a store employee.
   As she was telling a clerk about the wallet, a man ran up to her
and said, ``Oh, you found it,'' Miller said. The man's name matched
the one on the driver's license, so she handed it over.
   The man offered to buy Miller anything in the store, but she
refused.
   ``He didn't owe me anything,'' Miller said. ``Why should he pay
me for giving him something that was his?''
   Several days later, Miller received in the mail a leather jacket
she had tried on the night she found the billfold.
   ``I was tickled to death,'' she said. ``I thought that would be
it.''
   But it wasn't. The next year, she received a gift certificate,
and every year since, Miller has received $100 from the man, either
in cash or in a certified check. The man has asked to remain
anonymous, she said Tuesday.
   Miller, who works in a Belpre, Ohio, doll-making factory, said
she is surprised at the number of people who asked her why she
returned the billfold.
   ``How could I sleep at night knowing I had kept something that
belongs to someone else?'' she said. ``I hope if I ever lose a
wallet, someone will be honest enough to give it back to me.''

   Iraq told its people today to stockpile oil during the winter to
avoid shortages if war breaks out. A U.S. military commander said
American troops may not be fully prepared to attack Iraqi forces
for another two months.
   However, the White House said the tens of thousands of U.S.
soldiers in the Persian Gulf will be prepared to do whatever is
required.
   Meanwhile, Turkey, the only NATO nation bordering Iraq, also
appeared to be making preparations for a possible war in the gulf
region.
   A senior NATO source in Brussels, Belgium, where the Western
alliance is based, said today that Turkey recently asked NATO to
send several air units from its multinational force to bolster the
frontier region.
   The source said Turkey wants the units by Jan. 15, the date the
United Nations authorized the use of force if Iraq does not pull
out of Kuwait.
   The Iraqi Oil Ministry announced it will provide the market with
fuel oil, kerosene, cooking gas, gasoline and diesel so that
purchases can be made.
   ``We hope that all citizens will buy their needs so they may
overcome any shortages that might result from an aggression on our
oil installations,'' said the announcement, published in the
government's Al-Jumhuriya newspaper.
   The refineries are considered prime targets for air strikes by
the U.S.-led multinational force if war breaks out in the gulf.
   The announcement was Iraq's latest reported attempt to prepare
for war.
   Saddam Hussein has called up army reservists up to age 33,
ordered building owners to build bomb shelters, stepped up classes
in civil defense and first aid, and planned the evacuation of
cities.
   On Jan. 15, evacuation drills are scheduled in the capital,
Baghdad.
   In a television interview with Turkish journalist, Saddam said
Iraq has tried hard to avoid a war but that it is up to the
``international tyrants'' to make the decision to fight. The
interview, conducted in Baghdad on Friday, was scheduled for
broadcast tonight. A text was made available in advance.
   The U.S. military officer who commented on American readiness
for war is Lt. Gen. Calvin A. H. Waller, the deputy commander of
all U.S. forces in the gulf.
   Waller made his assessment after a meeting with Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney; the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
Gen. Colin Powell; and Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, field commander
of the American deployment.
   Cheney and Powell arrived in the gulf today on a visit intended
to emphasize U.S. willingness for fight.
   Waller told reporters the full American deployment would reach
about 430,000 troops by mid-January but that late-arriving armored
units would not be combat ready for some time, perhaps not until a
month past the Jan. 15 deadline.
   Asked how he would respond if Bush wanted to order a strike on
Iraqi forces before the full complement of American ground forces
was ready, Waller said, ``I'd tell him, `No, I'm not ready to do
the job.'''
   Asked about Waller's remarks, White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said in Washington: ``What he really said is they might
not be as ready as they would like to be ... for all the
contingencies. But we are assured they will be ready to do whatever
they are called upon to do.''
   Earlier today, Cheney and Powell told reporters traveling with
them that the United States will be ready to go to war by Jan. 15.
``Most of the forces will be there by then, but obviously there is
additional work to be done before you would identify them as
combat-ready,'' Cheney said.
   They refused to detail about what they would discuss with
Schwarzkopf, saying they did not want to tip their hand to Saddam.
   Cheney and Powell are to follow their military talks by spending
two days making pre-Christmas visits with U.S. troops in the
region.
   Turkey's reported request for several air units, which must be
approved by defense officials of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, marked the first time it had had asked NATO for
reinforcements.
   Turkey has cut off a key Iraqi oil pipeline to comply with
U.N.-imposed trade sactions against Iraq. But it has not sent any
troops to the U.S.-led multinational forces arrayed against Iraq,
making unclear what role, if any, Turkey plans to play if warbreaks out
in the gulf.
   Nevertheless, Turkey's armed forces of 800,000 are the second
largest in the NATO alliance after the United States, and 100,000
Turkish troops are along the border with Iraq, tying up eight Iraqi
divisions.

   Socialite Georgette Mosbacher wore the
fabulous Hope Diamond on Wednesday to publicize a $1 million gift
to the Smithsonian museum where it's displayed.
   Laughing at the diamond's legendary curse, she said: ``I'd wear
it in my navel for a million bucks.''
   Mrs. Mosbacher, president of a New York cosmetics company, was
the first person to wear the diamond and its diamond-studded
necklace publicly since it was given to the Smithsonian in 1958 by
New York jeweler Harry Winston, museum officials said.
   The wife of Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher fingered the
glittering, walnut-size, 45.5-carat diamond - valued at more than
$100 million - and confided to a horde of jostling photographers at
a mid-morning news conference:
   ``Of course, diamonds look best on bare skin, but it's the wrong
time of day.''
   ``Too bad for us,'' one photographer muttered.
   Instead of bare skin, Mrs. Mosbacher chose a tight-fitting mauve
knit dress with high, ruffled neckline to show off the
midnight-blue diamond that once adorned the bosoms of Marie
Antoinette and Countess DuBarry of France more than 200 years ago.
   ``I don't want to take it off,'' pouted Mrs. Mosbacher, who was
closely watched by an armed museum guard who stood unblinking a few
feet away.
   Mrs. Mosbacher wore the diamond as a publicity stunt to
celebrate a $1 million gift from the Harry Winston Research
Foundation for the renovation of the Geology, Gems and Minerals
Hall at the National Museum of Natural History, where the Hope
Diamond is exhibited.
   The renovation will cost about $12 million, with half the total
coming from private sources. It's scheduled to be completed in late
1994.
   Ordinarily, the diamond is kept in a museum vault behind
inch-thick glass, guarded around the clock by police, K-9 dogs and
sophisticated electronic devices.
   The museum's biggest tourist attraction, it's viewed by 6
million to 8 million visitors annually.
   According to legend, the diamond was stolen from the forehead of
an Indian idol worshiped by followers of Rama Sita. The god
supposedly placed a curse on the diamond, ensuring that tragedy
would befall anyone who subsequently owned or wore it.
   Paul E. Desautels, retired curator in charge of the National
Collection of Gems at the museum, has declared that the curse is a
``carefully nurtured fairy tale.''
   Nevertheless, the diamond's most famous owner - after French
King Louis XIV - was Washington socialite Evalyn Walsh McLean, who
had more than her share of troubles after buying the jewel in 1911.
   Her first-born son died of injuries from an automobile accident
when he was 9. Her husband was an alcoholic who died in an insane
asylum, and her only daughter died from an overdose of sleeping
pills.
   Mrs. Mosbacher said she's an optimist who doesn't believe in bad
luck, and had no qualms about slipping the Hope Diamond around her
neck.
   ``Anything that can attract $1 million from the private sector
for the Smithsonian has got to be good luck,'' she said. ``I told
them I'd wear it in my navel for a million bucks.''

<HEAD>Starts Up in November for First Time in 10 Months</HEAD>

   Housing starts rose in November for the first
time in 10 months, but construction of single-family homes
plummeted to a level not seen since the last recession, the
government said Wednesday.
   ``The declines in single-family starts and permits suggest we
haven't hit bottom yet, and there may be further deterioration in
the coming months,'' said economist John A. Tuccillo of the
National Association of Realtors.
   Thomas Holloway, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers
Association, agreed but added, ``The bottom is in sight and we see
improvement in the spring of next year.''
   The Commerce Department said starts of new homes and apartments
rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.13 million units,
advancing for the first time since a 23.2 percent gain in January.
   But the advance was due solely to a 102 percent rebound in
multi-family starts, which had dropped 28 percent a month earlier.
Multi-family starts totaled 357,000 at an annual rate in November.
   David G. Seiders, an economist with the National Association of
Home Builders, said the multi-family rate could not be sustained.
``There's no way that's going to happen,'' he said.
   But he and other economists were hard-pressed to explain the
pickup.
   ``The October level was too low and the November rate was too
high,'' Robert Sheehan, an economist with the National Apartment
Association, said. ``An average of the two levels at 267,000 units
is probably closer to the real trend.''
   Economists attributed the continuing weakness in the
single-family sector to steep inventories of unsold homes and
consumer uncertainty over the economy and the Persian Gulf. Some
also said that tight restrictions on credit were keeping marginal
buyers out of the market.
   ``Builders are facing up to the demand side of the market and
reacting to it,'' Seiders said.
   Applications for building permits, often a barometer of future
activity, fell 1.4 percent to 907,000, the lowest level since
888,000 forms were issued in April 1982.
   Until November, housing starts had fallen for nine months in a
row, the first time that has happened since the government began
keeping track of permits in 1959. During the first 11 months of the
year, starts were down 12.8 percent from the same period of 1989.
   Construction of single-family units totaled a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 772,000, down from 856,000 in October. It
was the lowest level since 737,000 units were started in October
1982.
   The multi-family activity was led by a rebound in buildings
containing five or more units - up 101.3 percent to 314,000 units.
These units had declined 26.8 percent in October.
   Housing starts rose 21.3 percent to 478,000 units in the South
and 5.4 percent to 274,000 in the West.
   But they were down 1.4 percent to 140,000 units in the
Northeast, which has seen some of the slowest housing activity in
recent months.
   Starts were unchanged at 237,000 units in the Midwest.

   Rock musician Frank Zappa doesn't view
the possibility of having a new high school named after him as a
compliment.
   Zappa's is among 132 names under consideration by the Antelope
Valley Union High School District board for its new school, set to
open in 1995.
   ``Considering the sorry state of education in California, it
would be more appropriate to name a high school after Ronald Reagan
than to name it after me,'' Zappa said Tuesday. He is a 1958
graduate of Antelope Valley High School, located here 60 miles
north of Los Angeles.
   Chuck Yeager, Lottery, Malcolm Forbes, Jovial, Euphoria,
Jackelope, Rustic, Unison, Dynasty, Xanadu, Zephyr, Zeppelin and
Fault Line High School are among the suggested names for the
school.

   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Country singer Willie Nelson won't have to
put his land on the auction block this month, but the IRS hasn't
forgotten about him.
   A Dec. 27 auction at the Travis County Courthouse won't take
place as advertised, Internal Revenue Service spokeswoman Jamie
Stewart said Tuesday.
   The IRS last month seized Nelson's properties in several states
to ensure payment of $16.7 million in taxes it says the Grammy
award-winning singer owes.
   Nelson says his tax problems were caused by poor handling of his
finances by a previous business manager.
   Officials are continuing to compile a list of Nelson's holdings,
Ms. Stewart said. Once that accounting is completed, probably
around the first of the year, an auction or auctions can be set for
all his property.
   Fund-raising efforts have been undertaken for Nelson and
donations have been received from several states, organizers say.

   LONDON (AP) - Italian film director Bernardo Bertolucci can go
ahead with a movie on the life of Buddha. A London court Wednesday
rejected a Hong Kong company's bid for an injunction stopping the
director.
   Waco Productions Ltd. of Hong Kong announced plans in September
to make a film based on the life of Buddha to be directed by
Bertolucci, whose previous films have included ``The Sheltering
Sky, ``The Last Emperor'' and ``Last Tango in Paris.''
   But negotiations broke down and the director announced that he
was seeking financial backers for an independent project on the
same theme.
   The film company claimed the idea for the film and an historical
synopsis shown to Bertolucci were original and confidential and
sought an injunction to stop him from exploiting the material.
   The court agreed that Waco Productions Ltd. chairman Richard
Colson had spent time and $1.4 million on planning for the film.
   But the judge said no injunction could be granted in such broad
terms, and that there was no evidence that Bertolucci was in any
way threatening to use any original or confidential ideas from
Waco.

   JERUSALEM (AP) - Violinist Yehudi Menuhin and composer-conductor
Luciano Berio are winners of Wolf Prizes in the arts for 1991.
   The awards, which carry $100,000 grants, were announced
Wednesday and will be presented in May at the Israeli Knesset, or
parliament. Prizes also will be awarded for chemistry, medicine,
physics, agriculture and mathematics.
   The selection committee said the musicians were chosen ``for
bringing peoples together through their musical achievements.''
   Menuhin, 74, who was born in New York City and now lives in
London, was a prodigy violinist, making his debut at age 7 in San
Francisco.
   The Wolf Foundation selection committee described him as ``one
of the greatest violinists of the 20th century.''
   Berio, 65, of Siena, Italy, was born to a family of musicians
and first studied music with his father and grandfather. He
composes, conducts, teaches and lectures.
   Berio is particularly noted for innovations in electronic music.
   The annual prizes, named for the late philanthropist Dr. Ricardo
Wolf, are intended ``to promote science and art for the benefit of
mankind.''

   Business leaders, scholars and cultural figures from 100 nations

   The telethon will benefit a restoration project to save the
city's crumbling landmarks and create a Russian emigre center, Tass
said.
   Baryshnikov, 42, defected from the Soviet Union in 1974 and
later became a U.S. citizen and a star in the United States.
   He attended the Vaganova Ballet School in Leningrad when he was

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Wednesday
mentioned four regions where political or ethnic unrest may force
him to impose a state of emergency or presidential rule. Here is a
look at the regions:
   
   BALTIC REPUBLICS - The republics of Latvia, Lithuania and
Estonia were independent between the two world wars but were seized
by Josef Stalin in 1940. They declared their independence this
year, although Gorbachev has rejected the declarations. Leaders of
the independence movements in the Baltics have claimed in recent
weeks that the Kremlin was preparing to crack down on them.
   
   SOUTH OSSETIA - Separatists in this northern region of Soviet
Georgia declared their own republic and elected a legislature in
September. In response, Georgia's parliament moved to end 68 years
of autonomy in South Ossetia and gave it the pre-revolutionary name
of Samchadlo. On Dec. 12, following three fatal shootings, a state
of emergency and curfew were declared in the area. Georgian and
national Interior Ministry troops were sent in, and tensions
reportedly remain high.
   
   NAGORNO-KARABAKH - More than 200 people have been killed,
including six in the past week, in a dispute between Armenians and
Azerbaijanis over this area of the Caucasus mountains. Although
predominantly Armenian, the territory has been controlled by
Azerbaijan since 1923. Martial law was imposed in January 1989.
   
   MOLDAVIA - This republic bordering Romania is simultaneously
seeking independence and trying to put down two internal separatist
movements. In the southern Gagauz region, about 150,000 descendants
of Christian Turks angered over the republic's moves to make
Romanian the official language have declared their own republic. In
the western Dniester region, Russians and Ukrainians similarly have
declared their own republic, leading to clashes that killed at
least four people in October.

   U.S. military commanders in the Persian Gulf
indicated a war with Iraq could be wrapped up within five days, two
senators said Wednesday after briefing President Bush on their trip
to the region.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, and Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii,
told reporters outside the White House that they got their
impression that any war would be short from classified and other
briefings during their tour of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and
Israel.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, asked about the
senators' comments, said, ``We would be most reluctant to try and
put numbers of days on it. ... We're not talking about war, we're
talking about a peaceful resolution.''
   But he also noted Bush's often-stated promise to avoid ``a long
drawn out Vietnam-type confrontation.''
   Fitzwater said there had been no new contact with Iraq on dates
or times for the proposed visit of Secretary of State James A.
Baker III to Baghdad or the White House visit by Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz.
   ``We get no response ... we don't see any opening,'' Fitzwater
told reporters about the stalemate over when to hold the two
meetings on resolving the Gulf crisis.
   Echoing Bush's comments of earlier in the week, the spokesman
said, ``We keep hearing Saddam Hussein doesn't really believe we
would take action'' if Iraq has not pulled its troops out of Kuwait
by the Jan. 15 U.N. deadline.
   ``We assume at least a degree of rationality that he would not
want to destroy himself and his country. Therefore we intend to
continue to try to use every means at our disposal to convince him
of the wisdom of pulling out,'' Fitzwater said.
   Asked about the senators' prediction of a five-day war,
Fitzwater said, ``I would attribute that to their calculations from
all of the things they heard as opposed to any one commander giving
that date.''
   Stevens told reporters: ``We believe that with the strategic
power we have, particularly in the air and on the sea, that we
should be able to complete the mission in a very short time.''
   Inouye said, ``If there is a war, it will be a short one that
will last no more than five days.''
   The senators, who returned home Tuesday night, declined to say
whether Bush agreed with their assessment.
   Their statements came as a senior U.S. military official in
Saudi Arabia said the U.S. command would not be ready to attack by
Jan. 15.
   But Inouye told reporters: ``With all the air power we have
there, with six carrier battle groups, with the B-52s, with our
missiles, with our rockets, with our fighter bombers, if we cannot
gain air superiority within six hours, let's say, wipe out their
missile sites and their command and control structures within
two-three days, then something is wrong with our defense
structure.''
   ``The troops are ready, the commanders are ready, the allies are
ready. The question is, is America ready,'' for a war, Inouye said.
   Inouye is the chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee
on defense, and Stevens is the ranking Republican on the panel.
   Bush also met Wednesday with a group of U.S. business leaders
who expressed their support for his policies in the gulf.
   They said they also discussed the economic impact of the gulf
crisis, particularly the hardship on Latin and other countries
where oil prices have escalated.

<HEAD>President to Consider Oil Import Tax</HEAD>

   President Bush will consider taxing imported
oil as part of a national energy strategy, the Department of Energy
said.
   The tax will be among some 67 policy options the department is
preparing for Bush, DOE spokeswoman Joelle Ziemian said late
Tuesday night.
   An import tax allows domestic oil producers to raise their price
and increase profits but it forces consumers to pay more for both
imported and domestic oil.
   Word of the possible tax drew immediate fire from New England
lawmakers who thought they had finally defeated the idea during the
October budget deficit debate.
   ``It's hard for me to believe that it's back, frankly,'' said
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. ``It will have a crippling and very
discriminatory effect on the Northeast.''
   Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass., the ranking Republican on the House
Appropriations Committee, criticized the proposal in a letter to
Bush, saying it was as an unfair burden on colder regions and
particularly areas such as New England that depend heavily on
foreign oil.
   The administration plans to consider the energy policy options,
including the import tax, then pare them down into a national
energy strategy'' expected to be proposed this spring.
   A study by the Northeast-Midwest Institute, a research group
that represents 18 states from Minnesota and Iowa to New England,
indicated the tax would cost each New Englander $133 per year,
higher than any other region. The Mid-Atlantic and Midwest states
were close behind with a per-person cost of about $100.
   DOE has not made public the specifics of the proposal, but a
common version has called for an import fee of $5 per barrel. Under
a ratio used by some oil industry analysts, that could translate
into an extra 12 cents per gallon of gasoline at the pump.
   Ziemian initially said the oil import tax idea ``was not an
option. It is not going to the President.'' But late Tuesday night,
she said her earlier statements were incorrect and that the oil
import tax proposal would go to Bush.

   Police questioned two women today in
connection with a series of slayings of middle-aged male motorists
in north Florida and south Georgia, but released them six hours
later.
   ``There is no reason to believe they had any connection with the
murders,'' said Asa Higgs, a spokesman for the Jacksonville
Sheriff's Office.
   Police Sgt. Steve Weintraub said earlier the two women were
picked up because they ``matched the descriptions somewhat.''
   All of the eight known victims were white, roughly between the
ages of 40 and 60. All were shot, some repeatedly. Some were
stripped naked and robbed, their bodies dumped along rural roads.
Two other men remain missing.
   Police, who have been chasing tips on sightings of two women
resembling composite sketches of the suspects, got word this
morning of two women who fit the depictions staying at the Gator
Lodge Motel on U.S. 1 south.
   Both women, who had been staying at the motel since Dec. 14,
originally gave police more than one name and age, Weintraub said.
But Higgs said later that their identities had been checked out and
the women were not the ones being sought for questioning in the
killings.
   Authorities in Volusia County reported some two dozen calls this
week about reports of two women hitchhiking near New Smyrna Beach.
   Marion County authorities say they have received some 250
unconfirmed sightings from all over the United States and Canada.
   Weintraub said Jacksonville authorities had been receiving calls
this week about two women along Interstate 295 ``attempting to flag
down (motorists) ... the two females were standing around a white
pickup truck. ...
   ``From what I understand ... that does fit these same methods''
used in the other slayings.
   Still, authorities are uncertain that all of the killings are
related.
   Two women seen leaving an accident scene near Gainesville in
July involving the stolen car of a part-time missionary are
considered suspects, however. The missionary, whose car had traces
of blood in it, remains missing, as does one other man.
   Police renderings of the suspects show an oval-faced,
stringy-haired blonde and a chubby, round-faced, dark-complexioned
woman wearing a baseball cap.

<TEXT>
   A suspected terrorist who hid out in East
Germany for years was charged Wednesday in a 1979 attempt to kill
former NATO chief Alexander Haig and with the 1977 murder of a
prominent West German banker.
   Susanne Albrecht, 39, was among 10 alleged members of the
notorious Red Army Faction who were rounded up in the former East
Germany this past summer.
   The Communist East German government allegedly arranged refuge
for the West German terrorists.
   The leftist Red Army Faction, founded in the 1970s, is one of
Europe's most infamous terrorist gangs.
   Ms. Albrecht has told law officials she was sent by the Red Army
Faction to East Germany in 1979 to avoid arrest and that East
German government leaders gave her a new identity.
   She was arrested outside her East Berlin apartment on June 6.
   Ms. Albrecht was charged Wednesday with murder, attempted
murder, and attempted kidnapping.
   According to the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe, she
is accused of murder in the July 30, 1977 killing of Dresdner Bank
spokesman Juergen Ponto.
   Ms. Albrecht was a friend of the Ponto family and allegedly
helped her co-conspirators gain entry to his home. Ponto was killed
by pistol shots when he resisted, law officials say.
   Two others were convicted of killing Ponto and handed lifelong
prison terms.
   The prosecutor's office also alleged that Ms. Albrecht helped
plan a June 25, 1979 attack on Haig in Belgium, in which a bomb
exploded seconds after Haig's car drove by. Three security
officials traveling behind Haig's car were slightly injured.
   Two Red Army Faction members were arrested soon after the
attack.
   Ms. Albrecht is also accused of taking part in a failed Aug. 25,
1977 attempt to bomb the federal prosecutor's office.
   She could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted.
   Many of the Red Army Faction's leaders are currently serving
prison terms. However, it is continuing its terror campaign.
   Alfred Herrhausen, head of the Deutsche Bank, was killed on Nov.
30, 1989 when a sophisticated bomb demolished his car.
   On June 27, 1990, a top official in the West German Interior
Ministry, Hans Neusel, survived a similar attack.
   The Red Army Faction emerged in the 1970s from Germany's radical
leftist scene, launching a campaign against West German capitalism
and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

   The Army said Wednesday it has alerted three
National Guard and Reserve MASH units to prepare for mobilization
and deployment to the Persian Gulf.
   Also put on alert were two Army Reserve combat support hospitals
and one general hospital, plus a variety of medical specialists
from Army Hospitals nationwide.
   The mobilizations are part of a broad Pentagon push to
strengthen medical support and supplies in the gulf as the pace of
U.S. troop deployments increases.
   The three Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, or MASH, units put on
alert are: the 159th Medical Hospital of the Louisiana National
Guard at Jackson Barracks in New Orleans; the 300th Medical
Hospital of the Tennessee National Guard at Smyrna; and the 807th
Medical Hospital of the Army Reserve at Paducah, Ky.
   Maj. Hooper Penuel, a spokesman for the Tennessee Guard, said
the 300th Medical Hospital reported for active duty Dec. 9 and its
230 members are at Fort Campbell, Ky., awaiting further orders. The
Army announcement said the unit had been placed on alert but not
yet activated.
   At least three other MASH units from the Guard and Reserve had
been called up earlier in Operation Desert Shield.
   The units, made famous by the television series ``MASH,''
provide surgical and other emergency treatment of battle casualties
at the rear of the combat zone.
   Also put on alert were Guard and Reserve units in a variety of
medical-related specialties, including general medical service,
dentistry, preventive medicine, blood distribution, air evacuation
and veterinary services. Veterinarians inspect meat used for
troops.
   Last week, the Navy said it was adding two 500-bed combat-zone
field hospitals in Saudi Arabia and calling up thousands more
reserve medical specialists.

   A new indictment in the 1963 sniper
killing of Medgar Evers gives Mississippi a chance to show how much
it has changed, the widow of the slain civil rights leader said
Wednesday.
   ``This is a time Mississippi can shine before the rest of the
county and the world and say, `We are not what you have always
imagined us to be, that we are on the move and that there's
potential here,''' Myrlie Evers said Wednesday in a telephone
interview from her Los Angeles home.
   ``And Mississippi, one day, as Medgar said, might be the example
for the rest of the states to follow.''
   Byron De La Beckwith, a segregationist who twice stood trial for
Evers' death, faces a new murder charge in the case. He was freed
on $15,000 bond Tuesday from a Chattanooga, Tenn., jail. A hearing
was set for Feb. 22 on whether he should be returned to Mississippi
to stand trial a third time.
   Prosecutors said new witnesses, including a former Ku Klux
Klansman, led to a new murder charge against Beckwith.
   The retired fertilizer salesman, who has said he did not kill
Evers, said Wednesday he is trying to publish a book that would
reveal Evers' killer, and is now granting only paid interviews.
   ``That's legal expenses. You know I don't have any money for a
lawyer. I've spent what I've inherited three times,'' Beckwith said
from his home in Signal Mountain, Tenn. ``That's the only way I can
do it now.''
   Beckwith's fingerprint was found on the rifle used by a sniper
to kill Evers. He said the weapon was stolen from his home. Two
all-white juries deadlocked in 1964 trials and the murder charge
eventually was dropped.
   ``Justice can be only served if there is a final conclusion,
once and for all,'' District Attorney Ed Peters said Tuesday in
announcing the indictment of Beckwith by a grand jury in Jackson.
   Peters said new witnesses, black and white, ``have taken the
courageous step of coming forward.'' He said their identities were
being protected.
   Assistant Hinds County District Attorney Bobby DeLaughter, who
led the new inquiry, said information from Delmar Dennis, a
one-time Klansman who later became an FBI informant, helped bring
the new indictment.
   Dennis was quoted in a 1975 book on the Klan as saying Beckwith
told him he shot Evers. DeLaughter said other new witnesses
corroborated his story.
   The Rev. Robert L.T. Smith of Jackson also has said he is a new
witness.
   Smith, 88, said he saw Beckwith at a church gathering in Jackson
the night Evers was slain.
   That would contradict testimony in the 1964 trials from two
white police officers who said Beckwith was not at the church
rally. Beckwith contends he was not in Jackson when Evers was shot
in his driveway.
   Evers, 37, was the field secretary for the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People at the time of his death. He
was active in voter registration efforts and other attempts to
bring racial equality to the South.
   The assassination, called ``barbaric'' by President Kennedy,
focused national attention on the civil rights struggle in
Mississippi and helped push forward civil rights reforms.
   Mrs. Evers said Wednesday that more important than a murder
conviction is that her husband reaches his deserved place in
history.
   ``I want a trial, a conviction, and after that, my emphasis
shifts to people becoming more and more aware of who Medgar was ...
and to realize that Medgar Evers was a pioneer,'' she said.

<HEAD>Administration Lifts Opposition to U.S.-Soviet Satellite Phone

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has dropped its
opposition to a plan by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. to
provide additional phone service to the Soviet Union through an
East Bloc satellite consortium.
   AT&amp;T, citing a 140 percent increase in U.S.-Soviet phone traffic
from 1987 through 1989, began seeking federal permission 12 months
ago to provide about 100 additional phone circuits to the Soviet
Union through the Intersputnik system.
   The State Department said in May that it saw no reason to
deviate from existing U.S. policy that requires most satellite
telephone traffic between the two countries to be carried by the
119-nation Intelsat satellite cooperative.
   However, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger and
Deputy Secretary of Commerce Thomas J. Murrin reversed course in a
Dec. 14 letter to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Alfred
Sikes.
   The officials said the modest nature of the AT&amp;T proposal
alleviated U.S. concern that Intelsat would suffer from the
competing service.
   ``The administration views this action as an important step in
promoting business development and commerce between the United
States and the Soviet Union,'' the State Department said in a
prepared statement.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said the company was pleased with the
administration's change of heart.
   AT&amp;T has about 60 circuits to the Soviet Union by means of
Intelsat, undersea cables and land lines. AT&amp;T uses about 22,000
Intelsat circuits worldwide.
   The company said demand for phone calls to the Soviet Union was
far exceeding AT&amp;T's ability to carry them and proposed splitting
future circuit increases between Intelsat, Intersputnik and
undersea cables.
   AT&amp;T had sought permission from the FCC to build a new satellite
antenna at AT&amp;T's Roaring Creek earth station near Catawissa, Pa.,
to transmit calls to an Intersputnik satellite above the west coast
of Africa. The FCC has not acted on the application.
   AT&amp;T said the Soviet Union preferred to use its own satellite
system for additional phone circuits because Moscow then incurs
expenses solely within the Soviet Union, payable in rubles rather
than in Western currencies.
   Rubles are not traded officially in international money markets.
   Intersputnik is a consortium of 15 formerly communist countries
that provides satellite-delivered communications among its member
nations.

   German unification could raise interest rates
in the United States by at least a full percentage point after
1992, a congressional study released Wednesday said.
   The congressional Joint Economic Committee, which requested the
study, said in a statement that ``if Germany finances higher
government spending with higher borrowing, real short-term interest
rates are estimated to be a full percentage point higher in the
1990s'' in the United States.
   The study, by the Congressional Budget Office, projected that
the interest rate hike in the United States could be 0.6 percent
next year, 0.9 percent by 1992, 1 percent by 1993 and 1.1 percent
by 1994.
   The study said that if the German government helps its new
eastern states with tax money, there would be little international
effect. But Chancellor Helmut Kohl recently won the first election
since unification after a promise not to raise taxes. Higher taxes
would replace higher borrowing.
   The committee said that much of the money the United States
borrows comes from the savings of Germans. That borrowed money goes
to cover the deficit in the federal budget and to pay for imports.
If the German government borrows more of its people's savings for
its own purposes, interest rates could rise in both countries.
   German government borrowing could have other effects too, the
study said. It found that in 1992 it could cause a small drop in
American production and a potential increase in U.S. exports of
$15.9 billion.
   The report pointed out that the reduction of the military threat
from eastern Europe could save the United States money on defense,
but did not offer a figure. The study did not cover the Soviet
Union itself.
   ``The transformation of eastern Europe should have its most
significant impact on the U.S. economy in two ways: By slightly
raising U.S. interest rates ... and by enabling lower defense
expenditures - a peace dividend arising from the end of the Cold
War,'' the study said.
   Exports to eastern Europe could increase by as much as $6
billion in 1994, it estimated.

   The Bush administration said Wednesday that
U.S. allies have contributed more than $9 billion to support the
American military campaign against Iraq and ``we are satisfied.''
   Several members of Congress have criticized the allies'
contribution as inadequate. For example, Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn.,
said in an article in The New York Times that Saudi Arabia was
reaping a windfall profit of some $150 million a day in increased
oil sales and have contributed only $987 million in cash and
material - equivalent to about 6.5 days' worth of those profits.
   The State Department, in releasing the $9-billion figure,
declined to specify how much Saudi Arabia or any other individual
members of the makeshift alliance had contributed to defense of the
Saudi oilfields. Germany and Japan also have been targets of
congressional criticism.
   ``Yes, we are satisfied,'' Richard Boucher, a State Department
spokesman, said. ``Of course, this is a continuing effort and we
will expect continuing contributions from ourselves as well as
other nations that are involved in this effort.''
   On a related subject, Boucher said ``there's been no sign of
movement'' from Iraq in a dispute with the administration over
arrangements for Secretary of State James A. ho is chairman of the Senate
Budget Committee, said
Japan had pledged $4 billion to the gulf effort and had paid $374
million through Nov. 30. Germany, he said, had offered $900 million
and paid $330 million.
   The Pentagon said last week it would ask Congress for up to $20
billion to maintain Operation Desert Shield. The projected cost
through the end of this year is $8.2 billion.
   Sasser said a full-scale shooting war could cost the United
States $1 billion to $2 billion a day.

   Personality tests used by some businesses to
assess job applicants are backed by flawed research that generally
fails to demonstrate the tests predict job performance, two experts
said.
   ``We see precious little evidence that even the best personality
tests predict job performance,'' wrote Steve Blinkhorn and Charles
Johnson.
   They are directors of Psychometric Research &amp; Development
Limited of St. Albans, Hertfordshire, England, which designs and
tests assessment systems for businesses. Their commentary appears
in Thursday's issue of the British journal Nature.
   The analysis was criticized by American psychologists and test
publishers, who said the research shows the tests can predict
aspects of job performance.
   The two also said many American companies avoid personality
tests anyway because of skepticism, privacy issues and the
requirements of federal anti-discrimination guidelines.
   In the Nature paper, Blinkhorn and Johnson discussed their
informal survey of research on the prediction power of three
personality tests used for employee selection and assessment.
   In reporting correlations between test performance and later job
performance, the studies generally used an inappropriate
statistical approach, Blinkhorn said in a telephone interview. A
more appropriate analysis of the research results, Blinkhorn said,
suggests that most of the time the tests ``are doing no better than
chance.''
   But that analysis overlooked successful predictions because it
did not look at how particular personality characteristics relate
to particular aspects of job performance, said psychologist Leaetta
Hough.
   ``If you analyze what it is you're trying to predict, there are
sensible relationships between personality and those performance
factors,'' said Hough, who has studied personality tests in
employment settings.
   The predictions are not perfect, but they can indicate such
factors as willingness to work hard, striving for outstanding
results, dependability and satisfying clients, said Hough,
executive vice president of the Personnel Decisions Research
Institute in Minneapolis.
   She and other experts stressed that personality tests should not
be used by themselves for personnel decisions, but rather as part
of a package of information about a person.

   American troops will not be ready to
attack Iraq until weeks after the Jan. 15 U.N. deadline for Saddam
Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait, the deputy commander of U.S.
forces in the Persian Gulf said Wednesday.
   Some crucial heavy ground forces likely will not even have
arrived in Saudi Arabia by the deadline, and commanders are urging
President Bush to delay any offensive action until the deployment
is completed, Army Lt. Gen. Calvin A.H. Waller said.
   If Saddam ignores the deadline and Bush wants to order an attack
in the days immediately following Jan. 15, ``I'd tell him, `No. I'm
not ready to do the job,'' the general said.
   Waller said he believed Bush was aware of the readiness
timetable but said it would be stressed again in three days of
meetings that began Wednesday between field commanders and Bush's
top two military officials, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell.
   Bush said Monday that U.N. resolutions against Iraq, which
include one authorizing force if Iraqi troops aren't out of Kuwait
by Jan. 15, should be enforced ``right on schedule.''
   At the White House, presidential press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said Wednesday when asked about Waller's comments, ``What
he really said is they might not be as ready as they would like to
be ... for all the contingencies.''
   ``We are assured they will be ready to do whatever they are
called upon to do,'' Fitzwater said.
   In Saudi Arabia, aides to Powell and to Waller's immediate boss,
Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, expressed concern that Waller had been
too candid in discussing U.S. readiness and deployment in his
meeting with reporters just after an initial meeting with Cheney
and Powell.
   Speaking privately, several senior military officials suggested
that his comments could undermine diplomatic efforts based on
persuading Saddam to take the Jan. 15 deadline seriously.
   Cheney fired former Air Force chief of staff Gen. Michael Dugan
in September after Dugan talked openly of the likelihood of bombing
certain Iraqi military and economic targets if hostilities began.
   Waller was the first senior military officer to say publicly
that the American deployment will reach 430,000 troops when
completed. But he said several vital components still were missing,
including Navy carriers due to leave home port just after
Christmas, combat aircraft due to arrive by Jan. 15, and some
117,000 Army armored forces coming from Fort Riley, Kan., and from
Germany.
   Some of the latter group, Waller said, might not arrive until
late January. And even if the troops did arrive by the U.N.
deadline, he said, ``there's a distinct possibility that every unit
will not be fully combat ready until sometime after the first of
February.''
   Likening himself to a football coach, Waller said:
   ``I certainly want everything that I can possibly get and have
at my side of the field when I get ready to go into the Super Bowl.
... I would say to the president and to the secretary and as well
to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that until our full
complement of forces are on the ground that we should not initiate
hostile activities.''
   Of Bush, Waller said: ``It's my understanding that he's been
briefed and received briefings that the forces will not be ready
for combat activity until sometime after the 15th of the month.''
   In Washington, meanwhile:
   - Sens. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, and Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, said
that on their just-concluded trip to the gulf U.S. military
commanders indicated a war with Iraq could be wrapped up within
five days. The senators commented after briefing Bush on their trip
but declined to say if the president shared their assessment.
   - White House spokesman Fitzwater said there had been no new
contact with Iraq on dates or times for the proposed visit of
Secretary of State James A. Baker III to Baghdad or the White House
visit by Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz. ``We get no response
... we don't see any opening,'' Fitzwater said.
   - The State Department said U.S. allies had contributed more
than $9 billion to support the American gulf effort and ``we are
satisfied.'' Several members of Congress have criticized the
allies' contribution as too small.
   - The White House announced that Vice President Dan Quayle will
visit the U.S. troops in the gulf on a Dec. 29-Jan. 2 trip during
which he will also meet with Saudi King Fahd.
   In Saudi Arabia, Cheney and Powell had nothing to say publicly
Wednesday after the initial round of meetings. Speaking to
reporters en route to Saudi Arabia, however, Cheney said concerning
the Jan. 15 date, ``Most of the forces will be there by then, but
obviously there is additional work to be done before you would
identify them as combat ready.''
   As for Saddam's intentions, Cheney said he saw no evidence that
the Iraqi president planned even a partial withdrawal from Kuwait,
a move some have suggested he might make in an effort to weaken the
international coalition demanding a total pullout.
   ``He might move the pieces around on the board, but our
objective is for him to get all of that stuff out of Kuwait - not
half of it, not 75 percent of it, not 10 percent of it, all of
it,'' Cheney said.
   Powell said he did not want to discuss any U.S. combat plans
because doing so could help Saddam.
   ``I want him to sit there in beautiful downtown Baghdad and
worry his butt off about it,'' Powell said.
   Cheney and Powell are to meet with American and Saudi military
officers Thursday and Friday morning before splitting up to make
pre-Christmas visits to some of the 270,000 U.S. troops already in
the gulf region.

   A 65-year-old woman was mauled to
death at an amusement park Wednesday when the leopard she was
feeding seized her by the neck and dragged her into its cage,
authorities said.
   Francesca Arnetti of Torre Annunziata, an Italian town 5 miles
from Naples, died from wounds to the neck and head, the news agency
ANSA reported.
   After the attack, the leopard ran into the basement of a nearby
restaurant. Police fired tear gas into the restaurant and shot the
animal to death.
   Authorities are unsure how the leopard, part of the amusement
park's animal exhibit, escaped its cage.

   Breast cancers may recruit normal tissue to help
launch their invasion of other parts of the body, a discovery that
may open a new target for therapy, a study suggests.
   Scientists identified a gene that is activated in normal cells
surrounding invasive breast cancers, spurring the normal cells to
produce an enzyme that may help cancer cells spread from the
original tumor.
   The makeup of the gene suggests that this enzyme may degrade
normal tissue surrounding a tumor, creating pathways for the cancer
cells to escape, scientists reported in Thursday's issue of the
British journal Nature.
   The enzyme, which the scientists dubbed stromelysin-3, is
produced by stromal cells, which make up supporting structure
within breasts, the scientists said.
   Apparently, breast cancers produce some kind of substance that
activates the stromal cells to produce the enzyme, they suggested.
The enzyme may be a new target for cancer therapy, they said.
   The work was reported by Pierre Chambon and colleagues at the
Institute of Biological Chemistry of the National Institute of
Medical Research in Strasbourg, France.
   Dr. Lance Liotta, a National Cancer Institute expert on how
cancer spreads, said it was unclear what the discovery means for
cancer treatment. For one thing, nobody knows whether the enzyme
really helps cancers spread or whether it provides a defense, he
said Wednesday.
   Liotta said scientists had previously identified other enzymes
that help cancers spread by destroying tissue. These substances are
created by cancer cells themselves, he said.

<TEXT>
   Here is the text of President Bush's 1990
Christmas message, released Wednesday:
   At Christmas, people of every age and every walk of life
celebrate with a profound sense of wonder, joy and gratitude our
Savior's birth in Bethlehem. Like the shepherds called from nearby
fields and the Magi who journeyed from distant lands to welcome the
Christ Child, we are drawn to this miraculous event in history.
   Born in a stable and greeted by a handful of faithful and
obedient men, Christ came to assume the role of a shepherd, thus
fulfilling the words of the prophet Isaiah: ``He shall feed his
flock like a shepherd: He shall gather the lambs with his arm and
carry them in his bosom.'' Christ's brief time on earth was devoted
to tending the physical and spiritual needs of his flock: healing
the sick, feeding the hungry and illuminating the path to eternal
salvation. His incarnation radically altered the course of human
history by challenging men and women to live according to the will
of our just and merciful Father in heaven. Today's Christ's message
of hope and redemption - first delivered on that holy night in the
city of David - continues to bring peace and joy to millions of
people around the world.
   As we give and receive the goodwill of Christ during this holy
season, let us be mindful of the true meaning of his life on earth
and especially of his greatest commandment: to love God with all
our heart and to love our neighbor as ourself. Events during the
past year have given us a renewed sense of hope, yet in some parts
of the world, peace remains an elusive blessing this Christmas.
Even in some of our own cities, poverty, despair, and drug-related
violence prevent families and individuals from sharing in the
promise of this season. Therefore, let us strive, by following
Christ's example in word and deed, to make peace on earth a reality
for all of God's children.
   Barbara joins me in wishing all of our fellow Americans a Merry
Christmas. May this festive and holy season be filled with the
warmth of family and friends and with the deep joy of knowing God's
love for mankind through the gift of his Son. God bless you.
   George Bush

<TEXT>
   Market prices of major farm commodities will
be mixed in the coming year as some rise because of declining
supplies while others decline because of abundance, the Agriculture
Department said Wednesday.
   A new outlook report by the department's Economic Research
Service said world output of grain, oilseeds and meat is rising in
1990-91.
   ``Consumption, however, is forecast to grow more oderately, and
ending stocks of some commodities are expected to rise,'' the
report said.
   In the United States, the average prices in the 1990-91
marketing years for various crops will show a variety of reactions.
   The average prices of wheat, milk, barley, oats and rice are
expected to be lower than a year earlier, while the prices of corn,
soybeans and most meats will hold about steady or rise slightly,
the report said.
   Meanwhile, the mix of crops farmers plant in 1991 will probably
change more than in recent years, it said.
   ``Farmers will be reacting to the planting flexibility
provisions of the new farm (law) and will be more responsive to
changing market prices,'' the report said. ``If yields revert to
trend and planted acreage remains steady, foreign grain output
could decline as well, perhaps lending some support to prices.''

   UNITED NATIONS - The United States on Wednesday appeared close
to endorsing U.N. Security Council efforts to protect Arabs in the
Israeli-occupied lands, denounce their deportation and back a
Mideast peace conference.
   The Security Council has been holding intensive consultations to
avert a U.S. veto and to reconcile Western and nonaligned draft
resolutions.
   U.S. officials are trying to find a way out of a diplomatic
vise, squeezing them between their longstanding ties to Israel and
their newfound attachment to Arab allies in the anti-Iraqi
coalition.
   Western diplomats said Wednesday that agreement on a Finnish
draft resolution that could be supported by the United States
appeared to be at hand, although some textual problems remained.
Nonaligned diplomats indicated that more serious problems may
remain.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering told reporters Wednesday
after consultations that the United States could vote in favor of a
draft resolution submitted by Finland ``in its integrity,'' but
amendments were expected.
   A Security Council meeting and vote was rescheduled to Thursday
morning. It has been delayed seven times the past two weeks,
largely at U.S. urging.
   The United States is trying to avoid exercising its veto of a
resolution critical of Israel, which fiercely opposes an
international Mideast conference. U.S. officials fear a veto, which
they can exercise as a permanent council member, would anger Arab
allies and thus undermine the anti-Iraqi coalition.
   The United States has been trying to remove any mention of a
Mideast peace conference from a resolution and shift it to a
nonbinding presidential statement accompanying the resolution.
   Complicating matters, U.S. officials also want to avoid any
appearance of bowing to Iraq's demand that a Persian Gulf
settlement be tied to a solution of the Palestinian problem. Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein has called for a Mideast peace conference.
   The U.S. government, which supports considering a peace
conference at an unspecified time in the future, has disavowed any
linkage between Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, invaded on Aug. 2, and the
Israeli-occupied lands.

   Leaders of the Palestinian uprising on
Wednesday called a strike in Bethlehem for Christmas Eve, but
Israeli officials said government-sponsored holiday programs would
go on as scheduled.
   A Palestinian strike, which would close all of Bethlehem's
tourist shops and restaurants on Dec. 24, ``will make for a gloomy,
gloomy Christmas,'' admitted Tourism Ministry spokesman Yossi
Shoval.
   But, he added, ``There will be no change in our Christmas
events, with or without their support.''
   The main government-sponsored event on Christmas Eve is an
evening choir performance in Bethlehem, which is in the occupied
West Bank. Religious activitis include a procession into the
Church of the Nativity led by the Roman Catholic patriarch of
Jerusalem, a Protestant prayer service in nearby Shepherd's Field
and midnight Mass.
   The Israeli army posts hundreds of troops in Bethlehem at
Christmas to man roadblocks and metal detectors that visitors must
pass through to reach the church, where Christian tradition says
Christ was born.
   It is the fourth consecutive year that the underground
Palestinian leadership has called a strike in Bethlehem to
underscore the uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   The leaflet calling the strike said it was also ``due to the
gulf crisis.'' Many Palestinians support Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
   Earlier, Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij said the municipality would
cancel traditional Christmas parades and receptions again this year
in solidarity with the uprising.
   Bishop Samir Kafity, the Anglican bishop of Jerusalem, told a
meeting of visiting American Christian leaders on Wednesday he
understood the frustration of his fellow Palestinians.
   ``How can we celebrate the birth of the prince of peace if we
have no sign of this peace coming?'' he said.
   He predicted ``more soldiers than worshipers'' in Bethlehem at
Christmas.
   Shoval said the Tourism Ministry expects about 7,000 people to
visit Bethlehem this holiday season, one-third fewer than last year
and down sharply from before the uprising began.
   ``Considering the gulf crisis, it's an okay number,'' he said.
   Several American, Hungarian and German church choirs that were
expected to perform on Christmas Eve in Bethlehem have canceled
their trips, apparently out of concern about the gulf crisis, other
ministry officials said.
   The only two currently scheduled to perform are the chancel
choir of the First United Methodist Church of Oklahoma City and
Jerusalem's Living Stones Community Choir.

<TEXT>
   America's compassion for the hungry and
homeless is losing ground to hostility and frustration over
problems that won't go away and will only get worse, the United
States Conference of Mayors said Wednesday.
   The conference, in its report on hunger and homelessness in
America's cities, also warned of a growing gap between the plight
of the needy and the resources to help them.
   The survey of 30 cities found that requests for food aid were up
22 percent in 1990, while demand for emergency shelter increased by
24 percent. By comparison, emergency food resources were up only 4
percent, and available shelter beds increased by 3 percent.
   The report, compiled annually since 1985, cited insufficient
low-income housing, inadequate care of the mentally ill, illicit
drugs and the weak economy for the increasing numbers of the
desperately poor. What is equally troubling, it said, is that
Americans are losing the will to care.
   Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn spoke at a news conference of the
``growing hostility'' toward those in need of a helping hand.
``What should disturb the American people is the growing
intolerance that too many people feel toward the social and
economic problems that are facing America's cities and streets,''
he said.
   ``We as an American public don't reach out to help one another
like we used to,'' said Mayor Sue Myrick of Charlotte, N.C. ``We
don't share like we used to. We've become a very selfish nation.''
   Flynn and Myrick are co-chairs of the conference's Task Force on
Hunger and Homelessness.
   Thirteen of the 30 cities surveyed reported negative changes in
public attitudes toward the homeless, and another seven said
changes were both good and bad. ``People are tired of the fact that
the problem remains,'' said officials in Saint Paul. ``In a recent
survey of local needs, homelessness was noted by just one percent
of the tally,'' Portland reported.
   Nine cities said they had taken actions to limit the access of
the homeless to public areas. New York recently banned panhandling
in its subways because of frequent complaints from passengers.
   Peter Smith, president of Partnership for the Homeless, a
nationwide private shelter network, said that while individual
contributions to help the homeless are increasing, he agreed with
the mayors that ``substantial parts of the general public have lost
patience'' with the failure of the public sector to address the
problem.
   Smith said his group, which has estimated the nationwide
homeless population at 2 million, is urging churches, synagogues,
public facilities and private office buildings to open their doors
to the homeless during the holiday season.
   Among the findings:
   -Thirteen cities said emergency food facilities can't meet
demand. Requests for food can't be met 14 percent of the time.
Three-fourths of the cities said people relied on emergency rations
as a steady source of food.
   ``Most food banks are able to supply only enough food to last a
family for one to two days. Even with other sources of income and
support, this is not sufficient to provide an adequate amount of
food,'' Seattle officials said.
   -Soup kitchens in 86 percent of the cities must on occasion turn
people away. ``Some sites are having to close down for several days
a month when food supplies run out,'' according to Cleveland
officials.
   -Shelters in 70 percent of the cities must turn away homeless
families. Nineteen perent of requests go unmet. The average
increase in requests for shelter was 24 percent, ranging from 142
percent in Charleston, which was hit be Hurricane Hugo, to 50
percent in Charlotte and between 5 and 10 percent in Chicago,
Louisville, Phoenix and Saint Paul.
   -Single men comprised 51 percent of the homeless, families with
children make up 34 percent and single women 12 percent. The cities
reported that 46 percent of the homeless population is black, 34
percent is white, 15 percent is Hispanic, 3 percent is Native
American and 1 percent is Asian.
   -People considered mentally ill account for 28 percent of the
homeless. Substance abusers make up 38 percent and 6 percent were
reported to have AIDS or HIV-related illness.
   Flynn noted that the number of people in state mental
institutions dropped from 505,000 in 1955 to less than 118,000
today, and that many of these people, with no place to go, ``were
sentenced to America's streets, grates, doorways and park
benches.''
   He said the federal budget for subsidized low-income housing has
trickled down to almost nothing over the past decade, another
reason more people are without homes.
   ``The Federal government has walked away, now with the states'
downturn in their economies they are walking away, so the cities
are getting a double-whammy... the cities are dealing with the
problem alone.''
   ``We haven't dealt with the basic social problems in this
country for a long time,'' Myrick said. ``Anything we do in putting
money into homeless shelters is a band-aid approach.''
   Eighty-seven percent of the cities used locally generated
revenues to finance aid to the homeless, ranging from $26,000 in
New Orleans to $131 million in New York. All accepted federal funds
from the McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, going from $23,000 in
San Juan to $36 million in New York.

   Authorities began trials Wednesday for a
prominent labor leader and dozens of other suspects arrested in
riots that broke out during a general strike last week.
   The labor official, Mohamed Titna Alaoui, regional secretary in
Fez for the General Union of Moroccan Workers, could face a
five-year prison. He is charged with inciting rebellion and
spreading false information. Lawyers from three human rights groups
are representing him.
   Rioting broke out in Fez and other cities on Friday during a
one-day, nationwide general strike for higher wages. The strike was
called by Alaoui's federation and another labor group.
   The government says five people were killed, but unions and
human rights activists put the death toll at more than 30. One of
the charges against Alaoui is that he gave exaggerated information
about the number of deaths.
   About 200 people were arrested in Fez during the riots, and
officials said 52 of them would appear in court this week. Dozens
more have begun appearing in court in Rabat and Tangier, where
disturbances also took place.
   On Monday, Prime Minister Azzedine Laraki proposed that the
rioting be investigated by a commission of executive branch
officials and lawmakers from various parties. The opposition has
rejected the plan, saying the commission should be completely
independent of the executive branch.
   The severity of the rioting has been widely attributed to
poverty in Morocco's cities. Many rioters were young people who,
according to opposition leaders, are frustrated by the lack of job
opportunities.

   The military establishment has been shaken by a
widening investigation into the Israeli air force involving
millions of dollars in suspected graft from purchases of U.S.
military equipment.
   Brig. Gen. Rami Dotan, once in charge of Israel's military
purchases in the United States, and an air force colonel already
are under arrest. News reports Wednesday said more arrests were
expected.
   Leading officers appeared Wednesday on Israel television to
discuss the case, which involves suspected bribes and diversion of
equipment. They called it a crushing blow to the military's elite
air corps, which is regarded as the first line of defense for
Israel.
   Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron said the charges, if true,
amounted to treason. He pledged a thorough investigation, adding:
``We shall go until the end and cleanse this dirt from out midst.''
   Ezer Weizman, a former defense minister and air force chief,
said that if the charges were true, Dotan had harmed national
security. It is ``as though 100 planes had been shot down,''
Weizman said in interviews with Israel television and radio.
   Dotan, one of the highest-ranking officers ever questioned in a
weapons scandal, was arrested in October and resigned as air force
chief of logistics.
   As is normal under the Israeli justice system, no charges have
been brought because the investigation against him is not complete.
   But public anger over the alleged corruption heightened this
week with news reports that a plea bargain was in the works that
could limit full disclosure of the corruption. Two leading
newspapers argued in editorials against any such deal.
   The military spokesman's office declined comment on the case.
   The allegations against Dotan follow several cases of
ex-officers or reserve officers playing a role in illegal arms
deals.
   Reserve army Lt. Col. Yair Klein was convicted last month of
illegally selling arms and military expertise in Colombia. Klein
claims he was helping farmers fight left-wing rebels, but the
Colombian government has charged he armed and trained drug
traffickers.
   One accusation against Dotan is that he swindled the air force
out of money and equipment, according to Israel television.
Millions of dollars worth of spare parts and equipment recenlt
purchased by the force never reached their destination, the
television said.
   Since his arrest, Dotan has been questioned about pocketing up
to $10 million in bribes in procuring air force equipment in the
United States, newspapers have reported.
   Much of the alleged fraud was committed while Dotan headed the
Defense Ministry's acquisition delegation in New York in 1984-1985,
the reports said.
   The Yedioth Ahronoth daily said the Romanian-born Dotan is an
expert on fighter jet engines and also was involved in a recent
decision in choosing between two well-known American companies to
supply engines for U.S.-made F-16 jets.
   On Tuesday, a colonel in Dotan's unit, not formally identified
in public documents, was arrested and ordered held on suspicion he
received ``privileges'' from Dotan in exchange for keeping quiet
about the alleged fraud, news reports said.
   Dozens of others were being questioned and more arrests were
expected, the reports added.
   Israeli media also said it was suspected that Dotan plotted to
attack another Israeli who informed on the racketeering to police
last summer.
   Yedioth quoted an unidentified sergeant as saying Dotan offered
to pay him $50,000 to ``silence'' Ofer Pa'il, a former employee of
the Defense Ministry acquisitions office in New York.
   Military analyst Ron Ben-Ishai wrote in Yedioth that the
military was uneasy about the scandal's possible effect on U.S.
military aid of $1.8 billion a year, a large chunk of which goes to
the air force.

   Most government workers showed up at
their jobs but refused to work Wednesday in a strike over living
conditions in this Himalayan kingdom, a labor spokesman said.
   More than 100,000 of Nepal's estimated 127,000 employees wore
black arm bands and participated in the strike, the spokesman said
on condition of anonymity. He said the strikers spent most of the
day basking in the sun.
   They are striking to demand better transportation, housing and
education for their children. The spokesman for the Civil Servants'
Association said the protests will continue until the government
fulfills the demands.
   Government officials said they had begun a dialogue with the
strikers to address their grievances.
   Hospitals, telecommunications and other essential services were
excluded from the strike. The labor spokesman said the strike was
peaceful.

ordered a company to pay back wages to 16 people who portrayed
Santa Claus and Santa's helpers during last year's Christmas
season.
   Ciresi &amp; Associates of Newbury, Ohio, hired people to work in
malls across upstate New York last year, said Doug Myers,
department spokesman.
   ``It's simply shameful that Santa and his helpers can bring such
joy to so many New Yorkers and end up with nothing more valuable
than lumps of coal in their stockings,'' Myers said.
   Myers said Ciresi &amp; Associates was ordered to pay $4,821.92 in
back wages and fined $850.
   But labor officials have to find the company first. Letters sent
to its last known address have been returned unopened, Myers said,
and it was not listed in the Newbury telephone directory Wednesday.
   There's no evidence the company is hiring Santas to work in New
York this Christmas season, he said.

   The pilot of a paddle-wheel cruise boat
deliberately ran his craft aground in a sheltering cove after being
caught in a raging storm on Lake Tahoe, and 82 passengers had to be
evacuated.
   No major injuries were reported, but many passengers suffered
severe seasickness.
   The Tahoe Queen stern-wheeler was on its way back from a dinner
cruise Tuesday night when the storm struck. Nearby Reno had wind
gusts to 65 mph.
   The pilot, Dave Clark, managed to steer the craft to Bitler's
Pier, a sandy area near Round Hill on the lake's south shore, near
its normal docking area at a marina, said Tim Smith, Douglas-Tahoe
Fire Department battalion chief.
   ``The bow was beached purposely,'' Smith said. ``He (Clark) did
a remarkable job.''
   ``A couple hundred yards north of where they were and they would
have been pushed in on rocks,'' Smith said. ``It's anybody's guess
what would have happened then.''
   Smith said the waves were the worst he's seen in 18 years.
   ``It was just like being on the ocean,'' he said. ``The weather
just took a turn for the worse that just was not predicted.''
   Suzanne Nielsen, general manager of the Tahoe Queen, said Clark
is licensed for ocean-going vessels.
   The vessel's gangway was wrenched from the bow, but crew members
and rescue workers managed to secure it from the starboard side to
an outcropping of rocks.
   Smith said rescue workers then extended a ladder from shore, and
the passengers were evacuated one at a time while the boat remained
about 30 feet offshore.

<HEAD>Castro Says Layoffs Will Be Needed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Fidel Castro of Cuba said Wednesday
that layoffs are needed to cope with his government's economic
squeeze, the official Cuban news agency reported.
   For years, Cuba has suffered from a U.S. trade embargo. Now,
bargain-rate Soviet oil supplies are being curtailed, and money to
tap alternate sources is short.
   In an address to more than 350 foreign university students,
Castro referred to the problems in procuring enough oil for his
Caribbean island.
   ``For now we have things arranged, but one has to think about a
more critical era,'' Castro was quoted as saying by Prensa Latina,
monitored in Mexico City.
   ``It would be necessary to reduce labor activity in some plaes,
without failing to assure a salary to the affected workers.''
   The report did not quote the Communist leader as specifying the
number of layoffs he believes will be necessary, nor was any date
given.
   Soviet officials have threatened phased reduction of overall
economic aid to Cuba, which reportedly accounts for $4 billion to
$5 billion a year.
   U.S. sources say a marked decline in Soviet purchases of Cuban
sugar at prices substantially higher than world market levels has
reduced another form of subsidy for Cuba's economy.

<HEAD>FTC OKs Consent Agreement Allowing Roche to Acquire Genentech</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday
approved a Swiss pharmaceutical company's acquisition of a leading
U.S. biotechnology firm but required the Swiss concern to issue
U.S. licenses for its patents for AIDS treatment.
   The commission said acquisition of controlling interest in
Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco, Calif., by Roche Holding
Ltd. might substantially lessen competition in the U.S. market for
CD-4-based therapeutics for the treatment of AIDS.
   It told Roche that for 10 years it must grant U.S. license under
its patents for CD-4-based therapeutics to anyone who requests a
license.
   The vote was 3-1 on a consent agreement that allowed the
acquisition while committing Roche to modifying business
arrangements with other companies.
   Commissioner Deborah K. Owen, dissenting, said there were ``as
yet no firms or products'' in the U.S. market for such drugs and
therefore ``drawing conclusions about competitive performance in
that market in the relatively distant future is speculative at
best.''
   Commissioner Andrew J. Strenio Jr. said he would have preferred
securing relief apart from the consent agreement, but agreed with
the majority that there were sufficient grounds to give final
approval to the consent agreement. Commissioner Roscoe Starek III
did not participate.
   Roche markets many pharmaceutical products in the United States
and conducts extensive research and development in biotechnology.
   The commission said its acquisition of Genentech could also
lessen competition in the world market for vitamin C and in the
U.S. market for therapeutic drugs that treat growth deficiency.
   The commission, which put the agreement on the public record for
comment, also required Roche to either break up Genentech's
partnership with Lubrizol, which has researched and patented a new
vitamin C process, or dispose of the partnership's vitamin C
assets.
   A consent agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not
amount to admission of a law violation.

   About 150 leathernecks from the nation's
oldest Marine post are being sent to the Persian Gulf, the first
time the company has been deployed for a military operation since
1906, the Pentagon said Wednesday.
   ``A'' Company is stationed at the Marine Barracks here, and the
unit's colorful history includes the 1859 capture of
insurrectionist John Brown at Harper's Ferry, W.Va.
   ``A'' Company, composed of about 150 infantrymen, is commanded
by Capt. Bryan P. McCoy, 28, of Papillion, Neb. It's scheduled to
leave Dec. 27 for Camp Lejeune, N.C., to join the 2nd Marine
Division.
   It later will be sent to the gulf area.
   The Barracks was established in 1801. The last time its Marines
were deployed for a military operation was in 1906 when a
detachment was assigned to the expeditionary battalions sent to
Cuba for pacification duty.
   Barracks Marines served in 1837 against the Seminole Indians in
Florida. They also defended the nation's capital in the War of 1812
and served in the war with Mexico and the Spanish-American War.
   In recent years, Barracks Marines have served mainly ceremonial
duties.
   They perform wreath-laying ceremonies at the Tomb of the Unknown
Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery, and they march in the
Sunset Parades held each Tuesday evening during the summer at the
Iwo Jima Memorial.
   The Barracks Marines also provide security for the president's
mountain retreat at Camp David, Md., and serve as guards at White
House arrival ceremonies for foreign dignitaries.
   Capt. Cathy Engels, a public affairs officer at the Barracks,
said the Marines at her post are trained infantrymen. In August,
the unit was officially designated alight infantry battalion;
before that it had a ceremonial status.

<TEXT>
   Hunger, disease, war and years of
economic hardship are ravaging the bodies of Africa's children and
traumatizing their minds, the U.N. Children's Fund said Wednesday.
   While the situation of children in much of the world has
improved, children in Africa have quietly fallen victim, often
fatally, to cuts in social spending and wars in which they are
killed or turned into child killers, the organization said.
   At a ceremony to launch its 1991 report on the State of the
World's Children, the UNICEF director in the Ivory Coast, Malick
Sene, listed statistics he said were ``a scandal'' and challenged
the morality of a world tat allows such horrors. Sene is from
Mali.
   He said Africa is the only continent where social spending has
been cut dramatically, where most children never go to school and
where most people wake daily to the fear of not finding enough
food.
   Africa has the world's highest rate of child deaths from easily
preventable disease and infections - more than one-third of the 15
million deaths each year attributed to such causes. Nearly half the
world's 25 million refugees are African children and their mothers.
   Sene said Africans have done little to combat such new social
phenonena as the large numbers of street children created by
poverty and urban migration, and the deadly AIDS virus that in
Africa affects women and children in equal numbers to male victims.
   ``Most terrifying of all is the situation of children embroiled
in conflicts despite themselves - child soldiers, child killers
(created by) conflicts whose violence will produce incalculable
traumas,'' he said.
   ``What can we say about the particularly sad scandal of refugee
children, for example - scores of thousands just in our region
today. Exploited children, enslaved children, children daily
ravaged by famine and hunger while we talk of human rights for
adults,'' Sene said.
   Such outrages against children pose a moral problem that UNICEF
believes can be solved if developed countries keep their promises
to improve the lives of the world's children using money diverted
from defense spending, he said.
   Sene said UNICEF estimates the $20 billion needed to produce
healthier children by the turn of the century amounts to just 10
days of world expenditure on armies and munitions.
   African governments, particularly the military administrations
that hold sway in West Africa, long have been criticized for
allocating large amounts of their budgets for defense and little
for social services.
   Health and Social Protection Minister Alain Ekra of the Ivory
Coast, one of a handful of civilian governments in the region, said
the health of his relatively wealthy country's children has
deteriorated. Last year, the Ivory Coast cut the ministry's budget
by 30 percent.
   ``The situation of children and women improved rapidly in the
first two decades after our independence (in 1960) thanks to
appreciable efforts by the government,'' he said. ``Unhappily,
because of a runaway birth rate and persistent economic recession,
we are seeing a stagnation, even a deterioration in the
situation.''

<HEAD>Embassy: U.S. Drug Agents Have Resumed Raids in Peru</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   American drug agents have resumed raids on
cocaine traffickers in Peru's jungle despite reported conflicts
with the military, the U.S. Embassy said Wednesday.
   Army sources, meanwhile, denied that soldiers had interfered in
American enforcement operations in the area.
   U.S. DEA agents are attacking ``any target that arises,'' an
embassy spokesman said. Bad weather and vacations for the holidays
are keeping the number of helicopter raids below normal levels, the
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   Drug Enforcement Administation chief Robert Bonner said Tuesday
in Washington that agents had suspended operations in the Upper
Huallaga Valley because of interference by Peruvian armed forces.
   The DEA and Peruvian police operate a helicopter base in the
valley, the world's main source of coca leaf, the raw material for
cocaine. The valley is also a center of operations by Peru's two
leftist rebel groups.
   The Washington Post on Wednesday reported the State Department
is considering removing Peru from the list of countries cooperating
with U.S. anti-drug efforts.
   Removing Peru from the list would require the United States to
cut off most of its aid to Peru. It would also require Washington
to oppose loans to Peru by the International Monetary Fund and
other multinational institutions.
   Presidential and Foreign Ministry officials said Wednesday they
had no comment on Bonner's statements.
   An Interior Ministry spokesman denied the armed forces had ever
interfered with DEA operations. The spokesman said relations
between the army and the anti-drug police are ``normal.''
   The Interior Ministry is in charge of Peruvian police forces.
After taking office July 28, Fujimori appointed active army
officers to most top posts in the ministry.
   An army officer at the Military Joint Command also denied that
soldiers had hindered DEA raids in the Huallaga.
   ``If anything, it is the DEA that is interfering with army
operations in the zone,'' said the officer without elaborating. He
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The United States and Peru's armed forces have often clashed
over anti-drug strategy in the Huallaga.
   Peruvian officers have made clear they regard the guerrillas as
a much greater threat than the drug traffickers. Political violence
the past 10 years has claimed nearly 20,000 lives.
   The military believes anti-drug operations in the valley could
push local peasants into the rebel ranks. Some 200,000 Peruvians
are thought to be involved in growing and processing coca.
   The rebels provide protection to the drug traffickers in
exchange for guns and money, police and peasants in the area say.
   In 1989, U.S. officials accused the army general in charge of
anti-rebel operations in the Huallaga of allowing drug traffickers
to operate in the region. The general was later transferred.
   In September, Fujimori refused to accept $36 million in U.S.
military aid to fight drug trafficking. He said Peru needs more
economic aid to help the peasants who grow coca leaves.

   NASA scientists pretending to be
explorers from another world said Wednesday they had concluded life
exists on Earth, and it may be intelligent.
   The scientists based their conclusinon on data from the
Jupiter-bound Galileo spacecraft.
   ``The accumulated evidence we have ... would give your
hypothetical explorer a very strong indication you had biological
activity on Earth,'' said Torrence Johnson, Galileo's chief
scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Galileo's study of Earth illustrates how researchers use data
collected by spacecraft to reach conclusions about other planets.
   Galileo boomeranged past Earth and the moon Dec. 8, using the
planet's gravity as a slingshot to speed it up and expand its orbit
around the sun so it can reach Jupiter in 1995.
   Scientists used the opportunity to treat Earth as an alien
planet, ordering Galileo to snap a few thousand pictures and make
numerous measurements. They outlined their findings during a
Wednesday news conference.
   Measurements made by Galileo's infrared light-detecting
instrument showed Earth's atmosphere is rich in nitrous oxide,
methane and oxygen, indicating ``there's a lot of life'' on the
planet, said laboratory scientist Robert W. Carlson.
   Another of Galileo's instruments picked up non-natural radio
signals that got stronger closer to the planet, which would make
alien scientists strongly suspect Earth has intelligent life that
makes radio broadcasts, Johnson said.
   The spaceship also detected lightning bolts, made measurements
to help explain creation of the Northern and Southern Lights,
determined the planet is warmed by a mild ``greenhouse effect'' and
detected a high-altitude ice cloud that helps cause the annual hole
in the protective ozone layer over Antarctica.
   On the moon, Galileo found evidence of a huge volcanic eruption
4 billion years ago. That shows such volcanic activity occurred
about 200 million years earlier than previously believed, said
Brown University geologist Jim Head.
   The spacecraft's pictures also confirmed the existence of a
1,200-mile-wide meteorite impact basin on the southern hemisphere
of the moon's far side, the largest such crater ever identified,
Head said.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration released nine
more of Galileo's photos of the Earth and moon Wednesday.
   One was a mosaic, assembled from 11 separate pictures, showing
all of icy Antarctica. Others showed huge lunar craters, a color
map of minerals on the moon's surface, clouds swirling over South
America, and Australia's larger lakes and Great Barrier Reef.
   The pictures didn't display evidence of life on Earth because
Galileo's closest approach to the planet, at a distance of 597
miles, was over the southwest Atlantic Ocean. The detail in the
pictures was inadequate to reveal buildings, scientists said.
   NASA also displayed two short movies, made by assembling
hundreds of Galileo's still photos, showing the Earth and moon
spinning.
   ``Top that, Ted Turner!'' Head declared after the colorized
lunar movie was played. He was referring to media mogul Turner's
controversial practice of colorizing classic films.
   Also Wednesday, Galileo fired its thrusters repeatedly to aim
itself properly for its close encounter with the asteroid Gaspra
next Oct. 29, said project manager Bill O'Neil.
   Galileo will swing past Earth again Dec. 8, 1992, for a final
``gravity slingshot'' maneuver to help it reach Jupiter. In July
1995, Galileo will separate into an orbiter and a probe. Both will
reach Jupiter in December 1995.
   The probe will descend into Jupiter's atmosphere, returning data
to the orbiter until the probe is crushed by intense atmospheric
pressure. The orbiter will circle Jupiter for at least two years,
studying the planet and making closeup pictures of its 10 largest
moons.

   NASA has lost the glamour that once attracted
top people to its ranks and the agency is now not competitive with
industry and academia in hiring of the best and brightest,
according to a federal report released Wednesday.
   ``Contrary to the popular saying, at NASA you do have to be a
rocket scientist to fill many of its demanding positions,'' said
the final, full report of the Advisory Committee on the Future of
the U.S. Space Program.
   The study said that the excitement of working for NASA has faded
and that the space agency in its hiring now is ``not competitive
for experienced engineers and senior technically-qualified
managers.''
   But to get such people, NASA now loses out to world-class
industrial and academic institutions seeking the same sort of
talent, the report said.
   ``In the past, the challenge and excitement of the space program
has been a significant inducement for exactly the type of people
one wishes to attract,'' said the report. Recently, however, it
said, criticism of the space program and its participants, and the
image of public service in general, have made NASA a less
attractive employer.
   Because of these problems, the committee said it was not
confident ``that in the future NASA will be able to obtain or
retain the necessary cadre of skilled personnel in a field where
the most critical asset is the talent of the individual
participants.''
   The 12-member advisory committee was appointed four months ago
to study the civil space program and to make recommendations to
Vice President Dan Quayle and to NASA Administrator Richard Truly.
A summary of the report was released last week; the full report was
issued Wednesday.
   To help NASA attract special skills, the committee called for
reforms in civil service regulations that would allow the agency to
pay higher salaries for specific skills and to give more
flexibility in establishing pay schedules in certain circumstances.
   Among the other recommendations of the committee were:
   -Reduce reliance on the space shuttle and the development of
new, unmanned launch vehicles to put satellites and other equipment
into orbit.
   -Redesign Space Station Freedom with a goal of reducing costs
and complexity. The space station mission, the committee said,
should center on life sciences and human space operations and less
on industrial process research.
   -Science should be given the highest priority in the space
program and science activities should be maintained at or above 20
percent of the NASA budget.
   -NASA should not build a fifth space shuttle, but keep the fleet
at four after the new orbiter, Endeavour, is delivered next year.
   -A longterm program should be established to carry out President
Bush's goal of establishing a permanent base on the moon and the
human exploration of the planet Mars, along with an effort ``to
produce significant advances in space transportation and life
sciences.''
   Bush has said he wanted the Mars landing by 2019, but the
committee said the schedule should be designed to match the
availability of federal funds.
   -A project to study the planet Earth from orbit should be
initiated and continued over several decades ``rather than a
mission whose design is frozen in time.''

   Opposition leaders met Wednesday with
President Ion Iliescu to discuss demands for a new broad-based
Cabinet as strikes and protests continued against the government.
   Several thousand anti-government demonstrators rallied in
Timisoara, 280 miles northwest of Bucharest, where they have been
protesting all week. It was in Timisoara one year ago that the
country's popular revolution began.
   In Bucharest, several hundred students demonstrated outside the
state television building in support of Dumitru Iuga, head of the
Free TV Union. Iuga has been on a hunger strike for 19 days
demanding the ouster of television executives left over from the
Communist dictatorship.
   All domestic flights were canceled and international flights
were subject to long delays as employees of the state airline Tarom
continued their strike.
   The independent daily Romania Libera said the navigators' union
from the Black Sea port of Constanta called for a general strike as
a ``sign of solidarity'' with students who are boycotting classes.
It did not say when such a strike would begin or if there had been
any positive response from workers.
   In Timisoara, student strikers have been joined by about 50,000
workers from 11 area factories.
   Union leaders in the city said Wednesday that 16 more factories
had joined the warning strike. They did not say how many workers
the factories employed.
   Meanwhile, a delegation from the non-parliamentary opposition
Civic Alliance met with Iliescu to press demands for the formation
of a ``government of national unity.''
   Marian Munteanu, a prominent student leader who was elected
temporary president of the Civic Alliance last week, said he was
``very satisfied'' with the talks.
   National Liberal Party leader Radu Campeanu urged the formation
of a unity government in talks with the president last Thursday.
   Campeanu asked Iliescu to replace Premier Petre Roman with ``a
neutral person not affiliated with the National Salvation Front.''
   The Front, which includes former Communist officials, ruled
provisionally until May, when it won free elections. Critics say
the government has failed to resolve the nation's economic woes.
   There has been growing public dissatisfaction with the
government as economic reforms, including price increases, have
taken effect.
   Roman, in line with his program of sweeping economic reform
designed to create a market economy, urged parliament Wednesday to
expedite a law granting farmers and peasants ownership of the land
they cultivate, thus disbanding the state farms set up under
Communist rule.
   The law would give peasants the land they work and the right to
buy more. However, no one would be permitted to own more than 250
acres.
   Last year's revolution ousted dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who
was executed on Christmas Day along with his wife, Elena.

   The Arctic Express roared into the northern Plains on Wednesday,
bringing icy wind chills and snow.
   At midday, Kalispell was the warmest spot in Montana at 5 below
zero. Great Falls reported 22 below. The low temperatures combined
with brisk wind to produce wind chill factors as low as 77 below
zero at Dillon, in the state's southwestern corner.
   Wind chills ranged from 40 below to 60 below zero across a large
portion of North Dakota, 50 to 60 below zero across South Dakota,
50 to 65 below across Idaho and 40 to 45 below over much of
Nebraska.
   Blizzard conditions were expected into Thursday over the
Tehachapi mountains of central California, as well as the eastern
slopes of the central Sierra of Nevada.
   Rain extended across the Florida panhandle, southern Alabama and
southwest Georgia. Rain was scattered over the central half of the
California coast into central California.
   Freezing rain in southeastern Nebraska changed to light rain
over northwest Missouri and southwest Iowa and back to freezing
rain over east central Iowa.
   Snow fell over northern Illinois, southern Wisconsin, central
Upper Michigan, northwest Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, South
Dakota and much of Nebraska.
   Snow also fell from northwest Kansas, through Wyoming, northern
Utah, northern Nevada, the Idaho panhandle and parts of Oregon into
southeast Washington.
   High temperature records were set in Providence, R.I., at 57
degrees, Daytona Beach, Fla., at 87 and Barrow, Alaska at 27.
   Low temperature records broken included Billings, Mont., 17
below zero, Casper, Wyo., 16 below, and Great Falls, Mont., 25
below.
   Wednesday morning's low temperature for the Lower 48 states was
25 below zero at Great Falls.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 21
below zero at Great Falls to 87 at Bartow, Fla.

<HEAD>Man Won't Be Prosecuted Again in Case Of Woman With 46
Personalities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSHKOSH, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge honored a prosecutor's request and
dismissed charges Wednesday against a man accused of sexually
assaulting a woman with 46 personalities.
   Prosecutor Joseph Paulus said he asked that charges against Mark
Peterson be dismissed after consulting with multiple personality
experts and determining a retrial would be harmful to the victim.
   Circuit Judge Robert Hawley overturned Peterson's Nov. 8
conviction on sexual assault charges earlier this week because the
defense had not been allowed to have a psychiatrist examine the
woman before trial.
   Paulus, whose handling of the case has been widely criticized,
said even though he won't reprosecute Peterson he was satisfied
justice was done.
   ``The jury verdict, although now set aside on a legal
technicality, sent a strong message to the community that mentally
ill individuals in our society must be protected from those who
prey upon them,'' he said.
   The lawyer for the 27-year-old woman, who suffers from multiple
personality disorder and has 46 personalities, said his client
wanted another trial to ensure that her attacker went to jail, but
he advised her against it.
   ``Right now, we are trying to get her to a doctor who can give
her some long-term care,'' said the lawyer, George Curtis. ``She
has been able to (get) only some free treatment that is available
through government and it is infrequent.''
   Hawley accepted the prosecutor's recommendation and dismissed
the charge of second-degree sexual assault against Peterson, 29, of
Oshkosh.
   The decision clears Peterson, an ex-grocery store bagger, of any
criminal wrongdoing in taking the woman out on a coffee date and
having sex with her June 11 in his car two days after they met.
   It is a crime in Wisconsin for someone to have sex with a
mentally ill person who cannot understand the consequences of their
actions. The perpetrator must also know the person is mentally ill.
   In convicting Peterson, the jury accepted Paulus' arguments that
Peterson knew of the woman's mental illness and manipulated one of
her personalities to have sex with her.
   Peterson would not comment after Wednesday's dismissal of the
charge. His attorney, Mary Lou Robinson, called on Paulus to
publicly apologize for bringing the case to trial.
   Paulus said the prosecution of the case was legitimate and
claimed Ms. Robinson was trying to exploit the situation for
Peterson's gain.
   The trial, in which the woman testified as six different
personalities, attracted international attention and raised new
questions about sexual consent and mental illness.
   Curtis, the woman's lawyer, said the stress and publicity
surrounding the trial has caused his client's mental illness to
worsen.
   Since the case became public, the victim's personalities have
grown from 18 to 46. Police have been called to her home after she
reported one personality was trying to kill her.

<HEAD>Fed Lowers Another Key Interest Rate as Economy Slumps</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 2nd graf to give magnitude of rate reduction, \ point,
also given in 8th graf</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve, amidst fresh evidence of
a weakening economy, lowered another key interest rate on
Wednesday, analysts said. The Bush administration said it expected
banks to follow the Fed's lead to rejuvenate consumer borrowing,
but there was no rush to do so.
   Economists said the central bank injected reserves into the
banking system to push the federal funds rate - the interest that
banks charge to make loans to each other - down by \ point to 7
percent. A day earlier, the Fed cut its discount rate, the interest
it charges for direct loans to commercial banks, from 7 percent to
6.5 percent, the first reduction in four years.
   The Fed's action came as the Commerce Department lowered its
already low estimate of the economy's pace in the July-September
quarter, putting the annual rate of growth in the gross national
product at an anemic 1.4 percent.
   Analysts said the downward revision in the GNP report showed
that the country was facing severe difficulty even before the
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait battered the economy with soaring energy
prices.
   Many economists were looking for the fourth quarter GNP report
to signal the start of a recession, with some guessing that the
contraction of output during the period could be as sharp as a 3.5
percent drop in GNP at an annual rate.
   They base that estimate on a torrent of dismal economic news
during the period from rising unemployment to falling industrial
production and weak consumer sales.
   It is these statistics that are prompting to the Fed to
aggressively ease interest rates in the hopes that lower borrowing
costs will spur such interest-rate sensitive sectors of the economy
as housing and car sales.
   Economists said that the reduction in the funds rate engineered
- but not publicly confirmed - by the Fed on Wednesday amounted to
only a 0.25 percentage point cut. It would be the fourth
quarter-point cut in the funds rate that the Fed has spurred in the
past two months.
   On Wednesday, the Fed cut its discount rate, the interest it
charges to make direct loans to commercial banks, from 7 percent to
6.5 percent.
   While a cut in the discount rate is the most dramatic signal
that the central bank can send of its desire to fight a slumping
economy with lower interest rates, changes in the funds rate are
considered just as crucial because of the impact they have on
banks' cost of funds.
   Normally, the credit easing moves the Fed has made would be
enough to spur banks to slash their benchmark prime lending rate,
which is used as the basis for calculating many consumer and
business loans.
   However, the country's major banks, who have been facing severe
losses on bad real estate loans this year, showed no move toward
making such a cut Wednesday although analysts said they still
expected a reduction within days. The prime lending rate has been
stuck at 10 percent since last January.
   The Bush administration let it be known that it expected banks
to do their part to spur a flagging economy. Presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said that while a reduction in the prime rate was
a ``market decision'' it was normal that ``a discount-rate cut
reverberates through the system.''
   The Commerce Department GNP report continued to revise downward
economic growth for the third quarter. It initially estimated
growth during this period at 1.8 percent in October, but revised
that to 1.7 percent a month later.
   The GNP is the nation's total output of goods and services and
its broadest measure of economic health.
   Economist Kermit Baker of Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass.,
said the downward revision ``is a trajectory of where the economy
is headed. It indicates the fourth quarter will be a lot weaker
than the third.''
   Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
in New York, agreed, noting other government reports show ``the
economy is falling rather rapidly in the fourth quarter'' and will
continue to fall during the first part of 1991.
   Highlighting the continuing deterioration, the department also
reported on Wednesday that construction of single-family houses in
November dropped to a level not seen since the 1981-82 recession
even though the overall construction figure rose by 9.3 percent,
solely because of a big increase in multi-family building.
   The government reported Wednesday that a GNP measure of
inflation was unchanged at an annual rate of 4.2 percent in the
third quarter. That measure was expected to rise significantly
faster in the final three months of the year given what energy
prices did following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Contributing most to the downward revision in third-quarter GNP
growth was weaker consumer spending and a wider trade deficit than
first estimated.
   Consumer spending was revised from a 3.6 percent annual rate of
growth to just 2.7 percent while the nation's trade deficit
increase was boosted to $1.9 billion, more than three times higher
than last month's estimate.

   The earthquake a week ago destroyed part of a town, Carlentini,
where 12 people were crushed to death. Five others suffered fatal

   Alvaro Gomez y Paloma, a prefect overseeing aid for victims,
said Wednesday that 10,026 people had been forced to leave their

   More than 1,000 are living in tents set up by security forces.
Authorities have found quarters in undamaged buildings for nearly
3,000 others. The rest are staying with relatives or friends.
   A series of very minor shocks rattled the area again Wednesday
evening.

<HEAD>Low-Key Christmas for Expatriates in Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN MARRIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christmas doesn't seem much like a season
of goodwill and peace for the dwindling band of Christian civilians
in Persian Gulf countries close to the Kuwait crisis zone.
   A children's choir delighted audiences in Manama with
traditional carols, but their conductor had to keep whispering
``smile, smile'' to the grim-faced kids as they sang:
   ``Dear Father Christmas we want you to know
   ``We'd like to build a snowman but we haven't any snow
   ``We want just a little, enough for one day
   ``And when we've built our snowman you can take the rest away.''
   It was appropriate for Bahrain's balmy winter, where snow is
seen only on Christmas cards or in movies.
   The children may now see the real stuff earlier than they
thought.
   Many Western expatriate workers are sending their families to
Europe or North America for Christmas and few of the families
expect to come back soon.
   Many bought air tickets weeks ago but hadn't decided whether to
use them.
   Now, with Britain advising British dependents to quit Bahrain,
Qatar, eastern Saudi Arabia, Riyadh and Tabuk, most are likely to
leave.
   Some other Westerners in Bahrain will take their cue from their
departure, since the estimatd 4,500 Britons make up the largest
Western expatriate community here.
   Half the island's 500,000 residents are expatriates, with the
bulk of them from Asian countries.
   Washington is not advising the 750 U.S. citizens in Bahrain to
leave. It told them the island would be well protected in event of
hostilities, and Americans would be helped if in danger.
   The departures make it harder for the Western families
remaining. Schools tailored to the foreign communities lose
teachers and some shut down.
   Putting dampening the holiday spirit was the Bahrain
government's decision to cancel celebrations on the Dec. 16
national day, citing the crisis following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   In the past, glittering streamers of electric lights put up for
national day stayed up until the Christian season ended. This year
- no lights.
   Conductor Richard Chalkley told the adult choir at the dress
rehearsal for the Manama Singers annual Christmas concert they
should try to look more upbeat.
   ``Try to smile a little bit,'' he urged.
   It wasn't easy. The choir is down to 80 singers, from more than
100, and now their Filipino pianist says she'll probably go home,
too.
   The remaining members fear they may lose more singers as the
Jan. 15 U.N. deadline approaches for Iraq to leave Kuwait. That's
also the date for the first rehearsal of the choir's New Year
season.
   The swelling ranks of Western military personnel are being
showered with gifts and attention from back home as Dec. 25
approaches.
   When the choir toured Manama's hotels singing carols, it was
joined by servicemen in crewcuts who helped belt out Christmas
favorites.
   In one hotel, almost the entire audience was made up of puzzled
Kuwaiti exiles in long white robes. Their quizzical expressions
dissolved after a rousing rendition of ``Rudolph The Red-Nosed
Reindeer.''
   Bahrain has a more relaxed attitude toward the Christian
festivities than neighboring Saudi Arabia, where hundreds of
thousands of Western troops are deployed.
   Pine trees bearing Christmas ornaments adorn Manama hotel
lobbies and offices.
   Christmas music is played on Bahrain radio.
   The only restriction formerly was a tacit ban on use of the word
``Christmas.'' The term has been coming into the open lately,
splashed across posters in hotels.
   Christmas cards are openly on sale, but some bear distinctly
unpeaceful messages this year. One shows Santa with his sleigh team
in the desert, with a row of tanks in the background.
   Most of the customers at shopping centers seem to be off-duty
troops. One gift displayed in stores is a T-shirt with the words:
``I Survived Bahrain 1990.''

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand said Wednesday that a
peaceful settlement of the Persian Gulf crisis is still possible
and France ``isn't prohibited from taking initiatives'' to avoid
war.
   But he told a news conference that if Iraq's intransigence makes
war inevitable, ``France will not fail to fulfill its historic
duty.''
   He said France would participate if military action was launched
against Iraqi forces in accordance with U.N. Security Council
resolutions. But he said France had no plans to increase its force
in Saudi Arabia beyond the nearly 10,000 troops now there or en
route.
   Mitterrand expressed regret at the U.S. opposition to a proposed
Security Council resolution that would endorse the concept of an
international conference on Middle East problems, including the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
   ``We're not fixing the date for next week.'' Mitterrand said.
``But we think a conference would be an indispensable means of
reconciling peoples.''
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has said a settlement of the
Palestinian situation might prompt him to make concessions
regarding Kuwait, which his troops have occupied since Aug. 2.
   Mitterrand suggested the proposed U.S.-Iraqi talks were doomed
because of a dispute over dates. If it becomes definite that these
talks will not occur, he said, France might take an initiative
along with its European allies.
   ``Until the deadline, one must hope that dialogues can take
place here and there,'' he said. ``France, in the open, not acting
in silence but in conformity with the U.N.'s objectives and in
consultation with its Western partners, is not prohibited from
taking initiatives of this type.''
   Before Jan. 15, the Security Council's deadline for Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait, ``many things are possible,'' Mitterrand
said. ``It's not forbidden to hope.''
   However, Mitterrand reiterated French's support for the Security
Council's demand that Iraq withdraw unilaterally and totally. Any
partial withdrawal would not be sufficient, he said.
   ``Time is passing,'' he said. ``The leaders of Iraq, and
particularly the president, must have a clear awareness of the
risks they are running.''

   Former President Daniel Ortega said
Wednesday he helped persuade President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to
free remaining Western hostages to reduce the likelihood of a
U.S.-led attack.
   Ortega returned to Nicaragua on Dec. 16 from a 34-day tour of
the Mideast. During his trip, he traveled twice to Baghdad, the
Iraqi capital, where he met with Saddam.
   Before leaving, Ortega met with U.S. Ambassador Harry Shlaudeman
and a veteran Mideast official from the State Department, a
top-level source within Ortega's leftist Sandinista Front told The
Associated Press.
   The source said the U.S. officials did not send Saddam any
messages, but simply explained Washington's position on the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   A longtime Sandinista militant told The Associated Press that
Ortega, who lost Feb. 25 elections to Violeta Chamorro, is seeking
to revive his image as a statesman. The militant said it is likely
Ortega will run in Nicaragua's 1996 elections.
   In private conversations, the militant also said Ortega is
trying to drum up financial support for the Sandinistas from Libyan
leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
   In an interview, Ortega said Wednesday that although Iraqi
officials favor a peaceful solution in the gulf, ``they have
committed themselves so much in this situation, with such polarized
positions, that it is hard for them to take the first step.
   ``In that sense, our actions are aimed ... so that they search
for the solution within the framework of the Security Council
resolution,'' Ortega said. ``What we're doing is facilitating that
peaceful solution.''
   The U.N. Security Council has authorized Iraq's opponents to use
force if Iraq fails to leave Kuwait by Jan. 15.
   Ortega said that when he met Saddam and Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz, he broached the subject of releasing the hostages
before Christmas.
   ``We told him that it was a very sensitive theme, a theme that
was being exploited in favor of war in the zone, and that the most
convenient thing was to seek a way to exit totally that
situation,'' Ortega said.
   ``In other words, we made the presentation, and he said he would
seek a way to act on that.''
   Ortega said while he was in Bonn, Germany, on Dec. 5, Iraq's
ambassador to that country approached him with a message from
Hussein.
   ``The message was that within the next few hours, he would
release all the foreigners,'' Ortega said.
   The next day, Saddam announced his intention to free all
remaining foreigners.

   American parents should be able to
decide what schools their children attend, President Bush's choice
for education secretary said Wednesday.
   Government doesn't tell Americans what kind of cars to buy or
where to do their shopping, so why should they be told where their
children must attend school, University of Tennessee President
Lamar Alexander told a group of Chattanooga News-Free Press
editors.
   ``I don't know how we drifted into telling parents what school
their child should attend. This is America. They ought to be able
to decide for themselves,'' Alexander said.
   Alexander, a former two-term Tennessee governor, would not talk
about what his policies would be as education secretary before his
Senate confirmation hearings next month, but he said he doesn't
believe he has sharp differences with Bush.
   ``In my other positions, I have been elected, so I set policy.
In this job, he sets the policy. I know President Bush genuinely
wants to be the education president, but he doesn't have a lot of
time to do it,'' Alexander said.
   Alexander was appointed president of the university in July
1988.
   He was nominated Monday to succeed Education Secretary Lauro
Cavazos.

   The worst outbreak of St. Louis
encephalitis in Florida since 1962 is over, state health officials
said Wednesday. Nine people died from the disease.
   The onset of cooler weather cut the numbers of mosquitos that
carry the disease, leading the state Department of Health and
Rehabilitative Services to pronounce the end of the outbreak.
   ``We just haven't had any cases in four weeks. The mosquito
count is nil. So it was the right time to call it off,'' said
health agency spokesman David Adams.
   In addition to the deaths, 202 people were infected with the
virus and thousands more were forced to curtail nighttime
activities ranging from high school football to Halloween
trick-or-treat.
   The encephalitis outbreak also frightened tourists and put a
scare into merchants worried about its impact on the economy. Cases
were reported in 27 counties on both coasts stretching from
Jacksonville to Miami.
   State health officials said outbreaks of St. Louis encephalitis
run in cycles of five to 10 years, with only about five cases
reported during a normal year. In the 1962 outbreak, 222 cases were
reported.
   The outbreaks are tied to increases in the population of the
culex nigrapalpus mosquito, which draws the disease from the blood
of migrating birds. The viral infection causes inflammation of the
brain.
   The average age of victims in the latest outbreak was 52, and
only 5 percent involved children under age 11. The youngest person
to die was 58.
   The most cases were reported in Orange County, home of Walt
Disney World, with 27.

<TEXT>
   Turkey, the only NATO nation bordering
Iraq, has asked the Western alliance for air units to bolster its
frontier before the Jan. 15 deadline for Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait, sources said Wednesday.
   The request for the units has to be approved by defense
officials of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization before they
could be deployed.
   But a NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that so far there has been no opposition to the request. ``So it's
not a big problem,'' he said.
   The requested units are from the Allied Command Europe Mobile
Force, a mobile multinational force armed with conventional
weapons, said a senior NATO source.
   Set up in 1960, it is designed to be sent at short notice to any
threatened part of the European command and primarily to reduce the
vulnerability of the alliance's flank regions.
   Turkey has asked for a force comprising 5,000 men to be in place
on its southeastern border with Iraq by Jan. 15, said the source,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   That is the deadline set by the U.N. Security Council for Iraq
to unconditionally withdraw from Kuwait or face military action.
   The NATO mobile force has both land and air forces, and can be
deployed within a week on direct orders of the defense ministers of
the 16 alliance nations. It can draw troops from a number of
members, including the United States, Britain, the Netherlands,
Canada and Germany.
   Turkey's armed forces of 800,000 troops are the second largest
in the NATO alliance after the United States. About 100,000 troops
are along its border with Iraq.
   Turkish newspapers reported the government requested the NATO
units last week.
   The reports said it was the first time Turkey had asked NATO for
such a force to strengthen its own armies on the alliance's
southeastern flank.
   Turkish Defense Minister Husnu Dogan was quoted by the
newspapers as saying the reports were baseless. ``There's been no
change in our policy in this regard. We have made no such
request,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Murat Sungar, at a weekly briefing
Wednesday, would neither confirm nor deny the accounts.
   Turkey was singled out for support during a meeting of NATO
foreign ministers on Monday and Tuesday at alliance headquarters in
Brussels.
   In a statement, the ministers noted that the Persian Gulf crisis
``poses a potential threat'' to Turkey and reaffirmed their
determination to go to its aid in case of attack.
   ``We reiterate our firm commitment to the security of the entire
southern region, the strategic importance of which is highlighted
by this crisis,'' it said.
   Under NATO's 1949 treaty, member nations agree to defend one
another from armed attack.

   A Japanese professor was named Wednesday
by the U.N. secretary-general as his choice for high commissioner
for refugees, ending a 10-month search that angered some of the
agency's major donors.
   Sadako Ogata, a U.S.-trained professor and specialist in human
rights, was nominated for the U.N. post by Javier Perez de Cuellar,
his office said. The General Assembly is expected to confirm the
choice by acclamation Friday, U.N. officials said.
   Mrs. Ogata, 63, would be responsible for protecting 15 million
refugees worldwide during a three-year term. She would be the first
woman to hold the post that has traditionally gone to Western men,
including many high-profile politicians and fund-raisers.
   The search for a new high commissioner has been clouded by
allegations of favoritism and highhandedness by U.N. officials.
Some member states, especially Western nations that are major
donors of refugee aid, said they were not sufficiently consulted.
   The secretary-general has denied the charges.
   The controversy broke out in November, when it appeared that the
secretary-general was about to nominate Virendra Dayal, an Indian
who is his closest aide. After the complaints by Western nations,
Dayal withdrew his nomination, but angrily denounced his opponents
and suggested they are racist.
   U.N. officials said her nomination marks the beginning of a new
era of sensitivity to naming women to high U.N. posts and the end
of domination of the refugee post by Western European men.
   Her selection also recognizes Japan's formidable role in the
world economy and its contribution to U.N. peacekeeping and

Japan's Development Bank.
   Mrs. Ogata is dean of the faculty of foreign studies at Sophia
University in Tokyo and professor at the Institute of International
Relations for Advanced Studies on Peace and Development in Asia at
the university.
   She became Japan's first woman minister to the United Nations in
1976, and she served as chairman of the Executive Board of the U.N.
Childrens Fund from 1978-79. In those years, she was also Japan's
special U.N. envoy.
   Mrs. Ogata is the independent expert of the U.N. Commission on
Human Rights for Burma. From 1982-85, she was Japan's expert on the
U.N. Commission on Human Rights.
   She received a doctoral degree in political science from the
University of California at Berkeley in 1963.
   Mrs. Ogata will replace Thorvald Stoltenberg, who recently
resigned to become deputy prime minister of Norway.
   When his withdrew his nomination in November, Dayal challenged
the motives of the nations that opposed him.
   ``It's a feeling that you have to be a Western European to do a
job of integrity,'' he told a news conference. ``It's a feeling
that a Western European has to carry the burden of the white man.''
   The last high commissioner, Stoltenberg, replaced Jean-Pierre
Hocke, who resigned in October 1989. Hocke left under a cloud when
it was disclosed that he had used a special education fund over a
period of years to upgrade his airline travel to first class.

   Gov.-elect Lawton Chiles, rushing back
to the capital for a news conference Wednesday, got a speeding
ticket in Georgia for driving 80 mph in a 50 mph zone, authorities
said.
   Chiles, driving alone in a red sedan, was pulled over by two
Bainbridge police officers and issued a $70 ticket, said Police
Chief Larry Funderburke.
   Funderburke said Chiles can avoid a Feb. 4 court date by paying

   An apologetic Chiles said that's exactly what he intends to do.
   ``I just didn't realize how fast I was going. I was thinking
about getting back,'' he said.
   Chiles said he was in Georgia hunting quail north of Bainbridge
with U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, a longtime friend. He was returning for a
news conference to announce his choice for secretary of the
Department of Labor and Employment Security, Frank Scruggs.
   Chiles said the officers didn't recognize him or know his name.
He said he was given a breathalyzer test that showed he had zero

   One day after forming a new cable television
comedy channel, Home Box Office and Viacom International on
Wednesday named a Fox, Inc. executive as president of their newborn
Comedy TV service.
   Robert M. Kreek, who has been president of Fox's cable
programming division since August, will start his new job
immediately, even though Comedy TV won't begin operations until
early next year, an HBO spokeswoman said.
   The two companies on Tuesday announced they would merge their
separate 24-hour comedy services - HBO's The Comedy Channel and
Viacom's Ha! - in the jointly-owned, 24-hour Comedy TV service.
   The two comedy networks had been money-losers - about $40
million each, according to one published estimate - since they
began.
   The Comedy Channel started in November, 1989, and Ha! on April
Fool's Day this year. They served a combined total of 15 million
homes that Comedy TV now will inherit.
   Keek, a former HBO executive based in Los Angeles, will relocate
to New York, where Comedy TV will have its headquarters. He will
report to a board that consists of four members each from HBO and
Viacom.

   The announcement reversed a decision the 44-year-old Republican

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Salim Hoss resigned on
Wednesday to make way for a broad-based government that will try to
end 15{ years of civil war.
   But Christian and Moslem militia chieftains expressed
reservations that could undermine peace efforts.
   Hoss, a Sunni Moslem and veteran of Lebanon's turbulent
politics, formed his government on Nov. 25, 1989. He presented the
resignation of his 14-member Cabinet to President Elias Hrawi, a
Maronite Catholic. Hrawi asked Hoss to stay on as caretaer prime
minister.
   The new Cabinet will be charged with drafting a plan to disband
the private armies that have fought each other since 1975. It is
expected to include members from the main warring militias as well
as political parties.
   However, the two strongest militias - Christian chieftain Samir
Geagea's Lebanese Forces and Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's
Progressive Socialist Party - expressed doubts about the plan.
   ``The way the president is dealing with the question of a new
government indicates he might bring in an untidy government that
would stumble upon its first steps,'' Jumblatt's party said. ``This
could create a dangerous power vacuum.''
   Jumblatt, a member of the outgoing Cabinet, has accused Hrawi of
corruption and favoritism. Hrawi's aides accused Jumblatt of
``corrupt deeds'' in his Ministry of Public Works.
   A Lebanese Forces statement said Geagea ``will not take part in
the new Cabinet ... because it looks like it is going to be a tower
of Babel.''
   It said the new Cabinet would require a statesman at the helm
``with the political experience and economic know-how as well as
the honesty of Prime Minister Hoss.''
   Hoss, 61, a U.S.-educated banker turned politician, said before
resigning that he would not accept a new term. He has headed four
cabinets since 1976.
   Lebanon's media predict outgoing Education Minister Omar Karami
will become prime minister. The 55-year-old lawyer, also a Sunni,
inherited the leadership of Lebanon's second-largest city, Tripoli,
from his elder brother, the late Prime Minister Rashid Karami.
   Rashid Karami, the longest-serving prime minister since Lebanon
gained independence from France in 1943, was assassinated by a bomb
put aboard an army helicopter on June 1, 1987.
   Hoss formed his Cabinet hours after the election of
Syrian-backed Hrawi to implement an Arab League-brokered peace plan
to end the civil war.
   Its main achievements were crushing an 11-month mutiny by rebel
Gen. Michel Aoun on Oct. 13 and unification of Beirut's Moslem and
Christian sectors on Dec. 3.
   Creating ``greater Beirut'' was a key step in the peace accord.
   Hoss' Cabinet also enacted constitutional reforms to distribute
power equally between Moslems and Christians.
   Hoss' aides say privately he has been uneasy about Hrawi's
insistence on making major decisions and handling state affairs
exlusively.
   The peace accord, worked out by Lebanese lawmakers in Taif,
Saudi Arabia, in October 1989, maintained the presidency for
Maronites, the premiership for Sunnis and the house speakership for
Shiite Moslems.
   It stripped the president of his traditional decision-making
power, stressing such powers required ``approval of both the
president and the Cabinet.''
   The new government must fill 31 vacancies in Parliament by
appointment and raise the number of seats from 99 to 108 to attain
equality between Christians and Moslems. Christians have had a
6-to-5 edge in Parliament.
   Because of the civil war, no parliamentary election has been
held since 1972. The house repeatedly extended its four-year terms.
   Plans to reconstruct Beirut, shore up the economy and reinstate
government authority over the rest of Lebanon must be considered by
the new Cabinet.
   The civil war has claimed more than 150,000 lives and caused up
to $18 billion damage, according to U.N. estimates.
   Plans call for setting up an Arab and international fund early
next year with $2 billion earmarked for reconstruction.

   A man who fled to Italy in 1988 to avoid
charges that he served three women drug-laced spaghetti and raped
them has voluntarily returned to Cincinnati to face the charges.
   Nicola Iannone, 35, struck a deal with Hamilton County
prosecutors and was jailed without bond in Cincinnati to await a
Dec. 27 hearing, his lawyer, Martin Pinales, said Wednesday.
   Pinales, who was with Iannone when he returned from Italy and
surrendered Tuesday to authorities at Kennedy Airport in New York,
would not reveal details of the plea bargain.
   ``It was an agreement I reached with the prosecutors,'' Pinales
said. ``I'm not at liberty to discuss it.
   Iannone is charged with rape, gross sexual imposition and
corrupting another with drugs.
   The indictment alleges he sexually assaulted three women in
October 1987 and February 1988 in their Cincinnati apartments after
serving them drug-laced spaghetti.
   The women told police they woke up without their clothes on
after eating dinners Iannone prepared.
   Police said laboratory analyses showed the leftover spaghetti
contained codeine and the prescription sedatives Valium and Elavil.

   It is not nice, and definitely illegal,

   That was the lesson learned by Carl Vikstrom, 43, who allegedly
did the deed Tuesday to Sport, a horse ridden by police officer
Will Smoke in downtown San Jose.
   Sgt. Greg Trapp said state law provides that police dogs and
horses may not be harassed, annoyed, teased or agitated. The

   A Greyhound bus collided with a truck
during a blinding Mojave Desert sandstorm Wednesday, setting off a
chain-reaction crash that injured at least 44 people, authorities
said.
   No deaths were reported among the 26 bus passengers or the
occupants of at least 10 other vehicles involved in the pileup on
Interstate 15, the California Highway Patrol said.
   Bus driver Bill McBean said visibility suddenly dropped to zero
during the sandstorm and he swerved to avoid a flatbed truck
stopped in his lane.
   ``It was too late to do anything but to pull off into the
median,'' said McBean. ``This happened so fast.''
   The bus struck the rear of the flatbed truck, tearing off the
bus door. McBean, 51, managed to keep the bus upright.
   ``Yeah, I think the bus driver saved a lot of lives,'' said
passenger James Messner, 51, of Capac, Mich.
   Messner said there was no panic among the passengers, who
knocked out windows and climbed out of the bus.
   Passenger Mark Castillo, among those who boarded the bus in Los
Angeles and were bound for Las Vegas, estimated the bus was going
about 40 mph.
   ``It was really dusty. It was just a sandstorm. At one point it
got so you couldn't hardly see anything. ... You could barely see
the line going down the middle of the road.''
   The sandstorm developed when a blustery weather front moved
through California, bringing cold, rain and snow to many areas of
the state.
   Both lanes of I-15 were closed for two to three hours after the
11 a.m. accident, said highway patrol Lt. Gary Haley, who confirmed
that visibility was zero at the time of the crash. The site is a
few miles east of Barstow and 100 miles northeast of Los Angeles.
   Maureen Bodine, nursing supervisor at Barstow Community
Hospital, said eight people were treated at the hospital. At least
two were in serious condition, she said.
   Fire Department spokesman Loney Weems said 36 people were
treated at the Yermo fire station for minor injuries, mostly cuts
and scrapes.
   Tuesday, a tractor-trailer rig collided with a Greyhound bus and
a truck on an icy highway in Utah, killing seven people and
injuring 41. The crash was on Interstate 80 near the Utah-Wyoming
line.

   Masked Palestinian militants on Wednesday
stabbed to death an Arab man they suspected of collaborating with
Israel, Arab reports and Israel radio said.
   The victim, 40-year-old Mohammed Zaher, was killed near a clinic
run by the United Nations in the Gaza Strip refugee camp of Khan
Yunis, Palestinian journalists based in Gaza said.
   Zaher's death brought to 319 the number of Palestinians killed
by fellow Arabs on suspicion of assisting Israel during the
three-year-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza.
   At least 779 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians in the revolt. Fifty-seven Israelis also have died in
the violence.
   In scattered stone-throwing clashes in the occupied territories
on Wednesday, at least 12 Palestinians were shot and wounded by
Israeli troops, Arab reports said.
   Israel radio said five were wounded in the West Bank village of
Bartaa in a clash that developed after Israel's military government
officials demolished five houses build without proper licenses. The
army command said it was checking the reports.
   In Nablus, the West Bank's largest town, the army also
reportedly sealed shut the house of Shukri Tavila, 24, who was
arrested in August 1989 on suspicion of planning murders of
suspected collaborators.

<TEXT>
   The creators of television's hit comedy
``Designing Women'' have signed a CBS production deal that
guarantees them five new series on the network, officials announced
Wednesday.
   Linda Bloodworth-Thomason and Harry Thomason of Mozark
Productions, which also makes the critically acclaimed CBS series
``Evening Shade,'' have signed a long-term contract to create five
programs exclusively for the network.
   It is the largest series commitment ever made by CBS to a single
production company, the network said in a prepared statement.
   The dollar amount was not revealed.
   ``We specifically wanted to get married to CBS,''
Bloodworth-Thomason said. ``This is a permanent arrangement.''
   The agreement is the second largest production deal of its kind
at any of the big three networks. Stephen Bochco's 10-series deal
with ABC is the biggest production contract with a single company.
   Bloodworth-Thomason said all shows under the new CBS contract
will likely be 30-minute situation comedies. The subject matter and
debut dates have not been finalized, she said.
   ``Obviously we're not going to be running seven shows
simultaneously,'' she said.
   ``Designing Women,'' a sharp-witted comedy about four female
interior designers living in Atlanta, frequently breaks into the
A.C. Nielsen Co.'s top 10 list.
   ``Evening Shade,'' featuring an ensemble cast, including Burt
Reynolds, Hal Holbrook and Marilu Henner, has received favorable
reviews and was recently moved to CBS' highly rated Monday night
lineup, alongside ``Designing Women'' and ``Murphy Brown.''

<TEXT>
   The U.N. Children's Fund on Wednesday
urged world leaders to make good on a recent pledge to help prevent
millions of child deaths from hunger and disease this decade.
   James P. Grant, UNICEF's executive director who issued the
report titled ``The State of the World's Children,'' said, ``The
world has never before undertaken such a global commitment'' as it
did for children in 1990.
   Seventy-one presidents, kings and prime ministers joined envoys
of 88 other nations at the United Nations on Sept. 19, the largest
such gathering in history, to pledge a redoubled effort to save
children.
   The summit set 20 goals for the year 2000, including a one-third
reduction in child deaths, a halving of child malnutrition and the
introduction of basic schooling for at least 80 percent of the
developing world's children.
   An estimated 40,000 child die daily from sickness and
malnutrition. Another estimated 150 million children worldwide lack
proper health care and 100 million children aged 6 to 11 do not
attend school, the report said.
   ``The declarations of political leaders are not enough. The
goals for the year 2000 must become the goals of society as a
whole,'' Grant said.
   The report urged nations to re-examine national spending
priorities and public policies by ``no later than the end of
1991.''
   While the cost of fulfilling the summit goals by 2000 will
require roughly $20 billion a year, much of that figure can be
achieved by a reallocation of resources, the report said.
   It suggested a small reduction in military expenditures, debt
relief linked to investments in children and a reallocation of
funds from high-cost services to low-cost items such as vaccines.
   ``With the ending of the Cold War and the easing of regional
tensions, it cannot be too unrealistic to suggest a 5 percent cut
in defense spending - which would liberate half of the estimated
$20 billion a year needed to reach the year 2000 goals,'' the
report argued.
   At present, the report noted, only about 3 percent of the
industrialized world's aid is devoted to such basics as primary
education and primary health care.
   But UNICEF said its goals are achievable. One of its last
10-year goals, the immunization of nearly 80 percent of the
developing world's children by 1990, has been virtually reached, up
from 15 percent immunization in 1980.
   ``That extraordinary achievement,'' UNICEF said, ``has not only
saved 12 million young lives, it has also given the world new hope
by showing what can be achieved when the international community
commits itself to a great endeavor.''

   The Old Farmer's Almanac, the folksy,
old-fashioned American tradition, has taken on New York Magazine,
the trendy chronicle of life in the big city.
   The 199-year-old Almanac filed a trademark infringement lawsuit
Wednesday accusing the magazine of imitating the Almanac's
distinctive cover design with the Dec. 3 issue.
   The Almanac's publisher, Yankee Publishing Inc. of Dublin, N.H.,
said the covers were so similar that readers might be led to
believe the Almanac authorized or in some way sponsored its use by
New York Magazine.
   The lawsuit said the magazine, by imitating its trademarked
cover, had ``impaired the value of Yankee's cover design and the
goodwill symbolized by it.''
   Susan Soriano, a spokeswoman for the magazine, said the magazine
had not received the lawsuit and had no immediate comment.
   The disputed cover, titled ``The 1990 Christmas Gifts Almanac,''
promotes a story of gift suggestions for the holidays. It is
illustrated in a similar design as used by the Almanac.
   Yankee accuses the magazine of copying, among other things, the
overall distinctive yellow color, the use of red and green
highlights and a red and white border, and a nearly identical style
of typeface.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, seeks an
order barring the magazine from using the design in the future. It
also seeks unspecified damages.
   The Almanac has been published annually since 1792.

<TEXT>
   A South Korean presidential envoy said
Wednesday his country remains committed to the liberalization of
imports despite belt-tightening aimed at combatting social and
economic deterioration.
   For the first time since 1985, South Korea will have a trade
deficit this year, now estimated at $2 billion, former deputy Prime
Minister Soon Cho told a National Press Club gathering.
   ``The economic downturn does not appear to be just an economic
matter, and the whole social and political structure of Korean
society seem to be under strain,'' he added.
   Cho said President Roh Tae-woo dispatched him as a special envoy
to assure U.S. officials that import liberalization remains the
``mainspring'' of trade policy despite growing problems such as
inflation and ``accelerating consumption.''
   He has talked with members of Congress, Commerce Secretary
Robert Mosbacher, Trade Representative Carla Hills and other
economic officials of President George Bush's administration.
   Many U.S. officials believe South Korea has used alleged
over-consumption as an excuse to discriminate against imports.
   Cho said South Korea has undertaken an austerity campaign ``with
the innocuous motive ... to arrest the deteriorating socio-economic
conditions.''
   He said it was unfortunate that the campaign ``carried the smack
of an anti-import'' effort.
   Cho called social and political conditions at home a ``state of
turmoil.''
   Wages have risen at least 20 percent annually for the past three
years and ``workers attitudes have changed for the worse,'' he
said. ``Radical student groups have been trying to instigate
workers and farmers who feel they do not get a fair deal out of the
country's rapid economic growth.''
   Annual manufacturing growth has fallen from 17 to 7 percent and
economic growth is now led by construction, service and
consumption, he said,
   ``Farmers are poorer than urban people'' and feel
industrialization has bypassed them, but they enjoy widespread
sympathy and political power to resist the opening of markets to
imported farm products, Cho said.

   Casual use of cocaine, the most virulent drug
of the 1980s, has fallen 72 percent in the last five years, the
government said in a report issued Wednesday.
   ``The magnitude of the progress is impressive indeed,''
President Bush said at a news conference releasing the Household
Survey on Drug Abuse. ``The news we have today suggests that our
hard work is paying off and our national strategy is having an
effect.''
   But critics, including Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., took issue with
the survey. Biden, D-Del., said it ``misses more addicts than it
counts.''
   Not all the news was positive.
   The survey reported a continuing of a trend found two years ago:
The number of people who used cocaine daily or almost daily rose by
37 percent over five years, from 246,000 in 1985 to 336,000 this
year.
   In addition, the number of current crack cocaine users remained
stable at about a half-million. NIDA Director Charles R. Schuster
said the survey undercounts such users.
   Bush said it's too early to declare a victory despite the
findings that drug use in general is down.
   ``As long as there are hospital rooms filled with drug-affected
babies, neighborhoods ravaged by drug violence or children
threatened by addiction, a declaration of victory would be
premature,'' Bush said.
   About 12.9 million people - 6.4 percent of the population age 12
and older - are ``current users,'' also known as casual users,
meaning they use some kind of illicit drug at least once a month,
according to the survey sponsored by the National Institute on Drug
Abuse.
   That's 44 percent fewer than the 23 million in 1985; an 11
percent decline from the 14.5 million two years ago.
   For current cocaine use, the decline was even more dramatic,
down 72 percent from 5.8 million in 1985 to 1.6 million this year.
Since 1988, the number dropped 45 percent from 2.9 million.
   The survey did not specify how much of a drug was used, only how
frequently it was used.
   On Capitol Hill, Biden said a study by his Senate Judiciary
Committee estimates about 2.4 million people use cocaine at least
once a week, not the 662,000 cited in the Household Survey.
   And the committee report says the number of such hard-core
cocaine users has increased by 200,000, rather than declining by
that number as the NIDA survey indicated.
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of House Select Committee
on Narcotics Abuse and Control, said he believes drug use is
dropping ``among those who are best equipped to avoid the lure of
drugs.''
   ``However, I do not think that drug use has decreased among
those who are a part of the populations that are homeless, in
prison, in hospitals receiving treatment for AIDS and other
drug-related illnesses or similar groups located in our inner
cities,'' Rangel said.
   Administration officials acknowledged that the Household Survey
misses homeless people as well as those in prison, shelters,
drug-treatment centers and other institutions such as dormitories.
They also said 18 percent of the households contacted declined to
participate.
   Schuster estimated that as many as 50 percent of the more than 1
million people imprisoned nationwide are drug users.
   But Dr. James O. Mason, assistant secretary for health, said the
survey's tracking of trends - if not the precise numbers of users -
is accurate because the survey has been administered the same way
all 10 times since 1971. He also said the findings are similar to
those of other studies.
   It's evident the survey misses many drug users.
   For example, it estimates thre are 48,000 current users of
heroin when NIDA has been saying for the past decade that there are
about 500,000 heroin addicts, people who use the drug far more
often than once a month.
   Among the survey's findings, based on interviews this year with
9,259 people age 12 and over:
   -The number of adolescents using any illicit drugs dropped in
the past two years by 13 percent, from 1.9 million to 1.6 million.
For cocaine, the number dropped 49 percent, from 225,000 to
115,000.
   -Emergency rooms are seeing fewer cocaine-related cases. The
number decreased 9.5 percent from the first quarter to the second
quarter of 1990. It's down 33 percent from the highest levels,
recorded in the fourth quarter of 1988 and the second quarter of
1989.
   -Heroin-related emergency room cases dropped 18 percent from the
second quarter of 1988 to the second quarter of 1990, about the
same decrease experienced for all drug-related emergency room
visits combined.
   -Marijuana remains the most commonly used illicit drug, even
though the number of current users has declined 43 percent in the
last five years, from 18 million in 1985 to 10.2 million this year.
   -The number of people who drink alcoholic beverages weekly
declined 24 percent over five years, from 54.6 million in 1985 to
41.7 million this year.
   -Current cigarette users declined 11.1 percent, from 60.3
million in 1985 to 53.6 million this year.
   Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of the Department of Health and
Human Services, said the survey results ``must be greeted with
guarded optimism.''
   ``There are still millions of Americans trapped in the web of
addiction, poor health, violence, crime and death,'' he said.
``Despite this impressive good news about our progress ... many
pockets of serious drug problems remain.''

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Five years after the fall of the
Duvalier family dictatorship, Haitians have finally chosen a
president in this impoverished Caribbean nation's first fully
democratic election.
   Now the probable winner, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, faces
the job of carrying out his pledge to wash away the Duvalier legacy
of repression, corruption and government neglect.
   That legacy includes an army notorious for its human rights
abuses, an ineffectual judicial system, a population with a 65
percent illiteracy rate and a per capita income of $360 a year.
   The danger for Aristide - a charismatic priest with huge popular
support but virtually no government experience - is that he may be
unable to satisfy the high expectations he has raised among the
Haiti's poor.
   They hope he will bring better living conditions and an end to
totalitarian rule.
   Three days after Sunday's election, only 15.3 percent of the
official results had been announced. But they gave Aristide an
overwhelming 65 percent of the vote, in line with the outcome
projected by international observers.
   The priest's nearest competitor among the 10 other candidates,
former World Bank official Marc Bazin, regarded as the Bush
administration's favorite, was a distant second with 11.5 percent
of the vote.
   Aristide will ask opposition parties to form an alliance with
his new government, his major adviser, Evans Paul, said Wednesday.
Paul, co-leader with Aristide of the coalition National Front for
Democracy and Change, said they would especially seek out the
center-right National Industrial and Agricultural Party led by
Louis Dejoie Jr., who drew 27,267 votes, or 8.4 percent.
   Jean-Claude Bajeaux, a prominent human rights activist,
attributed Aristide's apparent landslide win to his fight against
Duvalierists who have gone unpunished for the atrocities of the
29-year dictatorship.
   ``Aristide is the medium through which the people have
discovered the possibility of being protected by being together,''
Bajeaux said. ``That's what the other Haitian politicians didn't
understand. The people wanted justice.''
   Aristide, 37, has been the target of several assassination
attempts, including a 1988 attack at his former church in which at
least 12 of his parishioners were murdered and 70 wounded.
   In the only violence of the election campaign, terrorists hurled
a grenade and fired bullets into an Aristide rally on Dec. 5,
killing seven and wounding more than 50 others.
   ``With the victory of Aristide, the people have taken back Feb.
7, 1986, which the Duvalierists stole,'' said bus driver Pierre
Merveille, 44.
   On that day, Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier fled to France
after a popular uprising, ending the dynasty found by his late
father, Francois ``Papa Doc,'' in 1957. Haitians celebrated then,
expecting broad change. Instead, they have seen five governments,
four controlled by the army.
   Because Aristide is so closely identified with the struggle
against tyranny, Haitians may be expecting more of him than they
would from an establishment politician. But his popularity with the
impoverished masses, ironically, may be his Achilles heel.
   Dr. Louis Roy, president of the interim goverment's advisory
Council of State and principal author of the 1987 Constitution,
said Aristide must move swiftly to make changes.
   ``Within his one-year grace period, he must take the first
spectacular steps to show he intends to strengthen public finances,
the judicial system, ... and provide essential social services,''
Roy said.
   But Aristide risks a backlash from such traditional powers as
the military and the wealthy elite if he clamps down too hard and
too fast, said Anne Fuller, associate director of the New
York-based National Coalition for Haitian Refugees, who was in
Haiti to observe the election.
   ``My feeling is that he's not going to act very quickly on these
things,'' she said.
   Aristide adheres to liberation theology, which encourages the
poor to demand their rights. He was expelled from his conservative
Salesian Order in 1988 for allegedly fomenting revolution.
   He remains a Roman Catholic priest but has said he will renounce
his calling if the Vatican imposes its policy against holding
political office.
   His leftist philosophy has raised concern among the business
establishment and the Bush administration. But the U.S. government
has pledged support for the democratic transition, which is
expected to result in a resumption of large-scale foreign aid.
   Robert Pastor, Latin America specialist at the Carter Center in
Atlanta, who also observed the election, said he thought a critical
decision for Aristide will be the appointment of a prime minister
with sound administrative experience.
   Bazin has been mentioned, but the one-time finance minister and
Aristide are at opposite political poles and Paul said on Wednesday
``there is no possibility'' Aristide would ask Bazin to be prime
minister.
   The army has pledged support for the transition to democracy,
but the intentions of Duvalier sympathizers within remain unclear.
   About 800 international observers, including former President
Jimmy Carter, were on hand for the election. Millions of dollars in
foreign aid poured in for voting materials and equipment.
   Despite serious delays at some polling stations due to
logistical problems, the observers unanimously declared the
election open, fair and peaceful.

   Mikhail Baryshnikov is donating a Picasso painting
worth at least $250,000 to a telethon to help restore historic
monuments in Leningrad, where he began his ballet career, Tass
reported.
   Business leaders, scholars and cultural figures from 100 nations
are planning to attend the Jan. 6-7 ``revival telethon,'' which
will be held at the Leningrad Opera and Ballet Theater, the Soviet
news agency reported.
   Other emigre artists who have agreed to participate in the event
include Mstislav Rostropovich, Natalia Makarova and Rudolf Nureyev,
Tass said.
   The telethon will benefit a restoration project to save the
city's crumbling landmarks and create a Russian emigre center, Tass
said.
   Baryshnikov, 42, defected from the Soviet Union in 1974 and
later became a U.S. citizen. He attended the Vaganova Ballet School
in Leningrad when he was 14 and later joined the Kirov Ballet, the
renowned ballet company.

<HEAD>Former Judge, State Senator Indicted in Corruption Investigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA STARKS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former judge, a city alderman and a state
senator were among five people indicted Wednesday in a federal
investigation of government corruption, prosecutors said.
   ``Public officials who sell their integrity disgrace
themselves,'' said U.S. Attorney Richard Thornburgh. ``We have to
make sure that the country is ruled by justice and not
corruption.''
   Longtime Alderman Fred Roti and Chicago businessman Pasquale
Marcy were charged with racketeering, racketeering conspiracy,
bribery extortion and interstate travel in aid of racketeering.
   Roti, 70, has proclaimed his innocence since reports surfaced
months ago that he was a target of a federal investigation. He
appeared untroubled after a 14-count indictment was issued against
him.
   ``You might say I'm concerned, but I guess you have to learn to
live with it and be strong,'' he said.
   Marcy's attorney said the charges are unsubstantiated.
   Marcy and Roti were charged with six different instances of
paying officials to influence decisions.
   The indictment detailed tampering in criminal non-jury trials
and civil cases in state court, fixing zoning applications in the
city and bribing officials in the appointment of an associate judge
in Cook County Circuit Court.
   Marcy and Roti also were accused of fixing murder trials in
1977, 1981 and 1986. In those cases, the defendants were acquitted
in non-jury trials, investigators said.
   Thornburgh and other officials refused to give details of the
investigation, saying the probe, dubbed ``Operation Gambat,'' is
continuing and more indictments are expected.
   David J. Shields, a former presiding judge in the chancery
division of Cook County Circuit Court, and Chicago attorney
Pasquale De Leo were charged with extortion, false statements and
interstate travel in aid of racketeering.
   Their seven-count indictment charges that De Leo, 45, accepted
$11,000 from an attorney working undercover for the FBI.
Investigators said De Leo delivered some of that money to Shields,
58, to influence the judge's decisions on motions filed during an
undercover case set up by the FBI in 1988.
   De Leo's lawyer, Samuel Banks, said ``my client will persist in
the plea of not guilty.''
   Dan Webb, an attorney representing Shields and Roti, said his
clients will be vindicated in court.
   ``I'm confident we'll be able to establish their innocence,''
Webb said.
   In a third indictment, state Sen. John A. D'Arco Jr. was charged
with two counts of extortion and one count of tax fraud. D'Arco,
46, has been a member of the Legislature for 13 years and is a
member of the Senate's Insurance Committee.
   The indictment charged him with taking a $7,500 bribe from an
FBI agent after agreeing to support insurance legislation. D'Arco
also is charged with failing to report $5,000 of that money on his
1988 tax return.
   His attorney, Jeffrey Steinback, said he will plead innocent.
   Thornburgh said he was shocked at the corruption uncovered in
the investigation.
   ``I think the individual acts of corruption are appalling,'' he
said. ``We're going to be relentless trying to get this type of
corruption exposed through effective prosecution.''
   The public officials face substantial prison terms, if
convicted.
   The extortion, racketeering and racketeering conspiracy charges
bring maximum penalties of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   The maximum penalty for bribery is 10 years imprisonment and a
fine of $250,000.
   The maximum penalty for interstate travel in aid of racketeering
and giving false statements is five years in prison and a $250,000
fine.
   A conviction for tax fraud could bring three years imprisonment
and a fine of $250,000.
   Another wide-ranging undercover probe centered in Chicago was
dubbed Operation Greylord, in which FBI agents posed as corrupt
attorneys to gather evidence on lawyers and Cook County judges.
More than 90 people, including 15 judges, were convicted.
   Since 1978, more than 400 public officials in Chicago have been
convicted on corruption charges.

<HEAD>Boy Seen on TV Being Embraced by Saddam Gets Courage Award</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Stuart Lockwood, a 5-year-old shown on television
with Saddam Hussein when the British boy and other hostages met the
Iraqi leader in August, was awarded a ``Child of Courage'' medal
Wednesday.
   The medal was presented by the Duchess of York, Prince Andrew's
wife, the former Sarah Ferguson, at a ceremony at Westminster
Abbey. During the ceremony, 11 youngsters received medals for
courage and bravery.
   Stuart, who took the duchess' hand and walked her to her car
after the presentations, seemed especially interested in her auto.
``She let me look inside. It had big seats and a telephone,'' he
said.
   The world saw a different side of the boy in Iraqi TV pictures
on Aug. 23. They showed Stuart standing next to the seated Saddam
during a meeting between the Iraqi leader and a group of Western
hostages in Baghdad, Iraq's capital.
   In the footage broadcast worldwide, a smiling Saddam was seen
putting his arm around Stuart's shoulders as the boy tried to
shrink from the embrace. Saddam also patted the boy's head in the
staged show of affection, while an Iraqi military officer ruffled
the boy's hair.
   The TV pictures, shown repeatedly, came to symbolize the
vulnerability of the foreign hostages following Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   Iraq said it staged the meeting between Saddam and the group to
show that the foreign guests, as it called them, were well. But
critics said the televised meeting was a cynical propaganda ploy by
Saddam to use the hostages to try to weaken the coalition of
foreign powers opposing him.
   Stuart and his mother, 39-year-old teacher Glenda Lockwood,
arrived back in London on Sept. 2 among the first foreign women and
children to be released from Iraq. They returned on a plane with
the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who had gone to Baghdad to ask for the
release of foreigners.
   Stuart's father, Derek Lockwood, a 43-year-old engineer, arrived
in Britain to rejoin his family on Dec. 10 after Iraq's decision to
free all foreign hostages.
   Mrs. Lockwood said Wednesday that Stuart had been emotionally
``clingy'' after his return to Britain. But she said the boy had
reverted to his normal outgoing self following the return of his
father.

   An arctic cold front dropped temperatures well below zero
Wednesday on the northern Plains, with wind chill factors down to
77 below, and a snow storm in the Northwest stranded thousands of
youngsters in schools.
   ``It's cold with a capital `C' ... it's the Arctic Express,''
said Chuck McCain, a meteorologist with the National Weather
Service in Denver.
   The cold and high wind knocked out power for thousands and
hampered firefighters battling a schoolhouse blaze in Montana.
Accompanying snow cut visibility and made streets and highways
slippery.
   Four traffic deaths in northern California and two in Oregon
were blamed on slippery roads. During a sandstorm in southern
California's Mojave Desert, a Greyhound bus collided with a truck
near Yermo, near Barstow northeast of Los Angeles. At least 44
people were injured, the state Highway Patrol said.
   A tour group of 82 people who had taken a dinner cruise on a
paddle-wheeler on Lake Tahoe wound up riding buses back to their
hotels early Wednesday after raging weather forced the captain to
beach the craft in a sheltering cove. Nearby Reno, Nev., had wind
gusts to 65 mph.
   ``It's going to be a Merry Christmas in the Sierra,'' said Dan
Nourse, of Alpine Meadows Ski Resort in California's Sierra Nevada
about 40 miles southwest of Reno. ``We got 10-14 inches of new snow
overnight and it's still coming down, although not as heavily.''
   At noon, no city anywhere in Montana reported a temperature
above zero. Kalispell was the warmest at 5 below zero and Great
Falls reported 22 below. The low temperatures combined with brisk
wind to produce wind chill factors as low as 77 below zero at 10
a.m. at Dillon, in the state's southwestern corner. Great Falls had
a record low of 25 below zero, without the wind factored in.
   In western South Dakota, the afternoon temperature at the Rapid
City airport was 13 below zero, but with wind gusting to more than
40 mph, the wind chill was calculated at more than 60 below.
Forecasters issued a winter storm watch for the western part of the
state late Wednesday.
   ``Make no mistake. These are dangerous conditions,'' the
National Weather Service in South Dakota said. ``Skin exposed to
these elements will freeze in only a few minutes. If you must
travel, make sure to carry a winter survival kit.''
   Casper, Wyo., had a wind chill of 60 below and Dickinson, N.D.,
felt like 56 below.
   Volunteer firefighters at Plentywood, Mont., fought vainly in
wind chills of 48 below zero to save the town's high school from
flames. School buses stood by with heaters running to give
firefighters temporary shelter.
   Workers for Mission Valley Power in western Montana struggled
Wednesday to restore power to about 8,000 homes and businesses that
lost electricity. In addition to trees falling on power lines,
circuit breakers at a substation froze, said Dan Swaney, power
company manager in Polson.
   Snow was scattered along the leading edge of the cold air.
Officials at Denver's Stapleton International Airport said flights
were delayed up to an hour because of blowing snow.
   At the Snowy Range ski area west of Laramie, Wyo., resort owner
Terri Colling said 20 inches of snow had fallen since Tuesday
morning.
   The storm spread into eastern Washington, Oregon, northern Utah
and northern California and Nevada.
   Snowfall stopped in Seattle after up to 10 inches of snow nearly
brought the city to a standstill Tuesday. A second day of
temperatures in the teens and 20s locked in a sheet of ice atop the
blanket of snow, making traveling perilous.
   Seventy thousand people in the Seattle area were still without
power Wednesday, down from 100,000 Tuesday, said a Puget Sound
Power &amp; Light Co. spokesman.
   At least 37 schools in King County, where Seattle is located,
had remained open Tuesday night to house roughly 2,600 children and
faculty who couldn't make it home, county emergency services
officials said. Emergency Services spokesman Mike Hagan said the
Red Cross delivered blankets and helped feed the children.
   Most of the children were reunited with their parents Wednesday.
The district closed classes for the rest of the week.
   Residents of Vashon Island, southwest of Seattle in Puget Sound,
were isolated overnight when ferry service was shut down by high
wind and waves up to 14 feet high. Partial service was restored
Wednesday.
   Washington State Ferries spokeswoman Princess Jackson-Smith said
25 passengers and crew had to spend the night on one ferry tied up
at the Southworth dock because they couldn't land at Vashon.
   School closures were reported throughout western Oregon and
slippery roads snarled traffic. In northeastern Nevada, near the
Utah border, Interstate 80 east was closed by snow over Pequops
Summit between Wells and Wendover. Blowing snow also closed a
stretch of U.S. 20 near Idaho Falls, in eastern Idaho.

   A federal judge approved a settlement
Wednesday with the government that stalls deportation of thousands
of Salvadoran and Guatemalan refugees denied political asylum.
   Settlement of a 1985 civil lawsuit on behalf of about 80
sanctuary assistance organizations was signed by U.S. District
Judge Robert Peckham.
   The agreement was supported by the Justice Department, but is
subject to a final approval hearing Jan. 31 in San Francisco.
   ``The settlement applies to every Salvadoran and Guatemalan in
the United States who has been denied asylum since 1980,'' Frand
Deale, legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, said
in a statement from New York.
   The settlement calls for new deportation hearings for thousands
of refugees.
   ``As many as 150,000 denials will have to be readjudicated and
up to 500,000 Salvadoran and Guatemalans will be affected by the
settlement,'' Deale said.
   ``We think it is a fair agreement, but we'll make no further
statement,'' Justice Department spokesman Joe Krovisky said.
   Years of legal wrangling included Peckham's rebuff of government
attempts to dismiss the lawsuit. Peckham rejected government
arguments that the lawsuit depended on foreign policy questions
outside the court's authority.
   The case was handled by Deale's center, the National Lawyers
Guild, the Americal Civil Liberties Union and the San Francisco law
firm Morrison and Forrester.
   The lawsuit, claiming discrimination, contended the government
was violating its own immigration laws by rejecting nearly all
requests for political asylum from natives of the two Central
American countries.
   It said despite civil strife in those countries, only 3 percent
of Salvadorans and less than 1 percent of Guatemalans were granted
asylum on the grounds that they feared political persecution.
   By contrast, the lawsuit said, half or more of the applicants
from such countries as Afghanistan, Poland and Nicaragua were
granted asylum.
   The lawsuit said the disproportional percentages plainly favored
refugees ``fleeing countries deemed to be communist.''
   The plaintiffs said the settlement modified the role of the
State Department by allowing input from other agencies in each
case.
   The State Department ``will now declare that its recommendation
(will be) only one of several factors to be considered by asylum
officers,'' the plaintiffs said.
   In Tucson, Ariz., the Rev. John Fife, one of eight defendants
convicted on conspiracy and alien-smuggling charges in May 1986,
said, ``This is a great Christmas present for refugees, the best
one that I could imagine.
   ``Our basic legal position has now been vindicated, which was
that it was the Immigration and Naturalization Service in violation
of the 1980 law, not the sanctuary movement,'' he said.
   The lawsuit was filed against the INS and the U.S. attorney
general after sanctuary movement activists were indicted in 1985,
stemming from the government's undercover infiltration and secret
tape-recording of church services and meetings.

   The handwriting is on the wall for
California graffiti artists: A scribble could leave them walking
for a year.
   Beginning Jan. 1, a new law will allow courts to suspend the
driving privileges for a year for anyone over the age of 13
convicted of graffiti-type vandalism.
   Another new law that takes effect with the new year will permit
cities and counties to tax aerosol spray cans 10 cents each and
indelible felt-tip markers five cents each to pay for graffiti
cleanups.
   The laws are aimed at curbing the gang-related scribbling and
unsightly markups that deface the environment, such as a recent
case in Los Angeles in which one youngster caused $500,000 in
damages.
   ``The economic consequences of graffiti vandalism are
enormous,'' said state Sen. Quentin Kopp, author of the license
bill.
   ``San Francisco spent over $2 million last year cleaning up
graffiti. The city of Los Angeles spent $9 million. Graffiti also
debilitates urban dwellers, because it bolsters the impression that
our cities are crime-ridden and unsafe,'' said Kopp, an independent
from San Francisco.
   Other new graffiti-related laws will make it an infraction to
write graffiti on public transit buses or trains and will require
convicted litterers to be sentenced to picking up litter or
cleaning up graffiti.
   Kopp said the California Legislature is getting tough on
graffiti because of the proliferation of scrawls and scribbles in
public places in urban areas.
   Last week, an 18-year-old Los Angeles man was accused of
painting the word ``Chaka'' on 10,000 traffic signs, utility poles,
buildings and walls in Southern California, causing about $500,000
in damage.
   The new law will allow a judge to suspend for one year the
driver's license of a person 13 years or older convicted of
graffiti-related vandalism. If a 13 or 14 year old doesn't yet have
a license, the court can delay issuance of the license for a year
after the teen would otherwise be able to get it.
   California allows driver's licenses at age 16 with a parent's
signature.
   If the 13- or 14-year-old doesn't have another conviction for
graffiti in a year, he or she can ask the court to modify the
suspension. The suspension period can also be cut by one day for
each hour the convicted person spend cleaning up graffiti from
public property.
   Kopp notes that current law allows courts to suspend or delay
driver's licenses for minors convicted of drug and alcohol crimes,
even if the offenses are not driving-related.
   ``The punishment fits the crime and the criminal, because
teen-agers prize a driver's license above all else,'' Kopp said.
   The American Civil Liberties Union and California Attorneys for
Criminal Justice opposed the bill when it moved through the
Legislature, saying it was inappropriate to deny a license for
conduct unrelated to driving.
   ``More appropriate penalties for these type of minor offenses
would include cleaning up the graffiti, cleaning other public areas
or working with others in painting murals in public places,'' the
ACLU said in a statement opposing the bill.
   ``That's a lame argument,'' Kopp said. ``We do not literally
tailor the punishment to every crime that is committed. We do not
amputate the pickpocket's hand.''

<HEAD>Lincoln Center Opens a South African Musical in Brooklyn</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mbongeni Ngema's ``Sarafina!'' celebrated the
courageous schoolchildren of Soweto, the black South African
enclave that exploded in rebellion against an oppressive white
government in 1976.
   The unusual and often exuberant musical was a surprise success
at Lincoln Center three years ago. It later moved to Broadway for a
long run and is still touring.
   Now Ngema is back in New York with another musical for Lincoln
Center Theater but this time the company has found its way to the
Majestic, an old movie house off Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn where
director Peter Brook presented his ``Mahabharata'' and ``The Cherry
Orchard.''
   The crumbling film palace, deliberately left in a state of
semi-decay, is an evocative home for ``Township Fever,'' Ngema's
latest effort, which is done in conjunction with the Brooklyn
Academy of Music. The shabby surroundings complement a shantytown
of corrugated iron huts strung across the wide stage.
   But the show, which runs about half an hour too long, is not as
consistently stirring as ``Sarafina!'' That's because its more
polemical moments are stridently or broadly dramatized and might
have been more effective if sung or danced.
   But when the music takes over, ``Township Fever'' manages to be
as heartfelt as its precedessor, exuding a theatricality that
reinforces the show's anti-apartheid message.
   In ``Township Fever,'' rebellion is again in the air. Yet the
musical, which opened Wednesday, takes a more ambiguous approach
than ``Sarafina!'' to another turbulent episode in the history of
modern-day South Africa. Ngema's new work looks at black vs. black
in a world where the rules are set by the white minority. Heroes
and villains are not so easily defined.
   The musical puts on stage the 1987 strike by black railway
workers of the South African Transport Services. Ngema personalizes
the events, telling them through a young man named Jazz, his
girlfriend, Tonko, and best friend and eventual betrayer,
Philadelphia.
   During the walkout, several scabs, who go to work for the
railroad, are murdered by strikers. It is the leading character's
friend who fingers the killers. Today, facing death sentences, they
are still in jail.
   Ngema not only wrote the book, music and lyrics for ``Township
Fever,'' but he directed and choreographed the show as well. He's
the one who must take responsibility for lag in interest between
the song and dance.
   Still, ``Township Fever'' soars during those musical moments,
most of them done in mbaqanga, a type of rock music infused with
jazz and found in South African townships. The score is infectious
and rousingly sung by a large cast, particularly Brian Mazibuko as
the doomed hero and Sindiswa Dlathu as his true love. They get
strong help from a distinctive supporting cast as well as from a
large, on-stage orchestra that peers out from behind those township
hovels.
   The dancing has the same vitality found in ``Sarafina!'' One
wishes there were more of it, particularly because the choreography
allows designer Sarah Roberts to show off a colorful array of
exotic costumes.
   But for the most part in ``Township Fever,'' the message is in
the music and when they come together, it makes for a stirring
evening of theater.

   A man who successfully appealed his conviction in
the 1976 car-bomb slaying of a newspaper reporter will be tried
again on a murder charge, the Arizona Attorney General said
Wednesday.
   Contractor and speculator Max Dunlap was charged a second time
in the slaying of Don Bolles, a reporter for The Arizona Republic,
said the state official, Bob Corbin.
   Another man, plumber James Robison, who also won an appeal of
his murder conviction in the case, was charged anew in November
1989. Both men had been sentenced to death.
   Bolles died June 13, 1976, 11 days after a remote-controlled
bomb ripped through his car as he backed out of a hotel parking
lot. Authorities never established a firm motive in the killing and
theories still abound.
   A greyhound breeder, John Harvey Adamson, testified as part of a
plea bargain he planted the bomb that killed Bolles.
   Adamson said Dunlap ordered the bombing to ingratiate himself
with a friend, land and liquor magnate Kemper Marley, who died
earlier this year.
   Bolles wrote extensively about Marley for his newspaper.
   Adamson testified that Robison built the bomb and detonated it.
   The convictions against Dunlap and Robison were overturned on
appeal in 1980 and Adamson refused to testify again unless
prosecutors met certain demands, including an education fund for
his children.
   Prosecutors refused and Adamson eventually was convicted of
first-degree murder in the killing, but an appeals court reduced
his sentence from death to life in prison and the U.S. Supreme
Court let that decision stand.
   Adamson's conviction was upheld, however.
   Corbin said Adamson has agreed to testify in the new cases
against Dunlap and Robison in exchange for immunity from
prosecution on a number of related charges and a maximum prison
sentence of about 20 years on a charge of second-degree murder in
Bolles' slaying.
   Prosecutors agreed to give Adamson credit for about 13 years he
has already served and agreed to parole after he hits the 20-year
mark.
   Corbin, who leaves office in January, has repeatedly derided
Adamson's credibility since the quarrel with prosecutors over his
plea bargain. Corbin would not say why he thought Adamson was a
more credible witness now.
   Corbin insisted he didn't need Adamson's testimony when he
brought the new murder charge against Robison last year, but said
the case against Dunlap was different.
   ``We feel we need to do it on this one,'' Corbin said, refusing
to elaborate.
   Robison pleaded innocent to the new murder charge. A lawyer for
Dunlap, Rick Miller, said his client also will plead innocent.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year ago Thursday, U.S. troops
invaded Panama to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and install
Guillermo Endara as president. Officially, the anniversary is
called a ``day of national reflection.''
   Noriega's opponents and the families of those who died in the
fighting had sought a ``day of national mourning'' but didn't get
it.
   Gone is the euphoria that welcomed the Americans and the removal
of Noriega, now in Miami awaiting trial on drug trafficking
charges.
   U.S. military presence on the streets today, however diminished,
is seen as an irritant by nationalists - one small sign of the
problems Endara faces in his efforts to keep his government alive
and democracy intact in Panama after a troubled year.
   His supporters are turning against him. Labor unrest is on the
rise and a feeling exists that the U.S. military is replacing
Noriega as the real power here.
   ``The United States' interference through its forces and its
ambassador is pretty open,'' said Marco Gandazegui, director of the
private Center for Latin American studies in Panama.
   On Dec. 5, U.S. soldiers were used at Endara's request to quell
a relatively minor revolt of disgruntled police.
   When riots broke out over a law authorizing firing of about 500
public employees who backed a strike call, one of the first people
to meet with legislative leaders was Col. James Steele, head of the
U.S Army Support Group working with the Panamanian government.
   Interior Minister Ricardo Arias Calderon heads the newly
structured civilian police force that replaced Noriega's military.
Government sources said the Americans told Arias Calderon to let
the police ``take care of its own and organize the special military
units the United States wants for Canal security.''
   The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The United States turns the Panama Canal over to Panama at the
end of the century and wants to see the waterway in the hands of a
stable democracy.
   The Roman Catholic Church, a Noriega foe and formerly a solid
backer of Endara, now calls his government ``inflexible.''
   Even the United States says Panama could be vulnerable to
remilitarization.
   ``The specter of militarism reappeared in Panama, and it
represented a clear and real danger to constitutional democracy,''
U.S. Ambassador Deane Hinton said of the police uprising, which
Endara called a coup attempt.
   Hinton told businessmen that ``democracy does not come easily,''
but added: ``The government of Panama has come a long way in a
year.''
   Endara conceded, ``We have many problems and few resources.'' He
said ``much has been accomplished,'' but ``democracy in Panama
remains in danger.''
   His nationally televised speech Wednesday night focused on the
last years of Noriega rule.
   ``A night like tonight, a year ago, was the last night of
tyranny in Panama. The detonator was a military action, of force,
but behind it was a long calvary of suffering, of rebelliousness
and protests,'' he said.
   He urged Panamanians ``not to let this happen again on our soil.
... The calvary is over.''
   Losses from looting and other causes not stemming from the
fighting a year ago have been estimated at up to $1.5 billion.
Endara has suggested the United States owes reparations for
invasion damage, but no amount has been mentioned.
   The high expectations of many following Noriega's overthrow,
which according to the U.S. Southern Command left up to 345
soldiers and civilians dead, have now turned to frustration. The
government is accused of inactivity and worse.
   Only about $84 million has been used of $461 million in U.S. aid
allotted for Panama. Much has been held up pending reforms
Washington asks in banking secrecy laws and the like, most aimed at
drug trafficking an money laundering.
   Leaders here find it hard, politically, to support the demands.
   The military has ruled Panama, often behind a civilian facade,
since 1968. The military's loss of stature apparently was behind
the uprising of retired Col. Eduardo Hererra and about 35 followers
this month. They said they acted to get more respect from a
civilian government that had humiliated them.
   Noriega's Defense Forces had 16,000 members. The civilian police
force that replaced them has 13,000, with drastically reduced
duties and about half the budget formerly allotted. About 40
percent of the officer corps has been ousted.
   Endara defended his asking for U.S. troops to put down the
uprising, saying it ``avoided the return of a dictatorship and a
bloodbath of Panamanians.''
   The president inherited a wrecked government and ruined economy.
Despite withering problems, progress has been made.
   Unemployment is at about 25 percent, but substantially better
than a year ago.
   The economy is growing again after years of shrinkage.
   ``It is not true that we haven't done anything,'' Arias Calderon
protests. ``We have done a lot with human rights, democratization
and returning confidence ... economic activation ... international
recognition.''
   Panama is moving to reduce its $3.8 billion foreign debt, after
Noriega suspended payment on it for two years.

<HEAD>Disney Agrees To Stop Selling `Steve The Tramp' Dolls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Walt Disney Co. has decided to stop
selling a doll that depicts a street tramp after pressure from
homeless activists.
   The Rev. Christopher Rose, who inspired the protest early this
month, called the action ``a hollow victory'' because there isn't
enough time to recall the dolls before Christmas.
   ``Steve the Tramp,'' a 5-inch plastic figure and one of a series
of 14 ``coppers and gangsters'' based on the story of ``Dick
Tracy,'' sparked protests from advocates for the homeless who said
the description on its package degraded those living on the
streets.
   The tramp is described as ``hardened and bitter after a life on
the mean streets ... a lout who would just as soon take your life
as your wallet.''
   Rose, rector of Grace Episcopal Church in Hartford, cited Steve
the Tramp as one of the most offensive toys of the 1990 Christmas
season. Rose has an annual display he calls ``Warped Toys for
Christmas.''
   ``I'm glad somebody there got a conscience,'' Rose said Tuesday
when he learned of Disney's action.
   In recalling the doll, the Walt Disney Co. in Burbank, Calif.,
said in a statement Monday it felt the doll was ``misunderstood''
when viewed outside the fantasy world of Dick Tracy.
   Joining in the statement was Playmates Toys Inc. of La Mirada,
Calif., which is licensed by Disney to manufacture and market the
toy.
   ``Playmates has decided to discontinue production and
distribution of the doll. Disney has removed the figure from
shelves at its chain of retail stores and theme parks,'' the
statement said.
   ``Because we are concerned that this product may be conveying a
negative image of our nation's homeless, we feel it is appropriate
to stop selling the toy.''
   Chuck Champlin, a Disney spokesman, acknowledged that it was too
late to get the toys off the shelves of all retailers before
Christmas.
   Some retailers discontinued sale of the doll after advocates for
the homeless protested and picketed stores.

   Burmese dissidents have declared a
rival government and denounced military rulers for failing to hand
over power to the opposition, which won free elections seven months
ago.
   ``Burma has become a country shrouded by darkness because of all
the unlawful arrests, tortures and persecutions and human rights
violations,'' the dissidents said in a declaration issued Tuesday
and seen in Bangkok on Wednesday.
   Diplomats in Rangoon said they feared the move could prompt a
new clampdown by the government.
   The dissidents, calling themselves the National Coalition
Government of the Union of Burma, said they had picked Sein Win as
prime minister.
   He is a cousin of Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader whose
National League for Democracy won 80 percent of the parliamentary
seats contested in May's national election.
   The opposition leader has been under house arrest since July
1989, and her party has not been allowed to govern. On Tuesday,
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar urged the Burmese
government to release her.
   The military government said Wednesday night it would free Ms.
Suu Kyi only if she left Burma to join her family in Britain. Its
reply to Perez de Cuellar came in a Foreign Ministry statement
carried by state radio.
   Most of the party's leaders have been detained since the army
took power by crushing a nationwide movement for democracy in 1988.
   Sein Win said forming the new body ``was the only option for us
to choose because this military junta has no will and no way to
transfer power to the people.''
   The announcement of the formation of a new government was made
at the headquarters of the Karen National Union in Manerplaw, about
120 miles northeast of Rangoon on the frontier with Thailand. The
Karen are an ethnic rebel group that has fought successive
governments in Rangoon since the 1940s.
   The dissidents named an eight-member Cabinet, all of whom had
won parliamentary seats in the election. Six are League members and
one is an independent. Sein Win is a member of the closely allied
National Democracy Party.
   All had fled under threat of arrest when their plan to form a
parallel government became known to the Rangoon government. The
military government said earlier this month it had arrested 48
members of the National League for Democracy for involvement in the
plan.
   Diplomats from Rangoon have said the figure could be higher.
   The dissidents called for the immediate elimination of the
military administration, a national convention including members of
parliament and insurgent groups, and the establishment of a
democratic government.
   Their goal, they said, was to create ``an independent,
prosperous and modernized Federal Union of Burma.''
   Troops killed thousands of people crushing the pro-democracy
movement in 1988. Amnesty International and other human rights
groups say hundreds and perhaps thousands of dissidents have since
been detained without charge or trial or sentenced to prison terms
after unfair military trials.
   Amnesty has cited numerous reports of routine torture of
dissidents, particularly of members of insurgent groups.
   A Rangoon-based diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Tuesday the declaration of a rival government could give the
military an excuse to intensify its crackdown on the opposition. He
said it might even provide a pretext for it to declare the National
League for Democracy illegal.
   A powerful member of the Rangoon government warned in newspaper
interview published Tuesday that the declaration would be ``a great
mistake.''
   Maj. Gen. Khin Nyunt, Burma's head of military intelligence,
told the Bangkok Post the existing government was recognized by the
United Nations and he did not believe that any country would
recognize a government-in-exile.
   Western diplomats expressed doubt that the breakaway group would
garner much popular support inside Burma. The Democratic Alliance
of Burma, an umbrella organization of 21 ethnic and other rebel
groups fighting the central government, backed the declaration. The
Karen are members of the DAB.

   A woman suing a former gynecologist she says
performed expiremental ``love surgery'' on her without her consent
was cquitted Wednesday of a burglary charge involving an alleged
break-in at his house.
   A jury found the woman, Janet Phillips, guilty of a misdemeanor
charge of criminal trespass at the home of James C. Burt.
   Ms. Phillips is among about 40 women who have sued Burt in
connection with his self-described ``love surgery'' on female
genitalia, designed to increase sexual responsiveness.
   The women claim Burt performed the surgery either without their
consent or by fraudulently obtaining their consent.
   Ms. Phillips' lawsuit is expected to be the first to go to
trial.
   ``It's been very hard on me and my children,'' Ms. Phillips said
after the Common Pleas jury made its decision. ``I feel like I can
sleep tonight. It was an extremely long ordeal.''
   The burglary charge against Ms. Phillips, 44, carried a maximum
penalty of 15 years in prison and a $7,500 fine. The trespass
charge is punishable by a maximum 30 days in jail and a $250 fine.
   Ms. Phillips was accused of entering Burt's suburban Washington
Township home between Jan. 1, 1989, and March 30, 1989. Prosecutors
said she broke in and took a lapel pin as ``psychological
retribution.''
   Ms. Phillips' lawyer, James Rion, told the jury the home was
unoccupied and his client took nothing.
   Burt surrendered his medical license in January 1989 just days
before he was to appear at a disciplinary hearing.
   The Ohio Medical Board board earlier charged that the surgery in
some cases resulted in sexual dysfunction, emotional distress,
infection, chronic pain and the need for corrective surgery.

   The Cabinet approved Thursday a new five-year
defense plan that will slow the growth of military spending but
increase Japan's share of the cost of keeping U.S. soldiers on its
soil.
   The average annual increase in military spending will be 3
percent during the new $171 billion plan that begins next spring,
down from more than 5 percent annual growth the past five years.
   ``The Soviet Union was a potential threat for Japan in the past,
but we now believe that our potential threat ... has disappeared,''
Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji Sakamoto said at a news conference.
   Tokyo will shoulder more of the costs of basing 50,000 U.S.
soldiers in Japan, increasing its share from about 40 percent to 50
percent within five years, according to the government.
   ``The Japan-U.S. security treaty is the core of Japan's defense
policy, and therefore we will continue to increase our support for
U.S. troops in Japan,'' Sakamoto said.
   Japan now pays about $3 billion annually toward stationing U.S.
troops here, including many of the expenses for the 22,000 Japanese
base workers.
   Under American pressure to pay more, Japan is now offering to
cover the basic salaries of Japanese base workers and utilities by
the end of the new 5-year plan, Sakamoto said. He said the
additional cost to Japan would be $1.65 billion over five years.
   The U.S. Embassy had no immediate comment on the proposal.
   The United States, which has provided a defensive umbrella for
Japan since World War II, has in the past pressed this nation for
bigger military buildups.
   But Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has argued that Japan's defense
spending should reflect the easing of the Cold War in Europe.
   Sakamoto said there would be no increase in the number of
Japanese army soldiers, who now number 153,000. He said the
government would consider troop cuts after three years.
   Defense Agency officials and senior lawmakers of Kaifu's
governing Liberal Democratic Party have opposed a sharp defense
budget cut, saying the reduction in tensions has not yet extended
to the Far East.
   Even with slower growth, the new program will include purchase
of such advanced items as airborne warning and control systems,
which are flying command posts, according to a military official
who spoke on condition of anonymity.

   Ten people protesting the removal of a
feeding tube from Nancy Cruzan were forcibly removed from a
hospital Wednesday and outside doors to the building were locked as
demonstrations continued outside.
   Ms. Cruzan's condition deteriorated in the fifth day since a
feeding tube was removed Friday, said Barbara Shoun, a spokeswoman
for the Missouri Rehabilitation Center.
   Her parents fought lengthy legal battles before winning the
right to remove the feeding tube in the first right-to-die case
decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. They contend their daughter
would not want to live in her present state.
   Ms. Cruzan, 33, has been in a persistent vegetative state since
a 1983 car accident.
   A leader in the anti-abortion movement was on his way to this
southwest Missouri town in an attempt to meet with the parents to
try to persuade them ``not to kill their daughter.''
   Randall Terry, founder of Operation Rescue, was expected to
arrive in Mount Vernon by Thursday, said Bob Jewitt, an Operation
Rescue spokesman in Atlanta.
   ``This may be the most important story in the pro-life
history,'' Jewitt said. ``This woman is not in a persistent
vegetative state. She is not a carrot. She's a human being with
blood in her veins and she must be saved.''
   Joe and Joyce Cruzan will not meet with Terry, said their
attorney, William Colby.
   ``They had an auto accident that took their daughter and they
were faced with two horrible decisions and now somebody they love
very much is dying,'' Colby said.
   ``There is enough pain from the auto accident that to compound
that by having a group of strangers who never knew Nancy
interfering with the medical decisions is inappropriate,'' he said.
   About 20 demonstrators gathered at the hospital Wednesday and
some were allowed into the hospital chapel. Some then demanded to
meet with the center's director and went to his office and began
kneeling and praying and refusing to leave, Mrs. Shoun said.
   About eight or 10 of the demonstrators were put in wheelchairs
and pushed out of the building. Others were told to leave and did
so, Mrs. Shoun said.
   ``We've told groups that want to protest that they're welcome to
come - as long as they stay outside,'' Mrs. Shoun said.
   About a half-dozen protesters camped on the front steps
Wednesday afternoon, kneeling and praying. One held a sign that
said ``Please feed Nancy.''
   Authorities arrested 19 people Tuesday who were held in the
Lawrence County Jail on $500 bond. All identified themselves as
Nancy Cruzan and the sheriff's department said they could not be
bonded out until they gave their real names.
   All but one was fasting.
   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June that Missouri could require
``clear and convincing'' evidence that Ms. Cruzan would want to
die.
   The Cruzans went back to local court where three friends and
co-workers of Ms. Cruzan testified they had talked about such a
situation and Ms. Cruzan had indicated she would want to die.
   Probate Judge Charles Peel ruled Friday there was sufficient
evidence to allow the tube to be removed.

<HEAD>Jury Agrees to Death Penalty for Convict Who Requested It</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jurors on Wednesday granted a
convicted murderer's request for the death penalty for the 1983
slaying of a jewelry store employee.
   ``You'd be making a very correct decision by sentencing me to
death,'' Jermarr Arnold told the jury, which recommended death by
lethal injection to a judge.
   The end of the trial's punishment phase means Corpus Christi
Caller-Times reporter Libby Averyt no longer faces the possibility
of being jailed again in the case.
   Ms. Averyt was jailed Dec. 7 for refusing to answer questions
about unpublished information from her interviews with Arnold, 32.
   Prosecutors did not enter as evidence her stories that led to a
constitutional confrontation with the newspaper.
   District Judge Eric Brown, who had found Ms. Averyt in contempt
of court for not answering questions in a pre-trial hearing,
allowed her release from jail Dec. 9. But she remained under
subpoena until the trial ended.
   In refusing to answer questions, Ms. Averyt cited protection
under the First Amendment.
   She said Wednesday she would have done the same thing if called
back to the stand.
   Arnold told the jury he had no apologies, excuses or remorse for
killing 21-year-old Christina Marie Sanchez during a robbery.
   A death sentence prompts an automatic appeal. Brown said he
would await the outcome of the appeal before setting a sentencing
date.

   SHANNON, Ireland - President Bush's top military deputies are
heading to Saudi Arabia to discuss plans for war with Iraq, but
they concede some ground forces won't be ready to fight by the
deadline for Saddam Hussein to leave Kuwait.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were arriving in the Saudi capital of
Riyadh today for two days of meetings with American and Saudi
military officers. Then they will spend two days making
pre-Christmas visits with U.S. troops in the region.
   Cheney and Powell, speaking with reporters traveling with them,
said the United States will be ready to go to war by the Jan. 15
United Nations deadline regardless of whether all reinforcements
have arrived in the region and reached combat readiness.
   They refused to give specifics of the plans they were to discuss
with the senior U.S. commander in the Middle East, Army Gen. H.
Norman Schwarzkopf, saying they did not want to tip their hand to
Saddam, the Iraqi president.

   WASHINGTON - Some of the 125,000 reservists called to active
duty for the Persian Gulf crisis may be away from their homes and
jobs longer than they had imagined.
   The Defense Department said Tuesday it may ask Congress for
authority to keep non-combat reservists on active duty for a full
year. The current limit is six months.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney has made no final decision but probably would seek the extra
authority after Congress returns in late January.
   Non-combat reservists provide support such as medical care,
intelligence analysis, aircraft maintenance, truck driving, water
purification and legal assistance. They account for about 110,000
of the reservists called up from all four services.

   LONDON - Amnesty International issued a reported today charging
that Iraqi occupation forces in Kuwait have tortured and killed
hundreds of people, including 300 premature babies who died because
incubators were stolen.
   Amnesty's first comprehensive description of abuses in occupied
Kuwait since the Iraqi invasion on Aug. 2 gives few precise
figures.
   But Norma Johnson, the human rights organization's head of
communications, said today that ``About 1,000 people have been
executed, many hundreds have been tortured and something like
10,000 still remain in detention in Kuwait.
   ``People going out of their homes to buy food, innocent
Kuwaitis, are being picked up by the Iraqi troops, taken back to
their homes, and hen they are identified by their parents, for
example, are simply being shot in front of them,'' she said in a
radio interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON - The Bush administration's new policy on
race-exclusive scholarships is only increasing the confusion on
what colleges and universities can and cannot do for minorities,
educators and lawmakers say.
   ``It's ripe for a lawsuit,'' said Tom Jipping of the
conservative Free Congress Foundation. ``I hope it happens.''
   Robert Atwell, president of the American Council on Education,
said, ``The confusion is considerable. It's only made worse by this
clarification.'' The revised policy still threatens most
scholarships for minority students, said Atwell, whose group
represents about 1,800 public and private colleges and
universities.
   Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., called a hearing today by his
House Education and Labor Committee in an effort to clear up
questions about the administration's decision to retreat from its
decision to ban college scholarships based solely on race.

   JACKSON, Miss. - New witnesses, including a former Ku Klux
Klansman, led to a new murder charge against an aging
segregationist who twice escaped conviction in the 1963 ambush
slaying of civil rights leader Medgar Evers.
   Byron De La Beckwith, 70, of Signal Mountain, Tenn., was freed
on $15,000 bail Tuesday for a Feb. 22 hearing on whether he should
be returned to Mississippi to stand trial a third time.
   The retired fertilizer salesman, who flies the Confederate flag
outside his home, was defiant during a court appearance in
Chattanooga, Tenn.
   ``I'm going to resist tooth, nail and claw because I think all
this is nonsense, poppycock and something to stir the people up ...
and incite the lower forms of life to force and violence against
the country clubs,'' he said.

   HOUSTON - A sweepstakes offering a trip aboard the Mir space
station was pronounced a hoax by the official Soviet news agency,
and the contest operators were called to appear today before a
grand jury.
   The district attorney's office Tuesday subpoenaed three
executives of Space Travel Services to answer questions on whether
the promotion - which contestants can enter by dialing a 900-number
for $2.99 - violates Texas lottery laws.
   ``There's just so much information coming from so many sources
so fast we just had to look into it. We're dubious,'' said Russell
Turbeville, head of the consumer fraud division. Texas law bars
charging people for a chance to win something.
   Space Travel insisted it has a contract with the Soviets and
said the Tass news report calling the sweepstakes a hoax resulted
from a misunderstanding. The Houston company also said the contest
is legal because people can also enter by mail for free.

   LONDON - Big Ben's chimes, which traditionally announce the
queen's Christmas Day message and ring in the New Year, might not
make it onto BBC airwaves this time around. Seems the main bell has
lost its distinctive bong.
   A decision has yet to be made, and some British Broadcasting
Corp. officials think it would be a big mistake depart from
tradition by banning the bong this holiday season.
   Big Ben's bells have traditionally been used on BBC airwaves as
a lead-in to news bulletins, but disappeared temporarily in March
after cracks were found in the hammer arm of the 132-year-old main
bell that sounds the hours.
   The original Victorian hammer was removed and replaced with a
new $15,000 steel hammer.

<TEXT>
   The rich patrimony of artworks and archaeological
relics in Italy's churches, ruins and museums is slipping away
through a sieve of inadequate security and border controls.
   Many Italians feel the virtual elimination of border
restrictions between European Community nations in 1993 will amount
to holding the door open for art smugglers and saying, ``Have a
nice trip.''
   They also worry that objects legitimately purchased from
collectors or dealers will cross borders without records, making
research more difficult for art historians and archaeologists.
   Italy has led efforts to preserve some controls on cultural
treasures.
   Holding the European Community's rotating presidency this fall
gave it the perfect opportunity to press the issue. The Italians
soon found the lines firmly drawn in what has been called the
battle of the haves and have nots.
   On Italy's side are other Mediterranean ``haves'' like Spain and
Greece. France, which always has tried to keep its art at home,
also has pressed for controls.
   Britain is the leading advocate of a liberalized art market. It
has less to protect and is a center of the international art
market.
   When talks began in May, the two camps ``were farther apart than
on monetary unity,'' said an official of the Italian Foreign
Ministry.
   In late November, with Italy's term as president running out,
culture ministers asked the EC executive branch to consult experts
on devising a system for returning illegally exported treasures.
   They also agreed to consider certifying artworks and artifacts
and tightening controls on art leaving the Community.
   Spain proposed that each item be issued a kind of visa. Britain
has said it might consider certification for pieces beyond a
certain worth, but the ministry official said that would not work
for Italy.
   ``A small Etruscan vase can be worth only 5 million lire
($4,300), but for us, the value is much more,'' he said, because it
helps complete the story of a collection found in a particular
tomb.
   Robert Spengler of the French Culture Ministry said a ``small
government ministry'' might be required to handle certification.
   Another suggestion is restricting the scope of what constitutes
a nation's heritage.
   On Dec. 13, The European Parliament urged EC nations to use
better-trained custom officials and adopt tougher laws on sales of
art and artifacts. It also said member nations shouild respect each
other's laws on the subject.
   Those laws vary widely.
   In Italy, anything unearthed of archaeological interest becomes
state property.
   If a stone lid of an Etruscan sarcophagus turns up in Holland,
can the owner be forced to give it back, especially if he can prove
he brought it in good faith from a reputable dealer? Would it all
end up at the World Court?
   Alessandra Melucco of the Central Institute of Restoration in
Rome said other countries had little sympathy for Italy, given its
failure to protect excavations and museums adequately.
   A superintendent of art in Naples, in desperation, ordered a
sculptured 15th-century church entrance walled up this fall soon
after it was restored. He said that was the only way to keep
vandals and thieves from striking again.
   Rome's archaeology superintendent, Adriano La Regina, thinks
1993 might not be so bad.
   ``It's better that objects are displayed in a museum, wherever
it is in the world, than to stay in our storerooms on the
theoretical pretext that they must be studied, while nobody studies
them,'' he said at a forum sponsored by Archeo, an Italian
archaeology magazine.
   After years of talk, Parliament approved funds this year for an
ambitious inventory of Italy's cultural riches. Police recall
countless thefts in which the museum or church did not have a photo
that might aid in recovery.
   Baldassare Conticello, superintendent at Pompeii, said at the
forum:
   ``If an object is stolen, and you can prove it, in the end it
will return, since theft is covered by legislation of all nations.
But only a few `producer states' such as us, Greece, Turkey and
Cyprus have laws covering wealth that's underground.''

<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buras Vertimor was 6 years old in 1975
when Indonesian invaders dropped from the sky above his home in
East Timor.
   Now he is 21, part of a new generation of East Timorese who
continue resisting Indonesia's annexation of their half of the
island. West Timor is part of Indonesia, but East Timor formerly
belonged to Portugal.
   Vertimor, who fled Timor in September, belongs to an underground
youth movement linked to Timorese guerrillas who are trying to
focus international attention on the largely forgotten conflict.
   Guerrilla leader Xanana Gusmao has described the youth movement
as Indonesia's ``fundamental problem'' in East Timor.
   Robert Domm, an Australian trade unionist who met with Gusmao in
September, says young people have been radicalized by the struggle.
   ``A whole new generation of Timorese are in some ways even more
militant than the older generations,'' he said during a visit to
Lisbon.
   The resistance campaign, which young Timorese liken to the
Palestinian uprising in Israeli-occupied territories, has taken
advantage of Indonesia's cautious efforts to open the impoverished
territory to outside scrutiny. East Timor was closed to outsiders
after the invasion and annexation.
   Reports after the invasion told of massacres, famine and
epidemics.
   Diplomats in Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, say 60,000 people
died and Roman Catholic Church officials say up to 100,000 Timorese
were killed. Human rights groups estimate nearly one-third of the
population, put at 650,000 by a Portuguese census of 1974-75, died
in the years following the takeover.
   Indonesia has not provided casualty figures. It says East Timor
is peaceful now and Indonesia is introducing economic and social
improvements.
   Vertimor helped organize a student demonstration during the
visit of Pope John Paul II to Dili, capital of East Timor, in
October 1989.
   Security forces arrested him shortly afterward. He said he was
beaten and tortured before his release and flight to Portugal.
   Indonesia accuses Portugal of running a propaganda campaign
against it. The United Nations still considers Portugal, the
colonial ruler of East Timor for nearly 500 years, the legal
authority in the territory.
   The Indonesians say they invaded after Portugal's withdrawal in
1975 left East Timor in chaos. The Revolutionary Front for an
Independent East Timor, known by the acronym Fretilin, won a brief
civil war with conservative and pro-Indonesian forces and declared
independence 10 days before the invasion.
   Fretilin is the main political force behind the guerrillas, who
Indonesia says have been reduced to about 200 poorly armed men who
raid villages for food. Officials of Fretilin claim to have 4,000
guerrillas with logistical and moral support from almost the entire
native population.
   Vertimor said he began working actively for the underground in
1985 after four cousins were killed for aiding the resistance.
   ``I'm a Christian,'' he said, ``but I have the right to hate.''
He said nearly all his generation supports independence.
   After the communist victory in Vietnam in 1975, the West backed
Indonesian President Suharto as a bulwark against communism in
Southeast Asia. The United States and Australia classified Fretilin
as communist.
   Cristiano Costa of Fretilin said the leadership includes
centrists and conservatives as well as leftists. The guerrillas in
East Timor also have the support of the conservative Timorese
Democratic Union, Fretilin's foe in the civil war.
   Gusmao, the insurgent leader, has urged a cease-fire and
negotiations with Indonesia. He says the guerrillas will accept the
results of a U.N.-supervised referendum in the territory.
   In November, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas of Indonesia rejected
negotiations. Alatas said his government does not consider Fretilin
the sole representative of East Timor's people.
   Resistance leaders acknowledge Indonesian investment in the last
several years has improved the economic situation, but say the main
beneficiaries are thousands of Indonesian immigrants sent to East
Timor since annexation.

^More Offbeat Mozart by Sellars in '91</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peter Sellars tends to do things a little
differently - even Mozart. For starters, he set ``The Marriage of
Figaro'' in Manhattan's glittering haven for all that glitters,
Trump Tower.
   That was last week, when PBS aired the first of three Mozart
operas that the innovative American directed for the long-running
``Great Performances'' series.
   On Jan. 4, viewers will be offered the Sellars edition of ``Don
Giovanni.'' Filmed in Vienna and set in Spanish Harlem, it features
a cocaine-snorting Don who likes to consume Big Macs and stage
orgies.
   On Feb. 15, his ``Cosi Fan Tutte'' will arrive. It's set in a
Westchester County diner.
   Sellars, whose shows all have English subtitles, says he's done
all this ``so Americans who have not taken a course in Baroque
costume design can understand the characters and the social
structure.''
   During last week's ``Figaro'' overture, footage of posh
Manhattan stores, shoppers and limousines was shown. The ``Don
Giovanni'' overture plays over street scenes in the South Bronx -
ruined buildings, graffiti and dead rats.
   The 33-year-old director says that he used New York locales
because they're recognized worldwide. Mozart put ``Figaro'' and
``Don Giovanni'' in Seville, which Sellars says was similarly
``known'' 200 years ago.
   ``We did these operas to please two sets of people - people who
know nothing about opera and connoisseurs who can tell the
sophisticated choices we're making musically,'' he says.
   Sellars, whose productions often cause outrage and uproar among
traditionalists, sees Mozart as a man of the moment.
   ``Mozart wrote the most topical operas in the history of
opera,'' says the director. He introduced ``Figaro'' by saying:
``Stay tuned for an evening of out-of-control sexual exploitation
and aggression, political theory and big entertainment.''
   Much as young Americans leave for Saudi Arabia in 1990, ``Cosi''
offers two men who are leaving for war, Sellars says.
   ``In 1791, active duty was the French Revolution which was under
way down the street. When they sing, `People say the army is fun,'
the irony was not lost on Mozart's audience.''
   ``Cosi,'' Sellars says, is also about ``suburban wife swapping''
and is incorrectly called a comedy of manners. ``It burrows to the
root of deceptions that people live with and the quality that these
deceptions have of eroding every piece of happiness you've ever
known.''
   He believes the three operas ``are about how your heart and
everything you believe are always shifting.''
   People of different classes and opposite sexes trade clothes and
identities, he says. ``Mozart says, `OK. Now be in somebody else's
shoes and see what life is like. See that everything you believed
before is open to question.'''
   The operas were performed before a live audience on a stage
built in a TV studio in Vienna.
   ``You get live performances for live people, not lip synching or
the weird pall that comes over singers when they're singing in a
studio to nobody in particular. It's acrobatic staging. They're
doing the wildest motions while staying correct musically.''
   Five American singers, Sanford Sylvan, James Maddalena, Susan
Larson, Frank Kelley and Sue Ellen Kuzma, are in both ``Figaro''
and ``Cosi.'' Eugene Perry sang Don Giovanni, with his twin,
Herbert Perry, as the servant Leporello.

<TEXT>
   Peculiarities, some of them humiliating, surrounded the coming
of that child whose birth is celebrated at Christmas. The
circumstances were strange and disturbing, yet also commonplace.
   It was not the tinseled, decorative affair that characterizes
the modern holiday. Yet odd strands of awe and wonder interwove the
ordinary human behavior described in the records.
   ``How shall this be?'' asked a bewildered Jewish girl, Mary,
when a transcendent message came to her that she would bear a
divine son. ``I have no husband.''
   The upshot, synthesized from biblical accounts, was this:
   Soon, aware of her pregnancy, the troubled girl temporarily left
her parents' home in Nazareth to seek consolation from an older
cousin in Jerusalem, staying three months before returning to
Nazareth.
   A just, local man to whom she had been engaged, the carpenter
Joseph, was bitterly upset at her condition. In distress, he at
first intended to break off their marriage plans.
   But the account says he decided to do so quietly, being
``unwilling to put her to shame.''
   Then at night, tossing about in a dream, in that veiled
intermingling of grief, compassion and conscience, heavenly counsel
came that Mary had conceived by holy means and her son would ``save
his people from their sins.''
   Joseph rose from bed that day, rejuvenated and glad, and took
Mary as his wife.
   But they had tough ordeals ahead, even interludes of terror.
Under the circumstances, ancient, non-biblical accounts say gossip
rimmed their union in Nazareth.
   In any case, when notified he must go to Bethlehem to register
for occupying Rome's taxation, Joseph protectively took Mary with
him, even in her late pregancy, on that dusty, 90-mile trip.
   Tired and footsore, they reached the town, crowded with
travelers, soldiers and tradesmen. Her time had come and Joseph
sought desperately to find lodgings where the child could be
delivered.
   But the inn had no room. Perhaps advised by the innkeeper or
some bystander, Joseph took his worried wife to a nearby
cavern-like stable and made a pallet for her among tethered
animals.
   ``And she gave birth to her first-born son ...''
   It wasn't exactly a prepossessing place to enter the world, a
smelly, dung-littered livestock stall. Not fancy, for sure, not
glittery like the holiday, but a shabby shelter for the homeless.
   It was down with the least and lowliest that the child began
life.
   Afterward, rough-clad shepherds showed up, telling how while
tending flocks in the valley below, a glorious light had fallen on
them. As they trembled in fear, an angelic voice assured:
   ``Be not afraid; for behold I bring you good news of a great joy
... for to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior who
is Christ the Lord.''
   The account says the skies throbbed with sublime music, ``Glory
to God in the highest, and on earth peace among men.''
   In awestruck curiosity, the shepherds went to the hilltop town,
finding the child, as they had been told, ``wrapped in swaddling
cloths, and lying in a manager.''
   After leaving, they excitedly spread word of their experience
among rustic comrades.
   The family apparently settled temporarily in Bethlehem. At eight
days, the boy was circumcized, and later dedicated at the Temple in
nearby Jerusalem to God's service.
   A year or more later the Magi from the East who had discerned
celestial signs of a pre-eminent birth, appeared in Jerusalem,
arousing suspicions of King Herod.
   After visiting the child and offering gifts, they sought to
throw Herod off the trail by returning another way. But it was then
that the terror struck.
   Warned of it in a dream, Joseph roused his family and fled by
night, headed for safety into Egypt. Behind them, blades of Herod's
troops fell on Bethlehem toddlers in a pandemonium of screams and
blood.
   For a year or more, Joseph, Mary and the child remained as
refugees in Egypt, finding whatever shelter and livelihood they
could. It was a time of uncertainty and hardship.
   After Herod's death, they returned to Nazareth in upland
Galilee, where the child grew into adulthood and a ministry that
led to his crucifixion and ensuing resurrection.
   His story, from the beginning, was humbly common, yet most
uncommon. That child was fully human, Christians believe, yet also
fully divine in the human context, ``very God of very God.''
   Wild, incredible, some say, misassuming that humanity negates
godliness. Logically, however, to be perfectly, consummately human
to the utmost, without flaw or failing, must reflect that higher
order, the highest possible in earthly terms. John's Gospel says:
   ``In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God ... And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us,
full of grace and truth.''

year in the financial markets to dull investors' voracious appetite
for mutual funds.
   Thanks to such events as the crisis in the Persian Gulf and the
onset of an economic slump, just about all types of long-term funds
have turned in poor performances for 1990.
   All 14 categories of stock and bond funds monitored by the
Wiesenberger Investment Companies Service showed declines in their
average net asset values for the 12 months through Nov. 30.
   Yet sales of new fund shares to investors show no sign of
flagging, setting their strongest pace since the most ebullient
days of the 1980s bull market.
   Through the first 10 months of this year, reports the Investment
Company Institute, the industry's main trade group, sales of
long-term funds (as opposed to money-market and short-term
municipal bond funds) came to $125.18 billion.
   That put them on the verge of surpassing the $125.71 billion
total recorded for all of 1989.
   When full-year figures are in, they appear certain to rank as
the third best ever, behind only 1986, with sales of $215.85
billion, and 1987, with $190.63 billion.
   An especially striking element of this year's activity is that
sales of stock funds have been running slightly ahead of bond and
other income funds, which represent a larger category.
   That has happened even though the average equity fund's net
asset value dropped 10.7 percent over the last 12 months, by
Wiesenberger's calculation.
   Indeed, ``not since 1974 have such a preponderance of equity
mutual funds shown a loss in any year,'' observes Reg Green, editor
and publisher of the Mutual Fund News Service in Bodega Bay, Calif.
   Steve Norwitz, a spokesman for the Baltimore fund-management
firm of T. Rowe Price Associates, points out that business has been
notably hot for international equity funds, even though nearly all
overseas stock markets also have fallen this year.
   The ICI numbers show international fund sales of $6.97 billion
through the first 10 months this year, more than four times the
$1.54 billion tally at the corresponding point in 1989.
   What to make of all this bullishnessness in the face of
adversity? Most analysts say it sends a clear-cut message that fund
investors are seizing on what they perceive as a buying
opportunity.
   The memory is still fresh in their minds, analysts reason, of
the profits that awaited most people who stepped up to buy in the
aftermath of the crash in '87.
   Some skeptics see this is as a danger sign. Typically, they say,
bear markets don't bottom out until mutual-fund investors have been
scared away in large numbers.
   Optimistic observers, by contrast, say it could be a sign that
fund investors have learned to think longer-term, building up their
holdings in good times and bad.
   In either case, keen enthusiasm among the public for funds may
be at least partly offset by a wary mood among fund managers
themselves. At the end of October, stock funds that report to the
ICI were keeping a record 12.9 percent of their assets in reserve,
``parked'' in money-market investments.
   ``Never before have the funds had so much buying power,'' argues
Norman Fosback, editor of the Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based advisory
Mutual Fund Forecaster. ``Never before have fund managers been so
bearish on the market as to hold such huge amounts of cash.
   ``When portfolio managers are deeply bearish, the market nearly
always proves them wrong by moving sharply higher.''

<HEAD>Banks Aren't Eager for Action</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It may not be as easy as it used to be to slow
or reverse an economic decline.
   Recessions aren't necessarily alike, and what works on one might
not on another. Like strains of flu, they may vary vastly from
their predecessors.
   Dealing with this one may be a particularly onerous task, and
the biggest problem already has been hinted at. It is the poor
financial condition of the banks themselves, and their desire to
keep matters from getting even worse.
   While the Federal Reserve cut the discount rate, or the rate at
which the commercial banks borrow money from the central bank,
those banks seem less inclined than before to pass on those savings
to borrowers.
   That attitude could mess up the Fed's plans. In fact, to some
extent it already has. While the Fed has lowered since summer by a
full percentage point the overnight rate banks charge each other,
the banks haven't lowered their rates to customers.
   The entire idea of an easier Federal Reserve policy - lowering
interest rates or expanding the money supply - is to spur
commercial interaction by pumping money through the banks into the
economy.
   That is the expected remedy, the routine antidote, the aspirin
for treating dangerous economic slides, which the current one has
become. But if the banks let the buck stop with them, would-be
users of that money remain frustrated.
   What makes this recession unlike many others, according to those
who have studied it, is that it is primarily debt-induced. Much of
that debt is owed to banks. The banks can't collect. It has put
them in a dangerous position.
   Rather than pass on savings to customers, therefore, they have
shown a tendency to hoard what funds they have. They are also
retrenching, writing off billions of dollars of loans and closing
many of their lending operations.
   Rather than putting money out in the form of loans, they are
trying to get rid of the loans they already have. In many
instances, loans not written off entirely are packaged for sale at
huge discounts - just to get rid of them.
   Loans and customers got the banks into trouble. They are licking
their wounds. They are declaring their primary goal now is: 1.
survival, and 2. clearing the books for the next upturn, in which
they vow to be more prudent.
   The prime rate at major banks has been at 10 percent all year
long, and there isn't likely to be any rush to lower it
substantially.
   The earliest indication, from a Midwest bank, is for a
one-quarter point drop, which certainly doesn't qualify as
dramatic, except that any decline is rare these days.
Credit-starved customers aren't likely to leap at such a cut.
   In fact, those to whom the prime doesn't even apply -
homeowners, for example - might see more immediate results.
Mortgage rates often are tied to government securities prices - not
to bank attitudes - and could fall sharply.
   That aspect of the Fed's easier money policy by itself could
have a very meaningful consequence for the economy. Many homeowners
are strapped, and mortgage delinquencies are rising. Those with
variable rates, especially those with mortgages up for their
periodic review, could find quick relief.
   The psychological factor also is important. For many months the
Fed had steadfastly declined to let up on its tight money policies,
presumably because it considered inflation its No. 1 enemy.
   Now that relief has finally come, it may generate buying and
selling activity among those individuals and companies that had
been on the sidelines. Just the psychological attitude could be
enough to produce some action.
   That's how economies move ahead, one positive step leading to
another. But don't rely too heavily on the banks. It's unlikely
that they'll be the ones to step out ahead of the pack.

<TEXT>
   Sherman McCoy is a self-styled ``Master of
the Universe,'' an ultimate WASP who moves like hot-buttered
bourbon through the power houses and privileged lairs of New York
City. If he went any higher in life, he'd be God.
   Peter Fallow is a rather rumpled, shallow, smarmy, booze-soaked
journalist who crawls through the sewers of the world struggling
for that one last story. If he went any lower in life, he'd be a
drowned rat.
   The worlds of McCoy (Tom Hanks) and Fallow (Bruce Willis)
combine in Brian De Palma's latest movie, ``Bonfire of the
Vanities.'' And as McCoy falls from grace, Fallow ascends like the
angels.
   Set in New York City, the Warner Bros. release takes some pretty
rough jabs at Manhattan socialites, local politicians and
self-styled religious leaders, the media and especially the Bronx -
that long-lamented stepchild of a borough.
   It was bad enough in Tom Wolfe's best-selling novel, which
explored the social, legal and financial worlds of New York and
found them to be rotten. Now it's up there on the big screen, with
Tom Hanks, Bruce Willis, Melanie Griffith and Morgan Freeman
involved in the nasty goings-on.
   Michael Christopher (``The Witches of Eastwick'') adapted
Wolfe's book. De Palma also produced.
   During filming earlier this year, Bronx Borough President
Fernando Ferrer protested what he considered the poor treatment of
the borough - as a burned-out, ugly, crime-ridden heap - and asked
that a disclaimer run with the movie. One does.
   The plot revolves around McCoy, a Wall Street bond trader, whose
dumb- blonde married mistress, Maria (Melanie Griffith), backs
McCoy's Mercedes into a black teen-ager while they are lost in the
South Bronx. The youth falls into a coma and the police, after
getting part of the license plate from another teen-ager at the
scene, zoom in on Sherman.
   McCoy takes the rap for his mistress, not knowing the political
and racial circus in which he would become embroiled. A district
attorney with ambitions to be mayor (played by F. Murray Abraham),
seizes the incident to further his campaign. A black activist
minister (John Hancock) joins in the circus with everyone else,
including Fallow.
   Hanks, Willis and De Palma were recently in Los Angeles to help
ignite ``Bonfire,'' and they talked about the movie's depiction of
New York.
   ``Actually, there were no actors in this movie; they were all
taken off the street,'' cracked Willis.
   Then, seriously: ``No, it's really a kind of send-up of the
people of New York. Tom Wolfe had an almost prescient vision of
things to come. He wrote some of the characters in the book even
before they emerged in the media. ...
   ``I think Tom Wolfe's view, as is Brian DePalma's view, is a
little tongue-in-cheek. I don't think he's saying, `This is what
life is.' I think he's saying, `This is a kind of melodramatic view
of it.'''
   Willis and his wife, actress Demi Moore, have bought an
apartment in New York, reportedly for $6 million, and are spending
even more money to refurbish it.
   ``You gotta be a little bit nuts to live in New York,'' Willis
said, ``but there's no place like it that I've found.''
   Remarked Hanks: ``I think there's accuracy in our depiction of
New York City. It's not the be-all and end-all. There's a policeman
in the movie who says he works Bruckner Avenue (in the Bronx) and
Park Avenue (in Manhattan), and there's good and bad in both
places.
   ``I think this movie is seeing much more of the bad in both
places. But not just for New York City but American society as a
whole, I think there is truth to be found in our depiction of the
political system, the justice system, the clergy, the economic
system, race relations, the media.''
   De Palma, who has lived in New York for several years,
commented: ``When you're shooting New York City, you've got to
avoid all the cliches. When you're trying to deal with a comic,
styled land of the rich and famous, you've got to find images that
embody that. ... We took on a kind of comic stylization.
   ``The world depicted in `Bonire' is very true to these
particular characters building a huge case on another character's
fall.''
   If New York takes its lumps in ``Bonfire of the Vanities,'' the
media is savaged. Willis' scandal-sheet reporter manufactures his
stories.
   Has Willis been the victim of such fabrication?
   ``Many times,'' he said sadly. ``I had it happen three or four
times this past summer. When I was in Rome, there were three or
four stories written that were entirely fictional. They must have
included 25 quotes from me, from my wife, from two of my co-stars.
Not one word of it was true.''
   After five years of such treatment, Willis has learned to stay
cool: ``I can't stop these things, I can only control my reactions.
Occasionally, like now, I can express my feelings. Otherwise, I
just accept it as part of the entertainment business.''
   Hanks maintained that the swarming reporters and camera people
of ``Bonfire'' are not exaggerated: ``To anyone who has come out of
a courtroom after being convicted or acquitted, it's an
intimidating process.''
   Hanks has mostly escaped the scandal peddlers: ``I've been there
a couple of times, but I'm just not the fodder, not as
interesting.''

<HEAD>Slow Hurting of Chernobyl Children Evokes Christian Help</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gradually now comes the hurt to the children of Chernobyl. As
the silent, hidden blight starts appearing, they're beginning to
get help from scattered groups of American Christians.
   ``The situation is bad, and it's going to get worse,'' said the
Rev. Paul S. Moore, whose New York City radio ministry, CitiHope,
is raising money for medical supplies.
   ``In a real way, it means giving children back their lives,'' he
said.
   A threatening shadow fell over inhabitants of the Ukraine and
Byelorussia after the fiery rupture of a Soviet nuclear plant on
April 26, 1986, at Chernobyl filled the atmosphere with radioactive
particles.
   But only lately has the extent of the effects of that accident
begun to appear, with the impact increasing with time.
   Pyotr K. Kravchanka, foreign affairs minister of the
Byelorussian republic on which 70 percent of the contamination
settled, said that at the outset the resulting volume of cancer and
related cases could not be predicted.
   ``We are now seeing only the beginning stage,'' he said in an
interview, citing a doubling of thyroid ailments among children, a
sevenfold increase in anemia cases and a rise in leukemia cases.
   ``The peak volume of sickness has not yet come,'' he said.
Scientists project the mounting toll will hit its high point in
1996-97, he said, but treatment is severely limited by a lack of
medicine and diagnostic equipment.
   A fifth of Byelorussia's population, or 2.2 million people,
including 800,000 children, ``have become innocent victims of
Chernobyl,'' the ``hostages of postponed effects of radiation,'' he
told the United Nations General Assembly.
   As the disaster's effects grow, several small, independent
American religious and other groups, as well as ethnic communities
of Byelorussians and Ukrainians in some cities, have begun limited
steps to provide medical aid.
   A catalyzing influence for such efforts resulted from Moore's
visit in September to Minsk, capital of Byelorussia, where he
observed firsthand the spreading marks of radiation to which
children are most vulnerable.
   ``You can't realize the gravity of it until you experience it,
until flesh touches your flesh and you go through the hospitals
with the doctors and see the wasting bodies of the children,'' he
said. ``Most Americans are not aware of the extent of the
implications now and in the future.''
   He said he was told 37,000 Byelorussian children are being
treated for pre-cancerous conditions, with more cases diagnosed
daily. But, he added, the supply of medicine is so inadequate that
only 15 percent can be saved, compared to the 85 percent who could
be saved with sufficient medicine.
   Soviet pharmaceutical supplies, limited and chiefly from East
Germany, were said to have been disrupted by German reunification.
   Moore, also an assistant minister at St. George's Church in
Manhattan, said that through sponsorships enlisted on his radio
ministry, his project so far has supplied $650,000 worth of
methotrexate and other anti-cancer drugs and vitamins.
   He said that as a result, treatment has been started on 400
Byelorussian children, and that by early January, he expects to
have rounded up enough medicine to increase that number to 1,000.
   Moore said pharmaceutical companies will provide the drugs for
such charitable purposes at 5 percent of costs, meaning that the
usual cost of $4,000 to $5,000 for two or three years of treatment
to bring a cancerous condition into remission is reduced to $100 to
$200 per child.
   The Rev. Michael Christensen of San Francisco's Hamilton United
Methodist Church is coordinator of Moore's expanding project.
   Paul Maxey, associate executive director of Interchurch Medical
Assistance of New Windsor, Md., which serves 15 relief agencies as
a liaison with drug companies in obtaining medicines for such
causes, said:
   ``Reaction to the Chernobyl situation has been slow because of
the incubation time before the effects show up. Churches have not
been challenged to do much about it. But it has now become a very
distressing problem.''
   He said a few, mostly local groups now are getting involved.
   In Richmond, Va., the Rev. Paul F. McCleary, director of the
Christian Children's Fund, said his group began sending aid to the
Soviets as a result of a fact-finding trip with a Virginia medical
team to Minsk in mid-November.
   ``It's a very grave situation,'' he said, adding that a
pre-Christmas shipment of medicine was being assembled.
   ``It's a very large medical catastrophe and assistance is needed
to improve the diagnosis process and start treatment earlier,'' he
said.
   ``It's the first instance of a major nuclear catastrophe,
something entirely new in the human experience. It's important that
we monitor it and track the record so if another such event occurs
we cope with it more properly.
   ``It's a very significant activity for us and all mankind.''

   A Christmas Eve telecast involving troops in the
Persian Gulf area, ``Christmas with the Gulf,'' is to be presented
by the Vision Interfaith Satellite Network.
   It said the exclusive program, linking soliders in Bahrain with
families gathered at designated churches in England and Germany,
was being made available to all cable television systems in the
United States, whether or not they are affiliated with VISN.
   Jeffrey C. Weber, programming and operations vice president,
said the hour-long special, co-produced with the British
Broadcasting Corporation, is to be presented by VISN at 10 p.m. EST
Christmas Eve and will be repeated at 1:30 p.m. EST on Christmas
Day.
   The network is owned and operated by the not-for-profit National
Interfaith Cable Coalition, made up of 23 Roman Catholic, Jewish,
Protestant and Eastern Orthodox faith groups.

   DAYTON, Ohio (AP) - United Methodists on the average are older
and better educated than Americans as a whole, and a majority of
them at one time have been affiliated with another denomination, a
survey found.
   Responses from 758 lay members and 1,003 clergy showed 37.6
percent of the lay members and 50 percent of the clergy were older
than 50, compared to 25.7 percent for the entire country.
   For lay members, 49.9 percent had completed at least four years
of college, while 92.9 percent of the clergy had done so. That
compared to 20.3 percent of the U.S. population.

   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) - The leadership council of the
Sisters of Mercy criticized the U.S. military buildup in the
Persian Gulf as wasting human and material resources on a
``primitive method of conflict resolution.''
   At a meeting, the Roman Catholic order's council added: ``This
expense is especially deplorable at a time when we, along with
others committed to education, health care and social welfare, are
struggling and often failing to find the means of providing these
basic human rights for an increasing number of people.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - Reform Jewish leaders say the National Council
of Churches ``caused us great pain'' by a statement equating Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait with Israel's relationship with Palestinians.
   This ``plays into the hands of Saddam Hussein and his effort to
escape responsibility for the rape of Kuwait,'' the interreligious
affairs committee of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations
said in an open letter.

   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) - At the request of Soviet television
officials, the Christian Broadcasting Network is providing 27
regional networks there with a 30-minute special on the meaning of
Christmas.
   Michael Little, a CBN vice president, said Soviet officials
asked for the special on the historical, biblical aspect of
Christ's birth ``to explain to their Soviet auidience what
Christmas is all about.''
   The host of the show will be CBN's founder and president, Pat
Robertson.
   He said that the Soviet networks also will broadcast another CBN
special, ``Don't Ask Me, Ask God,'' in January and that a CBN
animated Bible series, ``Superbook,'' currently airs weekly in the
Soviet.
   ``I'm frankly overwhelmed by the unbelievable spiritual hunger
that exists in the Soviet Union,'' Robertson said, adding: ``In my
wildest dreams I could not have conceived of the magnitude of the
opportunity that has been presented to us.''

Carolina National Guard as its men trained and deployed for Saudi
Arabia. In this story, he looks at how their families are coping in
their absence.

   Ashley Deloach didn't hesitate when the teacher asked her class
to draw what they wanted for Christmas. The 6-year-old drew a
picture of her father, Sgt. Earnest Deloach.
   Spec. Don Graham is constantly on the mind of his 4-year-old
daughter Crystal. ``She asks all the time when is he coming home,''
said her mother, Rebecca. ``She still doesn't understand. She
thinks her daddy's at the armory.''
   Deloach and Graham are among the 14 members of the 26th
Quartermaster Detachment that left the Allendale, S.C., armory for
Saudi Arabia nearly four months ago. In that time, Deloach's two
children had birthdays, the car's transmission has started to leak,
and the checkbook balks at balancing. And now Christmas.
   ``I miss him terrible,'' said his wife, Lillie.
   Life has settled in for the families of the 265th since August,
when the water purification unit got a big sendoff from Allendale
City Hall.
   They were the first South Carolina National Guard detachment to
deploy to Saudi Arabia. Now, another 328 state guardsmen are in
Saudi Arabia, including 22 men with another Allendale unit that
left last week. Another 2,000 guardsmen are in some stage of
preparedness.
   ``You run into other people who say, `Hey, I've got someone over
there, too,''' said Ima Jean Rooker, whose 20-year-old son Mark is
the youngest member of the 265th. ``It's just growing into one big
family.''
   The 265th families are the seasoned veterans of the homefront,
each with stories about missed birthdays and anniversaries, the
treacheries of the family car, the vagaries of military mails and
the joy of unexpected phone calls from Saudi Arabia.
   ``I'm just managing until he's home,'' said Joanne Badger, who
has had to cope with the absence of her husband, Willie. ``It's
hard.''
   Harder still on Christmas, a time when the close-knit families
of the small town are used to big celebrations.
   ``It's going to be a real quiet holiday,'' said Clevetta
Jackson, wife of the 265th's commander, Sgt. Ronnie Jackson. ``We
didn't even bother to put up a tree. We usually make a big thing
about that.''
   This is the first time in 20 years the mother of two has missed
a Christmas with her husband, a forceful man who uses the word
``damn'' like a punctuation mark.
   ``We used to complain about him being so loud,'' she said. ``Now
it's so quiet around here we can hardly stand it.''
   Adele Harris will go to traditional dinner at her father's
house, where several clans gather for the day. But two important
faces will be missing: her husband, Henry, a retired schoolteacher,
and her brother Don Graham, a construction supervisor with seven
children. Both are in the 265th.
   ``Everybody's trying to keep their chin up,'' she said.
   The 265th's families have filled the time with a new routine:
mailing off letters and packages, and waiting in return for the
letters and occasional phone calls from the men.
   The gifts that went out from the Allendale homes illustrate the
hardships of life in the desert. Mrs. Rooker sent her son socks and
long underwear to cut the chill of the desert at night. He also got
a pillow, his art pad and a Christmas tree. Mrs. Badger sent canned
food to break the monotony of Army chow. Everybody included
Christmas cookies and candies with the usual batteries, newspapers
and magazines.
   While most of the wives write several times a week, they also
send videocassettes documenting sports and family events the men
have missed. The tapes are viewed by the men in a desert tent
equipped with a videotape recorder hooked to a generator.
   Estella Cohen sent her husband, Sgt. Hullie Cohen, a tape of
their son playing football for The Citadel. Other family members
produced a Christmas video complete with carols, Santa Claus and a
warning from Mrs. Harris that her husband would face the wrath of
Santa Claus if he didn't write.
   ``We sang `Rudolph' and `Silver Bells,' '' she said. ``We didn't
do, ``I'll Be Home for Christmas.'''
   Communication between the desert and the homefront has improved
in the last few months. Letters sometimes arrive within a week; the
men have been able to call with some regularity.
   ``The first thing he says is he's ready to come home,'' said
Mrs. Cohen. ``He said, `When I first left I was strong, but now I'm
ready to come home.'''
   The homecoming is a major focus of the families. Plans already
are being laid for a party that will include the one thing foremost
on the men's minds: beer.
   ``We'll have plenty of it at the party, but they might be too
tired to drink it,'' Mrs. Badger said.
   The 265th originally was called up for three months. The call-up
was extended another three months in November, which would mean a
homecoming in February. That could change if the United States goes
to war.
   The families prefer to believe they will see their men in two
months, rather than allowing their emotions to be roiled by the
daily bulletins from Baghdad and Washington.
   ``Some would say they've got a job to do and it's in the Lord's
hands,'' said Mrs. Rooker. ``It still doesn't keep me from this
deep feeling in my heart that Mark has to come back.
   ``At times it gets to you and you have to let it go. Once you

   The aroma of Southern fried chicken and
the strains of ``Dixie'' fill the air. A Confederate flag flutters
in a warm breeze.
   Young women in colorful hoop skirts square-dance with partners
dressed in the gray uniforms of the Confederacy.
   Welcome to Americana, where descendants of Rebels who fled the
United States after the Civil War hold an annual picnic to keep
some of their traditions alive - even though most of them don't
speak English.
   Memories of the Rebel past remain strong in this fertile
sugar-cane region 85 miles northwest of Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest
city.
   In a graveyard at nearby Santa Barbara D'Oeste, about 400
Confederate settlers and some of their offspring are buried in the
shade of pine, eucalyptus, mango and palm trees.
   Among them is the great-uncle of Rosalynn Carter, wife of former
President Carter. His epitaph reads:
   ``To the Memory of W.S. Wise. Born in Edgefield, South Carolina,
Oct. 13, 1833. Died in Santa Barbara, Brazil, April 14, 1877.''
   An inscription on another tombstone captures the defiance of
those who came to Brazil:
   ``Roberto Stell Steagall - Once a Rebel, Twice a Rebel and
Forever a Rebel. Born Sept. 1899. Died Jan. 1985.''
   Steagall's paternal grandfather, Henry Farrar Steagall, was a
Texan who served in Gen. Robert E. Lee's army and arrived in Brazil
in 1866.
   ``Wherever our ancestors settled, they were warmly welcomed,
except at the local cemetery,'' said Judith MacKnight Jones, 75,
the community's unofficial historian. She is one of the few who
speaks English, complete with a drawl.
   ``They were not allowed to bury their dead in the Roman Catholic
cemeteries because they were all Protestants, so they built this
one, which also serves as a monmument to our heritage,'' Mrs. Jones
said, pointing to a concrete obelisk with four Confederate flags
engraved on it.
   Sitting at a picnic table watching the square dance was Sydney
Mills, a large man in a cowboy hat, boots and leather vest, who
carried a riding crop. Mills, 73, is nicknamed ``The Texan.''
   ``I've been dressing like this for more than 30 years as a way
to pay homage to my Confederate ancestors,'' Mills said in
Portuguese. His grandfather, William Thatcher Mills, came from
Dallas in 1866 to plant cotton in Santa Barbara D'Oeste.
   Like Mills, most of the descendants know little of their family
histories.
   About 3,500 Southerners arrived between 1866 and 1890 to settle
this southeastern region, where the climate and soil are similar to
the southeastern United States. They introduced cotton, the metal
plow and the sewing machine.
   Many settlers could not adapt and nearly 3,000 returned to the
United States by the turn of the century, Mrs. Jones said.
   Most of the immigrants eventually moved to Americana, which grew
up around the region's first railroad station, built in 1875. The
city now is known for textile mills.
   Today, Mrs. Jones said, no more than 300 of the people living in
or near this city of 160,000 can trace their ancestry directly to
Confederate immigrants.
   The total number of descendants in Brazil is difficult to gauge,
Some probably are unaware of their Confederate ancestry, others
went elsewhere and there is no record of their numbers.
   In 1967, Mrs. Jones chronicled the Confederate immigration in
the book ``Soldier Rest, A North American Epic Under Brazilian
Skies.'' She wrote it in Portuguese, but hopes for an English
translation.
   Most of the Civil War exiles were plantation owners, she said,
but the group included teachers, doctors, lawyers, businessmen and
adventurers.
   ``They came from all over the South: Alabama, Georgia, Texas,
South Carolina and Mississippi,'' she said in an interview. ``They
all felt conditions under Reconstruction would be unbearable, so
they decided to leave the old South and head for Brazil.''
   The first immigrants arrived in 1866, drawn by reports from
American Protestant missionaries and the Brazilian government that
their knowledge of cotton farming was needed.
   Another attraction was the abundant slave labor available in
Brazil, Mrs. Jones said. Slavery was not abolished in Brazil until
1888.
   Initially, the transplanted Americans did not mix with the local
residents. Integration and intermarriage with Brazilians was
frowned upon.
   ``They had their own teachers, doctors, preachers and language
to protect their values from outside influences,'' Mrs. Jones said.
   The self-imposed segregation began crumbling in the early 1900s.
Grandchildren of the settlers married outside the community and
began to mix with Brazilian culture.
   Besides the yearly picnic, about 60 descendants meet every three
months to keep in touch and exchange information on their
ancestors.

   ``George, what should I do? Should I make this gangster movie or
shouldn't I?'' - Francis Ford Coppola, speaking to George Lucas in
1970.

   Francis Ford Coppola is working around the
clock, pushing himself and his editors to get the latest
``Godfather'' film into theaters by Christmas. He insists a spring
release would be better, but Paramount Pictures, eyeing the
deadline for the Academy Awards, wants it out before the end of the
year.
   The movie is screened in San Francisco and the projector breaks
down four times. Four days later, when the film is seen in Seattle,
several scenes have been cut and many others added. Audience
response is mixed.
   The time is December 1974, and as a weary assistant gazes at a
preview card, he lets out an audible groan, ``I hope there will be
no `Godfather, Part III.''' Responds the director, ``So do I.''
   But it's happening again, Coppola frantically editing, Paramount
executives nervously waiting, stories about on-set blowups and
last-minute switches,endless curiosity over this most lavish of
Christmas presents.
   A new ``Godfather'' film is Hollywood's equivalent to a world
tour by the Rolling Stones, and its aura of money and power is
something the Corleones would have appreciated. The two
``Godfather'' movies have grossed $800 million and won nine Academy
Awards between them.
   But that's industry talk. To moviegoers, ``The Godfather'' means
Brando and Duvall, Pacino and De Niro; a bloodied horse head and a
brotherly kiss on New Year's Eve; weddings and christenings; death
in a tomato garden; bullets ripping through James Caan at a toll
booth.
   To the artists, it means fame, revitalized careers. Marlon
Brando was washed up. Al Pacino was an unknown stage performer.
Coppola was a failed director hired because he'd work cheap.
   The stakes for ``The Godfather, Part III'' are enormous. The
budget reportedly topped $50 million, and a flop could spell
financial ruin for Coppola. He and his production company filed for
bankruptcy protection from creditors during shooting, listing
assets of $22.2 million and debts of $28.9 million.
   Also, Paramount has struggled this year. ``Ghost'' was an
enormous hit, but both ``The Two Jakes'' and ``Another 48 HRS.''
flopped. If critics don't take to the new ``Godfather,'' the studio
could be shut out from the Academy Awards, as it just was by the
New York and Los Angeles Film Critics associations, which both
named another Mafia movie, ``GoodFellas,'' as best picture.
   Coppola has compared the Corleones to the Kennedys, tragic
American dynasties. People care about Vito, Sonny, Michael and
Connie.
   Mario Puzo's ``The Godfather'' came out in 1969 to mixed
reviews, and with complaints from the Italian-American Civil Rights
League that the book reinforced stereotypes.
   But the novel quickly topped The New York Times' best-seller
list, and within two years of its first printing, 10 million copies
had been purchased. Puzo, the son of illiterate Italian immigrants,
sold the film rights to Paramount for $85,000.
   ---
   ``Coppola, oh yeah, let me tell you something about Coppola.
Coppola would make a great producer - you know he's a hustler, he's
got all this talk and cha-cha-cha, but he's no director.'' -
Producer Albert Ruddy, before making ``The Godfather.''
   ---
   Paramount wanted a low-budget film, an easy profit-maker, and
envisioned a Christmas 1971 release. Ruddy, who had worked on TV's
``Hogan's Heroes,'' was assigned to produce. For director, he
sought Peter Yates (``Bullitt''), who declined, and then
Costa-Gavras (``Z''), who also said no.
   Ruddy then called on Coppola, a 32-year-old director whose last
two films had bombed. Paramount, burned by such big-budget failures
as ``Catch 22'' and ``Paint Your Wagon,'' needed someone it could
control. Also, as Ruddy noted, Coppola was an Italian who ``knew
the way these men ate their food, kissed each other, talked.''
   Coppola, deeply in debt, reluctantly accepted. The budget was to
come in under $2 million.
   ---
   ``I assure you that Marlon Brando will never appear in this
film.'' - Paramount President Stanley Jaffe.
   ---
   Puzo and Coppola worked on a screenplay and the director began
casting. Caan, an old friend of Coppola's who had appeared in the
director's ``The Rain People,'' was quickly chosen to play Sonny
Corleone. Robert Duvall, also in ``The Rain People,'' was an easy
choice for ``consigliere'' Tom Hagen.
   For Michael Corleone, Paramount insisted on a star, preferably
Robert Redford or Warren Beatty. Coppola had his eyes on Al Pacino,
an off-Broadway actor of Silician descent. The studio objected.
Pacino's screen tests were poor. He was too short, too
inexperienced and, ironically, looked too Italian. But the director
wouldn't budge and Paramount, anxious to get shooting under way,
gave in.
   The casting of family patriarch Vito Corleone could only be
compared to finding the perfect Scarlett. Coppola interviewed every
old Italian actor he could find: No one was good enough.
   Age, Ruddy and Coppola decided, didn't matter. They simply
needed a great actor. They considered Sir Laurence Olivier, but he
was too ill. They also considered Brando, who Puzo had in mind when
he wrote the character.
   The brooding star of ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' and ``On the
Waterfront'' was then 47 and better at emptying studio coffers than
filling them. It had been years since he had had a hit, and budgets
had soared for his last movies reportedly because of on-set battles
between Brando and his directors.
   Executives wanted nothing to do with him. Coppola persisted.
Paramount agreed to give him a chance, but set three conditions:
One, Brando would receive no salary, only a percentage; two, the
actor had to guarantee, with his own money, that he would not cause
the film to go over budget; three, he would have to take a screen
test, something he was as likely to do as submit to an interview.
   Brando agreed to all three. For his screen test, the actor put
on a fake mustache, slicked back his hair with shoe polish and
stuffed Kleenex in his mouth. He got the part.
   Some Italian actors protested the casting of non-Italians
Brando, Caan and Duvall, and the IACRL proved as demanding as
Paramount. It staged a rally, hosted by Frank Sinatra, at Madison
Square Garden to raise funds to stop the film, threatened labor
disruptions on the set and insisted there was no such thing as the
Mafia.
   Ruddy promised to keep the words ``Mafia'' and ``Cosa Nostra''
out of the film. (The words are back in for ``The Godfather, Part
III.'') He also agreed to attend a testimonial dinner, hire league
members as bit players and extras and donate New York's
opening-night box office to the league's hospital fund.
   With publicity building and Coppola's wheels turning, the budget
was increased to $6.2 million.

   Filming started March 29, 1971. Coppola had requested an 80-day
shooting schedule, but Paramount would only give him 53. With time
so short, scenes were rushed and the dailies came out poorly. It
was rumored Coppola would be replaced by Elia Kazan, who had twice
directed Brando. The actor helped put an end to such talk by
insisting he would stop working if Coppola was fired.
   Director of photography Gordon Willis, frustrated with Coppola's
inexperience, walked off the set at one point. Crew members mocked
Talia Shire, Coppola's sister, as incompetent. The director's
obsession with retakes drove everyone crazy and a rebellious
Paramount editor was fired.
   ``At first everybody was so uptight. Francis was a wreck and
Pacino looked like he was going to die,'' said Caan, who helped
lighten the mood by cracking jokes with Duvall and mooning Brando
on the set.
   Shooting fell behind schedule and the release date was pushed
back to Easter 1972. The final budget approached $7 million.
   The finished movie ran for three hours and stayed that way
despite complaints from the studio. It was first seen in late
February, and most exhibitors who saw it were unimpressed.
   On March 11, 1972, ``The Godfather'' opened in New York and all
was forgiven. Critics raved and fans poured in. There were
``Godfather'' games and ``Godfather'' soundtracks. Shouts of ``make
him an offer you can't refuse,'' the Corleone way of doing
business, were heard from playgrounds to advertising offices.
   It was one of those rare films in which every shot seemed to
have been lovingly crafted, the simplest dialogue took on
additional meaning and even the most minor character had depth and
personality.
   Brando had the most memorable role, but Pacino's Michael was the
center of the movie. All the horror and beauty of ``The Godfather''
can be seen in his transformation from an awkward college graduate
to a cool, ruthless mob boss, becoming more confident and skillful
on the outside as his soul burns inside.
   Michael Corleone is one of Hollywood's great tragic figures, his
rise and fall comparable to Orson Welles' Charles Foster Kane in
``Citizen Kane'' and Broderick Crawford's Willie Stark in ``All the
King's Men.''
   And, like ``The Maltese Falcon,'' ``The Godfather'' had plenty
to say about the stuff that dreams are made of. The film's final
shot, a door closing on Diane Keaton as Pacino and associates
scheme for the future, recalls the conclusion of ``The Maltese
Falcon,'' a closeup of elevator doors closing on Mary Astor as the
police take her away.
   The following March, Brando won an Oscar for best actor, and the
movie won best picture and best screenplay. Four months later,
Paramount announced a sequel with Coppola to write and direct.
   ``The Godfather, Part II'' alternates between chronicling Vito's
early years and Michael in middle age. Pacino, Duvall, Keaton and
Shire returned. Caan, who had been murdered in the first film,
appeared in a flashback sequence. Brando was not in the sequel.
Paramount was furious at him for turning down the Oscar in protest
of Hollywood's treatment of American Indians, and the two sides
couldn't agree to terms.
   To play the young Vito Corleone, Coppola selected Robert De
Niro, who had attracted considerable attention for his role as a
dying baseball player in ``Bang the Drum Slowly.'' Willis,
apparently thinking more highly of the director, was behind the
cameras.
   Shooting began in September 1973 and dragged on for eight
months. The budget was a cool $13 million, more than double what it
was supposed to cost.
   ---
   ``My father assured him either his brains or his signature would
be on the contract.'' - Michael Corleone, explaining how Vito
helped a singer to get a nightclub owner to release him from a
contract.
   ---
   ``The Godfather, Part II,'' another three-hour job, was released
in December, and reviews were mixed.
   Still, interest was strong enough to bring in millions at the
box office, and six Oscars, including best film, best director,
best screenplay, best supporting actor (De Niro) and best score to
Coppola's father, Carmine.
   Paramount was already considering the next ``Godfather'' film,
with or without the troublesome director.
   While Coppola floundered, churning out such flops as ``Rumble
Fish'' and ``One From the Heart,'' the studio plotted. In 1977,
Charles Bludhorn, chairman of Gulf &amp; Western Industries
(Paramount's parent company), met with director Richard Brooks
(``Blackboard Jungle'') and gave him a 53-page treatment for ``The
Godfather ... III.'' Brooks wasn't interested.
   Bludhorn collaborated on a script with Puzo. Novelist Vincent
Patrick, who wrote ``The Pope of Greenwich Village'' and Dean
Reisner of ``Dirty Harry'' fame took a shot at it. John Travolta
was going to star, or maybe Sylvester Stallone.
   In 1988, rumors circulated that Coppola was in Italy, working on
- could it be? - ``The Godfather, Part III.'' A year later, they
were confirmed. Coppola was back, so were Pacino, Keaton and Shire.
Willis was there, too, as was Carmine Coppola for the score.
   ---
   ``I could make five failures, five pictures nobody liked, and
I'd still be the guy who directed ``The Godfather.'' - Francis Ford
Coppola.
   ---
   Andy Garcia, who plays Sonny's out-of-wedlock son, seem the
best bet to come out a winner with the new movie, to do a
``Pacino'' and become a major star. Pacino and Keaton are
established actors re-enacting familiar roles.
   Sofia Coppola, the director's daughter, is a risk. An
inexperienced actress, she was a last-minute substitute for Winona
Ryder and has a key role as Michael's daughter and Garcia's love
interest. So far, reaction to her performance has been negative.
   Then, there's the director himself. Beyond all the talk of money
and awards, the saga of the Corleones is also the saga of Coppola.
``The Godfather'' is an accidental classic. But was that film just
a fluke for Coppola? Does he have anything left to say about the
Corleones?
   ``The artist's worst fear is that he'll be exposed as a sham,''
Coppola said back in 1975. ``I've heard it from actors, directors,
everyone. ... Deep down we're all living with the notion that our
success is beyond our ability.''

   The movie event of the year, ``The Godfather
Part III,'' hits the nation's screens on Christmas Day with the
expectation that Francis Ford Coppola will again prove godfather to
actors' careers.
   He did it with the first two sagas of the Corleone family,
restoring Marlon Brando to greatness and establishing Al Pacino and
Robert De Niro as superstars.
   The obvious candidate for the bigtime from the new film is Andy
Garcia, who plays Sonny Corleone's out-of-wedlock son. He has
already delivered strong supporting performances in ``The
Untouchables,'' ``Black Rain'' and ``Internal Affairs.'' Previewers
of ``Godfather III'' seem to agree that Garcia has arrived.
   There was less agreement about Sofia Coppola, as Mary Corleone,
the don's daughter. When Winona Ryder was unable to fulfill the
role, Coppola made the controversial casting of his own daughter.
Her only previous acting came in her father's films. Early reaction
has been fairly negative for Sofia, some of whose lines had to be
relooped because of her ``Valley Girl'' voice.
   Most of the cast are alumni of the previous ``Godfathers'' -
Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire - or established character actors
such as Eli Wallach, Joe Montegna, Raf Vallone, Helmut Berger. The
new film could revive the career of George Hamilton, and boost
Brigid Fonda and Franc D'Ambrosio, the opera singer making his film
debut as Pacino's son.
   ``The Godfather'' was a 1972 phenomenon, not only because it
amassed more money than any previous film, but also for its
starmaking capacities. Pacino, who had made only one previous film,
``Panic in Needle Park,'' became an immediate star. The same was
true with Diane Keaton, in her second film after ``Looking for Mr.
Goodbar.''
   Robert Duvall had been playing smaller roles since ``To Kill a
Mockingbird'' in 1964. His role as the consigliere elevated him to
stardom. Both Keaton and Duvall went on to win Academy Awards.
James Caan was already a popular actor, but his role as the
hot-headed Sonny Corleone in the first two films provided a big
boost.
   Coppola's sister, Talia Shire, might be called the queen of the
sequels. She has appeared in all three ``Godfathers'' as the
Corleone daughter, and as Rocky Balboa's wife in the five
``Rockys.''
   ``The Godfather Part II'' brought Robert De Niro the Oscar as
supporting actor and broadened a career that appeared stuck in
small-budget crime movies. The film also initiated an acting career
for the legendary acting teacher Lee Strasberg. John Cazale
returned as Fredo, the weak member of the Corleone family. His
career was cut short by cancer.
   Among the other ``Godfather'' actors who have died: Strasberg,
Sterling Hayden, Richard Castellano, John Marley, Richard Conte.
   Besides Pacino, Keaton and Shire, Richard Bright has appeared in
all three films, as the henchman Al Neri. Al Martino skipped No. II
but returns in ``The Godfather Part III'' as the flamboyant crooner
Johnny Fontane.

   The car waited for Kevin Brown, its motor
idling. Inside, the heater blasted warm, seductive air. The car was
there to take him to a home with real walls and real doors, to a
room of his own, to a new life - or a chance to reclaim his old
one.
   For the past year, Brown had lived under a highway, in a box
fashioned of cardboard and plywood. This was the day he'd been
waiting for - moving day.
   The slide into homelessness has been well-chronicled, but
advocates for the homeless say there's a less-told story: the
struggle to get off the street. And Kevin Brown had made it.
   But outside the car, with the temperature just above freezing,
his 29-year-old girlfriend Pat sat in the darkness next to the box
that had been their shared home for eight months. She sobbed,
hunched over, rocking ever so slightly, and feverishly sucked her
thumb.
   Pat was the only thing keeping Brown from spending his first
night indoors in more than a year, from taking a hot bath, from
being able to shut a door - an act so simple, but one he
desperately craved.
   Because she had left her home to live with him, Brown said he
felt responsible for Pat, who declined to give her last name.
   If they were to be separated - he going to the residence to
which he had been struggling to gain admission and she to a women's
shelter - he first wanted to make sure she was safe.
   But when she refused to go, he became resolute about leaving.
   ``I'm not going to pass up this opportunity,'' said Brown, 28.
``I been homeless way before she even thought about being homeless.
Now is my big chance ... She can't stop it! She can't stop it!''
   He bolted from the station wagon and ran into the thicket of
boxes, tarps and lean-tos along the Hudson River that are home to
about 15 people on an abandoned stretch of road under the West Side
Highway.
   ``I think he's tired,'' said Jonnie Scott, one of three city
social workers inside the car. ``He's tired, and he wants to change
his life. He wants to be somebody.''
   ---
   Advocates for the homeless say one of the biggest problems
confronting those who want to find a permanent place to live is the
tremendous amount of sophisticated bureaucratic maneuvering
required by government agencies.
   The system, they argue, forces people already overloaded with
problems to submit applications, fill out forms, make follow-up
phone calls and have patience and faith in a process that requires
large amounts of both.
   ``It's an absolute act of heroism that someone is able to get
out of a box,'' said Carol Fennelly, spokeswoman for the Community
for Creative Non-Violence in Washington, D.C., founded by the late
Mitch Snyder. It shelters about 1,400 men, women and families.
   ``They have such a hard time getting back to a regular place
because they have no place to take showers, no place to get mail,
no place to get phone calls,'' she said.
   But the bureaucracy is necessary to ensure the homeless are sent
to the right shelter or home, said Ray Diaz, deputy commissioner of
Special Services for Adults in New York, whose various agencies
decide the fates of people like Brown.
   Brown, a former construction worker who once earned $22 an hour,
was homeless for a year, after spending his rent money on his
cocaine addiction. His quest to get into Rena's Residence for
Adults began in June, when he happened to walk by the home and
spotted a sign in the window.
   The Harlem residence is funded by the city and state and can
accommodate 99 men and women. The city's Human Resources
Administration governs who is admitted, which means that once
Rena's recommends a candidate, the person's file must be submitted
to the labyrinthine city bureaucracy.
   Brown said he made five visits over the course of getting his
application approved. Although he said he sometimes felt he was
getting the runaround, he was determined to be patient.
   ``I knew deep in my heart this is what I needed,'' Brown said,
``So I always just said, `OK, I can wait.'''
   Rena Chinhenzva, who runs the residence, says it targets those
looking for a permanent way out of homelessness and not just a warm
room for the night. She tries to help her residents enroll in
vocational schools or, if they want, get their high school
diplomas.
   ``We want to give them back their pride,'' Chinhenzva said.
   The problem of getting people off the streets and into a place
of their own is exacerbated by the public's increasing feelings of
futility over the issue of homelessness, said Gary Blasi, president
of the National Coalition for the Homeless and a Legal Aid
Foundation attorney in Los Angeles.
   ``There is just a certain level of weariness,'' Blasi said. ``If
people don't have a sense that things are getting better, after
awhile they just give up. And then they turn their attention to
things like Saudi Arabia.''
   So while troops mass in the hot desert sand, he said, more and
more men, women and children will be gathering on America's icy
sidewalks.
   ``The forecast for the homeless this winter is about as cold as
it ever has been,'' he said.
   ---
   Brown came back. And after about 20 minutes, Pat climbed into
the back of the car. She was sobbing and gasping convulsively, all
the while keeping her right thumb firmly planted in her mouth.
   ``I don't want to stay in a shelter,'' she said haltingly.
   Scott had gone for a walk with Pat and persuaded her to go to a
women's shelter, at least for the night, a particularly cold
mid-December evening; Pat had not submitted an application to
Rena's.
   One of the reasons Pat was so distraught, Brown said, was
because he had worked hard to make their makeshift home
comfortable.
   The box, about the size of a Volkswagen bus, was insulated by
used carpets thrown on top. Electricity tapped from a nearby
streetlight powered a black and white television, with a bulb
inside that created enough heat to keep them warm, Brown said.
   Meals were made over a hearth of cinderblocks. A nearby fire
hydrant offered running water, and they took sponge baths inside
the box. A bucket was their toilet. In an open-air area outside the
box sat a kitchen table decorated with a bouquet of wilted flowers
inside a juice jar.
   If it wasn't under a highway, it all might be considered cozy.

   Brown, a Queens native, said his family would have gladly taken
him in, and he did stay with them for awhile. But then he began to
feel he could conquer his drug problem only by himself, so he fled.
   Now, he was on his way back. One of the first things he planned
to do was call his family, he said. During his year of
homelessness, he wrote to them, but he never told them how he was
living.
   Brown loaded four suitcases and five trash bags full of clothes
and his and Pat's most valuable possessions into the car. He then
wedged himself into the back seat because Pat insisted on sitting
on his lap for the ride to the women's shelter.
   ``I'm not going to baby you!'' Brown told her. `` ... You better
straighten up, Pat. I told you a way long time ago that one day
this was going to happen.''
   At the shelter, there was little time to say goodbye. With a
brief hug, they parted.
   ``I feel great!'' Brown said as he walked briskly to the car,
waiting to take him to Rena's. ``I feel great!''
   After a weekend of solid sleep in a warm room, Brown said he was
setting his sights on the future again. He plans to enroll in a
vocational school, study building maintenance and get his high
school diploma.
   He also said he was looking forward to the coming Sunday, when
he would go to church for the first time in more than a year.
   ``I'm just going back to school and going back to the church,''
Brown said.
   And his new life at Rena's?
   ``I'm living in a dreamboat,'' he said with a hearty laugh.

<HEAD>Americans Deny Firsthand Knowledge of Homelessness</HEAD>

   Many Americans deny firsthand knowledge of
homelessness and blame it mainly on tough breaks or bad economic
luck, an Associated Press poll has found.
   A majority of the respondents, 54 percent, say their knowledge
of the homeless is based on news reports or word of mouth. Fewer
than half say their knowledge of the homeless is a result of
something they have seen or dealt with in person.
   Only 15 percent know someone who has become homeless in the last
year. That measure of Americans' scant firsthand knowledge of the
problem holds true for all income groups, and drops to 10 percent
in non-metropolitan areas and to 7 percent among Americans over 65.
   Yet polls over the years have shown Americans want the
government to do more to help the homeless. In January, for
example, a CBS News-New York Times poll found 71 percent saying the
Bush administration had not shown enough concern.
   In the current poll, 58 percent said federal spending on helping
the homeless should be increased. That is not a significant change
from the 60 percent who provided the same answer in a Media
General-Associated Press poll in November 1988.
   This time, 75 percent of those who wanted increased spending
said they would be willing to pay more taxes for it, compared with
86 percent two years ago.
   The overall acceptance rate for a tax increase to help the
homeless has dropped from 52 percent to 44 percent, perhaps because
of the economic downturn.
   One out of seven Americans rate as likely the chances that they
or a member of their family could become homeless in the coming
year. But only 4 percent rated it very likely and 67 percent rated
it not at all likely.
   The total answering very likely or somewhat likely was 19
percent in the South and West, compared with 5 percent in the
Northeast and 14 percent in the north-central states. It was 20
percent for women, compared with 9 percent for men.
   A gender gap also showed up in measuring attitudes toward the
homeless.
   Among men, 21 percent agreed that ``the homeless themselves are
mainly at fault becaue of their unwillingness to work or their
behavior, such as alcohol or drug use.'' Only 13 percent of the
women agreed, making the overall total 17 percent.
   Twenty percent of men and 21 percent of women agreed that ``our
society is mainly at fault because we do not provide sufficient
housing for them.''
   Thirty-eight percent of the men and 45 percent of the women said
a third statement best reflected their attitude: ``Neither the
homeless nor society is mainly at fault because they become
homeless through tough breaks or bad economic luck.''
   Overall, 41 percent agreed with the tough-luck explanation of
homelessness, while 17 percent volunteered the answer that both the
homeless and society are mainly at fault for the problem.
   The survey of 1,004 adults was conducted Dec. 5-9 by ICR Survey
Research Group of Media, Pa., part of AUS Consultant Cos.
   The poll used a random-sampling method that generally should
produce results accurate to within three percentage points. When
responses are broken down by age groups or income categories, the
margin of error increases as the subgroups get smaller.

<TEXT>
   The Associated Press poll on homelessness was
conducted by telephone Dec. 5-9 among a random sample of 1,004
adults in the contiguous United States. Interviewing was done by
ICR Survey Research Group of Media, Pa.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll had a three-point margin of sampling error,
meaning that 19 of 20 times its findings should be within three
points of the result if every adult American were asked the same
questions. The error margin is larger for subgroups.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this
poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. Is your knowledge of the homeless a result of something you
have seen or dealt with in person, or is it just based on news
reports and word of mouth? In person: 45 percent. Word of mouth: 54
percent. Don't know or no answer: 2 percent.
   2. Which of the following statements best reflects your attitude
toward the homeless in the United States today?
   - The homeless themselves are mainly at fault because of their
unwillingness to work or their behavior, such as alcohol or drug
use: 17 percent.
   - Our society is mainly at fault because we do not provide
sufficient housing for them: 20 percent.
   - Neither the homeless nor society is mainly at fault because
they become homeless through tough breaks or bad economic luck: 41
percent.
   - (volunteered answer) Combination of both homeless and society:
17 percent.
   - Don't know or no answer: 5 percent.
   3. Do you think federal spending on helping the homeless should
be increased, decreased, or remain the same? Increased: 58 percent.
Decreased: 7 percent. Remain the same: 23 percent. DK-NA: 12
percent.
   (For those who said increased) Would you be willing to pay more
taxes for that? Yes: 75 percent. No: 22 percent. DK-NA: 3 percent.
   4. I'm going to ask you to rate the chances that you or a member
of your family could become homeless in the coming year. Do you
personally feel the chances are ... Very likely: 4 percent.
Somewhat likely: 11 percent. Somewhat unlikely: 16 percent. Not at
all likely: 67 percent. DK-NA: 3 percent.
   5. Do you know someone who has become homeless in the last year?
Yes: 15 percent. No: 85 percent.

<HEAD>At 40, the Laugh Track's Still (Ha! Hahaha! Ahahaahaha... ha!)</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Man has been called the only animal that laughs;
television, the only machine. And 1990 was the year that ``canned
laughter,'' the use of prerecorded hilarity in the TV comedy sound
track, turned 40 years old.
   Like many 40-year-olds, the laugh track didn't need or want to
be reminded of its age, or that it first appeared on ``The Hank
McCune Show,'' an unremembered, filmed sitcom that made its debut
on NBC on Sept. 9, 1950.
   ``The Hank McCune Show'' was about an amiable bumbler who
created chaos wherever he went. Its home audience, seated at the
electronic hearth, heard the unmistakable sound of an audience's
laughter if they noticed it at all.
   All was not what it seemed.
   The show, noted the trade newspaper Variety, ``has an innovation
in a sound track that contains audience laughter. Although the show
is lensed on film without a studio audience, there are chuckles and
yocks dubbed in.
   ``Whether this induces a jovial mood in home viewers is still to
be determined, but the practice may have unlimited possibilities if
it's spread to include canned peals of hilarity, thunderous
ovations and gasps of sympathy.''
   And spread it has. To the early producers, the laugh track
seemed as reasonable as the ``claque'' - paid applauders who pack a
theater to heat up an audience's response to the show.
   Radio comedies had never had that problem. Their actors usually
were big stars who performed at microphones on bare stages in front
of studio audiences that had come prepared to laugh.
   But producing filmed comedy for the hungry new medium meant
using sound stages, where audiences could not fit. The laugh track
synthesized audience reaction and cued the audience - however
ungently - when something was funny.
   ``If there's one basic truth in show biz,'' said Pat Weaver, the
then-president of NBC, ``the one basic truth is nobody knows what
the audience reaction is going to be to any project until it is
actually played.''
   Weaver said the laugh track was predicated on the psychological
fact that people are more inclined to laugh when they are ``among''
people who are laughing.
   ``Not that I was in favor of laugh tracks,'' Weaver added.``The
idiots that were running the programs all got carried away, even if
they were really good comedies,'' he said.
   ``I was in favor of a laugh track that was intelligently used,''
he said. ``That was the way it started and the way it should have
continued.''
   It didn't.
   Technology evolved to the post-production ``laugh machine,''
where a technician could mix the audible range of human reactions
from snort, chuckle and giggle to guffaw, belly laugh and roar into
an audience's silence.
   A skilled technician could play the laugh machine like a
musician, exhorting the ``canned peals of hilarity, thunderous
ovations and gasps of sympathy'' into a symphony of synthetic
response.
   ``The machine will love it'' and ``we'll fix it in post'' became
stock excuses for a gag that fell short or, worse, an unfunny
script.
   Even ``I Love Lucy,'' where Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz
virtually invented the three-camera sitcom filmed before a live
audience, ``sweetened'' its laugh track with canned yocks when the
audience got cold.
   ``There's no question that we have been conditioned to the sound
of laughter,'' said George Schlatter, executive producer of the
comedy series ``Laugh-In,'' which premiered in 1968. ``It's now a
science. You can't tell when it's a track.
   ``Whether that's improving the quality of television is the real
question - and I don't think so,'' he said.
   This from a man who once took a collection of political speeches
and dubbed laughs, music and applause under it. (``It was
wonderful. I was going to market it but my lawyers said they would
throw themselves under the car.'')
   ``Laugh-In'' was blisteringly paced, blackout comedy series that
redefined television comedy. It was filmed, for the most part,
before a studio audience, and it was the laugh track's finest hour.
   ``Because the bits were so short and we did so many of them .. .
in order to get more jokes per minute, we many times removed the
laughs,'' Schlatter said.
   ``On `Laugh-In,' electronic editing was perfected, because the
cuts were made so fast that we no longer could make physical
splices,'' he said. ``And me, with my perverse sense of humor, I'd
put in laughs where there were none.''
   James Komack, executive producer of the hit sitcom ``Welcome
Back, Kotter'' and many others, made sure each of his shows had a
different laugh track.
   ``With `The Courtship of Eddie's Father,' it was a very light
track, almost like music,'' Komack said. ``With `Chico and the Man'
and `Welcome Back, Kotter,' (both filmed before a studio audience)
most of the time what you heard was the laughter of the audience.''
   The exception is when the director cuts into a scene, forcing
the audio engineers to blend different sound tracks together. Using
laughter, rather than ambient noise, makes for a seamless
transition between different ``takes.''
   ``If you ever try to do a show without a laugh track, you'll see
a huge difference,'' Komack said. ``It flattens. The only way to
get away from a laugh track is to use music, which can indicate
when something is funny.''
   ``Sweetening'' is still employed on those days when a great
script and a hot cast collide with a cold audience, Komack said.
   ``Then it's determined by the taste of the producers - by the
morality of the producers,'' Komack said. ``After a while, you
learn that it's valueless. In the extremes, people are going to
hear it and say, `Why are they laughing?' and they'll turn off your
program.''
   Komack also cited his experience as an actor and writer in the
three-year run of Jackie Cooper's series ``Hennesey,'' which began
in 1959. In its third year on the air, Cooper decided to ax the
laugh track.
   ``It was a brave, artistic, very clever, very creative,
marvelous show - and it got canceled,'' Komack said.
   The critical question these days is whether a quality series can
survive without canned laughter. Critics loved recent, laugh
track-less shows like ``The `Slap' Maxwell Story'' and ``Frank's
Place,'' but the show didn't last.
   Apparently we Americans tend to get nervous if we sit alone with
the TV, laughing in the dark.
   As Schlatter put it: ``Genuine wit doesn't really need the
machine; the audience does.''
   And let the record reflect that ``The Hank McCune Show'' went
off the air just three months after its premiere.

   Anna Maria Horsford knew the role all too
well before she auditioned to play Veronica Perry, the mother of a
young black man killed by a New York policeman.
   The victim's mother and Miss Horsford were classmates in junior
high school. The actress' acquaintance with the Perry family led
her to reject the way her role had been drawn for the NBC movie
``Best Intentions: The Education and Killing of Edmund Perry,''
which will air in late January or early February.
   Perry, an honors graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy, was due to
attend Stanford University when he was shot to death June 12, 1985,
by an undercover policeman in New York's Morningside Park. The
policeman said Perry, 17, and his brother, Jonah, then 19, attacked
him and tried to rob him.
   Miss Horsford, who stars on NBC's ``Amen,'' attended Wadleigh
Junior High School in Harlem with Mrs. Perry. She had never met
Edmund, but knew of his educational promise. She also has been a
contributor to the Better Chance program that enabled Edmund to
attend the exclusive private school Phillips Exeter.
   ``I'd been keeping in touch through a teacher at Wadleigh,''
Miss Horsford said. ``I was so thrilled when Edmund was chosen for
the program. Veronica had two bright boys and a daughter in the
program. But knowing a person doesn't mean you know the inner
workings of the mind.
   ``Not until I got the script did I learn the details. She really
pushed her kids. She didn't ask what they wanted. That's no crime -
I'd probably do the same thing. I have a nephew in the program, and
I was pushing and my sister was pushing.''
   When Miss Horsford auditioned, it was suggested she play Mrs.
Perry like a stage mother.
   ``They didn't know at the time I knew her,'' she said. ``I
closed the script and said no. I said you can't say that about a
mother trying to teach her kids about racism. I said she was a
successful woman in her own right. What did I mean by that? I said
she had three children by the same man, her husband, and where I
come from that's success.
   ``There are so few roles that get to the depths of a woman,
especially a black woman. You don't see many of us on the screen. I
think you have an obligation to fill in all the strengths and all
the weaknesses. I don't care what the color is, we all have flaws.
   ``Many people don't know that what they're doing may not be seen
as correct. She pushed her children, but a mother wants the best
for her children. You have to see her life and goals through her
eyes.''
   Miss Horsford said that after she got the role, she was troubled
by doubts about the official version of the shooting.
   ``I didn't want to be part of a situation that Eddie did this
crime and that he's responsible,'' she said. ``Then one morning I
got up and said, `It's right to feel that uncomfortable because I'm
playing the mother.' Use that discomfort - `Not my son!'''
   The movie also stars Taurean Blacque as the father, Jonah Perry
Sr., Curtis McClarin a Edmund Perry, Georg Stanford Brown as a
teacher, and Christopher Barnes as Edmund's friend. Kevin Hooks
directed on location in New York from a screenplay by Richard
Wesley, based on the book by Robert Sam Anson.
   ``When we filmed in Harlem, the boy's mother came down,'' Miss
Horsford said. ``We hadn't seen each other in a long time. We
talked about everything but the reason we were there. I met the
other two kids. We tried very hard to deal with the present. We
were shooting the movie, but we didn't talk about it.
   ``The only thing I didn't say that I wanted to say was how sorry
I was. But I was so happy that I was playing her rather than
someone who didn't know the nuances.''
   Miss Horsford was interviewed on the set of ``Amen,'' which has
returned after NBC took it off the air at the end of last season.
She was rehearsing a scene with Sherman Hemsley, who plays her
father, Deacon Ernest Frye.
   The show ended as Horsford's character, Thelma Frye, married the
Rev. Reuben Gregory, played by Clifton Davis.
   ``I went from being the vampy virgin to the oversexed
newlywed,'' she said, laughing.
   ``Thelma's the same, but she's happy. She's starting to find
little faults with her husband.''

<TEXT>
   It is a bittersweet season in America, a pause at the edge of
war. The nation has embraced hostages newly released, soldiers soon
to depart and memories of those already gone to the Persian Gulf.
   With some urgency, families have drawn especially close in the
knowledge that neither home for the holidays nor peace on earth can
be presumed.
   ``There's anxiety and loneliness,'' said Patricia Enninga, whose
son is in the Persian Gulf with the Army's 82nd Airborne Division.
``People are trying to grab onto whatever they can ... but
everything keeps changing.''
   Saddam Hussein says he won't let go of Kuwait. President Bush
stands firm behind his line in the sand. Between them lies Jan. 15,
the date after which the United Nations has approved the use of
force against Iraq.
   And in the balance are the families of 440,000 U.S. troops, some
of whom already are in Saudi Arabia.
   ``We're in a state of limbo,'' said Mrs. Enninga of Brooklyn
Center, Minn., who counsels families through Support Our Country's
Military. ``No one likes that feeling. No one likes not knowing.''
  A half-century ago, President Franklin Roosevelt tried to soothe
similarly anxious Americans as Adolf Hitler drew the nation into
World War II.
   ``Mankind is all one - and what happens in distant lands
tomorrow will leave its mark on the happiness of our Christmases to
come,'' Roosevelt said in an address on Christmas Eve 1940.
   ``But for most of us it can be a happy Christmas if by happiness
we mean that we have done with doubts, that we have set our hearts
against fear.''
   On the eve of 1991, however, ours is not a nation resolved.
   ``The question I hear being asked is: `Is the risk worth it?'
And I don't know what the answer is. I just know I keep hearing the
question being asked over and over again,'' said Bill Drengler, an
attorney with the National Guard in Wasau, Wis.
   Drengler, who opposed the Vietnam War, joined the Guard 18
months ago out of a sense of duty to his country. Now, he is
spending the holiday season helping members of mobilizing units put
their legal affairs in order.
   ``Most of the time that means helping people write their
wills,'' Drengler said. ``It's difficult in a fleeting moment to
wonder whether you're going to be sharing the holidays with your
family a year from now.''
   Operation Desert Shield has prompted countless newspaper columns
and letters to the editor. Cartoonist Garry Trudeau says his
readers apparently haven't minded his comic strip's Persian Gulf
focus, and radio talk-show hosts can't get their listeners off the
topic.
   Prayer vigils and other demonstrations for a peaceful end to the
conflict take place one day in Fort Wayne, Ind., another in
Lawrence, Kan., the next in Casper, Wyo.
   In just as many towns, merchants pack up morale boosters for
troops in Saudi Arabia: books, food of all kinds, designer
sunglasses, cologne, even a complete ballfield lighting system.
Families send tons of letters, videotaped messages, regulation
socks, photos, cookies, prayers.
   Already sobered by a deepening economic downturn, Americans are
reflecting on what a bloody war in a far-off desert could mean.
   ``It's an interesting moment for the country because it reflects
a kind of maturity,'' said Todd Gitlin, a sociologist at the
University of California at Berkeley. ``I certainly haven't
detected much gung-ho feeling on anyone's part. There is doubt
built in ... and that in many ways is healthy.''
   Recent polls have found Americans split on whether the United
States should take military action if Saddam doesn't withdraw from
Kuwait by Jan. 15. Bush's overall gulf policy has received mixed
reviews.
   ``In the beginning, my son and I both believed we were there for
a reason. Now it's getting foggy,'' said Elaine Smith of
Pittsburgh, mother of Marine Lance Cpl. Scott Schmeltz. ``I don't
want him there. I want him home with me.''
   Surrounded by five kids ages 7 to 14, Brenda Mabey is doing her
best to make their holiday cheerful. But she is without husband
Gary, who has been called to duty with the Wyoming Air National
Guard.
   Still Stateside, his phone calls have kept her going. But when
her husband has gone overseas, who will offer such reassurances?
   ``I spent all day ... decorating the house for Christmas and I
was blue. I was standing by the tree and Gary called,'' Mrs. Mabey
said. ``I lay on the couch and bawled for an hour on his shoulder.
He listened and said, `I know, sweetheart. You'll be all right.
Hang in there.' ''
   For the Coles, too, it is a poignant yuletide season. John Cole,
an oil worker, was among the ``human shields'' held 4{ months in
Iraq. Saddam's early December decision to release his foreign
hostages came as an unexpected gift.
   But the Coles haven't mounted a tree in their Odessa, Texas,
home. And there are no plans for a big holiday meal or caroling.
The family is not yet done dealing with the gulf crisis.
   ``Last year wasn't great because we had a son in Panama who was
shooting and being shot at come Christmastime. Now the same boy is
in Saudi Arabia, due to start shooting and be shot at,'' said Mrs.
Cole, whose son shipped out with the Army shortly after Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``It's a very unhappy adult world that we live in,'' she said.
   But perhaps most heart-breaking are the children who this year
have been touched by the swirling stuff of politics and world
events.
   ``It sometimes gets sad and lonely,'' said 9-year-old Ben
Munyon, who has been cared for by a baby sitter since his parents
were deployed to Saudi Arabia in August. ``I just write them. I get
my picture off the wall and hold it. Sometimes I fall asleep like
that.''
   ``Dear George Bush,'' wrote Jamille Byrd, a 7th-grader from
Killeen, Texas whose father is in Saudi Arabia, ``We need our
mothers, fathers and friends home for Christmas.''

   A slogan used by Quaker Oats Co. to advertise its
Gatorade sports drink infringes on a small company's trademark, a
federal judge has ruled.
   U.S. District Judge Prentice Marshall ordered Quaker to pay
$24.7 million in damages to Sands Taylor &amp; Woods of Norwich, Vt.
for using the phrase ``thirst aid'' in the slogan.
   Sands Taylor &amp; Woods operates a soft drink mix company and a
soda shop.
   Ron Bottrell, a spokesman for Quaker Oats, would not comment
immediately on the ruling.
   Quaker has used ``thirst aid'' on Gatorade bottles and in its
advertising jingles since 1984, Bottrell said.
   Gatorade has been on the market since 1967. Primarily used by
athletes or those performing strenuous exercise, it is designed to
replenish the fluids and electrolytes lost in high heat or through
exercise.

   The Norwegian government has authorized
development of the Embla oil and gas field by Belgian Petrofina and
the Norwegian unit of Phillips Petroleum Co., Petrofina said
Wednesday.
   Petrofina, which holds a 30 percent stake in Embla, said
production is expected to start during the fourth quarter of 1992
and is should reach around 50,000 barrels a day of oil and 85
million cubic feet of gas a day.
   The field operator is American Phillips, the Norwegian unit of
Phillips Petroleum, which is based in Bartlesville, Okla.
   A three-phase development is planned, beginning with drilling
eight production wells and installing an unmanned platform.
   The platform will be controlled from the Eldfisk oil field,
about three miles away.
   The second phase will include an evaluation of the southern part
of the Embla field. If the results are positive the field will be
developed during a third phase of operations.

<TEXT>
   William Gates, chief executive of Microsoft
Corp., is personally seeking to purchase the electronic-imaging
rights to thousands of well-known paitings and photographs, a
published report said today.
   The reported move by the 35-year-old trendsetter in the high
technology field would follow a recent flurry of acquisitions by
international conglomerates of the rights to movie and music
archives.
   The buyers feel those archives could provide royalties from
distribution as well as programming for hardware such as video and
compact disk players.
   The Wall Street Journal said Gates said he hasn't bought any
rights yet, but it quoted people negotiating with him as saying he
wants to lay the foundation for a library of electronic
still-images that could be licensed to future entertainment
systems.
   The story said Gates has quietly pursued the venture he is
calling Interactive Home Systems and declined to say how much he is
investing in it.
   He was quoted by the newspaper as saying his immediate goal is
to produce a pilot database of about 10,000 images before deciding
whether to compile a more extensive library of one million images.
   The story said those familiar with his plans say he is
considering using the images to support educational programs and
for use in entertainment packages to be displayed on big-screen TVs
in the home.
   Gates formed his venture more than a year ago to study the
commercial prospects of electronic images. The company has four
employees and is entirely funded by Gates.
   He was quoted by the Journal as saying the venture remains
speculative. ``We may do it; we may not do it.''

<HEAD>Economy Grew at 1.4 Percent Annual Rate from July Through
September</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS 2nd graf, The Commerce, to make first estimate 1.8
percent, sted 1.7 percent. Also moving on gheneral news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy was still growing at a weak
1.4 percent annual rate from July through September, the government
said today, but most economists believe it since has slipped into a
recession.
   The Commerce Department reported its final estimate of the
third-quarter gross national product was even slower than its
initial estimates. It first said in October that the GNP had inched
up 1.8 percent but revised that downward to 1.7 percent last month.
   In another report, the department said housing starts jumped 9.3
percent in November, their first increase in 10 months. But the
gain was due entirely to a rebound in multi-family starts as
single-family building fell to a level unmatched since the 1981-82
recession.
   The Federal Reserve Board noted the ``weakness in the economy''
Tuesday when it lowered the discount rate from 7 percent to 6.5
percent, effective today, to stimulate growth and ease the severity
of any contraction.
   But most economists say it will take months before the effects
of a lower rate work their way through the economy. The rate is the
interest the Fed charges on loans to banks and other financial
institutions.
   Even Bush administration officials, while avoiding the use of
the word ``recession,'' agree the economy is weakening. Earlier
this week, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady admitted it is
experiencing a ``significant slowdown'' that is likely to persist
through early 1991.
   Surveys of private economists and professional forecasters show
that most believe the economy actually is contracting and will
continue to deteriorate into next year.
   They contend the economy was stumbling along the rim of a
recession before the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and that the
subsequent oil-price shock shoved it over the edge.
   A recession generally is defined as two consecutive declines in
the GNP, the nation's total output of goods and services and its
broadest measure of economic health.
   It grew at an anemic 1.7 percent annual rate during the first
quarter, but slowed to an a barely perceptible 0.4 percent rate in
the second.
   The department also reported that a GNP measure of inflation
rose at an annual rate of 4.2 percent. It had been revised to 4.2
percent last month after the department initially said it had risen
4.1 percent.
   In its housing report, the department said starts of new homes
and apartments totaled a seasonally adjusted 1.13 million units
following a 6.6 percent drop in October. It was the first increase
since a 23.2 percent gain last January.
   Contributing most to the downward revision in the GNP was a
slower gain in consumer spending and a wider trade deficit than
first estimated.
   Consumer spending rose just 2.7 percent rather than the 3.2
percent reported last month. The trade deficit was $1.9 billion,
compared to a $500 million gap in last month's estimate.
   The largest upward revision was in government spending, up 1.2
percent rather than 0.6 percent as reported last month.
   Business investment advanced 8.9 percent while housing fell 19.8
percent during the quarter. Business inventories dropped $4.8
billion.
   The changes meant the total GNP was growing at an annual rate of
$4.17 trillion in the third quarter, when adjusted for inflation.
That was a gain of $15 billion over the second quarter.
   The GNP would need to increase 1.0 percent in the current
quarter to meet the administration's 0.7 percent growth estimate
for the year.
   Although most economist agree the economy has slipped into a
recession, they disagree over how negative economic growth will be
and how long the downturn will last. And most hedge their
predictions on the outcome of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Surveys indicate most economists believe the recession began in
the current quarter and will end by April.
   A December survey of 30 professional forecasters by the Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia shows a consensus of the participants
project the economy to decline at annual rates of about 1.3 percent
in the current quarter and 0.9 percent in the first quarter of 1991
before inching ahead again in the second.
   The consensus forecast of 52 prominent economists surveyed by
Blue Chip Economic Indicators this month finds an identical
projection.
   Nevertheless, individual forecasts vary widely with some
analysts saying the economy is in worse shape than the consensus
and others contending it is in better.
   Analysts at Mitsubishi Bank in New York, for instance, say
economic growth is dropping at a 2.5 percent rate. Economists at
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York say the GNP is declining
at a 3 percent rate this quarter. Fuji Securities in Chicago say
the economy will decline by 3.0 percent to 4.0 percent from October
through December.
   The surveys' consensus also shows the economy resuming growth in
the second quarter. But, again, this view is not unanimous.
   The Merrill Lynch economists, for instance, say they believe ``a
recovery can begin sometime in the second half of 1991.''
   Economists at Levy Economic Forecasts in Chappaqua, N.Y., also
forecast the recession itself will end in late 1991. But they
contend the recession marks the beginning of a ``contained
depression'' caused by overinvestment and that the resulting
overbuilding and excess capacity will take years to absorb.

   The stock market stalled in mixed trading today,
pausing after Tuesday's late rally sparked by the Federal Reserve's
surprise move to trim interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 2.23 points at
2,628.96 in the first hour and a half of trading.
   Advancers outnumbered decliners by about 7 to 5 in trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 764 up, 540 down and
527 unchanged.
   Trading was active. Volume on the Big Board came to 66.29
million shares as of 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Stocks turned sharply higher in the final hour of trading
Tuesday, spurred by the Fed's announcement that it would trim the
discount rate, the interest it charges member banks on loans, to
6.5 percent from 7 percent.
   Some market participants were anticipating follow-through buying
today, but concerns about the economy and the tensions in the
Middle East continued to nag the market.
   ``The market still has more things on its mind'' than interest
rates, said William Raftery, a vice president at Smith Barney,
Harris Upham &amp; Co. ``A lower discount rate is helpful, but it
doesn't get you off the sick bed right away.''
   Some investors were taking profits, while others ``were putting
money to work because of the promise of lower interest rates,'' one
trader said, accounting for the market's mixed tone.
   Among actively Big Board traded issues, Citicorp was down &rsqb; at

<HEAD>Judge Might Order Another Vote on Southland Reorganization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southland Corp.'s emergence from bankruptcy court
proceedings may be delayed by a second creditors' vote on a
prepackaged reorganization plan.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harold Abramson said Tuesday he may order
creditors to vote again on the plan the company filed in October
when it sought protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of
the federal bankruptcy laws.
   Southland, the Dallas-based owner of the 7-Eleven convenience
store chain, put the restructuring plan to a vote just before the
bankruptcy filing. Bondholders who oppose the package claim
Southland did not allow sufficient time for a fair vote. They also
claim some ballots were miscounted.
   ``I am prepared to hold that the vote doesn't comply with the
law,'' Abramson said during the second day of testimony.
   Southland, which had sales of almost $8 billion last year, said
it was overwhelmed by the debt left from its $4.9 billion leveraged
buyout in 1987.
   The company has been struggling under heavy interest payments
brought on by the buyout, which was announced before the Oct. 19,
1987 stock market crash, but financed after it.
   The bankruptcy filing listed $2.53 billion in assets and $3.38
billion in liabilities.
   Southland first proposed a restructuring last March, when it
announced the sale of most of the company to Ito-Yokado Co. Ltd.
and Seven-Eleven Japan Co. Ltd., its Japanese affiliates.
   The buyers would provide $430 million in cash for stock in the
reorganized company.
   That amounts to 70 percent of the reorganized Southland.
Creditors would get 25 percent and the company's founders, the
Thompson family of Dallas, would get 5 percent, under the
prepackaged plan.
   In a prepackaged filing, most creditors have approved a
reorganization plan before a company enters bankruptcy. If a judge
approves, the terms of the plan are then imposed on the dissenting
creditors. Proponents say the speedier process assures a fairer
deal for more creditors.
   Southland operates approximately 6,900 7-Eleven stores and other
convenience outlets in the United States and Canada, with another
6,000 stores in the United States and 21 other countries run by
licensees, of which Seven-Eleven Japan is the largest.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were lower in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The market opened lower on news that officials of the U.S.
Agriculture Department and the Soviet Union, meeting in London on
Tuesday, failed to agree on implementation of the export credit
program, said Victor Lespinasse, an analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. Among the issues in dispute is how grains
will be shipped to the Soviet Union.
   News that the Soviets bought 266,500 metric tons of corn is
expected to weigh on corn futures. Corn rallied earlier this week
on rumors of a sale of up to 600,000 metric tons.
   Sluggish export demand for wheat and soybeans is expected to
weigh on those futures.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent lower to } cent higher with
the contract for delivery in December at $2.51 a bushel; corn was }

   Livestock and pork futures were lower in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle futures were pressured by sluggish retail beef demand and
weakness in the cash markets.
   Pork futures fell due to lower cash hog prices and expectations
for steady to lower pork product prices.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .27 cent lower with December at
80.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .40 cent lower
with January at 88.82 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 cent lower

   A federal judge has confirmed
Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp.'s reorganization plan, ending five
years of litigation.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Warren Bentz on Tuesday signed the order
that will allow the company to stay in business.
Wheeling-Pittsburgh employs about 7,100 people at six major plants
in western Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia.
   Bentz said Dec. 8 he intended to approve the plan. He made the
announcement after two days of hearings into objections filed by
the Farmers Home Administration and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency.
   Under the reorganization plan, about $600 million in cash will
be distributed to creditors, company officials said. Plan
proponents say the reorganization is viable and will allow the
company to compete.
   The plan creates two corporations. One is Wheeling-Pittsburgh
Corp., a holding company led by New York investor Ronald LaBow, who
bought 86 percent of the company's secured debt. The other is
Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp., an operating subsidiary.
   Company officials have said the company plans a $454 million
capital improvement program over the next five years.

   A union representing Atlantic City casino
workers is controlled through mob killing, extortion, embezzlement
and bribery, the Justice Department said in court papers filed
today.
   In a suit filed in U.S. District Court, the Justice Department
is seeking to take control under civil racketeering statutes of the
22,000-member Local 54 of the Hotel Employees Restaurant Employees
International Union. The local represents hotel, bar and restaurant
workers in Atlantic City casinos and in other southern New Jersey
cities.
   The suit seeks court-ordered control of the local, the
restriction of the union's international president from the local's
affairs, the removal of the local's president and five other
officials, and the forfeiture of illegally obtained profits.
   Also named was Edward Hanley, president of the Washington,
D.C.-based international since 1973. The suit said he was an
associate of senior members of the Chicago-based organized-crime
family.
   Citing alleged dealings with organized crime figures in New
Jersey, New York and Las Vegas, prosecutors are seeking to bar
Hanley from further association with Local 54.
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said at a morning news
conference that the local has been controlled for 20 years by the
Bruno-Scarfo organized crime family, which controls Philadelphia
and southern New Jersey.
   ``Through their brutal and often deadly acts of violence and
intimidation, members of the Bruno-Scarfo families have destroyed
the integrity of the union and its leadership,'' Thornburgh said.
   Thornburgh said the organized crime families earned perhaps
hundreds of thousands of dollars through sweetheart contracts and
kickbacks.
   U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff said a key informant and witness
in the case would be Phil Leonetti, a mob informant expected to
testify against John Gotti, reputed boss of the Gambino crime
family in New York City.
   Two murders, an attempted murder and extortion are alleged in
the complaint served on defendants in several states, including
some held in federal prisons, Chertoff said.
   Nicodemo ``Little Nicky'' Scarfo has been controlling the local
from prison, where he is serving a life sentence for his 1988
conviction on Racketeer Influenced, Corrupt Organizations Act
charges, according to the complaint.
   Scarfo and eight other alleged crime family members also were
named in the suit.
   William Roy Silbert, who became Local 54 president in 1984, was
handpicked by Scarfo to take over for Francis Gerace, who was
forced to step down by the Casino Control Commission, according to
the suit.
   Gerace, who has remained with the union as a business agent, was
also named in the suit.

<NOTE>Eds: Adds details, background of strike. CORRECTS date of TV awards
ceremony.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of two troubled state-run television
channels resigned Wednesday. Journalists at one channel are on
strike, and popular programs on the other have been canceled for
financial reasons.
   Philippe Guilhaume, president of Antenne 2 and FR3, announced
his decision at a news conference while strikers jeered. He blamed
unspecified ``political powers'' for creating obstacles that made
his task impossible.
   The resignation coincided with separate crises at each of the
channels. which together employ more than 4,500 people.
   At FR3, which specializes in cultural programs and regional
news, most of its 600 journalists have been on strike since Nov. 28
seeking higher wages. About 100 of the strikers staged a protest at
luxury Plaza-Athenee hotel as Guilhaume arrived to hold his news
conference.
   At Antenne 2, which competes with the privately owned TF1 for
the largest share of French viewers, executives recently cancelled
or cut back a half-dozen popular programs for budgetary reasons.
The channel reportedly has amassed a deficit of more than 100
million dollars for 1990.
   Antenne 2's problems were thrust into the national spotlight on
Monday night, during the annual awards ceremony for the French
television industry.
   One of the winners was Frederic Mitterrand, who has been host or
producer of several Antenne 2 programs, including some that have
been affected by the cutbacks.
   Before a national TV audience, Mitterrand - a nephew of
President Francois Mitterrand - placed his trophy on the floor.
   ``That's where public television is - on the floor,'' he said,
noting that his protest was being broadcast by TF1, a former public
channel which was privatized in 1987.
   The Socialist government had made clear that it was not prepared
to defend Guilhaume.
   Prior to the resignation, Communications Minister Catherine
Tasca had questioned how Guilhaume could ``declare that all is
going well at a company in which the majority of employees say
there are problems.''
   Guilhaume, 48, was named head of the two channels in August 1989
by the government advisory board which oversees the television
industry.

   The stock market edged upward today, getting a
little more mileage out of Tuesday's late rally sparked by a cut in
the Federal Reserve's discount rate.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 33.41 points
Tuesday, rose 0.99 to 2,627.72 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 10 to 9 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 724 up, 652
down and 536 unchanged.
   Stocks turned sharply higher in the final hour of trading
Tuesday, spurred by the Fed's announcement that it would lower the
discount rate, the interest it charges member banks on loans, to
6.5 percent from 7 percent.
   Some market participants were anticipating follow-through buying
today, but concerns about the economy and the tensions in the
Middle East continued to nag the market.
   ``The market still has more things on its mind'' than interest
rates, said William Raftery, a vice president at Smith Barney,
Harris Upham &amp; Co. ``A lower discount rate is helpful, but it
doesn't get you off the sick bed right away.''
   Some investors were taking profits, while others ``were putting
money to work because of the promise of lower interest rates,'' one
trader said, accounting for the market's mixed tone.
   Among the volume leaders, Citicorp fell { to 13|. On Tuesday the
company estimated a fourth-quarter loss of $300 million to $400
million, and proposed to cut its dividend.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .11 to 180.30. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .72 at 305.75.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 92.27 million shares at

<TEXT>
   Britain's economy shrank 1.2 percent in the third
quarter, the biggest contraction in 10 years, the government said
Wednesday.
   The Central Statistical Office said a cut in oil production was
to blame for the drop in its average estimate of gross domestic
product.
   The Treasury's top official, meanwhile, said the outlook was for
a weak performance in the fourth quarter of 1990 and early 1991.
   But Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont told a year-end
briefing of foreign journalists that the current slowdown is a
desirable by-product of years of rapid expansion.
   Although companies and industries undoubtedly will suffer from a
slowdown, ``this is the price you pay to get inflation down,'' he
said.
   Lamont predicted the downturn would not last as long as
Britain's 1980-81 recession.

   The Federal Reserve's dramatic decision to cut
a key interest rate effective today will reduce Americans'
borrowing costs, but won't avert a recession, economists say.
   The first drop in the Fed's discount rate in four years, from 7
percent to 6.5 percent, will almost certainly prompt banks to
reduce their lending rates, analysts said. The discount rate is the
interest the Fed charges member banks for loans.
   Despite a series of modest credit-loosening steps by the Fed
starting in late October, major banks - under pressure to shore up
their dwindling profits - have steadfastly resisted passing on
lower rates to borrowers.
   The prime rate - the interest that banks charge their best
business customers - has been stuck at 10 percent at all but a
handful of smaller institutions. A wide variety of other business
and consumer loans are tied to it.
   Norwest Bank of Minneapolis was the first to respond to the
Fed's action. Late Tuesday, it announced a cut in its prime rate to
9.75 percent.
   A drop in the discount rate is the most visible way the central
bank can signal its determination to rescue the economy from a
slump. For months, the Bush administration had been pressuring the
independent agency to do more to stave off recession.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater had applauded the Fed's
latest move, saying ``it should be helpful in promoting growth in
the economy in the months ahead.''
   But today, he sidestepped a question on whether banks should
lower their prime lending rates in response to the Fed action,
saying that was a market decision.
   ``Normally a discount-rate cut reverberates throughout the
system,'' Fitzwater said.
   Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher called it ``a very
positive step'' that would set the base for economic recovery.
   Economists agreed, but they added that looser credit is coming
too late to avert a recession, loosely defined as a contraction of
the economy lasting at least six months. They said recovery will
not come until late next year, at the earliest, even if the Fed
cuts rates further, as expected.
   ``It will really almost be summertime before we feel the full
impact of the changes,'' said economist Paul Getman of Regional
Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. ``Unfortunately ... poor
growth over the next six months is preordained.''
   Many economists had not expected a decline in the discount rate
until next month at the earliest. They assumed the Fed would wait
to see whether a shooting war broke out in the Persian Gulf after
the Jan. 15 United Nations deadline for Iraq to withdraw from
Kuwait.
   Analysts said three factors prompted the central bank to move
sooner: concern that the economic downturn is accelerating, worry
about the weakness of the banking system and the opportunity to
move on a day when the bond market was rallying on good inflation
news.
   ``The Fed obviously is now seeing an economy that is spiraling
downward,'' said economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co.
in New York. ``Virtually all of the numbers they've been looking at
have been extremely negative.''
   Unemployment in November jumped to a three-year high of 5.9
percent. One of the few bright spots in the economy has been trade,
but the Commerce Department reported Tuesday that the deficit took
an unexpected leap to $11.6 billion in October, the worst monthly
trade gap in 2{ years.
   Until now, aggressive easing by the Fed had been prevented by a
substantial minority of policymakers who feared that inflation -
already aggravated by skyrocketing oil prices caused by the Persian
Gulf crisis - would resurge.
   However, the Labor Department reported Tuesday that consumer
prices in November rose at a moderate 3.7 percent annual rate, down
from an 8.9 percent rate over the previous three months.
   Also, analysts said the increasing fragility of the nation's
largest banks added to the concern of the Federal Reserve, which
was created in 1913 to protect the nation's financial system.
   On Tuesday, the largest U.S. bank, Citicorp, said it would lay
off 8,000 employees, slash its dividend to shareholders and set
aside $350 million to cover bad loans.

<TEXT>
   All Nippon Airways, Japan's second-biggest airline,
said Wednesday it would order 15 of Boeing's new 777 airplanes and
take options on 10 others in a deal potentially worth several
billion dollars if all options are filled.
   All Nippon also said it would order five A-340s from European
rival Airbus Industrie and take options on five others.
   An All Nippon official said both types of planes will cost about
$150 million each, and replacement engines and other related
equipment could bring the value of the total package to $5.6
billion.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
contracts will be signed early next year with Boeing Co. for the 15
firm orders and 10 options for delivery between 1995 and 2000.
   He said the planes, with 411 seats, will be used on domestic
routes.
   Boeing would receive $2.25 billion for the 15 firm orders.
   The announcement boosts Boeing's 777 order book to 49 firm
orders. United Airlines of Chicago ordered 34 of the new widebody
twinjets in October to launch the new plane. United also took
options on 34 more 777s that are to go into service in mid-1995.
   Boeing had hoped to launch the plane with 100 orders, but went
ahead with the lower number.
   The All Nippon official said the airline would sign contracts
early next year with Airbus for five firm orders and five options
for delivery between 1996 and 2000. The A-340 planes, with 236
seats, will be used on international routes, he said.
   All Nippon now has a fleet of 105 aircraft.

<TEXT>
   The European Community on Wednesday
fined three chemical concerns a total $66.2 million for running a
cartel in the Western European market for soda ash.
   The action includes the largest EC anti-trust fine ever imposed
- $41.4 million against Solvay, Belgium's largest chemical company.
Solvay called the fine ``utterly unreasonable'' and said it would
appeal.
   The EC Commission also fined Britain's Imperial Chemical
Industries PLC $23.5 million and Chemische Fabrik Kalk GmbH, a unit
of BASF AG of Germany, $1.38 million.
   The commission said the companies had an agreement by which ICI
would not sell soda ash on the continent if Solvay and Chemische
Fabrik Kalk stayed out of Britain.
   The commission said Solvay and ICI had fixed the market so that
companies looking for secondary sources of soda ash ended up buying
from the cartel anyway.
   Soda ash is used in the chemical industry as a neutralizing
agent. It also accounts for up to 60 percent of the raw material
costs of glass making.
   It is so widely used the commission said the cartel's effect
``is ultimately felt by millions of consumers.''
   The fine is the second blow to Solvay in the three months. In
October, the EC withdrew all anti-dumping duties on soda ash
imports from the American Natural Soda Ash Corp.
   Analysts say the end of the duties may hit Solvay's earnings
severely. Soda ash and its derivatives represent 10 percent of
Solvay's total sales.

   Mannesmann AG said Wednesday it is
forming a joint venture with Digital Equipment Corp. that will give
Digital effective control over the German company's computer
operations.
   The transaction ends Mannesmann's lengthy search for a partner
for its computer units, which have seen their profits slide. At the
same time, it provides Digital with a greater presence in Europe,
especially in the field of industrial computer applications.
   Under the terms of the agreement, Mannesmann will spin off the
computer operations of its Mannesmann Kienzle GmbH division into a
jointly owned company, Digital-Kienzle Computersysteme.
   Digital will pay about $230 million for a 65 percent stake in
that company, which would be Digital's biggest external investment
ever, the announcement said.
   Mannesmann's computer units have annual sales of about $540
million. Their profit dropped sharply last year to about $2.4
million from $15.4 million the year before.
   The German subsidiary of Digital had revenue of $835 million in
its fiscal 1990, which ended June 30.
   Digital Equipment, based in Maynard, Mass., had worldwide
revenue of $12.9 billion in its fiscal 1990.

   Credit Boeing for the soft landing.
   Recessions usually hit this area harder than elsewhere. But this
time, economists say, the good fortune of The Boeing Co. should
cushion Seattle and much of Washington state from the economic
downturn of the rest of the country.
   In a state where a superheated economy produced an average
annual job growth of 5 percent since 1985, economists are
forecasting that things might return to normal.
   Economically, the late 1980s were kind to Seattle. Real estate
values soared in a city considered by many to be among the most
livable. Jobs were so plentiful that fast-food joints offered $7.25
an hour for flipping burgers. Developers rebuilt the city's skyline
with more than a dozen major buildings.
   Much of that prosperity can be attributed to Boeing, which has
104,700 workers in Washington and accounts for one out of every six
jobs, directly or indirectly, in the state.
   By late December Boeing had received $46.6 billion in new
commercial jet business for 1990, approaching a sixth record year
of orders. Planes ordered three or four years ago are rolling off
assembly lines at a rate of better than one a day.
   In November, however, state officials acknowledged that the
recession gripping much of the country had spread mildly to
Washington. State economist Chang Mook Sohn forecasts a net loss of
10,000 non-farm jobs statewide in the first half of 1991, about .5
percent of the 2.1 million member workforce.
   In Seattle, a real estate market that had seen home prices climb
60 percent to 70 percent from 1987 to 1989 returned to normal, as
too many homes were put up for sale for prices too few buyers could
afford.
   Construction also declined, with some commercial developers
delaying projects and complaining about an overbuilt downtown. Weak
manufacturing and construction in turn have hurt services, the
retail-wholesale trade and finance sectors, Sohn said.
   What happened? Again, Sohn and other economists look to Boeing.
   From 1983 to 1989, Boeing's employment in this area exploded
from 58,000 to 106,000 - 37 percent of all jobs created in
Washington during that period were with the planemaker.
   ``It was the main force behind the rapid immigration to the
state and the main force behind the housing boom that resulted,''
said Douglas Pedersen, vice president and chief economist for
Security Pacific Bank of Washington.
   Boeing's employment peaked in 1989 as commercial production
became more efficient and defense cuts threatened government
projects. While the growth in aerospace jobs appears over for now,
Sohn says Boeing's employment isn't likely to fall much further.
   One of the big differences between the current downturn and
previous recessions, Sohn said, is the role of the aerospace
industry. In the past, a slowdown in planemaking was an advance
symptom of a recession and tended to pull down Washington's
economy.
   ``Aerospace works this time is a buffer rather than a
destabilizing force,'' he said.
   The recession of the early '80s was magnified here by Boeing
laying off 22,000 employees as orders and deliveries of aircraft
fell.
   In 1982, 106 aircraft were ordered and 176 were delivered. As
1990 drew to a close, Boeing's orders already had reached 517
airplanes, and it had delivered at least 364.
   It has a firm backlog of at least 1,850 planes and hundreds more
options for purchases, and is booking delivery dates past the turn
of the century.
   The region isn't without its worries, though. The timber
industry, for example, is hurting from a slump in homebuilding and
higher log prices.
   The home construction slowdown also has hit here, but again, not
as hard as elsewhere.
   Statewide housing starts for 1990 total 43,600, about 3.8
percent fewer than 1989, Pedersen says. Commercial construction
also is lagging.
   ``There's very little new building under way and little
likelihood of more building in the next few years,'' said Jon
Runstad, president and chief executive officer of Wright Runstad, a
major Seattle developer.

<HEAD>Lagging Exports Push Grains, Soybeans Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as export trade continued
to lag behind expectations.
   Helping to push prices lower was news that U.S. and Soviet
officials Tuesday failed to agree on terms of the $500 million to
$1 billion export credit offer made by the United States. The
Soviet Union wants the credit offer to include the cost of shipping
farm products to the USSR, a condition the United States is
relunctant to agree to.
   Analysts said if the cost of shipping is included, it would
leave the Soviets with less money to purchase grain.
   Soybean futures were heavily pressured by word of a major
purchase of South American soybean meal by the Soviet Union.
   ``So much attention is being paid the lack of business from the
Soviet Union that people are ignoring the fact sales to our
traditional customers - Taiwan, South Korean and Japan - are
down,'' said analyst Joel Karlin of Research Department Inc in
Chicago, adding that those countries are buying from China, which
had a record crop.
   ``They don't feel the pressure to buy U.S. grains as they have
(felt) in the past,'' Karlin said.
   At the close, wheat was { cent to 4 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $2.47} a bushel; corn was 1
cent to 3{ cents lower with December at $2.24 a bushel; oats were 1

   A 150-year-old former woolen mill in this
sleepy Massachusetts town seems an unlikely home for the world's
second-largest computer company.
   But then, Digital Equipment Corp. is not your typical
$13-billion-a-year corporation.
   Unlike many major companies, Digital has never felt the need for
a flashy headquarters. It also has never laid off an employee, even
at the depths of a computer industry slump in the early 1980s.
   Now, that corporate benevolence is being tested as Digital girds
itself for the double whammy of a computer industry downturn and a
recession.
   The hard times already have hit home at the ``mill,'' as
employees call the red-brick complex 30 miles west of Boston that
once turned out Army blankets.
   Earlier this year, Digital reported its first-ever loss, a $256
million deficit for the quarter ended June 30. For the fiscal year
ended that day, Digital's profit dropped to $74.4 million from
$1.07 billion a year earlier. To blame was a $550 million charge
against earnings Digital took to pay for a plan that is aimed at
reducing staff through voluntary severance offers.
   Digital's stock price also has suffered, falling from an
all-time high of $199.50 in 1987 to the range of $57 a share.
   The company announced several waves of cutbacks, including plant
closings and the elimination of 9,000 employees through the end of
next June by voluntary means.
   Some industry analysts predict even more staff cuts - including
layoffs. John Logan of the Boston high-tech research firm Aberdeen
Group believes Digital will fire at least 10,000 of its 123,000
employees in early 1991. Other analysts peg the number at 20,000.
   Analysts blame Digital's problems chiefly on a bloated payroll.
Logan said workers at a Phoenix assembly plant were put to work
painting the walls after demand for the products they made dried
up. Digital recently said it would close the plant.
   ``They can lay off 15 percent of their organization and still
not cut into the meat,'' Logan said.
   He said Digital has the lowest revenue per employee of any
computer maker - about $104,000 during last fiscal year, compared
with $164,000 at International Business Machines Corp. in 1989.
   But layoffs would not come without a price, particularly to
Kenneth Olsen, Digital's 64-year-old co-founder and president.
   ``It's a personal tragedy of Ken Olsen to have layoffs,'' Logan
said. He added that worker morale has been hurt as employees wait
for the expected pink slips.
   Not that Digital's predicament is unique. Many other computer
companies have been eliminating workers as demand slowed. Troubled
Unisys Corp. has endured several rounds of layoffs, and industry
leader IBM has been scaling back through voluntary means.
   Like other computer makers along Massachusetts' Route 128
technology belt, Digital has been hurt by the slowdown in sales of
minicomputers, machines designed for more than one user that are
smaller than closet-size mainframes but larger than desktop models.
   As personal computers and the slightly larger models called
workstations have grown more powerful, they have chipped away the
market for minicomputers - Digital's traditional strength.
   But Olsen blames his company's problems on the economy, not a
minicomputer slump.
   ``For the last few years people have not, in this country, been
investing in the future,'' he said recently in his modest office,
where vacuum tubes and computer parts line the exposed brick walls.
   Digital was geared up for a certain level of sales, he said.
When these revenues failed to materialize, profits sagged as excess
overhead took its toll.
   ``We have a religious belief that as we make more computation
available for less money, the demand will grow even faster. So in
the last few years - more than ever in the past - we have been
increasing the (computing) capacity we offer and at lower price.''
   The formula failed as the economy slowed. ``But we believe it's
a short-term thing,'' he said.
   Digital also was hurt as customers waited for promised new
models before placing orders. Among the newer machines are
Digital's first mainframe computers, which the company announced in
October 1989 in a bid to compete more directly with IBM.
   However, shipment of these VAX 9000 models was delayed several
times. In the most recent acknowledgement of problems, Digital said
last week it would swap some of the circuits in the 100 or so
mainframes it has delivered to prevent a problem that caused some
of the machines to crash.
   Digital's cutbacks, profit declines and problems with the
mainframes don't take away from the fact that the company has been
a singular American success story, industry watchers say.
   Analyst Peter Schay of the research firm Gartner Group Inc. in
Stamford, Conn., calls Digital ``arguably the most successful
startup of the post-war period in any industry.''
   Olsen was a young Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate
when he co-founded the company in 1957, with the help of venture
capital.
   Digital's first breakthrough product was the PDP-1, which in
effect was the first personal computer. Introduced in 1960, the
PDP-1 used a video screen and a keyboard to enter information
directly into the computer - a major advance in an era when
programs were entered using punch cards, and users sometimes had to
wait hours or days until a program was processed.
   Digital continually upgraded the PDP line. But its next
breakthrough was the VAX line, introduced in 1977. All VAX models
can be hooked together easily and use the same software - in
contrast to IBM's computer lines.
   In a long-running ad campaign, Digital has pounded home the
message that ``Digital has it now'' - playing off IBM's unfulfilled
promise of being able to link all its machines seamlessly in a
network.
   The VAX line has been enormously popular, helping Digital's
profit grow nearly fourfold from 1984 to 1988, while revenues
doubled.
   The company's good fortune began to wane after the October 1987
stock market crash, as the slowing economy hit all computer makers.
About the same time, the minicomputer slump set in, some customers
began to perceive Digital's product line as tired, and competitors
introduced machines that provided stronger competition, analysts
say.
   Also, Digital was hurt by the growing interest among customers
for ``open'' computer systems - in which machines from any maker
can be connected and use the same software, analysts say.
   In 1988, Digital announced products that provide these features
by masking the differences between computer brands. It since has
become a leader in computer ``integration,'' or making different
brands work together.
   Digital announced in October it plans to make its VAX line
compatible with software written for the Unix operating system,
which is becoming an industry standard. An operating system is the
base layer of software that controls a computer's internal
functions.
   In the past two years, Digital has taken other steps to address
the open-systems movement. It introduced a workstation line that
uses the Unix operating system rather than the VAX one. It also
began offering IBM-compatible personal computers made for it by
Tandy Corp., addressing its lack of home-grown personal computers.
   And in October, Digital announced new small computers that also
use Intel Corp. microprocessors, which are the ``brains'' of IBM
and IBM-compatible personal computers. These machines, which
Digital makes itself, are aimed at small- and medium-sized
businesses.
   ``DEC today is a very different company than it was 2{ years ago
from a product point of view,'' Schay said.
   He also said Digital's profit slump shouldn't overshadow the
fact that the company is financially strong, with low debt and a
large cash reserve.
   Olsen emphasized the same point.
   ``Our profit is down but we're not troubled in the traditional
sense,'' he said.
   ``We've gone through many recessions,'' he added. ``We'll do
better when our customers are successful.''

   Like Henry Ford at Ford Motor Co. and
Thomas Watson at IBM, Ken Olsen is the guiding light at Digital
Equipment Corp.
   That raises the question of how the computer giant will fare
once the 64-year-old co-founder and president moves on.
   Though Olsen says he has no plans to retire anytime soon, and
the company has no mandatory retirement age, Digital eventually
will have to deal with life without the man who has run it for 33
years.
   But Digital-watchers don't appear too concerned.
   ``I really don't believe it's a one-man company,'' said Wes
Melling, an analyst at the high-tech research firm Gartner Group
Inc. who once worked for Digital.
   ``There's no question he is a very strong personality and that
the culture he has built into the company strongly reflects his
values and management style. But I think it is the kind of culture
that can exist independent of the man,'' Messing said.
   ``Digital is kind of a Japanese company in the sense that many
of the key decisions are made as consensus decisions,'' he added.
``He picks things he thinks are critical for the company and he
really focuses on those things. That also says that there are 200
other projects out there that the managers get to manage.''
   Industry analysts take Olsen at his word that he has no plans to
retire soon. That appears to ease concern about the lack of a
designated heir-apparent.
   ``He is a founder. He has said many times he wants to continue
in an active role. So I'm not going to forecast what might
happen,'' said Jay Stevens, who follows Digital for Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   John Logan, an analyst at the computer research firm Aberdeen
Group, said Digital has a group of vice presidents in their 40s
that Olsen ``has been grooming for 20 years'' as possible
successors.
   Olsen has been giving more day-to-day responsibility for running
Digital to John Smith, the senior vice president for operations.
But Olsen denies that has any bearing on a decision to retire.
   ``I always say I'll leave graciously, but maybe they'll have to
kick me out. But it won't be for a while,'' he said in a recent
interview.

<HEAD>USX, Union to Resume Labor Contract Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE DRESSLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp. and the United Steelworkers union
said Wednesday they will resume talks Jan. 7 on a new labor
contract for 18,000 workers.
   ``If we're going to keep making steel, we have to make a deal,''
said chief union negotiator Andrew ``Lefty'' Palm.
   The current four-year contract expires Feb. 1. Talks aimed at an
early agreement were recessed Nov. 10 after the sides failed to
reach a contract by that date.
   ``We've kept the door open for the resumption of the process,
and the groundwork has been laid for us to negotiate an agreement
that meets the needs of our members,'' Palm said.
   USX, the nation's largest steel maker, said it was optimistic an
agreement will be reached by Jan. 31. Palm said ``it's hard to
say'' whether negotiators will meet the deadline.
   ``USX plays everything right to the end,'' he said.
   The union wants USX to fall in line with other steel makers who
restored pay cuts that workers absorbed during the industry's
decline in the early 1980s.
   Palm said the company's last proposal would have restored wages
to the 1982 level but not provided increases beyond that. The union
is seeking an additional $1.50 an hour, he said.
   Companies that have agreed to reinstate pay concessions include
Bethlehem Steel Corp., National Steel Corp., Armco Inc. and
financially ailing Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. and LTV Steel
Co.
   USX Chairman Charles A. Corry has said the company will ignore
the agreements with other steel makers.
   The union has also said the company's proposal failed to address
cost-of-living increases and the possibility of a corporate
restructuring. USX plans to make its steel division a wholly owned
subsidiary.
   The current contract was reached after a six-month work stoppage
in 1986.
   USX makes steel in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana and Alabama.
It also mines iron ore and operates several joint ventures,
including a partnership with Japan's Kobe Steel in Lorain, Ohio.

<HEAD>NBC International in Distribution, Production Pact in Japan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The international arm of the National
Broadcasting Co. said Wednesday it has formed a joint venture with
two Japanese companies that will distribute NBC programs in the Far
East and produce shows in Japan.
   NBC said the deal will improve its ability to distribute
NBC-produced programs in Asia and to explore potential media
investments in Japan.
   But even in announcing the venture, NBC executives said the new
company was being unfairly constrained by federal regulations that
limit what the three major U.S. television networks can do in
program production and distribution.
   NBC and the companies that own the other two networks, CBS Inc.
and Capital Cities-ABC Inc., have asked the Federal Communications
Commission to lift or modify the financial interest and syndication
rules.
   The Hollywood studios generally oppose modification of the
rules, saying the networks are gatekeepers of the broadcast
airwaves and would have too much power over what is shown on
television without them.
   NBC International said its partners in the new venture called
NNBC are Mitsui &amp; Co. Ltd., a Japanese trading company, and TV
Tokyo Channel 12, a Japanese TV network.
   Terms of the venture agreement, including how much each partner
was investing and what their relative equity stake in the new
company is, were not disclosed.
   The new company will distribute NBC-produced entertainment and
sports programming in Japan and other countries in the Far East,
according to J.B. Holston III, senior vice president and general
manager of NBC International.
   This could include shows such as the dramatic series ``Shannon's
Deal'' or the miniseries ``Lucky-Chances.''
   Richard Cotton, general counsel at NBC, said NBC would like to
be able to distribute programs other than those it produces itself,
but cannot do so because of the federal regulations.
   The new venture would also produce a variety of programs in
Japan that could then be sold to TV networks or stations abroad,
Holston said.
   Cotton said federal regulations would prohibit NBC from
importing any of these co-produced programs for use on its U.S.
television network, however.
   ``Today's agreement represents a significant international
business opportunity for NBCI, and we look forward to the day when
we can increase our international activities,'' Holston said.
   NBC International has a number of similar distribution
agreements in other countries, Cotton said. NBC spokesman Richard
Cutting said the only similar co-production agreement involving NBC
is Tango Productions in Great Britain, where its partner is the
independent television company Yorkshire TV.
   Earlier this week, NBC News said it had entered into a joint
newsgathering venture with Nippon Television Network of Japan,
another Japanese broadcast network. That deal is separate from the
NNBC joint venture.

<HEAD>Indicates Company Could Be `Split Up' If Plan Fails</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philips President Jan D. Timmer
suggested Wednesday that the Dutch electronics giant might be
broken up and sold in pieces if his drastic reorganization plan
fails.
   ``Splitting the company up is the very last resort, a step that
neither I nor Philips are ready to take,'' Timmer said in an
interview published in a company news journal distributed to the
staff.
   Timmer did not elaborate on what he meant, but the remarks
appeared timed to clear the air of rampant speculation that the
285,000-employee Philips empire was in danger of crumbing.
   This past summer Timmer decreed an extraordinary cost-cutting
drive at Philips aimed at trimming fat from the company and making
it more competitive with aggressive Japanese rivals.
   Part of the cutback involves eliminating 55,000 jobs among
Philips' worldwide operations, which manufacture consumer
electronic items ranging from light bulbs to televisions.
   ``I do not deny that the restructuring operation will involve
the ending and divestment of activities, but it is certainly not
the intention to let the company fall apart,'' Timmer said.
   ``Our first responsibility is to restore Philips to full
health,'' Timmer said. ``We are assuming that if everyone does
their bit, improvements can be made throughout Philips that will
allow us to maintain the company in its present form.''
   Timmer said ``we are already seeing the first signs of
improvement'' for Philips, which is expecting a $2.4 billion loss
this year.
   ``Without these measures the company would have got into
tremendous difficulties,'' Timmer said. ``If you accept the
presidency, then you cannot evade the responsibility to take a
hard, uncompromising line in turning the company around if that is
what is needed.''
   Tom Gietman, an Amsterdam-based analyst with the Van Meer-James
Capel brokerage firm, speculated that the statements were aimed
partly at Philips' Dutch labor unions, which are negotiating to
minimize the impact of the job losses.
   ``It is just a warning to the negotiators to take a better
position,'' Gietman said.
   Fokko Tuin, head of research at Kempen and Co., said that Timmer
``is indicating ... that as long as possible everything will be
kept together as it is. But in the end, a break-up remains a
possibility.''

<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board on
Wednesday urged the auto industry to redesign seat belts so they
can easily be used by children, short adults and the elderly.
   In a letter to 33 American and foreign auto companies, the board
said the change would increase seat-belt use and promote safety. It
hopes to persuade automakers to install an adjustable upper anchor
for the shoulder strap portion of the seat belt in all new cars.
   European automakers generally offer adjustable upper anchors,
but the system isn't generally available in the United States, the
board said. Earlier this year, the boardincluded the proposed
change on a ``most wanted'' list of safety recommendations.
   The board said in its letter that serious accident injuries may
result from improper seat-belt use because of an inability to
adjust them to the size of the occupant.
   ``Improper use can degrade the belt's ability to prevent serious
injury and, given certain accident circumstances, may introduce the
possibility of serious belt-induced injuries,'' the letter said.
   Thomas Carr, director of safety for the Motor Vehicle
Manufacturer's Association in Detroit, said the group and its
member auto companies would ``discuss and consider'' the
recommendation.
   Carr agreed that if seat belts are more comfortable there are
less objections to using them.
   ``The only issue is to what extent people might misadjust belts,
not putting them in the best position because it's a lot more
comfortable,'' he said, contending that seat belts now are
positioned ``to the advantage of the vast majority of the
population.''
   A 1988 NTSB report noted that the most common mistake in
seat-belt use, especially in seating children, was to place the
shoulder portion of the belt behind a child's back. Parents
commonly do that because they can't adjust that part of the belt
and don't want it to come in contact with a child's face or neck.
   ``Short adults also share the fear of neck injury from an
ill-fitting shoulder harness and also may be tempted to misroute
the belt,'' the board said. ``Another form of misuse noted was the
placing of the shoulder portion of the belt under the arm, a
routing that can have fatal consequences.''
   The board said that while the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration declined to require a redesign to make shoulder
harnesses adjustable, it encourages manufacturers to do so
voluntarily.
   Ford, the board said, plans to introduce the device in some
four-door models next spring and will phase it in forher car, light
truck and van models over the next two to three years.
   General Motors provides the adjustable anchor only on the
four-door Oldsmobile 98 and the four-door Buick Park Avenue, it
said.
   The board said that because of mandatory seat-belt laws in 36
states, seat-belt use increased from 14 percent in 1984 to 50
percent this year.
   In a 1988 study of serious accidents, 80 percent of 214
front-seat occupants wearing properly adjusted seat belts sustained
only minor or moderate injuries or no injuries at all, the board
said.

<HEAD>Times Discloses Some Terms of Bass Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After settling a shareholder suit
with Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass and others, the Times
Publishing Co. has emerged with $8.1 million cash and a healthy
balance sheet, newly disclosed documents show.
   The settlement reached last August specified that neither side
would reveal any details, but Times Publishing released some
information Tuesday to satisfy requests from the state of Florida.
   The disclosure gave several details about the privately held
company that publishes the St. Petersburg Times. But the amount the
company paid Bass to drop his suit was not reported.
   Under the terms of the settlement, Times Publishing agreed to
buy back a 40 percent stake owned by the Bass group. The group had
purchased the stake in August 1988 for about $28 million and had
offered to buy the rest of the company for $270 million earlier
this year.
   The documents released Tuesday show total bank debt for the
newspaper company as of Nov. 30 was $9 million.
   ``The company is strong and vital and we can go on to other
things,'' chief executive and editor Andrew Barnes said.
   According to company treasurer Catherine Heron, the company's
cash position ``would cover the majority of existing bank debt.''
   The $9 million debt will be paid off by 1995, she said.
   The documents were released to the Florida Attorney General Bob
Butterworth's office, which was concerned that the shareholder
settlement could adversely affect the Poynter Institute for Media
Studies in St. Petersburg.
   The institute is the chief shareholder of Times publishing.
After acquiring its stake, the Bass partnership had sued Times
Publishing over dividend payments, the bulk of which support the
institute's educational programs.
   Under the settlement, Times Publishing agreed to buy back the
Bass stake and redeem an issue of non-voting stock, which paid
healthy dividends to the institute.
   At the time of the settlement, the company claimed the agreement
would not hurt the institute. It said the preferred shares held by
the institute would be replaced by debt, which would pay more in
annual interest than the preferred stock once paid in dividends.
The company said the institute also could expect to receive
dividends from the common stock it holds.
   The latest disclosures show the institute eventually will own
all of the Times Publishing common stock.
   Robert Lanzillotti, dean emeritus of the University of Florida's
graduate business school, was hired by the institute to
independently review the Bass settlement.
   He said it ``will make possible substantially greater financial
support for the institute's operations and growth over the long
run.''
   In addition to the St. Petersburg newspaper, one of the largest
and most prominent in the South, Times Publishing runs
Congressional Quarterly, Florida Trend and Georgia Trend magazines.

<HEAD>Shanghai Securities Market Opens, But Few Stocks Offered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's first computerized stock market opened
Wednesday in Shanghai with almost no stocks for sale.
   Instead, government bonds are the main offering and even their
sale will be tightly restricted.
   The new Shanghai Securities Exchange, which opened with great
fanfare, falls far short of what economic reformers envisioned
several years ago when they proposed setting up a nationwide tock
market.
   The exchange listed only seven stocks on opening day, reflecting
the government's fear of allowing financial speculation.
Authorities also are unenthusiastic about stocks because they
transfer ownership of companies from state hands to the private
sector.
   The market concluded 93 transactions involving a total of 10.29
million yuan, worth about $1.98 million on its first day, the
official news agency Xinhua said.
   It said more than 500 people attended an opening ceremony
presided over by Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji, widely regarded as an
economic reformer.
   Chinese with cash to invest have demonstrated a keen interest in
buying securities, especially stocks, but the government has not
made it easy for them.
   Until Shanghai's market opened, they had to keep track of
differing prices at unlinked trading counters at various Shanghai
banks. Most counters were open only a few days a week.
   There was a burst of excitement Monday night after the
Shanghai-based Shenghua Electronics Corp. announced plans to sell
120,000 shares of stock. Thousands of people lined up overnight at
the scattered trading counters to get application forms to buy.
   ``If you want to be a stockholder, you must suffer through the
cold,'' one man told the Shanghai Evening News newspaper.
   With the opening of the unified market, investors will have
one-stop shopping. But they will be able to buy and sell only
through the exchange's 22 member brokerages.
   Gong Haocheng, governor of the Shanghai branch of China's
central bank, said buyers are limited to 10 shares apiece of each
stock issue in order to control speculation. Bonds are traded only
for the years 1986-89.
   Gong said authorities have not decided whether to let
foreign-funded enterprises sell shares.
   The Shanghai Securities Exchange originally was planned as a
nationwide market and has established ties with more that 60
security trading counters around the country.
   However, it will be competing with the computerized Securities
Automated Quotations System that opened in Beijing two weeks ago
and also will trade securities on a national basis. The two systems
were to have worked closely but apparently are now under the
guidance of rival government authorities.
   In addition, the southeastern special economic zone of Shenzhen
already has a primitive stock market with six listed companies.
Shenzhen and nearby the Zhuhai special zone both plan to develop
computerized markets next year.
   The government allowed the first stock issue under Communist
rule in 1985. Thousands of companies have issued stocks, but
generally only to employees. Few are actively traded.

<HEAD>Dollar Up In Domestic Trading, Gold Surges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished higher in domestic trading
Wednesday after putting in a mixed performance overseas.
   Gold prices advanced in foreign dealings and then surged when
trading shifted to the United States. On the New York Commodity
Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery jumped $9.50 a troy
ounce to settle at $386. Later, Republic National Bank quoted a
late bid for gold of $383.90, up $8.15 an ounce from Tuesday's late
bid.
   The advance in precious metals prices was attributed to
follow-through buying following the Federal Reserve's move late
Tuesday to trim a key lending rate. The Fed said it will lower the
discount rate, the interest charged on loans to member banks, to
6.5 percent from 7 percent.
   Lower interest rates tend to boost gold prices because they make
it easier for investors to borrow to buy the metal. But lower rates
usually are harmful for the dollar as they erode the value of
fixed-income securities.
   Still, analysts said the dollar remained particularly resilient
in U.S. dealings. Despite the lower interest rates, ``concerns
about the Persian Gulf are discouraging dollar-bears from
selling,'' said Marc Chandler, an analyst at IDEA.
   The dollar also drew support from rumors that the Bank of Japan
was preparing to follow the Fed's lead and lower interest rates.
Lower Japanese rates would be helpful to the dollar as well as U.S.
bonds by widening the rate differential between Japan and the
United States.
   ``The yen was very weak,'' Chandler said, noting that investors
bought the European currencies and sold off their yen.
   Activity was very quiet, and traders predict the coming week
will continue to be slow unless tensions escalate in the Middle
East, said Earl Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust and
Savings Bank in Chicago.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.24 yen to close at 133.27 yen. Later
in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 134.05 yen. In New
York the dollar settled at 134.05 yen, up from 132.72 yen on
Tuesday.
   In London, the British pound slid to $1.9316 from $1.9350 late
Tuesday. In New York it cost $1.9310 to buy one pound, cheaper than
Tuesday's $1.9430.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's rates included: 1.4783 German marks, up from 1.4780;
1.2675 Swiss francs, up from 1.2667; 5.0425 French francs, up from
5.0375; 1,117.75 Italian lire, down from 1,118.00, and 1.1588
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1554.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates included: 1.4780 German marks, down from 1.4840; 1.2690 Swiss
francs, down from 1.2695; 5.0405 French francs, down from 5.0550;
1.6735 Dutch guilders, unchanged; 1,117.25 Italian lire, down from
1,121.25; and 1.1593 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1563.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $380.50 a troy ounce
from $377.50 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a
closing bid of $380 from $377.20 bid. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold
rose 16 cents to close at a bid $377.47.
   Silver prices also rose. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery settled at $4.095 a troy ounce, up from $3.96 on
Tuesday. In London the metal advanced to a late bid price of $4.03
a troy ounce from $3.97.

<HEAD>War Takes Back Seat to Weather on Lethargic Oil Market</HEAD>

   Weather, not war fears, had the biggest impact
on a generally sluggish oil market Wednesday, with unseasonable
warmth in the Northeast depressing natural gas even as a chilly
forecast lifted heating oil.
   Amid lackluster trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
light sweet crude oil settled at $26.93 per barrel, up one penny,
on contracts for delivery in February.
   ``I would call that ominous stability,'' said Philip L. Dodge,
an analyst with Nomura Securities International Inc. ``It suggests
something's going to happen that nobody's anticiating.''
   Brokers have said the market will likely stay quiet through the
holidays, barring major developments in the Persian Gulf.
   Although many oil traders have decided recently that war in the
desert seems more likely than peace, they have not gone on a buying
spree. Oil supplies are adequate and there is a lingering
perception that last-minute diplomacy could defuse the standoff,
sending prices plunging.
   Prices for crude oil have therefore shown no inclination to move
out of the mid $20-per-barrel range in recent sessions.
   ``On fundamentals, it would probably go to $20 a barrel or
below,'' said Stephen Smith, an analyst with Bear Stearns &amp; Co.
``If there was war, it would probably go to $40. It's sitting
halfway in between not knowing where to turn.''
   Without any rumblings of war or peace stirring up the market,
the weather seemed to be taking control on some futures contracts.
   Home heating oil showed the greatest strength Wednesday, rising
2.17 cents to 77.84 cents a gallon on contracts for delivery in
January.
   ``There's been a forecast of Arctic temperatures heading our
way,'' said Thomas P. Blakeslee, an energy analyst at Pegasus
Econometric Group Inc., in Hoboken, N.J. ``It kept prices up.''
   Thus far, the fall has been unseasonably warm, keeping demand
down for heating oil and natural gas.
   Natural gas contracts have plummeted in recent weeks as a
result, and the cold weather hitting much of the nation this week
was not enough to lift them.
   On Wednesday, natural gas for February delivery fell 6.4 cents
to $1.897 per 1,000 cubic feet.
   ``Inventory for natural gas is simply brimming,'' Smith said.
   Unleaded gasoline showed little change, rising .70 cent to 67.42
cents a gallon on contracts for January delivery.

   What would a McDonald's Corp. restaurant
call an experimental submarine sandwich? Obviously, it's the McSub.
   The fast-food giant, which recently beefed up its menu with
pizzas and specialty sandwiches, has given five outlets in this
college town permission to try their luck with the McSubs.
   The test reflects a desire by restaurants near the University of
Wisconsin to find a product tailored to students and is not being
promoted by the corporation, said Carol Koepke, McDonald's regional
marketing manager in Milwaukee.
   ``They were looking for a convenient, portable sandwich for
football games and other activities,'' Ms. Koepke said.
   Many of the McDonald's staples came about in response to
customer needs, she said. For instance, the Big Mac was first sold
in industrial areas of Philadelphia where workers wanted a bigger
sandwich, she said.
   The new sub was developed in conjunction with Oscar Mayer Co.,
which has its headquarters in Madison and supplies the meats in the
sandwich, Ms. Koepke said.
   ``It's a small test operation, but it holds the possibility for
some more business,'' Oscar Mayer spokesman Jim Aehl said.
   The five flavors of a McSub, vegetarian, Italian, ham and
cheese, turkey and turkey combo, range in price from $1.99 to
$2.59. The come in an eight-inch bun and with the standard
submarine fixings of tomatoes, lettuce, onions, and special sauces.
   ``It is a very popular item,'' Ms. Koepke said. ``But it is too
early to tell whether we will roll it out nationally. We tested the
Chicken McNuggets for 10 years before we took it national.''

<HEAD>Lowering of Prime Rate Boosts Gold, Silver</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The decision by the Federal Reserve to reduce its discount rate
helped boost the price of gold and silver Wednesday on New York's
Commodity Exchange.
   On other markets, grain and soybeans were sharply lower,
livestock and pork futures were mixed and energy futures gained.
   Tuesday's cut in the discount rate means the federal government
is trying to stimulate the economy, said Peter Cardillo, director
of commodities research at Jesup, Josephthal &amp; Co. Inc.
   The lowering of the discount rate particularly helped silver and
platinum futures, which had been in a free fall due to concerns
about the economy.
   ``Silver and platinum depend solely on economic conditions,''
Cardillo said. ``If the economy can be lifted, then obviously both
metals will do better because of lower interest rates.''
   Gold traded higher on renewed fears of war in the Persian Gulf.
Those fears were rekindled by Iraqi rhetoric following the European
Community's refusal to meat with Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq
Aziz.
   Also contributing to tensions were reports Iraq is adding to its
forces in Kuwait, as well as a planned meeting between Saudi
Arabian officials and U.S. Defense Secretary Richard Cheney and
Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Gold settled $9.50 to $10.10 higher with the contract for
delivery in February at $388.00 a troy ounce; silver was 13.2 cents
to 14.1 cents higher with December at $4.095 a troy ounce; platinum
was $.50 to $7.70 higher with December at $416.40 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures were lower on the Chicago Board of
Trade as export trade continued to lag behind expectations.
   Helping to push prices lower was news that U.S. and Soviet
officials Tuesday failed to agree on terms of the $500 million to
$1 billion export credit offer made by the United States. The
Soviet Union reportedly wants the credit offer to include the cost
of shipping farm products to the USSR, a condition the United
States is reluctant to agree to.
   Analysts said if the cost of shipping is included, it would
leave the Soviets with less money to purchase grain.
   Soybean futures were heavily pressured by word of a major
purchase of South American soybean meal by the Soviet Union.
   ``So much attention is being paid the lack of business from the
Soviet Union that people are ignoring the fact sales to our
traditional customers - Taiwan, South Korean and Japan - are
down,'' said analyst Joel Karlin of Research Department Inc. in
Chicago, adding that those countries are buying from China, which
had a record crop.
   ``They don't feel the pressure to buy U.S. grains as they have
(felt) in the past,'' Karlin said.
   Wheat was \ cent to 4 cents lower with December at $2.47} a
bushel; corn was 1 cent to 3{ cents lower with December at $2.24 a
bushel; oats were 1\ cent to 1} cents lower with December at $1.05\
a bushel; soybeans were 5\ cents to 7} cents lower with January at
$5.76\ a bushel.
   Energy futures moved higher in quiet trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   Robert Baker, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,
said the market's strength came from a stronger feeling that war
eventually will erupt in the Middle East.
   Light sweet crude was 1 cent to 34 cents higher with February at
$26.93 a barrel; heating oil was .70 cent to 2.17 cents higher with
January at 77.84 a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .41 cent to .70
cent higher with January at 67.42 cents a gallon; natural gas was
.064 cent lower to .010 cent higher with January at $2.046 per
1,000 cubic feet.
   Livestock futures were lower and pork futures higher on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, with cattle prices pressured by lower
cash prices and reduced retail beef demand.
   Frozen pork bellies were up the 2-cent limit as traders took
advantage of the slide in prices in recent trading sessions to
pocket profits.
   Live cattle were .12 cent to .45 cent lower with December at
80.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .50 cent lower
with January at 88.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent to .50
cent lower with February at 49.60 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.88 cents to 2 cents lower with February at 64.10
cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   Kuwaitis have spent $5.64 million for a public
relations firm to promote the country's cause after the Iraqi
invasion on Aug. 2, Justice Department records show.
   The money was paid to Hill &amp; Knowlton Inc., for the period Aug.
20-Nov. 10, according to records the firm filed with the foreign
agents registration office.
   Frank Mankiewicz, a senior Hill &amp; Knowlton executive, said
Wednesday that Kuwait's account was for ``a big job on a big stage
... the assignment is to be effective.''
   Hill &amp; Knowlton disbursed $2.7 million of the $5.64 million,
including $644,571 for video production and $140,412 for travel.
   Citizens for a Free Kuwait, a group that receives most of its
money from the Kuwait government-in-exile, hired Hill &amp; Knowlton to
``provide counsel on a national media program, strategic planning
and message development,'' the records said.
   The public relations firm helped arrange National Free Kuwait
Day, set up interviews for reporters in the United States and Saudi
Arabia, contacted government officials and educators and ``drafted
and disseminated mailings to Congress'' on the Persian Gulf crisis
and human rights issues.
   Since the invasion, Kuwait's government-in-exile, which is based
in Taif, Saudi Arabia, has attempted to draw international
attention to the situation inside Kuwait, particularly the
purported atrocities committed by Iraqi troops.
   Hassan Al-Ebraheem, president of the citizens group, said it has
spent a lot of money on the public relations campaign but ``would
you not do the same for your own country?''
   The $5.64 million Hill &amp; Knowlton received from Kuwait was by
far the largest amount the company was paid by any foreign entity
for the six-month period. The next largest amount was $1.89 million
paid by Mazda Motor Corp.
   Mankiewicz 138 people were registered on the Kuwait account, but
a core group of 75 people spent most of the time on it.
   Rep. James A. Hayes, D-La., said he was distressed by the money
paid by a foreign entity to a public relations firm.
   He said he believed it was wrong for a public relations firm to
be in the middle of a foreign policy debate. In effect, he said
Kuwait, which is prohibited from directly contributing to
congressional campaigns, was buying influence through Hill &amp;
Knowlton.

<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pier 1 Imports Inc. lost $1.7 million
in the third quarter as sales turned sluggish following the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait.
   Pier 1's loss of 5 cents a share came on sales of $145.7 million
during the quarter that ended Dec. 1. During the same quarter a
year ago, Pier 1 earned $5.7 million, or 16 cents a share, on sales
of $131.3 million.
   The sales slump mirrored a drop in business at other retailers
across the country that followed the Iraqi invasion. Consumers have
also been spending cautiously because of the weakening economy.
   Pier 1 said its sales picked up as the holiday shopping season
began.
   For the first nine months of Pier 1's fiscal year, the company
said it earned $8.6 million, or 24 cents a share, on sales of
$433.7 million. That's a 56 percent decline from the 1989
nine-month profit of $19.8 million, or 55 cents a share, on sales
of $380.1 million.

   The sagging economy and retailers' tales
of woe haven't kept holiday gift-givers from packing up cardboard
boxes and sending them to loved ones across the country or to U.S.
troops in Saudi Arabia.
   United Parcel Service, the U.S. Postal Service and Federal
Express Corp. all say their volume has kept up with expectations,
although final numbers won't be known until after Christmas.
   At UPS, where 307 million packages were expected to be sent
between Thanksgiving and Christmas, there are no signs that the
sending of gifts has slacked off this season, said Alan Caminiti, a
spokesman for the Greenwich, Conn.-based company.
   The company projected business would peak this week at 22
million packages a day, twice the normal volume.
   ``We're pretty much right on target,'' Caminiti said. ``Customer
counters have lines around the buildings.''
   Customers are alo standing in lines at post offices across the
country to send packages nationwide and to troops participating in
Operation Desert Shield, said Mark R. Saunders, a Postal Service
spokesman in Washington.
   In the weeks through Dec. 31, the Postal Service expects to
deliver 4 billion cards, letters and packages, Saunders said. About
1 percent of that total - or 40 million - will be parcels.
   He said volume is holding steady with last year at this time,
when the Postal Service delivered as many as 5 million packages and
200 million cards and letters in a single day, Dec. 18.
   Federal Express Corp., which normally delivers 1.3 million
packages a day, could see volume jump by as much as 17 percent a
day in the week before Christmas, said Armand Schneider, spokesman
for the Memphis, Tenn.-based company.
   Company officials made no hard projections about holiday
shipping volume, however, because of the worsening economy.
   ``We knew the economy was soft and we didn't know if it (volume)
would increase at all,'' Schneider said.
   UPS predicted holiday business would be slightly above last
year's totals, Caminiti said. So far its projections are holding
true, with the only surprise a sudden increase - 15-25 percent - in
the number of packages sent by air delivery.
   A national ad campaign touting UPS's air service probably helped
boost the service, he said, but there could be another factor.
   ``The economy aside, society is in a hurry,'' Caminiti said.
   While the volume of holiday packages appears to be consistent
with past years, both Saunders and Caminiti said that can't be
relied upon as an economic indicator.
   There's no way to tell whether those boxes are filled with the
same number of gifts or less expensive items than in years past,
Saunders said.
   ``You can send a gift for $100 and you can send a gift for $10
and it's still a piece of mail,'' he said.
   There has been one economic benefit. To handle the extra volume,
UPS has added 70,000 temporary employees to its work force of
240,000.
   Federal Express relied on its 94,000 regular employees to handle
the job, while the Postal Service used a regular year-round
temporary staff of 21,000 that also works at other busy periods.
   Both Federal Express and UPS said all their Christmas packages
would be delivered by Christmas Eve. If bad weather prevents UPS
from delivering all packages by Christmas Eve, UPS will deliver
them Christmas morning, Caminiti said.
   The Postal Service will also deliver packages Christmas morning
for customers who use its Express Mail Overnight service, Saunders
said. And in some parts of the country, postal carriers dressed as
Santa Claus will hand over the gifts.

<HEAD>Continental Gets Approval to Sell Seattle-Tokyo Route For $150
Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines received a federal
bankruptcy judge's approval Wednesday to sell its prized
Seattle-Tokyo route to healthy rival American Airlines for $150
million.
   The sale was one of a number of actions sanctioned by Judge
Helen Balick. She is overseeing the reorganization of the airline
that sought refuge from creditors Dec. 3 because of crushing debts
and high fuel prices incited by the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The Houston-based airline, which like many companies is
incorporated in Delaware, is among the weaker commercial carriers
in an industry that's under enormous pressure from a slumping
economy that has discouraged air travel.
   Continental had wanted to retain the Seattle-Tokyo route. It is
one of the most profitable because of burgeoning business between
the West Coast and Asia.
   But as the airline's financial problems grew more acute,
management decided the route was expendable and the cash provided
from a sale could be put to better use.
   Continental officials said the proceeds from the sale, which was
first announced shortly after the airline sought bankruptcy
protection, would be used to buy new aircraft it has ordered.
   For American, the route provides a critical gateway to the
Pacific, where the airline will compete directly with United
Airlines, which now dominates U.S.-Asian air travel.
   The route sale still requires Transportation Department
approval.
   In other actions Wednesday, Balick also approved some
preliminary payments to contractors refurbishing Continental's
terminal at New York's LaGuardia airport.
   She agreed to hold a hearing Dec. 28 on the airline's request
for permission to pay some tour operators and travel agents.

<HEAD>Shearson Offers Top Brokers Cash Incentives - If They Stay Five
Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. announced a plan
Wednesday to keep top stockbrokers at the firm by offering up to
$80,000 in annual incentives that can't be cashed in for five
years.
   Shearson follows Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in revamping its
compensation program during a period of slumping retail brokerage
activity across Wall Street that has made stockbrokers more willing
to take other jobs.
   Under the Shearson program, brokers and branch managers who have
completed five years of consecutive service and meet production
criteria will receive 4 percent of their gross production up to a
maximum $80,000.
   After that, employees in the program will be eligible for awards
of 1 percent to 5 percent of gross production annually, again up to
a maximum $80,000 a year. To qualify, brokers must increase their
production by certain percentages over a previous three-year
average.
   The brokers cannot receive the money before five years, a move
preventing those who qualify from leaving the firm and taking the
bonus. The cash, however, will earn interest. Also, Shearson said
it can revoke an award under certain conditions depending on a
broker's performance.
   ``It's golden handcuffs is what it amounts to,'' said Lawrence
Eckenfelder, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in
San Francisco.
   ``When things are slow is when you tend to lose more people,''
he said. ``When business is good brokers are always less inclined
to leave.''
   For branch managers and brokers with the highest levels of
production, 25 percent of the incentive awards will consist of
stock in American Express Co., Shearson's parent. During the
five-year waiting period, employees will receive cash dividend
payments on the stock.
   Last week, Merrill Lynch said it would give a certificate to
each of its 10,500 brokers that could be worth up to $100,000 if
they remain at the firm for 10 years.
   Unlike Merrill, though, Shearson said it is not changing its
method of commission payouts that comprise compensation for its
9,000 brokers. Merrill said newly hired, inexperienced brokers
would receive salaries in their first two years.
   ``It's incentive to stay and do quality business and to stay and
be productive,'' said Joseph J. Plumeri, president of Shearson's
private client group. ``It was never on our mind to keep people
from leaving.''
   Shearson said in a statement it was forming a board that would
review every award recommendation against a set of guidelines based
on ``superior client service, integrity, quality, ethics and
teamwork.'' The board will consist of senior managers, including
Shearson Lehman Brothers President Jonathan S. Linen.
   Analysts said the compensation incentives by Merrill and
Shearson, the nation's top two brokerage firms, marked a change.
Typically, Wall Street firms give annual bonuses to brokers based
on production levels.
   Eckenfelder said the programs were cheaper than recruiting
top-flight brokers from other firms with large bonuses. He also
said that reducing attrition among top brokers could help improve
the firm's bottom line.

   Hewlett-Packard Co. said Wendesday it
has restructured its computer division and expanded its presence in
the semiconductor test equipment business by agreeing to buy
Applied Optoelectronic Technology Corp.
   Hewlett-Packard, which posted $13.2 billion in revenues in its
1990 fiscal year, also said it will focus more resources on the
telecommunication market.
   Hewlett-Packard's revamping of its Computer Systems Organization
follows a companywide reorganization of executive responsibilities
announced Oct. 5.
   Under the computer reorganization, four groups - computer
systems, workstations, information networks and engineering
applications - were merged into two groups.
   Willem P. Roelandts, former general manager of the computer
systems group, heads one of the new groups, Networked Systems. The
group is responsible for developing and marketing workstations,
minicomputers, RISC technology, core networking, operating systems,
languages, databases and computer integration.
   Robert J. Frankenberg, former general manager of the information
networks group, heads the new Cooperative Computing Group, which is
responsible for developing and marketing distributed computing
applications, user interfaces, and office and personal network
products.
   Roelandts and Frankenberg will continue to report to Lewis E.
Platt, head of Computer Systems.
   ``Our simplified structure will help us speed products to
market,'' Platt said.
   The deal with privately held Applied Optoelectronic Technology
(AOT), based in Milpitas, is expected to be completed in late
January. Terms were not disclosed.
   AOT, an 11-year-old company with under $10 million in 1990
revenue, designs and produces automatic test equipment for
semiconductor manufacturers. The equipment, which integrates
computers and instrumentation, tests devices during the
manufacturing process.
   AOT also makes systems that test smart-power modules. These
modules incorporate control functions for making decisions and
power functions for performing tasks, such as adjusting the speed
of a car's motor or activating electronic door locks.
   In autos, smart-power integrated circuits can regulate anti-lock
brakes, adjust the suspension based on the weight of passengers and
sense tire pressure.
   Robert I. Chen, AOT's president and founder and a former
Hewlett-Packard employee, will continue to head the company. AOT,
which sells systems and instruments to several of the world's
leading automotive companies, will operate under its own name as a
division of Hewlett-Packard.
   Hewlett-Packard's acquisition of AOT is part of a strategy to
become a bigger player in semiconductor test equipment.

<HEAD>Taj Mahal Must Present Financial Forecasts To Commission</HEAD>

   Donald Trump's Taj Mahal hotel and
casino has to give its financial forecasts for the next five years
to state gaming regulators, the state Casino Control Commission
ruled Wednesday.
   The commission said in its ongoing hearings on the financial
stability of the 8{-month-old Taj Mahal that the casino must
present its monthly forecasts for 1991 and quarterly predictions
for the years 1992-95.
   The Taj Mahal must also submit fully executed documents to the
commission that show how it plans to implement agreements with its
lenders, Commission Chairman Steve Perskie said.
   Perskie said he anticipates conducting the next hearing on the
Taj Mahal sometime in January after the commission can study all
the data. The commission has the power to take away a license if it
finds the casino operator is financially unstable.
   Trump attorney Nicholas Ribis said he expected the financial
forecasts and the documents would be ready by Dec. 28.
   The commission's hearings are looking at the stability of the
Taj Mahal, which renegotiated its $675 million debt one day after
failing to make a $47.3 million payment Nov. 15.
   The casino intends to file a ``pre-packaged'' bankruptcy under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and leave bankruptcy
protection by spring. The Taj Mahal's restructuring would give
bondholders half ownership in the Taj Mahal in exchange for
accepting a lower interest rate, 12 percent instead of 14 percent.

<HEAD>Congressmen Urge Federal Regulators to Review AT&amp;T Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fourteen Ohio congressmen on Wednesday urged
federal regulators to scrutinize American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co.'s $6.1 billion takeover bid for NCR Corp.
   The legislators claim the merger could be anti-competitive and
result in higher telephone rates.
   ``If the merger does not work, the costs of repaying the $6
billion which AT&amp;T is borrowing is likely to be borne by
long-distance telephone consumers,'' the congressmen said in a
letter to the Federal Communications Commission.
   In their letter to Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, the
lawmakers warned that the merger could give AT&amp;T ``the potential to
develop an unfair advantage'' in the financial services sector.
   U.S. Rep. Tony Hall, the Democrat who spearheaded the effort,
said the letters are ``part of a counterstrike by the delegation to
block the takeover, which is strongly opposed by local Ohio
government and business leaders.''
   Also signing the letters were Democratic Reps. Louis Stokes,
Douglas Applegate, Thomas Luken, Edward Feighan, Marcy Kaptur, Mary
Rose Oakar, Donald Pease and James Traficant, and Republican Reps.
Michael Oxley, Bob McEwen, Michael DeWine and Paul Gillmor. Rep.
John Kasich, a Republican, signed only the letter the Justice
Department.
   There are 21 congressional districts in Ohio.
   AT&amp;T's $90-per-share cash tender offer was rejected unanimously
by NCR's board.
   AT&amp;T has said it will try to persuade stockholders to call a
special meeting and seek to oust the Dayton, Ohio-based computer
maker's board of directors.

   Directors of the nation's second largest
independent oil company Wednesday abandoned efforts to sell the
firm because they received no acceptable bids.
   Insead, the board of Union Texas Petroleum Holdings Inc.
decided to try to sell the company's U.S. onshore and offshore
exploration and production businesses and its hydrocarbon products
businesses.
   That would leave only the company's international exploration
and production businesses, said spokeswoman Carol Cox.
   A company statement said Union Texas would also pursue ``other
restructuring alternatives,'' but Ms. Cox declined comment on the
alternatives.
   ``No assurance can be given that the activities will result in
any transaction,'' a statement from the Houston-based company said.
   The announcement briefly halted trading in Union Texas stock on
the New York Stock Exchange. Union Texas stock closed at $15 a
share Wednesday, down $1.
   Union Texas's board announced April 30 the company was on the
block, and analysts said at the time it could sell for as much as
$2.25 billion.
   If Union Texas had sold for the expected price of $25 a share,
Kohlberg Kravis &amp; Roberts, a leverage buyout specialist that owns
40 percent of the company, could have earned a profit of about $750
million on stock bought five years ago at $7.50 a share.
   Allied Signal Inc., the aerospace and automotive parts
conglomerate, owns another 40 percent, also has said it was
interested in selling its Union Texas holdings.
   Union Texas owns 38 percent of the largest natural gas producer
in Indonesia, one of the hottest exploration areas in the world. It
also has crude oil production and exploration operations in the
North Sea, Gulf of Mexico and a 42 percent interest and joint
operation of an ethylene plant in Geismar, La., near Baton Rouge.

<HEAD>Union Approves Concessions to Keep Briggs Jobs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Union workers at small-engine and lock maker
Briggs &amp; Stratton Corp. voted Wednesday to accept wage cuts and
other concessions to keep their jobs from being transferred south.
   Members of Allied Industrial Workers Local 232, which represents
some 6,000 workers at Briggs' plants in Milwaukee, voted 2,512 to
2,246 to accept the concessions.
   The concessions include a $2 an hour wage cut for the 1,200
workers in the small engine division, increased health insurance
costs for workers and elimination of a company-wide profit sharing
program.
   In exchange for the concessions, the company promised not to
move any of its engine or lock work out of its suburban Milwaukee
plant at least until July 1994.
   Briggs had threatened to move the jobs to plants in Kentucky or
Indiana if the Milwaukee workers did not accept the wage cuts.
   ``We were very disappointed about it. They were holding a club
above our members' heads. We accepted it because the priority is
job security,'' Local 232 President Dick Crofter said.
   Briggs Chief Executive Frederick P. Stratton issued a brief
statement after the union vote indicating the company hopes to
improve relations with the union.
   Workers in the small-engine division average about $14 an hour,
according to figures supplied by Local 232 of the Allied Industrial
Workers. Those employees also receive fringe benefits valued at
about $5.75 an hour.
   A southern facility would eliminate transportation costs to
Briggs customers, many of whom are now in the South, officials
said.
