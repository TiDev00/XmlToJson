<HEAD>Flooding Continues in South; Winter Sends Last Blast Through East</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 5th graf, `Gov. Guy...,' to UPDATE with Hunt requesting
disaster aid for 25 other counties.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   Flood waters forced people from their homes in Georgia and
Florida on Monday, and snakes swam past evacuated houses in
Alabama. But the heat wave that accompanied the deadly Southern
floods was replaced by a snowy blast of winter.
   More than 150 National Guard military police officers patrolled
the streets of Elba, Ala., where an earthen levee ruptured Saturday
after 16 inches of rain pounded the town over two preceeding days.
   Water stood window-high on houses, but many of the 2,000
residents evacuated from the town began returning to their homes to
salvage belongings.
   Insurance adjusters began assessing claims, but officials said
it may take federal and state money to cover the losses of
businessmen and residents whose property lay below the levee on the
swollen Pea River.
   Gov. Guy Hunt requested federal disaster aid for Coffee County,
which includes Elba, and 25 of Alabama's other 66 counties. But he
said he hoped President Bush would act on the Coffee declaration
first because of the severe destruction in Elba.
   Although no one was killed in Elba, at least 11 people lost
their lives because of flooding elsewhere in southern Alabama. More
than 3,800 people were evacuated from their homes because of
flooding along the Alabama, Conecuh, Pea, Choctawhatchee, and
Chattahoochee rivers.
   In Geneva, Ala., near the Florida border, flood waters continued
to rise but officials said the earthen levee there appeared to he
holding.
   Margaret Mixon, a spokeswoman for the local Emergency Management
Agency, said there was some seepage through the levee Sunday night,
``but we have that all under control now. ... We feel like we're
over the worst part unless we have some bad luck with the levee.''
   Throughout southern Alabama, the high waters flushed out snakes,
which could be seen swimming through inundated neighborhoods.
   Flood waters rose in central Georgia as streams and rivers
swollen from heavy weekend rains gushed south, forcing more people
from their homes and businesses.
   The Ocmulgee River, with a flood stage of 18 feet, reached 29.5
feet Monday morning and was nearing a crest of about 30 feet, said
National Weather Service hydrologist Russell Post.
   The river flooded the entrance to Central City Park in Macon and
swept across one of the city's main streets.
   The Flint River at Montezuma, Ga., was on its way to an expected
crest of 26 feet Tuesday, which would be its highest since at least
1971, Post said. He said the town's 31.5-foot levee was protecting
the city's downtown and neighboring Oglethorpe, but some residents
were being evacuated.
   Six people died in flood-related accidents over the weekend in
Georgia.
   In the Florida Panhandle, more than 1,200 people were evacuated
as of Monday, including all 630 residents of Caryville, a town on
the Choctawhatchee River, authorities said.
   State officials closed a 20-mile stretch of Interstate 10, from
Bonifay to DeFuniak Springs, and rerouted traffic during the
afternoon because of concern about erosion around supports for the
highway's bridge over the Choctawhatchee.
   The heavy rains in the South coincided with summer-like weather
across the East. But on Monday, the last day of winter, cold rain
and snow began spreading south.
   ``It's one last gasp from Old Man Winter, who came down out of
Canada,'' said Rich Heller of the Accu-Weather forecasting service
in Nashville, Tenn., where residents awoke to a coating of heavy,
wet snow on Monday.
   Spring begins Tuesday at 4:19 p.m. EST.

<HEAD>ISU Carillon Tolls 60 Times for Terry Anderson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A somber tolling of the campus carillon at
Iowa State University on Monday marked the five years ISU graduate
Terry Anderson has been held hostage in Lebanon.
   Yellow ribbons were tied around trees outside the school's
Memorial Union and posters with Anderson's picture proclaimed, ``We
have not forgotten.''
   But most students, just back from spring break, went about their
business on campus without stopping for the noon ceremony. Some,
noticing television news crews, asked reporters, ``What's going
on?''
   Anderson, a 1974 journalism and political science graduate of
ISU and a former Des Moines broadcaster, is chief Middle East
correspondent for the Associated Press. Anderson was taken hostage
in Beirut on March 16, 1985, and is the longest held western
hostage in Lebanon.
   The ISU ceremony marking the fifth anniversary of his capture
was delayed from Friday to Monday to wait for students to return to
the central Iowa campus from spring break.
   The carillon tolled 60 times, about once each 10 seconds, to
mark the months Anderson has spent in captivity.

<HEAD>Sportswear Inspires Chanel, Dior Shows For Winter</HEAD>

   From dressy ski parkas for evening at Chanel to
silk-clad jockeys at Dior, designers are showing luxury
ready-to-wear fashions for winter inspired by sportswear.
   Chanel's designer Karl Lagerfeld on Monday introduced sporty
dress-up outfits sizzling with new primary colors. The current
Chanel silhouette demands slim legs.
   ``Lagerfeld has liberated women, with wonderful cuts and new
colors,'' said Lynn Manulis, owner of Martha's boutiques. ``I think
it's great.''
   Lagerfeld pushed his New Age minis to the extreme and abandoned
skirts altogether in some outfits, announcing in his program that
``skirts are on their way out.''
   His jackets were superb. Lagerfeld showed some wonderful hot-red
tweeds heavily piped in red, white and blue galloon braiding along
with dressy bright cashmere jackets with black chenille and gold
baroque embroidery.
   The ski-slope idea for dressing up was fine in puffy royal blue
or red satin quilted boleros or anoraks paired with chenille
stretch pants. The jackets bore the trademark Chanel gold buttons.
   At Dior, Gianfranco Ferre took his audience on a trip to the
racetrack or back to the l9th century in dandy-coachmen's styles.
Jockeys' silks teamed with jodhpurs and boots and bicolored taffeta
stoles are aimed at the winner's circle.
   Ferre's day wear often featured beautifully cut gray flannel
redingotes or riding coats, dressed up with Ferre's favorite top
hat for the carriage trade.
   They made nice coat dresses served up with satin stocks at the
necks or teamed with lean long pants for elegant suits.
   Ferre was seeing crimson red everywhere: as linings for capes
and underskirts in fitted suits, in belted full coats over pencil
pants, and as flared pyramid shortie coats worn with nude-shaded
tights with high heels.
   And he brought back full long skirts as a wonderful way to be
comfortable at home, in a gored, buttoned up ottoman carmine silk
skirt with a ribbed knit body stocking, or beautiful gold or ruby
satin sashed lounging-coat tea gowns, split over matching tapered
pants.
   Jean-Louis Scherrer's lively show uncaged his wild-animal
themes, and nobody does it better than Scherrer. His fitted
shimmering jackets stitched like alligator patterns or printed like
snakeskin were handsome.
   His blond daughter and star model, Laetitia, paraded with her
new adopted stray dog, a huge black Great Dane looking elegantly
dignified.
   As everywhere else, Scherrer used some sportswear to advantage,
in duffel-coat styles fastened with thongs and bobbins or chain
bits, in shiny, quilted and hooded toppers in hot colors. Paisley
was another plus in slim pants and fitted jackets.
   Hanae Mori, celebrating her 35 years in fashion with a
retrospective exhibition of her work at the Pavillon des Arts, gave
her winter styles a rejuvenating shot in the arm.
   Her fitted leather suits with skirts way above the knee, knits
in cloud or black and white patterns and fuzzy Mongolian short
coats combined youthful appeal with sophistication.
   She also used some current favorite Paris themes for her boxy or
fitted suits with long jackets in tapestry weaves with elegant fur
trimmings in chinchilla jackets or fox hoods.
   Also on Monday, it was announced that Yves Saint Laurent was
hospitalized at the American Hospital for what a doctor described
as ``intellectual exhaustion,'' and would be unable to attend his
show Wednesday. Saint Laurent, 53, had been advised to rest for
several weeks, said Dr. Michael Prendeville.

<HEAD>Glasnost May Be Too Late for East German Press</HEAD>

   Glasnost may have come too late for East
Germany's dull, dowdy newspapers and magazines.
   Only a few months after the revolution allowed journalists to
switch from the Communist Party line to more balanced reporting,
the press faces a second upheaval: West German publishers are
trying to woo Eastern readers with racy reporting and gloss.
   The four mightiest representatives of West German journalism _
Axel Springer Verlag, Gruener und Jahr, Bauer and Burda _ began
distributing their papers and magazines throughout East Germany
this month.
   Gruener und Jahr's Hamburg headquarters said the publishers
delivered 100,000 copies on the first day of sales.
   East German journalists knew when the orthodox Communist
government of Erich Honecker fell in October that ``we'd be faced
with free-market competition, that we'd have to adopt more
competitive practices,'' said Matthias Schlegel, deputy editor of
the daily Neue Zeit.
   His paper, with a circulation of 150,000 and a price of 20
pfennigs (12 cents) has survived only with state support.
   ``We're worried we won't be able to survive economically,''
Schlegel said. ``It's a real question for our existence,'' he said.
   All East German papers plan to raise prices April 1. Neue Zeit
will go up to 55 pfennigs (31 cents).
   East Germans usually could receive West German television, but
printed material from the West was kept out for years.
   Then, early this month, the West German publishers put street
vendors to work around East Berlin's Alexanderplatz selling such
journals as the mass-circulation Bild Zeitung, conservative daily
Die Welt, news magazines Der Spiegel and Stern, and a wide range of
fashion and sports magazines.
   Roland Vogel, a distribution official for Springer, publisher of
Bild-Zeitung, said most of the vendors were sold out by lunchtime
every day.
   For the regular vendors in the state-controlled system, it's a
different story.
   ``We still can't sell Western papers; there's still been no
agreement on prices,'' said a man who runs a stand at the
Alexanderplatz subway station, as he tidied old copies of Cuba
International and the Czechoslovak Motor Review.
   Because the Communist-led interim government has not set the
terms for distribution through the regular system, West German
publishers decided to use street vendors, supermarkets and bakeries.
   Most of the Western publications are priced at an exchange rate
of three East German marks for one West German mark. That means,
for example, that Der Spiegel would cost 13.50 East marks, the
equivalent of $7.65.
   A 24-year-old student, who identified himself only as Dieter,
said the Western journals were ``simply too expensive'' for him. He
bought copies of the Communist Party daily Neues Deutschland and
youth paper Junge Welt at an Alexanderplatz kiosk.
   Juergen Ludwig, a railroad worker from Erfurt, took the opposite
view: ``I don't think they're that expensive and the quality is
definitely better, especially with the magazines.''
   At a nearby booth, Jacqueline Hoffmann sold subscriptions to
Berliner Morgenpost, a Springer paper.
   ``We're offering subscriptions at 19.40 marks ($11) a month at a
guaranteed 1-to-1 rate until currency union comes,'' she said.
``People are a bit skeptical because they don't know the paper .. .
but we've sold 40 subscriptions today.''
   Economic union of the two Germanys, in which the West German
mark is expected to replace the non-convertible East German
currency, is seen as the first step toward political reunification.
   East Germans prefer subscriptions to buying single copies of
papers. They account for more than 90 percent of circulation for
Neue Zeit, Schlegel's paper.
   Resisting the Western deluge will not be easy for East German
papers, most of which use old, labor-intensive production methods.
   Schlegel said there may be a spate of takeovers by West German
press barons jockeying for market position, and that small regional
or local papers might be targets.
   The East German news agency ADN, which surprised Western
journalists with its rapid change to fast, reliable reporting, is
said to be planning a merger with the West German agency DPA.
   Tageszeitung, a West German tabloid, has set up in East Berlin
to print a separate Eastern edition.

<HEAD>`Red October' Still No. 1; `Night on Fire' Wins Lambada War at Box

   The ratings dance of two instant lambada films
failed to displace ``The Hunt for Red October'' as the nation's
favorite movie.
   ``Red October,'' starring Sean Connery as a renegade Soviet
submarine commander, collected $11.1 million for first place,
according to figures released Monday by Exhibitor Relations Co.
   Neither ``Lambada: Set the Night on Fire'' nor ``The Forbidden
Dance'' ground out spectacular turnstile business. ``Lambada: Set
the Night on Fire'' finished in eighth, while ``Forbidden Dance''
could not gyrate into the Top 10.
   In second was the romantic comedy ``Joe vs. the Volcano,''
starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, with ticket sales of $7 million.
It was followed in third by director Harry Hook's remake of the
1963 film ``Lord of the Flies,'' which collected $4.4 million.
   ``House Party,'' the lighthearted teen sex comedy, was fourth,
grossing $3.6 million in its second week of release. The
independent film has now made $9.3 million.
   Opening poorly in fifth place was ``Blue Steel,'' with a gate of
$2.89 million in wide release. The blood-splattered movie looks at
a rookie police officer (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her relationship
with an attractive man (Ron Silver) who doubles as a psychopathic
killer.
   In sixth was ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' with Jessica Tandy and
Morgan Freeman, on receipts of $2.87 million. ``Bad Influence,''
starring Rob Lowe, fell 32 percent to seventh place with sales of
$2.6 million.
   ``Lambada: Set the Night on Fire,'' starring J. Eddie Peck,
grossed $2 million. Playing in wider release than ``The Forbidden
Dance'' (which made $720,864 or $1,132 per screen), ``Set the Night
on Fire'' also had a superior per-screen average of $1,818.
   Landing in ninth was Steven Seagal's ``Hard to Kill,'' on
revenues of $1.8 million. Rounding out the Top 10 was director
Oliver Stone's ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' which made $1.2
million.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Sunday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.
   1. ``The Hunt for Red October,'' Paramount, $11.1 million, 1,817
screens, $6,097 per screen, $53.9 million, three weeks.
   2. ``Joe vs. the Volcano,'' Warner Bros., $7 million, 1,799
screens, $3,901 per screen, $18.9 million, one week.
   3. ``Lord of the Flies,'' Columbia, $4.4 million, 888 screens,
$4,967 per screen, $4.4 million, one week.
   4. ``House Party,'' New Line, $3.6 million, 550 screens, $6,491
per screen, $9.3 million, two weeks.
   5. ``Blue Steel,'' MGM-UA, $2.89 million, 1,307 screens, $2,216
per screen, $2.89 million, one week.
   6. ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' Warner Bros., $2.87 million, 1,353
screens, $2,124 per screen, $69.6 million, 14 weeks.
   7. ``Bad Influence,'' Epic, $2.6 million, 1,300 screens, $2,000
per screen, $7.7 million, two weeks.
   8. ``Lambada: Set the Night on Fire,'' Warner Bros., $2 million,
1,117 screens, $1,818 per screen, $2 million, one week.
   9. ``Hard to Kill,'' Warner Bros., $1.8 million, 1,265 screens,
$1,447 per screen, $39.9 million, six weeks.
   10. ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' Universal, $1.2 million,
1,030 screens, $1,205 per screen, $63.6 million, 13 weeks.

<HEAD>Sandinistas Dominate Stage, Even in Defeat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Even in defeat, the Sandinistas
dominate the stage in Nicaragua.
   Three weeks after the United National Opposition ousted the
Sandinistas with a resounding 55 percent of the vote, UNO
supporters still have not held a public celebration.
   UNO officials have steered cleared of the government agencies
they must start running on April 25. They have yet to get a look at
the books of the state-run enterprises they hope to privatize.
   ``A couple of guys wanted to go down to the ministries, but I
told them, `No, you could get killed,''' said labor leader Alvin
Guthrie, a UNO deputy-elect to the National Assembly. ``I told them
just be prudent. Take it easy.''
   President Daniel Ortega has been sending mixed signals in speech
after speech, saying the Sandinistas will defend the gains of the
revolution while giving up power, while President-elect Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro has been virtually invisible.
   The shape of her Cabinet and her policies are still unclear, as
is the balance of power in her 14-party coalition. Mrs. Chamorro,
60, has had only one short news conference since the Feb. 25
general election.
   Ortega has been at the forefront, issuing warnings of
insurrection and civil war one day, then calmly assuring Vice
President Dan Quayle that the Sandinistas will give up power.
   A climate of uncertainty and impatience prevails, despite the
lifting last week of the U.S. economic embargo that had severed
Nicaragua from its traditional markets and strangled its sources of
credit.
   By the end of the week, a U.S. dollar fetched 120,000 cordobas,
the Nicaraguan currency, on the black market. That's nearly double
the black market rate in the weeks just before the election and
more than double the 54,000 official rate.
   The business community, although buoyed by the end of the
five-year embargo and a $300 million aid package President Bush is
requesting from Congress, is cautious.
   ``After the 25th'' has become a kind of refrain in business
circles.
   In their waning days of exclusive power, the Sandinistas have
been at turns threatening, defensive, contrite and conciliatory.
   All eyes are upon them as they prepare to ``govern from below,''
simultaneously maneuvering for position in transition talks with
UNO, shoring up their power base and taking steps to block any
conservative counterreforms.
   They have handed out thousands of guns, rallied their rank and
file, passed an amnesty covering a decade of revolutionary rule and
drafted a law legalizing the confiscations of thousands of homes,
farms and vehicles.
   Nothing of substance has emerged publicly from the transition
talks, where dismantling U.S.-supported Contra rebels and control
of the army, police and state security apparatus are critical
issues.
   But the Sandinistas have made it clear that while they may give
up the government, they won't give up their guns.
   In his most troubling speech to date, Ortega said that if the
Contras haven't demobilized by April 25, the day UNO is scheduled
to take over, the country would rise up in arms.
   ``It is like the calm before the storm,'' he said. ``We have to
avoid being crushed by the tempest of civil war, popular
insurrection, violence.''
   The Contras, for their part, continue to insist they won't put
down their weapons until Mrs. Chamorro is in office and they feel
it's safe to return from their base camps in Honduras.
   ``We're going to remain at arms to guarantee that the people get
everything people vote for _ a change in the government and a
change in their lives,'' said Contra field commander Denis Galeano
Conejo.
   Ortega has also said that people ready to ``defend the conquests
of the revolution,'' which the Sandinistas define as everything
from milk for children to confiscated property to government jobs.
   Experience has taught the Sandinistas, who took power in the
1979 revolution that ended the Somoza family dictatorship, how to
function as a clandestine movement and what it is like hold the
reins of power.
   Now they must learn a new role: an opposition party. Sandinistas
insiders admit it is a part they were not expecting to play.
   ``Any other political party in any other part of the world would
not have gone to elections early,'' said Ray Hooker, a Sandinista
deputy in the National Assembly. ``It was a kind of hubris on our
part.''
   Part of the adjustment appears to be taking place in Ortega's
wardrobe.
   He showed up at the inauguration of Chile's President Patricio
Alywin last week in a dark suit and tie, a contrast to the
technicolor shirts he wore on the campaign trail and an even
greater contrast to the uniforms he wore for years to symbolize his
country's mobilization against the Contras.
   Despite defeat, the Sandinistas are well-positioned to block the
complete dismantling of their leftist revolution.
   Although UNO won a 52-seat majority in the 92-seat National
Assembly, it is three seats short of the number it needs to amend
the Constitution.
   The Sandinistas also will maintain control of the Supreme Court,
which would hear any challenges to the Constitution, until 1993,
halfway through Mrs. Chamorro's term.
   ``There will be a permanent process of negotiation,'' said
Alfredo Cesar, Chamorro's principle adviser.
   UNO officials fear the Sandinistas are quietly gutting public
institutions and will leave them nothing but the shell of a state
structure.
   Vice President Sergio Ramirez heatedly denied the suggestion
last week. He said audits were under way in all public institutions
and challenged anyone with proof of wrongdoing to present it to the
republic's controller and attorney general.
   ``We believe these slanderous and irresponsible accusations are
not contributing to an orderly and peaceful climate for the
transfer of government,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   When Igor Lukashuk opens an American law book, he
sees the future of the Soviet Union.
   Lukashuk, a prominent international law expert, hopes his
research on American constitutional law, carefully recorded in a
big black notebook, will act as a catalyst in shaping his country's
new political system.
   ``The future (Communist) Party will be like your system,'' the
63-year-old Muscovite said. ``It would suit us perfectly _ a (two)
party system, two parties that are different but really the same.''
   Lukashuk is teaching Soviet law at Emory University in a newly
established visiting professorship, believed to be the first time a
Soviet academic institution is staffing an American university on a
continual basis.
   It took two years of negotiations and a letter from former
President Jimmy Carter urging Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to
endorse the program, but the professorship was established last
fall with the Institute of State and Law of the USSR Academy of
Sciences.
   Lukashuk, a frequent United Nations delegate, welcomed the
chance to study how ``typical Americans'' are treated by their
political system.
   But he spends most of his time answering questions, from crowds
of students and journalists who flock to his office, rather than
asking them. An enthusiastic ``I explain you why'' punctuates his
conversations.
   ``All the time people ask me about Gorbachev, if I'm a
Communist,'' said the longtime Communist Party member.
   ``I believe in Gorbachev, he's a gifted man,'' he added. ``But
according to Marxism, socialism develops due to contradictions. But
there are no contradictions with only one party.''
   Lukashuk is asked frequently how he likes the United States. He
is careful not to criticize, but will say he thinks Americans are a
little too arrogant.
   ``I can't agree with your president that the world needs the
leadership of the U.S.,'' he explained. ``Tomorrow will be a
welfare world. It's not possible to make a secure world if the U.S.
is inventing butter without fat while other people are starving.''
   Lukashuk is also critical of the Soviet political system he's
trying to change, saying it destroyed his country's economy and
contributed to ethnic violence in Armenia and Azerbaijan and calls
for independence by the Baltic republics.
   ``For five years we supported perestroika, but still we must
eat,'' he said. ``They must make the first steps so that in
February it is just a bit better than January.''
   Making Gorbachev's policy of perestroika, or restructuring, work
lies in finding out what makes systems such as those of the United
States and Great Britain work, Lukashuk said. That's his goal.
   And even though he says he can do more research in Atlanta in
three months than in Moscow in a year, he's having a hard time
fitting work into his schedule. People keep calling, asking for
interviews or inviting him to parties. Lukashuk said he just can't
turn anyone down, especially not students.
   ``They are understandable in law, understandable in life, of
humor, jokes,'' Lukashuk said. ``I must say they are more sincere,
more open than students in other countries. They are the future of
the world community.''

<TEXT>
   In the old days, East Germans never dared
step on the huge lawn in front of Communist Party headquarters, the
ominous center of power where 2,000 functionaries controlled every
detail of national life.
   After the ouster of the hard-line leaders last fall, East
Berliners began to reclaim the grass for picnics and sunbathing.
Sightseers would casually stroll up the steps of the huge, gray,
seven-story building.
   Now, in the final transition from dictatorship to democracy, the
party is moving out of what was known as the ``house of the
thousand telephones.''
   The former Communist fortress will now provide office space for
the 400 members of Parliament elected Sunday in East Germany's
first free vote. The deadline for moving out is April 1.
   Today, few reminders are left of the once omnipotent party.
Silence has descended on the 820 rooms and miles upon miles of
linoleum-lined corridors that once bustled with bureaucrats.
   The bronze busts of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels that guarded
the inner portals have been carted up to the attic, where they
joined discarded, poster-sized, official photographs of ousted
party chief Erich Honecker.
   The 16-foot-high oval party emblem on the right side of the
facade was removed by workers in January after the Communists
pledged reform and renamed themselves the Party of Democratic
Socialism.
   The reformed party, as a symbol of change, has decorated the
facade with rows of colorful paintings by West Berlin artists.
During the election party on Sunday, children romped through the
grand hall on the ground floor as their parents drank beer and
cheered the new party leaders, reformers Gregor Gysi and Prime
Minister Hans Modrow.
   ``The old party apparatus has been smashed, and now people
actually like to come here and enjoy themselves,'' said Sylvia
Graefe, 39, a party archivist speaking in her small basement office.
   Only six months ago, the closely guarded party fortress
symbolized how isolated the ruling regime had become from the
population after 41 years of totalitarian rule.
   Honecker and the 20 other members of the ruling Politburo
occupied offices on the second floor, to which only selected
employees had access. Even they needed special identification cards
with two red stripes and had to pass numerous security guards
before reaching the inner sanctum.
   Mrs. Graefe recalled that ordinary party workers would sometimes
be called up to the second floor to provide a cheering section for
foreign visitors, a practice that employees referred to as the
``clapping detail.''
   ``Five minutes before the visitor arrived, Honecker would emerge
from his room and make a little small talk with us, maybe talk
about the weather. When the visitor came, Honecker would embrace
him, we clapped, and then the two disappeared into Honecker's
office,'' she said.
   The leaders of the party that espoused equality and brotherhood
always remained aloof from the rank-and-file Communists, said Mrs.
Graefe.
   Politburo members used a private wood-paneled elevator, while
party employees moved up and down in a crude elevator without
doors. Politburo members lunched in an executive dining room on the
seventh floor, while Mrs. Graefe and others stood in line with
plastic trays in the ground-floor cafeteria.
   Party official Jutta Boehm, who for 10 years headed the
Politburo's typing pool, blamed the self-imposed isolation of the
77-year-old Honecker and his ruling clique of old men for the
collapse of the regime.
   ``If they had been a little more accessible, things would be
different today,'' said Mrs. Boehm.
   The party's membership has shrunk from 2.5 million to about
600,000 since October.

   Occasionally, an art theft reads like the plot
from an Ian Fleming thriller in which half-mad billionaires pay
slick international thieves to steal famous paintings for their
private pleasure.
   In reality, experts said Monday, most art is stolen to earn a
quick buck in an international black market that is second in size
only to the drug trade.
   The priceless art stolen Sunday from the Isabella Stewart
Gardner Museum is too famous to be sold anywhere, raising the
spectre that the pieces could be held hostage for ransom for a
fraction of the hundreds of millions of dollars the art world says
the paintings are worth.
   The true scale of the art underworld is difficult to gauge, but
investigators say art thievery is increasing as prices for works on
the legal market soar.
   ``There's a lot of it going on,'' said Robert W. Holmes Jr., a
Boston attorney specializing in fine art transactions. ``Ninety
percent of stolen art is never recovered. There's obviously a
market there.''
   Rarely, one end of the market is held up by someone who decides
to commission the theft of a painting that cannot be legitimately
acquired.
   One such theft occurred in 1983, when thieves stole Italian
Renaissance masterpieces, including Raphael's self portrait, from
the Hungarian national museum in Budapest.
   Investigators found that a sophisticated band of Italian art
thieves, armed with cutting tools and high-tech alarm-busting
devices, executed a perfect break-in and vanished with the works.
   An extensive dragnet eventually snared the thieves in their home
country before they could get the paintings to Greece where, it was
later found, an olive oil baron had paid a handsome sum for the
sake of having the works hang in his home.
   ``There aren't many thieves with that sort of expertise,'' said
Robert Volpe, a former New York City police detective who worked on
the Hungarian case and is now a private consultant tracing stolen
art around the world. ``They were capable of stealing anything.''
   But most of the black market in art is in lesser-known works
usually ranging in value from $100,000 to $300,000. Priceless works
such as the Vermeer taken from the Gardner Museum are simply too
famous to be sold anywhere.
   ``It's incredibly stupid to steal a Vermeer or a Rembrandt,''
said Steven Keller, a private security consultant who was brought
in as security director at The Art Institute of Chicago after a
major theft of three works there by Cezanne in 1979.
   ``He (the Gardner thief) has got some things that are too hot to
handle,'' Keller said.
   Keller said lesser-known works and prints that could be sold
more easily were more valuable to thieves than masterworks that
couldn't be fenced.
   ``You might be able to sell say, a lesser-known American
artist's painting in Europe,'' Keller said. ``It's harder to spot
them.''
   Often, thieves who can't sell stolen art underground hold it
ransom for insurance money, a scenario several investigators and
curators said was likely in the Gardner theft.
   Last year, for instance, thieves stole three paintings by van
Gogh, demanded a $2.2 million ransom and returned one of the works.
The others were later recovered and four people suspected of the
theft were arrested.
   ``It happens, and it happens frequently,'' Holmes said. ``But
like any hostage situation, it's got to be outside the public eye,
so often these cases go unnoticed.''
   Keller, noting the relative worth of the art stolen from the
Gardner Museum, said, ``If I were the thief of the Gardner
paintings, I'd ship the Vermeer and the Rembrandt back to the
museum and go for a ransom on the smaller works.''

   Miniature ultrasound probes inserted into the
body are taking the first 3-D pictures of the heart's arteries,
providing highly detailed images of clogged and damaged vessels to
help doctors fix them, researchers report.
   The developers of the technique will present preliminary results
of their tests to a meeting of the American Academy of Cardiology
on Tuesday.
   ``This is potentially an extremely powerful tool,'' said one of
the researchers, Dr. Kenneth Rosenfield of St. Elizabeth's Hospital
in Boston.
   The pictures clearly show cracks and breaks in the artery wall,
bulges of fatty deposits and the layers of tissue that surround the
blood vessel.
   The development of three-dimensional images appears to be a
significant improvement on the still-experimental use of
inside-the-body ultrasound probes to take pictures of ailing
arteries.
   That technique, which is only about 2 years old, has been used
to make two-dimensional pictures of cross sections of blood
vessels. Even with its limitations, doctors often describe this
approach as ``a fantastic voyage'' for its ability to give the
illusion that they are traveling inside of blood vessels.
   The two-dimensional images are simple slices of the artery that
resemble pictures of donuts. The -D pictures have depth of field.
On a TV screen, doctors can look down the artery, examine the
muscle that surrounds it or even open it up and explore the rough,
snaking surface that blood flows over.
   The pictures can be rotated side to side or end to end to give
doctors the best perspective on the contours they need to smooth
away or work around.
   With this extra information, the Boston doctors believe that
cardiologists will be able to do a better job diagnosing the
specific irregularities that interfere with blood flow so they can
repair circulation to the heart and other parts of the body.
   ``It will enable us, we hope, to get better results and
ultimately make patients suffer less,'' said Rosenfield. ``We want
to make successful procedures out of ones that once would have been
failures.''
   The system was created by computer software developers at
ImageComm Systems in Santa Clara, Calif., in consultation with the
St. Elizabeth's doctors.
   When the arteries that feed the heart become clogged, the
reduced flow of blood causes chest pain known as angina. Doctors
routinely treat this condition with angioplasty. In this technique,
a miniature balloon is blown up and then deflated inside the artery
to push away the deposits. The arteries, however, often clog again
within a few months, and doctors are working on even more
aggressive cleaning techniques that they hope will keep blood
flowing for years.
   These procedures involve using lasers to burn away the deposits
or whirling knives to scrape them off. Specialists say the 3-D
pictures may be especially useful for guiding these new tools,
because they will enable doctors to judge how deeply they can cut
and burn without breaking through the artery walls.
   To make the image, the doctor first inserts a thin tube through
the circulatory system into the heart's arteries. The tube is
tipped with ultrasound-producing crystals. As the doctor slowly
pulls the crystals through the artery, they snap five ultrasound
pictures per second.
   Then, a computer stacks the cross-section pictures on top of
each other like the slices in a loaf of bread. The computer makes
assumptions about what lies in the spaces between each slice. The
result is a continuous picture of the artery.
   Currently, the pictures must be processed on ImageComm's
computers in California. But the developers predict that within a
few months, doctors should be able to have live 3-D pictures as
they work on patients in their hospitals.
   Terry Laas, ImageComm's sales director, said his company created
the 3-D process at the request of Dr. Jeffrey M. Isner and other
heart specialists at St. Elizabeth's.
   ``They are the brains behind this whole process,'' said Laas.
``They knew want they wanted to accomplish and just asked the right
questions.''

   A package bomb left in front of an
apartment exploded when it was picked up Monday night, killing a
70-year-old man, police said.
   The man was reportedly returning to his apartment with his wife
and daughter when the incident occurred at about 8 p.m. The blast
was powerful enough to destroy the roof overhand of the two-story
apartment building, police said.
   At first, the family stepped over the package and went inside
their first-floor apartment, authorities said.
   ``He came back (out), picked it up and it exploded,'' said
police spokesman Steve Weintraub.
   The victim, identified as Sherwin Finley, was airlifted to
University Hospital, where he was pronounced dead a short while
later. His wife, Dorothy, 67, and 35-year-old daughter were not
injured.
   According to witnesses, the package resembled a shoebox and was
wrapped in brown paper. It was not sent through the mail.
   ``He opened it and when he did, two tremendous explosions
happened at the same time,'' said witness Ken Ames. ``It just blew
him jumping backwards and all the debris started to fall.''
   Weintraub said Finley had worked for the department of road
engineering in Missouri and moved with his family into the
apartment complex on Dec. 1. Neighbors knew little about them.
   ``I don't know if they're down here to see if they wanted to
live here or what,'' Weintraub said.
   Police had no suspects or motive for the bombing. The FBI was
investigating but had no comment late Monday.

<TEXT>
   An agreement to end a five-day,
anti-abortion filibuster in the state Senate apparently unraveled
Monday as both sides held firm in the debate over an
abortion-rights bill.
   The agreement had been announced late Sunday by Senate President
Thomas V. Mike Miller. The Democrat had said it was acceptable to
32 senators, enough to pass a motion of cloture that would end the
filibuster, which began Thursday.
   Both sides, however, said the agreement was based on a
misunderstanding over a compromise proposed by an anti-abortion
legislator. The misunderstanding became apparent only when
negotiators attempted to put the finishing touches to it.
   Negotiating teams meet several times Monday morning, but the
talks were suspended in the afternoon when both sides refused to
budge from their positions. The anti-abortion senators insisted
they were prepared to carry on the debate indefinitely.
   ``We proposed a very reasonable compromise,'' said Democratic
Sen. Thomas P. O'Reilly, a staunch abortion opponent. ``We feel
very strongly about it.''
   Democratic Sen. Barbara A. Hoffman, a leading abortion rights
senator, said her forces were not about to give in, either.
   ``We're just getting more determined,'' she said. ``The other
side offered something that wasn't a compromise.''
   Anti-abortion forces thought they had obtained an agreement in
principle from the pro-choice side to an unusual proposal by
O'Reilly that would have put the abortion issue on a referendum in
November.
   O'Reilly suggested that the General Assembly pass a measure that
would effectively include two bills: a pro-choice measure that
would go into effect immediately and a second, more restrictive
section favored by anti-abortion senators.
   Underlying that proposal was the assumption that any bill
approved and signed into law would immediately be challenged and
wind up in a referendum.
   Under the proposal, if the voters rejected the first section,
the second _ the restrictive one _ automatically would become law.
   Abortion rights legislators said Monday they hadn't gone along
with the two-tier bill, but that the other side had mistakenly
thought they had. They acknowledged, however, the suggestion was
being considered in Monday's talks.
   ``It's a two-tier system or nothing,'' O'Reilly said. ``The
citizens of Maryland deserve a choice.''
   ``I have no problem with the approach _ as long as I can write
section one. ... I also want to write section two,'' said
Democratic Sen. Walter M. Baker, who is leading the pro-choice
negotiating team.
   Baker said the two sides have been unable to agree on how
abortions would be regulated in each of the two sections.
   The original bill was drafted in expectation that the U.S.
Supreme Court will overturn the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision
legalizing abortions.
   The bill would allow unrestricted abortions until a fetus is
able to survive outside the womb. After fetal viability is reached,
abortions would be allowed only to save a woman's life or protect
her health.
   Negotiators said the post-viability question was another serious
obstacle to an agreement.
   Abortion rights activists want a law that would allow such
abortions to protect a woman's mental health, as well as to save
her life or protect her physical health.
   Anti-abortionists would like to restrict post-viability
abortions to those necessary to save the life of the mother, or at
the most to protect her physical health.

<HEAD>House Members and Aides Toured the World in Late 1989</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of every five House members traveled
abroad during the last three months of 1989, visiting at least 60
locations at a cost to taxpayers of about $1 million.
   Recently released records show that 87 members, including two
non-voting delegates, traveled abroad between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31,
1989. Well over 100 staff members also went overseas.
   The delegations went to some of the finest cities in Europe, to
the Third World, and in the case of two House Appropriations
Committee staffers, to Antarctica to study research projects.
   Staffers who travel with members said the workload on a trip can
vary with the delegation leader.
   The staff of Rep. Stephen J. Solarz' House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee works on a rotation schedule because their boss wears
them out.
   ``We have a working breakfast at 7:30 a.m., three meetings
before lunch, a working lunch, two or three meetings in the
afternoon, cocktails with one group and a working dinner with
another,'' said Stanley Roth, staff director of the New York
Democrat's subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs. ``That's a
pretty basic day.''
   However, one House staff member said staffers refer to some
lawmakers as ``WCS'' or ``world class shoppers.''
   This source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, recalled a
member once asking, ``Why the hell did you allow the meeting to go
after 6 o'clock? The stores are closed.''
   The House records show the cost of the trips was at least
$971,000 from October through December, but reports still not filed
could push the total to more than $1 million.
   Many members flew in first-class commercial seats, while larger
delegations used military jets, maintained at Andrews Air Force
Base in suburban Maryland for federal executives and members of
Congress.
   One far-ranging trip last November and December took a House
Armed Services Committee delegation to Morocco, Egypt, Jordan,
Oman, Bahrain and Portugal in 11 days.
   The delegation met a king, a sultan and a president. They ate
pigeon, saw the pyramids and cruised the Nile. But these pleasures
were mingled with hours of embassy briefings, meetings with foreign
officials and banquets.
   By the end of the trip, members and staffers ``were saying it
was like the Bataan death march,'' said Rep. Patricia Schroeder,
D-Colo., who organized the trip as chairman of the Armed Services
subcommittee on military installations.
   Schroeder said 18-hour days were the norm on her trip, adding
there were ``no golf clubs ... no tanning clinics. The food was
very good, but I don't think we ever sat down to a dinner that was
less than three hours long.''
   Although Schroeder freely discussed the perks along with the
workload of her trip, lawmakers generally react defensively about
travel.
   Rep. Mervin Dymally, D-Calif., who took three trips from October
to December that landed him in Africa, Europe, South America and
Asia, responded to an inquiry about his travel by preparing a
report on his mission.
   Dymally, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on
international operations, said he was studying ``diplomatic
security, anti-terrorism, construction of new buildings,
acquisition of sites, and the controversy surrounding the Moscow
Embassy,'' which was never occupied by U.S. diplomats because it
was found to be filled with listening devices.
   Some members were frequent fliers during the last three months
of 1989.
   Rep. Eni F. H. Faleomavaega, the Democratic non-voting delegate
from American Samoa, went to New Zealand in November to discuss
fishing issues. He traveled to Jamaica in November to discuss
Caribbean economic matters. Then it was on to Panama, Nicaragua and
El Salvador in October to assess current events in those countries.
   Dymally went to The Gambia, the United Kingdom and France in one
October trip, and two weeks later traveled to Venezuela, Suriname,
Curacao, Haiti and Guyana. He also went in December to Japan, South
Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong.
   Not all members' experiences are pleasant.
   Schroeder said her delegation complained to Moroccan officials
about that country's cancellation of a military exercise with the
United States and the postponement of parliamentary elections.
   The delegation, which included Reps. William L. Dickinson,
R-Ala., Andy Ireland, R-Fla., and Solomon P. Ortiz, D-Texas, felt
like ``the skunks at the garden party,'' Schroeder said.

<HEAD>Drug-Using Teens Three Times More Likely to Attempt Suicide, Study
Finds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teenager taking drugs is three times more
likely to attempt suicide than non-drug users, suggesting that
marijuana, alcohol and other drugs play a powerful role in suicide
among the young, according to a new study.
   ``There's no question that the drugs themselves can lead to
depressive effects that lead to suicide attempts,'' said Dr.
Richard H. Schwartz, a Vienna, Va., pediatrician who co-authored
the study. ``Among the youth, the more easily obtainable is the
drug, the greater the adverse effects. Suicide attempts increase
dramatically.''
   The study, by Schwartz and by Alan L. Berman, a member of the
psychology department faculty at American University, is published
this month in the American Journal of Diseases of Children.
   Suicide is the third leading cause of death among Americans aged
15 to 24, and in Virginia, where Schwartz practices, suicide is the
second leading cause of death among this age group.
   Schwartz said his study involved testing and questioning of 298
adolescent patients in four treatment centers he identified as
being in three separate areas east of the Mississippi River.
Two-thirds of those surveyed admitted they had thoughts about
committing suicide, and 89, or 30 percent, said they had made
actual suicide attempts.
   Earlier studies, said Schwartz, shows that only 6 percent to 7
percent of the general adolescent population attempts suicide.
   Schwartz said the patients in his study were between 13 and 19
years of age. Ninety-three percent were white, and 66 percent were
male.
   The most popular drug among the group was marijuana, with
alcohol a distant second. But other drugs, such as crack, cocaine,
angel dust and LSD, also were used.
   Among those who attempted suicide, 40 percent said they made the
attempt within eight hours after using drugs.
   Schwartz said though there probably are ``multiple factors''
that lead to suicide attempts, he believes the higher number of
attempts among drug users may be attributed to the depressive
effects of some drugs, or to the ``low'' that develops after using
drugs such as cocaine or crack.
   ``Some drugs, in and of themselves, have depressive effects.
Alcohol does, and so does PCP (angel dust) and LSD,'' said
Schwartz. For drugs that are stimulants, such as crack or cocaine,
``the depression is a rebound. They go up very high, and the higher
the high, the lower the low.''
   Most of the suicide attempts were ``of low lethality,'' said
Schwartz, with 61 percent requiring no medical attention. But 10
percent tried to kill themselves at the wheel of a car and 8
percent tried to hang themselves.
   ``About 15 percent (of those who attempted suicide) spent time
in intensive care,'' said Schwartz. ``These were not superficial
wrist slashings'' but serious attempts that could have resulted in
death without prompt medical care.
   Schwartz said he and Berman were ``astounded'' to learn that 23
percent of those who tried to kill themselves said their families
still kept firearms and ammunition around the home after the
suicide attempt.
   ``You cannot keep weapons at home like that if there is an
adolescent on drugs. You can assume a one in nine chance of
multiple suicide attempts, so you need to get rid of firearms,''
said Schwartz. ``Among successful suicides, there's a growing
tendency to use firearms.''

   Faye Dunaway says her memorable portrayal of
Joan Crawford in the 1981 film ``Mommie Dearest'' was one of the
big mistakes of her career.
   ``I shouldn't have done the Crawford role,'' Dunaway said in the
April issue of Fame. ``My actor friends feel it was a real
performance. But in fact, it was carried too far and it got too
camp.''
   Her latest role is that of the wealthy but sterile wife of a
military leader in ``The Handmaid's Tale.''
   She recently moved to Los Angeles from New York with her
9-year-old son and plans to begin producing her own projects for
film and television.
   ``When older men star in movies, they have love affairs with
much younger women,'' said the 49-year-old actress. ``Look at Paul
Newman in his movies. I don't think it's fair.
   ``It's in the eyes of the people who are making the movies, and
it's in society, too, which equates desirability with youth. The
only answer is to produce the movies yourself, believe in the
roles, and fight for them.''

   Jane Pauley's popularity has soared since her
departure from the ``Today'' show, and that has her worried.
   ``Most TV stars are larger than life,'' she said in the March 26
issue of Newsweek. ``But my guess is that viewers identify with me
rather than stand back and admire. So you don't want to pump me up
to be a great big star because then you've changed me. This could
be tricky.''
   Pauley will be substituting for ``NBC Nightly News'' anchor Tom
Brokaw for three weeks this spring when he goes on vacation and NBC
has scheduled five specials for her this summer as a dry run for a
prime-time series.

   Clayton Moore says playing the Lone Ranger
on the long-running television series fulfilled a childhood dream.
   ``When I was a kid, I wanted to be a policeman or a cowboy and I
got the white hat,'' Moore said Saturday night as he was inducted
into the National Cowboy Hall of Fame's Hall of Great Western
Performers.
   ``I will always wear it because I believe in the good guys.''
   Moore also paid tribute to the late Jay Silverheels, who played
Tonto on ``Lone Ranger.''
   ``I had help along the way. Tonto was always there. I wish here
he was here with me tonight,'' Moore said.
   Also inducted into the hall was actor James Garner, who played
the lead role in the television program ``Maverick,'' and was in
the movie ``Support Your Local Sheriff,'' among other western films.
   ``I always tried to portray cowboys as I saw them ... as
honorable men,'' Garner said. ``My heroes always have been cowboys
and they still are today.''

   Former Mayor Edward I. Koch takes on old foes
with his customary vitriol in a collection of letters and newspaper
columns from his 12-year reign.
   ``Always give as good as you get,'' Koch wrote his successor,
David Dinkins, who defeated him last year. That letter is one of
several in ``All the Best: Letters from a Feisty Mayor,'' due out
in April.
   On the scandals that shook his third term, Koch wrote to
Dinkins, ``The most searing pain of my twelve years was learning I
had been betrayed by people who were corrupt.
   ``I was despondent. I must confess, on several occasions when I
was alone, I wept. It was hard to get myself out of bed in the

<HEAD>Reagan Still a Big Draw on Campaign Trail</HEAD>

   Less than a year and a half after proclaiming
himself ``at the end of a long political journey,'' Ronald Reagan
is back on the campaign trail.
   The former Republican president is putting his popularity to
work for GOP candidates running for Congress and state
legislatures, as some ex-presidents have done before him.
   Already, Reagan has helped with fund raising for state GOP
organizations in Georgia and Washington, for Senate candidates in
Indiana and Iowa and for Sen. Pete Wilson's gubernatorial bid in
California.
   And although he normally commands speaking fees of $30,000 or
more, Reagan accepts no pay for his party appearances, spokesman
Mark Weinberg said.
   Reagan, campaigning on Nov. 5, 1988, for George Bush, told a
national radio audience, ``We're now at the end of a long political
journey that marks for me the end of my last campaign as an
officeholder.''
   Still, Reagan ``intends to be out there'' for fellow Republicans
this year, Weinberg said.
   GOP leaders are delighted to have the ex-president's help.
   When the Georgia Republican Party announced that Reagan would
speak at its annual Presidents' Day lunch in Atlanta on Feb. 10,
``the response was just phenomenal,'' said Bill Thorn, the party's
executive director. ``It was not a hard sell at all.''
   Nearly 2,000 people turned out, bringing in more than $200,000.
   A few weeks later, Reagan traveled a few blocks from his Los
Angeles office to speak at a private fund-raising lunch for Iowa
GOP Senate candidate Rep. Thomas J. Tauke. The lunch attracted
about 45 people who each contributed $500 or, in some cases, $1,000.
   Combining politics with a paycheck, Reagan pulled in about
$40,000 for Washington Republicans in December by making brief
remarks and posing for photographs at a private reception while he
was in Seattle to deliver a paid speech to business executives.
   For Wilson, the former president spoke at fund-raisers in the
Los Angeles area and in San Diego. Reagan also lent his signature
to a fund-raising letter for Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana several
months ago.
   ``Right now we are helping coordinate a political plan which is
geared toward all of the various things that he can do to be
helpful, particularly in the target races,'' said Leslie Goodman,
spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee.
   Former President Richard Nixon, an increasing presence on the
political scene, ``has agreed to work with us as well,'' Ms.
Goodman said.
   Nixon, who resigned in 1974 under threat of impeachment because
of the Watergate scandal, made a handful of campaign appearances
over the last decade and has received a number of requests for
appearances this year, according to his assistant, John Taylor.
   Sitting out the 1990 campaign will be former President and House
GOP Leader Gerald Ford, but not by choice, said his spokesman, Bob
Barrett. Ford has a knee operation scheduled for this fall.
   The only surviving Democratic president, Jimmy Carter, is not
expected to take part in the 1990 campaign.
   ``His work is here at the Carter Center and is generally pretty
apolitical,'' said Carrie Harmon, a spokeswoman for Carter in
Atlanta.
   ``He has certainly played a different role than Reagan has or
than Ford has since he left office,'' said Anita Dunn,
communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee. ``He has done some fund-raising for Democrats, but he
has not been a really prominent campaigner.''
   In years past, former President Harry S. Truman campaigned for
Democratic candidates from 1952, when he left office, until he was
disabled by a stroke in 1966, according to archivist Dennis S.
Bilger of the Truman Library in Independence, Mo.
   The last Republican president before Reagan to serve eight
years, Dwight Eisenhower, ``never went out on the circuit'' after
completing his two terms in 1960, according to Eisenhower
biographer Stephen Ambrose.
   ``He would speak on closed-circuit TV to dinners. He would
attend some fund-raising dinners, but I can't think ever for a
specific candidate,'' Ambrose said.

   Robert Caro can understand why some Lyndon
Johnson supporters are unhappy with with the second of a
four-volume series on the former president's life.
   Caro also felt disappointed. ``I really thought I was going to
love him,'' said Caro, author of ``The Years of Lyndon Johnson:
Means of Ascent.''
   ``When I started on the series, I thought he was like (former
New York Gov.) Al Smith. There were great similarities. They were
both very uneducated, physically unattractive,'' said Caro, who
wrote of Smith in the Pulitzer Prize-winning ``The Power Broker:
Robert Moses and the Fall of New York.''
   ``But Al Smith, while he was a ruthless politician, I thought
Smith's motivating drive underneath was his desire to help his
people, like the Irish immigrants,'' said Caro, who has spent 14
years studying Johnson's life. ``I had the same image of Lyndon
Johnson when I started and it was an image that died hard.''
   What Caro claims to have discovered was that Johnson was a
self-centered politician obsessed with power, willing to do
anything _ steal a U.S. Senate election, wildly exaggerate his war
record, even risk his life _ to advance himself.
   Caro's first volume, ``The Years of Lyndon Johnson: The Path to
Power,'' was published in 1982 and also riled some Johnson
supporters.
   Former Johnson aide Jack Valenti has accused Caro of being
``passionately bent on destroying'' the late president's
reputation. Bob Hardesty, a Johnson speechwriter who helped him
write his memoirs, called Caro's biography dishonest.
   ``I don't think it pretends to be fair. I think it is the work
of a man with a burning, unnatural hatred for his subject,''
Hardesty said.
   Caro denied bias. He said his assertions are supported by books,
newspapers, court documents, files obtained from the Johnson
Library and by interviews with Johnson's widow, Lady Bird, and
others.
   ``Means of Ascent,'' published by Alfred A. Knopf, begins with
Johnson's narrow defeat for the U.S. Senate in 1941 and ends in
1948 when Johnson beat former Texas Gov. Coke Stevenson by 87 votes
in a Senate race long suspected of having been stolen.
   Caro said that ballot boxes were stuffed and votes altered.
   ``I really believe that no fair-minded person can ever doubt
again that the election was stolen,'' Caro insisted, ``and not with
87 votes or 200 votes, but with thousands of votes. It was not
simply something that everybody did, this went further.
   ``The amazing thing to me is that there was doubt for so many
years. When you start reading the court transcripts, witness after
witness testifies the same way.''
   Caro also said that Johnson portrayed himself as ``a war-scarred
veteran of many battles on many fronts,'' but actually saw combat
in the South Pacific only as an observer and ``for a total of 13
minutes.''
   He wrote of a man who frequently humiliated Lady Bird, had a
lengthy affair with a publisher's wife and campaigned despite
potentially life-threatening kidney stones that caused fever and
excruciating pain.
   Caro agreed with his critics that his subject comes across
unfavorably, but said he felt compassion for him, referring to
Johnson's painful experiences growing up when his family was in
poverty.
   ``I tell you there are times when you really do feel like
crying,'' Caro said.
   Caro said more positive qualities that Johnson displayed as a
senator and then as president will be depicted in upcoming volumes.
   ``A Johnson person might say, `What is this? Where is the rest
of Lyndon Johnson?' The third volume, when he's passing civil
rights legislation, takes hundreds of pages and you really see him
doing something noble.
   ``He had those elements in him, great gifts. An empathy for
really the disadvantaged in society and a matchless gift for
mobilizing the powers of government.''

<HEAD>Spring Arrives Soon by the Calendar; Weathermen Say It's Already

   Meteorologists have been enjoying spring for a
few weeks now, while calendar-watchers are only now about to catch
up with them.
   ``The first day of spring is one thing and the first spring day
is another. The difference between them is sometimes as great as a
month,'' observed the late Henry Van Dyke of Princeton University.
   Calendars proclaim March 20 as the ``first day of spring.'' But
to weather and climate professionals, spring arrived on March 1.
   Who's right?
   ``There has always been a division of opinion as to where to
place the boundaries and the middles of the four seasons,'' reports
Guy Ottewell in The Astronomical Companion.
   In one system the equinoxes and solstices that mark the movement
of the sun are considered seasonal boundaries, while other systems
consider those dates to be seasonal midpoints, he says.
   And while the federal government has managed to regulate most
aspects of life in one way or another, even putting three different
federal agencies in charge of time, there is no ``bureau of the
seasons.''
   Climatologists simply divide the year into four three-month
seasons, with spring arriving each March 1.
   The popular perception of spring beginning on March 20 is based
on the decision reached about a century ago by calendar printers to
mark the seasons with the dates of the solstices and equinoxes.
   In those days calendar makers usually printed almanacs too, and
those featured the movement of the sun, moon and stars. That made
it convenient to designate spring as beginning with a special date
_ the vernal equinox.
   That's the date when daylight and darkness are nearly equal as
the sun crosses the equator on its apparent trip north. It occurs
on Tuesday afternoon this year.
   That system of dividing the seasons apparently originated about
70 B.C. with the astronomer Geminus of Rhodes.
   Spring, by the calendar method, lasts until the summer solstice
_ the northernmost point reached by the sun _ which comes June 21
this year.
   That day, the first day of summer for many Americans, is known
as midsummer in much of Europe and great bonfires and celebrations
are held on Midsummer's Night.
   Richard Inwards, a leader of England's Royal Meteorological
Society late in the last century, said the use of the solstices and
equinoxes to mark seasons was illogical.
   More reasonable, he believed, was the system used in the Middle
Ages in Europe, using saints' days to mark the seasons. Spring, by
that reckoning, begins on St. Peter's Day, Feb. 21, and lasts until
May 24.
   The medieval reckoning of summer lasting from May 25 to Aug. 23
helps explain why June 21, the first day of summer on American
calendars, is known as Midsummer's Day in Europe.
   Using the equinoxes and solstices as midpoints of seasons means
the seasons begin on what are known as the cross-quarter days,
between the solstices and equinoxes, Ottewell reports.
   By that reckoning spring began on Groundhog Day, Feb. 2, and is
now about half over.
   Many astronomers consider spring the first season and in ancient
times it marked the new year rather than having that celebration in
midwinter as is done now.
   For the record, the three federal agencies keeping track of time
are the U.S. Naval Observatory, which operates atomic clocks; the
National Institute of Standards and Technology, which defines the
exact length of units of time; and the Department of
Transportation, which is in charge of the changes from standard to
daylight time and back again. That next occurs on April 1.

<TEXT>
   Efforts to ban semiautomatic assault weapons,
speed up appeals in death penalty cases and permit searches without
warrants are generating new heat in the Senate as lawmakers brace
for an election-year anti-crime debate.
   ``We cannot win the drug fight without tough criminal laws,''
Sen Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said of the legislation, which the Senate
is expected to tackle soon now that members are returning from last
week's recess.
   The bill began in the Senate as an anti-crime package
recommended by President Bush.
   Majority Democrats, however, made major changes, and the
administration opposes the bill being brought to the floor by
Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del.
   But Republicans still hope it can be retailored to suit White
House tastes.
   Divisions are so deep that few, if any, senators would be
shocked to see the bill filibustered to death. Conservatives wince
at the notion of adding more gun-control legislation, while Senate
liberals have little stomach for expanding use of the death penalty.
   ``No matter how brutal the crime a person has committed, the
infliction of death at the hands of government brutalizes our
society,'' says Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. ``The death penalty
is a dead end in the war on crime.''
   Both Biden's bill and a GOP rival sponsored by Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., would reinstate the death penalty for 30 federal
crimes, including assassination of the president. Such a law has
been on the books for decades, but Supreme Court decisions in the
1970s blocked courts from imposing death in those cases.
   Both bills also would set deadlines for death row inmates to
file federal appeals or forfeit their right to do so. The idea is
to prevent delays that sometimes drag out for a decade.
   ``The result is a criminal justice system which is overburdened
with piecemeal and repetitious litigation and years of delay
between sentencing and a final judicial resolution of the criminal
matter,'' Thurmond says.
   But critics say defendants should have the maximum chance to
avoid being sent to the execution chamber, contending the death
sentence is sometimes applied in a haphazard or discriminatory
manner.
   The Democratic proposal would allow a second round of appeals
for any prisoner victimized by a ``miscarriage of justice'' on his
first try.
   Kennedy also wants to allow those awaiting execution to argue
that capital punishment was imposed on them as part of a
statistical pattern of bias against minorities.
   But Hatch contends the provision ``is transparently designed to
abolish the death penalty in all cases'' and that would kill the
crime bill ``without a doubt.''
   Meanwhile, Republicans want to allow courts, in some cases, to
admit evidence obtained in searches carried out without warrants if
police acted ``in good faith.''
   The Democratic bill primarily echoes the latest Supreme Court
ruling on this ``exclusionary rule,'' which allows courts in some
circumstances to admit evidence obtained in a flawed manner _ but
not without a warrant.
   Democrats also want to widen the opportunity for defendants to
get evidence thrown out of court.
   Manufacture, sale and possession of nine types of semiautomatic
assault weapons would be banned under the Biden bill. The American
Rifle Association has been lobbying against the provision, and
there is speculation that it would lead to a filibuster unless
dropped.
   Republicans propose to ban domestic assembly of foreign-made
assault weapons already barred from import into the United States
and outlaw clips of more than 15 bullets.
   Biden's bill also would create an independent organized crime

effectively overturn a decision by Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
that gave local U.S. attorneys control over the department's
vaunted organized crime strike forces.

<HEAD>East Germans in First Free Elections Show Prosperity No. 1 Goal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   For East German voters, it's not just
unification that lies over the rainbow. It's Western prosperity as
well.
   That was the main message from Sunday's historic free elections,
which gave the conservatives a huge and unexpected win.
   Born in church basements where young activists once met to hide
from the despised secret police, the peaceful revolution that
ousted hard-line Communist rulers five months ago quickly lost its
innocence and idealism.
   After unleashing tens of thousands of people on the streets, the
New Forum opposition movement found that the thirst for riches soon
drowned out calls to reform socialism for the good of the people.
   East Germans, many with tears in their eyes, asked over and over
again ``what have we been doing for 40 years?'' as they gazed in
wonder at the glittering shops of West Berlin after the Berlin Wall
crumbled in November.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, spotting the most basic
of all election issues, furiously campaigned throughout East
Germany with a message of ``prosperity for all.''
   Many recalled that that was also a favorite slogan of Chancellor
Ludwig Erhard, the late West German leader who guided the post-war
``economic miracle.''
   Sunday's conservative win, engineered in large part by Kohl,
shows that East Germans believe in a second economic miracle.
   ``The East Germans have voted for the West German mark and for
unification,'' commented West Germany's ARD television network.
``It was important for them that Kohl was the one with the keys to
the cash box.''
   And that, said ARD, set the Christian Democratic chancellor
apart from West Germany's opposition Social Democrats, who often
lectured East German voters on the need to slow down the pace of
unification and curb their expectations.
   While Poles, Hungarians and Czechoslovaks now enjoy
once-unthinkable democracy, it will take them years, if not
decades, to reform their economies. The governments will have to
attract and compete for Western investment at the same time they
learn to cope with multiparty systems.
   For East Germans, the road to recovery seems much closer.
   ``The decisive thought for East Germans may have been, `If we
vote for Kohl, the money will flow,''' said Oskar Lafontaine, the
Social Democrat governor of West Germany's Saarland state who will
try to unseat Kohl in December elections.
   In fact, East German leftists had joined the Communists several
times in recent weeks in virtually begging Kohl for billions of
dollars in bailout money to save the ravaged economy.
   Each time, Kohl's heavily publicized answer was ``no'' _ not
until the East German voters show they want true economic reform.
   Even so, it's a long way from voting in the conservatives to
accepting the bitter pills Kohl's economic advisers and West German
investors are likely to be handing out.
   East Germans, some still covered with grease and dressed in
overalls, had been seizing the microphones at dozens of panel
discussions to denounce any reforms that would cost their jobs.
   But last week's announcement that West German-led economic
reforms will cost 100,000 jobs in the East German automobile
industry and related sectors is believed to be just the tip of the
iceberg.
   Another potentially destabilizing factor is the continuing
hemorrhage of East Germans relocating to West Germany, many of them
trying to take a shortcut to prosperity.
   ``I don't think the results themselves will stop the
emigration,'' conceded East German Christian Democratic leader
Lothar de Maiziere, the top contender for the premier's post.
``Rather, it's a question of measures that now must be taken.''
   With the number of emigrants heading West at up to 2,500 a day,
those measures will have to be fast and convincing.
   Kohl himself used his first post-election statements to plead
with East Germans to stay put and help build up their ``beautiful
country.''
   There was no mention of the country's decaying homes nor of its
pollution-choked rivers and air.
   Left behind with only a few crumbs thrown by loyal voters were
New Forum and other leftist groups that had preached the need for
East Germans to maintain their own identity and forge a ``new
path'' between capitalism and socialism.
   ``It's not the first time that a people has forgotten its own
martyrs,'' commented ARD television, noting that many of the
pioneers of the pro-democracy movement had spent years in jail
working for their cause.
   Said Stephan Bickhardt of the leftist Democracy Now party: ``The
revolution has cast off its children.''
   Democracy Now, New Forum and another leftist group had joined
together in a much publicized coalition that failed to get even 3
percent of the votes.
   Other East Germans also see the end of another failed experiment
in socialism.
   ``It's just proof that people really are just looking for riches
and a trip to Tenerife,'' complained government worker Elke Heise,
naming the Canary Island that's a favorite vacation spot for hordes
of sun-hungry West Germans each year.
   Added East Berlin engineer Fred Mauer: ``The Christian Democrats
can now do with us whatever they want.''
   And that's likely to include even more shots called by a West
German chancellor eager to see his name go down in history books as
the man who united a people torn asunder by the crimes and madness
of Adolf Hitler.

   Here is a list of some major art thefts since 1982:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MARCH 18, 1990 _ Two robbers dressed as police officers steal 11
paintings and an ancient Chinese beaker from the Isabella Stewart
Gardner Museum in Boston. The stolen paintings included works by
Rembrandt, Degas and Vermeer. The works are said to be worth
hundreds of millions of dollars.
   DEC. 29, 1989 _ Eight works by Matisse reported missing from the
Nice apartment where the French artist had lived. Police recover
the works, with an estimated value of $12.5 million, during a
routine traffic stop Jan. 9.
   NOV. 5, 1989 _ Works worth at least $17 million are taken from
the home of Picasso's daughter, Marina Picasso, including seven
paintings by Picasso, a Brueghel and a bust by August Rodin.
   SEPTEMBER 1989 _ Works worth $3 million, including 81 Andy
Warhol lithographs, are stolen from a gallery near Bonn, West
Germany. Authorities recover the works from a Dutch art dealer.
   AUGUST 1989 _ Two men steal paintings and three signet rings
worth $4 million from a New York art collector. The booty includes
a 1516 painting worth $3 million alone and a ring the owner said
belonged to the family of Vlad the Impaler, the Eastern European
prince who inspired the vampire legend of Count Dracula.
   JUNE 1, 1989 _ A Braque painting worth an estimated $3 million
is taken from the National Museum of Modern Art at Paris' Pompidou
Center.
   MAY 3, 1989 _ Six armed men flashing fake police badges steal
$30 million to $40 million worth of paintings, sculptures and
tapestries from the Chacara do Ceu Museum in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil. Police recover the works, which include paintings by Dali
and Matisse and two Chinese ceramic sculpted horses from the 7th
century T'ang Dynasty.
   APRIL 12, 1989 _ Three armed robbers take 21 Renaissance
paintings worth more than $5 million from a gallery in Zurich,
Switzerland. Police recover at least nine of the works.
   DEC. 12, 1988 _ Thieves steal three paintings by van Gogh, with
an estimated value of $72 million to $90 million, from the
Kroeller-Mueller Museum in a remote section of the Netherlands. The
thieves demand a ransom of $2.2 million for the works, and return
one of them. Police recover the other two on July 13, 1989.
   MAY 20, 1988 _ Three paintings by van Gogh, Cezanne and Dutch
artist Johan Jongkind are tolen from Amsterdam's Stedelijk Museum.
Museum estimates the paintings' worth at $52 million, but
Christie's auction house puts it at $11 million. Authorities later
recover the works in March 1989.
   FEB. 8, 1988 _ Burglars break through a skylight into the
Colnaghi Art Gallery in New York City, and steal 27 Old Master
paintings and drawings. The stolen artwork is valued at $6 million,
including two panels by 15th century Italian Renaissance master Fra
Angelico.
   JAN. 23-24, 1988 _ A thief takes four etchings by French
painters Renoir, Manet, Pissarro, and Millet from a Brazilian
museum and demands a $60,000 ransom for their return.
   MARCH 24, 1987 _ Six paintings are stolen from the Juan B.
Castagnino Municipal Museum in Rosario, Argentina. Among the
paintings, worth an estimated $12 million, are works by Goya, El
Greco, Tiziano and Veronese.
   MAY 21, 1986 _ Vermeer's ``Lady Writing a Letter with her
Maid,'' is among 18 paintings worth $40 million stolen from
Russborough House in Blessington, Ireland. Others stolen include
works by Goya, Rubens, and Gainsborough. The thieves escape with 18
paintings, but dump seven of the least valuable works near a
reservoir. Some of the same paintings were stolen in 1974 in an
abortive attempt to ransom them for IRA prisoners in Britain and
were recovered eight days after the theft.
   OCT. 27, 1985 _ Five armed men steal nine impressionist
paintings from Paris' Marmottan Museum in a bank-style holdup.
Monet's ``Impression Soleil Levant'' (Impression Sunrise) is taken
along with four other Monets, two Renoirs, a Morisot, and a Naruse.
The museum's curator estimates the paintings' value at $12.5
million but deems the famed Monet priceless because of its historic
value. The Monet has been traced to Japan, but has not been
recovered to date.
   NOVEMBER 1983 _ Seven Italian Renaissance masterpieces,
including works by Raphael and Tintoretto, are stolen from the
Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest, Hungary. All of the paintings,
worth $7 million, are recovered within a year, some from a sack
pulled from the Danube River.
   OCTOBER 1982 _ Eight paintings are stolen from the Norwegian
National Gallery in Oslo. Seven of the works, valued at $5.55
million and including masterpieces by Picasso, Rembrandt and van
Gogh, are recovered two years later in West Germany.

<HEAD>Shift of Power Gives Impoverished Nation A Chance for Democracy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ In a dramatic shift of power last
week from the army to civilians, this impoverished country moved
closer to democracy than it has been since the fall of the 29-year
Duvalier family dictatorship in 1986.
   But Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, the new provisional president, still
faces the possibility of a backlash from diehards in the
ill-disciplined, 6,000-man army, this Caribbean nation's
traditional power broker.
   ``There still are Duvalierist death squads who oppose change,''
said Victor Benoit, co-leader of a political coalition that
spearheaded the fall of the latest military regime. ``They're armed
and we know they're very mad about the shift in power.''
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot also inherits an economy destroyed by
decades of plundering and political turmoil in a land with few
natural resources and not enough food for its 5.1 million people.
   But the flight of military ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril last
week in the face of a popular uprising and the unconditional
submission of the army High Command to a civilian caretaker
government could become a watershed in Haitian history.
   Barring another coup, Haiti could within three to six months
have its first democratically elected government since gaining
independence from France in 1804 after a slave revolt.
   ``We hope this new caretaker government will finally create an
atmosphere for holding free elections, so the people can for once
choose the leaders they want,'' said Louis Roy, main author of the
1987 constitution.
   The last attempt to hold free and fair elections, in November
1987, were thwarted after thugs protected by soldiers killed at
least 34 voters.
   University professor Leslie Manigat was elected as a civilian
president the following January, but the vote was widely regarded
as fraudulent. The army retained effective control and ousted
Manigat in June 1988.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, a 46-year-old Supreme Court judge and
Haiti's first woman president, is to govern along with a 19-member
State Council comprised exclusively of civilians that will have
veto power over her decisions.
   In handing over power at Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot's inauguration
Tuesday, Maj. Gen. Herard Abraham, told her: ``Madame President of
the republic, the armed forces of Haiti are yours to command.''
   It appeared the army's most complete submission to the civilian
political opposition since the generals took control when
Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier fled into exile in France, ending
the tyranny begun by his father, the late Francois ``Papa Doc.''
   ``The ouster of Duvalier was not the end of the dictatorship; it
was prolonged by the military,'' said the Rev. Gilles Danroc, a
French priest and author of ``The Fall of The House of Duvalier.''
   ``What's happening now is what should have happened when
Duvalier left,'' said Communist Party leader Rene Theodore. ``At
that time, the people's revolution was confiscated. They've
recovered it now, for the time being.''
   Avril, former financial adviser to the Duvaliers, took over 18
months ago in a coup led by rank-and-file soldiers demanding
democratic reforms and an end to state-sponsored violence. The coup
ousted the tyrannical Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, who had led two
governments since Duvalier.
   Avril pledged to turn over power to a civilian government in
democratic elections this year and won praise from the U.S.
government for his campaign against drug-trafficking.
   But human rights violations continued, and Avril was beginning
to look more and more like a dictator. In January, his government
brutally cracked down on the opposition, rounding up and beating
scores of critics and expelling seven prominent political leaders.
   In response, Haiti's major political parties announced they
would boycott any election held under Avril's rule, assuming he
would rig the vote.
   On March 5, a soldier shot and killed an 11-year-old girl while
she was studying on her porch in the rural town of Petit Goave.
Although the shooting appeared accidental, it unleashed five days
of nationwide protests.
   Avril resigned on March 10 and fled into exile in the United
States two days later on a U.S. Air Force transport. At least 25
people were killed and scores injured, mostly in clashes between
protesters and the security forces.
   The United States and France, Haiti's two main donors, helped
bring about Avril's ouster and have said financial aid will be
restored under a democratic government. U.S. Ambassador Alvin Adams
said he visited Avril's home on the eve of his departure to
persuade him to leave the country because of continuing civil
unrest.
   The 12-member Unity Assembly, the civic and political coalition
that led the protests against Avril, says the new government's
first priorities will be to organize elections and, to make that
possible, keep a firm grip on the army and disarm marauding gunmen.

<HEAD>Aspin: No Decision on B-2 Funding Until Air Force Turns Over Test
Data</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee says the Air Force has failed to provide Congress with
critical data on the B-2 stealth bomber, making it difficult for
lawmakers to take up the Pentagon's budget request.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., told Air Force Secretary Donald Rice in
a letter released Sunday that his panel some time ago requested the
results of laboratory and scale-model tests of the radar-evading
characteristics of the B-2.
   ``Regrettably, the Air Force has, to date, not submitted this
essential information to appropriately cleared committee staff
members,'' Aspin said in the letter dated March 12.
   It would be ``difficult, if not impossible'' for the committee
to consider the Bush administration's fiscal 1991 budget request
for the stealth bomber, he said.
   President Bush has proposed spending $5.5 billion and procuring
five B-2s in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The administration
hopes to buy 132 planes, considered the most expensive in history,
for a total cost of $70 billion.
   Air Force spokesman Maj. Dick Cole said Friday that Rice spoke
to Aspin on Tuesday, the day after the letter was written, and
pledged the service's full cooperation.

<HEAD>Auto Fuel Efficiency Slipped in Past Two Years, Group Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An environmental group says average fuel
economy for automobiles has declined each of the last two years,
reversing an earlier five-year trend toward more efficient
automobiles.
   The Environmental Action Foundation on Sunday cited statistics
from the Environmental Protection Agency and National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration.
   The average fuel economy of 1990 model cars is expected to be
28.2 miles per gallon, compared with 28.3 mpg for 1989 model cars
and 28.7 mpg for 1988 model cars, according to the government
figures cited by the group.
   An analysis by the EPA attributed the trend to the manufacture
of heavier cars with quicker acceleration times and the use of
larger engines with greater horsepower.
   ``In terms of fuel efficiency we're heading south on a
northbound, one-way street,'' said Robert Dewey of the
Environmental Action Foundation.
   The figures showed that between the 1983 and 1988 model years
the fuel efficiency of both domestic and imported cars increased
steadily from 26.4 mpg to 28.7 mpg.

   Baseball players and owners agreed to a
four-year contract late Sunday night, ending the 32-day lockout and
paving the way for the start of the season on April 9.
   The settlement brought an end to a bitter dispute that kept
players locked out of spring training since Feb. 15, the
second-longest work stoppage in baseball history.
   Commissioner Fay Vincent made the official announcement that an
agreement had been reached at 1:18 a.m. EST Monday.
   ``It's been a difficult process, but on the other hand we
reached an agreement,'' Vincent said.
   Each team will have 158 games scheduled, Deputy Commissioner
Stephen Greenberg said. The season had been scheduled to start on
April 2.
   Greenberg said negotiations were continuing with the union to
work out a full 162-game schedule.
   One of the alternatives being considered is playing the
originally scheduled first week of the season in the week starting
Oct. 1.
   Camps will open on Tuesday and exhibition games will begin on
March 26.
   The agreement was not signed when the news conference started,
but Greenberg said he hoped it would be later Monday.
   American League president Bobby Brown said there might be some
problems with a short spring.
   ``There is obviously concern because of the shortened sprip
training,'' Brown said. ``Obviously we would like it longer. We
realize all of the pitchers and players might not be in as good as
shape as they might be, but we're confident that by April 9 we'll
have a pretty good product.''
   Word spread fast that there was a settlement, and the players
headed for Florida and Arizona.
   ``It's great news. We're all in the same boat and now we'll get
the troops ready,'' Boston manager Joe Morgan said from Winter
Haven, Fla.
   Disappointed fans from kids to President Bush had urged the two
sides to get together.
   The key sticking point had been the point at which individual
players become eligible to take demands for higher pay to
arbitration.
   Owners went into the weekend talks refusing to alter three-year
eligibility and players sought a shorter period.
   According to a source familiar with the agreement, 17 percent of
players between two and three years of major-league service will
become eligible to file for arbitration.

   East Germany's likely new premier, Lothar de
Maiziere, got a taste of a free press after leading a conservative
coalition to victory when hundreds of journalists stormed a
television studio to get a crack at him.
   East German television, inexperienced in covering free
elections, continued to broadcast minor polling tables instead of
turning its cameras on the fracas in which the slight, bespectacled
de Maiziere was violently pushed and shoved.
   ``We have no experience with this kind of stuff. I was
speechless when these people barged in here,'' said anchorman Peter
Guette, 45, who was pummeled by photographers chasing de Maiziere
around the studio table.
   The studio riot was just one of several sideshows Sunday in the
Palace of the Republic, East Germany's glittering Parliament
building, where about 3,000 journalists from as far away as China
and Brazil had set up shop to cover East Germany's first free
elections in its 41-year history.
   The glass-fronted five-story building, once the showpiece of
hard-line Communist rulers, had been turned into a giant television
studio, with about 50 different networks staking out floor space.
   Most major candidates and scores of West German politicians
moved from studio to studio for interviews, thronged by dozens of
photographers, some perched on stepladders.
   Many East Germans at the palace expressed disappointment over
the circus-like atmosphere.
   ``People could have been a little bit more disciplined,'' said
Irene Gruner, staffing an information desk on the sidelines. ``This
is our first free election, and we would have liked to have a
little order.''
   The leaders of the reformed Communist Party boycotted the palace
to protest what they considered the undue influence of West
Germany's two major television stations, which had taken East
German television under their wings and also run the vote
projections.
   De Maiziere, chairman of the Christian Democrats, granted
interviews to the two West German stations, ARD and ZDF, before
speaking before East German cameras.
   Guette and other East German television officials sharply
criticized de Maiziere's behavior, saying it was an example of his
willingness to submit to the West German financial steamroller.
   ``We had an election and now we are being taken over,'' said
Guette.
   De Maiziere, an advocate of a speedy merger with West Germany,
won massive campaign support from West Germany's Christian
Democrats, which are headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   At the Christian Democrats' victory party in a nearby
restaurant, about 2,000 ecstatic supporters chanted ``Helmut,
Helmut'' when the first projections indicated the completely
unexpected results.
   ``I can't believe it,'' said Eberhard Engler, the party's East
Berlin chief, shouted over the noise. Hundreds of supporters
grabbed each other by the shoulders and snaked through the
restaurant in a chain.
   At the cavernous headquarters of the Party of Democratic
Socialism _ the renamed successor of the long-ruling Communist
Party _ the mood was subdued. The party won a little more than 16
percent of the vote and will be relegated to the opposition.
   ``It's terrifying how many people are right-wing,'' said Elke
Heise, a suporter and industry ministry employee. ``We may have to
take to the streets to fight for our rights. I doubt that things
will remain as peaceful as they are now.''

   Here is a chronology of some key events in
German history, starting with World War I:
   June 1914 _ Archduke Ferdinand, heir to the Austrian throne, is
assassinated, triggering World War I. Imperial Germany and Austria
are initially pitted against France, Russia and Britain.
   June 1919 _ Defeated Germany signs the tough Treaty of
Versailles, which awards 13 percent of its pre-war territory to
neighbors, sets wide-ranging reparations and dissolves the Reich's
Prussian-based military command.
   August 1919 _ The new German republic's constitution is adopted
by an assembly in Weimar.
   November 1923 _ Adolf Hitler, whose extreme-right National
Socialist Workers' Party rails against the Versailles treaty, makes
a first grab for national power with the abortive ``beerhall
putsch'' in Munich.
   Jan. 30, 1933 _ Hitler is appointed Reich chancellor amid
political chaos and mass unemployment of the Great Depression. The
Nazis, using slogans mixing populism, assertion of Germany's
identity and anti-Semitism, had become the biggest party in the
Weimar Republic parliament. Hitler ruthlessly consolidates
dictatorial powers within months.
   Sept 1, 1939 _ Hitler's army invades Poland, setting off World
War II.
   May 8, 1945 _ The Third Reich accepts unconditional surrender
after the Allied victory in a war that devastated much of Europe
and killed 55 million people. France, Britain, the United States
and Soviet Union divide Germany and its capital, Berlin, into
occupation zones.
   June 5, 1945 _ The U.S.-Soviet-British Potsdam Agreement awards
eastern German areas mostly to Poland.
   May 23, 1949 _- West Germany, formally know as the Federal
Republic, is founded in the three western occupation zones. Bonn
becomes the capital.
   Oct. 7, 1949 _ The German Democratic Republic (East Germany) is
founded in the Soviet zone. East Berlin is proclaimed the capital.
   June 17, 1953 _ Soviet troops help East Germany's Communist
authorities put down a popular uprising.
   May 5, 1955 _ West Germany enters NATO and becomes sovereign.
   Aug. 13, 1961 _ East Germany builds the Berlin Wall to seal the

   A new, voice-activated ``typewriter'' is a
science-fiction dream-turned-reality that promises to boost
productivity and open a world of opportunity for the handicapped.
   The DragonDictate Voice-Typewriter, which was being formally
unveiled today by Dragon Systems Inc., is billed as the first of
its kind in the world.
   ``My only regret is that your product didn't come out 20 years
ago,'' Frank Whitney, a quadriplegic Maryland computer scientist,
told the company in a letter written on the system. Whitney has
used the system for the past year.
   The ``typewriter,'' which consists of software and a
speech-recognition circuit board for personal computers, allows
users to create memos, manuscripts and other documents by speaking
instead of typing. Users speak into a microphone and see text
appear on a video screen at the rate of 35 words a minute.
   The $9,000 system can recognize 30,000 words and adapt itself to
individual speakers. Until now, voice-activated systems had not
been able to recognize more than 5,000 words.
   The commands are simple. To turn off the system, one says,
``Voice Console: Go to Sleep.'' To turn it on, the command is
``Voice Console: Wake Up.''
   A mistake is corrected by saying ``oops'' and repeating the
correct word. Many functions can be operated manually as well.
   ``The technology can address all segments of the workplace,''
says Janet Baker, who founded the company with her husband, James,
in 1982 after stints in speech-recognition product development at
IBM Corp. and Exxon Corp.
   The system is designed for professionals who don't type well or
who want to write reports and letters that otherwise would be
dictated to a secretary, then transcribed.
   ``The only people who are really good typists are journalists,
computer programmers and secretaries,'' said Baker. ``Doctors,
lawyers and a lot of other people often just hunt and peck or they
rely on handing notes to someone to type up.''
   DragonDictate is also seen as a great boon to the disabled.
Whitney and others with disabilities have used the system in test
marketing around the country for the past year.
   Laura Harris, a 19-year-old sophomore at Harvard University, was
born without fingers on her left hand. She taught herself to type
with her right hand, but did so much typing as a freshman
government major, she injured her hand. She was forced to dictate
her papers into a tape recorder and give it to another student to
transcribe.
   Since January, Harris has used DragonDictate.
   ``It was so hard to dictate before because I couldn't actually
see what I was writing, so I couldn't edit. I often ended up trying
to write longhand and that was painful,'' said Harris.
``DragonDictate is just amazing. It allows me to go back to typing
and editing my work.''
   The system adjusts to each user's voice and vocabulary because
individual voices can vary widely.
   DragonDictate is compatible with an IBM personal computer with a
386 microprocessor.

<HEAD>Change in Eastern Europe Spurs Activity At U.S. Think Tanks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   These are heady days at the Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution and Peace, where scholars surrounded
by the largest collection of Soviet papers outside the Kremlin hope
to close the book on communism.
   They are scouring Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, sweeping
up papers, posters and other artifacts to add to the 25 miles of
library shelves that house everything from the first editions of
Pravda to the latest speeches by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   The late President Hoover, a lifelong foe of communism, founded
the library with his own World War I collection two years after the
1917 Soviet revolution.
   Today, more than merely collecting, Hoover economists,
historians and political scientists are analyzing and playing a
role in the transition of the Soviet bloc by meeting with leaders
of the new governments and U.S. officials.
   Former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, an honorary fellow
at Hoover, and U.S. Ambassador to Czechoslovakia Shirley Temple
Black, a former member of Hoover's board of overseers, are helping
set up some of the meetings.
   ``We are in a new era that is revolutionary,'' Shultz said in an
interview in his office at Hoover, in the center of the Stanford
University campus.
   ``It is fascinating to think about the problems of transition
from one kind of system to another kind, how you manage that. Some
people here will be thinking about that and studying that and
trying to be helpful to people doing that through this period. I
want to be part of that process of change.''
   Other think tanks are similarly abuzz with scholars looking at
upheavals overseas.
   The Center for Strategic and International Studies, based in
Washington, sees its mission now as helping America cope with a
radically different world, said Robert E. Hunter, vice president of
the center's regional programs.
   Some of the academic cold warriors have even taken to gloating
about the changes in the Soviet bloc, which they believe were
pushed along by their policy recommendations.
   ``We absolutely feel vindicated,'' said Burton Yales Pines,
senior vice president of the conservative Heritage Foundation in
Washington. ``It's a nice feeling. It's not often that it's given
to people to feel victory the way we've felt it the last year and a
half.''
   But the general consensus among scholars that communism is dying
out, four months after the Berlin Wall began coming down, ``is
still based in some optimism,'' said Hoover acting Director John
Raisian.
   ``We're hopeful there won't be any fallbacks. It's not quite
over, but it's proceeding along those lines.''
   Recently retired Hoover director W. Glenn Campbell warns that
``communism is far from dead yet.
   ``No one has said communism is dead in China, North Korea or
Cuba. And there are enormous problems in privatizing all the
economies in the countries wrecked, getting a price system, getting
a foreign exchange. There are a whole host of problems and anything
can happen.''
   But there is a pervasive sense among some scholars that
communism has been exposed as a failed experiment.
   ``I think the idea that you can run a society or an economy
effectively by centrally placed authoritarian or dictatorial means
has been proven bankrupt,'' Shultz said.

   Sparkling with color, luxury and youthful abandon,
Christian Lacroix's show of ready-to-wear and Luxe lines was a
winner for women who want to have fun looking feminine.
   The lean pants, minis, tunics and fitted or smocky tops of the
ready-to-wear line shown Sunday melded right into the more
expensive Luxe.
   ``I love it,'' said John Fairchild, publisher of Women's Wear
Daily and W. ``It's highly decorative. He gives the clothes
personality more than any other designer, and it's never boring.''
   Looking pale but happy, Lacroix took a bow after the intimate
show in his shop on a sunny day. He still is recovering from two
back operations and walked stiffly.
   The eye-catching clothes went from reversible shocking pink and
orange shortie trapeze toppers over pink tights and orange suede
over-the-knee boots to little burgundy-yellow-black bicycle tights
with pullovers or V-necked mini-tunics in chartreuse and rust with
ribbed tights.
   Lacroix also worked with a wealth of fabrics. Typical was an
outfit featuring a jewel-buttoned burgundy and yellow jacket in a
patchwork of little hearts and geometrics over a flowered tapestry
miniskirt.
   Lacroix's favorite folklore themes were in both collections,
like the opulent fortuneteller or gypsy skirts with velvet star and
baroque embroideries on jackets and full multicolored silk skirts.
   He also made a hit with his bright pink suits, elaborately
embroidered and piped with lush black velvet.
   When presented with boleros, these ``suits of light'' were a
dashing salute to the bull rings of Spain and Lacroix's native
Arles.
   From the simple black crepe sheath with its split skirt topped
by a jeweled flower, to the little white satin collared navy
georgette and chiffon numbers with flippy godet flares, the clothes
were showy, fun and luxurious.
   ``Totally wearable and saleable,'' said Ellin Saltzman, vice
president and creative director of R.H. Macy.
   Lynn Manulis of Martha's boutiques, another American who adored
the show, said: ``I'd like to buy the whole collection. It's varied
and cohesive; he has a kind of genius. I think finally the public
is ready for him. This seems to point the way we're going.''
   Another winner for color was Italian Enrico Coveri. He drew
inspiration from the ski slopes, showing brightly flowered long
pullovers paired with stretch tights, plus some hot numbers based
on ski suits appliqued with starfish designs.
   His plaid suits with long tweed jackets, matching brimmed hats
and shortie sarong-split skirts were fetching for daytime. And the
gym-suit body stocking worn with lame boots and a cape of
multicolored outsized mirror sequins would knock them dead on the
ski scene.
   Meanwhile, Italian Romeo Gigli's Saturday night show drew kudos
for artistry.
   Gigli went on his usual exotic trip of fabrics, producing
heart-shaped coats in luxurious silks and velvets of brown and
bordeaux.
   The coats, worn over narrow stretch pants, often had shawl
collars so huge they completely engulfed necks and shoulders _ the
neckless, shoulderless look all part of the heart-shaped silhouette.
   In shades of bordeaux, rust and fuchsia, Gigli played around
with the big-collared shortie coats crackling with flame-shaped
hems over the leanest striped pants. That outfit was topped by a
gold-embroidered red velvet wimple.

<HEAD>What Do Heart Doctors Eat In The Cholesterol Capital Of America?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET McCONNAUGHEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In New Orleans, it seems almost every other
recipe begins, ``Take a stick of butter ...'' What isn't cooked
with butter is likely to be deep-fried or seasoned with fat pork.
   So what will 24,000 heart doctors eat during the American
College of Cardiology's convention this week?
   ``At all the official events, we serve heart-healthy foods so
`60 Minutes' doesn't end up at our convention and show that there's
a contradiction of terms going on,'' said Linda Karson, director of
meeting services for the American College of Cardiology.
   That means cereal, muffins, yogurt and fruit for breakfast,
rather than eggs Sardou or any of the other cholesterol-laden local
breakfast favorites. Lunches and dinner menus are heavy on fish and
chicken, with vegetables and lots of green and pasta salads.
   One of the biggest challenges, Karson said, was working up a
menu for Tuesday night's ``Sights, Sounds, Music, Food and Culture
of New Orleans.''
   ``Doing heart-healthy food in New Orleans is kind of a
contradiction in terms,'' she acknowledged.
   Tuesday night's menu includes ``Cajun potpourri gumbo'' with
chicken and fish but without cholesterol-laden shellfish _ an
essential ingredient of seafood gumbo _ or sausage, which is almost
always included with chicken.
   The red beans and rice will not have any salt pork or ham hocks,
and the po-boy sandwiches will have lean meat and low-cholesterol
mayo. The andouille sausage will be made with turkey, and the
jambalaya with chicken.
   ``We'll give them the atmosphere of it, more than the actual
food,'' said Karson.
   But even heart doctors are likely to splurge on their diets in
New Orleans. In November, Mother's restaurant, which specializes in
po-boys, sausage-and-chicken jambalaya and pork-seasoned red beans,
was full of conventioneers wearing American Heart Association
nametags.
   Doctors could be seen in tonier restaurants at dinner, chowing
down on red meat, chicken and fish with buttery sauces, and New
Orleans-style barbecued shrimp, which comes to the table swimming
in spicy butter.
   ``I think the majority of people, when they hit New Orleans,
kind of say `Well, throw it to the winds,''' said Kermit Cosse,
associate general manager at Antoine's. ``We're known for so many
restaurants in New Orleans, and we're known for food.''
   But Lally Brennan, one of the workers at Commander's Palace,
said the restaurant includes light entrees on the menu and finds
many heart doctors take advantage of them.
   ``Whenever we have cardiologists in town, they always want
lighter-type foods,'' she said. ``We put lots of fish on the menu
with light sauces because we know they'll ask for it. We still have
our other goodies if they want to splurge. But we expect them to
order a lot of the lighter things.''
   The food vendors at the New Orleans Convention Center will offer
some healthy foods as well as their standard hot dogs, hamburgers
and sandwiches, Karson said.
   ``They did offer a whole lot of heart-healthy food during the
American Heart Association meeting,'' she said. ``The big joke is
they've got caseloads of turkey dogs left. They didn't really go.''
   Karson acknowledged that meeting organizers can't stop private
concessionaires from selling _ nor doctors from eating _ what they
want at the convention.
   ``We won't say everyone's real concerned about heart-healthy
food,'' she said. ``But at least we can say we've made a real
effort to provide it.''

   Sylvia Jenkins is matter-of-fact about the
drug conviction that landed her in federal prison, but mention her
two young grandchildren and tears trickle down her cheeks.
   ``It's very hard,'' said Jenkins, who won't let the children
visit her because she hates to watch them leave. ``Every time they
want to come up, I say, `Not this weekend.'''
   Jenkins, 52, is pulling a five-year stretch at the Federal
Correctional Institution in Danbury. She has a running track, a
view of gentle hills and a job as a tutor.
   And now, there are also innovative programs to help people like
her deal with the emotions of being a mother or grandmother behind
bars _ and the reunion when she finishes her time.
   There are more than 2,000 mothers in federal prisons across the
country. The system is providing such things as parenting classes
and special visitation days.
   The government wants female inmates to be better prepared when
they leave prison to deal with their families, said Ann Bartolo,
chief of the female offender section of the federal Bureau of
Prisons.
   Bartolo's latest project is a program allowing pregnant inmates
to stay at halfway houses three months after giving birth so they
can keep the babies with them. Mothers now can keep their babies
only two days before giving them to relatives or foster families.
   About 3,150 women live in eight permanent and five temporary
facilities in the federal prison system. About 75 percent have
children, ranging in age from 6 months to 45 years. Fifty inmates
are pregnant.
   Danbury is considered one of the better prisons. It's a
minimum-security camp on the fringe of a men's penitentiary. There
are no bars, and pictures of loved ones are allowed atop short
metal lockers where inmates keep their clothes.
   The prison started a special family day last year, allowing
children inside for a day to see where mother eats and sleeps.
   ``It's fairly relaxed. There's nothing up there that gives you a
prison atmosphere,'' said superintendent John Sullivan, a father of
seven who oversees 170 women in the camp and 1,100 men in the
penitentiary.
   Children also attend events like graduations, where they see
their mothers in caps and gowns accepting high school diplomas.
   Another of the federal system's programs has playrooms in
women's prisons and sets up a counseling service for family
emergencies, such as drug arrests or bad grades in school, Bartolo
said.
   A parenting class is so popular in Danbury it even draws inmates
without children. The program helps women understand their
relationship with their own parents while teaching them to deal
with their children.
   ``It's training the inmate in parenting skills _ what does it
mean now that they're going to be in for X amount of years and this
child most likely will be attached to a foster parent,'' Bartolo
said.
   ``It helps the mother (after she's released) to slowly walk into
this child's life and also to deal with her skills as a parent, how
to deal with discipline and anger the child feels that she wasn't
with her all the time.''

   A program aimed at keeping students in school
by cutting welfare payments to families whose children have poor
attendance has been ineffective, according to a study by the
University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.
   Only 28 percent of Milwaukee County teen-agers affected by Gov.
Tommy G. Thompson's welfare reform measure returned to school and
were still there after two months, according to the university's
Employment &amp; Training Institute.
   Payments from Aid to Families with Dependent Children were
reduced by $3.4 million because of penalties assessed by the
program, the study showed. More than 3,700 teens in the county are
subject to the Learnfare program.
   The university study was conducted by John Pawasarat and Lois
Quinn, who examined more than 4 million records from the Milwaukee
County Department of Social Services.
   The new study proves Learnfare is not effective, Michael Soika,
associate director of the Office of Social Concerns for the
Milwaukee Catholic Archdiocese, said this weekend.
   ``Under the pretext of helping them, we are exacerbating their
problem by taking money away from them, and I would suspect,
creating more turmoil and tension in their lives,'' he said.

<HEAD>Renewed Emphasis on Wetlands Could Hamper Delta Development</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Guidelines to protect the wetlands
along the lower Mississippi River are slowing development and could
reverse the economic revival sought by Congress for this
poverty-stricken region, some officials say.
   Farmers' plans to dig ditches, build dikes or ponds and clear
land have been put on hold. And as the construction season
approaches, developers fear delays, paperwork, and the mitigation
of land will increase building costs.
   ``We're just about going to miss the work season,'' said Dennis
Sorrell of Bond Engineering in West Memphis. Sorrel said he has
residential subdivisions, a county health building, apartment
complexes and other industrial projects on hold.
   ``When developers don't develop, engineers don't work, lumber
companies don't sell lumber, carpenters don't work,'' he said.
   Under new federal guidelines, developers and farmers must obtain
a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers before turning
a spade of dirt in the wetlands. Yet no Section 404 permits have
been issued in Arkansas, and a Corps spokesman said none would be
issued for ``some time.''
   The new ``no net loss'' policy, spurred by Bush administration
efforts to comply with environmental laws, states wetlands that
have been taken over must be replaced. Also, the amount of lands
defined as wetlands has increased.
   Roughly three-fourths of the region now meets the new
definition, instead of about 20 percent previously classified as
wetlands, according to the Lower Mississippi Delta Development
Commission.
   Ron Murphy, a natural resources specialist with the
Memphis-based commission, said the new definition does not
distinguish between different land.
   ``We've got to identify that high quality wetland, and then
there needs to be some balance struck,'' he said.
   ``We're looking into it as a major problem. The wetlands policy
is going to have a significant impact'' on economic development in
the delta, he said.
   The development commission has scheduled meetings this week with
members of Congress from Arkansas and other states on possible
legislative remedies to the new wetlands policy.
   Wetlands regulations changed to become more uniform, said Furcy
Zeringue, a Corps of Engineers project manager.
   ``There is a lack of certainty as to the amount and type of
mitigation that will be acceptable or will be needed for certain
types of projects,'' he said.
   People who change the use of wetlands could be forced to replace
that acreage with new wetlands, and costs eventually would be
passed on to consumers, developers said.
   Another problem is the time needed to get a permit, which can
take up to 90 days.
   Bruce Blackall, executive director of the Arkansas Home Builders
Association, said that while wetlands must be protected, ``it may
be the pendulum swung too far.''

   Germans from both sides of the
border turned this decaying industrial town into a symbol of unity,
celebrating the East German elections as the prelude to a merger.
   Crowds filled the dusty, cobblestone streets and squares. A huge
traffic jam paralyzed the city as thousands of West Germans crossed
the border to join the celebration.
   Many believed East Germany's first free elections were also the
formerly Communist country's last as a separate state and
reunification with the West was the inevitable next step.
   ``The pressure right now for unification is immense,'' said Rolf
Bode, 29, a building manager in this city of 50,000 about 10 miles
from the border.
   Eisenach is home to the country's second-largest automaker, the
VEB Automobile Werk Eisenach, which employs about 10,000 people.
   ``Of course we want a united Germany,'' said Peter Voigt, 40, a
technician. ``We speak the same language. We have a long shared
tradition. And we belong together.''
   Cornelia Bode, 30, a nurse who says she has often thought about
emigrating to the West said: ``The people want the unification
above everything ... occupation powers here as well as over there
have to go now.''
   Erhardt Jung, a 35-year-old metal worker, said he voted for the
Christian Democrats because the party has drawn the clearest and
quickest line for unification.
   ``I'm looking forward to a true free market here,'' he said.
``The central economy was a farce. It has to go forwards from here:
unification as quickly as possible.''
   Wilhelm Guenther, a 62-year-old accountant, said plans for a
rapid unification and immediate investment from the ``big German
brother'' to the West were the only ways to prevent more East
Germans from leaving the country.
   An estimated 2,500 East Germans have left the country each day
since the start of the year.
   ``The overwhelming majority are for a speedy unification,' he
said. ``If there's a unification, there will be no reason to leave.
It has to happen fast.''

   Shining Path guerrillas kidnapped three adults

found near Bardon's body, gravely wounded. Police said both men
showed signs of torture.
   The other adult and the two children, a boy and a girl, were
still missing after being seized Saturday by the Maoist-inspired
rebels in a village three miles north of Huanuco. The candidate,
Luis Alva Castro, held a rally Saturday night in Huanuco is 165
miles northeast of the capital, Lima.
   When they were abducted, the campaign workers were driving in a
pickup truck equipped with loudspeakers and broadcasting messages
urging people to attend the rally.
   Alva Castro is candidate for the center-left Aprista party of
President Alan Garcia in presidential elections scheduled for April
8.
   He is currently a distant second in public opinion polls to
center-right candidate Mario Vargas Llosa, an acclaimed novelist.
   In a statement issued Sunday condemning the murder, Alva Castro
said, ``This has been a terrifying situation.'' The statement said:
``Bardon was savagely tortured during more than eight hours.''
   The Shining Path began its armed insurgency against Peru's
elected governments 10 years ago. The government says more than
18,000 people have died in the violence, including police,
soldiers, rebels, government officials and civilians.

<HEAD>Anxiety Over Interests Rates Sends Market Into Nosedive; Dollar Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo market's anxiety about a possible
interest rate hike and the yen's decline against the dollar sent
the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange plummeting to a 14-month
low today.
   The dollar, meanwhile, rose sharply against the yen to a mark a
three-year high, fueled by the currency's bullishness in overseas
markets and Tokyo's poor performance.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which fell
55.20 points on Friday, plunged 1,353.20 points, or 4.15 percent,
today. Its closing of 31,263.24 was the lowest since it closed at
31,170.38 on Jan. 20, 1989.
   The Nikkei's decline today was the third biggest single-day
decline for the index. It plunged 3,836.48, or 14.9 percent, on
Oct. 20, 1987, in the worldwide ``Black Monday'' stock market
crash, and 1,569.10 points, or 4.50 percent, on Feb. 26.
   In today's early trading, the index rose 105 points as investors
were encouraged by Friday's gains on Wall Street. But early
optimism was followed by a sharp late morning decline as
institutional investors began cashing in their trust funds.
   ``The anxiety about the interest rate hike, coupled with the
weak yen against the dollar are the main causes of today's fall,''
said Ichitaro Watanabe, a dealer with Nikko Securities Co. ``The
market as a whole appears very pessimistic about the current
situation and I have heard that there was some panic selling.''
   He added that a sharp fall in index future prices also triggered
massive selling on the spot market.
   ``There was not one outstanding reason for the Nikkei's fall
today,'' said Keiichi Nishida of Kidder Peabody Securities. ``But,
rather, while the market as a whole lacks buying incentives
entirely, a series of bad news such as the interest rate hike and
unstable exchange rates hit the market, triggering the sharp fall.''
   Nishida warned that ``because Monday's drop was not the result
of panic selling, there is a widely shared fear in the market that
share prices may fall even further until they really hit the
bottom.''
   ``But at this point, no one knows where the bottom really is,''
he added.
   A share of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., which once was
the driving force of the affluent Tokyo exchange, declined 20,000
yen from the previous day's close to finish at 1.8 million yen, the
lowest since it was released in the market in April 1986.
   In the currency market, the dollar closed at 153.55 yen, up 1.05
yen from Friday's close of 152.50 yen. After opening at 152.48 yen,
it seesawed in a wide range of 152.35-153.80 yen.
   Currency dealers said the dollar was firm against the Japanese
yen even though the American currency was sold against the West
German mark because of the conservatives' impressive showing Sunday
in East Germany's elections.
   The Nikkei's sharp drop in the stock market prompted the market
players' selling of the yen for the dollar, giving a stronger
upward push to the American currency, they said.
   ``The market players were expecting to see a stronger yen today
as the speculation about a possible interest rate hike on Tuesday
swirled around the market,'' said a dealer with Daiichi Kangyo
Bank, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``But after seeing the unexpectedly bullish dollar Monday
morning, players began buying the dollar almost one-sidedly,'' he
added. ``I would not be surprised to see the dollar surpass the
154-yen mark before the interest rate hike actually happens.''
   Dealers said the Bank of Japan made ``large-scale
interventions'' throughout today to stem the yen's fall. One dealer
with Daiichi Kangyo Bank said the central bank bought at least $1
billion worth of the Japanese yen today.
   But Masaaki Tanahashi, a dealer with the Mitsui Bank, said some
market players were hesitating to buy the yen until the Bank of
Japan decides to raise its official discount rate from the current
4.25 percent.
   Japanese media have speculated for weeks that the Bank of Japan
will raise its key lending rate, charged for loans to commercial
banks, by as much as one percentage point.
   This would affect other domestic interest rates.

   The French Socialist Party congress ended
in failure Sunday with the struggle for the leadership unresolved
and the party unable to agree on a basic political program.
   The power struggle between major personalities that has rent the
party in recent months went down to the wire and all-night attempts
to work out a compromise in committee ultimately failed.
   There was virtually no debate during the four-day congress on
the major issues facing the country, such as unemployment or the
future of Europe.
   Throughout the congress, the party's top figures declared they
wanted to compromise and merge their various agendas into a single
political program for the next three years. But none budged from
the position he came with.
   The next national legislative elections are not scheduled until
1993, and the presidential election is set for 1995. But jockeying
for power and support already is in full swing.
   There were seven motions, or platforms, put forth for party
members to choose from. Pre-congress voting among the 7,200 party
militants from the various local federations put the motions of
party First Secretary Pierre Mauroy, allied with former First
Secretary Lionel Jospin, in a dead heat with former Premier Laurent
Fabius, protege of President Francois Mitterrand and possessor of
clear ambitions for the Elysee Palace.
   The official count _ contested by Fabius and his followers _
gave the Mauroy forces 28.9 percent of the vote, a hair ahead of
Fabius with 28.8 percent. In third place was Premier Michel Rocard
with 24.3 percent but Rocard, a presidential hopeful who controls
only a minority in the party, refused to choose sides.
   Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement, who won 8.5 percent of
the vote and has made no secret of his interest in the presidency,
threw his support behind the Mauroy-Jospin motion, and Jean
Poperen, minister for relations with Parliament in the Rocard
government, who won 7.2 percent, backed Fabius.
   Two other motions won a total of 2 percent of the vote.
   Leaders of the various factions scheduled a meeting for Tuesday
in Paris to try to write a program that will rally the party around
a single platform and work out a deal on who gets the top
leadership positions. If that fails, the matter will be decided by
the party's board of directors, scheduled to meet on Wednesday.
   The makeup of the board of directors, named last week, is
proportional to the votes received by the various motions. Thus the
scramble will be on to forge alliances with smaller factions.
   This was the first congress in the history of the party that was
unable to find a clear majority faction to rally and lead a unified
party. The fight essentially involved two figures who both claim to
be the inheritors of the mantle of Mitterrand _ Jospin, the man who
followed Mitterrand as the head of the party, and Fabius, once
France's youngest premier, who has made a career on Mitterrand's
coattails.

<HEAD>Pepsi Founder Dies at 94</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL GEITNER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walter S. Mack, who rescued a largely unknown
Pepsi-Cola Co. during the Depression and turned it into the
country's No. 2 soft drink maker, has died after a lengthy illness.
He was 94.
   Mack died in his sleep early Sunday at his Manhattan home, where
he had been recuperating from a December bout with pneumonia and
heart disease, said his son, Walter S. Mack Jr.
   During the 1930s, Mack tackled the job of reviving troubled but
promising companies.
   It was while trying to save the New York-based Loft's candy
chain that he took a special interest in its Pepsi syrup division.
Pepsi was spun off and Mack became its president in 1938.
   Loft's had sold the syrup formulated by a North Carolina
druggist in 1893 only to candy stores.
   It made little headway in the market until Mack broke
Coca-Cola's control of the name ``cola'' in a historic fight with
Coke chief Robert Woodruff.
   Mack also bought what he called ``the first commercial jingle
ever heard on the air.'' The jingle played in the first 30- and
60-second network spots:
   ``Pepsi-Cola hits the spot,
   ``Twelve full ounces, that's a lot,
   ``Twice as much for a nickel, too,
   ``Pepsi-Cola is the drink for you.''
   By the early 1940s, Pepsi was an international giant second only
to Coca-Cola in sales.
   After stepping down as Pepsi president in 1951, he ran the
Nedick's hot dog chain and headed several other companies.
   Mack graduated from Harvard in 1917 and volunteered for war
service. He later won a commission to the U.S. Naval Academy at
Annapolis, Md.
   He started the Young Republican Club in the Democratic bastion
of New York City. He ran unsuccessfully for the state Senate in
1932 and worked on Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia's mayoral campaigns. He
also served as chairman of the New York County Republican Committee.
   ``He was an extraordinarily energetic and creative man,'' said
Republican state Sen. Roy M. Goodman.
   In 1978, at 82, Mack brought together a group of former cola
company executives to launch King-Cola Corp. It filed for
bankruptcy three years later.
   ``Work keeps me alive, as it does a great many people,'' he
testified before the House Select Committee on Aging in 1981.
   Mack remained active until about two years ago, his son said.
   ``As he aged he came more to believe that you do your best and
keep trying and if things don't work out you keep going,'' Walter
Jr. said. ``That's probably what kept him young.''
   His wife, Ruth, died in 1986. He is survived by two sons, Walter
Jr., an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan, and Anthony of Los
Angeles; and two daughters, Alice M. Sawyer of Wilmington, Del.,
and Florence Ann Kelly of Manhattan.
   A memorial service was planned for Thursday at the Beth-El
Chapel at Temple Emanu-El, where Mack was treasurer for 56 years.

   Lothar de Maiziere, the favorite to become
East Germany's first popularly elected premier, dealt with his
party's past as a supporter of the ousted hard-line Communists by
openly acknowledging mistakes.
   The conservative alliance that won East Germany's first free
elections Sunday is led by de Maiziere's Christian Democrats,
putting the 50-year-old former head of the country's Luthern Church
Council in an excellent position to head a new government.
   At a frenzied celebration at party headquarters Sunday night,
the lawyer who took charge of the Christian Democratic Union after
last fall's peaceful popular revolution sidestepped questions about
being chosen premier.
   ``We have an enormously large responsibility,'' he said of his
party.
   De Maiziere is a fervent supporter of quick unification with
West Germany and now embarks on forging a governing coalition
because his party fell just short of a majority in the balloting.
   ``I don't want to talk about personnel questions tonight. I
don't want to burden the coalition negotiations,'' he said. ``I
just want to celebrate.''
   Until last fall, de Maiziere's party was one of the four that
had seats in a puppet Parliament and was controlled by the
hard-line Communists.
   De Maiziere has acknowledged his party was financed by the
Communists in exchange for giving parliamentary support. He has
also admitted that some Christian Democratic leaders, like ousted
Communists, stole party funds.
   The party leader has also said his party's past will hinder a
fresh start in a democratic East Germany. Many East Germans now
openly despise people who supported the ousted hard-line Communist
regime.
   De Maiziere, who is married and has three daughters, rose to
prominence after the popular revolution last fall as deputy premier
in the caretaker government of reformist Communist Premier Hans
Modrow.
   In the election, however, his party embraced support from West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats.
   De Maiziere has strong personal ties to West Germany.
   His uncle, Ulrich de Maiziere, held a top post in the West
German army. His cousin, Thomas de Maiziere, is the West Berlin
spokesman for West Germany's Christian Democrats.
   De Maiziere is descended from a prominent Huguenot family. He is
married, has three daughters and is a talented viola player.

<HEAD>Ronald and Nancy Reagan Visit Burned Youth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ronald and Nancy Reagan are the latest in a
string of notables to come to the hospital bedside of David Opont,
the 12-year-old boy fighting back from a nightmarish attack by a
bully who set him afire.
   The Reagans visited the severely burned boy Sunday evening at
New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, just hours after the
youth had had a visit from actor Bill Cosby.
   The outpouring of sympathy and good wishes from around the
country, most of it from people he's never met, began after the
March 7 attack by a 13-year-old boy from David's neighborhood.
   More than 400 cards and letters arrived in a single day, along
with an assortment of stuffed animals, posters and baseball caps.
He also received numerous gifts, flowers and balloons on his 12th
birthday, the day after the brutal attack.
   ``You not only can have a great feeling for him and his
recovery, but down deep there is a resentment that these things can
happen,'' the former president said after spending a few minutes
with Opont.
   If his recovery goes perfectly, David could be out of the
hospital in June. If there are any complications, he could die. His
chances of making a full recovery remain only 50-50, doctors said.
   A fund set up to cover David's massive medical expenses received
between 15,000 and 20,000 donations in five days, said Opont family
lawyer Michael Prieto, who is overseeing the contributions. About
two dozen local clergy are holding a week-long prayer vigil at the
hospital, where David will probably spend the next 12 weeks.
   In addition, skin banks run by the Vietnam Veterans of America
and the New York Firefighters Skin Bank have offered to assist the
youth.
   ``The horror of the crime, the heinous nature of this crime, and
the ages of the people involved have helped produce this
response,'' said Prieto.
   Diana Goldin, a hospital spokeswoman, said the heavily bandaged
boy was delighted with the visit from Cosby.
   ``David recognized him and was very pleased. He (Cosby) joked
around with him,'' she said.
   The Reagans, who flew in from California Sunday for an award
ceremony Monday night, asked to visit Opont after reading about his
plight.
   Naomi Opont, David's sister, said David brightened up and gave a
small smile when he saw the Reagans, but did not speak. He can't
smile a lot because it hurts, she said.
   Others who have donned hospital garb to offer their support
include Mayor David Dinkins and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
   His optimism and spirit have won over the hospital staff.
   ``He's a fighter. If you ask him does it hurt, he says `no,'
even during procedures we know are uncomfortable,'' said Dr. Cleon
Goodwin, head of the hospital burn unit. ``He's tough.''
   David's attacker, a 13-year-old whose name is being withheld
because of his age, allegedly admitted torching the youth after
tying him to a railing inside an abandoned garage. In chilling
testimony, Detective George Klingberg quoted the suspect's account
of the incident:
   ``I walked over to him. I lit a match. I held it up to his
shirt. His shirt caught on fire, and I got scared and ran off.''
   Opont originally told relatives he was torched because he
refused to smoke crack but no drug charges were filed against the
suspect.
   David wound up with second- and third-degree burns over 55
percent of his body.
   The attack nearly ended the dream David brought with him when he
arrived in New York 18 months ago from Port-au-Prince, Haiti. He
came over with his sister, Naomi, and was reunited with their
father, Luther, who had immigrated in 1981.
   While David initially spoke his native Creole and very little
English, he became a good student and applied himself in school. A
school photo of David, shows the boy, in a jacket and tie, looking
seriously into the camera.
   His sister said the 12-year-old's goal was to become a doctor
and support their mother, Premese, who works as a seamstress. On
the morning he was beaten, bound and burned, David was walking with
friends to the Walt Whitman Intermediate School.
   ``All the teachers like him at school because he's fun,'' his
sister said. ``He always has a story to tell them, but he's
well-behaved.''
   David's passions were like those of any other 12-year-old: He
enjoys rap music, Nintendo games and ``The Cosby Show.'' His first
Saturday in the hospital, the boy asked to watch cartoons.
   But the scars will remain with him for life, both physically and
emotionally, doctors said. The boy will need many years of
psychological after-care, said Goodwin.
   The effect on David's family is harder to assess.
   In the days after the burning, his parents and other family
members were stunned by the viciousness of the attack and shaken by
the severity of David's condition.
   ``I cannot believe a guy would do that,'' said an anguished
Odridge Opont, a cousin of the burned youth. ``This family cannot
believe what happened to David.''
   Seated nearby in the hospital lobby, the boy's father sobbed and
shook, his head in his hands. ``He's not OK yet,'' Luther Opont
said softly before walking away.

<HEAD>Report: Hacker Entered Once-Plagued Internet Computer System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rogue computer program that steals electronic
documents and covers its own tracks has invaded dozens of computers
in a nationwide computer network, a published report said.
   The program has infiltrated the computers of corporations,
non-classified military installations, government laboratories and
several universities, The New York Times reported in today's
editions.
   Los Alamos National Laboratory, Digital Equipment Corporation,
Harvard University, Boston University and the University of Texas
are among the affected institutions, unidentified investigators
told the Times.
   The computer network is Internet, a worldwide collection of
computer systems that links corporations, government projects and
universities together.
   Government computer security teams have been unable to trace the
source of the illegal program.
   Their job has been especially difficult because the program
automatically erases computer files that would help them trace
break-ins, the newspaper said.
   No classified military computers have been affected and damage
has been slight to the Internet system, unidentified government
officials told the newspaper.
   The computer attack is being run through a single hidden
location. But in order to avoid detection, the hacker is connecting
to Internet through a series of computers.
   The program is designed to find a file containing the system's
passwords and copy the file into another computer for decoding.
   Some of the break-ins were traced to Texas and New Mexico before
investigators lost the trail.
   Internet was thrown into chaos in November 1988 when a program
written by Robert Tappan Morris, a graduate student at Cornell
University, jammed the system.
   The new program is not the same as one that Morris used. That
program, called a worm, copied itself from computer to computer, as
a computer virus does.
   ``The computer virus frenzy is not the real problem,'' said
Peter Neumann, a computer security expert at SRI International, a
research center in Menlo Park, Calif. ``The real problem is the
fact that the computers are so vulnerable, and whether the attack
is by one person at a computer or a program like a worm or virus,
they're all exploiting the same problem _ the vulnerability of our
computer systems.''

   It was standing room only at the wedding of
Kevin Lerch and Vanessa LaClair. Standing room for the bride, the
groom, six guests and the town justice.
   Even then, the church was crowded.
   Lerch, 24, and LaClair, 23, Saturday became the first couple
married in the world's smallest church _ Cross Island Chapel,
measuring 3{ by 6 feet.
   The chapel was built last December on an island in a two-acre
pond in the upstate New York town of Verona, 20 miles east of
Syracuse. Chandler Mason said he built the chapel both to honor God
and to draw tourists to the rural town.
   Mason received a letter from Guinness Book of World Records
confirming the chapel's title as world's smallest church. It will
replace the Union Church in Wiscasset, Maine, in the book's next
printing.
   The chapel has white aluminum siding, three cathedral-shaped
windows, and a 5-foot steeple.
   The wedding party _ Lerch, LaClair, their parents, two
attendants and town justice David Reed _ rowed to the island in two
small boats. About 40 guests stood in a downpour to watch from
shore.
   Lerch said he and LaClair, both of nearby Oneida, visited the
church in December when the pond was frozen.
   ``We got engaged to be married in October. We came out here on
the ice and we thought it would be fun. It would be different,'' he
said.

   Showers fell across the Northwest today, and more rain was
falling in the South along a low front that hugged the Appalachians.
   Flurries were predicted for the Ohio Valley through New York as
temperatures cooled after last week's bout of unseasonable warmth.
   Extensive flooding was reported Sunday on the Chattahoochee
River in Georgia as it neared its crest at Tailwater and George
Dam, its highest level since 1929.
   The Kinchafoonee Creek crested at Peston, Ga., the National
Weather Service reported Sunday.
   Along the Oostanaula River, there has been widespread flooding
at Rome and Resaca, Ga. The Etowah River crested at Canton, Ga.,
but the river level was falling slowly and flooding continued.
   Flooding in Alabama left 3,700 homeless and 10 dead over the
weekend.
   Sunday evening, rain stretched from northeast Oklahoma across
southwest Missouri to northwest Kentucky and central Illinois. The
front moved slowly eastward, past central Indiana and west-central
Ohio.
   Snow showers were scattered over Michigan, Wisconsin and eastern
Minnesota. Flurries also were expected today in the Northeast.
   The high temperature for the nation Sunday was 95 degrees in
California at Palm Springs, Thermal and Death Valley.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed, Gold Little Changed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar kicked off the European trading week
mixed. Currency dealers said today the markets want to assess the
significance of East Germany's elections and the Tokyo stock
market's sharp overnight drop.
   Gold prices were little changed.
   ``I don't expect much movement in the dollar,'' said one trader
in Milan, Italy. ``The market is essentially trendless with the
dollar slightly bid.''
   Sunday's landslide victory for East Germany's conservative
parties is expected to lead to solid gains by the Deutsche mark.
But lingering concerns about the exchange rate to be adopted by the
two Germanys ahead of unification could continue to temper some
investors' enthusiasm in the longer term.
   ``I don't want to be on the trading desk the day the monetary
union comes,'' said one dealer at a European bank in Frankfurt.
``We just don't know what will happen.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose to a three-year high, closing at 153.55 yen. That,
plus anxiety about a possible interest rate increase, sent the key
Nikkei Stock Average plummeting to a 14-month low.
   Later, in London, the dollar was quoted at 153.54 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   _1.6873 West German marks, down from 1.6945
   _1.5085 Swiss francs, up from 1.5080
   _5.7025 French francs, down from 5.7245
   _1.9005 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9077
   _1,245.50 Italian lire, down from 1,251.00
   _1.1855 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1802
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound, and was
quoted at 1.6140 dollars, compared with 1.6235 dollars late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $401.50 a troy ounce, up
from $400.50 bid late Friday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $401.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $401.00, unchanged from late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.15 to close at a bid $402.04.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.13 a troy
ounce, unchanged from late Friday.

<HEAD>Three Shrines in Tokyo Razed, Arson Suspected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Shinto shrines in Tokyo were burned to the
ground before dawn today, and police said they suspected
ultra-leftist extremists.
   No one was hurt in the three separate fires at the shrines of
Japan's native religion, said an official of the Tokyo Metropolitan
Police Department.
   The official, who requested anonymity, said investigators
believed it was arson because batteries and electric cords such as
those used in detonators were found near two of the shrines.
   He identified the three wooden shrines as the Hikawa Shrine,
Shinmei Shrine and Shirahige Shrine, each several miles apart. The
fires occurred at around 3 a.m.
   On Feb. 3, 1989, Togo Shrine in central Tokyo was damaged by a
predawn explosion that shattered more than a dozen windows and
burned a covered passageway.
   The ultra-leftist Kakurokyo, or Revolutionary Workers'
Association, claimed responsibility for that attack, and a leader
of the group was later arrested. Radical groups in Japan strongly
oppose the monarchy and its traditionally close relationship with
Shinto.
   The official said radical involvement in Monday's fires was
being investigated, but refused further comment.
   Also Monday, 5,500 riot police were mobilized to remove a tower
built illegally on the site of planned expansion of Tokyo's New
International Airport.
   A 150-ton steel cage was lowered over the 50-foot tower as six
anti-airport radicals atop hurled firebombs, the official said.
Riot police countered with water cannon.
   There were no reports of injuries on either side, the official
said.
   Since last December, riot police have removed two similar
structures where a new runway for the New Tokyo International
Airport at Narita, 40 miles northwest of Tokyo, is under
construction.
   Eight more huts remain, according to airport authorities.
   Anti-government radical groups, backing local farmers, have
opposed the government's plans to expropriate farmland for the
additional runway.

<TEXT>
   An American woman who was
jailed two years for refusing to disclose the whereabouts of her
daughter was reunited with the girl over the weekend, then spent
today guarding her from the media.
   Dr. Elizabeth Morgan drove her daughter, 7-year-old Hilary
Foretich, the 200 yards to her school this morning after learning
that photographers and reporters were outside the hotel where
Hilary lives.
   She took a different route when she drove Hilary back to the
Diplomat Motel. Hilary has lived there with her maternal
grandparents since mid-1988.
   Morgan refused to speak to the media or allow herself to be
photographed with Hilary. She would not say how long she expected
to stay in Christchurch.
   Morgan, a plastic surgeon from Washington D.C., has accused her
ex-husband, Eric Foretich, of sexually abusing Hilary. She was
jailed 25 months in 1987 for refusing to reveal Hilary's
whereabouts.
   The girl and her grandparents came to live in New Zealand 18
months ago after living on the run in Canada and Europe.
   Foretich saw his daughter last week for the first time in more
than two years and has since returned to his Falls Church, Va.,
home where he works as a dental surgeon.
   He found Hilary in Christchurch three weeks ago. The New Zealand
Family Court is to rule on the custody issue and has barred
reporters from covering the proceedings. No date has been announced
for the hearing.

defeating KGB official in race; Picks up 4th graf, `Communist Party

   Latvia's People's Front emerged victorious today
after the Baltic republic's first free elections in 50 years, but
initial results showed it failed to achieve the majority needed to
press for independence.
   Meanwhile, reformers claimed victories in crucial runoff
elections Sunday in Russia, Byelorussia and the Ukraine, the Slavic
heartland that accounts for 80 percent of the Soviet Union's
territory and two-thirds of its population.
   In Moscow's Proletarsky district, former political prisoner
Victor Bulgakov defeated Yuri Gorbachev, a local KGB official, and
became a member of the city council.
   And in Leningrad, pro-democracy activists claimed many victories
in individual races and estimated they would control at least 65
percent of the city council, said Elena Zelinskaya of the Northwest
Information Agency.
   Communist Party officials scored some victories, she said,
mostly in the ``closed'' electoral districts such as army bases,
where campaigning is not allowed.
   Activists had hoped Sunday's elections to parliaments in the
Baltic republics of Latvia and Estonia, annexed by the Soviet Union
in 1940, would follow the lead of nearby Lithuania and bring
independence supporters to power. Estonia has not yet reported any
election results.
   Lithuania's parliament was taken by independence activists in
February and early March elections, and legislators declared the
republic independent on March 13.
   The Soviet Congress declared the move illegal and President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday gave the republic three days to
respond. He later offered to meet with Lithuanian lawmakers and a
delegation arrived in Moscow for talks today, just as the deadline
was expiring.
   Latvia followed Lithuania in legalizing political parties
several months ago. No such move was made in Estonia but several
parties put forward candidates without interference. The Soviet
Parliament legalized multiple political parties for the entire
country last Tuesday.
   In Latvia, People's Front supporters won 108 mandates to the
201-seat parliament, a large majority among the 170 legislators
elected, according to initial results cited by the Soviet news
agency Tass. But independence activists needed a two-thirds
majority to change Latvia's constitution.
   Among the newly elected lawmakers were 97 Commmunist Party
members, 34 of whom were supporters of the People's Front. Party
officials lost badly in the countryside but were victorious in
Latvia's capital of Riga, Tass reported.
   Voter turnout in Latvia was 70 percent, Tass said.
   Thousands of Popular Front supporters rallied in the Latvian
capital of Riga Sunday, urging voters to support their movement. At
least five other parties, including the Green or environmental
party, competed in the Latvian elections, Tass said.
   In Estonia, local journalist Michael Taro predicted the People's
Front would win about 35 of the 105 seats in the republic's
parliament, with 15 or 20 more going to other pro-independence
groups.
   Throughout the Slavic republics, from Moscow to Vorkuta in
northern Russia, reformers ran against Communist Party and
government officials. Voters chose among candidates in some 1,610
runoffs, held after no candidate gained 50 percent of the vote in
the main round on March 4.
   In Moscow city council races, the pro-democracy bloc claimed 10
of 14 contested seats, said Irina Boganseva of the Voters' Club.

   A city councilman's aide who claims comedian
Eddie Murphy stole his idea for a movie has a criminal record that
includes convictions for fraud, drug possession and theft,
according to published reports.
   Hafiz Farid, 37, sued Murphy earlier this month for allegedly
using a version of a screenplay he had written for the movie
``Harlem Nights.''
   Farid, whose given name is Darryl Anderson, served time in
federal prisons in Danbury, Conn., and Morgantown, W.Va., for two
offenses, including a scheme to steal tens of thousands of dollars
from federal student loan programs, according to the Sunday
Star-Ledger of Newark.
   Farid legally changed his name and works for Newark City
Councilman Ralph T. Grant Jr. He refused to discuss his criminal
record, but told the paper he has reformed.
   Grant said he is aware of Farid's criminal record but doesn't
believes it interferes with his ability to perform his job, which
involves representing the councilman at community functions.
   Farid's lawsuit against Murphy came a week after a New York
writer filed a suit accusing Murphy of stealing a story idea used
in the making of ``Harlem Nights.''
   Both lawsuits came just months after columnist Art Buchwald won
a judgment against Paramount Pictures, the parent company of Eddie
Murphy Productions, for using Buchwald's story, ``King For A Day,''
as the basis for the Murphy movie, ``Coming to America.''

   Former President Jimmy Carter today accused
Israel of violating the human rights of Palestinians in the
occupied territories and said such harsh treatment helps fuel the
Palestinian uprising.
   Carter, on a three-day visit to Israel as part of a Middle East
tour, cited as abuses Israeli detention of Palestinian activists
without trial, house demolitions as punishment and what he termed
``excessive use of firearms'' against Arab demonstrators.
   ``What we are talking about is an authoritative government that
is in charge that is depriving the people under its control of
their basic human rights,'' Carter told reporters.
   He added: ``I think the intefadeh is being perpetuated partially
by the abuse of the Palestinians.''
   Intefadeh is the Arabic word used by Palestinians for their
27-month revolt against Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   Israel captured the West Bank and east Jerusalem from Jordan and
the Gaza Strip from Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel
annexed east Jerusalem as part of its capital and rules the
territories through a military government.
   Israelie soldiers or civilians have killed 665 Palestinians
since the uprising began in December 1987. An additional 198
Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of
collaborating with Israeli authorities. Forty-three Israelis have
died in the violence.
   Israel has said force is necessary to put down Palestinian
violence and that actions such as detentions and house demolitions
deter anti-Israeli activities.
   Carter made his comments to reporters after a half-hour meeting
with the board of the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights
in the Occupied Territories. The group, founded by liberal Israeli
politicians and academics, monitors activities in the territories.
   He also met with 13 Palestinian leaders from the occupied
territories and representatives of Al Haq-Law in the Service of
Man, a Palestinian human rights group.
   Carter cited figures from the Israeli center indicating that
``almost one in four, 25 percent, of all the adult males among the
Palestinians have been arrested'' at one time or another since the
uprising began.
   He was also critical of Israel's ``administrative detention''
procedures, which allow the jailing of Palestinians without charges
or trial for up to a year.
   ``In addition, there have been about 650 Palestinians killed by
excessive use of firearms by the military that are not under
life-threatening situations,'' Carter said. ``A lot of these are
little children who have been killed. These things are very
disturbing to me and to the rest of the world.''
   Faisal Husseini, one of the Palestinian leaders who met with
Carter, said the former president ``was very concerned about human
rights and has a deep understanding of this problem.''
   Carter earlier visited Egypt, Jordan and Syria. He is to stop in
Tunis for talks with PLO leader Yasser Arafat before returning to
the United States.
   Carter said Sunday he believes Syrian leader Hafez Assad is
ready to negotiate peace with Israel.
   Carter told The Associated Press that after talks with the
Syrian president Thursday, he felt that Assad is ``ready to make
peace, under the framework of an international conference.''
   Syria, as well as nearly all Arab countries in the Middle East,
has refused to officially recognize Israel and has remained in a
technical state of war with the Jewish state since its
establishment in 1948.

<HEAD>Jane's: Soviet Army Hit by Unprecedented Wave of Murders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an unprecedented wave of murders, 59 Soviet
military officers ranging in rank from lieutenant to general were
slain last year, a military affairs newsletter said today.
   The newsletter, published by the respected Jane's Information
Group, said the murders ``appear to be part of the current move of
antipathy felt toward the armed forces, particularly among younger
age groups in ethnic regions.''
   In 1988 two officers were murdered, and in 1987 just one, it
said.
   ``Very few (of the murders) have been solved,'' and Soviet
authorities are disturbed that local law enforcement agencies ``are
either incapable of or not interested in carrying out any proper
line of inquiry,'' the newsletter said.
   It cited the case of Lt. Igor Kholostyakov, stabbed 14 times
while returning to his unit one night.
   ``In the case of Lt. Kholostyakov, the police official arrived
to `survey the scene,' while his dog promptly fell asleep. That was
nine months ago; since then nothing further has been done to bring
the murderer(s) to justice,'' the report said.
   It said a special section has been set up in the top military
prosecutor's office to work with local police and law offices. New
security guidelines are being drawn up to protect military
personnel.
   The murders come against a backdrop of rapidly rising crime in
the Soviet Union and ethnic unrest in various republics. Military
troops at times have been sent in to quell unrest. This year, they
became the target of Azerbaijani nationalists' anger when they were
deployed to stop ethnic violence in the Azerbaijani capital.
   The deaths listed in the newsletter did not include officers
killed in battle.
   In most cases, the place where the crime occurred was not stated
in Soviet accounts, said Richard Woff, who wrote the report. He
said this made it difficult to establish any geographic pattern to
the killings.

<HEAD>Deputy Prime Minister Withdraws Resignation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIJAY JOSHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal has
withdrawn his resignation, averting a crisis that had threatened to
shatter the tenuous unity of India's 3-month-old government.
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh refused to accept his deputy's
resignation and Devi Lal withdrew it on Sunday, senior Janata Dal
party leader Chimanbhai Patel said.
   Patel said Singh sent a letter to Devi Lal, saying ``the people
will never excuse us if we fail them.''
   ``Taking all this into account, Devi Lal decided to withdraw the
resignation,'' Patel told reporters.
   Devi Lal, a top Janata Dal leader, submitted his resignation
from the Cabinet on Friday after ferocious political and press
criticism of his son, whose bid for a state legislative seat last
month was marked by widespread violence and at least 13 deaths.
   ``There were no conditions attached to the withdrawal and this
is a result of positive approach by senior (party) leaders,'' Patel
said.
   Devi Lal, 75, was the chief minister, or top elected official,
of Haryana state before resigning to join the federal Cabinet. His
son, Om Prakash Chautala, was appointed to succeed him as chief
minister of the predominantly agricultural state adjacent to New
Delhi.
   Under Indian law, Chautala had to win an election to the Haryana
state assembly within six months to keep the chief minister's job.
Chautala ran on a Janata Dal ticket in a Feb. 27 by-election that
subsequently was countermanded because of the violence and
widespread allegations of vote-rigging by Chautala's supporters in
the Meham constituency.
   Amid newspaper condemnations of Chautala's election tactics,
federal Industries Minister Ajit Singh visited the Meham district
and demanded Chautala resign as chief minister on ``moral grounds.''
   Ajit Singh, who is unrelated to the prime minister, is a strong
rival of Devi Lal within the Janata Dal party.
   The Janata Dal has been marked by almost continuous internal
bickering since its founding in 1988, and the latest flap prompted
a weekend flurry of consultations within the party.
   A semblance of unity is crucial for the Janata Dal, since it
attained national leadership with a minority government.
   Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party took the
most votes of any single party in the November national elections,
but the 192 parliamentary seats it captured fell far short of the
263 needed to form a majority.
   The National Front coalition, in which the Janata Dal is the
major component, won only 144 seats. But unlike the Congress Party,
it was able to muster the tacit support of right-wing and left-wing
parties and form a government in December. An outright split within
the Janata Dal could topple V.P. Singh from the prime minister's
job.

   About 3,000 university students
demonstrated in heavy rain today to demand that the elderly
politicians who dominate Taiwan's electoral college step down and
be replaced by direct presidential elections.
   The protest came two days before the electoral college meets to
select the next president. The only candidate is President Lee
Teng-hui of the ruling Nationalist Party.
   The students boycotted classes from about a dozen universities
to participate in the first major student demonstration since
Taiwan lifted martial law in 1987 after 38 years.
   Wearing yellow headbands, they linked arms and sang ``United We
Have Strength, As Students We Have Strength.'' They met in the
Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Park, named after the strongman
Nationalist leader who moved his government to Taiwan after losing
a civil war to Communist forces on the Chinese mainland in 1949.
There was little police presence at the park.
   Several hundred students vowed to continue their pro-democracy
demonstration until after the presidential election and a dozen
classmates began a three-day hunger strike to demand reforms.
   A student circular demanded the dissolution of the 752-seat
electoral college, known as the National Assembly, which is
dominated by elderly Nationalist politicians elected in mainland
China before 1949.
   The deputies, many in their 80s and 90s, were frozen in office
to support the ruling Nationalist Party's claim to still be the
sole legitimate ruler of all of China.
   The students rejected a call by Lee to end their occupation of
the park, which started Friday when 200 students began a sit-in.
   Education Minister Mao Kao-wen arrived at the park before dawn
with a letter from Lee asking the students staging the sit-in to
return home.
   ``I know well what you are concerned about,'' Lee said in the
letter. ``I assure you that the government will give you specific
answers soon.''
   The students said they were disappointed at the vague promise
and want Lee to present a specific timetable for democratic change.
   Almost all of Taiwan's 20 million people are ethnic Chinese and
last spring's Beijing student movement received wide sympathy here.
   ``If people in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and Beijing dare
to demand reforms, so do we,'' said a poster at the site of the
park sit-in.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Hear Appeal of Antitrust Settlement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to hear
appeals stemming from a $200 million settlement of price-fixing
charges against the nation's leading manufacturers of folding
cartons.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that
redistributed a $6 million surplus from the settlement in one of
the biggest antitrust cases ever.
   The manufacturers were accused of criminal antitrust violations
in 1975 by the Justice Department.
   In the wake of that successful prosecution, the manufacturers
were sued by 2,700 customers. That suit was settled in 1979 when a
$200 million fund was created to pay off all claims.
   In an unusual twist, some $6 million was left over in unclaimed
money _ triggering a decade-long battle that led to the appeals
acted on today.
   Two federal judges in Illinois, Hubert L. Will and the late
Edwin A. Robson, ordered creation of a foundation to spend the
surplus for research on complex antitrust and class-action lawsuits.
   But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1984 overruled the
judges' order, calling it a ``miscarriage of justice and an abuse
of discretion.''
   The appeals court instead ordered the money turned over to the
federal government.
   But before the order was carried out, the manufacturers and
their customers worked out a new agreement that would let law
schools apply for some of the funds. Judges Will and Robson
approved that agreement.
   Loyola University in Chicago was awarded $1.2 million and the
University of Chicago $156,000.
   The 7th Circuit court, acting on an appeal by the federal
government, ruled in 1989 that the universities must return the
money.
   The appeals court then sent the case to another federal judge to
come up with a new solution for distributing the excess money.
   The appeals court suggested the money be distributed on a
nationwide basis _ perhaps by giving it to the Federal Judicial
Center Foundation that helps educate and train court personnel and
does research to improve the federal courts.
   The appeals court ruling was challenged in separate appeals by
Will and the customers who sued the folding carton manufacturers.
   In a third appeal, a committee Will and Robson appointed to
distribute the surplus funds asked the high court to award it
lawyer fees denied by the 7th Circuit court.
   Bush administration lawyers, in yet another appeal, said the
high court should not disturb the appeals court ruling. If the
justices agreed to review the case, the government appeal said,
they should consider giving the surplus money to the federal
government.
   The cases are In Re Will, 89-927; In Re Folding Carton
Litigation, 89-992; Folding Carton Administration Committee vs.
Folding Carton Reserve Fund, 89-1081; and U.S. vs. Folding Carton
Reserve Fund., 89-1097.

<HEAD>Guam Governor Signs Most Restricted Abortion Law in U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AGANA, Guam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Joseph F. Ada today signed into law a
bill containing the most restrictive abortion legislation in the
United States, and opponents pledged to fight to measure all the
way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``The question for me really boils down to one simple point,''
Ada said. ``In my heart, I believe a fetus is a human being.''
   The law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers
the life of the mother. The law makes it a third-degree felony to
perform an abortion or aid in the procedure, a misdemeanor for a
woman to solicit or have an abortion and a misdemeanor for a person
to solicit a woman to have an abortion.
   Although the bill is now law, it contains a clause calling for a
referendum on abortion during the Nov. 6 general election, allowing
voters to decide whether they want to retain the law.
   Ada signed the bill before a room packed with dozens of abortion
rights supporters and opponents.
   ``My personal views on the subject of abortion have been stated
many times and should be, by now, fairly well known,'' Ada said.
``I do not agree with the practice of abortion, except in the case
of rape, incest and where the life of the mother may be
threatened.''
   ``It was outrageous that the bill was signed,'' said Janet
Benshoof, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's
Reproductive Freedom Project, based in New York.
   Benshoof arrived Sunday in this U.S. territory in the western
Pacific Ocean, hoping to meet with Ada to discuss the implications
of the bill. The meeting never took place.
   ``I was devastated he was making a personal opinion,'' Benshoof
said. ``We all have a conscience. I believe he should be making the
decision for the people of Guam.''
   Benshoof said she will remain on Guam for ``as long as it
takes'' and said she has no immediate plans to return to New York.
   The unicameral Guam Legislature unanimously approved the bill
March 8 despite an opinion from Attorney General Elizabeth
Barrett-Anderson that it is unconstitutional.
   It was amended before approval to provide the public referendum
on the abortion issue.
   The vote came after Archbishop Anthony Apuron threatened to
excommunicate any Roman Catholic senator who voted against the
measure. All but one of the 21 senators are Catholic, as is Ada.
However, not all senators were aware of Apuron's threat before the
vote.
   Rachael Pine, staff attorney for the ACLU's Reproductive Freedom
Project, had said the Guam law, if approved, would give the U.S.
Supreme Court the opportunity to decide the core issue of the right
to abortion.
   In a letter sent to Ada before the signing, Benshoof said the
case would be ultimately appealed to the Supreme Court.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Prison Overcrowding Appeal From Puerto Rico</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
Puerto Rico officials fined more than $30 million for failing to
move quickly enough to relieve prison overcrowding.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that the
commonwealth's belated efforts to ease the problem is not reason
enough to cancel the fines.
   Officials from 31 states joined in urging the justices to hear
the commonwealth's appeal.
   The states are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Delaware,
Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New
Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia
and Wyoming.
   State officials said strict enforcement of such federal court
penalties could delay voluntary prison reforms.
   The Puerto Rico case stems from a 1979 lawsuit by inmates. A
federal judge ruled the following year that each prisoner must be
provided at least 35 square feet of cell space temporarily, and
ultimately 55 square feet in dormitories and 70 square feet in
individual cells.
   Commonwealth officials in 1986 agreed to comply with the court
order and began to expand prison capacity.
   But in July 1987 the officials were fined $50,000 plus $10 per
day per inmate for failing to provide 35 square feet of space per
prisoner. The fines were increased in August 1988 so that by
November 1989 they approached a total of $30 million.
   Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon and other officials said tropical
rains and an unexpected increase in the prison population prevented
them from meeting their own deadlines for easing overcrowding.
   They said they inherited the problem from a previous
administration, and had more than tripled the commonwealth's prison
budget. Prison capacity was increased from 5,400 in 1985 to 10,295
last year, they said.
   But the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the fines last
September.
   ``The relevant harm, confinement in an area smaller than five by
seven feet, is significant,'' the appeals court said. ``The number
of prisoners suffering that harm, seven to 10 percent, is large.
And the time since entry of the remedial decree is long.''
   The appeals court said officials have not shown that meeting
their own deadline for providing the minimum space was
``overwhelmingly difficult or anywhere near impossible.''
   The appeals court added that U.S. District Court Judge Juan M.
Perez-Giminez, who has presided over the case, could decide to use
the fines to pay for prison expansion.
   Puerto Rico officials said if other appeals courts adopted the
1st Circuit court's approach it could mean that states and the
federal government would have to pay billions of dollars a year in
fines for failing to expand prisons quickly enough.
   The states that supported Puerto Rico's appeal said nearly every
state in the nation is under a court order to improve prison
conditions.
   The case is Hernandez Colon vs. Feliciano, 89-1016.

<HEAD>Students Undergoing Military Training Rave About the Experience</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLENE L. FU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beijing University's freshmen class, ordered to
undergo a year of military training after last year's pro-democracy
uprising, wrote glowingly of the experience in a letter published
today.
   ``Your visit and that of other leading officers helped us to
better understand that our military training certainly is not the
`punishment' that others have said,'' the students wrote to the
education minister.
   ``Rather it indeed shows the preferential treatment ... the
solicitude and loving care given to our generation of college
students,'' they said.
   The letter was published on the front page of the Communist
Party newspaper, the People's Daily, less than three weeks before
the anniversary of the start of the student-led pro-democracy
movement.
   Its publication also coincided with the convening this week of
the annual session of China's parliament, the National People's
Congress.
   The lengthy letter to Education Minister Li Tieying was written
Jan. 14. Last year, as part of the crackdown on dissent following
the spring protests, the government cut the incoming freshmen class
at all major universities.
   At Beijing University, the freshmen class was ordered to undergo
a year of military training before starting their course work. The
university's students were among the leaders of the 1989 movement.
   The approximately 700 students were sent to train at an army
base in Shijiazhuang, about 185 miles south of Beijing. Reporters
were not allowed to visit the site.
   Sources on Beijing university campuses said they did not expect
any activities to mark last year's uprising, which was crushed by
the military in June.
   ``Everyone wants there to be trouble, but no one wants to be the
one to start it,'' said one Beijing University student.
   But the school's freshman class adopted a very different tone in
its letter.
   ``Finally we understand ... that although last April and May our
nation experienced very serious turmoil and although the
international situation is changing unpredictably, the great flag
of socialism will never fall,'' they wrote.
   The students said the masses would never stand for the overthrow
of socialism because they are the ones who would suffer the most.
   The letter gave few details about the students' living
conditions and training but boasted about their ``harvest'' of new
political awareness.
   They have become living examples of the Chinese socialist maxim
of ``serving the people,'' the students said. They said they had
learned that ``without the People's Army the people would have
nothing,'' and vowed to ``train ourselves into a new model of
socialist college students.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to hear a Bush
administration appeal aimed at making it costlier for an
organization called the National Security Archive to compile
information.
   The archive is a non-profit organization that collects
information on national security and foreign policy and makes it
available to the public in various ways.
   It has filed thousands of FOIA requests for government records.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that gives the
archive the same preferential status under the Freedom of
Information Act that other news media enjoy.
   The administration claimed the archive should not have the
status of a news organization for purposes of FOIA requests.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last year that the
archive should be treated as a news media representative under the
FOIA because it publishes some of the information it gathers itself.
   News media representatives that make FOIA requests reimburse the
government for the cost of copying the documents, but not for the
major additional cost of searching for the records. If the archive
did not have the status of a news organization, it would have to
reimburse the government for search costs.
   The archive is headed by Scott Armstrong, a former Washington
Post reporter and co-author of ``The Brethren,'' a 1979 book that
provided a behind-the-scenes look at the Supreme Court.
   The organization published a book entitled ``The Chronology: The
Documented Day-by-Day Account of the Secret Military Assistance to
Iran and the Contras'' and another called ``El Salvador _ The
Making of U.S. Policy, 1977-1984.''
   A federal judge ruled in favor of the Pentagon when it sought to
force the archive to pay more for government documents.
   In reversing that decision, the appeals court here said,
``Congress intended that an organization like the archive qualify
as a representative of the news media.''
   The appeals court added, however, ``If the archive's intention
to publish works derived from the documents it requests does not
pan out, it will be open to the Department of Defense to argue that
the archive is no longer a representative of the news media.''
   The case is U.S. vs. National Security Archive, 89-1204.

   Police arrested a Dallas County commissioner who
whitewashed a billboard depicting a black woman as part of a
protest against cigarette and alcohol advertising aimed at black
consumers.
   Commissioner John Wiley Price was released Sunday from Lew
Sterrett Justice Center after paying $52 of a $200 bond. He was
arrested two hours earlier on a charge of criminal mischief over
$400, a class A misdemeanor.
   ``We are the target of adverse advertising. We are the
victims,'' said Price, who is black.
   He led two dozen people who whitewashed between 25 and 30
billboards Sunday. All the billboards contained advertising for
alcohol or tobacco products.
   ``I didn't paint but one sign, but I was the only one
arrested,'' Price said. Police confirmed that Price was the only
person arrested in the protest.
   While he was handcuffed in front of several dozen people at the
gates to Fair Park, Price said he would continue to do ``whatever
it takes'' to stop tobacco and alcohol advertising targeted at
minorities.
   ``We'll be back out again next Sunday,'' he said.
   Last week, similar demonstrations took place in New York,
Chicago and Detroit.
   George Reynolds, president of the Dallas Outdoor Advertising
Association, said sign owners and advertisers were upset by the
action because they had been asked by minorities in the past to use
minority models in their ads and were now criticized for putting up
the billboards at all.
   ``We can't win either way,'' Reynolds said.

<TEXT>
   A conservative alliance that favors speedy
unification with West Germany today proposed a broad coalition
government after being swept to a surprise victory in East
Germany's first free elections.
   But one of the parties invited to join the Cabinet immediately
refused, making it much more difficult for the conservatives to
achieve a two-thirds majority in Parliament. Such a majority would
allow Parliament to simply declare a merger with the West.
   Sunday's vote culminated a peaceful democratic revolution that
toppled hard-line Communists five months ago. About 93 percent of
the 12.2 million eligible voters cast ballots, and the results
reflected sentiment that the faster East Germany is joined with its
prosperous neighbor, the better.
   Lothar de Maiziere, who is likely to become premier, said today
the remainder of the Berlin Wall must be torn down ``as soon as
possible as a clear sign of the merging of the two German states.''
   De Maiziere, chairman of the top-ranking Christian Democratic
Party, also said in a post-election news conference that talks with
the West German government on monetary, economic and social union
must be accelerated.
   The Christian Democrats received more votes than any party in
Sunday's election. They are the leading party in the three-party
Alliance for Germany, which won 48.2 percent of the vote and 193 of
the 400 parliamentary seats. That was more than pre-election polls
predicted.
   The vote marked the first time East Germans were given a free
choice at polls after a decade of the Nazis and 41 years of
Communist dictatorship.
   De Maiziere, reading a statement by the alliance, said the group
``wanted to build a possible grand coalition.''
   ``Therefore, we are inviting the Social Democrats and the Union
of Free Democrats to coalition talks,'' he said.
   Social Democratic leader Ibrahim Boehme said his party, which
favors reunification at a slower pace than the alliance, had
decided against entering a coalition with the conservatives.
   The Social Democrats were early pre-election favorites but fell
behind in polls after the alliance received massive backing from
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Like the alliance, Kohl
supports speedy unification.
   The Social Democrats placed a distant second, with 21.8 percent
and 87 seats. The Union of Free Democrats, a centrist party that
also supports slower reunification, won 5.3 percent, or 21 seats.
   Boehme said the Social Democrats had also decided against
entering a coalition with the communist party, which sought their
support to prevent conservatives from achieving the two-thirds
parliamentry majority.
   The Communists, who ruled the nation with an iron fist before
being toppled in October, won 16.3 percent of the votes and 65
seats. The party, renamed the Party of Democratic Socialism,
cautioned that rapid reunification would hurt East Germany.
   The rest of the vote was divided among 20 smaller parties and
groupings, including such diverse contenders as the Beer Drinkers'
Party. It won just .02 percent of the vote, not enough to have a
seat in parliament.
   Interestingly, the vanguard of the pro-democracy revolution that
made the election possible fared poorly. New Forum, in an alliance
with two other groups, ended with just 2.9 percent of the vote. It
will have 12 seats in Parliament.
   The United States and Britain praised the orderly election. The
campaigning was harsh, but no irregularities were reported in
voting.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called the election a new
beginning for East Germany and another step in the spread of
democracy through central and eastern Europe.
   The White House called it a ``historic occasion.'' There was no
immediate comment from Washington on the final results.
   According to East German law, the new parliament must constitute
itself within 30 days of the election.
   The new government will take part in unification talks with West
Germany and the four World War II Allies _ Britain, France, the
Soviet Union, and the United States.
   A major issue is the military strength and alignment of a
unified Germany. The Western powers want West Germany to remain
part of the NATO military alliance. The Soviets and East German
Communists have called for a neutral single state.
   Citing the outcome, Kohl and de Maiziere urged East Germans to
halt the exodus to West Germany, which sparked the fall uprising
but has crippled the East's economy and put enormous strains on the
West.
   ``The German citizens have decided against every form of
extremism,'' Kohl told a news conference. ``Most important, they
want to follow a path, together with West Germany, that will lead
to unification.''
   ``My message at this hour is: Stay home,'' Kohl said. ``Work
with us in your villages, cities and communities, in your factories
and in your local administrations to build up this beautiful
country.''
   As one way of persuading people to stay in East Germany, the
countries are negotiating a monetary union in which West Germany's
powerful mark would become East Germany's currency as well.
   In an interview with the Cologne newspaper Express, de Maiziere
raised the prospects of the two German states forming their planned
monetary union ``perhaps as early as June.''
   As the results poured in Sunday night, about 2,000 ecstatic
supporters of the Christian Democrats gathered at a victory party
and chanted ``Helmut! Helmut!''
   Germans from both sides of the border turned the decaying
industrial town of Eisensach into a symbol of unity, celebrating
the East German elections as the prelude to a merger.
   Erhardt Jung, a 35-year-old metal worker, said he voted for the
Christian Democrats because the party has drawn the clearest and
quickest line for unification.
   ``I'm looking forward to a true free market here,'' he said.
``The central economy was a farce. It has to go forwards from here:
unification as quickly as possible.''

   Teachers throughout West Virginia
returned to their classrooms today after voting overwhelmingly to
end an 11-day strike.
   ``They're back,'' said Jackie Goodwin, a spokeswoman for the
16,000-member West Virginia Education Association, the main
teachers union in the state.
   Unions in 43 of the state's 55 counties voted by large
majorities Sunday or early today to accept a back-to-school
agreement reached by union leaders and state legislative leaders on
Saturday.
   ``We've made our point. We won a lot of respect, unity and
strength through this,'' Goodwin said. ``The teachers have shown
they mean business.''
   In Morgantown, school started an hour later than usual at North
Elementary School to allow teachers time to prepare for their
pupils who seemed happy to be back.
   ``I feel good,'' said Jorja Smith, a counselor at the school.
``We made the public aware of the problems the schools were having
and the problems we were having with the governor.''
   Teachers in two counties, Jackson and Greenbrier, voted to
return before the settlement was announced.
   Marion County teachers voted to ``suspend'' rather than settle
their strike, pending the outcome of a special session promised by
legislative leaders.
   ``If the Legislature doesn't come through with what we want,
we're back out,'' said Kathy Jacquez, president of the Marion
County Education Association.
   Teachers, upset over the state's refusal to grant pay raises,
walked out March 7. Educators in just nine of the state's 55
counties voted not to support the strike.
   On Saturday, legislative leaders promised leaders of the state's
two teachers unions they would ask Gov. Gaston Caperton to call a
special session to address long-term education needs.
   The settlement does not specifically address salaries _ which,
averaging $21,904 in 1988-89, were ranked nearly last among the 50
states _ but calls for lawmakers and union leaders to work out a
plan for improved pay and benefits.
   ``That's all we ever wanted, an education summit to get
something done so we don't have to keep going to Charleston banging
our heads against the House and Senate doors,'' said Joseph
Suriano, president of the Ohio County Education Association.
   ``I think we've done a heck of a job,'' said Marie Hamrick,
president of the Raleigh County Education Association.
   ``We're glad to be going back to our schools,'' she said. ``Of
course, there are some people who are going to be unhappy unless we
have $5,000 across the board and Gaston hanging from a pole.''
   Caperton's proposals to teachers were either withdrawn by the
administration or were rejected by the education association and
the 3,000-member West Virginia Federation of Teachers.
   Both unions endorsed Caperton in his bid for governor in 1988.
However, union representatives say Caperton has lost his
credibility and teachers will have more faith in promises of action
made by House Speaker Chuck Chambers and Senate President Keith
Burdette.
   Teachers ``would much rather trust the legislators than Governor
Caperton,'' said Janet Zevnik, president of the Tyler County
Education Association. ``We have tried three times to negotiate
with Governor Caperton and three times he has let us down.''
   Caperton and legislative leaders offered teachers a 5 percent
raise before the strike began, but the offer was dropped when the
WVEA continued to threaten a walkout.
   The WVEA rejected a second offer, saying the governor reneged on
a promise to call a special session. The third offer fell through
when the unions rejected a seven-point plan from Caperton they said
contained nothing new.
   WVFT Executive Director Bob Brown said the tentative settlement
reached Saturday is better than the previous offers because
lawmakers agreed to work out a plan to raise revenue for salaries
by next fall.

   A U.S. Air Force F4-G Phantom jet
fighter taking part in joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises
crashed south of Seoul today but the two crewmen aboard ejected
safely, authorities said.
   The jet from Clark Air Base in the Philippines crashed near
Chongju, 60 miles south of Seoul, shortly after 1 p.m., U.S.
military officials said.
   The pilot and weapon systems officer on board the aircraft
ejected safely but were admitted to a military hospital for
checkup, it said.
   The announcement did not identify the crewmen. Military
officials were investigating the cause of the accident.
   The South Korean news agency, Yonhap, said the jet exploded
after crashing into a mountainside near a reservoir. About 200 pine
trees in the area were burned in a fire that followed the
explosion, it said.
   It was the second accident involving U.S. military aircraft in
this year's joint U.S.-South Korea ``Team Spirit'' exercises under
way since last week.
   On Thursday, a U.S. army helicopter on a night flying mission
crashed after hitting a power line south of Seoul. No one was
killed.
   About 190,000 U.S. and South Korean troops are taking part in
this year's ``Team Spirit'' exercises. The maneuvers have been held
annually since 1976.

   Sikh extremists fighting for secession of
Punjab state raided a farm and fatally shot five members of a
family accused of being police informers, police said today.
   Elsewhere in Punjab state, Sikh militants killed 21 people in a
24-hour period that ended today, according to police and news
reports.
   Two militants barged into a farm in Guru-ka-Khu village late
Sunday and started shooting in the courtyard, killing the owner,
Mahenderpal Singh, his three sons and a brother-in-law, a senior
police officer, R.P. Singh said.
   A note claiming responsibility for the killings was found near
the bodies, Singh said. The note was signed by a group called
Khalistan Commando Force, one of several militant organizations
fighting to set up an independent nation in Punjab, he said.
   The militants call the proposed nation ``Khalistan,'' or the
Land of the Pure.
   Gunmen crouching in trenches dug along a road near the Punjab
town of Talwandi halted three trucks early today and opened fire on
the drivers and passengers, police said. Senior Police
Superintendent Surjit Singh initially put the death toll at 11, but
United News of India later reported it was 14.
   Talwandi is about 45 miles south of Amritsar, the holiest Sikh
city and the center of the 8-year-old campaign for secession from
Hindu-dominated India.
   Other police officials said militants killed a Sikh clergyman,
his bodyguard and a relative Sunday in Faridkot district. Police
did not say why they were killed but the extremists are known to
attack fellow Sikhs who do not support their cause.
   The officials also said on condition of anonymity that a Hindu
politician and a Sikh farmer were gunned down by extremists Sunday
night in separate shootings. Details of the other deaths were not
given.
   The latest deaths brought to 397 the number of people killed
this year by Sikh militants in their quest for Khalistan. The
separatists claim the Hindu- dominated government discriminates
against them.
   Sikhs are a slight majority in Punjab, a rich farming state
bordering Pakistan. Natiowide, Sikhs comprise 2 percent of India's
880 million population while Hindus account for 82 percent.

<HEAD>Court to Decide if Anti-Counterfeiting Law Can Be Used in Phony
Mileage Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether a federal anti-counterfeiting law may be used to crack down
on the sale of used cars with phony mileage readings.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by the manager of a
Pennsylvania car dealership sentenced under the law to six months
in prison.
   The manager, Raymond J. Moskal, was convicted last year of
taking part in a scheme in which car odometers were turned back and
ownership titles listing the lower mileages were obtained in
Virginia.
   Also convicted were Al Davis, owner of the wholesale car
dealership in Manheim, Pa., where Moskal worked, and Dennis Smith,
owner of a dealership in Chesapeake, Va.
   Davis and Smith did not appeal to the Supreme Court.
   All three were convicted under a federal law that makes it a
crime to transport falsely made securities across state lines or to
make counterfeit state securities.
   Prosecutors said the ownership certificates from Davis'
dealership were shipped to contacts in Virginia who applied for
titles in that state with the phony lower mileage figures.
   The Virginia titles then were sent back to Davis and he
distributed them to area dealers to sell with the used cars.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the convictions of
the thee defendants.
   The appeals court said a bonafide car title issued by a state
qualifies as a falsely made security when the title contains false
information.
   ``Stated mileage is a material part of a title certificate,''
the appeals court said. ``The fact that valid title is transferred
by the certificate does not vitiate the fraud that is foisted on
the unsuspecting customer when the falsely made document is
introduced into commerce.''
   Federal appeals courts elsewhere in the nation have disagreed
with the 3rd Circuit court's interpretation.
   The Justice Department urged the high court to resolve the
conflict. The department said the court should intercede to
``promote the fair and efficient operation of the federal criminal
justice system.''
   The case is Moskal vs. U.S., 89-964.

   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel arrived today
for talks with French leaders on the future shape of a Europe
quickly shedding distinctions between East and West.
   ``I'm persuaded that we will understand each other,'' Havel told
President Francois Mitterrand after landing at Orly Airport.
   The two-day trip is the playwright-turned-president's first to
France since becoming Czechoslovakia's leader in December after the
breakdown of four decades of Communist rule.
   Havel predicted that his talks with Mitterrand this afternoon
and again at a state dinner would be ``intensive,'' covering
bilateral relations and ``the accelerating course of history.''
   In an interview published in the Sunday edition of the newspaper
Le Monde, Havel expressed support for Mitterrand's concept of a new
European security order involving the 35 countries that signed the
1975 Helsinki accords.
   ``At the end of the trail, we will see a new Europe as President
Mitterrand imagines,'' Havel was quoted as saying. ``It's
necessary, however, to look at intermediate steps that will permit
us to reach this ideal.''
   Havel rejected neutrality for a unified Germany and envisioned a
common European security system free of both the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact.
   ``The future European system shoud be founded on the principle
of multipolarity ... a system where the Lithuanians and the Irish,
as well as the Germans and the French, will feel secure,'' Havel
said.

   Military police guarded against looters today
in flood-ravaged southern Alabama, where a weekend of sunny weather
did little to diminish the devastation from two days of torrential
rains.
   The deluge and flooding killed 10 and left at least 3,700 people
homeless in Alabama, and the town of Elba remained a muddy hole two
days after an earthen levee ruptured along the Pea River.
   More than 150 Alabama National Guard police patrolled the town
to enforce curfews and guard against looting in the devastated
business district. Spokesman Maj. David Bosarge said that in all,
about 300 guardsmen were dispatched to 24 locations in southeast
Alabama to assist with flood control, evacuations and security.
   Water from nearly non-stop rain Thursday and Friday also swelled
rivers and streams in Georgia, where authorities blamed flooding
for four deaths in auto accidents.
   Some Alabama rivers were expected to crest at 20 feet or more
above flood level today or Tuesday, while some rivers in southern
Georgia were not expected to crest until Friday, the National
Weather Service said.
   After a sunny, dry weekend, temperatures dropped. The National
Weather Service warned that a new storm front would bring freezing
temperatures and possibly snow to Alabama's northern tip and
near-freezing temperatures and light rain to south Alabama.
   Though the Pea River was one of the few starting to recede in
the state Sunday, water still nipped at Elba's downtown rooftops,
1,500 of the 4,400 residents were homeless and roads, homes,
schools and businesses were paralyzed. As much as 16 inches of rain
fell in southern Alabama last week.
   Elba Mayor Fred Moore estimated the cleanup would cost millions
of dollars.
   ``I've never seen anything like it,'' said U.S. Rep. Bill
Dickinson, who toured the devastated area by helicopter Sunday. ``I
cannot begin to imagine everything that's been lost or damaged.''
   Most southern Alabama rivers continued rising today as flood
waters drained toward the Gulf of Mexico, a National Weather
Service official said.
   Authorities reported about 500 people were forced from their
homes in the Montgomery area as the muddy Alabama River rose to 19
feet above flood stage.
   In Selma, about 200 people fled their homes as the river headed
toward the level reached in a record 1961 flood. Hundreds more
could be evacuated by Tuesday afternoon, when the river is expected
to crest 13 feet above flood level, said emergency management
director Warren Rhoades.
   The Choctawhatchee River was 21 feet above flood stage in the
southeast Alabama town of Newton, about 30 miles east of Elba.
Sheriff's deputies said some 500 people had been forced from their
homes since Friday in Newton and surrounding Dale County.
   Evacuations in five other counties brought the total number of
evacuations to more than 3,700, authorities said.
   The waters in Elba appeared to have receded perhaps a foot or
two on Sunday, but a swift current continued to flow swiftly
through a 100-foot hole on the north side of the levee and back
into the Pea River through a large crack on the south side.
   The water was up to the windows of Lela Wilson's one-story home,
which she moved into about a week ago.
   ``It hurts. It honestly hurts. It seems like everything you work
for you wind up losing,'' she said.
   For older Elba residents, the deluge brought back memories of a
``great flood'' that devastated the town on March 14, 1929.
   Fleetwood Carnley, 71, recalled that his family had to seek
refuge in their loft. But now, their home is submerged.
   ``We didn't get anything out but what we wore,'' Carnley said.
``I just couldn't conceive it happening.''
   Col. Larry Bonine, the district engineer for the Army Corps of
Engineers in Mobile, said it was too early to determine what caused
the levee to rupture.
   About 45 miles downstream in Geneva, emergency workers shored up
another levee and continued evacuating residents. At least 450
people were forced out there.
   Margaret Mixon, emergency management director for Geneva County,
said officials believed the Geneva levee would hold.
   But she added, ``I guess Elba was pretty confident, too.''
   State troopers said six people drowned Friday night in Covington
County when a car fell into a rain-swollen creek where a bridge had
washed out.
   Two more people met a similar fate Saturday night in neighboring
Escambia County, and a third man died there when he walked into a
flooded area to check on his parents.
   Another man was found dead in his car in Prichard on Sunday
morning on a road that had been barricaded since Friday due to
7-foot-deep water, police said.
   In Georgia, authorities expected the Ocmulgee River to crest at
12 feet above flood level today in Macon. The Flint River is
expected to crest at about 11 feet above flood level by Friday in
Albany.
   The Georgia State Patrol blamed the heavy rain and floods for
car crashes that killed three people near Lumpkin on Saturday and
one woman in Henry County late Friday night.

<HEAD>India Boosts Defense Spending; Cites Pakistani Threat</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today announced a 10.5
percent increase in military spending and officials said the boost
was necessary due to growing tensions with Pakistan along a
disputed northwestern border.
   Finance Minister Madhu Dandavate presented the $9.3 billion
defense budget to parliament as part of the government's budget for
1990-91.
   ``This increase in defense expenditure is not of our choice,''
Dandavate said. ``It is a direct result of the situation on our
borders.''
   The hike in defense spending follows two months of fighting
between Moslem miliants and government troops in the northern
Jammu-Kashmir state where Moslems want to secede from predominantly
Hindu India.
   At least 184 people have been killed in the latest round of
violence that flared up Jan. 20 following a government crackdown.
   Pakistan controls the western part of Kashmir and has claimed
the larger Indian-controlled area because of its predominantly
Moslem population. Pakistan has openly pledged support for the
militants.
   The secession movement has been alternately simmering and
flaring since 1947 when the old princely state of Kashmir, then
governed by a Hindu ruler, opted to merge with India instead of
mostly Moslem Pakistan.
   Pakistan and India have fought three wars since independence.
   India, with a population of 880 million, has an armed force of
1.36 million men, smaller only than those of the Soviet Union,
China and the United States.
   The budget, the first by Prime Minister V.P. Singh's government,
which came to power 3{ months ago, calls for $55 billion in
spending and revenues of $51 billion.
   The budget calls for a debt of $4 billion.

<HEAD>One Brother Named in Drug Case Arrested in Bombing; Other Sought</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man described as having a
``soldier-of-fortune mentality'' was being sought today for
questioning in the bombing of a U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration office.
   Local, state and federal officials were hunting for Jeffrey A.
Matthews, 23, formerly named Jeff Ciganek, in connection with the
Saturday morning firebombing of the local DEA office.
   Matthews' brother, John Lewis Ciganek, 22, was arrested Sunday
morning in the Florida Keys for questioning in the same case.
   The bombing took place two days after the brothers were indicted
on two counts of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and a month after
federal drug agents told local sheriff's deputies that Matthews had
threatened DEA property during a drug investigation.
   The search for the brothers began when they were declared
fugitives after their indictment Thursday, but picked up after the
bombing.
   Ciganek was arrested in Tavernier, just south of Key Largo, on
the drug charges, Lee County Sheriff John McDougall said Sunday.
Florida Highway Patrol officers turned Ciganek over to FBI agents,
who returned him to the Lee County Jail.
   Earlier in the day, FBI agent Brian Kensel, a spokesman for the
FBI team leading the investigation into the bombing, said no
charges had been filed against Ciganek over the bombing.
   Kensel said the FBI wanted to question the brothers about the
bombing. But he declined to label them _ or anyone else _ as prime
suspects.
   The search for Matthews has involved officers of the FBI, the
Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, among other agencies.
   McDougall also summoned 50 deputies from six other Florida
counties to help provide protection for at least 13 prosecutors,
judges and law enforcement officials who took part in a joint task
force investigating and prosecuting drug dealers in the
southwestern Florida county.
   ``We're certainly prepared for a showdown with him,'' McDougall
said of Matthews. ``The ball is in his court now. If he wants to
surrender, that's fine. But if he wants to engage in other options,
we'll accommodate him.''
   McDougall described Matthews as elusive, saying he always has
been proud of the fact that nobody knew exactly where he lived.
   ``I think he has a fixation with being a Mafia don,'' the
sheriff said. ``He's into that neo-Nazi philosophic bent. He's into
that neo-Nazi-type, soldier-of-fortune mentality.''
   At the DEA office, an FBI forensic team continued searching
through the charred rubble and was expected to finish its
investigation at the site today, according to Kensel.
   The blast appeared to have been triggered by a pipe bomb that
ignited some kind of ``liquid accelerant,'' probably gasoline, he
said.
   No one was injured in the bombing, but the blast and resultant
fire destroyed the one-story building, causing damage estimated at
$4 million.
   Last month, DEA agents told sheriff's deputies that Matthews had
threatened to damage DEA property and cars, the Fort Myers
News-Press reported Sunday. That report was filed after a DEA
vehicle parked outside the office was vandalized Feb. 24.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Judges' Authority to Rule in Some Labor Disputes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide how
much authority federal judges have to rule in some labor disputes.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by two workers fired by a
Michigan company, Ring Screw Works.
   Arthur Groves was fired for allegedly excessive unexcused
absences from work. Bobby Evans was dismissed for allegedly
falsifying company records.
   Both men denied the charges but lost grievance complaints
against the company. They then sued the firm for firing them
without due cause in violation of the federal Labor Relations
Management Act.
   The United Automobile Workers Union joined the lawsuits on the
side of the employees.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year upheld a ruling
by a federal judge who threw out the suits.
   The appeals court said the UAW contract with Ring Screw Works
provides that a strike is the union's only recourse when workers
lose grievances. The appeals court said the only exception that
would permit the workers to sue would be if they accused the union
of breaching its duty to represent them fairly.
   The fired workers made no such accusation.
   The union members had voted against striking after Groves and
Evans lost their grievances.
   Groves, Evans and the UAW said in their appeals to the Supreme
Court that federal appeals courts elsewhere have disagreed with the
6th Circuit court and ruled that federal judges have authority to
rule in such suits. They asked the justices to resolve the conflict.
   The case is Groves vs. Ring Screw Works, 89-1166.

   Iranian hardliners have derailed moderates'
efforts for the release of Western hostages in the Mideast,
according to ABC News. But a senior Iranian official says prospects
for the hostages' release have never been better.
   Leaders of groups holding hostages in Lebanon were summoned to
Tehran for meetings last week, ABC's Pierre Salinger reported from
Paris on Sunday, quoting sources within the Hezbollah movement in
Lebanon.
   ``There, the current plan to release the hostages was sabotaged
by Iranian hardliners opposed to (Iranian President Hashemi)
Rafsanjani,'' Salinger reported.
   ``The hostage leaders returned to Lebanon three days ago and one
of the organizations, Islamic Jihad, issued a statement saying the
hostages wouldn't be released,'' he said. ``This position was
confirmed at a secret meeting in Lebanon 48 hours ago.'' The
statement mentioned by Salinger was issued by the Islamic Jihad for
the Liberation of Palestine.
   Spokeswoman Alixe Glen said there would be no White House
reaction to the report on Sunday.
   In an interview with Tehran Times newspaper in Iran on Sunday,
Ali Mohammad Besharati, first deputy foreign minister, said, ``I
can say that all the hostages may be released by 16.00-18.00.

   Two thieves with a talent for disguise and a taste
for Rembrandt and Degas stole 11 paintings valued at upwards of
$100 million in a daring theft from the Isabella Stewart Gardner
Museum.
   But experts say the paintings are so priceless, in one sense
they're worthless. Any legitimate collector or dealer would
recognize them and wouldn't pay a penny, they say.
   ``People make pilgrimages to see these paintings. Scholars and
art lovers know where they belong,'' Constance Lowenthal, executive
director of the International Foundation for Art Research, said
Sunday.
   The theft occurred around 1 a.m. Sunday, when two men apparently
convinced museum guards they were police, then bound them with tape
and made their way to the museum's Dutch room.
   It was seven hours before a cleaning crew discovered the theft.
   The heist was ``a professional job,'' said FBI agent Paul
Cavanagh. ``This is one of those thefts where people actually spent
some time researching and took specific things.''
   He said the investigation would not be limited to the United
States.
   ``It is the biggest Old Master theft in this country, by far,''
said Ms. Lowenthal, whose organization tracks art thefts.
   ``The Gardner Museum is a treasure house,'' she said.
``Everything in it is exceedingly valuable and first-rate and
superb.''
   The value of the missing works, which included an ancient
Chinese beaker, was in the hundreds of millions of dollars, said
Karen Haas, the museum's curator. The police report gave the value
as at least $100 million.
   ``It's not overstating the case to say that these are priceless
works,'' said William Robinson, curator of drawings for Harvard
University's Fogg Art Museum. ``A loss of any of these works is
significant.''
   But their true value cannot be determined because they have not
been on the market for nearly a century.
   The works taken were:
   _ ``The Concert'' by Jan Vermeer.
   _ ``A Lady and A Gentleman in Black,'' ``The Storm on the Sea of
Galilee,'' and a self-portrait by Rembrandt.
   _ ``Landscape with an Obelisk,'' by Govaert Flinck, another
17th-century Dutchman.
   _ ``Leaving the Paddock,'' ``Procession Outside Florence,''
``Three Mounted Jockeys,'' ``Program for an Artistic Soiree,'' and

   The Rembrandt self-portrait and ``The Storm on the Sea of
Galilee,'' the artist's only seascape, were especially important,
Robinson said.
   He said the theft of the Vermeer also was a major loss because
only about 35 of his works are known to exist.
   Experts said the motive for stealing such well-known pieces
could be ransom or acquisitiveness by a selfish, wealthy art lover.
   ``You hear legends of deranged collectors. But, mostly, I think
it's the stuff of spy novels,'' said Peter Sutton, curator of
European paintings at the nearby Museum of Fine Arts.
   Gardner Museum spokesman Corey Cronin refused to say whether the
works were insured.
   The Gardner Museum, which sits along the graceful green parkway
called the Fenway, has a state-of-the-art security system, and had
two security guards on duty at the time of the theft, Cronin said.
   He said no apparent damage was done to the museum, a four-story
building with a courtyard and a skylight.
   The museum was built to house the collection of the woman whose
name it bears, the widow of John Lowell Gardner, the wealthy son of
the last of Boston's East India merchants.
   Mrs. Gardner lived on the top floor of the mansion until her
death in 1924 at age 85. But she opened her home and its collection
to the public long before then, in 1903.
   The museum collection contains 290 paintings, 280 pieces of
sculpture and various religious objects, period furniture,
textiles, ceramics and documents and books by famous writers and
political figures.
   The last major reported theft involving a musuem occurred in
Paris on June 1, when a Georges Braque worth an estimated $3
million was taken from the National Museum of Modern Art at the
Pompidou Center.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Hear Tennessee Prosecutors' Appeal in Abuse Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to hear an
unusual appeal by Tennessee prosecutors in the case of a man
convicted of sexually abusing his 5-year-old nephew.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a Tennessee Supreme
Court ruling that upheld Sam Pilkey's 1986 conviction and 25-year
prison sentence.
   The state court ruled against Pilkey, who was 21 when he stood
trial, even though it found that his constitutional right to
confront all adverse witnesses was violated because jurors were
shown a videotaped statement by the young boy.
   Prosecutors introduced the videotape as evidence. The boy did
not testify in person, but apparently was available to be called by
Pilkey's lawyer for cross-examination. He was not.
   The state Supreme Court last August ruled that Pilkey's right
was violated but that the violation represented ``harmless error.''
   Even though Pilkey's conviction had been upheld, Tennessee
Attorney General Charles W. Burson appealed the state court's
ruling. He urged the justices to rule that showing the videotape
did not violate Pilkey's rights.
   The Supreme Court last January agreed to decide in cases from
Maryland and Idaho whether people accused of child abuse have the
right to at least one face-to-face confrontation with their young
accusers.
   A decision is expected by July.
   The case acted on today is Tennessee vs. Pilkey, 89-773.

Book Store</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
owners of a North Carolina adult film and book store who hired a
college professor to help them rebut obscenity charges.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that had the
effect of exposing the professor to an obscenity prosecution if he
surveyed people about their reactions to sexually explicit material.
   Cinema Blue of Charlotte, N.C., and its owners, Jim St. John and
Curtis Renee Peterson, were charged in 1988 with disseminating
obscenity. St. John and Peterson were convicted last year, and each
was sentenced to six years in prison. Their store was fined
$250,000.
   Prior to their trial, the two men hired Ohio State University
sociology professor Joseph E. Scott as an expert witness.
   Scott planned to show the allegedly obscene material to randomly
selected groups of adults in Mecklenburg County. He also planned to
conduct telephone surveys aimed at determining community attitudes
toward the material.
   The North Carolina obscenity law bans sexually explicit material
lacking ``serious literary, artistic, political or scientific
value'' if it also is ``patently offensive`` and ``appeals to the
prurient interest in sex'' as judged by contemporary community
standards.
   Peter S. Gilchrist III, the local district attorney, warned the
Cinema Blue owners that Scott could be prosecuted if he conductted
the surveys.
   A state judge refused to shield Scott from prosecution, and St.
John and Peterson turned to the federal courts for help.
   U.S. District Judge James B. McMillan ruled in their favor,
issuing an injunction that barred Gilchrist from prosecuting the
professor for conducting the surveys.
   But the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year overruled
the judge. ``In the unique circumstances present here,'' the
appeals court said, the judge should not have interfered in a
pending state prosecution.
   Scott ``was not immediately threatened with any irremediable
harm, for his remedy for avoiding state prosecution lay entirely
within his hands and could be invoked with no sacrifice of any
federal rights personal to him,'' the appeals court said.
   The appeals court also rejected charges that the adult book
store's proprietors were victims of unlawful discrimination by
Gilchrist. The store owners said Gilchrist permitted
anti-pornography groups and others to conduct surveys similar to
the one Scott wanted to undertake.
   The case is Cinema Blue vs. Gilchrist, 89-1213.

<HEAD>China's Legislature Meets Tuesday; No Controversy Expected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's national legislature meets Tuesday in an
annual session expected to be devoid of controversy and laden with
shows of loyalty to government political and economic policies.
   Unlike previous sessions of the National People's Congress, when
mild debate and scatterings of negative votes were taken as signs
of emerging democracy, the emphasis at the first meeting since the
June 1989 crackdown on demonstrators will be on political stability
and obedience.
   Wan Li, chairman of the Congress' Standing Committee, has called
on the nearly 3,000 deputies to the 15-day national meeting to
follow the guidance of the ruling Communist Party and ``make
correct policies'' for the good of all Chinese people.
   Communist Party members, who make up about two-thirds of the
delegates, reportedly have been told to refrain from making
controversial statements or proposals at the plenum.
   The Congress in recent years has tried to shake off its
rubber-stamp image by openly debating and sometimes amending
legislation, but the party still holds ultimate authority to
initiate and decide policy.
   Tuesday's highlight will be a state-of-the-nation address by
Premier Li Peng in which he is expected to hail the suppression of
the pro-democracy student movement and reassert China's commitment
to Communist Party rule and socialism.
   Li also will pledge to continue an austerity program that has
brought inflation under control, but may announce some concessions,
such as the easing of tight money policies, to pull the economy out
of a serious slump.
   Li, a political hard-liner and economic conservative, is
unlikely to reveal plans for new economic reforms. Instead of
market-oriented price reforms, now politically inexpedient, he may
call for tighter management of prices.
   On foreign policy matters, Li is expected to express China's
interest in good relations with all countries, including the Soviet
Union and the United States, but stress that China will not be
influenced by rapid changes in other socialist countries or bow to
U.S. Demands for human rights reforms.
   The deputies also will hear a report from the finance minister
on the government's precarious financial state and approve the 1990
budget.
   Attempts to balance the budget have been made more difficult by
intense competition for limited funds. Bureaucrats seeking money
for struggling education, social welfare and infrastructure
programs are vying with the military, which carries more clout
since the army put down the demonstrations and wants to reverse the
trend of falling defense budgets.
   The deputies are expected to pass with little debate a basic law
to govern Hong Kong after the British colony reverts to Chinese
rule in 1997, and an amendment to the joint venture law
guaranteeing that foreign enterprises in China will not be
nationalized.
   The Congress will approve several government personnel changes,
but the Standing Committee spokesman Yao Guang on Monday dampened
speculation about major displacements, including the removal of Li.
   The scheduled changes, he said, ``do not correspond with the
rumors and guesses and reports of some newspapers in Hong Kong,''
he said.
   Li is widely disliked because of his key role in the violent
military suppression of the pro-democracy movement and his economic
policies that have led to factory closures and unemployment. There
has been speculation the party would demote him to shore up its
shaky reputation among the populace.
   Hong Kong and foreign reports also have suggested the party
would have a non-party member named vice premier as part of its
recent pledges to give those outside the party a greater voice in
the government.
   Yao said the Congress would take up the request by senior leader
Deng Xiaoping to step down as chairman of the state Central
Military Commission. Deng, still regarded as the most powerful
person in China, resigned in November as head of the largely
overlapping party Central Military Commission, ending his official
party duties.
   Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin, who succeeded
Deng in the party post, is expected to get the state job as well.
   Yao said Jiang's predecessor Zhao Ziyang, who was purged form
all party posts in June for allegedly supporting the democracy
movement, would not attend the Congress.
   Zhao, a deputy from Sichuan province, has ``asked for leave,''
Yao said. He has not been seen in public since a tearful meeting
with hunger strikers on Tiananmen Square on May 19, 1989.

   NASA said today that its engineers have
worried for years that astronauts will have to spend too much time
in the harsh environment of open space to repair and maintain the
space station that is set for construction in the mid-90s.
   Agency officials were preparing a response to a front-page
article in the New York Times today that said the station can't be
built as designed ``because its vast array of parts would start to
break down before the station was completed.''
   The first elements of the $30 billion station are to be carried
into orbit beginning early in 1995 and completion is scheduled for
1999. The Times said NASA investigators found that construction
would be only 60 percent to 70 percent complete before preventive
maintenance would have to begin.
   The Times said investigators concluded that, if built according
to plan, the space station would have more than 5,500 external
parts that would need to be replaced if they failed. That would
require space walks, or what NASA calls EVAs, short for
extra-vehicular activity.
   ``In terms of the program addressing EVAs, that is not a new
thing; it's not a new problem that has suddenly been discovered,''
said space station spokesman Mark Hess.
   The Times said such space walks would total 2,200 hours for
maintenance, but Hess said that estimate includes a lot of time in
which astronauts would not actually be outside of the relative
safety of the station.
   Anther spokesman, James McCulla, said EVA time ``is a matter
that space station designers have been working on for years.''
   He said that working out methods to cut down the EVA time is an
integral part of design review activities ``and therefore will be
an important matter to be worked on for days to come.''

<HEAD>Counting the Homeless, A First-Time Effort</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Census Bureau workers will head for
flophouses, missions and cheap hotels Tuesday night. Then they'll
look for people in the streets and alleyways, and as the sun comes
up they'll be outside abandoned buildings to see who comes out.
   It will be the most ambitious effort ever to count the homeless
and the first in which the government tries to count people living
in the streets.
   ``The government needs to know about everyone and this is a
chance for the homeless to say, `Look, we exist, we're part of this
country,''' Cynthia Taeuber, special assistant for selected
populations at the Census Bureau, said Monday.
   Although most Americans will receive census forms asking from a
dozen to a few dozen questions, the main effort for the homeless
will be just to get them counted, explained Taeuber.
   The new effort reflects a change in American society, with the
homeless more numerous and more visible than ever.
   Dealing with the problem, though, has been muddled by the
scarcity of information on how many people have no homes. Estimates
have ranged from 250,000 to 3 million or more.
   Narrowing down that difference will involve an estimated 15,000
census workers and cost $2.7 million, Taeuber said.
   Census officials are looking for homeless in every city of at
least 50,000 people. In addition, Census asked smaller communities
if they had a homeless population and ``if they sent in the
information to us, we're there,'' said Taeuber.
   A decade ago the Census Bureau sent workers to flophouses and
shelters, and this special count is still known as S-Night.
Originally that stood for shelter night, now it's expanded to
shelter and street night.
   ``There are a lot of people that are homeless that don't even
come to a shelter. I stayed on the streets ... for days before I
came here,'' said Toylce Cheatham in a recent interview at a
Salvation Army shelter in Detroit.
   Workers will try to ask the homeless some questions. But they
will simply observe and estimate answers for those sleeping or who
are ``not in a state of mind to answer questions, or who refuse,''
Taeuber explained.
   Advocates for the homeless are cooperating with the census in
many cities, but a few are resisting the effort, claiming the count
will be too low.
   Because of problems in finding all the homeless, and concerns
about worker safety, Taeuber admits she expects the tally to be
conservative.
   But it will at least provide the first formal count of people in
the streets.
   In the end, however, the Census Bureau won't announce any
specific number of homeless, since officials decline to try and
define that term. Instead, the bureau will simply report that it's
special count found so many people in shelters, so many in
missions, so many in flophouses, so many walking or sleeping on the
streets, and so forth.
   Beginning Tuesday at 6 p.m. workers will visit public and
private emergency shelters, hotels and motels used to shelter the
homeless and other hotels costing less than $12 per night. This
effort is expected to last until about midnight, covering a period
when people are generally settled for the night.
   Then, from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. census workers will travel the
streets, checking places not intended for habitation but where
homeless people may be found. After that, until about 8 a.m.,
workers will be outside abandoned buildings where they believe some
homeless people may live.
   Michael Alakel, who said he has been homeless for three years in
Hartford, Conn., thinks census workers will have problems finding
people living in dumpsters, cars, graveyards and under bridges,
among other places.
   ``You have to know where to find these people. They are not
going to come out of their hiding places so they can be counted,''
said Alakel.
   Census officials concede they will miss some, but they have been
working with with municipal officials and local groups that assist
the homeless in order to identify the most likely places to look
during the special count.
   In New York City alone some 2,100 sites have been identified as
likely locations for the homeless, including more than 300 public
and private shelters.
   Security can be a problem for workers taking to streets and
shelters in the middle of the night, and they will be dispatched in
groups of two or three. They have been told to leave any area where
problems develop, said Taeuber.
   Because of safety questions, she explained, the decision was
made not to enter abandoned buildings even though people may be
sleeping in them.
   In Tompkins Square Park, on New York's lower east side, a
homeless man who declined to give his name said the early morning
hours are ``not a good time to ask people questions around here. I
think that's stupid.''

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl today vowed to
keep his promises of economic help to the East German people, a day
after his conservative East German allies were elected in their
nation's first free vote.
   Kohl also said he sees ``outstanding chances'' for his party
when elections for a united German government finally come, but he
doesn't expect that to happen until after West Germany's own
elections in December.
   During numerous campaign appearances in East Germany, Kohl
promised East Germans quick steps toward German unification, and to
protect them from possible economic and social shocks during the
process.
   Kohl told reporters he will not break his pledge.
   ``We will keep our promises to the people of the GDR (East
Germany),'' he said.
   Kohl campaigned vigorously for the three-party East German
alliance that placed first in Sunday's vote. West German newspapers
today heralded the results as a clear vote for quick unification.
   West Germany faces its own elections Dec. 2, and Social Democrat
Oskar Lafontaine today formally announced he would challenge Kohl.
   It has been assumed for weeks that Lafontaine, the sharp-tongued
governor of Saarland state, would enter the race.
   Like the leaders of their sister parties in East Germany,
Lafontaine and Kohl disagree on the pace and course of German
unification. Kohl wants it done quickly, but Lafontaine says it
must be a measured process and include creation of a new
constitution.
   Alfred Dregger, parliamentary chief of Kohl's Christian
Democrats, predicted in an interview with the Deutschlandfunk radio
station in Cologne that elections for a unified Germany would occur
next year.
   Dregger urged the newly elected allies in the East to undertake
economic and social reforms ``as soon as possible'' to lay the
groundwork for unification.
   The East German results could speed up negotiations between the
German states on making West Germany's mark East Germany's
currency. That would be a giant stride toward unification.
   The Alliance for Germany, however, did not win a majority and
must now build a coalition.
   Kohl said he had advised his East German allies to include the
East German Social Democrats in a ``grand coalition.'' However, the
leader of the East German Social Democrats today rejected such an
invitation.
   Kohl repeated his opinion that talks with East Germany on
creating a common currency should be taken up immediately after a
new government in East Berlin is created.
   The chancellor was asked when he foresaw all-German elections
taking place.
   He replied many steps should be taken first, such as East
Germany's local elections slated for May, and the reconstitution of
East Germany's states.
   Under Kohl's plans for unification, East German states could
join West Germany under a provision of the West German constitution.
   Kohl added, ``We'll have our federal elections in December in
any case, and then we'll see what happens.''

   The White House today hailed the free
elections held in East Germany and said the march toward a united
Germany is ``inexorable.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the strong showing
by the conservative alliance linked with West Germany Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's party also ``would seem to lend support'' for
U.S.-backed efforts to keep the new Germany inside NATO.
   ``We are pleased to note that East Germany yesterday joined the
growing list of nations that have held free and fair elections,''
Fitzwater said.
   ``This is a victory not only for the people of the German
Democratic Republic, but for all Germans and all who support
democratic values,'' he said in a statement. ``We have long
supported the aspirations of the people of East Germany in deciding
their own future. We join them and the people of the Federal
Republic in celebrating this historic occasion.''
   Asked about possible obstacles to unification, Fitzwater
replied, ``it does appear that the march towards reunification is
inexorable. It seems clear that the elections have sent that
message.''
   Asked if the large plurality for the Alliance for Germany, the
three-party conservative bloc tied to Kohl's Christian Democrats,
would make it easier to keep the new Germany within NATO, Fitzwater
said, ``I think that's difficult to say.''
   But he added, ``This victory ... would seem to lend support for
that direction as well.''
   He said, ``I don't think there's much question about their
intention.''
   The Soviet Union has said a united Germany cannot belong to the
Western military alliance.
   Bush and Kohl met at Camp David, Md., last month to discuss the
fast-moving changes leading to what could be a single Germany by
the end of this year. West Germans vote in their own parliamentary
elections this fall.
   The United States and the three other World War II victors, the
Soviet Union, Great Britain and France, have approved a process for
talks with the two Germanys on unification.
   Fitzwater said of unification, ``President Bush's discussions
with Chancellor Kohl all point in that direction and we have a
process in place now that hopefully will help manage that
reunification and make it a peaceful and orderly process.''
   The White House earlier had hailed the results of East Germany's
first free election in 57 years as a ``historic occasion.''
   White House deputy press secretary Alixe Glen, commenting on
Sunday after East Germans finished their balloting, said:
   ``The U.S. welcomes today's parliamentary elections in the
German Democratic Republic. We have long supported the aspirations
of the people of East Germany to decide their own future through a
freely elected parliament and government. We join them and the
people of the Federal Republic of Germany in celebrating this
historic occasion.''

   President Bush told attorneys general from
around the nation today that aggressive state efforts were
responsible in part for a ``certain turning around'' of public
opinion on drug abuse.
   But the state legal officers said what they really needed was
more money from Washington.
   Speaking at the White House to attorneys general from 37 states,
Bush cited some frustration that Congress hadn't moved more quickly
on parts of his drug and anti-crime package.
   ``We've gotten some of what we have asked for _ new agents, new
prosecutors, new prison space,'' he said. ``We are getting some
good support already on certain parts of the package. But I must
confess to a certain frustration.
   ``I would ask your support, this much horsepower in town, to
work ... with us on getting this crime package through.''
   He voiced strong opposition to efforts in Congress to
retroactively overturn state death sentences.
   ``We are not sympathetic to that,'' Bush said.
   Bush said he sensed ``a certain turning around, at least in
terms of public opinion,'' on the issue of drugs, mentioning that
anti-drug messages are being worked into some Saturday morning
cartoon shows.
   ``Twenty million kids watch cartoons every Saturday,'' Bush
said. ``Now, that couldn't have happened if it hadn't been from April 1
through
March 31, 1991. All athletes who qualify may compete in the U.S.

   Swallows made their
traditional St. Joseph's Day appearance in this old mission town
today as hundreds of residents and visitors cheered the fork-tailed
birds' return.
   From the mission church courtyard, Paul Arbiso, 96, and Frank
Velasquez, 68, spotted a small group of swallows flying above the
214-year-old mission. The two hometown residents pulled ropes to
ring the four church bells to formally celebrate the birds'
migratory return from Argentina.
   A handful of swallows and dozens of pigeons flew from the
mission eaves to nearby treetops during the two-minute ringing of
the bells.
   ``It's fun. It's like playing _ pulling the ropes and all,''
said Arbiso, who has sighted the swallows' return for several
decades.
   Swallows had been seen earlier this morning, but by tradition,
Arbiso's sighting signals their official return.
   The swallow watch began in a thick fog shortly after dawn,
kicking off a series of celebrations that end with the Fiesta de
las Golondrinas Parade on Saturday. The morning fog slowly burned
off to reveal a clear blue sky.
   Arbiso, like others present, said the numbers of swallows were
decreasing.
   ``Twenty or thirty years ago, they were all over, flocks of them
coming in and out. I'd sure like to see those days again,'' he said.
   First accounts of the swallows coming to San Juan Capistrano
date back to 1776. That was the year Father Junipero Serra founded
the mission as part of Spain's effort to spread the Roman Catholic
faith in the New World.
   The traditional belief that the birds return every St. Joseph's
Day gained widespread fame because of a hit 1939 song, ``When the
Swallows Come Back to Capistrano.'' According to legend, the
swallows failed to arrive in Capistrano only once, in 1935, when
they were held up by a storm.
   In the fall, the swallows migrate to Goya, Argentina, about
5,000 miles to the south.

<HEAD>Pope Warns Against New Technology Becoming an `Idol'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PIERO VALSECCHI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHIVASSO, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II, visiting one of
Italy's most important technical centers, warned Monday about
making technology the idol of modern times.
   The pope said the dignity of human beings can not be
``sacrificed to the machine'' and that unemployment resulting from
advanced technology ``can't be morally accepted.''
   ``It's necessary to resist the temptation to make technology a
new idol ... technology and its products are not all ... how can we
forget, for example, the polluting effects linked to technological
development ... and questions about the destination of
technological products?'' the pope asked workers during a visit to
the Olivetti and Fiat-Lancia plants.
   The pope visited the Olivetti computer factory in Ivrea and the
Fiat-Lancia auto plant in nearby Chivasso in northern Italy to mark
the feast day of St. Joseph, considered the patron of workers.
   The pontiff frequently has met with groups of workers and spoken
of his own experiences as an employee in a quarry in his native
Poland before he became a priest.
   ``The pope has come here to acknowledge and pay homage to the
dignity of each worker,'' John Paul said in his address to Olivetti
employees.
   John Paul II conceded that technology can be an ally of humans
and said that technological advancement is irreversible.
   But he stressed that the principle of ``man's pre-eminence over
technology'' must be remembered.
   ``Automation and sophisticated equipment are causing not a few
problems for workers, their families and society,'' he added,
speaking in Italian.
   In Ivrea, the pope was welcomed by Carlo De Benedetti, who heads
a financial empire including the Olivetti corporation.
   Fiat's chairman, Gianni Agnelli, stood at the pope's side in an
open van during the visit to Lancia.
   Production at the Lancia plant, which employs 5,000 workers and
makes more than 500 cars a day, was suspended during the pope's
speech in a huge tent.
   The pope called on the Lancia workers to show solidarity with
immigrants, who have been streaming into Italy by the thousands in
recent years from northern Africa and other impoverished areas.
   ``Each man must have the right to seek working opportunities ...
also beyond national and continental borders,'' he said.
   ``Humanity by now lives in a single village ... because of the
growing interdependence among humans and nations.''

<TEXT>
   Isabella Stewart Gardner, founder and lone patron
of the Gardner Museum, assembled an art collection unique among
American galleries and a museum stamped with her own incorrigible,
eccentric personality.
   Extravagant, selfish, ambitious and daring to the point of
imprudence, Mrs. Gardner, as she was always called, was known for
her ability to swig beer and heft an ax like the men of the day.
She was a woman who did everything a proper Boston woman of the
late 19th and early 20th centuries would not do.
   In taking a priceless cache of art from her former home on
Sunday, two thieves violated Mrs. Gardner's cardinal rule by moving
her paintings from their assigned locations.
   ``She was an amazing character,'' said Cleveland Amory, author
of ``The Proper Bostonians,'' an account of the city's
``Brahmins.'' ``She was a very individual person.''
   Tales of Mrs. Gardner's exploits abound. She was known to walk
down the city's Tremont Street with her pet lion, Rex, on a leash.
When she gave parties at her Beacon Street home she greeted her
guests not from the door, but perched on a branch in a tree.
   Wealth was never novel to Mrs. Gardner. She was the daughter of
a successful New York dry goods merchant and married John Lowell
Gardner, son of the last of Boston's East India merchants, in 1860.
   But while other turn-of-the-century Boston bluebloods played
down their riches, Mrs. Gardner flaunted hers.
   Warned by other high-society Boston women that she should keep
her jewels tucked away in a safe deposit box, she had two of her
largest diamonds set on gold wires so she could wear them like
antennae.
   In 1898, shortly after her husband died, she had a nervous
breakdown. When she recovered, doctors suggested she take up a
hobby, which became her museum.
   A 15th century Venetian palace was dismantled and brought to
Boston, where Mrs. Gardner supervised its incorporation into her
home and museum. The museum is frozen in time: Nothing may be
altered, nothing may be moved from its assigned place, nothing may
be loaned, nothing may be sold and nothing may be added to the
collection.
   Peter Sutton, curator of Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, called
the Gardner Museum one of three great art collections assembled by
turn-of-the-century aristocrats. He said the others are those of
the Frick in New York and of attorney John G. Johnson, now at the
Philadelphia Museum of Art.
   ``The Gardner is a testament to another era,'' Sutton said.
``It's not only important because of the works it houses, but
important to the history of American art collecting. It's a great
tribute to old style, blue-chip collecting.''
   While Mrs. Gardner footed the bill for the museum's
construction, she wasn't afraid to get her hands dirty. She
personally supervised the building, to the point of climbing on
scaffolds to mix paint to the precise color she sought.
   Whenever she worked, a trumpeter stood nearby to summon workmen,
one note for the architect, another for the plumber, and so on.
   ``She was there every damn day,'' Amory said. ``Once, she
grabbed an ax to hew a heavy beam to show workmen how it should be
done.''
   The official opening of the museum was celebrated with a gala on
Jan. 1, 1903. Only workmen had seen the inside of the palace.
Confronted with the problem of testing the acoustics in the music
room before the ball, Mrs. Gardner had a characteristic solution.
She contacted the Perkins Institute for the Blind and gathered an
audience of blind children for an afternoon concert and test run.
   Mrs. Gardner lived in the top floor of the mansion until her
death in 1924 at age 85. But she opened her home and its collection
to the public long before then.
   She built the collection with the help of a young Lithuanian
immigrant named Bernard Berenson, who became one of the most
respected art historians.
   On her own, Gardner convinced T. Jefferson Coolidge to loan her
Sargent's ``El Jaleo,'' and then never gave it back. To protect her
stolen prize, she built a cloister around the work, making it
nearly impossible to remove.
   The collection contains 290 paintings and 280 pieces of
sculpture, as well as religious objects, period furniture,
textiles, ceramics and documents and books by famous writers and
political figures.
   Amory said the museum is unique because it bore the indelible
stamp of Mrs. Gardner's personality.
   ``Others, like Frick, had more money and bigger collections,''
Amory said. ``But the personality of the Gardner Museum is hers.
It's one person's taste and one person's castle.''

<HEAD>Clashes Flare in Both Christian and Shiite Feuds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Christian forces traded mortar and
gunfire in east Beirut Monday, while Shiite Moslem militias pounded
each other with artillery and tank fire in south Lebanon, police
reported.
   They said one soldier of renegade Gen. Michel Aoun's army was
wounded in gun battles with Lebanese Forces militiamen of Christian
warlord Samir Geagea in east Beirut's Sin el-Fil residential
district.
   The hostilities threatened a cease-fire called March 3 to halt
the bloodiest Christian power struggle since Lebanon's civil war
started 15 years ago.
   By police count, 762 people were killed and 2,116 wounded since
Aoun's fight with Geagea for control of the 310-square-mile enclave
started Jan. 30.
   Police said no casualties were reported from the fighting in
south Lebanon between the Iranian-backed fundamentalist Hezbollah,
or Party of God, and the pro-Syran mainstream Amal militia.
   A Hezbollah communique accused Amal of launching a surprise
attack with tanks to recapture two strategic villages in Iqlim
al-Tuffah, the Apple Province, southeast of the port city of Sidon.
   The communique said Hezbollah's fighters repulsed Amal's
onslaught on the villages of Kfar Hatta and Kfar Melki after heavy
fighting with tanks, mortars and 106mm recoilless guns from dusk
Sunday to dawn Monday.
   Amal withheld comment on Hezbollah's communique. But police
described the fighting as the heaviest in the region since a
cease-fire brokered by Iran silenced the guns in Iqlim al-Tuffah in
early February.
   The two factions have been locked in a power struggle since
1987, for control of the 1.2 million Shiites, Lebanon's largest
sect.
   Their mini-wars erupt periodically in south Lebanon and Beirut's
Shiite-populated southern slums.
   In a separate event, Lebanon's Central Bank employees Monday
called off an open-ended strike that was staged to protest an
attempt to arrest the bank's governor.
   A statement issued in the name of the bank's 700 employees said
they hoped such an incident will not happen again.
   Interior Minister Elias Khazen on Thursday sent a police patrol
to arrest Gov. Edmond Naim, but the attempt was foiled by bank
guards. A bank administrator was wounded in the brief shootout.

   Dozens of cameras whirred as a sniffling
President Bush coughed and blew his nose. ``It's news: a little hay
fever in the air around here,'' the president apologized to his
audience.
   Then, looking straight at the now-quieted cameras, Bush raised
his handkerchief with a flourish for an exagerrated honk of his
nose.
   Flashes lit the room like lightning and electric camera motors
hummed in unison.
   ``They've got their job to do and I got mine,'' the president
told a gathering of state attorneys general in the White House's
Roosevelt Room.
   Then he rubbed his nose again. The cameras again came to life.
   ``Come on, you guys,'' Bush scolded.
   The president, who suffers from allergies, said he ``got hit''
with the bout of hay fever Sunday. He spent the weekend at the
well-foliated presidential retreat in the Catoctin Mountains of
Maryland.
   Tom Miller, attorney general of Iowa and president of the
National Association of Attorneys General, told Bush: ``Thank you
for being with us, and thank you for the education in Washington
that, when the president sneezes, it makes news.''
   ``They like to needle me a little bit,'' Bush said of the camera
operators and photographers. ``I'll get even.''

   Membership of a unified Germany in NATO would
upset the balance of power in Europe and should not be allowed, a
Soviet spokesman said Monday.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said at a news
briefing that the Soviet Union respected the will of the people of
East Germany, but added that they must in turn respect the rights
of others.
   A conservative coalition that swept to victory in East German
elections Sunday strongly favors speedy reunification with West
Germany.
   ``We respect the expressed will of the citizens of East Germany,
an allied sovereign state,'' Gerasimov said. ``Respecting this
right of choice, we proceed from the premise that in turn, they
will respect the legitimate interests of the Soviet Union and other
countries.''
   Gerasimov said Germans had the right of unification, but he
repeated the Soviet position that a unified Germany could not
become a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   He said the process of unification should come about in
carefully planned stages, with cooperation between the East and
West. ``It should not be a member of NATO,'' Gerasimov said. ``That
would upset the balance of Europe.''
   Gerasimov said the Soviets wanted both parts of a unified
Germany to be demilitarized and the problems of European security
should be approached with a view of overcoming the ``inertia of
bloc approaches.''

<HEAD>Former Burlington Mayor Announces Congressional Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MEG DENNISON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Burlington Mayor Bernard Sanders,
hoping to build upon his strong showing in the 1988 race, said
today that he would run again for Congress this year.
   Sanders, who gained wide attention as the nation's only
socialist mayor during his eight years as Burlington mayor, said he
opted for Congress instead of running for governor, as he had
considered doing, because of concerns over national and
international issues.
   ``I can honestly say that there is no race that I have ever run
in which I feel more enthusiastic, more confident, and which has,
for me, a greater sense of urgency,'' he said in his announcement.
   Sanders came in second in the 1988 race for Vermont's only seat
in the U.S. House.
   The race was won by Republican Peter Smith, with 41 percent.
Sanders, running as an independent, gained 38 percent, while the
Democratic nominee, former Vermont House Majority Leader Paul
Poirier received only 19 percent.
   Sanders, who was Burlington mayor from 1981-89, considers
himself a socialist but runs as an independent and said he would do
so again this year.
   It appears at this time, however, that the Democrats will not
put up a strong candidate, and perhaps will not put up any
candidate at all against Smith, giving Sanders something he has
never had in a statewide race: a head-to-head contest.
   But a race against Smith, now an incumbent with support among
Democrats as well as Republicans, will not be easy. The League for
Conservation Voters has already endorsed Smith, even without
knowing who he would have as an opponent. Sanders began his
political career in Vermont with the Liberty Union, a third
political party that is unique to the state. But he left that party
and statewide politics to run for mayor of Burlington in 1981. He
ousted the incumbent and went on to serve eight years.
   In 1986 he returned to statewide politics, with a gubernatorial
run, in which he finished third, behind Gov. Madeleine Kunin and
Smith, then the lieutenant governor.

   Arista Records drew on some of the hottest names
in the recording industry in marking its 15th anniversary with a
concert billed as the largest single event to benefit AIDS victims.
   Hall &amp; Oates belted out their latest single, ``Starting All Over
Again,'' Whitney Houston delighted the crowd with a charged
rendition of ``The Greatest Love of All'' and Patti Smith sang a
moody version of ``A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall'' at Saturday's
five-hour concert in Radio City Music Hall.
   Artists and guest hosts repeatedly reminded the enthusiastic
crowd of their reason for attending, with Jennifer Holliday
dedicating a song to Broadway director and playwright Michael
Bennett who died of AIDS in 1987.
   In a solo skit portraying an 8-year-old AIDS victim, Whoopi
Goldberg drew laughs, sighs and tears as she demonstrated the
numerous misconceptions of the fatal disease.
   Even the ever-silly Chevy Chase switched gears and solemnly
intoned that such events can help eradicate the bigotry and hatred
confronting AIDS sufferers. ``It's everyone's job to stop the
panic,'' he said.
   Organizers said the ``That's What Friends Are For'' concert
raised more than $2 million and is to be broadcast on CBS in April.
Proceeds went to the Gay Men's Health Crisis and other AIDS
organizations.
   Virtually every major artist on the Arista label performed,
including Dionne Warwick, Bob Weir, Melissa Manchester, Lisa
Stansfield, Jermaine Jackson, the Jeff Healey Band and Anderson
Bruford Wakeman Howe.
   At the finale, Warwick sang ``That's What Friends Are For''
accompanied by Burt Bacharach, and most of the night's performers
joined in.
   Warwick recorded the chart-topping single in 1986 with Elton
John, Stevie Wonder and Gladys Knight, raising more than $1 million
in royalties for the American Foundation for AIDS Research.

   Dolly Parton plans to buy the radio
station where she taped her first songs. She wants to move it to
her Dollywood theme park in nearby Pigeon Forge.
   The country music queen announced Monday she is buying WSEV-AM
and FM, pending Federal Communications Commission approval. No
price was disclosed.
   ``The planned relocation to Dollywood will better serve the
hometown listeners as well as the millions of visitors to the Smoky
Mountains,'' she said in a statement.
   At age 9, Ms. Parton went with her uncle, Bill Owens, to WSEV to
tape two songs they had written together, ``Puppy Love'' and ``Girl
Left Alone.'' It was their first single for Gold Band Records.
   ``The quality of the recording would be considered substandard
compared to today's technology because it was recorded through a
single microphone,'' former WSEV co-managers Mary Sue Poe and Skip
Trotter said in a statement.
   The theme park plans to display the original microphone and
other equipment Ms. Parton used to tape the two songs. Visitors
also will be able to see the modern station in operation.

   Former auto racing champion Stirling Moss suffered
a broken thigh when he was hit by a car while driving a motor
scooter in central London, and should take six months to recover,
doctors said.
   Doctors inserted three metal pins in the 60-year-old former
Grand Prix driver's thigh bone after Monday's accident, said
publicist Linda Patterson.
   The car allegedly ran a yield sign and hit Moss, who was going
20 mph on an errand to buy coriander, Ms. Patterson said. Police
were investigating, she added.
   ``I have been told the recovery process will be a slow one _
about six months,'' Moss said in a statement. ``In all my racing
career, in which I have had quite a few shunts, I have never been
kept from behind the wheel for even half that length of time, apart
from my 1962 accident.''
   Moss crashed at 90 mph during a race at Britain's Goodwood track
in 1962. He was dragged unconscious from his car, remained in a
coma for three days and was paralyzed for six months.
   Since his career began in 1950, Moss has competed in 494 races
or speed records, winning 222, including 16 Grand Prix. He won the
British national championships nine times.

   Zahn, 34, is the latest in a line of female co-anchors on CBS's
third-place morning show, following Phyllis George, Mariette

the most profitable product, that we can. Those changes are an

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
arrived today in Namibia, where he aims to mix celebration with
negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa and to achieve a
cease-fire in Angola.
   In six fast-paced days, Baker plans to visit three countries,
including South Africa _ the first secretary of state to go there
since 1978. He will fly to Cape Town on Thursday to show U.S.
appreciation for the preliminary steps taken by President F.W. de
Klerk and to try to drive him to go faster.
   To underscore U.S. support for the black movement Baker will go
on Friday to Soweto, the black township outside Johannesburg, for
talks there with Desmond Tutu, the black Anglican archbishop, and
other black leaders. Soweto has been the cradle of the
anti-apartheid movement.
   Baker joined world leaders gathered in Windhoek, the capital,
for independence ceremonies. Namibia was pried from South Africa's
control with the help of U.S. diplomacy that is now shifting its
focus to Pretoria, where a white minority government is being urged
to dismantle racial segregation.
   Baker made no comment on arriving at the airport and he and his
party were whisked away in a convoy of cars.
   Baker will meet in Windhoek with Nelson Mandela, the deputy
president of the African National Congress, and then in Cape Town
with de Klerk and Foreign Minister R.F. Botha. ``The purpose of our
seeing these gentlemen is to encourage negotiations, to move as
rapidly as possible, and to see what we can do to contribute to
that,'' a senior U.S. official said.
   Baker also will hold talks in Windhoek with Jose Eduoardo dos
Santos, the president of Angola, a potentially rich African nation
with which the United States has no diplomatic relations. Baker
intends to urge him to negotiate for a share of the government with
Jonas Savimbi, the U.S.-backed leader of the UNITA insurgents in a
14-year war.
   He will see Savimbi in Kinshasa, Zaire, before flying home on
Saturday.
   Baker's aides made clear before his departure that the Bush
administration would not yield to Mandela's demands for stiffer
sanctions against South Africa and would not recognize Angola until
the Luanda government settles with the rebels.
   But Baker also is ready to assure Mandela that the
administration would keep pressuring de Klerk, who will hold
preliminary negotiations April 11 with black leaders, to free all
political prisoners and end a 3{-year state of emergency.
   In Angola, a military standoff since December in Navinga, a
Savimbi stronghold, encourages Baker to promote a cease-fire.
   The country has developed a private economy and ships 75 percent
of its oil to the United States through Chevron and Conoco. But the
United States, alone among major Western countries, has withheld
recognition.
   Soviet support for Angola and Cuban troops in the country were
the biggest reasons.
   About half of the 50,000 Cubans have left under a complex
agreement that also ended South African control over Namibia. The
rest are supposed to depart by next year.
   But Soviet aid, even though it is decreasing, ``continues to be
humongous,'' a senior U.S. official said, insisting on anonymity.
``We're talking about a decrease from about a billion dollars a
year to $600 million.''
   ``We're not asking for the overthrow of the government,'' the
official said. ``We are not asking for any type of regime. We're
not asking that Jonas Savimbi be made president of Angola.
   ``All we're asking for is for the government of Angola to
reconcile with a major dissident organization which represents a
significant number of Angolan people,'' the official said. In the
event of ``a new political order, we will be very happy to bow
out.''

<HEAD>Mazowiecki Coming to United States</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki is
coming to the United States to seek support for the Solidarity-led
government's demand that a treaty guaranteeing Poland's western
border be signed before Germany unifies.
   The former Solidarity editor and political prisoner leaves
Warsaw on Tuesday for a six-day visit to the United States, with a
one-day stop in Canada. It will be Mazowiecki's longest abroad
since he was elected in August to lead the first non-Communist
government in the East bloc.
   ``I don't need to stress the significance of the visit for
Poland to a country which is the world's No. 1 superpower,''
government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska said recently,
outlining the goals of the visit.
   Mazowiecki achieved one aim of his trip when the four victorious
World War II allies and the two Germanys last week decided to allow
Poland to take part in sessions of ``two-plus-four'' talks that
concern Poland's security.
   Now, Mazowiecki will be pushing for U.S. backing of his
government's demand that a treaty guaranteeing Poland's western
border be initialed by East Germany and West Germany before
unification and then ratified by a unified Germany.
   Treaties commit the Germanys to respect the Oder and Neisse
rivers as Poland's western border, but a unified Germany is not
bound by those terms.
   Poles are concerned by some in Germany who urge reunification be
sought within the 1937 borders that included about one-third of
present-day Poland.
   Warsaw has not been satisfied by a resolution backed by West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl asking parliaments in West Germany
and East Germany to adopt declarations saying a united Germany
should sign a treaty affirming the Poles' right to live in secure
borders.
   ``We would like the U.S. to act towards stabilization of
transformations taking place in Europe and to support, as it has
always done, the Polish interests, particularly those concerning
the process of German unification,'' Janusz Onyszkiewicz, former
Solidarity spokesman and now a deputy to parliament, told the PAP
news agency Monday.
   Germany unity, developments in central Europe, security and
defense issues, and economic cooperation are expected to be the
topics of talks between Mazowiecki and President Bush.
   ``Prospects for Polish-American cooperation are better today
than at any time since the end of World War II. This new attitude
results from what happened and is happening in Poland, and that
Washington has appreciated the importance of Polish events,'' said
a commentary Monday in the Zycie Warszawy newspaper.
   Mazowiecki also is to meet with U.S. Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, members of Congress and
other top U.S. officials.
   Mazowiecki, a lawyer, practicing Roman Catholic and top adviser
to Solidarity leader Lech Walesa for a decade, is expected to focus
on talks rather than the public appearances that characterized
Walesa's trip to the United States in November.
   Niezabitowska said Mazowiecki is to address the Council on
Foreign Relations, and meet with representatives of Jewish
organizations and groups of American Poles.
   Mazowiecki also will be pursuing increased financial aid and
cooperation for his radical economic reform program.
   With the blessing of the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund, the Solidarity-led government introduced a
pro-market reform plan Jan. 1 that lifted most price controls,
ended many government subsidies to industry and made the zloty a
convertible currency.
   Niezabitowska said Mazowiecki plans to extend Poland's thanks
for the help it has received from the United States in direct aid
and in dealings with the Paris Club, the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund.
   Further assistance in restructuring Poland's $41 billion debt _
$3.1 billion of which is owed to the United States _ also is
expected to be discussed.
   Mazowiecki also will be seeking a reduction of restrictions on
technology imports, a broadening of U.S. business investment in
Poland, and expansion of credit guarantees.
   Warsaw would like Washington to lift travel restrictions placed
on Polish diplomats following the 1981 martial-law crackdown to
crush Solidarity.
   It also would like to open a consulate in California, where many
Polish emigres have settled, as well as an easing of U.S.
restrictions on issuing visas to Poles. Niezabitowska said more
than 60 percent of all Polish applications for U.S. visas are
rejected.
   Mazowiecki will travel to Canada for one day after his U.S. trip
for talks with Canadian officials.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Leaves Fines Against Puerto Rico Intact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court rejected the advice of 31
states Monday as it left intact $30 million in fines against Puerto
Rico for failing to relieve prison overcrowding.
   The justices, without comment, refused to disturb rulings that
the government of the island commonwealth failed to respond fast
enough to a federal judge's order that the overcrowding cease.
   Most states are under similar court orders to improve prison
conditions.
   Officials for 31 states told the high court that such strict
enforcement of federal court penalties could delay voluntary prison
reforms.
   The states are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Delaware,
Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New
Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia
and Wyoming.
   The court issued orders in more than 200 cases Monday as it
returned from a two-week recess. Justice William J. Brennan was
missing from the bench, reportedly suffering from a stomach flu
since Thursday.
   In other matters, the court:
   _Rejected arguments that a college professor hired to help the
two owners of a North Carolina adult movie and book store fight
obscenity charges wrongly was inhibited from surveying Charlotte
area residents about their opinions of sexually explicit materials.
   _Agreed to decide in a case from Pennsylvania whether a federal
anti-counterfeiting law may be used to crack down on the sale of
cars with falsified mileage readings.
   _Refused to become embroiled in the continuing fight between
environmentalists and the Bush administration over Oregon timber
and the northern spotted owl.
   _Heard arguments over the obligation of U.S. banks with branch
offices overseas to pay depositors after foreign governments seize
or freeze those accounts.
   Robert H. Bork, the former federal judge whose Supreme Court
nomination was rejected by the Senate in 1987, represented Citibank
in that case _ marking what was believed to be the first time a
failed Supreme Court nominee subsequently appeared before the high
court.
   The Puerto Rico case stems from a 1979 lawsuit. A federal judge
ruled the next year that each inmate initially must be provided at
least 35 square feet of cell space, and ultimately 55 square feet
in dormitories and 70 square feet in individual cells.
   Commonwealth officials in 1986 agreed to comply with the court
order, and began to expand prison capacity.
   But in July 1987 the officials were fined for failing to provide
35 square feet of space per prisoner. By November, the fines
approached a total of $30 million.
   Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon and other officials said tropical
rains and an unexpected increase in the prison population prevented
them from meeting their own deadlines for easing overcrowding.
   They said they inherited the problem from a previous
administration and had more than tripled the commonwealth's prison
budget. Prison capacity was increased from 5,400 in 1985 to 10,295
last year, they said.
   But the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the fines in
September.
   ``The relevant harm, confinement in an area smaller than 5-by-7
feet, is significant,'' the appeals court said. ``The number of
prisoners suffering that harm, 7 to 10 percent, is large. And the
time since entry of the remedial decree is long.''

<HEAD>North Dakota's Eccentric Labor Commissioner Under Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DALE WETZEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state labor commissioner, known for
his bib overalls and frugality, is running for a second term
against a field of unknowns. His critics say he's incompetent.
   ``I'm alive and ready to go punching,'' said Byron Knutson, 60,
a Democrat whose eccentricities and penchant for beating
party-endorsed candidates in primary elections have won him a
reputation as a political maverick.
   Knutson, dismissing his critics as politically motivated and Lt.
Gov. Lloyd Omdahl as a ``snothead'' and ``meddling nincompoop,''
says he'll be in office when his enemies ``are pushing up daisies
from their political graves.''
   He certainly is better known than his seven declared opponents,
who include a retired Navy man, a diesel mechanic, a 24-year-old
rancher and two state senators, one of whom once introduced
legislation to abolish the labor job.
   The only declared Democratic candidate, a former labor union
official, pleaded guilty to drunken driving days after his
announcement.
   ``It would be tough ... to pick out a good candidate in the
field,'' the Grand Forks Herald said in an editorial. ``Still, the
incompetent incumbent makes the seven other candidates attractive
in comparison.''
   Knutson's office handles wage claims, discrimination
allegations, firing disputes and other job-related matters. His
office has seven workers, including Knutson, whose annual salary is
$49,300.
   Tales of Knutson's quirks and frugality have bolstered his
popularity.
   He occasionally shows up for work in striped bib overalls during
North Dakota's freezing winters. He attended his 1976 inauguration
as insurance commissioner in a suit he bought at a thrift store for
35 cents.
   ``I was in school at the time. You have to adjust expenditures
to income,'' he said. ``They just happened to have something that
fit me.''
   His critics, including Democrats Gov. George Sinner and Attorney
General Nicholas Spaeth, want Knutson to resign, but he has ignored
them.
   The Labor Department's average time for handling a wage claim
has doubled since Knutson took office, and his backlog of cases has
ballooned, says state auditor Gordy Smith.
   Knutson, who often works nights on cases with help from his
wife, Bernice, says his own audits show his backlog is considerably
less than state auditors say.
   Omdahl, saying he has ``never seen such a mess in state
government in my life,'' concedes state officials are powerless
over Knutson, who is independently elected.
   The dispute over his management led to a recent confrontation
with Omdahl, who heads a legislative oversight committee that is
looking into the Labor Department.
   Knutson bumped Omdahl as the lieutenant governor tried to leave
during a recess, and later referred to Omdahl as a ``snothead'' and
a ``meddling nincompoop.'' Mrs. Knutson poked the lieutenant
governor in the chest as she protested his opinion of her husband.
   ``I need a manager,'' Omdahl joked later, and an editorial
cartoon pictured Knutson in a boxing robe.
   ``Give and take is part of the way the public business ... is
conducted,'' Knutson said. ``Sometimes it's more refined than other
ways.''
   A former state legislator, Knutson served four years as state
insurance commissioner and ran unsuccessfully for secretary of
state and the Public Service Commission before winning the labor
office from a Republican in 1986.
   In three of his six statewide races, Knutson defeated the
Democrats' endorsed candidate in the primary.
   Knutson is a gregarious campaigner with a ready handshake and
knack for remembering names, and his Norwegian surname helps in a
state where 15 percent of the population has Norwegian ancestry.
   Sinner says voters in the June 12 primary will have to judge the
situation, and Knutson says he's perfectly content to let them.
   ``I'm not going to take anything for granted and say it's a
cinch,'' Knutson said. ``We work as if we need every last contact.
I like to be out amidst it. I need to have a certain amount of the
chin sticking out.''

   A dispute between the Soviet Union and the
United States over the use of X-ray equipment to inspect Soviet
missile canisters is close to being resolved, the State Department
said Monday.
   Productive talks have been held between U.S. and Soviet
technical teams about the use of the Cargoscan inspection system to
probe canisters emerging from the Soviet missile plant at Votkinsk,
the department said.
   Asked if Soviet objections to the use of the system are on the
way to being settled, department spokesman Richard Boucher replied:
``I think that's fair.''
   ``But I don't want to say it's over,'' Boucher added, noting
that talks are continuing.
   American inspectors at the Votkinsk facility, about 700 miles
east of Moscow, filed an unprecedented complaint last week after
the Soviets objected to the use of Cargospan to verify the contents
of at least three missile canisters.
   The objective is to make sure canisters leaving the plant don't
contain medium-range missiles banned under the 1987 U.S.-Soviet
Intermediate Nuclear Forces or INF treaty.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III lodged an official protest
over the incident with his counterpart, Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, and technical teams were dispatched to
Votkinsk to attempt to thresh out the matter.
   Cargospan is a key element in verifying Soviet compliance with
the terms of the INF treaty, and some U.S. officials fear that
continued Soviet objections to its use could give a new weapon to
arms-control critics on Capitol Hill who see the incident as proof
that such treaties are not adequately verifiable.
   They also are concerned about the potential adverse impact on
negotiations in Geneva aimed at sharply reducing the numbers of
long-range, intercontinental missiles.
   Other officials argue that chances for successfully negotiating
a Strategic Arms Reduction, or START, treaty are enhanced when the
United States recognizes in advance the technical issues that can
arise after a treaty has been signed.
   They note that the Bush administration has emphasized in START
and other arms-control negotiations experiments and measures to
test the technical means of verification before a treaty is signed.
   An array of verification measures proposed by the United States
has been under discussion at the START talks since July.

   An Iran-Contra prosecutor today inadvertently
brought out John Poindexter's immunized congressional testimony
about destroying a politically embarrassing presidential document.
   With Rep. Lee Hamilton on the witness stand, prosecutor Dan Webb
asked whether Poindexter ever reported destroying the document,
called a finding.
   ``He did,'' Hamilton said in front of the jury. The congressman
was referring to Poindexter's July 1987 testimony in which the
former national security adviser admitted tearing up the document.
   No part of a prosecutor's case may be derived from a defendant's
immunized testimony.
   As soon as Hamilton answered, another prosecutor, Howard Pearl,
stood up. Webb quickly said, ``I see the problem.''
   Webb rephrased the question, but Poindexter lawyer Richard
Beckler said that ``I will made an argument on this,'' indicating
that the defense may move for a mistrial.
   Hamilton also testified that he had no indication the National
Security Council was lying to him in 1985 when it denied assisting
the Contras.
   Hamilton, who was chairman of the House intelligence committee
in 1985 and 1986, testified for the prosecution as it began
wrapping up its case against Poindexter, onetime national security
adviser to President Reagan.
   Poindexter is accused of covering up Oliver North's military
assistance to the Contras and the U.S. role in a November 1985
shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.
   Hamilton told the court today that Congress approved the Boland
Amendment cutting off U.S. military aid to the Contras in order to
stop the war in Nicaragua.
   Iran-Contra prosecutor Dan Webb told Hamilton that ``Oliver
North has testified'' that written answers denying the NSC was
assisting the Contras ``were all false.''
   Did Hamilton have any idea the answers were false? asked Webb.
   ``I had no such indications,'' said the Indiana Democrat.
   Poindexter embraced the denials in 1986 as Congress continued to
inquire into whether the NSC was assisting the Contras.
   Also scheduled to testify for the prosecution was Eric Newsome,
a former Senate intelligence committee staffer who attended a
meeting on the Hawk missiles with Poindexter.
   The heart of the government's case is North's testimony, given
reluctantly against his former boss.
   The former White House aide testified that he didn't want to
meet with Hamilton, then chairman of the House intelligence
committee, to discuss whether North was giving military assistance
to the Contras.
   North told Poindexter he might be asked questions about matters
which he was supposed to keep secret.
   Poindexter sent him to the meeting anyway, telling him ``you can
handle it or you can take care of it,'' North testified.
   North lied at the meeting, saying he hadn't met with Contra
supporter John Singlaub for 20 months, had only casual contact with
Contra liaison Robert Owen and wasn't giving military advice to the
rebels.
   Hamilton also attended the Nov. 21, 1986, meeting with
Poindexter, who told the intelligence committee he didn't learn of
the Hawks shipment until January 1986. Poindexter made a similar
statement the same day to the Senate intelligence committee.
   The prosecution says Poindexter's motive for concealing the U.S.
role in the shipment was the existence of a politically
embarrassing presidential finding that depicted the Hawks shipment
as a straight arms-for-hostages deal. Poindexter tore up the
finding the same day he testified before the committees.
   North testified that he watched Poindexter destroy the finding
in the national security adviser's office.
   Poindexter's lawyers begin presenting their case next and are
expected to replay former President Reagan's videotaped testimony.
The former president made a number of comments favorable to
Poindexter, including a suggestion that it might have been
acceptable to destroy documents in the affair to protect national
security.

   Former world champion Anatoli
Karpov on Monday requested a postponement of his seventh game
against Jan Timman in the World Chess Championship Candidates Final
Match.
   On Sunday, Karpov failed to win the sixth game in a much
superior position. Entering the endgame, the Soviet grandmaster,
playing white, was a pawn up with a rook and knight against
Timman's rook and bishop.
   Karpov, however, could not make any headway without giving up
his extra pawn and exchanging his knight.
   The seventh game will be played Wednesday.
   Karpov leads the 12-game series by four points to Timman's two
having won the first and fourth games with the rest drawn.
   The first player to amass 6{ points will be declared the winner
and advance to face Garri Kasparov for the world title in Lyons,
France, in October.
   Timman, 39, of the Netherlands, needs to win a game to bolster
his morale.
   In their 55 meetings so far, Karpov also 39, has triumphed 18
times compared to Timman's three with the rest drawn. Timman has
not beaten Karpov since 1982.

   A woman was sentenced Monday to 15
years-to-life in prison for the starvation death of her 2-month-old
daughter.
   Tonnette Rae Lee, 29, and her husband, James Lowell Lee, 38,
were convicted of second-degree murder after an autopsy revealed
that the baby, Janelle, had no food in her system when she died
Dec. 8, 1988.
   Judge Roger Randall delayed sentencing of Lee until April 16.
   Deputy District Attorney Terry P. Pelton said the infant's
weight fell from 5 pounds, 6 ounces at birth on Oct. 1, 1988, to 3
pounds, 5 ounces when she died nine weeks later.
   ``It was an extreme case of malnutrition,'' Pelton said.
   The defense argued that although a forensic pathologist
testified that the baby died of malnutrition, he could not be sure
whether something else contributed to the death, such as digestive
problems or a birth defect.
   Mrs. Lee said the couple could not afford to take the baby to a
doctor. The couple's two sons are under protective custody of Kern
County officials.

   The Soviet government today issued a harsh warning
that it would not allow Lithuania to put up its own customs posts,
introduce its own currency or take over Moscow-run factories
without permission.
   The warning represented the first concrete steps taken by the
government to counter Lithuania's March 13 declaration of
independence, which President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has called
invalid. However, the warning did not specify what measures the
Kremlin would take to protect its interests.
   The government announcement, read on Soviet TV, accused
Lithuanian leaders of planning to turn over national factories to
private owners, bring in a separate currency and put up customs
posts on the Soviet border.
   The government was especially concerned about nuclear power
plants in the Baltic republic, it said.
   The announcement came as a delegation of Lithuanian legislators
arrived in Moscow seeking talks with Gorbachev on their declaration
of independence.
   In the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, President Vytautus
Landsbergis said Soviet military maneuvers in Lithuania were
increasing tensions in the region.
   On Sunday, Soviet military jets buzzed Vilnius in what many
Lithuanians considered an intimidation tactic, and Soviet troops
held maneuvers in the countryside.
   ``The military exercises of Soviet troops in Lithuania now
underway are intensifying tensions,'' Landsbergis told Lithuania's
legislature, according to Lithuanian television editor Eduardas
Potashinkis, who monitored the meeting.
   The Lithuanian leader said he was told in a meeting with
high-ranking Soviet officers on Sunday that the maneuvers had been
planned long in advance.
   Landsbergis asked if he would be notified in advance of future
maneuvers and one of the officers replied that he could not make
any guarantees.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said he was told
by the Defense Ministry that ``no major military maneuvers are
under way in Lithuania. The armed forces are acting in accordance
with training plans.''
   The six-member delegation that arrived in Moscow was headed by
Egidius Bickauskas, a lawyer who recently resigned from the
Lithuanian Communist Party.
   It was empowered by Lithuania's parliament to meet with
Gorbachev and propose a start of negotiations on independence, said
a spokesman for the Lithuanian nationalist movement, Sajudis.
   The Soviet Congress of People's Deputies on Thursday declared
Lithuania's Feb. 11 declaration of independence illegal and
directed Gorbachev to defend Soviet interests and citizens in the
Baltic republic of 3.8 million.
   On Friday, the Soviet leader sent a cable to Landsbergis, giving
him three days to respond to the decree.
   However, Gorbachev struck a conciliatory tone Sunday, saying he
still planned to talk with Lithuanians about returning to the
Soviet fold. He said no ultimatums had been issued and that he also
wanted negotiations on the question of independence.
   ``I think we shall receive a reply from the authorities of
present-day Lithuania and, depending on what it is, everything will
become clear. The character and content of the answer will define
our next steps,'' he said.
   Gorbachev said earlier this month that before allowing
independence he would demand $34 billion in hard currency _ money
Lithuania would be hard-pressed to obtain _ in compensation for
Soviet investments in the republic.
   If it wishes to exert economic pressure, the Kremlin also has
the option of cutting off supplies of cheap energy and raw
materials.
   Landsbergis drafted a reply to Gorbachev's message over the
weekend and a Sajudis spokesman, Andreas Ajubalis, said it declared
that Lithuania's parliament ``has the mandate to enter negotiations
with the U.S.S.R. government.''
   ``The main thing now is to reach an agreement in principle in
starting the negotiating process,'' he said.
   Bickauskas, who is also a deputy in the national Supreme Soviet,
said at today's Kremlin session that the situation in the republic
was normal and ``the Lithuanian government is in control.''
   He said the Lithuanian legislature on Saturday confirmed its
decision to declare independence and urged the Soviet Union ``to
solve the issue through inter-state talks.''
   Lithuania, along with the other Baltic republics of Latvia and
Estonia, was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.
   Gorbachev, speaking to reporters after voting in local runoff
elections in Moscow on Monday, continued to insist the Lithuanian
break was illegal and must be decided by the entire Soviet Union.
   He said economic, political, cultural and technical ties were
too strong to tear apart, and ``human contacts have become
particularly deep. So it is a futile attempt to destroy them.'' He
expressed concern for Lithuania's ethnic minorities _ mainly
Russians and Poles.
   Nikolai Medvedev, a member of the Lithuanian delegation and a
deputy in the national Congress, said in an interview at the
Congress today that they hoped to meet with Gorbachev today, but no
appointment had been set.
   ``We are here and waiting to be called,'' he said. ``We will
stay here as long as it takes.''
   He said he did not expect an immediate start to negotiations.
``There will be some delay as the issues are contemplated, then,
negotiations will start at the official level, and eventually,
actual negotiations.''
   On Saturday, Landsbergis appealed to democratic nations for
official recognition of his new government. So far, no country has
recognized Lithuanian independence.

<HEAD>History of Famed Naturalist Disappearing Along With Indian Murals</HEAD>

   In a crumbling Navajo hogan on a rise
dotted with pinon and juniper, colorful wall paintings of Kiowa
rituals and Hopi Kachina figures are washing into the red dirt.
   Rain and snow fall through what once was a conical roof, eating
away the Indian murals: A brave raises his arms toward a buffalo,
another beats a drum, dancers chant and hold prayer wands, a
funeral procession makes its way.
   Vanishing with them is part of the history of naturalist Ernest
Thompson Seton, who founded the Woodcraft Indians organization at
the turn of the century, championed Indians when many saw them as
red devils, and who built the Navajo hogan as part of his College
of Indian Wisdom in the 1930s.
   The British-born, Canadian-raised Seton was 70 in 1930 when he
bought 2,500 acres of land near Santa Fe to build Seton Village, an
artist colony and cultural center.
   A national historic landmark since 1966, Seton Village includes
the 30-room, stone Seton Castle; a kiva, or ceremonial chamber,
decorated with the plumed serpent of the San Ildefonso Indian
pueblo; and the circular Navajo hogan with the damaged murals.
   ``It was painted by a Kiowa Indian named Jack Hokeah, who was at
the Indian School'' in Santa Fe, said Dee Seton Barber, Seton's
daughter. ``The hogan was for public ceremonies _ a campfire and
stories, a dance demonstration or whatever, a Woodcraft council.''
   Mrs. Barber, who still lives in Seton Castle, said she had the
hogan re-roofed 18 years ago, but can't afford to do it again.
Time, weather and vandals have nearly destroyed it.
   Seton built his rambling mansion after a lifetime as an author,
illustrator, naturalist and lecturer. It was designed to house his
library of 40,000 books, nearly 3,000 paintings and drawings, and
3,000 bird and animal skins.
   He wrote hundreds of books and articles, including ``Wild
Animals I Have Known,'' ``Two Little Savages,'' and the first Boy
Scout manual.
   He hobnobbed with Teddy Roosevelt and Mark Twain, helped found
the American Boy Scouts and was named their first Chief Scout. But
he fell out with Roosevelt and scouting leaders because he believed
the movement had turned too militaristic in World War I.
   He urged the government to give back Indian hunting grounds,
helped Southwestern Indians support themselves through
tradition-based pottery, textiles and jewelry rather than cheap
tourist knickknacks, and brought Indians to Seton Village to share
their traditions, songs, stories and art.
   He adopted his daughter in 1938, when he was 78.
   At its height, the village had a zoo, a museum, a craft shop,
dining hall, log cabins, and adobe houses. Up to 150 people could
gather: youngsters studying Indian lore, Seton lecturing to adults
on the virtues of outdoor life, his wife, Julia, beating a drum and
singing an evening chant at lights out.
   Snapshots taken in the 1930s and 1940s show intricate wood
carvings over entrances to dorms and the dining hall, long rows of
tepees, a thriving vegetable garden.
   Many adobe houses remain, some rebuilt and expanded. Other
buildings, including the dining hall, dorms and dance lodge, are
gone and the hogan nearly so.
   The National Park Service oversees national historic landmarks,
but has no repair money for them. It reported in 1986 that the
outside of the hogan could be patched for $6,000. It also
recommended spending $2,800 to have an art conservator evaluate the
paintings inside before restoring them.
   The kiva, with the plumed serpent painting circling its inner
wall, at that time needed $5,450 in exterior work, plus interior
repairs, evaluation and outside grading costing an estimated $2,300.
   Those findings were made in a ``landmarks at risk'' report
soliciting donations to the National Park Foundation, which
administers private contributions for the Park Service.
   But ``we were unsuccessful with Seton Village,'' said Gregory D.
Kendrick, chief of the history unit at the Park Service's Rocky
Mountain Regional Office.
   Now the weather and vandal damage to the hogan is far more
severe, and it's unclear whether any of the murals can be saved.
   ``I don't even go out there anymore,'' said Mrs. Barber. ``It
just makes me sick.''

   Are you a husky, square-faced Texan born
and bred? If you have a yellowish coat, white stocking feet and a
white polecat streak down your back, the heifers of the LBJ Ranch
are looking for a handsome Texas Hereford bull like you.
   The National Park Service is searching for an especially
handsome bull to maintain the cattle bloodlines on this ranch that
was the pride of President Johnson.
   At LBJ's request, the ranch was given to the government in 1973
so that visitors could see what the ranch was like when he was
chief executive.
   Despite the U.S. beef industry's drive to produce taller, leaner
cattle, the ranch wants to maintain a squatty, short herd of
Herefords descended from those that roamed the Pedernales
pastureland in LBJ's time.
   In those days, said Buddy Hodges, chief of ranching, the
preferred Hereford build was ``short-legged, dumpy and plump.''
   Ranch foreman Edward Meier, who began working here when LBJ was
president, said Johnson didn't want his home to become a relic of
the past. However, Meier said, rebuilding ranch houses to make them
historically accurate would be easier than breeding cows in a fight
against advancing genetics.
   Every three years, a new bull must be introduced to avoid
inbreeding, but brings the risk of producing a herd that looks a
little less like the one LBJ admired.
   Texas A&amp;M University has been assisting the ranch in plans to
preserve its genetic pool, Meier said.
   The historically accurate breeders are attended to daily, and
are admired by thousands who snap their pictures and applaud the
antics of their offspring. At present, 23 babies cling to their
mamas along the winding route of the tourist tram. ``The visitors
get all excited,'' said Meier. ``You gotta admit, they are pretty
little buggers.''

   You might as well call Scarlett O'Hara a Yankee
as call a Soviet Georgian a Russian. And don't, please, circle your
thumb and forefinger to tell a Soviet Georgian that it's OK with
you.
   Those were among the tips for 300 U.S. Georgians who are
participating in the Friendship Force's largest single exchange of
citizens between the United States and the Soviet Union, a
Georgia-to-Georgia exchange April 17 to May 1.
   The U.S. participants in their first meeting Sunday at Clark
Atlanta University learned that it's the little things that count.
   For example, the circled thumb and forefinger gesture, which
means ``OK'' to a U.S. Georgian, is an obscene gesture in the
Soviet republic where Atlanta's sister city, Tbilisi, is the
capital.
   Women in slacks are frowned upon.
   The group also was told to expect much more hospitality from
their hosts than they are used to, especially in drinking and
making toasts. If they admire someone's painting or jewelry, it may
be given to them on the spot.
   Friendship Force officials reassured the group that the
political situation seems to be stable in Soviet Georgia, which is
one of several republics agitating for independence.
   Among noted U.S. Georgians participating are Rosalynn Carter's
mother, Allie Smith, Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson's daughter,
Valerie Amanda Jackson, and Atlanta entertainers Liz Spraggins and
Michael Cloud.

<HEAD>Sewage Dumped at Sea Poses Health Risks to Swimmers, Seafood
Lovers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sewage dumped at sea poses a significant health
risk to seafood lovers and swimmers who can pick up bacteria and
viruses, said an international report on the world's oceans
released Monday.
   The contaminated sewage can cause hepatitis, cholera, polio,
gastrointestinal illnesses and possibly AIDS, it said.
   Contrary to public fears, however, radioactive contamination of
the oceans remains ``extremely low'' and the oceans are not
threatened by oil pollution except at the sites of major spills,
the report said.
   The United Nations-sponsored report said coastal waters are the
most vulnerable and abused. They are threatened by contaminated
sewage, runaway coastal development and excess nutrients such as
phosphates and nitrates which are killing fish and altering plant
life.
   Professor Alasdair McIntyre of the University of Aberdeen in
Scotland, chairman of the 20-member panel that prepared the report,
rejected the theory that sunlight and waves quickly destroy
dangerous organisms in sewage.
   ``It used to be thought that a very short time in the sea killed
off these organisms, but we are having to recognize this is not the
case,'' he told a news conference.
   The report said eating contaminated seafood is firmly linked
with serious illness, including viral hepatitis and cholera and
that bathing in contaminated water could also cause illness.
   ``There are records of people contracting polio from swimming in
contaminated water,'' McIntyre said. He said a U.S. study showed
the polio virus could survive for 17 months in sewage-polluted
marine waters.
   Epidemiological studies in the United States and the
Mediterranean have also provided ``unequivocal evidence'' that
swimmers in sea water polluted with micro-organisms from feces have
a higher incidence of gastric disorders, the report said.
   ``The fact that viruses are known to survive for surprisingly
long periods is a significant development,'' he said.
   Asked about the AIDS virus, McIntyre said: ``Although the chance
of an AIDS virus surviving would be very slight, nevertheless it
could survive.''
   Last week, Patrick Gowen, a British marine biologist formerly at
the University of East Anglia, told a parliamentary committee that
new research showed the AIDS virus could live for more than 24
hours in sea water. He warned that swimmers could catch it through
cuts, sunburn sores and shingle scuffs.
   The World Health Organization dismissed the claim as ``total
nonsense.''
   The report by the Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of
Marine Pollution said human pollution was evident in the oceans
``from the poles to the tropics and from beaches to abyssal
depths.''
   The scientists said ``the open sea is still relatively clean''
but marine habitats and resources along the oceans' coasts were
being damaged irretrievably by harbor developments, industrial
installations, tourist facilities and saltwater fish farming.
   ``Although difficult to quantify, destruction of beaches, coral
reefs and wetlands, including mangrove forests, as well as
increasing erosion of the shore, are evident all over the world,''
the report said.
   The increasing flow of nitrates and phosphates to coastal
waters, mainly from sewage disposal and agricultural run-off, has
resulted in excessive plant growth which is choking some coastal
waters and killing fish, the report said.
   Without immediate international action, McIntyre said, ``there
is good reason to fear a significant deterioration in the marine
environment in the next decade.''
   The report said nuclear installations, fallout from
weapons-testing and more recently, from the accident at Chernobyl
in the Soviet Union, have added to radioactivity levels naturally
occurring in sea water.
   But it said the levels remain ``extremely low'' and ``these
additions have had insignificant effects on man and other
organisms.''

<TEXT>
   The former socialist mayor of Burlington
on Monday announced a new bid for Congress, and pledged not to
soften his rhetoric.
   ``I am what I am and what I have been for 20 years,'' Bernard
Sanders told reporters.
   Sanders, an independent hoping to improve his strong
second-place showing in the 1988 House race, said he decided to run
again for Congress rather than governor because of concern about
national and international issues.
   ``I can honestly say that there is no race that I have ever run
in which I feel more enthusiastic, more confident, and which has,
for me, a greater sense of urgency,'' said Sanders, who stepped
down in April after running Vermont's largest city for eight years.
   The 1988 race was won by Republican Peter Smith with 41 percent
of the vote. Sanders drew 38 percent, twice that for Democratic
nominee Paul Poirier.
   Sanders said he considers himself a socialist, but will again
run as an independent in the November election. Analysts say the
Democrats might not field a candidate, giving Sanders a head-on
contest against Smith.
   If elected, Sanders said he would strive to create a national
health care system, shift the burden of taxes away from workers and
the middle classes, cut in half defense spending in five years to
acknowledge radical changes in the Soviet bloc, and halt the
destruction of the environment.
   ``Politically, we need the courage to put the environment first
and corporate profits last,'' he said.

   The White House said Monday the victory of
East German conservatives in Sunday's elections bolsters the case
for keeping a united Germany in NATO.
   Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the elections were ``a
victory not only for the people'' of East Germany, ``but for all
Germans and all who support democratic values.''
   ``It does appear the march towards reunification is
inexorable,'' said the presidential spokesman.
   A conservative alliance linked with West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats won a large plurality on a
platform favoring rapid unification with West Germany.
   The United States has insisted that a reunited Germany remain in
the West's military alliance and Fitzwater said the balloting
showed support for the Western approach. ``Our policy, clearly, is
that a reunified Germany would be in NATO. Chancellor Kohl has
indicated that,'' he said. ``This victory ... would seem to lend
support for that direction as well.''
   The Soviet Union wants Germany to be neutral and reiterated
Monday that the new Germany must not be in NATO.
   ``That would upset the balance of Europe,'' Soviet Foreign
Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said in Moscow.
   ``We respect the expressed will of the citizens of East Germany,
an allied sovereign state,'' Gerasimov said. ``Respecting this
right of choice, we proceed from the premise that in turn, they
will respect the legitimate interests of the Soviet Union and other
countries.''
   Fitzwater, in a statement, said, ``We are pleased to note that
East Germany yesterday joined the growing list of nations that have
held free and fair elections. This is a victory not only for the
people of the German Democratic Republic, but for all Germans and
all who support democratic values.
   ``We have long supported the aspirations of the people of East
Germany in deciding their own future. We join them and the people
of the Federal Republic in celebrating this historic occasion.''
   Fitzwater, asked about possible obstacles to unification, said,
``It does appear that the march towards reunification is
inexorable. It seems clear that the elections have sent that
message.''
   The United States says NATO membership for Germany would help
safeguard the security of both East and West in Europe.
   Bush and Kohl met at Camp David, Md., Feb. 10-11 to discuss the
fast-moving changes that could lead to a single Germany by the end
of this year. West Germans vote in their own federal elections in
December.
   The conservative Alliance for Germany won 48.2 percent of the
vote and 193 of the 400 parliamentary seats in East Germans' first
free election since 1933. The Communists, who had ruled under a
dictatorship for the past 41 years, won just 16.3 percent of the
votes and 65 seats.
   The new government that forms in the next 30 days will take part
in unification talks with West Germany and the four chief World War
II victors, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the United
States.
   NATO is the 16-nation Western military alliance forged in the
1950s as a united defense against communist aggression. Its rival
Warsaw Pact has been shaken by the collapse of communist rule in
most East Bloc nations over the past year.

   The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate a
$550,000 award won, and then lost, by a Texas couple whose daughter
was born with deformities after her mother took the anti-nausea
drug Bendectin.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court
ruling that overturned a jury award against Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals, the drug's manufacturer.
   Mr. and Mrs. Floyd Brock of Moscow, Texas, sued Merrell Dow
after their daughter, Rachel, was born with deformed limbs in 1982.
   A three-member panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
last year threw out the $550,000 judgment a federal trial jury had
awarded the Brocks.
   The appeals court said there is no definitive scientific proof
that Bendectin causes birth defects, and said the jury award was
based on speculation.
   ``Speculation unconfirmed by ... proof cannot form the basis for
causation in a court of law,'' the appeals court said.
   The full 5th Circuit court, by a 8-6 vote, refused to review the
three-member panel's ruling.
   The dissenters noted that six experts testified for the Brocks
that Bendectin is capable of causing birth defects, and that three
testified they believed the drug caused Rachel's deformities.
   The dissenting judges said appellate courts should not
substitute their understanding of the facts for that of a jury
merely because medical experts disagree.
   Bendectin was marketed by Richardson-Merrell Inc. between 1957
and 1983. More than 30 million women used the drug during
pregnancy. Richardson-Merrell later became Merrell Dow, which last
July merged with Marion Laboratories Inc. and became Marion Merrell
Dow Inc., based in Kansas City.
   The company stopped selling Bendectin 1983, although the Federal
Drug Administration never has rescinded approval of it.
   Merrell Dow in 1984 agreed to pay $120 million to more than 800
families to compensate children with birth defects allegedly caused
by Bendectin. As part of the settlement, the corporation did not
admit that the drug caused the defects.
   The settlement was rejected by a federal appeals court, and the
lawsuits then went to a consolidated trial in Ohio, where Merrell
Dow has its headquarters in Hamilton County.
   After a 22-day trial in 1985, an Ohio jury found that Bendectin
did not cause birth defects when taken in prescribed doses.
   The case acted on today is Brock vs. Merrell Dow, 89-1189.

   The Supreme Court today refused to become
embroiled in a fight between environmentalists and the Bush
administration over Oregon timber and the northern spotted owl.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw out
part of a lawsuit seeking to protect the owl from the asserted
threat posed by logging operations in the old forests of westalership sentenced
under the law to six months
in prison.
   _ Refused to hear appeals stemming from a $200 million
settlement of price-fixing charges against the nation's leading
manufacturers of folding cartons.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that
redistributed a $6 million surplus from the settlement in one of
the biggest antitrust cases ever.
   _ Refused to hear a Bush administration appeal aimed at making
it costlier for an organization called the National Security
Archive to compile information.
   The archive is a non-profit organization that collects
information on national security and foreign policy and makes it
available to the public in various ways. It has filed thousands of
FOIA requests for government records.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that gives the
archive the same preferential status under the Freedom of
Information Act that other news media enjoy.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that about 1,500
breeding pairs of northern spotted owls remain, and that without
protection their numbers could be cut in half by the year 2050.
   The owl is being considered for inclusion on the federal
government's endangered species list.
   A coalition of environmental groups, including the various
Audubon Society chapters, the Wilderness Society, the Sierra Club
and the Natural Resources Defense Council, sued the Interior
Department in 1987 over timber-management plans for the western
Oregon forests.
   The lawsuit alleged that the department's Bureau of Land
Management had decided to continue logging old-growth timber
without adequately considering the detrimental effects to the
spotted owl population.
   The government's decision therefore was made in violation of
four federal laws _ the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA),
the Oregon and California Lands Act, the Federal Land Policy and
Management Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last September dismissed
that portion of the lawsuit alleging a NEPA violation, ruling that
Congress had precluded such a court challenge when it passed a 1988
appropriations bill for the Interior Department.
   The appeal acted on today argued that the appeals court wrongly
interpreted the 1988 legislation.
   The 9th Circuit court sent the lawsuit back to U.S. District
Judge Helen J. Frye in Oregon for consideration of the claims
raised under the three other environmental laws.
   While the case was pending before Frye, Congress last October
passed a 1990 appropriations bill dealing with timber production on
federal lands and protecting the northern spotted owl.
   The bill specifically states that the Bureau of Land
Management's consideration of logging effects on the owl ``is
adequate ... for the purpose of meeting the statutory requirements
that are the basis for'' the 1987 lawsuit.
   Judge Frey last Dec. 21 dismissed the lawsuit's remaining claims
``without prejudice to the filing of any new action challenging the
BLM owl management activities after fiscal year 1990.''
   An appeal in which the environmental groups are mounting a
constitutional attack against the 1990 appropriations bill is
pending in the 9th Circuit court.
   The case acted on today is Portland Audubon Society vs. Lujan,
89-931.

<HEAD>Question for Chicago Suburb's Voters: Art or Junk?</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Illinois Primary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERWYN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters in this Chicago suburb have a chance
to play art critics: They're being asked to give the thumbs up or
thumbs down to a 50-foot-tall stainless-steel shish kebab of eight
automobiles.
   A special referendum on Tuesday's ballot asks voters to decide
whether the massive $100,000 ``artistic construction,'' titled
``Spindle,'' and one known as ``Bil-Bored'' should be removed from
its display in a shopping plaza.
   The plaza's owner, David Bermant, says he's placed similar works
in the 20 shopping plazas he owns around the country, without any
of the fuss ``Spindle'' and ``Bil-Bored'' raised in Berwyn.
   Bermant, who splits his time between the East and West coasts,
acknowledges having been warned that his tastes in art might clash
with those of the conservative, middle-class suburb. But he
nonetheless professes astonishment at the criticism.
   ``I've just about had it with Berwyn,'' he said. ``I mean, I'm
really discouraged about Berwyn. Don't they have any sense of
aesthetics in Berwyn?''
   If they do, it apparently was offended by ``Spindle,'' erected
last year, and the 9-year-old ``Bil-Bored,'' an equally massive
assemblage of household goods, appliances and concrete.
   ```Bil-Bored' looks like a big pork chop filled with garbage ...
and `Spindle' is just more junk up our gazoos,'' state Republican
Sen. Judy Baar Topinka said at a recent hearing.
   Despite such caustic reviews, local officials lamented that
their options were limited.
   ``There is no law covering it,'' said Lawrence Zdarsky, Berwyn's
administrative coordinator. ``Building ordinances simply do not
forsee eight autos being piled on top of one another.
   ``What do you do? Ticket them?''
   Bermant and Berwyn officials eventually negotiated a solution _
an advisory referendum, along with some private polling by Bermant,
to determine just what residents think of the city's most prominent
works of art.
   Bermant cried foul after the ballots were printed because they
solicit a ``yes'' or ``no'' on the future of ``Spindle'' as well as
``Bil-Bored,'' though the tower of skewered automobiles has been in
place for only a few months. He also said he thought the vote would
come next fall, not this spring.
   ``You need 10 years to gain an understanding of art like this,''
he protested.
   ``But if the vote and my polls show the worst, that they really
hate it, then that's that, I've had it, I'll rip all the art out
and sell the whole damned shopping center,'' he said.
   ``It's really quite saleable, you know.''

<HEAD>UPI to Ask Appeals Court For Order in Picture Exchange Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Press International will ask an appeals
court on Tuesday to stop Reuters from backing out of a picture
exchange agreement between the two news services.
   UPI is seeking an injunction that was denied last week by U.S.
District Judge Peter K. Leisure, who ruled that UPI would not be
irreparably harmed if the contract were discontinued.
   Reuters had been ordered to continue the exchange until 5 p.m.
Monday. However, it said it would keep supplying UPI with pictures
from overseas until Tuesday's hearing before the 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
   The injunction request stems from a UPI counterclaim to a
Reuters' federal lawsuit that seeks to void the picture exchange.
Reuters says the agreement was not living up to expectations.
   The contract was entered into in 1984. It called for UPI to
supply Reuters with pictures from the United States, while Reuters
provided UPI with pictures from other countries. It was to run for
10 years beginning in 1985.
   UPI says it will lose clients if Reuters ends the agreement.

<HEAD>Attorneys General Suggest to Bush He Spend More on Drug War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush claimed progress Monday in the
war on drugs and asked a group of state attorneys general for
suggestions on how to do better. Some suggested he send more money.
   Bush agreed there was a need for additional federal support but
blamed Congress for dragging its feet on his anti-crime and
anti-drug efforts.
   ``We've gotten some of what we've asked for _ new agents, new
prosecutors, new prison space. ... But I must confess to a certain
frustration,'' he said.
   He told the National Association of Attorneys General that
recognition was important ``that this problem is national and that
nobody's going to make it by dealing just at the federal level.''
   ``I would ask your support, this much horsepower in town, to
work ... with us on getting this crime package through,'' Bush
said, speaking to attorneys general from 37 states.
   Bush said he sensed ``a certain turning around, at least in
terms of public opinion,'' on the issue of drugs, mentioning that
anti-drug messages are being worked into some Saturday morning
cartoon shows.
   ``Twenty million kids watch cartoons every Saturday,'' Bush
said. ``Now, that couldn't have happened if it hadn't been for the
focus that you all are putting on the drug problem.''
   Some of the attorneys general made a plea for more federal funds.
   Pennsylvania Attorney General Ernest D. Preate Jr. told
reporters that the money earmarked to help the states was not
enough.
   ``You can't fight a war against drugs unless you have the kind
of financial commitment that's necessary to put troops into the
field,'' Preate said.
   But national drug policy director William J. Bennett argued that
if Congress accepts the administration's proposal for spending
$10.6 billion on the drug effort in fiscal 1991 it will represent a
70 percent increase in funds over the 1989 level of $6 billion.
   ``No other federal program has seen that kind of increase,''
Bennett said. ``That's real money and it's going to make a
difference.''
   ``I don't object to people coming here and saying they need
more,'' Bennett added. ``They're going to get more. We'll be back
in future years for more. But let's not ignore what's been done.
What's been done is significant and substantial.''
   For one thing, Bennett said, ``there was a lot more drugs coming
into this country than previously thought.''
   Tom Miller, attorney general of Iowa and president of the
National Association of Attorneys General, said Bennett had
arranged to meet with state officials on the drug problem at a June
conference in Washington.

<TEXT>
   Robert H. Bork, who once hoped for a Supreme
Court seat, instead stood before the nation's highest court Monday.
   He was there in the capacity of a lawyer _ apparently making him
the first defeated Supreme Court nominee ever to argue before the
justices.
   Representing Citibank in a big-stakes battle, Bork argued that
U.S. banks with branch offices overseas should not be required to
pay depositors after foreign governments seize or freeze those
accounts.
   The Senate rejected Bork's nomination to the high court in 1987
after a bitter political battle. He was branded a conservative
extremist by opponents.
   Bork, nominated by then-President Reagan, has said he was the
victim of a campaign of lies and distortions led by liberals.
   There were no references to that fight Monday as Bork engaged in
debate with the justices and opposing lawyers over the complexities
of federal banking law and related matters.
   Bork was treated much the same as any attorney who appears
before the justices. They questioned him vigorously, occasionally
interrupting him for clarification and elaboration.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who occupies the seat that eluded
Bork, directed a few questions at Bork.
   Bork, 63, a former federal appeals court judge, is a fellow at
the American Enterprise Institute and will begin teaching
constitutional law in the fall at the George Mason University law
school in Arlington, Va.
   He will be paid $25,000 a year to teach one course each semester
as a part-time professor.
   Bork was only the sixth man this century to be denied a Supreme
Court seat by the Senate and the 26th in its history.

   The victorious Alliance for Germany said
Monday the German states must move more quickly to reunify, but its
leader was rebuffed as he began trying to form a coalition
government to move the process along.
   A more left-leaning party, the Social Democrats, turned down an
invitation to join the coalition, thus blocking the Alliance from
having a two-thirds majority in Parliment. Such a majority would
allow East Germany to simply declare a merger with the West.
   The three-party Alliance swept to victory Sunday in East
Germany's first free elections but did not win a majority in the
400-seat Parliament.
   The Alliance got a boost Monday from perhaps its biggest
supporter, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who promised
financial aid for East Germany.
   The chancellor had refused such aid to the Communists, who have
governed since hard-liner Erich Honecker was overthrown in the fall.
   Lothar de Maiziere, likely to be the next East German premier,
invited the Social Democrats and the Union of Free Democrats to
discuss forming a ``grand coalition'' to guide the nation toward
unification with the broadest possible consensus.
   He clearly was disappointed when Social Democratic leader
Ibrahim Boehme refused.
   ``Mr. Boehme must certainly have to ask himself what he meant in
the last few weeks when he repeatedly said our country's problems
are so big they must be carried on the broadest possible
shoulders,'' de Maiziere said.
   However, an alliance of centrist, liberal parties, which won 21
seats, was ready to negotiate joining in a coalition with the
Alliance, West Germany's ARD television said. That would give a de
Maiziere-led government 214 seats in Parliament.
   De Maiziere's Christian Democratic Union is one of three parties
comprising the Alliance. The party stresses traditional Christian
values and less government control of the economy, and
traditionally has been at odds with the Social Democrats, who
follow a leftist, socialist-oriented path.
   The Social Democrats said moving quickly to reunify could result
in a loss of East Germany's cradle-to-grave social services and
allow the country to be swallowed up by its wealthy neighbor.
   The party placed second in the vote, with 21.8 percent and 87
seats in Parliament. The Alliance won 48.2 percent and 193 seats.
   The Party of Democratic Socialism _ the former Communist Party _
placed third with 16.3 percent. It will have 12 seats in Parliament.
   De Maiziere held a round of meetings Monday with the goals of
forming a government and uniting with the West.
   ``Here, we will carry forward and step up the pace of the
already started negotiations,'' he said.
   He urged ``rapid introduction of a monetary, economic and social
union'' with West Germany. In a largely symbolic move, he said the
Berlin Wall should be torn down ``as soon as possible, as a clear
sign of the merging of the two German states.''
   The wall was opened Nov. 9 during the height of the
pro-democracy movement that made Sunday's vote possible. Large
pieces of it already have come down.
   The balloting marked the first free elections in East German
history and capped the country's transition to democracy after four
decades of iron-fisted Communist rule.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the vote was ``a
victory not only for the people'' of East Germany, ``but for all
Germans and all who support democratic values.''
   ``It does appear the march toward reunification is inexorable,''
he said.
   The new government will take part in unification talks with West
Germany and the four World War II Allies _ Britain, France, the
Soviet Union and the United States. A major obstacle is the
military alignment of a unified Germany.
   The Western powers want Germany to be part of NATO. The Soviets
and East German Communists have called for a neutral single state.
Both sides made clear Monday they have not changed their attitudes.
   ``Our policy, clearly, is that a reunified Germany would be in
NATO. Chancellor Kohl has indicated that. This victory ... would
seem to lend support for that direction as well,'' Fitzwater said.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said
putting the new Germany in NATO would upset the military balance of
Europe.
   ``We respect the expressed will of the citizens of East Germany,
an allied sovereign state,'' Gerasimov said. ``Respecting this
right of choice, we proceed from the premise that in turn, they
will respect the legitimate interests of the Soviet Union and other
countries.''
   Kohl's government is scheduled to decide Tuesday on ways to halt
the immigration of East Germans to his country. The exodus sparked
the fall revolution and has come to strain West Germany's social
services while crippling the East's economy.
   At a news conference in Bonn, Kohl said he stands behind his
promises of a financial bailout now that a democratically elected
government is about to take over. He did not give specifics.

   They borrowed a Broadway theater to celebrate
the 65th birthday of Luigi Faccuito, a long-time performer and
dance teacher whose students have included some of the top names of
the stage and screen.
   Several hundred friends and associates gathered for Sunday
night's tribute at the Helen Hayes Theater. Faccuito, known simply
as Luigi, was lured to the theater on the pretext of attending a
reading.
   Dozens of his students were on stage to greet him, playing out
the jazz dances that he is largely credited with developing.
   Actor Robert Morse, currently starring on Broadway in ``Tru,''
and Loni Ackerman of ``Cats,'' were co-hosts of the show.
Performers included actor Tony Roberts, opera singer Clamma Dale
and stage stars Gretchen Wyler, Donna McKechnie and Yvonne Constant.
   Roberts read a Happy Birthday letter. Gene Kelly, Joel Grey,
Liza Minnelli and Mayor David Dinkins sent messages. The office of
the president of the New York borough of Manhattan proclaimed March
21 ``Luigi Day'' in the borough.
   A deluge of congratulatory messages came from England, France,
Japan, Brazil, South Africa, West Germany, Canada and Mexico.
   The tribute took place three days before Luigi's actual birthday.
   Born Luigino Faccuito in Steubenville, Ohio, Luigi was involved
in a car crash while starting out his career in Hollywood in the
late 1940s, and was left partially paralyzed.
   Old photos, film clips and videotapes projected on a screen
traced his life from his early days when he displaced fellow
Steubenville native Dean Martin as a band singer through naval
service in World War II to his arrival in New York in 1965.
   The gathering saw clips of several films in which he danced,
mainly as an associate of Gene Kelly, including ``Gotta Dance,''
``Singin' In The Rain,'' and ``On The Town.''
   Miriam Fond, one of the organizers, said the hardest part was
keeping the party a secret from Luigi. The catch-phrase of the
evening was ``never stop movin,''' Luigi's constant exhortation to
students in class.
   In response to the accolades, Luigi told the gathering that his
mother had always said she prayed every day for her son and his
students, ``so if some of you made it, it's because of her.''

   Laborers hurried to finish platforms
and bleachers Monday as foreign dignitaries began arriving for the
celebrations to mark Namibia's passage from being Africa's last
colony to its youngest nation.
   About 5,000 foreign visitors, mostly diplomats and journalists,
are expected to join tens of thousands of Namibians to watch the
South African flag lowered in favor of Namibia's red, green and
blue banner.
   The event, which begins Tuesday and continues into Wednesday,
will end 75 years of South African rule. South Africa captured the
former German colony during World War I and for decades imposed the
same apartheid laws that separate blacks and whites in South Africa.
   United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar will be
present at Namibia's birth, along with South African President F.W.
de Klerk, South African blac leader Nelson Mandela, at least 10
African heads of state, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
and U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   On his arrival, de Cuellar said Namibian independence was a
major achievement for the United Nations. ``The world now speaks of
the Namibian model, in praise of the determination, restraint,
tolerance and political maturity of the Namibian people,'' he said
at the airport.
   Baker made no comment on arriving at the airport and he and his
party were whisked away in a convoy of cars.
   Wednesday's independence date was selected to mark the 30th
anniversary of the ``Sharpeville Massacre,'' when 69 unarmed
demonstrators were shot to death in South Africa while protesting
apartheid laws in a black township south of Johannesburg.
   ``March 21, 1960, is a day that people rose up against
apartheid,'' said Hifikepunye Pohamba, who will become the home
affairs minister in the new government. ``The day was chosen as a
sign of solidarity not only for the people of Namibia, but also
with the people of South Africa.''
   Pohamba is a member of the South-West Africa People's
Organization, the group that waged a 23-year war against South
African rule and captured 57 percent of the vote in November's
elections. SWAPO's long-time leader Sam Nujoma will become
Namibia's first president.
   South Africa agreed in December 1988 to grant independence to
Namibia under a regional peace treaty that also calls for Cuba to
witldraw its 50,000 soldiers from Marxist-ruled Angoa by mid-1991.
   Namibia for many years had the same laws of racial segregation
as South Africa, although most were scrapped in recent years and
the huge, arid territory of 1.3 million people has a more relaxed
atmosphere than South Africa.
   Pohamba said the new government intends to remove ``symbols of
colonial brutality'' such as the old police uniforms.
   ``We feel it an urgent necessity that all old uniforms be taken
off and all new uniforms be put on,'' Pohamba said.
   However, he said the new outfits for police and prison guards
were not ready yet. ``Circumstances beyond our control,'' he said
without elaborating.
   Laborers at several sites rushed to finish platforms and
bleachers, and foreign dignitaries began arriving for the
celebrations.
   Windhoek, Namibia's modern capital and largest city with 120,000
residents, has only a few hotels and is able to accommodate only a
fraction of the visitors. Private homes, apartments and railway
sleeper cars all have been rented out, although some visitors were
still searching for places to stay.
   The Windhoek airport, which usually handles about six flights a
day, must cope with some 200 planes Tuesday and Wednesday. Because
of a lack of space, the planes of visiting leaders have to be
parked in the neighboring countries of South Africa, Botswana,
Zimbabwe and Zambia.
   Preparations for independence have gone relatively smoothly so
far, but the new government could face its first political headache
the day it takes over.
   In the dusty central town of Rehoboth, where virtually all of
the residents are of mixed-race, leaders have refused to relinquish
the extensive local autonomy granted by South Africa under its
policy of ethnic-based governments.
   The new Constitution calls for a strong central government and
does not provide for local authority along racial or ethnic lines.
   Pohamba said SWAPO would be willing to negotiate, but that
Namibians ``will not tolerate anyone who wants to dismember the
territory of Namibia.''
   SWAPO, which was committed to socialism while in exile, speaks
more often of working with the white business community that
controls the mining, farming and fishing industries.
   Those industries, along wih South African aid, have made Namibia
one of the few African countries to achieve an annual per capita
income of $1,000.
   However, the country's wealth is disproportionately in the hands
of the 75,000 whites, who make up only 6 percent of the population,
and South African aid is ending.

<HEAD>FAA Sends $22 Billion Plan To Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration Monday sent Congress a
$22 billion, five-year plan for commercial aviation to be funded by
a new airport tax of up to $12 per roundtrip and 25 percent
increases in other aviation taxes.
   Federal Aviation Administrator James B. Busey said the
reauthorization bill would help meet the growing demand for
aviation, allow modernization of the FAA's air traffic control
system and increase aviation safety.
   Overall, it would boost federal funding for aviation projects 73
percent in the next five years, compared with the amount available
during the current five-year period.
   In addition to the plan for improvements, FAA expects to spend
between $22 billion and $24 billion on operations and maintenance
over the next five years, including salaries of air traffic
controllers, FAA budget officials said.
   The FAA reauthorization, which covers proposed capital
expenditures through fiscal 1995, is the first major legislation
proposed under the national transportation policy unveiled by
President Bush and Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner earlier
this month.
   The transportation policy asks users to pay more of the cost of
air, land and sea transportation systems and would shift some
taxing responsibilities away from the federal government to state
and local governments.
   The aviation plan calls for increases in some federal aviation
taxes, as well, although the administration makes a distinction
between ``user fees'' and taxes Bush has promised not to increase.
   A federal trust fund, which is collected from passenger and
shipper taxes, would pay 85 percent of FAA costs compared with 57
percent now.
   The fund would be bolstered by an increase in the passenger
ticket tax from 8 percent to 10 percent. Freight way bill fees
would be increased from 5 percent to 6 percent. The tax on aviation
gasoline would increase from 12 cents to 15 cents and on jet fuel
from 14 cents to 18 cents.
   ``I believe this administration has put forward a comprehensive
proposal to deal with aviation in the 1990s,'' Busey told a meeting
of airport officials after the plan was sent to Capitol Hill.
   If approved by Congress, the plan would allow airport taxes for
the first time since the early 1970s.
   The maximum initial tax would be $3 per departure, with
travelers who make connecting flights paying at no more than one
additional airport each way. The legislation would give the
transportation secretary power to increase the maximum tax after
fiscal 1991.
   After the first year, collection of the tax would automatically
decrease other federal funding available to airports, and some
smaller regional airports might elect not to levy the fee so it
would not reduce funding under the federal Airport Improvement
Program, said Mike Moffet, an FAA assistant administrator.
   Improvement funds that were freed up as a result of the ticket
tax _ each $1 in collections would reduce federal funds available
to an airport by 50 cents _ would go into a discretionary fund to
help airports that need additional money, Moffet said.
   If the nation's largest 45 airports impose the ticket tax,
collections are expected to total $1 billion a year, he said,
adding that the collections could be used to obtain bonds for about
$10 billion in airport projects over the five years.
   Federal funding for airport improvements would total $7.7
billion over five years _ a 28 percent increase over amounts made
available during the past five years.
   Other funds under the reauthorization program would include
$13.5 billion for facilities and equipment programs, a 130 percent
increase over the previous five years, and $970 million for
research and development, a 13 percent increase.
   The administration proposes to fund the programs primarily from
the trust fund, which is expected to have a $7.6 billion balance by
the end of fiscal 1990 on Sept. 30.
   The spending plan would decrease funds in the aviation trust
fund to about $3 billion by the end of the five-year period,
officials said.
   Officials in the aviation industry and some members of Congress
have criticized the build up of money in the trust fund, which they
say has been used to offset the federal deficit.

<HEAD>Private Economists Predict Interest Rates Should Begin Falling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interest rates have peaked and should start
falling during the spring, a group of private economists predicted
Monday.
   Members of the Shadow Open Market Committee said they believed a
variety of consumer and business loans would decline in coming
months, reflecting a sluggish economy and declining inflationary
pressures.
   The economists forecast that banks' prime lending rate, the
benchmark for many business and consumer loans, should drop from 10
percent to 9.5 percent or perhaps as low as 9 percent by summer.
   Fixed-rate mortgages, which are about 10.25 percent, will fall
to 9.8 percent by mid-year and remain below 10 percent for the rest
of 1990, the outlook predicted.
   Jerry Jordan, senior economist at First Interstate Bancorp of
Los Angeles who compiled the group's forecast, said that weakness
in the economy would encourage the Federal Reserve to loosen its
grip on credit in coming months.
   The panel forecast that the federal funds rate, a bellwether
interest rate for judging the impact of Fed actions, will dip from
8.25 percent down to 7.5 percent by mid-year.
   Various business and consumer rates have been rising since the
first of the year with the government's 30-year bond jumping from
an average of 7.9 percent in November and December to around 8.5
percent currently.
   Those rates should fall back to 8 percent, the economists
forecast, and remain there through 1991.
   The shadow committee was upbeat on the prospects that the
economy will be able to avoid a recession this year although the
forecast called for economic growth to remain sluggish, reflecting
previous credit-tightening on the part of the Federal Reserve.
   Inflation, which jumped sharply early in the year because of
severe winter weather, will begin moderating with consumer prices
expected to rise at a slower pace than in 1989.
   ``A soft landing has been achieved,'' Jordan said. ``The economy
is going to muddle through as inflation continues to unwind.''
   The shadow committee meets twice a year to assess actions of the
Federal Reserve whose chief policy-setting body, the Federal Open
Market Committee, will meet next week.
   The shadow committee is composed of monetary economists who
focus on the Fed's control over the money supply as a determining
factor in the economy's health.

   Sales of U.S. savings bonds totaled $652
million in February, bringing to $118.85 billion the value of bonds
including accrued interest held by the public, the Treasury
Department said Monday.
   Savings bond sales totaled $3.2 billion for the first five
months of fiscal 1990 _ a 6 percent decline from February 1989.
   Savings bonds earn interest at a rate of 6.98 percent when held
five years or longer.

<HEAD>Kohl Calls For Unified East-West European Economy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Monday a
unified European economy should include the Soviet bloc and a new
system for settling potential military conflicts.
   Kohl's comments came at the opening of an East-West security
conference that is to focus on the economic recovery of Eastern
European nations that have overthrown their Communist regimes in
the past year.
   The conference is the biggest gathering of East and West nations
since the opening of the Berlin Wall, and it came one day after
East Germans, in their first free elections, chose a government
that is likely to embrace Kohl's plan for a swift reunification of
the Germanys.
   Kohl called for European nations to form a security agency that
would mediate conflicts and another agency to verify arms control
agreements.
   ``We need an instrument that makes it possible to prevent
conflicts while they are still in the bud,'' Kohl told the
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The 35-nation
group includes the United States, Canada and all Eastern and
Western European nations except Albania.
   ``A European conflict center and a center for verifying arms
control agreements could be the first steps toward building up
comprehensive security structures in Europe,'' he said.
   He gave few details of the new security agencies, but said they
should be ``within the framework'' of the conference, which
includes the Soviet Union.
   Kohl, however, reiterated his opposition to neutrality for a
unified Germany and said the merged nation should continue to
belong to NATO. The Soviet Union is seeking neutrality for a united
Germany.
   Kohl also urged the West to help stabilize Eastern Europe's new
attempts at free-market economies and promote their integration
with the rest of Europe.
   He said he supports the idea of forging ``treaties of
association'' that would tighten economic ties between East and
West Europe.
   He also said the West should help create conditions for a
``pan-European economic area'' that would bring the economies of
Europe closer together.
   The East-West meeting in Bonn, which runs until April 11, will
include the participation of more than 600 business and government
officials from Eastern and Western Europe.

   Poland will get U.S. corn instead of butter as
initially announced under President Bush's $100 million food-aid
package, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager of the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said 173,225 metric tons of surplus
corn will be donated to Poland instead of the 10,000 tons of butter
originally specified.
   After the original agreement was approved, the Poles found
themselves with an exportable supply of butter, he said. So the
switch was made.
   ``The corn will be sold and the proceeds used to enhance
economic development, with an emphasis on the Polish agricultural
sector,'' Dickerson said.
   The 173,225 tons of corn _ equal to about 6.8 million bushels _
is owned by the department's Commodity Credit Corp. At recent
prices, the corn would have a U.S. farm value of about $16 million.

<HEAD>Libya Says Several People Detained in Chemical Plant Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libya has detained several people suspected of
setting fire to a chemical plant that U.S. officials said produced
poison gas, Libya's ambassador to Italy said Monday.
   Ambassador Rahman Shalgam said the blaze was apparently set by
``a member of the technical staff at the factory,'' the Italian
news agency ANSA reported.
   He said the person responsible will be ``executed in the same
place where the fire took place.''
   Shalgam did not say how many people were detained or give their
nationalities.
   He said the blaze caused ``damage of great proportions,'' and
U.S. officials said the plant is inoperable.
   But a French company disclosed Monday that photographs taken by
the European satellite Spot I show the plant was not destroyed.
   ``The principal structures of the Libyan chemical factory at
Rabta don't seem to have been touched, and there are no traces on
the ground ... of the existence of a fire,'' said Christian
Bernard, a spokesman for Spot Image.
   Except for black traces on the small buildings apparently used
for storage, ``it's like nothing happened at Rabta,'' said Bernard.
He said the small buildings appear to be 800 yards from the main
plant. The photographs were taken Sunday.
   The blaze broke out Wednesday in the plant in Rabta, about 60
miles southwest of Tripoli. Libya said the factory produces
medicines, but the United States and West Germany have alleged it
produces poison gas.
   Libya has said it suspects that Israel, the United States and
West Germany were behind the fire. All three countries have denied
involvement.
   Shalgam said West Germany is under suspicion because West German
firms helped build the plant and would have its techncial plans,
Italian news agencies reported.
   ``It was a very dangerous attack which perhaps is part of a
program of sabotage, of which we don't even know the dimensions,''
he was quoted as saying.
   The blaze occurred shortly after the United States and West
Germany called for the Rabta plant to be shut down.
   Before the fire, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater had
refused to rule out a U.S. military strike to close it.

<TEXT>
   Riot police guarded banks and
supermarkets Monday as Brazilians began to adjust to radical
economic reforms that included a new currency and an 18-month
partial freeze on savings accounts.
   The measures were announced Friday by President Fernando Collor
de Mello to fight rampant inflation that has soared as high as
2,700 percent.
   Across the country, most banks opened two hours late to adapt to
the new rules, and Brazil's stock market, which also opened late,
reported no transactions during its half-day of trading.
   In Rio, state police in riot gear kept order in the downtown
financial district as huge lines formed at banks opening for the
first time since a three-day enforced holiday was declared. The
banks were closed Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.
   Under the vigilance of federal police, supermarkets began to
lower prices to meet government limits. Prices shot up by as much
as 200 percent last week in anticipation of a freeze, but the new
economic plan rolled back prices to last Monday's levels and set
maximum prices for 103 staples, ranging from beef and eggs to
matches and toothpaste.
   Looters attacked five supermarkets in Rio's poor northern zone
over the weekend, but no violence was reported Monday.
   Brazil's radical economic plan was designed to stabilize the
economy and bring down inflation that reached 2,700 percent in the
past year.
   ``Our hope was being taken from us,'' Collor de Mello said
Sunday night. ``This is our last chance.''
   Collor de Mello, 40, took office Thursday as Brazil's first
democratically elected president in 29 years.
   The most severe measure was a freeze on bank deposits that
totaled $115 billion _ the size of Brazil's foreign debt, the Third
World's largest.
   Savers can withdraw the equivalent of $1,200. Brazilians with
deposits in the $60 billion short term financial market can take
out half that amount after paying a tax.
   The rest will be frozen for 18 months, receiving corrections for
inflation and 6 percent yearly interest.
   ``The government has confiscated the money of the people after
promising that it would not alter the rules of the game regarding
savings accounts,'' said Francisco Gugael, a Sao Paulo lawyer, as
he stood in line outside a bank. ``Collor and his economy minister
have lost all their credibility.''
   The new president defended his package and said it wouldn't hurt
the poor.
   ``In the study we made, 90 percent of savings accounts are under
that limit.'' Collor de Mello said. ``We had to hit those accounts
because the big speculators were turning there.''
   Other measures included the elimination of federal subsidies, a
lowering of trade barriers and import restrictions, sharp increases
in taxes and utility rates, a floating exchange rate and the
abolition of 24 state companies and agencies.
   On Sunday, Collor de Mello said courts won't be allowed to issue
restraining orders to block the reforms.
   Opposition parties were to discuss the reforms Monday. Most of
the measures must be approved by Congress with 30 days, although
the president can submit a new 30-day decree.

<TEXT>
   A retired Army brigadier general and a former
Air Force colonel joined with the National Organization for Women
on Monday in supporting a bill to open Army combat jobs to women
for a four-year trial period.
   ``If we do have a test within the Army, I think finally there
will be documentation to prove that women can perform as
competently as men in the infantry and other combat areas,''
retired Brig. Gen. Evelyn Foote told reporters at a Capitol Hill
news conference.
   The Combat Exclusion Act, approved by Congress in 1948, bars
women in the Air Force, the Marines Corps and the Navy from serving
in combat positions. The Army has regulations similar to the law.
   Women comprise about 11 percent of the total armed forces of 2.1
million.
   The call for a reexamination of the policy has grown louder
since Army Capt. Linda Bray led troops into combat with Panamanian
forces during the U.S. invasion last December.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo. and a senior member of the
House Armed Services Committee, proposed legislation in January
that directs the Army to conduct a test study allowing women
assignment to combat positions.
   The legislation faces an uphill fight in Congress, where many
members still oppose opening combat jobs to women. Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wis. and chairman of the House Armed Services panel, has said the
measure will not be part of the overall defense bill.
   Nevertheless, officials of NOW, Foote and retired Col. Diane
Ordes called for a change in policy starting with passage of
Schroeder's legislation.
   Standing in front of a photo of enlisted men marching down the
capital's Constitution Avenue, Foote described her nearly three
decades of military service and how close she came to combat in
Vietnam in 1967.
   Ordes noted that eight women died in the Vietnam War and that
their names are engraved on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial a few
blocks from the Capitol.
   ``Women have been in combat ... since this nation was born.
Women have not been called combatants but they have been in
combat,'' Ordes said.
   Molly Yard, president of NOW, said the exclusion of women from
combat ``is based on archaic ideas of what women and men should and
should not do.''
   Yard, who is scheduled to testify Tuesday at hearings on the
issue, said the inability of women in the military to accept combat
positions limits their advancement in the service.

   The White House said Monday that the roster of
President Bush's ``thousand points of light'' is approaching the
hundred mark.
   The White House on Monday named Bush's 94th daily ``point of
light'' _ Jesse Sanchez Berain of Boise, Idaho, honored for helping
migrant workers and their children.
   Bush began naming points of light Nov. 22 to encourage
volunteerism. He intends to name 1,000 _ reflecting the ``thousand
points of light'' theme first struck in his acceptance speech in
August 1988 at the Republican convention.
   The White House Office of National Service released advance
copies Monday of a booklet with thumbnail sketches of Berain and
his 99 fellow points of light.
   Asked if it was an attempt to generate more publicity, White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``Actually, we're getting
very good publicity. ... We have stacks of clippings from around
the country.''
   ``Citizens and communities are starting to pick up on this
program, developing private organizations. So it's working very
well. We're very proud of it,'' he said.
   Bush has asked Congress for $25 million for a quasi-private
Points of Light Foundation that Bush would chair to spearhead
further voluntary activities.
   Berain, himself a farm worker as a child, helped found groups
called IMAGE de Idaho and CAMP, College Assistance for Migrant
People, to encourage Hispanic youths to stay in school and avoid
drugs.
   The daily point of light get a signed letter from Bush.

<TEXT>
   President Bush could grant the Soviet Union
``most-favored nation'' trading status at the July economic summit
in Houston if the Soviets enact legislation permitting free
emigration, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said Monday.
   Bush announced at his Malta summit meeting with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev last December the United States would begin
negotiating a trade agreement with the Soviets wiping away nearly
half a century of trade friction.
   The package would include granting most-favored nation trading
status, qualifying the Soviet Union for the lowest tariffs
available to American trading partners. Soviet exports into the
United States currently bear duties as much as 10 times higher than
imports from other nations.
   However, Bush first must waive the Jackson-Vanik Amendment
barring such status, which Congress passed in 1974 because of
Soviet refusal to allow free emigration. A waiver would require
Bush to certify to Congress that free emigration was being allowed.
   In a speech to the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith,
Mosbacher said Soviet enactment and implementation of
free-emigration legislation is expected this spring.
   ``Passage and implementation of such a law would mean that a
Jackson-Vanik waiver could be signed sometime this summer _ in
July, in Houston, Texas,'' Mosbacher said.
   Bush and other leaders of the Group of Seven plan to hold their
next economic summit July 9-11 in Houston. Other members are
Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan and West Germany.
   The economic meeting will follow the next summit meeting between
Bush and Gorbachev, probably in Washington during the last two
weeks in June. The exact dates have not been announced.
   U.S.-Soviet negotiators hope to reach agreement on the overall
trade package in time for the Bush-Gorbachev summit. The first
round of talks were held last month and both sides expressed
satisfaction with their progress. A second round was held later in
February in London and a third round is scheduled this month in
Vienna.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haiti's new civilian government
swore in 13 Cabinet ministers Monday, including human rights
activist Joseph Maxi as interior minister and retired army Col.
Jean Thomas as defense chief, independent Radio Haiti Inter
reported.
   Under the military regime of deposed ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper
Avril, defense and interior were combined into one ministry. The
caretaker government of President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot split the
ministry to avoid a concentration of power.
   Maxi was in hiding until recently after being implicated by the
Avril government last November in an alleged plot to overthrow it.
He has been president of the Human Rights League since the group's
previous president, Joseph Lafontant, was assassinated in July 1988.
   Thomas, a former diplomat, retired from the army last year. He
was regarded as an opponent of Avril even while serving in the
military.
   No current army officers are represented in the government.
   Pierre Labissiere, president of the Haiti Bar Association and a
prominent liberal, is the new justice minister.
   Haiti Inter identified the 10 other ministers as: Kessler
Clermont, foreign relations; Charles Tardieu, education; Lionel
Richard, agriculture; Carlo Desinor, information; Leslie Goutier,
finance; Jean-Pierre Moise, public works; Claudette Werleigh,
social affairs; Maurice Lafortune, commerce; Ludovic Pierre,
planning; and Serge Fils-Aime, health.
   The ministers were appointed by Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot and
approved by a civilian State Council that has veto power over her
decisions.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, a Supreme Court judge and Haiti's first
woman president, was inaugurated on March 13, one day after Avril
fled into exile in the United States following a popular uprising.
   She is to govern until elections can be held, possibly within
three to six months.

<HEAD>Soviet Official Confident About Reopening Angolan Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet foreign minister said Monday he
is confident that Angola's Marxist government can soon reopen peace
talks with the U.S.-backed rebels it has been battling for 15 years.
   Eduard A. Shevardnadze made his comments before ending a 24-hour
visit to this country during the first trip to sub-Saharan Africa
by a Soviet chief of diplomacy.
   ``Given the dynamic and rapid changes'' in the world recently,
``it shouldn't be impossible'' to start renewed direct peace
negotiations in the coming months, Shevardnadze told reporters
after a two-hour meeting with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
   He said a final peace accord could be signed by the time Cuba
completes the scheduled withdrawal of its estimated 50,000 troops
from Angola by July 1, 1991.
   Despite Shevardnadze's remarks, hopes for a quick peace seem
faint. Earlier peace talks and a June truce have collapsed, and
fighting has intensified since the government launched an offensive
in December.
   Western diplomats here, noting the recent warming of U.S.-Soviet
relations, are expecting the superpowers to put more pressure on
the Angolan adversaries to come to peace.
   Shevardnadze left Angola later Monday for the Zambian capital,
Lusaka. The official Angolan news agency ANGOP reported he will
also visit Zimbabwe, Namibia, Tanzania and Nigeria.
   The Soviet diplomat stressed the Kremlin supports dos Santos'
attempts to negotiate with Jonas Savimbi, the rebel leader.
Shevardnadze said he was confident a new nine-point plan drawn up
by the Luanda government would open the way to new direct talks
with the rebels.
   He gave no further details on that plan. But he said the Angolan
question would be high on the agenda at a planned meeting with U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III at Namibian independence
celebrations Tuesday. Namibia has been controlled by neighboring
South Africa.
   Late Sunday, Foreign Minister Pedro de Castro van Dunem of
Angola launched another attack on continued U.S. aid to the rebels.
   UNITA, or the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola, reportedly receives $50 million or more in annual U.S. aid.
   The rebels have been fighting to force a power-sharing agreement
since shortly after Angola gained independence from Portugal in
1975.
   U.S. officials have pledged support as long as Moscow supplies
arms to the Marxist government.

<HEAD>Farm Income Prospects Improved</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prospects for farm income have improved from
earlier 1990 economic forecasts, an Agriculture Department report
showed Monday.
   ``Combined with continuing strong demand for agricultural
products, currently higher prices due to tighter corn stocks and
smaller hog inventories have brightened the outlook,'' the report
said.
   Analysts also said that the bulk of federal payments, which
figure prominently in annual farm income statistics, continue to go
to a relative handful of larger farming operations.
   Overall, the net cash income of farmers was forecast at $54
billion to $58 billion this year, up from $53 billion in 1989. The
record was $57.2 billion in 1988. Previously, the department's
Economic Research Service had put 1990 income in the range of $52
billion to $57 billion.
   As used by the agency, net cash income ``measures the value of
commodities sold in a calendar year plus government payments, less
out-of-pocket costs.'' Commodities sold may actually have been
produced in earlier years and stored until marketed.
   In another method of accounting, the report said net farm income
is expected to be in the range of $45 billion to $49 billion,
steady to down 8 percent from last year's $49 billion. Previously,
it was forecast at $44 billion to $49 billion.
   Economists use net farm income to measure the value of
agricultural production _ whether sold or stored _ in a calendar
year plus government payments, minus all costs, including
depreciation and other factors.
   ``Net farm income may drop as feed grain prices ease from the
spikes caused by the 1988 drought,'' the report said. ``The lower
prices will dampen the value of the fall harvest. Much of the fall
1990 harvest will be sold in 1991.''
   The report said an analysis of USDA's 1988 Farm Costs and
Returns Survey showed that direct payments to farmers have been
``distributed on the basis of production'' as prescribed by current
farm law.
   ``Of farms receiving direct government payments, 32 percent
received 90 percent of the payments,'' the report said. ``Since 64
percent of all farm receive no direct payments, 90 percent of the
payments go to only 12 percent of all farms.''
   Greg Gajewski, senior editor of the report, said there was no
surprise in the breakdown of federal subsidies and that the pattern
fit the trend.
   Direct federal payments to farmers peaked at about $16.7 billion
in 1987, according to the agency, then dropped to $14.5 billion in
1988 and to around $11 million in 1989 as market prices improved,
thus reducing many of the subsidy rates. A further reduction to as
low as $8 billion is expected this year.
   The report also said that ``improved weather has brightened
prospects'' for the U.S. winter wheat crop.
   ``Early indicators in Western Europe, Canada and Australia point
to wheat production gains there as well,'' the report said. ``Wheat
prices are falling.''
   In Asia, a bumper 1989-90 rice crop is being harvested, with
record or near-record output forecast for China, Bangladesh,
Vietnam, Thailand and India.
   ``But U.S. stocks are low, and the Thais are holding stocks back
for sale later in the year,'' the report added. ``So, prices remain
strong and U.S. exports are slowing.''

   Leaders of the Organization of African
Unity met here Monday and urged African states not to resume
diplomatic relations with South Africa until further reforms are
made to end racial segregation.
   The 50-member Organization of African Unity's ad hoc committee
on southern Africa also warned governments that easing their
sanctions against South Africa would slow reforms.
   But the delegates agreed to encourage the black-led African
National Congress to pursue power-sharing talks with the white-led
government.
   South Africa's President F.W. de Klerk said he will hold talks
with the ANC April 11 as a prelude to formal negotiations on
power-sharing.
   De Klerk legalized the ANC and freed its leader, Nelson Mandela,
in February to pave the way for talks.
   ``The euphoria that has developed ... has led some leaders in
Africa and abroad to think that all is over in South Africa and
they are entitled to re-establish contact with the regime,'' ANC
secretary-general Alfred Nzo said.
   ``If this happens it is a signal to de Klerk to block any
further progress,'' he added.
   Zambia's President Kenneth Kaunda welcomed the release of
Mandela, but said Pretoria should do more to pave the way for
formal constitutional talks.
   ``It is the Pretoria regime that should unlock the gates to
negotiations,'' he said.
   It was the first summit meeting since the committee met in the
Zimbabwe capital Harare last August to endorse an ANC plan for
talks with South Africa.

   The head of NASA's space flight program
acknowledged Monday that repair and maintenance problems exist in
the planned space station but said they can be fixed by design
changes long before the station is built.
   ``I'm not worried about it,'' said Bill Lenoir, the space
agency's associate administrator for space flight. ``It's one of
many things at this point in the design that is inherently fuzzy.''
   A report in Monday's New York Times said NASA discovered
belatedly that the station, planned for assembly beginning in 1995,
would require about 2,200 hours of maintenance each year by
astronauts working in the hazardous open space environment.
   Lenoir said a more realistic _ but still inflated _ estimate is
550 hours, which he also considers too much.
   ``At this point, admittedly, we don't understand in depth the
reliability of the subsystems and pieces of subsystems,'' he said
in an interview. ``So we've made some unrealistic assumptions like
`everything that can fail will fail' and it will fail once a year.
   ``Then we multiply it all together and say, `well, gee, that's
550 hours.' We know that's harsh and probably higher than realistic
and that's what we'll be spending between now and December working
on,'' Lenoir said. The figure is exaggerated even more, he said, by
being multiplied by four to 2,200 hours.
   The Times said NASA investigators discovered ``the setback''
early this year, but Lenoir said it has been an issue that's been
worked on for six months and part of a preliminary design process
that will continue until a review in December.
   ``We've taken this quick and dirty bottoms-up assessment and now
we are going to dig in item-by-item and say what's the real
requirement and how will we deal with it,'' Lenoir said.
   ``I wouldn't say I'm not worried about it, but I'm worried about
it no more than anything else. I'm paid to worry about everything.''
   The newspaper's report said there were 5,578 parts outside the
station's inhabited modules that could be replaced if they failed
and that those calculations increased the work load by 30 percent.
   Lenoir said maintenance and repair of any such items can be
planned in four ways:
   ``I can live with it, I can do it robotically, I can make it
require less (maintenance) by upping its reliability, or I can move
it inside (the pressurized living module) so it becomes an
intravehicular rather than an extravehicular job.''
   Lenoir said it would be wrong to think the space station has a
major problem ``when in fact we have a minor problem, business as
usual, we are working on it and we are on schedule for coping with
it.''

   The man who may decide who will head Israel's
new government is an unlikely kingmaker, a 69-year-old rabbi better
known for his torah scholarship than foreign policy.
   Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, spiritual leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas
Party, made his power felt earlier when he put aside his daily task
of guiding his flock and advised Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to
accept U.S.-backed peace proposals.
   Shamir said no, and Yosef then used his spiritual authority to
topple Shamir's government by withholding the parliamentary votes
of his Shas Party last Thursday.
   Yosef's views angered his mostly right-wing followers _ many of
whom back Shamir's Likud party _ and a few ran into his Jerusalem
synagogue shouting ``Traitor!''
   A tug-of-war followed in Shas, and the pressure produced an
apparent turnaround in the party's support for Labor. Still,
Yosef's strong views on peace could decide whether Shas backs Labor
or Likud.
   In a rare television appearance Sunday, Yosef argued that he
toppled Shamir's government because it could not make peace.
   ``You are inviting war if you support such a government,'' Yosef
said, dressed in traditional dark robes with gold embroidery and
sunglasses he needs to wear to protect his sensitive eyes.
   He called Shamir's government ``the extremist of extremes'' and
argued that ``it would not have been able to give a positive
reply'' to the U.S. plan for the first open dialogue ever between
an Israeli government and Palestinians.
   ``What would the nations of the world say then? `These Israelis
don't want peace, they want war,''' Yosef said. ``And afterward,
when, God forbid, all the Arab states will rise up and make war
against us ... how many will be killed? Who will account for the
spilled blood?''
   Yosef is an Israeli former chief rabbi of Sephardic Jews, those
of Middle East or North African origin who now constitute a
majority in Israel.
   Born in Baghdad, Iraq's capital, he served as deputy chief rabbi
of Egypt before moving to Israel. Here he was a religious court
judge, author of studies of Jewish religious writings and founder
in 1984 of Shas, an acronym for the Sephardic Torah Guardians.
   He created the party in reaction to what was perceived as
discrimination against religious Sephardic Jews by the
ultra-Orthodox religious establishment, which was dominated by
Ashkenazis, or European Jews.
   Shas quickly gained support among secular Sephardis as well.
Today, with six seats, it is the third largest party in the
120-seat Knesset, or parliament. Three other religious parties
control 12 seats.
   Sephardic Jews comprise roughly 55 percent of Israel's Jewish
population. They generally are poorer and more conservative than
Ashkenazi Jews. Their overwhelming support enabled the Likud to end
29 years of rule by the center-left Labor Party in 1977.
   But since the 27-month-old intefadeh, or Palestinian uprising,
has made peace a more urgent concern, Yosef and some other
Sephardic leaders have surprised their flock with moderate
statements.
   First Yosef, on a festive homecoming to Egypt last summer,
declared that he believed the religious commandment to prevent
bloodshed superseded Israel's right to the occupied territories.
   Then a few months ago, another Sephardic spiritual leader,
``Baba'' Baruch Abuhatzeira, went further and advocated talks with
the Palestine Liberation Organization, which Israel views as a
terrorist organization.
   Both Sephardic and Ashkenazi spiritual leaders have generally
exhibited concern primarily for matters of immediate interest to
their flocks _ funding for religious schools and housing and
demands to pass legislation favorable to religion.
   That is why it was surprising Yosef got involved in the larger
political question of how Israel should make peace with the Arabs.

<HEAD>U.S. Plans $32 Million Aid to Contras Who Give Up Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. aid to relocate Contra rebels into their
Nicaraguan homeland will go only to fighters who agree to lay down
their arms, Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson said
Monday.
   ``This package ... is meant to provide a new livelihood for
unarmed resistance members who return peacefully to Nicaragua,''
Aronson said in testimony supporting President Bush's request for
$300 million to aid Nicaragua this year.
   The aid package includes about $32 million to pay costs of
moving rebel fighters and their families back into Nicaragua, and
could cover the costs of items like seed, fertilizer and tools to
get them started in farming.
   Rep. Matthew McHugh, D-N.Y., a member of the House
Appropriations foreign operations subcommittee, voiced concern over
reports that armed rebels have infiltrated into the country from
their camps along the Honduran border and are demanding that
enclaves be established where they can remain with their weapons.
   ``There is a certain degree of skepticism out in the country and
in Congress'' over the intentions of the rebels, said McHugh, a
consistent opponent of the past U.S. policy of financing the
Contras.
   He called Contra demobilization ``the most serious potential
problem for the transfer of power'' from the leftist Sandinista
government to the opposition coalition led by Violeta Chamorro, who
won the Feb. 25 election.
   Aronson said the administration believes ``it's time for the
combatants to put their arms down and go back to civic life'' but
added, ``There's no button to push ... and 10 years of fears on
both sides.''
   One option for easing the rebels back is to establish
``enclaves'' in the Nicaraguan countryside where the rebels could
congregate, with United Nations peacekeeping troops around them as
a buffer to separate them from Sandinista soldiers, Aronson said.
   The UN is contemplating expanding its peacekeeping force by as
many as 800 men, he said. But it was unclear whether Contras would
be required to forfeit their weapons before entering Nicaragua, or
only after arriving in the enclaves, he added.
   ``There is jockeying on both sides,'' Aronson told the
subcommittee.
   He said plans are also under consideration to establish a
church-run verification network in rural Nicaragua which would
report any instance of harassment or abuse of returning rebels.
   Relocation aid is an important element of the plan, he said.
``In exchange for having given up a weapon, we don't want to turn
them loose in a devastated area with no way to support seven or
eight kids,'' Aronson said.

<TEXT>
   The democratic opposition groups
that successfully demanded the ouster of Communist Party chief
Jambyn Batmonh put up posters on Monday supporting him as president.
   The posters urged Ulan Bator residents to rally Tuesday
afternoon in Sukh-Bator square in the city center on the eve of a
legislative session expected to replace Batmonh as president.
   The ruling Communist Party, meanwhile, said its Central
Committee would meet Tuesday for a second time in two weeks to
discuss restructuring the party in the face of growing popular
pressure.
   The party has ruled since 1921, when it came to power in a
Soviet-backed revolution. The sparsely populated Kremlin satellite,
sandwiched between China and the Soviet Union, allows Red Army
troops to be based on its soil.
   The opposition groups, which sprang up the past four months to
end the Communists' monopoly on politics, won Batmonh's ouster as
party general secretary last week after repeated demonstrations in
the square.
   A veteran party member tied less closely to Mongolia's past
dictatorial leadership, Gombogavyn Ochirbat, replaced him, and a
new Politburo and Secretariat were named.
   The opposition said it wanted a new communist leadership because
the old one had failed to keep promises to move toward democracy
and shake up the inefficient planned economy. However, opposition
activists said Batmonh was an honest man who they trusted to
continue as president in what they consider as a transitional
period to full democracy.
   ``If someone more conservative is elected ... he might stop the
democracy movement,'' said a member of the opposition.
   In multiparty talks, which began nearly two weeks ago, the
ruling Communist Party agreed Batmonh would resign as party chief
but stay on as president. The opposition was surprised and upset
when Batmonh offered his resignation as president last week.
   Delegates to the legislature, called the Great People's Hural,
said they expect to accept Batmonh's resignation.
   ``Batmonh was replaced in his party post. It would not be
suitable for such a person to be president,'' said Erdene, a
36-year-old worker and deputy from Darhan City.
   However, he and other delegates agreed that the new reformist
notion of separating party and state should be observed and
Ochirbat should not be chosen president.
   None of the delegates was able to suggest a replacement for
Batmonh. They said they expected to retain Dumaagiyn Sodnom as
prime minsiter. Sodman was a member of the ousted party Politburo
and also offered to resign his state post.
   Delegates to the Communist-dominated 370-seat Hural began
arriving in Ulan Bator on Monday for its annual session, which
begins Wednesday and is expected to last four days.
   Many climbed off buses at the Hotel Ulan Bator wearing labor
hero medals and small pins of the national flag on their
traditional nomads' garb.
   ``This is the peak season in breeding livestock. They are giving
birth and there is so much work waiting for us,'' said Ikhlas, a
55-year-old herdsmen from western Mongolia.
   But, he said, the session is important because it will debate
and probably approve a law providing for multiparty elections.
   Legislative elections are not due until next year and the
Communists say they are confident they will win. Hural delegates
seemed unenthusiastic about the opposition demands for early
elections this year.
   ``I support the current deputies,'' Ikhlas said.
   Dolgormaa, a woman teacher from southern Mongolia, said
opposition parties should be allowed Hural seats if they work with
the Communists.
   ``But if the opposition parties are in conflict with the ruling
party and are demanding and aggressive, then I will not support
it,'' she said.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Monday the
administration has cut the Pentagon budget ``as far as we can
responsibly go,'' as the White House denied a report that President
Bush could accept a major cut in military spending.
   Cheney said in a speech that the administration had made ``real
cuts'' in its $307 billion military spending plan for 1991 that
respond ``directly and rationally'' to the changes in Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater rejected a report
that the administration could accept cutting the Pentagon budget by
$11 billion.
   ``Our position is that we have proposed a budget that calls for
something like $3.9 billion in cuts. We intend to stick with that
proposal,'' Fitzwater said.
   The New York Times reported Sunday the administration is willing
to accept a $10 billion to $11 billion cut in fiscal 1991 military
spending, in response to pressure from Capitol Hill for even more
severe reductions.
   ``There is not a $10- or $12 billion cut ... that we are
prepared to accept,'' Fitzwater said. However, the spokesman added,
``Every number's negotiable.''
   ``We believe adequate national security is based on the $3.9
million cut. That's the one that we proposed,'' he said.
   For the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, the administration has
requested $307 billion in budget authority and $303 billion in
outlays for the Defense Department, the Department of Energy and
military construction projects.
   The administration's request, although higher than last year, is
two percent below the level required to keep up with inflation.
   But some members of Congress, with an eye to the developments in
the Soviet Union and Europe amid economic presssures at home, are
pressing for heftier cuts.
   Cheney, in a speech to the American Defense Preparedness
Association, acknowledged the relationship between the superpowers
``clearly has taken a turn for the better'' and ``the threat of a
sudden, Soviet invasion of Western Europe clearly has receded.''
   But he argued ``great uncertainty'' remains about the course of
reform in the Soviet Union, and the Soviets retain ``enormous
military capabilities,'' particularly in strategic nuclear weapons
systems.
   Cheney's view has clashed with the more sanguine public view CIA
Director William Webster has taken of the potential Soviet military
threat. Cheney said Monday that ``my job calls for me to err on the
side of caution.''
   ``It would be irresponsible of me ... to run out and focus only
on the good news,'' he said.
   Even so, Cheney said, the Pentagon has cut its projections for
spending over the upcoming five-year period ``by $231 billion''
during his past year in office.
   ``By March of 1995, defense spending will be down to the lowest
share of GNP since before World War II. These are real cuts, they
are big, and they relate directly and rationally to the reduced
threat. But these cuts are as far as we can responsibly go,''
Cheney said.
   The former congressman from Wyoming accused his former
colleagues on Capitol Hill of having a ``memory lapse'' in
demanding steep defense cuts, because they rejected his proposals
for killing such programs as the V-22 Osprey tilt-roter plane and
the F-14D jet fighter last year.
   ``The resistance (to cuts) we keep running into is right up
there on Capitol Hill _ with those folks who say they want me to
cut the defense budget. But of course they don't want me to close
any bases, shut down any production lines, or do anything that
maight have an impact on somebody's base back home on the
district,'' Cheney said.
   In his speech, the defense secretary also said he and Bush
``want to keep moving forward as fast as we possibly can'' on the
Strategic Defense Initiative.

   The government offered a $100,000 reward Monday for the capture
of the bomber who destroyed a Drug Enforcement Administration
office in Fort Myers, Fla., but the agency concedes it can do
little to prevent future attacks.
   The FBI has issued a nationwide alert for Jeffrey A. Matthews,
23, an elusive drug suspect who allegedly threatened the DEA after
his indictment Thursday.
   ``There have been no warrants issued yet for anyone in the
explosion, but we are following some good leads,'' FBI spokesman
Brian Kenscel said.
   The DEA and FBI jointly announced the $100,000 reward for
information leading to the arrest and conviction of the bomber or
bombers, but they did not name a suspect.
   Matthews' half-brother, John Lewis Ciganek, 22, surrendered to
authorities Sunday in the Florida Keys and has been questioned
about the bombing, the FBI spokesman said. He refused to say what,
if anything, the suspect told agents.
   Ciganek was arraigned in Fort Myers federal court Monday on the
drug indictment.
   ``I just want a fair trial,'' Ciganek said after declaring
himself indigent and in need of a court-appointed attorney. He was
ordered held without bond.
   Saturday's bombing destroyed the DEA office building in a quiet
Fort Myers neighborhood. Remnants of the pipe bomb, which
apparently used gasoline as a fire accelerant, have been sent to
FBI laboratories in Washington for analysis.
   Washington DEA spokesman Bill Ruzzamenti said that although
agency offices around the world have been informed about the
bombing, there have been no new security measures taken.
   ``The situation in Fort Myers is an isolated incident,'' he said.
   But in Yakima, Wash. _ a key station on the Northwest drug route
from Mexico _ head DEA agent Robert Dreisbach acknowledged security
has been heightened, although he would not disclose details.
   ``We have taken certain security precautions as a result of Fort
Myers and continuing threats to all DEA offices from
drug-trafficking organizations,'' Dreisbach said.
   Jim Braseth, agent in charge in Minneapolis, says his office has
not received any threats, nor has it inreased security because of
the Fort Myers bombing. In Indianapolis, David H. McDougal, the
resident agent in charge, said that although the bombing appears
local, ``this just shows that it is a war.''
   The bombing, along with threats from Colombian drug dealers and
the slayings of agents around the world, points to the agency's
limits in protecting itself, the DEA acknowledges.
   Ruzzamenti mentioned the kidnapping and murder of undercover
investigator Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena in Mexico and the slaying of
a DEA agent in the Bogota, Colombia, office.
   ``Over the last few years we have certainly become much more
security-conscious than we were,'' Ruzzamenti said. ``The drug
traffickers of today are much more violent and brutal than they
used to be _ we have seen what happens to agents overseas.''
   The bombing will likely make agents more careful, said Miami DEA
spokesman John Fernandes. He said he still checks carefully before
entering his car and follows different routes to and from his home,
even though he no longer works in the streets.
   But surrounding DEA offices with armed guards, for instance,
would make it difficult for the agency to function in a free
society.
   ``We can't shut ourselves off behind an iron wall,'' Fernandes
said. ``We work with the public.''

   State television attacked the British royal
family on Monday as Iraq increased the tone of its attacks on
London for its condemnation of the hanging of a London-based
journalist.
   The television upbraided members of Queen Elizabeth II's family
for alleged immorality, broadcasting segments of programs about the
monarchy.
   ``Elizabeth does not feel any shame despite the fact that her
family members are hanging out their dirty linen before the
people,'' a TV announcer said.
   A Buckingham Palace spokesman, asked in London whether he had
any comment on the Iraqi TV attack, replied Monday night, ``No, not
at all.''
   The television claimed that Prince Charles, heir to the throne,
married Diana even though he knew there were many men in her life
before him, including his brother Prince Andrew.
   The television announcer asked how Charles could marry such ``a
playgirl,'' without giving the source of his comments on Diana or
further details.
   Diana was a friend of the royal family before her marriage and
knew Andrew, Charles and others from childhood, but London
newspapers have not carried reports that such relationships were
anything like those portrayed by Iraqi TV.
   For women, premarital love affairs are taboo in much of the Arab
world and would bring deep shame upon their families.
   The television showed scenes of the royals in their leisure time
and said they were living at the expense of millions of poor people
in Britain.
   It said Andrew married Sarah Ferguson although he knew she had
had a love affair with ``a businessman.''
   Miss Ferguson, now known as the Duchess of York, dated several
men before her marriage, including a romance with a motor-racing
millionaire. There was no effort to conceal it.
   The state television broadcast other details on the life of the
monarchy that it said showed bad behavior on the part of the royal
family.
   Farzad Bazoft, 31, an Iranian-born reporter for the British
weekly The Observer, was hanged Thursday after being convicted of
spying for Britain and Israel. He was arrested while trying to
investigate reports that an explosion at an Iraqi military complex
killed hundreds of people.
   Bazoft and his newspaper denied he was a spy. Editor Donald
Trelford said alleged confessions produced by the Iraqi authorities
were clearly extracted under duress.
   The execution outraged Britain, which recalled its ambassador,
expelled six Iraqi military trainees, canceled a trade mission and
suspended visits by government ministers.
   London stopped short of breaking relations, however.
   Thousands of Iraqis demonstrated Saturday in Baghdad to protest
the British actions. The television report on the British monarchy
was clearly intended as part of a growing campaign against Britain
and its leaders.

   Nicolae Ceausescu's henchmen Monday
won a postponement of an appeal of their convictions for backing
the Romanian dictator's order to fire on protesters during the
December revolution.
   The defense attorneys argued that the convictions of complicity
to commit genocide were the first ever in Romania and that they
needed to do research outside the country to effectively defend
their clients on appeal.
   Tudor Postelnicu, Emil Bobu, Manea Manescu and Ion Dinca pleaded
guilty to the charges and were convicted last month. They are
appealing their sentences, which range up to life in prison.
   Bobu, 62, was secretary of the Communist Party Central Committee
and the third-ranking member of the Ceausescu hierarchy after the
dictator and his wife, Elena.
   Ceausescu was toppled after the demonstrations grew into a
violent revolution, and he and his wife were executed on Christmas
Day following a secret military trial.
   Postelnicu, 59, was Ceausescu's interior minister; Manescu, 74,
was vice president of the former State Council; and Dinca, 62, was
a Politburo member, as were his co-defendants.
   ``I ask for a new period of time for the court appeal since I
regard the charge of genocide against the four defendants as a
premiere for us and for international judiciary practice,'' Virgil
Rata, Postelnicu's attorney, told the military tribunal hearing the
appeal.
   He noted that in 1973 Romania ratified the 1948 international
convention on genocide, but said he knew very little about how it
has been applied over the years.
   ``I personally am handicapped and I more or less improvised from
the few pages of international law that I had at my disposal,''
Rata said.
   He also said ``political murder cannot be included within the
charge of genocide.''
   ``Crimes, murders and massacres existed before,'' Rata said,
citing the mass killing of alleged Communists after the overthrow
of Indonesian President Sukarno in 1965. ``No state, be it Western
or Eastern, ever raised the issue of genocide then.''
   The defense attorneys for the others agreed with the arguments,
and court President Col. Cornel Badoiu postponed the appeal until
April 23.
   The prosecution agreed with the delay on the grounds that the
defense should have all necessary information to conduct the appeal.
   During the one-hour session at a former police training academy,
the four defendants sat in a prisoner's dock, clad in the
gray-striped wool tunics and trousers customarily worn by Romanian
prison inmates.
   The four, whose hair had been closely cropped in prison,
conferred with each other during the session and chatted with their
guards during a break in the proceedings.
   Manescu wiped his eyes frequently, but the other three showed
little emotion. Manescu's wife sat several rows from the prisoners'
dock.
   ``I swear with my hand on the cross that he is not guilty,'' she
said in an interview.
   ``He didn't give any orders (to shoot demonstrators). He only
followed (them) and put into practice the measures that had been
dictated to him,'' said Mrs. Manescu, who refused to give her first
name.
   Central to the guilty verdict was a Dec. 17 Politburo meeting at
which Ceausescu announced his intent to use deadly force against
protesters to quell demonstrations that began in the Western city
of Timisoara.
   Ceausescu offered to resign after several Politburo members
protested his demand for the resignations of Postelnicu, Defense
Minister Vasile Milea and Chief of Security Iulian Vlad for not
carrying out his orders to shoot protesters in Timisoara.
   Ultimately, the Politburo members asked Ceausescu to remain on.
   The prosecution argued during the trial that the defendants
could have prevented the slaughter of demonstrators by accepting
Ceausescu's resignation.

<HEAD>Illinois Candidates Head for Finish Line after Lackluster Race</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DOWLING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Candidates in an ideologically charged
gubernatorial race and a pair of bitter congressional contests
trudged toward the finish line Monday, but most voters were
apparently ignoring them.
   Sunny skies and temperatures in the low 50s were forecast for
Tuesday's primary, but state election officials predicted that
little more than one-fourth of Illinois' 6 million registered
voters would cast ballots.
   However, a 44 percent turnout was projected among Chicago's 1.4
million voters, partly because of a hotly contested, highly
publicized four-way contest for county board president in Cook
County, which includes Chicago.
   The gubernatorial race, the most-watched contest statewide,
matched two-term Secretary of State Jim Edgar, the candidate backed
by the state GOP hierarchy, against conservative political
organizer Steven Baer.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday that
President Bush and GOP National Chairman Lee Atwater both supported
Edgar.
   Baer has attacked Edgar's support of abortion rights and
extension of a temporary state income tax increase. He has dubbed
Edgar ``Pinocchio'' for what he said were contradictory statements
on taxes.
   Edgar aides have accused Baer of lying about Edgar's positions
on abortion. Edgar says he supports the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973
Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion.
   Edgar told a rally Monday in the state Capitol rotunda that a
large turnout ``will be good for democracy ... and very good for
Jim Edgar.'' Baer held out hope for an upset fueled by a
get-out-the-vote effort targeting anti-abortion households and
conservatives.
   ``I think we've done everything that's humanly possible, and I
think there are going to be a lot of surprised faces tomorrow,'' he
said at a campaign stop in Springfield.
   In one of the congressional races, Democratic Rep. Sidney Yates
of Chicago faced a well-financed challenge from Chicago alderman
Edwin Eisendrath, who claimed that a weekend canvass showed him
leading the 20-term congressman.
   Yates, 80, complained that the 31-year-old Eisendrath had
unfairly maligned him with a campaign pamphlet comparing Yates to
an antique typewriter and an obsolete television set.
   Eisendrath rebuffed the accusation Monday at a meeting with
campaign workers, saying, ``There's nothing wrong with pointing out
that a man is out of touch.''
   On the city's South Side, flamboyant and controversial five-term
Democratic U.S. Rep. Gus Savage was locked in a rematch with
educator Melvin Reynolds, who characterized Savage as ``totally
ineffective.''
   In the Cook County board race, there was last-minute
barnstorming by front-runners Richard Phelan, who was special
counsel in the House Ethics Committee's investigation of former
House Speaker Jim Wright, and former state appellate Judge Eugene
Pincham.
   Voters at a lunchtime Phelan appearance in downtown Chicago said
the Cook County contests had overshadowed the other primaries for
offices such as governor.
   ``Is that tomorrow? I didn't even know about it,'' said Richard
Gutierrez, 25, of Cicero. ``It's all been about Cook County, that's
where most of the media's been focused, not the governor's race.''
   ``You just see them on TV and the names run together,'' added
Jamie Mortellaro, 25, of Chicago.
   The statewide ballot was almost completely clear of contested
races, the result of furious maneuvering last year by party leaders
to ensure their top candidates a clear shot at the fall election.
   Two-term Democratic Attorney General Neil Hartigan was
guaranteed a fall match with the winner of the GOP gubernatorial
primary, while U.S. Sen. Paul Simon and his Republican challenger,
U.S. Rep. Lynn Martin, were unopposed in their respective primaries.
   But party leaders' favorites were struggling in the handful of
contested races.
   The Democrats' slated candidate for Cook County Board president,
state Sen. Ted Lechowicz, was running last in the four-way race,
according to independent polls. Cook County Clerk Stanley Kusper
was also in the race.
   Slated candidates for state treasurer and comptroller were also
locked in close races.

   Weather forecasters broke more bad news
Monday to parched Greece: There is no rain in sight for the nation,
which is suffering from its worst drought in a century.
   The weather bureau said no rain had fallen in the agricultural
north for 75 days, and bureau spokesman Andreas Lazanis said none
was forecast for at least the next six days.
   The drought has endangered winter crops and spring planting,
according to agricultural officials.
   Residents of Yiannitsa, a farming community near Salonica in
northern Greece, prayed for rain at Sunday religious services.
   Rainfall also was very low last winter, and the government last
week announced an emergency plan to drill for extra water because
Athens' reservoirs reportedly contain only enough to last until
November.
   No rainfall figures for the latest weeks were available. But
figures released by the weather bureau indicated that January
rainfall in the Athens area was less than a fifth of that month's
average of 2 inches.
   In an interview with the newspaper Ta Nea on Monday, Environment
Minister Costas Liaskas said $31 million had been allocated to
drill for underground reserves near Athens.
   He said the main reason for the water shortage was the drought.
``But we must add that the water has not been managed correctly,''
Liaskas said.
   He said a lot of water had been lost because of leaking
aquaducts.

   Thousands of students held an all-day
rally Monday demanding that direct president elections replace the
electoral college dominated by elderly Nationalist politicians
elected in China before 1949.
   The protest came two days before the 752-seat electoral college,
known as the National Assembly, meets to select the next president.
The only candidate is President Lee Teng-hui of the ruling
Nationalist Party.
   About 3,000 students boycotted classes at about a dozen
universities throughout Taiwan to take part in the first major
student demonstration here since this island nation lifted martial
law in 1987 after 38 years.
   In heavy rain, they linked arms and sang ``United we have
strength, as students we have strength'' in Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Park, named after the Nationalist leader who moved his
government to Taiwan after losing a civil war to Communist forces
on the Chinese mainland in 1949.
   Students pledged to continue the protest until after the
presidential election. About half those at the rally announced
plans to stay in the park overnight.
   Sixteen classmates began a hunger strike they said would last
until the government responded to their demands.
   The deputies in the National Assembly, many in their 80s and
90s, were allowed to remain indefinitely in office to support the
Nationalist claim to still be the sole legitimate government of all
of China.
   The students also asked the government to issue a timetable for
democratic change.
   They rejected a call by Lee to end their occupation of the park,
which began with a sit-in by 200 students last Friday.
   Students shunned political demonstrations under martial law and
rarely participated in protests organized by the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party the past three years.
   ``As the political situation deteriorated, students are coming
out of their fears about participation in political movements,''
said Chang Chung-tung, history professor at National Taiwan
University.
   University students in Beijing occupied Tiananmen Square for
weeks last spring to press demands for a freer society in Communist
China, and some demonstrators here acknowledged they were trying to
recreate that spirit.
   Almost all of Taiwan's 20 million people are ethnic Chinese and
the Beijing student movement _ crushed by troops _ received wide
sympathy here.

   Visiting former President Jimmy
Carter on Monday accused Israel of violating Palestinian rights in
the occupied lands and argued against settling Soviet Jews in
Jerusalem, government officials said.
   His remarks came on a day when a 20-year-old Palestinian was
shot and killed in a stone-throwing clash with Israeli troops in
the occupied Gaza Strip, according to Arab reports. An 18-year-old
died of a head wound suffered a day earlier.
   Carter met privately with officials during a visit to an
absorption center for Israeli immigrants Monday in Mevasseret Zion,
five miles west of Jerusalem.
   ``The settlement of Soviet immigrants in Jerusalem serves only
to spark Palestinian protests and should be discouraged,'' an
official, speaking anonymously, quoted Carter as saying during the
meeting.
   On Sunday, Carter told Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek that
Jerusalem should remain a united city. President Bush has equated
Jewish neighborhoods in east Jerusalem with West Bank settlements.
   On a visit to Amman, Jordan, Carter called settlement of Soviet
Jewish immigrants in the West Bank and Gaza Strip ``an impediment
to peace.''
   Israel captured the territories, along with Arab east Jerusalem,
from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East War. It annexed east
Jerusalem as part of its capital, and the Jewish neighborhoods
built around the city are not considered occupied territory by most
of the Israeli public.
   Israel denies it directs immigrants to the occupied lands,
saying they are free to choose where they want to live. About 200
Soviet immigrants have so far settled in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Israeli leaders have said they expect thousands of Soviet
immigrants in the next decade because of liberalized Soviet exit
policies and U.S. visa restrictions.
   Children greeted the former U.S. president with flowers and
kisses on his arrival at the absorption center, a temporary home
where about 800 immigrants spend their first months here studying
the Hebrew language.
   However, children from observant, right-wing families in the
surrounding areas protested the visit, waving Israeli flags and
holding a banner saying ``Jerusalem Not For Sale.''
   The right-wing Tehiya party sent Carter a telegram saying he was
``not a wanted guest in our country,'' the national news agency
Itim said.
   ``Your policy is not neutral. It represents PLO and Palestinian
positions,'' the telegram reportedly said. The government and many
Israelis consider the Palestine Liberation Organization a terrorist
group.
   After a meeting earlier Monday with directors of the left-wing
Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied
Territories, Carter said he was distressed by reports that
Palestinians were jailed without trial and that houses were
demolished to punish Arab families.
   He also accused Israel of ``excessive use of firearms by the
military that are not under life-threatening situations.''
   ``What we are talking about is an authoritative government that
is in charge that is depriving the people under its control of
their basic human rights,'' Carter told reporters.
   ``I think the intefadeh (uprising) is being perpetuated
partially by the abuse of the Palestinians.''
   The latest fatality occurred in the Sheik Radwan neighborhood of
Gaza City, when soldiers fired live ammunition to quell
stone-throwing, Arab reports said.
   Arab hospital officials identified the victim as Osama
El-Sharwish of Gaza City.
   Also Monday, Nafi Rafik Zakout of Jabaliya refugee camp died in
Israel's Tel Hashomer Hospital. He was hit in the head with a
plastic bullet fired by troops during a clash in Gaza City a day
earlier.
   The army confirmed Zakout's death and said it was checking the
report on El-Sharwish.
   The deaths raised to 666 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli soldiers or civilians in the 27-month-old Palestinian
uprising against Israeli rule in the territories.
   An additional 198 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs,
most on suspicion of collaborating with Israeli authorities.
Forty-three Israelis have died in the violence.

   A secret government security
unit planned bombings and killings, and it once employed a witch
doctor to put a spell on Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a former agent
testified Monday.
   Abraham ``Snake'' Van Zyl told an inquiry hearing that agents of
the secret Civilian Cooperation Bureau had conducted a major
underground campaign against anti-apartheid activists. He said the
main targets were the African National Congress, Nelson Mandela's
group, and the South African Communist Party.
   ``Disruption of the enemy ranged from breaking windows to
killing,'' he told the official inquiry.
   Van Zyl, a former police officer, said he and other agents tried
to use ``muti,'' or magic, against Tutu, an anti-apartheid activist
who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize. He said they hanged a monkey
fetus prepared by a witch doctor in Tutu's driveway and drove
magically treated nails into the driveway.
   He did not say exactly how this was supposed to affect Tutu.
   The government has ordered an investigation into the Cooperation
Bureau, which was reportedly run by the South African Defense
Forces to wage a secret war against groups fighting the white
government's apartheid policies of racial discrimination. South
African newspapers have reported that top generals were linked to
the unit's activities.
   Opposition leaders contend the security forces are tied to the
deaths or disappearance of dozens of anti-government activists in
recent years. Several former police officers have admitted
involvement in killings of government opponents and other illegal
activities.
   Van Zyl, who said he was speaking because he wanted the truth to
come out, also said the unit bombed a school in Cape Town in 1989
because it was reportedly used as a meeting place by anti-apartheid
activists.
   He said it also planned to kill anti-apartheid leader Dullah
Omar by inducing a heart attack by swapping medicine for poison.
   Van Zyl also said the unit planned to kill Gavin Evans, a
journalist.
   Most of the schemes described by Van Zyl appeared to end in
failure.
   Van Zyl recounted how he was recruited into the unit by military
intelligence officers and given a salary and allowances that
allowed him to buy a BMW car. He said he and other agents set up
businesses with government funds to mask their activities and serve
as front organizations.

   The United Nations will start
transporting about 104,000 tons of relief supplies to war-torn
southern Sudan by early April, a U.N. spokeswoman said Monday.
   Pat Banks said in a statement the supplies will be ferried in
from the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, and from neighboring Kenya and
Uganda by helicopters, trains and barges.
   She said the effort is a resumption of Operation Lifeline, a
relief project to aid people affected by southern Sudan's
7-year-old civil war. About 500,000 people are at risk of death as
a result of war and starvation.
   A meeting of donors is scheduled for next Monday in Khartoum to
plan the project in detail.
   Operation Lifeline succeeded in part last year until a
cease-fire between Sudan's government and the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army was broken in the fall.

   Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa of
Syria met with President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran on Monday and
Rafsanjani stressed Iran's support for Syria in its confrontation
with Israel, Tehran radio said.
   Sharaa emphasized the close relations between Syria and Iran.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Sharaa
discussed Palestine, Lebanon and other subjects with Iranian
officials during his visit to Iran. But it did not mention the
issue of Western hostages in Lebanon.
   Both IRNA and Tehran radio were monitored in Nicosia.
   IRNA said Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati emphasized the
need for even stronger ties between Persian Iran and Arab Syria in
two hours of talks Sunday.
   The radio quoted Sharaa as saying Sunday that Syria doubted
Israel would seek peace.
   ``Syria is very well aware of the fact that Israel does not want
peace and security in the region and that it is thinking of
increasing its sphere of influence _ in other words, of
consolidating the occupation of Jerusalem and other Arab
territories,'' Sharaa was quoted as saying.
   Syria is Iran's main Arab ally and supported it against Iraq in
the 1980-88 Persian Gulf war.
   The Syrians, with 40,000 troops in Lebanon, have been
instrumental in helping release Western hostages in the past.
   Last month, Sharaa told Peggy Say, sister of American hostage
Terry Anderson, that he would raise the issue of Iranian help to
free the 18 Westerners held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian groups.
   Rafsanjani has said he believes the hostage issue is moving
toward solution. The radical faction that opposes him has argued
against the hostages' release, however.

<TEXT>
   Joseph Hazelwood's defense lost a legal
battle Monday over a single word that could affect how jurors
decide whether the Exxon Valdez skipper was drunk when his ship
went aground.
   The word was ``noticeably,'' and was contained in a legal
instruction that told jurors to decide whether Hazelwood was
``noticeably impaired'' on the night of the nation's largest oil
spill.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone removed the word and said he
would tell jurors they must only decide whether Hazelwood was
impaired.
   ``There are a lot of people who can mask their impairment,'' he
told lawyers in explaining his decision.
   Defense lawyer Dick Madson appeared stunned by the ruling,
saying, ``This is the first time I've ever heard of this.''
   Madson said in his years of defending drunken driving cases in
Fairbanks, the term ``noticeably impaired'' always has been
included in jury instructions.
   ``My gosh, it's been around for a long time,'' he told the judge.
   But Assistant District Attorney Sam Adams argued, ``All we have
to prove is that he was impaired, not stumble-down drunk.''
   Hazelwood is charged with one felony, criminal mischief, and
three misdemeanors, reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while
intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil.
   His tanker ran aground on Bligh Reef last March 24, spilling
nearly 11 million gallons of Alaska North Slope crude oil, wreaking
devastation over hundreds of miles of shoreline rich with fish,
birds and other wildlife.
   The question of whether Hazelwood showed signs of intoxication
has been a key element in his trial, with numerous witnesses
testifying that the skipper did not stagger, slur his words or show
any other evidence that he was drunk. Three witnesses said they
smelled alcohol on his breath.
   The judge's ruling came during a discussion of legal
instructions which will be given to jurors after attorneys deliver
their final arguments Tuesday.
   In other rulings, the judge said he would ``take judicial
notice'' of the fact the U.S. Coast Guard had a regulation barring
tanker crews from drinking alcohol less than four hours before
sailing. But he refused to give an instruction on the point,
because the regulation is not state law.
   He also refused a proposed prosecution instruction that would
have told jurors the Coast Guard's blood alcohol limit for
operating a commercial vessel is .04, well below the state level of
.10 for drunken driving. Hazelwood's blood alcohol level was below
the state limit, but violated the Coast Guard's.
   The judge noted the Coast Guard standard is a federal
regulation, not a state law, and has not been admitted into
evidence at the trial.
   He rejected a last-minute request by the defense to tell jurors
that reckless driving and negligent driving are lesser included
offenses of criminal mischief.
   The instruction would have given jurors the option of convicting
Hazelwood on the reduced charges rather than the single felony.

   Assailants strolled into an ice cream
parlor in a northwestern town and sprayed it with gunfire, killing
six people and wounding four, police said Monday.
   Authorities were trying to determine the identities of the
gunmen and the motive for the shooting late Sunday in Apartado, 280
miles north of Bogota, a police statement said.
   It said most victims were workers on the banana plantations that
cover the Uraba region on the border with Panama.
   The town has been wracked by violence recently. Mayor Diana
Cardona was kidnapped and killed by a group of unidentified men on
Feb. 26.
   Cardona was a member of the leftist Patriotic Union Party, whose
leaders blamed her death on the region's right-wing death squads.
   Authorities have blamed the death squads for several massacres
targeting union organizers and leftist leaders in Uraba in recent
years.
   Also Monday, five leftist guerrillas belonging to the National
Liberation Army were killed in a battle with the army on the
country's northeastern border with Venezuela, an army statement
said.

   The Soviet Union's reported consideration of
Polish-style radical economic reforms indicates an admission that
perestroika so far has been insufficient, says one of the
architects of Poland's plan.
   But the Soviet Union must not follow the Polish strategy too
closely, because there are substantial differences between the
countries' economies, said Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard University
economist and one of Poland's main economic advisers since the
country abandoned Communist rule last year.
   The Soviet news agency Interfax reported Monday that Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is preparing to implement drastic
changes effective July 1, including reforming the state-set pricing
system, selling off state-owned industries and developing a plan to
make the ruble convertible.
   The news agency said the strategy was developed by 60 Soviet
economists, who modeled it after the Polish plan.
   Sachs, in a telephone interview, said that despite Soviet
attempts at reforms during Gorbachev's five years in power, the
country in some ways has more dire problems than Poland.
   For one, Soviets have ``terrible overhangs'' of money _
disproportionately high savings due to a lack of goods for
consumers to purchase, he said. That means making the ruble
convertible to foreign currencies could prompt high inflation.
   Poland, by comparison, had suffered years of rampant inflation
that ate up savings and has started to subside under the reforms,
Sachs said.
   He said the Soviet Union could lower the money supply by setting
a limit on savings acount withdrawals, by doubling both wages and
prices or even by confiscation.
   In addition, Poland is much further along in decentralizing
control of industry, Sachs said, whereas the Soviet Union remains
mired in inefficient central planning.
   And, he noted, Poland in previous years had been more concerned
than the Soviet Union about developing trade with other countries.
   Sachs also pointed out that Poland's reforms are bolstered by
substantial economic aid from other countries. The Soviet Union
must be willing to accept similar aid, he said.
   The Soviet Union thus far has appeared to be offended by
suggestions that it accept aid on the order of the Marshall Plan,
the blueprint for European economic recovery after World War II.
But Interfax quoted Gorbachev aide Nikolai Petrakov as saying such
aid had not been ruled out.
   Sachs roughly estimated that the Soviet Union would need about
$90 billion in foreign aid.
   Although Western countries might balk at coming up with that
much in aid, it would be ``the deal of the century'' for opening up
trade with the West and reducing Western defense expenditures
through the reduction of military tension, Sachs said.
   Despite the differences between the Polish and Soviet economies,
Sachs said the Soviet Union can expect to have one experience in
common with Poland if it undertakes reforms that go beyond
perestroika's so-far mild moves _ substantial unemployment.
   After decades of nearly full employment, about 150,000 Poles
have become unemployed since the reforms were implemented.
   ``It is an inevitable offshoot,'' said Sachs, who added that he
believed the unemployment would be short-term suffering for
long-term gain. ``I would tell them to keep their perspective.''

   An explosion on a container ship loading
aluminum at a wharf in this Quebec town Monday killed two people
and injured at least seven, police and company sources said.
   Sgt. Maurice Girard of La Baie police said the afternoon blast
rocked the town along the Saguenay River about 120 miles north of
Quebec City. Some residents thought there had been an earthquake.
   Alcan Aluminium runs the wharf, which is used to service its
local smelter.
   Alcan employee Fernard Leclerc said the two killed were members
of the crew of the Pollux, a Norwegian ship.
   He said they were loading containers into the ship's hold, where
the explosion occurred. Leclerc said seven Alcan employees were
injured.
   He said he could only speculate about the cause of the
explosion. He said the material in the containers _ spent linings
from the smelting process of aluminum _ ``can, under certain
conditions and if not properly handled, produce toxic gases,
including methane.''
   Girard said the ship wasn't seriously damaged.

   Masked youths firebombed and destroyed a
branch office of Greece's conservative New Democracy party on
Monday, the latest in a rash of urban attacks before April 8
national elections.
   About 10 minutes later, a gang burned the nearby office of New
Democracy parliamentary candidate Nontas Zafeiropoulos.
   Police speculated it was the same band. They reported no arrests.
   Witnesses said about 15 masked youths smashed the windows of the
party's Exarheia branch and then hurled firebombs into the
ground-floor offices.
   About 10 party workers escaped unharmed but the offices were
destroyed, they said, speaking on condition of not being identified.
   The government pledged a crackdown Friday on anarchists
firebombing police and party offices and planting bombs under
police vehicles.
   A police officer was badly hurt early Sunday when youths
firebombed his patrol car.
   The self-proclaimed anarchists are protesting the shooting
deaths of two 15-year-old boys by police.
   A policeman was acquitted in January of the death of a youth
involved in a firebomb attack on a police bus in 1985. Another
officer is under investigation for killing a masked youth who broke
into an arms store in Preveza this month.

<TEXT>
   A frustrated federal judge ordered Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh to court to explain the government's
abandonment of a settlement involving a drug-laden plane leased to
U.S. agents and linked to the Contras.
   U.S. District Judge Patrick Kelly said the case involved
criminal conduct by the United States.
   ``This case stinks to high heaven,'' Kelly said during a hearing
on a lawsuit over the loss of the twin-engine Beech King Air, which
was ditched in the Caribbean Sea on Jan. 3, 1983.
   The pilot, convicted smuggler Michael Toliver, later testified
that he flew arms to Nicaragua's Contra rebels and illegal drugs
back to the United States several times under the supervision of
federal agents.
   Kelly had canceled a trial set for January after being told in
November that the case had been settled through mediation.
   But on Friday, Richard Montague, an assistant U.S. attorney
general from Washington, told Kelly that Justice Department
officials never approved the settlement, and said the case should
go to trial.
   Kelley ordered Thornburgh to appear at an April 2 hearing in
Wichita to straighten out the lawsuit's status.
   Thornburgh aide Michael Robinson said Monday that the attorney
general had not yet decided how to respond to the order.
   Kelly told Montague that the case ``involves the transport of
drugs by agents of the United States or with the acquiescence of
the United States.'' Montague objected, saying that Toliver was the
only witness making such statements and that his credibility was
questionable. The attorney said the insurance case had nothing to
do with those statements.
   Kelly said he was frustrated by the government's lack of action
in response to Toliver's disclosures.
   ``I have heard nothing,'' the judge said. ``Frankly, what I have
had is stonewalling at the hands of the United States and I'm not
going to have any more.''
   Kelly had been so alarmed by Toliver's statements that he
ordered transcripts of the testimony delivered to the FBI, CIA and
to then-President Reagan at Bethesda Naval Hospital.
   ``The president of the United States advised me in spades that
the attorney general was fully familiar with it, and I don't think
you are,'' Kelly told Montague, who was representing the Justice
Department.
   Montague said the question of whether a criminal investigation
was warranted was up to the attorney general, not the judge.
   Toliver testified in Kelly's court in 1987 that he made two
trips to Honduras and Colombia the previous year with arms for the
Contras and returned to the United States with loads of cocaine and
marijuana.
   He said he landed at Homestead Air Force Base, Fla., with one
drug load and that he worked as an informant and contract employee
under federal supervision.
   Toliver testified that he wasn't working for the government when
he crashed the plane. He said he had disconnected a U.S. Customs
Service homing device aboad the plane, and took off in another
direction with a load of marijuana. He ditched the craft off Grand
Cayman Island when he ran out of fuel trying to avoid storms.
   Toliver, who is serving a marijuana smuggling sentence in North
Carolina, was granted immunity in exchange for his testimony.
   The lawsuit was filed by Midland National Bank of Newton, which
said it had a $198,000 lien on the plane.
   The defendants included the plane's owner, Walter Conlogue, who
said his company, American Aircraft Co. of Newton, leased the
aircraft to U.S. Customs agents to help in an undercover drug
investigation.
   Puritan Insurance Co. of Stamford, Conn. refused to pay a claim
on the plane's $225,000 insurance policy, saying Conlogue lied
about the plane's use.
   Conlogue said he was warned that if he did not do so, ``innocent
people would suffer and be killed.''
   The insurance company is both a defendant and a plaintiff in the
lawsuit. The government is also a defendant.
   Friday's hearing was held to determine why the government had
not paid the settlement negotiated in November. The terms of the
agreement have not been revealed.

   The Bush administration avoided criticizing
Moscow over Lithuania on Monday but said it would keep an eye on
Soviet military activities in the Baltic region.
   White House and State Department spokesmen called for a peaceful
approach to secession and reminded Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev he had said force would not be used.
   ``There are discussions that need to be held with the USSR,''
said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary. ``We want
that to be a peaceful process.''
   Fitzwater and State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
declined to say whether the Soviets had engaged in coercion. ``I
don't want to speculate, one way or another,'' Boucher said.
   The spoke as a delegation of Lithuanian legislators went to
Moscow seeking talks on their declaration of independence.
   Gorbachev has condemned the move as illegal and demanded a
renunciation. In Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, President
Vytautus Landsbergis said Soviet military maneuvers were raising
tensions in the region. On Sunday, Soviet military jets buzzed
Vilnius and Soviet troops held maneuvers in the countryside.
   ``The military exercises of Soviet troops in Lithuania now under
way are intensifying tensions,'' Landsbergis told Lithuania's
legislature, according to Lithuanian television editor Eduardas
Potashinkis, who monitored the meeting.
   In Arlington, Va., Asta Banionist of the Lithuanian American
Community Inc., said she had received reports that 10 truckloads of
Soviet paratroopers entered the northeast quadrant of Vilnius
Monday afternoon.
   ``They are waiting for orders,'' she said.
   A spokesman for the Lithuanian nationalist movement Sajudis,
Lionginas Vasiliauskas, said in Moscow that 10 truckloads of Soviet
troops were moved Monday from Kaunas, about 60 miles from Vilnius,
to a military post just outside the capital.
   Also, Ms. Banionist said she had reports that KGB agents had
entered the atomic energy plant at Ignalina as well as television
and radio stations, but without interrupting or altering broadcasts.
   A broadcast of Radio Vinius heard in Washington Monday night was
heavily jammed.
   Her group says it has 100,000 members in 75 chapters across the
United States.
   Mark Dillen, a State Department spokesman, said he no
information about the matters Ms. Banionist discussed.
   Asked earlier about the maneuvers, Boucher at the State
Department replied with what he called ``more general comments.''
   They were, he said, ``that we've always stressed the importance
to resolving the differences there peacefully. We have called for
negotiations and discussions that take place without coercion or
intimidation. Those discussions, in fact, are beginning today in
Moscow. We are watching developments closely.''
   Boucher then volunteered that both Gorbachev and Yegor Ligachev,
secretary of the Communist Party's Central Committee, have said
recently that force would not be used in the Baltic states.
   Asked whether he believed the Soviet was using coercion against
Lithuania, Boucher said, ``Again, I don't want to speculate one way
or the other or categorize what's been going on, other than to say
that we're following it.''
   Fitzwater repeated, meanwhile, that ``we want to see a peaceful
resolution of the situation there.''
   He said the United States continues to urge the Soviet
government ``to respect the will of the citizens of Lithuania.''
   And Fitzwater reiterated that the U.S. believes Lithuania was
incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940 forcibly.
   The Bush administration has not established diplomatic relations
with the breakaway republic. Fitzwater implied the step would be
taken provided Lithuania clearly was in charge of its own affairs.
``We have a standard of control of one's territory which guides us
in this matter,'' the White House spokesman said.

<HEAD>Romanian Protesters Attack Hungarian Political Headquarters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ABNER KATZMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romanians attacked an ethnic Hungarian
political association headquarters on Monday and the government
appealed to the military to help control the situation, a member of
Parliament reported.
   He quoted interim President Ion Iliescu as saying ethnic
Romanians from villages near Tirgu Mures went to that the
ethnically mixed, northwestern city and attacked headquarters of
the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania with axes.
   Mircea Dinescu, president of the Romanian Writers' Union, said
Iliescu confirmed reports of the raid to him and that Iliescu asked
the army for help.
   Dinescu belongs to the provisional parliament that is governing
Romania until May 20 elections. He was in Budapest, the Hungarian
capital, for a meeting of Hungarian and Romanian officials and
intellectuals and spoke in a telephone interview.
   Tirgu Mures, 180 miles northwest of Bucharest, was reported calm
late Monday. The city has a large ethnic Hungarian population and
is considered a cradle of Hungarian culture and tradition in
Transylvania.
   The ethnic Romanian demonstrators earlier Monday gathered before
local headquarters of the National Salvation Front and demanded the
resignation of its vice president, ethnic Hungarian Eloed Kincses,
claiming he promoted separatism among the population.
   Kincses agreed to resign, army Maj. Vasily Tria told The
Associated Press by telephone from Tirgu Mures.
   The Front took power in Romania in the December revolution that
overthrew Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, later executed. It
still dominates political life, but shares power with many other
representatives in a Council of National Unity that acts as a
makeshift parliament until elections.
   Under Ceausescu, Romanian-Hungarian ties were strained as
Budapest charged Romania with mistreating its 1.7 million ethnic
Hungarians _ Romania's largest ethnic minority _ and undermining
their culture and traditions.
   Ceausescu's controlled media accused Hungary of wanting to
change borders set by a 1920 treaty that granted Romania the
territory of Transylvania.
   Most ethnic Hungarians live there. The area was long ruled by
Hungary.
   After the headquarters attack, Hungarians gathered in protest
Monday night in front of the local radio station, Sandor Gaspar,
director of Tirgu Mures Radio, told The AP in a telephone interview.
   He said no injuries were reported.
   The attack followed a day of demonstrations by ethnic Romanians
carrying the national flag through the city and demanding their
rights.
   The area's ethnic Romanians have been complaining that
Hungarians desecrated Romanian symbols.
   The conflict has its roots in ethnic Hungarian demands for
political and cultural autonomy in Romania following the upheavals
of the revolution.
   Ceausescu suppressed the ethnic Hungarians and closed
Hungarian-language institutions.
   The Hungarian community claims discrimination continues.

   Greyhound said Monday it will not resume stalled
talks with striking drivers until attacks on buses and replacement
drivers stop, but a union leader pledged to meet ``any time'' with
company negotiators.
   The first meeting between the two sides broke down Sunday when
Dallas-based Greyhound accused union leaders of failing to
negotiate and of stepping up violence walkout, now in its third
week.
   ``A lot of the problem was the continuing intimidation and
violence,'' said company spokeswoman Lyn Grayley. ``The company
just does not feel that they will be intimidated into (accepting) a
contract.''
   ``Maybe if the violence and terrorism and intimidation and all
that stopped ... (reopening talks) would be considered,'' she said.
``Our main concern at this point is the safety of our passengers
and employees.''
   There have been at least 14 shooting attacks on Greyhound buses,
46 bomb threats and numerous other incidents of vandalism or
threats during the 18-day-old walkout, company officials say.
   Greyhound operates the only nationwide intercity bus service,
and the strike has stranded many smaller communities for which
buses are the only public transportation.
   Unions representing 6,300 drivers and an estimated 3,000 other
Greyhound workers walked out March 2 over wages, job security and
grievance procedures.
   In Denver, the Amalgamated Transit Union's vice president, Jim
Hayes, said the union would return to talks ``any time, any
place,'' but the sticking point is Greyhound's unwillingness to
compromise.
   ``The company hasn't changed a thing,'' he said. ``The company
makes one cent per mile for every passenger and that comes out to
about $78 million. We're asking for $40 million over 3 years.''
   The bus company last week began a nationwide radio advertising
campaign to counter allegations by striking drivers that newly
hired drivers were not properly trained.
   ``We've hired many new permanent drivers who are professionally
qualified, thoroughly trained and committed to giving you the
quality service you've come to expect from Greyhound,'' the radio
spots say.
   Ms. Grayley, the company spokeswoman, said the new drivers must
have two years experience driving a bus or truck, and are certified
by the Department of Transportation.
   ``With so many of the violent episodes that have gone on, people
are nervous,'' she said. ``And we don't want them to feel that's
going to happen every time a bus goes out on the road. We want them
to know we're doing everything in our power to make those buses
safe,'' she said.
   Union leaders say they condemned the violence and Greyhound is
the one balking in negotiations.
   ``We have continually called for our members to refrain from
illegal activity,'' said Jeff Nelson, spokesman for the Amalgamated
Council of Greyhound Local Unions in Washington. ``But, we are not
police.''
   ``This is simply an attempt by the company's so-called
negotiator to stonewall the real issue, which is negotiating a
contract,'' Nelson said.
   During talks in Tucson, Ariz. on Saturday, the union proposed a
$40 million three-year package that included pay increases of 4
percent to 5 percent and the addition of new drivers to the pension
plan.
   But the cost would be ``three times more than Greyhound could
afford,'' Ms. Grayley said.
   A union spokesman said the company has offered a plan that
included no guaranteed pay raises, but would have made raises
contingent on increased profits and ridership.
   Negotiations broke off Sunday after about an hour, but both
sides later met separately with federal mediators.
   ``I think we made some progress in the meetings,'' said Jim
Power, spokesman for the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service
in Washington.

<HEAD>Attorney General Would Curb US Aid to Drug Countries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said on
Monday he favors making U.S. aid to other countries conditional on
their cooperation in curbing drug traffic after they get a chance
to adopt needed laws.
   He pointed to an international pact on cooperation, signed by 89
governments. It will take effect when 20 of them have ratified it,
as the United States has already done.
   ``There will come a time when those that have not ratified the
convention will be questioned by those who have and who continue to
be concerned about the drug problem,'' he told reporters. ``I would
not rule out some action in this country at that time to indeed put
that kind of restriction on U.S. aid.''
   That would not happen in the foreseeable future, he added.
   He said that if he had his way, he would urge such a course
after an interval during which countries had the opportunity to
change their laws. He added that the process would take some time
and that the 89 governments presumably support the goal of
eradicating the drug traffic and money laundering.
   ``But that time is running and more and more nations are
ratifying the convention,'' he said.
   ``And particularly when we've reached the point where 20 nations
have ratified and the convention comes into force, then we'll be
looking to every nation around the world to do its share in dealing
with this problem.''
   Thornburgh emphasized the need for international cooperation. He
said there have been calls in Congress and the media for U.S.
intervention but that President Bush had chosen a more restrained
and measured response. Intervention would ultimately be
counter-productive, he said.
   He said the indictment in this country of Khun Sa, the opium war
lord in Burma, would step up the pressure on the international
community and improve the chances of getting hold of him. The
indictment was returned in December by a court in New York and
disclosed in Washington last week.
   Thornburgh said then that someone in Khun Sa's own forces might
betray him. Today he said that he knows there are substantial
obstacles to an arrest. Khun Sa has an army estimated at 4,000 to
16,000 men.
   Thornburgh predicted that drug money will seek outlets in other
banking systems as Switzerland and other countries tighten their
cooperation on money laundering.
   ``I expect no nation with a credible banking system to be
immune,'' he said.

   A court Monday convicted two men of the
1988 robbery and murder of a university sociologist who served as a
Solidarity union adviser, the official news agency reported.
   Jan Strzelecki, 69, died nearly three weeks after he was found
unconscious near the Vistula River in Warsaw, according to police
reports, which said he had been dragged from his car, assaulted and
thrown down an embankment.
   The Warsaw Provincial Court convicted and sentenced 20-year-old
Marek Tomasz Marzec to the maximum of 25 years in prison for the
June 1988 murder, the official PAP news agency said.
   The court also sentenced 26-year-old Krzysztof Chrobocinski to
14 years in prison. He had been charged with robbery and assault.
   The trial resumed Jan. 26 after being suspended so experts could
carry out tests that determined a stick Marzec used to beat
Strzelecki was capable of delivering a fatal blow.
   In its report, PAP did not suggest a motive for the crime.
   Strzelecki was not a prominent member of Solidarity, the
once-banned labor movement that took control of the Polish
government last year. However, he was an active supporter of
Solidarity at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the
Polish Academy of Sciences, where he was an associate professor.

   A pair of jaguar cubs given by
President Gen. Andres Rodriguez to Vice President Dan Quayle won't
be allowed to leave Paraguay after all, a government spokesman said.
   ``The cubs won't be allowed to travel to the United States
because the legal requirements are very strict,'' an aide to
Rodriguez said Sunday on condition of anonymity.
   Conservation groups consider the jaguar to be an endangered
species in Latin America, and on Thursday Rodriguez was told Quayle
would prefer that the cubs be released into the wilds of Paraguay.
   Rodriguez gave Quayle the jaguar cubs when the vice president
visited Paraguay March 12-13 on a tour of several Latin nations.
   Quayle originally accepted the cubs to conform with diplomatic
protocol, but had intended to try to give them to Washington's
National Zoo.
   But the zoo would not take the jaguars because of their status
as an endangered species, and an environmental group called the
vice president's office to protest their being taken from the wild.

   The government expelled two Amnesty
International workers investigating alleged human rights abuses
because they failed to make prior arrangements for their visit,
officials said Monday.
   However, an Interior Ministry spokesman said delegates from the
rights group could return to the North African country if they give
authorities advance notice.
   Amnesty International, based in London, said Friday its envoys
were told to leave Morocco after meeting last Tuesday with local
rights activists.
   Amnesty issued a statement saying its delegates were visiting
openly and had visited Morocco on a similar trip last month.
   The Interior Ministry spokesman, speaking on condition on
anonymity, said the Amnesty envoys were not expected until this
week and acknowledged they were asked to leave.
   ``We have no objections to Amnesty, and we will be happy to
explain every case to them in detail,'' the spokesman said. ``But
we insist that they show a minimum of respect for the host nation.''
   Amnesty reports that Moroccan police torture and illegally
detain suspects. The organization also has long-standing complaints
over the imprisonment of some of King Hassan II's political
opponents.
   Meanwhile Monday, the European Community's Fishing Commission
opened talks with Morocco's ministries of Fisheries and Foreign
Affairs.
   Morocco and Spain are at odds over fishing issues. The Spanish
say Moroccan courts have imposed excessive fines on Spanish
fishermen violating international rules.
   The Spanish have responded by blocking Moroccan ships from ports
in southern Spain. But they suspended that blockade when the
meeting with the Economic Community was announced.

   Shining Path guerrillas poured gasoline
on a pickup truck and set it ablaze Monday, killing four people
inside, including two congressional candidates, police said.
   Also, a column of about 100 of the Maoist-inspired insurgents
ambushed two army trucks carrying 50 soldiers on a main jungle
highway Monday, killing three soldiers, according to police.
   The report said one rebel was killed in the firefight, along
with two civilians in a truck passing near the scene. Another
civilian in a car was wounded.
   Police said the civilians were hit by stray bullets.
   The morning battle took place near Las Vegas, a town 10 miles
south of here.
   The report said police and army reinforcements were flown in by
helicopters from bases in Tingo Maria, 200 miles northeast of Lima.
   In a separate incident, Shining Path rebels stopped a pickup
truck carrying four people, doused it with gasoline and burned the
occupants alive.
   Among the occupants of the vehicle were Marino Meza, a
journalist, and Jose de la Torre, a doctor. Both were independent
candidates for Congress in the April 8 elections.
   The four were returning home from a campaign meeting in Acomaya,
a small town 30 miles southwest of here.
   The Mao-inspired group launched its armed insurgency 10 years
ago in the southern highlands near Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of
Lima. The group now operates throughout the highlands and parts of
the northeastern jungles.
   The government says more than 18,000 people have died in the
violence, including police, soldiers, rebels, government officials
and civilians.

   Broadcasts to North America by Radio Vilnius,
voice of the Lithuanian capital, were either jammed or silenced
Monday night, according to a frequent listener.
   The Radio Vilnius announcer suggested that the Soviet Ministry
of Communications was doing the jamming, and asked listeners in
Europe to tune to frequencies that are not relayed by Radio Moscow.
   Monday's broadcast, monitored in Washington, was barely audible
beneath ``a superimposed droning sound, a classic jamming
situation,'' said Paul Courson, amateur radio operator and anchor
for AP Network News
   The short-wave broadcasts to North America normally are made on
six different frequencies to ensure a good chance of reception in
all areas of the continent.
   The broadcasts are normally relayed by Radio Moscow on its
powerful transmitters.
   After the declaration of independence by the Lithuanian
parliament on March 5, the English-language broadcasts were heard
normally last week, said Courson.
   However, ``last night (Sunday night) they were missing
altogether,'' and Monday night, were missing from five of the six
scheduled frequencies, Courson said.
   The sixth frequency, 11.770 megahertz, carried the jammed
broadcast.
   A Lithuanian-American group, the Lithuanian-American Community
Inc., said in Arlington, Va., it had received reports that agents
of the KGB, the Soviet secret police, entered radio and television
stations in Lithuania but had not interfered with operations.
   Here is the transcript of Monday night's English broadcast,
recorded by the AP. Though the annoucner begins by blaming Radio
Moscow for the jamming, he later seems to blame the ministry.
   By custom in Lithuania and the Soviet Union, the announcer is
not identified.
   ``For many years now, Radio Vilnius external service in
Lithuanian and English languanges has been using the powerful
system of relay stations in exterior parts of the Soviet Union.
   ``Thanks to these relay stations, our broadcasts could be heard
in more than 50 countries of the world.
   ``Besides short-wave frequencies, Radio Vilnius programs in
Lithuanian and English are also broadcast on medium wave, through
relatively weak transmitters located in Lithuania. Their signal
strength, however, is sufficient to be heard in northern Europe,
West Germany, and Great Britain. As these transmitters are located
in Lithuania, we advise all Radio Vilnius listeners in Europe to
tune in to these medium-wave broadcasts.
   ``Today the leaders of the Lithuanian radio and TV networks and
Radio Vilnius people have been getting in touch with high-level or
ranking officials of Radio Moscow. It appears the blockade of Radio
Vilnius broadcasts was a surprise to them, and they promised to
clear up what the matter was.
   ``This suggests that perhaps the blockade of Radio Vilnius
broadcasts abroad was not conducted by Radio Moscow, but rather by
the Minister of Communications of the USSR. But so far, no answer
from that ministry has been received.''

<HEAD>Former Congressman Begins Prison Sentence in Wedtech Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia surrendered to a
federal prison in Florida on Monday to begin serving a sentence for
his role in the Wedtech Corp. scandal.
   On Jan. 19, a federal judge in New York sentenced Garcia, 58, to
three years in prison, recommending his release on parole after six
months.
   Garcia and his wife, Jane, were convicted Oct. 20 of extorting
payoffs from Wedtech, a now-defunct defense contractor located in
Garcia's former district in South Bronx. Mrs. Garcia was given the
same sentence and is free pending an appeal.
   Garcia also is appealing, but decided to serve his sentence
before the appeal, said his lawyer, Sarah Chapman.
   She said Garcia surrendered to the Eglin Federal Prison Camp at
the Eglin Air Force Base near Pensacola. The prison warden's
secretary, Donna Davis, confirmed that Garcia arrived at the prison
Monday.
   Garcia, a six-term Democratic congressman, resigned after his
conviction. A special election to fill his seat will be held
Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Monday denied a mistrial
motion by John Poindexter that was triggered by a reference in open
court to testimony Poindexter had given Congress under a grant of
immunity.
   The information in the reference was ``not new at all,'' said
the judge in Poindexter's Iran-Contra trial.
   With Rep. Lee Hamilton on the witness stand, prosecutor Dan Webb
asked about a document, signed by then-President Reagan, indicating
missiles had been sent to Iran in 1985 to try to win the release of
Americans held in Lebanon.
   Had Poindexter ever reported destroying the document? Webb asked.
   ``He did,'' Hamilton said in front of the jury.
   In other testimony, Hamilton said the late CIA Director William
Casey denied the very existence of the document in congressional
testimony _ a denial that was not true and a denial that had not
been known before.
   The congressman, co-chairman of a special congressional
committee that investigated the Iran-Contra affair, was referring
to Poindexter's July 1987 testimony to the committee, during which
he said he tore up the document.
   No part of the case against Reagan's national security adviser
may be derived from his testimony to Congress, given under a grant
of immunity from prosecution.
   As soon as Hamilton answered the question on Monday, another
prosecutor, Howard Pearl, stood up and Webb quickly said ``I see
the problem.''
   Webb rephrased the question, but Poindexter lawyer Richard
Beckler later asked for a mistrial, saying that Hamilton had
specifically been instructed not to refer to Poindexter's immunized
testimony.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene denied the motion, saying that
Oliver North testified last week that he watched Poindexter tear up
the finding.
   Greene said Hamilton's testimony was ``cumulative rather than
harmful.''
   Beckler suggested the jury might not find North's testimony
credible. But Greene also noted that ``both the government and the
defense referred to tearing up of the finding'' in their opening
statements to the jury.
   ``And you have great credibility,'' Greene told Beckler.
   The information about tearing up the finding ``is not new at
all,'' Greene concluded.
   In November 1986, Hamilton had been chairman of the House
Intelligence Committee that met with Poindexter to discuss U.S.
arms sales to Iran.
   The congressman said the national security adviser made no
mention of a U.S. role in the November 1985 shipment of Hawk
missiles to Iran. The CIA-assisted delivery was authorized by the
Reagan ``finding'' that Poindexter destroyed hours after testifying
before the committee.
   Casey, who prepared the finding for Reagan, appeared with
Poindexter before the committee.
   ``Do you remember Casey in that testimony actually telling you
there was no finding for that 1985 shipment'' of Hawk missiles to
Iran? Webb asked Hamilton.
   ``I do,'' replied Hamilton.
   Webb asked Hamilton, ``Do you recall whether Admiral Poindexter
said he could reveal all the facts?''
   ``Admiral Poindexter said ... President Reagan wanted to tell
the full story,'' replied Hamilton.
   The finding that Poindexter destroyed depicted the U.S. role in
Iran arms sales as a straight arms-for-hostages deal, the kind of
arrangement the Reagan administration declared it would never allow.
   Poindexter told the Intelligence Committee members that the U.S.
government didn't learn until January 1986 of the missile shipment,
according to notes taken at the meeting by a congressional staffer.
   Hamilton said Poindexter read verbatim a January 1986
presidential finding that did not portray the Iran initiative as a
straight trade of arms for hostages.
   Poindexter ``only told you about the January finding?'' asked
Webb. Hamilton replied that had been the case.
   ``Did John Poindexter ever tell the committee that the U.S.
government had been involved in Iran arms shipments before the date
of this finding?'' asked Webb.
   ``No, he did not,'' answered Hamilton.
   ``John Poindexter, in the briefing session, did he ever tell
about another presidential finding, one that was actually signed by
the president in 1985 relating to U.S. involvement in another arms
shipment?'' asked Webb.
   ``He did not,'' said Hamilton.
   Earlier, Hamilton testified that Poindexter endorsed false
answers by his predecessor as national security adviser, Robert
McFarlane, which denied that North was supplying the Contras with
military advice or raising money for them.
   Poindexter sent a letter to Hamilton in the summer of 1986
referring to McFarlane's denials of the previous year.
   ``I understood that John Poindexter was ... restating the same
denials we had from Mr. McFarlane ... there was no doubt in my mind
about that,'' Hamilton said.
   Webb said North testified last week that McFarlane's answers
were ``all false.''
   Hamilton also testified that ``the system simply doesn't work''
if officials ``lie to one another.''
   Asked by Webb whether ``John Poindexter or Oliver North ever
had'' a right to lie to Congress, Hamilton replied, ``They did
not.''
   Does the system work if officials lie to Congress? asked Webb.
   ``The system simply doesn't work if we lie to one another in
government,'' replied Hamilton.

   Israel TV said Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
holds the best chance of being tapped to form a new government
after the ultra-Orthodox parties split Monday over backing his
right-wing Likud bloc or the Labor Party.
   The religious parties hold the key votes on who will lead the
government.
   The spiritual leaders of the ultra-Orthodox Shas, or Torah
Guardians, and Torah Flag parties held a crucial meeting and
decided to back Shamir, Israel radio said.
   Earlier Monday, leading rabbinical scholars of the small
ultra-Orthodox party Agudat Israel decided to throw their support
behind Shimon Peres' left-of-center Labor Party.
   Shas leader, Interior Minister Aryeh Deri, indicated Monday on
army radio that Shas' support for Likud was conditional on
acceptance of proposals of U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker
III for convening Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
   Likud's objections to Baker's proposals were what brought down
Shamir's government last Thursday by a 60-55 no-confidence vote in
the 120-seat Parliament.
   Israel TV said Monday's decisions by the ultra-Orthodox parties
tied Likud and Labor with 60 seats each. It takes 61 to form a
government.
   But the television said President Chaim Herzog now may well give
Shamir the nod to form a government because he controls the largest
faction in Parliament.
   Herzog is meeting with political leaders to chose who will form
the next administration. He is expected to invite the Shas faction
to his residence again Tuesday for clarification of who they
support, an Israeli official said.
   Shas helped topple the government last Thursday. It said Sunday
it was backing Likud, but did not recommend who should lead Likud
in setting up a coalition.
   The Israeli official, who spoke on condition of not being
identified, said Herzog could announce his decision by Tuesday
night or early Wednesday.
   Herzog will base his decision on whoever has the best chance of
forming a coalition government. Since a tie is reported, however,
he could give the mandate to the leader of the largest faction in
Parliament, which has been the practice in the past.
   Peres was initially expected to be Herzog's choice, but
complications rose with growing splits and indecision in the
religious camp over who to favor.
   Both large parties faced the difficulty of melding extreme
right- or left-wing factions into an uneasy coalition with
religious groups.
   Labor is Parliament's largest single faction with 39 seats.
Likud has 35, but also controls a five-seat Liberal faction that it
is trying to woo back into its ranks, making it the largest party.
   Transportation Minister Moshe Katzav of Likud maintained in
remarks made on Israel TV that Likud remains the largest party
since the Liberal breakaways still took part in all Likud functions.
   Rafi Edri, a former Labor minister, said on Israel TV that Labor
still believes it will be able to win over Shas becaause only a
Peres-led coalition could advance the peace process.
   Shas' spiritual leader, Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef, made a rare
television appearance Sunday night and assailed Shamir's Middle
East policies, saying they ``invited war and bloodshed upon
Israel.''
   ``How would I give an account standing in judgment before the
Creator, for the blood spilled, without knowing I tried to avoid
it?'' asked Yosef, who is also a former chief rabbi of Israel's
Sephardic community _ Jews of Middle East origin.
   While its abstention in the Thursday vote gave victory to Labor,
Shas has had a steady alliance with Likud since Shas was founded in
1984.
   Agudat Israel, a party founded as an anti-Zionist movement in
Eastern Europe in the 19th century, is traditionally neutral on
foreign policy. It usually backs the party that pledges more
support for religious institutions.
   Apprehensions are growing in both Labor and Likud that a
prolonged stalemate could force Parliament to move up national
elections now scheduled for 1992.
   Shamir remains caretaker premier until a new government is
formed or elections are held. Israeli law allows a maximum six
weeks for whichever party leader is chosen to form a new government.

   The government said Monday it is setting up a
special war crimes unit of police officers to investigate alleged
World War II atrocities committed by people now living in Britain.
   Home Secretary David Waddington said the British police had
never investigated war crimes before and the unit would work in the
same way the police investigated ``any other criminal activities.''
   He said police, legal authorities and the courts would have the
responsibility for prosecutions, trials and convictions and the
government would not interfere.
   Waddington made his announcement in the House of Commons, which
voted 273-60 Monday to approve in principal legislation that would
make prosecutions possible despite the long lapse of time since the
war ended in 1945.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher backs the bill, which has to go
through further procedures before it becomes law. When the
legislation was introduced earlier this month, government officials
said the first trial might be held before the end of this year.
   ``It is so long since the war and the instinctive wish of most
of us is to get on with our lives in peace and not to rake over the
past, let alone the pasts of men who have lived peacefully in this
country since before some members of Parliament were born,''
Waddington said.
   ``But sometimes one is brought face to face with facts that
cannot be buried, with deeds so terrible that they cannot be
forgotten. And as long as one of those responsible survives, the
world will cry out for justice.''
   The Simon Wiesenthal Center, based in Los Angeles, gave lists of
suspects to the British government in 1986 during controversy over
the World War II role of Austrian President Kurt Waldheim when he
was a German Army officer.
   A British inquiry last year exonerated Waldheim of complicity in
the executions of British prisoners of war in the Balkans where he
was serving.
   A separate government-ordered inquiry said there was sufficient
evidence to prosecute three suspects living in Britain. It also
urged the investigation of 124 others who came to Britain with
thousands of displaced persons after the war.
   British news reports have said all the suspects in Britain are
from the Soviet republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Ukraine, where
the Nazis recruited killer squads and massacred thousands of people.
   New war crimes trials are opposed by Lord Shawcross, who as Sir
Hartley Shawcross was British chief prosecutor at the Nuremberg
trials of leading Nazi war criminals.
   ``To raise all these issues and spend an enormous amount of
money to convict three or four old men and send them to die in a
prison hospital is counter-productive and not worthwhile,'' he said
in statement.
   Shawcross, 88, said the trials would revolve around evidence of
identification, which was ``notoriously unreliable'' at the best of
times and even more so after 45 years.

<HEAD>Havel Visits France for Talks With Mitterrand</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel expressed
optimism Monday that the desire for German unification shown by
East German voters will push all of Europe toward confederation.
   ``I think that the most important thing resulting from the
election in East Germany is that unification will take place,''
Havel said on the French television network TF-1 before a state
dinner with President Francois Mitterrand.
   ``What's important for Czechoslovakia as well as many
neighboring countries ... is that it take place in a European
context,'' he said at the Elysee Palace. ``Germany can be the motor
of European unification.''
   Havel and Mitterrand met for a private, hourlong discussion
during the day, shortly after the Czechoslovak leader arrived for a
two-day visit.
   They found a ``broad convergence'' of views on the French
leader's proposal of a political and security confederation linking
Eastern and Western Europe, Mitterrand spokesman Hubert Vedrine
said.
   Mitterrand envisions a confederation within the 35-nation
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. It includes the
United States, Canada and all European nations except Albania.
   The conference met Monday in Bonn, West Germany, for monthlong
security talks. Chancellor Helmut Kohl called on member countries
to work toward a common European economy and security system.
   Havel's visit is his first to France since becoming
Czechoslovakia's leader in December after a peaceful revolution
ended four decades of Communist rule.
   Havel has rejected neutrality for a unified Germany and says he
envisions a common European security system free of both the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact.
   ``The future European system shoud be founded on the principle
of multipolarity ... a system where the Lithuanians and the Irish,
as well as the Germans and the French, will feel secure,'' he said.

   The Kremlin on Monday sternly warned the breakaway
republic of Lithuania not to put up its own customs posts,
introduce its own currency or take over Moscow-run factories
without permission.
   The nationally televised announcement was Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
first concrete step to counter Lithuania's March 11 declaration of
independence. The announcement did not say what would happen if
Lithuania ignored the orders.
   Despite the harsh words, Lithuanian President Vytautas
Landsbergis said in a statement issued by the republic's parliament
late Monday, ``I think this is an introductory stage of
negotiations.''
   He added that his government agreed with elements of Moscow's
statement, including the value of maintaining economic ties between
Lithuania and the Soviet Union.
   Earlier Monday, a Lithuanian delegation delivered a letter to
the Kremlin that promised Soviet interests in the republic would be
given ``careful consideration.''
   A spokesman for the Lithuanian nationalist movement Sajudis,
Lionginas Vasiliauskas, said in Moscow that 10 truckloads of Soviet
troops were moved Monday from Kaunas, about 60 miles from Vilnius,
to a military post just outside the capital.
   There have been unconfirmed reports the past several days that
Radio Vilnius had been either jammed or replaced with Russian
programs. A loud hum could be heard during a broadcast monitored in
Washington Monday night.
   ``We have reliable information that in the past few days, Radio
Vilnius broadcasts to foreign countries have been blocked by Radio
Moscow,'' the broadcast said.
   It said Radio Moscow had been informed and that officials there
seemed surprised. ``This suggests that perhaps the blockade of
Radio Vilnius broadcasts abroad was not conducted by Radio Moscow,
but rather by the Minister of Communications of the U.S.S.R. But so
far, no answer from that ministry has been received,'' the
broadcast said.
   The Kremlin's television statement accused the Lithuanian
leadership of planning to turn over national factories to private
owners, bring in a separate currency and put up customs posts on
the borders of the republic.
   It said the government was concerned especially about nuclear
energy plants in Lithuania and had ordered increased security
around them.
   It accused the Baltic republic of trying to ``undermine its
links'' with the rest of the Soviet Union, which it said could have
``pernicious consequences'' for the national economy.
   The government said police, the KGB and customs agents would
have authority in maintaining the existing customs situation.
   A directive was issued to the management of all Soviet
enterprises and agencies in Lithuania, saying under no
circumstances should they begin negotiations on handing over their
authority to local officials. Such talks can only be run by Moscow
ministries, it said.
   Many Lithuanians say they expect Moscow to impose an economic
blockade, depriving the republic of the fuel and raw materials it
receives only from the Soviet Union.
   The government statement contained no such threats.
   Gorbachev and the Congress of People's Deputies _ the national
parliament _ declared the declaration of independence invalid last
week, but Kremlin leaders have ruled out use of troops in Lithuania.
   Lithuanian activist and television editor Eduardas Potashinskas
said he thought most Lithuanians would take the government warning
calmly.
   ``We say the Soviet empire is showing its teeth,'' he said by
telephone from the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius. ``But we think they
can't threaten Lithuania. We'll be calm. We'll fall and get up, but
we'll go on.''
   On Sunday, Soviet jets buzzed Vilnius in what many Lithuanians
consider an intimidation tactic, and maneuvers were carried out in
the countryside. Residents said Monday the maneuvers appeared over.
   A Soviet spokesman in Moscow said the military maneuvers were
not extensive and had been planned long in advance.
   But Landsbergis told Lithuanian legislators Monday the exercises
added to tensions with the Kremlin.
   He said he asked high-ranking Soviet officers Sunday if he would
be notified in advance of future maneuvers. One of the officers
replied that he could not make guarantees.
   The Bush administration said Monday it would keep an eye on
Soviet military activities in the Baltics. The White House and
State Department spokesmen urged a peaceful approach to secession
and reminded Gorbachev he had said force would not be used.
   Lithuania's parliament voted overwhelmingly March 13 to secede
from the Soviet Union and regain the independence it enjoyed before
being forcibly annexed by the Kremlin in 1940, along with Estonia
and Latvia.
   The TV statement said the government sympathized with
Lithuania's desire for greater sovereignty, but it said this should
only be pursued together with ``strict observance of Soviet laws
and taking into consideration the mutual interests of the peoples
of Lithuania and other republics.''
   Soviet TV has broadcast several segments the last two days
focusing on discontent among non-Lithuanians, who comprise about 20
percent of the republic's 3.7 million people.
   On Monday evening, the nightly news program ``Vremya'' showed a
mass meeting against Lithuanian independence in the city Klaipeda.
One speaker complained, ``We don't want to live in bourgeois
Lithuania.''
   A ``Vremya'' anchorman also read an appeal from a demonstration
held Sunday in Vilnius that drew tens of thousands of Lithuania's
Russians, Poles and other ethnic minorities.
   ``Hypocritically and arrogantly, the interests of many thousands
of people who are categorically against being torn from the peoples
of the U.S.S.R. are being ignored,'' it said. It was addressed to
Gorbachev.
   The appeal expressed the hope that Gorbachev would ``be able to
defend your fellow citizens from the encroachments of political
adventurists.''
   Gorbachev has said he is willing to carry on a ``respectful
dialogue'' with Lithuanian representatives, and he reportedly met
personally with a Lithuanian delegation that arrived in Moscow.
   The six-member delegation was headed by Egidius Bickauskas, a
lawyer who recently resigned from the Lithuanian Communist Party.
   It was empowered by Lithuania's parliament to meet with
Gorbachev and propose a start of negotiations on independence, said
a Sajudis spokesman.
   Delegates from independence-minded Estonia were also in Moscow
on Monday to discuss independence. Lawmakers favoring independence
are expected to dominate Estonia's new parliament, which was
elected Sunday.

   A woman who once claimed she was David
Letterman's wife was charged Monday with breaking into the
talk-show host's home for a sixth time _ two days after her release
from prison for an earlier break-in.
   Margaret Ray, 37, of Crawford, Colo., was arrested at 12:46 a.m.
Monday and charged with first-degree trespassing when she was found
near the tennis court on Letterman's property, said police Sgt.
Nick Warren.
   Letterman called to report seeing her in the hallway of his
home, Warren said.
   Warren said Ray had also been there the day before. Letterman
had called Sunday to report a broken window, and when police went
to investigate, they found her in the house, escorted her off the
property and warned her not to come back.
   Ray was held overnight on $1,000 bond and taken to Norwalk
Superior Court on Monday afternoon, where a psychiatric evaluation
was ordered, said a spokeswoman in the public defender's office.
Ray was taken to the Niantic State Prison for women and is due back
in court April 4.
   It was Ray's sixth arrest in two years for bothering the host of
NBC's ``Late Night with David Letterman.''
   She was released last Friday from the Niantic prison, where she
had served seven months of a nine-month sentence for trespassing at
his home last August, said William Flower, a Department of
Correction spokesman.
   An NBC publicist, Rosemary Keenan, said Letterman had no comment
on the arrest.
   Ray, who last year described Letterman as the ``dominant figure
in my life,'' was first arrested in May 1988, when she was stopped
driving his Porsche near the Lincoln Tunnel in New York City. She
identified herself as Mrs. Letterman and her son as David Jr. when
she was unable to pay the $3 toll.
   Authorities said she took the car after breaking into his house
and setting up housekeeping. Letterman initially declined to press
charges, but she was charged with trespassing when she returned a
second time.
   Ray was arrested again on Feb. 24, 1989, and four days later
when she was found again on the property. She pleaded guilty in
June and was sentenced to three years' probation, to be served in
Colorado.
   But police nabbed her a fifth time on Aug. 24. The following
day, she was sentenced to nine months in Niantic for violating her
probation.

automatic operator before moving into the technical field.
   He transferred to Albuquerque, N.M., in 1938 and returned to
Columbus a year later.
   In 1957, Mowery was named Ohio traffic bureau chief, the title
then used for the AP technical department. The title was later
changed to chief of communications. He retired in 1976.
   Mowery is survived by his wife, Kay; two sons, Gerald, of
Washington, D.C., and William, of Sunbury, Ohio; a daughter,
Kathleen Baumann of Grandview in suburban Columbus; 19

   At least 26 people died in
black factional fighting and clashes with police, including 15 men
killed when a mob destroyed a Zulu tribal chief's compound, police
said Monday.
   A mob on Sunday attacked the chief's kraal _ or homestead _ at
Njobokazi near Hammersdale in Natal and slaughtered most of the
inhabitants and injured nine others, police said. Two black police
officers assigned to guard the chief were among the dead, they said.
   The attackers hurled hand grenades and opened fire with an AK-47
assault rifle and other weapons, police said. Inhabitants of the
kraal were gunned down as they fled, they said.
   Police reported 11 other people were killed Monday and Sunday,
most in factional fighting in Natal. Police firing shotguns killed
two men in separate incidents Monday while breaking up protests in
black townships, they said.
   African National Congress leader Walter Sisulu agreed Monday to
meet with Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi to try to halt growing
violence in Natal, the traditional home of the Zulus. The Zulu's
Inkatha movement has been fighting groups allied to the ANC for
dominance in Natal.
   But Buthelezi criticized Sisulu for insisting they meet in the
Natal town of Nongome, instead of the traditional Zulu capital of
Ulundi. Buthelezi said Sisulu's action was a snub to the Zulu
people and an attempt to belittle their history.
   ``In what way is he contributing to peace if he talks this way
to our people,'' Buthelezi said. Sisulu had no comment beyond
saying he hoped the meeting could be held soon.
   In the Njobokazi incident, local reporters who asked not to be
identifed, said the chief was a leader of Inkatha and the attackers
members of the ANC-backed United Democratic Front.
   About 3,000 people have been killed in Natal in recent years in
fighting between the conservative Inkatha movement and the radical
front. Both movements are anti-apartheid, but differ over the make
up of a future state, with the nationalistic Zulus supporting
separate national entities for different ethnic and tribal groups.
   More than 300 people have died in South Africa in a wave of
mainly black factional violence in the past month. The violence is
the worst to hit the country since major riots during the mid-1980s.
   The Citizen newspaper reported Monday that security officials
were worried about a possible violent white backlash against the
growing black unrest. At least one white has been killed and
several whites injured in recent days after being caught up in
black factional fights.
   Buthelezi said he was ready to meet with ANC leader Nelson
Mandela and possibly tour areas hit by violence with him to try to
end the unrest. Mandela, released last month after 27 years in
jail, went to Natal to appeal for an end to the violence, but the
fighting has not ended.
   Mandela has blamed the violence on what he says are repressive
policies of the white minority government.
   Mandela is to meet with President F.W. de Klerk's government
April 11 to try to set terms for constitutional talks on ending
white-minority rule and sharing political power with blacks.
   In other developments Monday, the government dropped terrorism
charges against eight people held for the three years on charges of
aiding ANC guerrillas and allegedly taking part in bombings.
   Government prosecutors said the eight had been acquitted because
of changes in the government case. Six other people charged in the
case face trial.

<DATELINE>SHAWINIGAN, Quebec (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two firefighters were killed Monday
after an explosion ripped through a five-story rooming house that
had already been engulfed in flames, police said.
   At least 11 people were injured, two critically, by flying
debris from what appeared to have been a natural gas explosion,
police Sgt. Florian Lafreniere said. The critically injured were
schoolchildren on their way home for lunch who were hit by falling
bricks, he said.
   The fire started at 11:30 a.m. in the downtown area of this
economically depressed industrial city, about 100 miles east of
Montreal.
   Roger Diamond, who works downtown, went to the scene to help
firefighters, who rescued people and at least one cat from the
upper stories of the rooming house.
   ``Suddenly a policeman yelled: `Look out, get out of the way,'
and there was a violent explosion,'' Diamond told the local radio
station.
   The fire had spread to another building and the adjacent Hotel
Shawinigan, and a wall of the hotel collapsed into the street. The
two dead firefighters were believed to have been buried underneath,
police said.
   The fire was under investigation. About 50 people were left
homeless by the blaze.
   ``We put out a call for people to take them in for the time
being,'' Lafreniere said. ``Most of them have a place to spend the
night and we'll take care of the rest of them.''
   The fire was declared under control late Monday afternoon, but
well into the evening firefighters battled the flames.

   A man arrested on a bad-check charge held
authorities at bay for 1{ hours Monday by pulling a gun on a
policeman and threatening to shoot himself in the back seat of a
patrol car.
   No one was seriously hurt, and Billy Ray Youngblood, 38, of
Muskegon surrendered, said police Lt. Dan Stout.
   The incident began around 12:22 p.m., when police were called to
a hotel in this city along Lake Michigan on the bad-check
complaint, said Stout.
   After being put in the cruiser, Youngblood pulled a gun from a
handbag and ordered Patrolman Louis Hood to drive him to suburban
Norton Shores, Stout said. But Hood escaped.
   As Hood fled, Youngblood fired a shot through the cruiser's rear
side window. Hood, hit by shattering glass and metal fragments, was
treated for cuts at Hackley Hospital and released, said emergency
room clerk Beth Taylor.
   Youngblood kept police back by putting the gun in his mouth and
to his temple and threatening to shoot himself.
   The standoff ended when Police Chief Thomas Kelenske of nearby
Roosevelt Park persuaded Youngblood to surrender.
   Youngblood was being held in the Muskegon County Jail pending
arraignment on an attempted murder charge, Stout said.

   While Imelda Marcos has drawn the most attention
in the weeks leading up to the start of her trial Tuesday, her
co-defendant, Adnan Khashoggi, is hardly a minor player.
   Once reputed to be the world's richest man, the 54-year-old
Saudi financier is said to have been the main financier and
middleman of the Iran-Contra affair, in which proceeds of illegal
U.S. arms sales to Iran went to rebels fighting the Nicaraguan
government.
   Khashoggi's lawyers say his holdings have diminished in recent
years, but don't dispute that he's still a millionaire several
times over.
   Extradited from Switzerland on July 19, Khashoggi posted $10
million bail so he could live in his luxury apartment on Fifth
Avenue. He promised to stay in the country to face charges that he
helped Mrs. Marcos and her late husband, deposed President
Ferdinand Marcos, defraud the Philippine treasury.
   Khashoggi has been seen dining in the city's most expensive
restaurants and has taken trips with the court's permission to
Southern California, Aspen, Colo., and Florida. He wears an
electronic bracelet to alert authorities if he ventures beyond a
prescribed distance.
   The trial of Khashoggi and Mrs. Marcos begins Tuesday with jury
selection. Both have pleaded innocent.
   The Marcoses were accused of stealing more than $100 million
from the Philippine treasury to buy real estate and art in New
York. Ferdinand Marcos died Sept. 28 in exile in Hawaii.
   Khashoggi, who allegedly posed as the owner of some of the
assets as a cover, was indicted on charges of racketeering,
conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction of justice. However, the
Swiss government agreed to extradite him only on the last two
charges.
   He faces up to five years in jail and a $250,000 fine on each of
the two charges of mail fraud and obstruction of justice.
   Mrs. Marcos' attorney, Gerald Spence, said Monday he might
subpoena former president Ronald Reagan to testify for Mrs. Marcos.
   ``Certainly the former president is a potential witness in the
case depending on what the prosecution's proof is,'' he said. ``The
former president and Nancy Reagan were friends of the Marcoses.''
   Reagan fought a subpoena to testify for the prosecution at the
trial of former national security adviser John Poindexter, who
faces charges stemming from the Iran-Contra affair. But the judge
ordered Reagan to give a sworn videotaped statement.
   Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said the former president had no
comment on Spence's statements. ``It is our longstanding policy not
to comment on pending court cases,'' Weinberg said.
   Mrs. Marcos is accused of taking part in the illegal transfer of
more than $160 million. The October indictment also alleges she
defrauded $165 million from banking institutions to finance the
properties.
   She is charged with racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail
fraud and obstruction of justice _ which carry a maximum sentence
of 50 years in prison and a $1 million fine.
   According to the indictment, Khashoggi's alleged role in the
fraud began after the Marcoses relocated to Hawaii in February 1986
when Marcos was ousted in a popular revolt.

<HEAD>Denver, Continental Sign Agreement on New Airport</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT MAXWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines ended a nearly year-long
dispute with the city Monday over financing of Denver's new $2.3
billion airport with an agreement calling for a new design to suit
Continental's needs.
   The city also agreed to cap per-passenger fees charged
Continental and to build $100 million worth of support facilities
for the airline, which will repay the city through a 30-year lease
agreement.
   The airport, expected to be second in size only to Chicago's
O'Hare when it opens in 1993, would be the nation's first new major
airport to be built since 1974, when the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport
was completed.
   At a news conference to announce the deal, Denver Mayor Federico
Pena said the agreement will ensure the partnership of a major
corporation in the operation of the airport, to be located about 15
miles northeast of Denver.
   ``The agreement we signed today ends all the disputes and
wrangling over the past several months between Denver and
Continental Airlines,'' Pena said.
   Pena and Continental chairman Frank Lorenzo signed the agreement
after several days of long-distance conference calls between
airport planners and Continental executives.
   The city still is trying to reach a similar agreement with
Denver's other major air carrier, United Airlines.
   The agreement calls for Continental to enter a 20-year lease
with Denver for 30 gates and 15 commuter plane parking spaces at
the airport. The airline will enter a separate, 30-year lease to
repay the city for $100 million worth of support facilities that
will be built by the city and used by Continental at the new
airport. The support facilities will include a maintenance
facility, a cargo building and a flight kitchen.
   The agreement will save Continental from having to obtain its
own financing to build the facilities, and from paying millions of
dollars in interest.
   Instead, the city will float revenue bonds to pay for the
building project, and Continental will repay the city.
   The city agreed to redesign the terminal in order to put
Continental's concourse _ one of three planned at the new airport _
closer to its ticket counter. Under the new plan, all of
Continental's gates are attached to the terminal building, instead
of being in an outlying concourse.
   Denver plans to begin selling up to $800 million in bonds next
month to finance the initial phase of airport construction.

<DATELINE>SEABROOK, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seabrook nuclear power plant operators on
Monday began what was considered the first step toward initiating a
sustained atomic reaction in the plant's uranium fuel.
   Operators began diluting neutron-absorbing boron in the
reactor's primary cooling system, setting the stage for withdrawing
the 57 control rods from the reactor, spokesman Ron Sher said.
   Withdrawing the control rods, which also absorb neutrons, would
raise the number of stray neutrons in the reactor core enough to
begin a sustained chain reaction of fissioning uranium atoms.
   Sher said the first fission in the fuel core since low-power
testing in mid-1989 would follow within ``tens of minutes'' with
the reactor operating at a fraction of 1 percent of full power.
   Sher said Monday afternoon that withdrawing the rods was ``some
time away,'' but could come early Tuesday. He said the timetable
was difficult to predict because plant personnel also were
performing final rounds of instrument and equipment checks.
   He said it's difficult to say precisely when the plant will move
beyond the ``system check'' mode because ``somebody doesn't say,
okay, now we're in the startup mode.'' But Sher said earlier this
month that diluting the boron could be considered the first
physical step toward initiating a chain reaction.
   The $6.5 billion plant, finished in mid-1986, finally got its
Nuclear Regulatory Commission operating license on Thursday,
following lengthy regulatory battles and a preliminary court
skirmish decided in Seabrook's favor.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington declined last week to
block the license pending further court action, but still must
consider an appeal filed by the Massachusetts attorney general,
Seacoast Anti-Pollution League and New England Coalition on Nuclear
Pollution.

<TEXT>
   Premier Li Peng opened the annual legislative
session on Tuesday by proclaiming China's present political and
economic policies would continue because, ``Only socialism can save
China.''
   Li, in speech of more than two hours to the nearly 3,000
deputies of the National People's Congress, also said the state
would exert more central controls over the economy, but would ease
austerity measures that have brought growth to a standstill.
   Li's state of the nation address sets the tone of the 15-day
meeting expected to show unwavering support for the party's
hard-line political and economic policies.
   Li began by noting the ``soul-stirring struggles'' of 1989,
including the victory over the ``counterrevolutionary rebellion'' _
the government's term for the student-led pro-democracy movement
crushed by military force last June.
   He said the democracy movement was led by hostile forces trying
to turn China into a bourgeois republic and a dependency of
developed capitalist countries.
   ``Only socialism can save China,'' Li said. If China turns
toward capitalism, ``a polarization of classes would inevitably
arise, the overwhelming majority of people would sink into poverty
and social unrest would prevail for a long time to come. Fraud,
degeneration and crime, inherent in a society of exploiting
classes, would spread unchecked.''
   Li, wearing a Western suit, was only occasionally applauded as
he spoke. Sitting behind him on the podium were about 150 senior
officials, including Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin,
President Yang Shangkun and members of the party Politburo.
   For the second straight year, senior leader Deng Xiaoping did
not appear at the opening session. Also missing was Zhao Ziyang,
the former party chief who was purged from all party posts last
year after being accused of supporting the democracy movement. Zhao
is still a deputy from Sichuan province.
   On the ideological front, Li said ``the influence of bourgeois
liberalization thinking and repulsive social phenomena still need
to be done away with.''
   China's open-door policy will continue, he said, but cautioned
that China must ``maintain sharp vigilance and resolutely combat''
the trend of Western-style democracy with a multiparty system.
   On foreign affairs, Li said China is ``naturally concerned about
the drastic political changes that have taken place in Eastern
Europe'' but hopes to maintain normal, friendly relations with
those countries.
   He said China hopes for improved relations with the United
States and the West. He criticized Western sanctions imposed after
the Tiananmen movement was suppressed and said China ``never yields
to external pressure and ... no one can succeed in isolating
China.''

<TEXT>
   The American mother of
7-year-old Hilary Foretich shielded her from the news media on
Monday and swore she would keep doing exactly that as he presses
her fight for the girl in an international custody case.
   Plastic surgeon Elizabeth Morgan of Washington, D.C., was
reunited over the weekend with her daughter 10 days after the
mother arrived in New Zealand to discuss the case with her lawyers.
   She has accused the father, dental surgeon Eric Foretich, of
sexually molesting the child and in 1987 began serving 25 months in
jail for refusing to reveal Hilary's whereabouts.
   Foretich denies the charges. He saw his daughter last week for
the first time in more than two years and has since returned to his
Falls Church, Va., home.
   Hilary was spirited to New Zealand 18 months ago to live with
her maternal grandparents, William and Antonia Morgan.
   Morgan flew from Auckland to Christchurch to be with her child
and her own parents. The group has been staying at a motel while
Hilary attends a private school.
   Morgan would not allow news media near her daughter following
the weekend reunion and pledged Monday to dodge the media as she
continues her fight for custody.
   Hilary's hiding place became the focus of world attention when
her father found her here three weeks ago.
   The New Zealand Family Court is to rule on the custody issue and
has barred reporters from covering the proceedings. No date has
been publicly announced for the hearing. Foretich and Morgan now
are divorced.
   Morgan refused to speak to the media Monday or let herself be
photographed with her daughter.
   She would not say how long she expects to stay in Christchurch
and had no comment to all other questions. She drove her daughter
the 200 yards from the Diplomat Motel to Selwyn House school Monday
after being alerted that photographers were waiting outside.
   She took a back route to the school Monday afternoon to whisk
Hilary home.
   Reporters have been ordered not to enter the grounds of the
Diplomat Hotel, Hilary's home since mid-1988.
   Also Monday, Morgan met her husband, U.S. Court of Appeals Judge
Paul Michel, at Christchurch Airport. Michel told The Associated
Press he arrived in Auckland on Sunday and spent the day talking to
his wife's lawyer, Lyn Stevens, and her senior U.S. lawyer Stephen
Sachs.
   Michel said he will stay in Christchurch for one week before
returning to Washington.
   He said he saw a ``good deal of Hilary for nearly a year before
she went in hiding.''
   But by late Monday he still had not seen the child at the center
of the bitter custody battle.

<HEAD>Family Appeals and Prayer Mark Fifth Anniversary of Anderson's
Kidnapping</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Friends and family of Terry Anderson marked
the fifth anniversary of his Beirut kidnapping March 16 as Lebanese
television stations played a poignant videotape of the daughter
he's never seen.
   In the tape, Anderson's 4-year-old daughter, Sulome, shows off
her ballet dancing and delivers a touching message for her father
and his captors, saying, ``I love you, Daddy, come home. Please
come home.''
   The girl appears wearing a green coat and riding a bicycle given
to her at Christmas in Anderson's name.
   ``I got the bike for Christmas, Daddy. Thank you,'' said Sulome.
She was born 83 days after Anderson, the chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, was seized by a pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslem faction in Beirut.
   Anderson, 42, is the longest-held of the American hostages in
Lebanon. All told, 18 Westerners are believed to be captives there.
   In a letter published by seven Beirut newspapers, Sulome's
mother, Madeleine Bassil, told Anderson that she and the girl also
feel like hostages. ``We are in as much captivity, Terry, only our
living space is bigger here and it's shared by millions,'' the
letter said.
   Relatives of the American hostages gathered for a commemorative
ceremony in Lafayette Park, across Pennsylvania Avenue from the
White House. In New York, friends and colleagues attended a Mass at
St. Patrick's Cathedral.
   Yellow ribbons fluttered from trees, signs and poles in
Anderson's hometown of Batavia, N.Y., and former hostages chained
themselves to a tree in Paris to protest Anderson's captivity.
   In Tokyo, members of the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan
raised symbolically empty glasses in a toast to Anderson. The
worldwide commemorative schedule included similar salutes at the
National Press Club in Washington, D.C., and at the Association de
la Presse International in Brussels.
   Anderson was assigned to the AP Tokyo bureau from January 1977
to August 1981.
   He has been held in windowless rooms in the slums of Beirut,
sometimes chained and blindfolded, former hostages say. During
Anderson's five years of captivity, his father and brother have
died.
   ``Who would have ever thought in their wildest nightmares that
this would last so long?'' said his sister, Peggy Say, who has
traveled to the Middle East and Europe trying to free her brother.

<HEAD>No Basis for `Wave of Speculation,' Bush Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on March 16 tried to dampen
speculation that the Western hostages in Lebanon might be released
soon.
   Bush, after a private meeting with Terry Anderson's sister,
Peggy Say, said he had no information about a release of the
captives and didn't want to needlessly raise the hopes of their
families.
   A day earlier he told the National Newspaper Association: ``I
wish I could tell you that there was a serious immediate effort
that would pay off, but that isn't the case.''
   Bush said he was perplexed by the ``wave of speculation'' this
month that hostages might be freed.
   Hopes were raised in part by statements attributed to Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani that he would like to see the hostages
freed.

<HEAD>Iraq Hangs Reporter Accused of Spying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq ignored international appeals March 15
and hanged a London-based newspaper reporter who was arrested near
a military complex and convicted of spying for Britain and Israel.
   Britain recalled its ambassador after the execution of
31-year-old Farzad Bazoft, an Iranian-born journalist who was
working for the British weekly The Observer and traveling on
British documents.
   Bazoft was arrested in September near a plant where ballistic
missiles are reportedly being developed. He was investigating
reports that hundreds of people had died in an explosion. Daphne
Parish, a British nurse who drove him to the military complex, was
also arrested and sentenced to 15 years in prison for complicity.
   Donald Trelford, the editor of The Observer, denied that Bazoft
was a spy and called President Saddam Hussein a barbarian.
   The execution, which followed a secret trial, came despite pleas
for clemency from Britain, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, Amnesty International, the European Community and
international press groups.
   After the execution, it was disclosed in Britain that Bazoft had
been convicted of bank robbery there in 1981. But British officials
said his criminal record did not diminish the London government's
outrage over the execution.

   Rising social and political unrest contributed
to the killings of at least 53 journalists in 1989, more than
double the number slain because of their work in the previous year,
a study released March 15 says.
   Two-thirds of the killings occurred in Latin America, including
14 in El Salvador alone, the Committee to Protect Journalists
reported. It labeled the slayings ``censorship by death.''
   The report was released the same day Iraq hanged Farzad Bazoft,
a London-based reporter accused of spying. Bazoft had been
investigating reports of mass deaths in an explosion at a military
complex.
   Another group, Freedom House, has put the number of journalists
killed last year at 73. The two monitors could not explain the
difference but noted that each uses its own sources of information
and methods of confirmation.

   China's leading daily newspaper on March 16
accused Western journalists of biased reporting and rejected their
complaints that they have been followed and harassed by undercover
police.
   The official People's Daily said some foreign reporters
``distort facts, spread rumors, maliciously attack the Chinese
government and deliberately jeopardize the security of the
country.''
   Correspondents from nearly a dozen countries, including the
United States and the Soviet Union, said they have been followed by
plainclothes police in recent weeks.
   They said police intimidation has interfered with their work and
that their Chinese contacts have been questioned by security
officials and told not to meet foreign reporters.

   A Portuguese journalist working for
Voice of America was ordered to leave Mozambique on March 16
because of a story he wrote, and the VOA said he departed for
France.
   The government had ordered Antonoio Mateus out of this southeast
African country, a former Portuguese possession, within 24 hours
for writing a story it said damaged Mozambique's image and
constituted ``active disinformation.''
   Information Minister Teodato Hunguana also said the story, filed
to LUSA, the Portuguese news agency, and the U.S.-based radio
network ``has no basis in fact.'' But other government departments
acknowledged that elements of the story were true.
   According to Hunguana, Mateus filed a story March 12 saying
military helicopters flew over the capital the previous Saturday
and that on Monday special police units patrolled the city
following ``rumors about the launching of a wave of protest against
the cost of living.''
   The Mozambican national news agency AIM quoted an official
source as saying it is routine for air force helicopters to fly
over the capital.
   Deputy VOA director Bob Coonrod said Mozambican authorities were
offended because Mateus refused to divulge the name of a senior

   The Pittsburgh Press Co. and its largest union
resolved their dispute over terms of a new contract March 14,
averting a possible disruption in delivery of the city's two major
daily newspapers.
   An agreement between management and Teamsters Local 211 was

   The agreement will result in the reduction by attrition and
retirement of about 60 jobs, as the company had sought, Kobell
said. Nearly all of the reductions will be in the transportation
and circulation departments. No layoffs will occur.
   The agreement also permits union members to apply to the

   The labor dispute had threatened the delivery of both the

   The National says its circulation and ad sales
are on target, and that it will boost distribution by 40 percent
soon by expanding in its first three markets: New York, Chicago and
Los Angeles.
   Publisher Peter Price said on March 15 the sports daily is
selling about 200,000 of the 250,000 copies it prints every day,
matching the target set for the paper.
   The National is distributed Sunday through Friday and plans are
to add six to 12 more cities by Dec. 31, when Price hopes a
half-million copies will be distributed every day.
   Advertisers have been told it will start printing a second
edition with a deadline three hours earlier than normal so papers
can be distributed the next morning on newsstands farther away from
the centers of its three markets.
   Media analysts say circulation confirmation from independent
auditing agencies is not yet available, leaving advertisers to rely
on the paper's word and anecdotal evidence of how things have been
going.
   Andrew White, a spokesman for Philip Morris Inc., which
advertises Marlboro and Parliament cigarettes in The National, said
he wants to see if the paper is a truly national publication and
whether circulation falls off on certain days of the week.
   ``The jury is still out on readership,'' said Joseph Ostrow,
worldwide media director for the advertising agency Foote Cone
Belding Communications.
   The number of advertising pages in the newspaper has been fairly
light, dropping off from double digits in the first week to an
average of four to five pages a day recently. But Price said that

<HEAD>Campaign Keeps Daily Tabloid in Business _ At Least for Now</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A daily newspaper that made a last-ditch
effort to stay in business by appealing for suscribers and
attacking its larger competitor has begun to attract new business,
its publisher said March 12.
   Green Bay News-Chronicle Publisher Frank Wood said the campaign
has attracted 900 new suscribers since last fall and may have
pushed advertising up as much as 50 percent in one month.
   ``We are still alive. It is an honest-to-God newspaper war and
we are badly outnumbered, but I think we still have a chance,'' he
said.
   Wood said last November that his 11,000-circulation morning
tabloid was doomed unless he found more subscribers and advertisers
to offset losses growing to $500,000 a year.
   His appeal came with a front-page attack on the Green Bay
Press-Gazette, the city's larger afternoon paper. Wood accused the
Press-Gazette of ``trying to destroy us'' and turn Green Bay into a
one-newspaper town.
   The publisher of the Press-Gazette, an afternoon broadsheet with
about 56,000 circulation, called Wood's attack ``a very unique
competitive move.'' Michael Gage, Press-Gazette publisher, said his
paper had lost 94 subscriptions directly in the battle with the
News-Chronicle. As for advertising, there has been a small impact,
but ``I couldn't give a dollars- and-cents figure,'' he said.

   Seeking to get the word out about its latest
promotion _ soft drink cans stuffed with prizes _ Coca-Cola Co. on
March 12 sent 200 reporters the real thing: samples containing $5
bills.
   Newsrooms are frequent recipients of promotional items sent from
companies trying to get publicity. But cash from a major
corporation is unusual.
   The ``Magic Summer'' campaign to promote Coca-Cola Classic will
include 750,000 randomly distributed cans, which appear to be
regular cans of Coke but when opened reveal a mechanism holding up
to $200 in cash or a certificate for other prizes.
   Bob Bertini, a spokesman for Coca-Cola USA, said the company
sent the reporters cans with $5 bills _ the smallest denomination
in the campaign _ merely to demonstrate the promotion.
   ``We sent it to a very small group of national writers. The
reporters can't write about it without seeing it,'' Bertini said.
   Many news organizations have policies against reporters
receiving gifts of value from news sources.
   Bertini said the company is urging reporters to donate the money

<HEAD>Court Hears Arguments in Case Against Twin Cities Newspapers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Minnesota Supreme Court was asked
March 13 to decide whether the state's two largest daily newspapers
are liable for damages for publishing the name of a source who was
promised anonymity by reporters.
   Attorneys for the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch and the Star
Tribune of Minneapolis asked the justices to overturn a Hennepin
County District Court jury's $200,000 damage award to Dan Cohen.
   An attorney for Cohen, meanwhile, asked the court to reinstate
the jury's $500,000 punitive damage award, which was overturned
last September by the Minnesota Court of Appeals.
   The dispute began in 1982 when Cohen gave reporters copies of
court documents showing that Marlene Johnson, who then was seeking
her first term as lieutenant governor, had been convicted of
shoplifting 12 years earlier.
   Johnson's conviction was vacated in 1971 with no sentence. She
was elected as Gov. Rudy Perpich's running mate in 1982, re-elected
in 1986, and is running with Perpich again this year.
   Cohen was working for rival gubernatorial candidate Wheelock
Whitney when he provided the information about Johnson on the
condition that he not be identified.
   Reporters gave him that assurance, but newspaper editors decided
to name Cohen as the source of the documents. Editors testified
that they named Cohen because they believed the public had a right
to know the information came from an Independent-Republican
activist.
   Cohen's lawsuit said he lost his advertising agency job because
of the resulting publicity.
   The Court of Appeals threw out the lower court's punitive damage
award but held that the First Amendment does not bar a breach of
contract claim in such circumstances.
   Attorney John Borger, representing the Minneapolis newspaper,
told the Supreme Court that First Amendment free press
considerations, not contract law, should govern the case. He said
the newspapers had to identify Cohen.
   ``What the public had to understand was how close to the Whitney
campaign the source of the information was,'' Borger said.
   The Supreme Court took the case under advisement and is expected
to rule in a few months.

Memphis, Tenn., have sought to open court records and transcripts
of a closed pre-trial hearing that was held March 9-10.

   Newspaper Guild members on March 19
overwhelmingly approved a three-year contract with the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch and called off a 12-day-old byline strike.
   Members of Guild Local 47 had been working without a contract
since the old one expired Feb. 28. The local, which represents
reporters, some editors, photographers, adverstising sales
personnel, business workers and clerks, voted 365 to 69 for the new
agreement.
   Reporters and photographers had withheld bylines and photo
credits since March 7 to protest an earlier, tougher offer from the
company.
   The contract calls for a 4 percent pay raise each year, a
drug-testing policy, a clause prohibiting strikes or lockouts, and
a $600 contract-signing bonus for each member, payable by April 13.
   It also calls for 21 employees to be exempted from Guild
jurisdiction, instead of the 26 exemptions the company asked for
last week.
   The contract gives the paper the right to hire free-lancers to
cover some news events and to hire advertising salespeople to sell
ads on a commission-only basis for the paper's zoned editions.
   The Guild was the sixth union to reach an agreement with the

   The electricians union at the Daily News is
looking over a three-year contract proposal, labor and company
officials said March 14.
   John T. Sloan, the newspaper's vice president for human

Electrical Workers was not one of the unions the News targeted
because of alleged featherbedding and overmanning.
   The contracts of all 10 unions at the paper expire March 30. The
News says it wants revisions in order to become profitable and
invest up to $500 million to build modern, color plants.
   The unions say the News wants to break them in order to become
profitable enough for its parent in Chicago, the Tribune Co., to
sell or close the paper.
   Christopher Erikson, a business representative for Local 3, said
the union was studying the proposal and that the next bargaining
session was not scheduled until March 22.
   In another development, a Daily News union leader said March 16
he will sue the newspaper for $5 million for what he described as a
libelous personal attack by Sloan.
   George McDonald, president of both the mailers union and the
Allied Printing Trades Council, accuses the executive of willful
defamation.
   Sloan called the threat of a lawsuit frivolous and ``another
publicity stunt.''
   The exchange apparently was prompted by a statement that Sloan
issued under the headline ``McDonald Sells Mailers Out.'' Sloan
said in the statement that McDonald had systematically ``given away
work traditionally performed by his own union to the drivers
union.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on March 19 refused to hear
a Bush administration appeal aimed at making it costlier for an
organization called the National Security Archive to compile
information.
   The archive is a non-profit organization that collects
information on national security and foreign policy and makes it
available to the public in various ways.
   It has filed thousands of FOIA requests for government records.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that gives the
archive the same preferential status under the Freedom of
Information Act that other news organizations enjoy.
   The administration claimed the archive should not have the
status of a news organization for purposes of FOIA requests.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last year that the
archive should be treated as a news media representative under the
FOIA because it publishes some of the information it gathers itself.
   News media representatives that make FOIA requests reimburse the
government for the cost of copying the documents, but not for the
major additional cost of searching for the records. If the archive
did not have the status of a news organization, it would have to
reimburse the government for search costs.
   The archive is headed by Scott Armstrong, a former Washington
Post reporter and co-author of ``The Brethren,'' a 1979 book that
provided a behind-the-scenes look at the Supreme Court.
   The organization published a book entitled ``The Chronology: The
Documented Day-by-Day Account of the Secret Military Assistance to
Iran and the Contras'' and another called ``El Salvador _ The
Making of U.S. Policy, 1977-1984.''

better not use the ``F'' word or their employer will be dipping

greater global understanding.
   Turner has instituted a company-wide standard requiring the use

   The company, which owns Cable News Network, has had a policy
against use of the word for the past 1{ years, but Turner amended
it the week of March 12 to include fines for slipups.
   ``The word `foreign' implies something unfamiliar and creates a
perception of misunderstanding,'' Turner said in a memorandum to
employees. ``In contrast, `international' means `among nations' and
promotes a sense of unity.''
   Employees who use the word ``foreign'' will be warned on the
first offense. Future slipups will mean a fine of $50, or $100 for

   Ramon Sanchez Parodi, a vice foreign minister, says Cuba may
curtail travel and telephone communications between Cuba and the
United States.
   Another possibility is that Cuba, with the use of high-powered
trnasmitters, will interfere with U.S. radio broadcasts over a huge

   Cuban officials argue the proposed station violates U.N.
agreements that protect local broadcasting systems from outside

Foundation, went to Donald C. Drake of The Philadelphia Inquirer;
Shannon Mililani Brownlee of U.S. News &amp; World Report; Michael
Skoler of National Public Radio; and Nippon Hoso Kyokai (NHK), the
Japan Broadcasting Corp.
   Drake was honored for a look at one patient's experience as part
of a trial of a new cancer therapy, and a story about two cancer
patients who received bone-marrow transplants.
   Brownlee won in the book and magazine category for an article
about genes that upon exposure to a virus or radiation cause normal
cells to become cancerous.
   The prize for broadcasting will be divided between Skoler and
NHK. Skoler won for a program on profit-making cancer institutes
that conduct expensive and experimental therapies on terminally ill
patients who are not eligible for other, more traditional therapies.
   NHK won for ``Protecting the Living Body _ The Immune System,''
one episode in a series ``The Universe Within.'' Katsuhiko Hayashi

the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange plummeting to a 14-month
low today.
   The dollar, meanwhile, rose sharply against the yen to a mark a
three-year high, fueled by the currency's bullishness in overseas
markets and Tokyo's poor performance.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which fell
55.20 points on Friday, plunged 1,353.20 points, or 4.15 percent,
today. Its closing of 31,263.24 was the lowest since it closed at
31,170.38 on Jan. 20, 1989.
   The Nikkei's decline today was the third biggest single-day
decline for the index. It plunged 3,836.48, or 14.9 percent, on

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is bound
for Africa's newest nation, Namibia, where he aims to mix
celebration with negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa and
to achieve a cease-fire in Angola.
   In six fast-paced days, Baker will visit three countries,
including South Africa _ the first secretary of state to go there
since 1978. He will fly to Cape Town on Thursday to show U.S.
appreciation for the preliminary steps taken by President F.W. de
Klerk and to try to drive him to go faster.
   To underscore U.S. support for the black movement Baker will go
on Friday to Soweto, the black township outside Johannesburg, for
talks there with Desmond Tutu, the black Anglican archbishop, and
other black leaders. Soweto has been the cradle of the
anti-apartheid movement.
   Baker's 25-hour flight to Namibia requires two refueling stops
before his arrival in Windhoek, the capital, where world leaders
are gathering for independence ceremonies. The country was pried
from South Africa's control with the help of U.S. diplomacy that is
now shifting its focus to Pretoria, where a white minority
government is being urged to dismantle racial segregation.

   Recently released records show that 87 members, including two
non-voting delegates, traveled abroad between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31,
1989. Well over 100 staff members also went overseas.
   The delegations went to some of the finest cities in Europe, to
the Third World, and in the case of two House Appropriations

millions of dollars in a daring theft from the Isabella Stewart
Gardner Museum.
   But experts say the paintings are so priceless, they're
worthless.
   ``People make pilgrimages to see these paintings. Scholars and
art lovers know where they belong,'' Constance Lowenthal, executive
director of the International Foundation for Art Research, said
Sunday.
   The theft occurred around 1 a.m. Sunday, when two men apparently

   The Japanese love to complain about their public
broadcasting behemoth, NHK, and millions have stopped paying the
fees that keep it on the air.
   A lawsuit has been filed against the network because of alleged
political partisanship by one of its prominent reporters. As for
non-payment of fees, an NHK spokesman said: ``We don't seek
punishment for those who refuse. We just appeal to their honest
nature.''
   The 66-year-old Japan Broadcasting Corp. _ better known as
Nippon Hoso Kyokai, or NHK _ is Japan's only national television
network. Monthly fees paid by owners of television sets are
supposed to cover its operating costs.
   NHK has a general-interest channel and another featuring science
and cultural programs. It is known for conservative programming and
unsmiling announcers who apologize with deep bows even for minor
mistakes in subtitles.
   No advertisements appear on NHK's channels, nor does it mention
brand names. The title of a popular song, ``Bright Red Porsche,''
was changed on a variety show to ``Bright Red Car.''
   Such programs as documentaries on the Silk Road, China's Yellow
River and the human body are acclaimed, but viewers say hours-long
live broadcasts of parliamentary debates are stultifying.
   Critics also say the network is too close to the governing
Liberal Democratic Party.
   ``If NHK were an ordinary company, the Liberal Democrats would
be the majority stockholders,'' media critic Masanori Atsuta said,
according to Themis magazine.
   A Cabinet-appointed committee names NHK's chairman and
Parliament approves the budget. NHK insists it is independent
otherwise, but investigative reporting that could embarrass the
government is left to commercial networks.
   The network has a staff of 15,000 and 93 percent of its budget
comes from public fees. It regularly loses money because of the
millions who refuse to pay.
   Daijiro Hashimoto, an NHK reporter and younger brother of
Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, is at the focus of the
network's latest woes.
   Hashimoto the reporter took part in his brother's successful
campaign for re-election to Parliament in February, prompting
allegations that he violated media guidelines of political
neutrality.
   Takehiro Motohashi, spokesman for NHK, said the network
``regretted'' its reporter's actions, but was not taking
disciplinary measures.
   Yokohama lawyer Masayoshi Hamada was sufficiantly angry to bring
legal action against the network. His suit claims NHK showed
favoritism by lending its name to a political campaign, and thus
has no claim to user fees.
   NHK will not comment on the case, but spokesman Motohashi made
the appeal to people's ``honest nature'' after noting that the
Broadcast Law requires the 33 million households with television to
pay the appropriate fees.
   Fees are $7.13 a month for a color televisions and $4.70 for
black-and-white sets, payable either a year in advance or by
monthly automatic bank transfers.
   Despite an income last year of $2.6 billion, NHK ran a deficit
of $167 million because of such costly new ventures as satellite
broadcasting, high-definition TV and teletext broadcasting. News
reports say the network wants a 28 percent rate increase.
   To mark households that pay their fees, NHK puts small stickers
on front doors. One anti-payment group sends out free stickers
saying ``NHK fee refuser.''
   ``I paid until about three years ago,'' said Keiko Watanabe, a
secretary who likes NHK shows. ``Why should I have to pay for NHK
and not others?''
   All NHK employees have to take their turn collecting bills ``to
impress on us that we survive on public donations,'' an NHK
reporter said.
   Salaries are low. The reporter, who did not want his name
revealed, said there is an inside joke that NHK stands for ``Nippon
Hakkyu Kyokai'' _ Japan Low-Wage Corp.
   Someone who is paid $32,000 a year at NHK would earn $47,000 at
TV Asahi, a commercial network based in Tokyo.
   ``In the countryside, everyone feels NHK's the best network
around,'' said a reporter from rival TBS. ``Kids there see our TBS
van and start shouting, `Look, it's NHK!' It's like God to them.''
   Yuko Saito, a housewife in rural Shizuoka prefecture 125 miles
southwest of Tokyo, leaves the set on NHK.
   ``Other networks are pretty silly,'' she said. ``My husband
thinks any news besides NHK is dumb, and my mother is glued to NHK
all day.''

   As she completes a decade in Congress,
protecting the environment remains a top priority for Rep. Claudine
Schneider of Rhode Island, an activist who made her name fighting
against a nuclear power plant in the 1970s.
   The rest of Congress is catching up, as lawmakers rush to
introduce bills to save the rain forest, stop global warming and
promote energy efficiency.
   But Schneider still is a step ahead, promoting the
re-structuring of U.S. defense forces to provide for what she calls
American ``ecosecurity'' in the face of new environmental threats.
   The country must prepare to defend itself against threats posed
by a growing population in a world with shrinking resources,
Schneider says. The threats will arise, she says, as soil erodes
and deserts creep into once-fertile regions, triggering famines.
   ``Hungry people cross borders. You get regional conflict. We
need rapid deployment forces for deserts and the tropics,'' says
Schneider. Providing ``ecosecurity'' will require a complete
reassessment of our national defense strategy, she says.
   Schneider, a Republican, has been a staunch environmental
crusader throughout her career. She has introduced legislation on
such disparate environmental issues as global warming, the loss of
tropical forests, the destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer,
ocean dumping, oil spills and hazardous wastes.
   Bills she has introduced to ban ocean dumping, encourage energy
efficiency by utilities and set energy standards for home
appliances have become law.
   On March 17, the National Wildlife Federation gave her its 1989
National Conservation Achievement Award for Legislation,
recognizing her ``outstanding leadership on a variety of
conservation and environmental issues.''
   She now is lobbying the Environmental Protection Agency to
institute a waste-end fee that would encourage industry to recycle
its wastes rather than dump them.
   ``We have the technology to recycle 75 percent of our waste,''
she says. ``The question is, why aren't we doing it?''
   As the nation prepares to celebrate the 20th anniversary of
Earth Day on April 22, Congress suddenly is brimming with ideas to
help the environment, Schneider says.
   ``There are a dozen different approaches,'' she says.
Legislators are considering bills to provide for the planting of
trees in cities, encourage energy efficiency, direct the World Bank
to promote conservation and double the budget of the United Nations
family planning program.
   ``I think we're going to see more environmental programs
focusing on international assistance,'' she says.
   The focus of legislation in the 1990s will shift from
controlling pollution to preventing it through such measures as
encouraging energy efficiency, she predicts.
   ``Pollution prevention pays,'' she says. ``Least-cost energy is
our promise for the future, for domestic and foreign policy.''
   So-called ``least-cost utility planning'' encourages utilities
to choose the most economical alternatives in providing new sources
of energy. It turns out, Schneider says, that improving energy
efficiency _ freeing wasted energy for new uses _ usually is
cheaper than building new power plants.
   At the same time, boosting efficiency cuts emissions of carbon
and sulfur dioxides responsible for global warming and acid rain.
``It's a win-win situation,'' she says.
   Schneider developed her ideas on ecosecurity when she was asked
three weeks ago to speak to a group of New York businessmen on the
possible uses of the ``peace dividend'' arising from defense
cutbacks as East-West tensions subside.
   ``I said there's another dynamic we should be thinking of.
Eighty-three percent of the world's population growth by 2010 will
be in China and the the tropics. The resource base is limited.
Certainly a piece of the national security picture for the future
must take population into account.''
   Environmental organizations have come to the same realization.
   ``More of the environmental groups are taking on the population
issue,'' she says.
   Schneider made her name in her home state in 1973 as the founder
of the Rhode Island Committee on Energy, a group that opposed and
eventually halted construction of a nuclear plant in Charlestown,
R.I.
   From 1973 until 1978 she was founder and executive director of
the Conservation Law Foundation, formed to represent citizens in
environmental disputes. In 1977, she became federal coordinator of
the Rhode Island Coastal Zone Management Program.
   She has traveled to wilderness areas in Madagascar and New
Guinea, and has penetrated deeper into the Amazon than any U.S.
government official since Theodore Roosevelt.
   The 1990s, Schneider says, will be the decade of information
transfer, the time to get the word out about new energy-efficiency
technology developed in the 1970s and 1980s.
   As part of a public-information campaign, she soon will have her
Capitol Hill office outfitted with the latest in energy-efficiency
lighting, including compact fluorescent bulbs that screw into
ordinary incandescent bulb sockets, providing just as much light
using one-fourth the energy.
   ``My frustration as a member of the science and technology
committee for the past 10 years has been to witness the development
of these technologies and seeing we do not have a good means, as a
government, to get the information out,'' she says.
   Or a means to remove practical roadblocks, as she found out when
she decided to redo her office.
   ``It took three years to get the architect of the Capitol to
approve it,'' she says. ``It's a situation, again, where we have
the technology and we haven't transferred it.
   ``The 1990s are a transfer time,'' she says. ``There are no
white hats or black hats. We're all in this environment together.''

   Martha Crisostomo was sleeping when eight
men in army uniforms, faces hidden by black ski masks, broke down
her front door.
   Her parents and neighbors, helpless, watched the men drag her
into the street and fire three bullets into her head and chest.
   Miss Crisostomo, a 22-year-old public health nurse, was slain in
September. She was the last witness to an army massacre of 29
peasants at Cayara village in May 1988.
   Eight other people who implicated the army in the massacre were
killed by soldiers earlier or detained and never seen again,
according to human rights organizations. Miss Crisostomo's parents
and friends told reporters of her murder.
   Human rights violatons by security forces have increased
dramatically in the campaign against the Sendero Luminoso, or
Shining Path, a Maoist group that began an insurgency 10 years ago
in the Andes region around this colonial town.
   More than 18,000 people have died in political violence since
1980. Most have been Indian peasants in the Andes, killed either by
rebels who accused them of betraying the struggle or by members of
the security forces who suspected them of sympathizing with
guerrillas.
   ``The death of Martha Crisostomo is concrete proof of the
outrageous way in which protection has been given to those
responsible for killing 29 peasants in Cayara,'' said Carlos
Escobar, a former civilian prosecutor whose assignment was to
investigate human rights violations in the Ayacucho region.
   He was fired by the Attorney General's Office when he
recommended the Ayacucho military commander and other officers be
prosecuted for murder in the Cayara massacre. Escobar also received
anonymous death threats.
   Shining Path guerrillas have extended their operations beyond
the Andes, even into Lima, and human rights monitors say the
government has begun to tolerate brutal military tactics in a
desperate effort to check the insurgency.
   They say torture, rape, disappearance of suspects and murder of
unarmed civilians have become trademarks of army tactics.
   Sen. Javier Valle Riestra, a member of the governing Aprista
Party who is a leading defender of human rights, said the military
establishment feels the death of innocent people is a price Peru
must pay to eradicate leftist terrorism.
   ``If 60 people are killed and 40 of them turn out to be
Senderistas, the military considers it a successful operation,'' he
said.
   In two detailed reports late last year, the human rights
organization Amnesty International said a ``pall of terror'' had
settled over much of Peru because of rebel atrocities and brutal
actions by government forces.
   President Alan Garcia and his civilian aides ignored the Amnesty
reports.
   The army routinely refuses comment on accusations of human
rights violations, such as the murders of Cayara witnesses. After
the Amnesty International reports, however, the Defense Ministry
denied any similarity between army conduct and the Shining Path's
``demented acts and criminal methods.''
   For three years, the United Nations has listed Peru as leading
the world in numbers of disappeared people, ahead even of
military-ruled countries.
   In the seven years since civilian governments began putting the
military in charge of insurgency zones in the Andes and the eastern
jungles, more than 3,000 people have disappeared after detention.
   Most human rights violations occur in military-controlled
regions, which have expanded to cover one-third of the country.
   Spanish-speaking soldiers from the coast, wearing black ski
masks, patrol the cold Andean heights and sweep into remote hamlets
of Quechua-speaking Indian peasants in search of rebels and
sympathizers.
   Community leaders say villagers dread the soldiers' arrival even
more than the nocturnal visits of rebel columns.
   Witnesses to the Cayara massacre told civilian investigators the
soldiers first stomped cactus on the bare backs of villagers,
demanding they identify rebel supporters, then killed them by
bashing their heads in with hammers or slashing their throats with
machetes.
   An army patrol slaughtered 69 peasants in Accomarca village in
1985, including 21 children under age 5. The second lieutenant in
command told congressional investigators ``children by the age 3
were potential Senderistas and it was his job to exterminate
them,'' said Se, head of the commission.
   The army said the officer would be given a private military
trial. Reporters discovered later he was promoted to first
lieutenan. Valle Riestrant and transferred to an army base in Lima, on
the coast
235 miles to the northwest.
   Human rights officials say brutal repression by security forces
plays into the hands of the Shining Path.
   ``The torture, the disappearances, the illegal executions all
reinforce the Shining Path's argument that this is an abusive,
fascist, genocidal state,'' Diego Garcia-Sayan, director of the
independent Andean Commission of Jurists, said in an interview.
   Lima newspapers n public outrage,'' Enrique Bernales, head of a
Senate commission on violence, said of Martha Crisostomo's murder.
   ``Are we no longer shocked by death?'' he said. ``Peru is
definitely a sick country.''

<HEAD>Director Turns Visit With Young Prosecutor into `Equal Justice'
Series</HEAD>

   A visit with a college roommate's sister in
Houston opened director Thomas Carter's eyes about criminal
prosecutors and led to the creation of ABC's ``Equal Justice.''
   ``She was a very unlikely assistant district attorney who at 26
or 27 was prosecuting felons,'' said Carter, who has made a career
of directing pilots for such series as ``Miami Vice,'' ``St.
Elsewhere,'' ``A Year in the Life,'' ``Midnight Caller'' and many
more.
   ``When I looked into it, I found the DA's office was a place
where very young lawyers got experience,'' he said. ``We've always
had this image in movies and television of prosecutors being tough,
older and male. I learned young lawyers spend six or seven years as
prosecutors, then move on. The salaries are low, the work is
intense, the burnout rate is high.
   ``These people have such an overwhelming caseload that people
fall through the cracks. Our show is about the cracks,'' Carter
said of ``Equal Justice.''
   Carter, who began directing while starring in ``The White
Shadow,'' set the unique visual style for ``Miami Vice.'' He was
much in demand as a director but, like a hired gunslinger, always
moved on after the pilot.
   He was looking for a series of his own and found it in ``Equal
Justice,'' which debuts Tuesday, March 27, with a two-hour pilot.
   Carter is the co-creator, executive producer and director, and
also played a small role in the movie. The series will be seen
beginning Wednesday, March 28, taking over the time slot of ``China
Beach,'' which moves to Mondays.
   ``Equal Justice,'' set in a big-city district attorney's office,
stars Cotter Smith, Joe Morton, Jane Kaczmarek, Sarah Jessica
Parker, Barry Miller, Debrah Farentino, Lise Cutter, James Wilder,
George DiCenzo and Kathleen Lloyd. Carter's co-creators were
Christopher Knopf and David A. Simons.
   Carter is in the forefront of a cadre of young directors who are
black, such as Kevin Hooks and Eric Laneuville, who got their start
acting in series.
   ``Race may be a problem for other people, but I don't let it
hold me back,'' he said. ``I don't look upon myself as a black
director _ I'm a director. Being a director is very personal
because you take with you your life and your experiences and your
views, and being African-American is an aspect of my character. But
it's not the sum of my life.
   ``I'm interested in so many things that are universal. How the
death of a person affects someone else. Love and relationships. I
want to explore a variety of themes as well as a variety of visual
styles. I think if you could sum up my work at all, you could say
it has a sense of romantic realism.''
   In the beginning, Carter knew he wanted to do a gritty, urban
show about the criminal justice system. He wanted it to have an
edge, be fast-paced and have a mixture of humor and dark tragedy.
   He returned to Houston for more research, then to New York,
where he visited all the boroughs, and to Chicago. He also talked
to some prosecutors in Los Angeles, although he wanted the story
set in an older city. The pilot movie was filmed in Pittsburgh.
   ``In our show, we don't deal just with the nuts and bolts of the
law, but with the politics of it as well,'' said Carter. ``I wanted
to do a show that would cause the American public never to look at
the law the same again.''
   Carter grew up in Texas, where he studied theater at Southwest
Texas State University.
   One of his first roles was as Ray Gun in ``Szysznyk,'' which
disappeared before anyone learned how to pronounce it.
   Next came ``The White Shadow,'' where he got his chance to
direct. He found it more challenging than acting and began to
direct many episodes of ``Hill Street Blues'' and ``St. Elsewhere.''
   ``I was surprised when I directed, because I didn't think I
would like it,'' he said. ``I came here to act. I thought if I
directed at all it would be much later.''

<HEAD>Prostitutes in Mali Teach Customers Dangers of AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAMAKO, Mali (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prostitutes have have taken up health
education, teaching customers how to protect themselves from
catching and spreading AIDS.
   Under an international program that began last year in this
Islamic nation, more than 1,000 prostitutes in Bamako, the capital,
have been receiving free condoms and information to pass along on
the job.
   About 350,000 Africans are believed to be infected with the HIV
virus. Most cases are in east and central Africa, where one in four
hospital beds is filled with a victim of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, for which no cure is known.
   Health officials hope to slow the spread of AIDS in Mali and
other West African countries before it reaches the same
catastrophic proportions.
   ``We have tried to go to countries where HIV prevalence is very
low, and you get your programs in place early,'' said Dr. Arlene
McKay of Family Health International, based in North Carolina.
   ``You try to avoid the situation you find in some countries
where up to 20 percent of the pregnant women in prenatal clinics
are suffering the disease,''
   Her non-profit biomedical, research and technical assistance
organization is working with risk groups in nine African countries
under a contract with the U.S. Agency for International Development.
   ``You need to get in early and reach the people who are most
likely to be practicing high-risk sex,'' she said.
   It is not easy.
   ``Officially, prostitutes don't exist in Mali,'' said Dr. Sidi
Konore, coordinator of the National AIDS Prevention and Treatment
Program.
   ``The number of people infected with AIDS is growing, and it is
clear something must be done'' despite political reluctance, he
said.
   Once a week, a female social worker visits four of Bamako's
largest brothels to distribute condoms, provide basic information
on sexually transmitted diseases and encourage women to take part.
   The program has grown significantly since it began with 140
prostitutes, only 11 of whom said they used condoms ``frequently''
with their clients. After three months, condom use was up to 90
percent among the 82 women who continued to participate.
   Their brothels also benefited by gaining a reputation for safety.
   Mary Bobbey, 36, went to work at a low mud-brick house in the
ramshackle Koura district after her husband left and took their
children, her mother got sick and the money ran out.
   She works in a small room with a dirt floor and corrugated tin
door, and said she may have 20 customers on a busy day.
   ``Not all of them want to use condoms,'' said Mrs. Bobbey, who
earns about $46 on a good day. ``It's very dangerous. Out of 20,
maybe five will refuse, and if one refuses I can't argue.''
   She and other prostitutes are banding together, driven by
sisterhood and common sense.
   Aminata Diakita, feeding her children under a palm tree in the
center courtyard, said the the women had decided everyone in the
house must participate.
   ``If there is a woman here who is not participating and she gets
sick, then the next day the guy will sleep with one of us and we'll
be sick,'' said Ms. Diakita, chosen by the program as the ``team
leader'' to help organize the house.
   ``Besides, if a man says he doesn't want to use one and
threatens to go next door, then we can say, `OK, but you'll have to
use one there, too'.''
   No one knows how many prostitutes in Mali are infected with
AIDS, which destroys the immune system and leaves the body
vulnerable to fatal disease. Figures on AIDS and other sexually
transmitted diseases are not released by the government.
   ``The original idea was to see if prostitutes would change their
behavior, and the answer seems to be yes,'' said Kathy Jesencky of
Family Health International.
   ``Clients are starting to accept the idea. We're now going to
start working with bar girls and women not in houses,'' she said.
``Using condoms is a habit one develops. The awareness is important
and in Mali awareness is increasing.''

<HEAD>Cycles of Hope Have Led to Cycles of Frustration and Silence</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Again, an anniversary, Terry Anderson's fifth
as a captive. Again, a cycle of hopeful signs and statements about
the American hostages in Lebanon.
   But optimism has proved hollow too often to come easily to the
families, colleagues and friends of Anderson and the other seven
Americans held captive by militant Moslem factions.
   Always before, cycles of hope have yielded to cycles of
frustration and silence. This time, perhaps, it will be different.
Peggy Say, Anderson's sister, thinks so. She is, she says,
absolutely convinced that the ceremony held last Friday, across the
street from the White House, will be the last before Anderson and
other captives finally are freed.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, was seized by Moslem gunmen on March 16, 1985. He has been
held longer than any other hostage. His kidnappers identified
themselves as members of a group called Islamic Jihad, or holy war.
They are aligned with Iran, and two hostages who had been held with
Anderson were released after secret Reagan administration arms
shipments to the Iranians.
   The scandal over the arms sales and diversion of the proceeds to
support Contra rebels in Nicaragua made the hostage situation part
of the major political embarrassment of the Reagan years. President
Reagan had, after all, defeated a Democratic president undercut by
the Iranian hostage crisis, and had promised that he would not let
Americans be taken without swift and sure retribution.
   There was no way to make good on that when Shiite Moslem
factions began seizing American and other foreign hostages amid the
unrelenting chaos in Beirut. All told there are now 18 foreign
hostages in Lebanon.
   As he took office, Bush urged the Iranians to help gain freedom
for the hostages, saying that goodwill would beget goodwill.
   At milestones along the way _ anniversaries, birthdays, the
release of other hostages, the Bush inauguration to succeed Reagan,
the death of Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini _ there have been cycles of
heightened public interest, of speculation and sometimes of
optimism about the release of hostages.
   In the latest round, which began about a month ago, a leading
Moslem cleric in Beirut said that a way should be found to free the
hostages, and Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani was said to have
declared that he would like the captives released.
   But the Moslem leader had said much the same thing more than a
year ago, near the fourth anniversary of Anderson's kidnapping.
Rafsanjani, as speaker of the Iranian parliament, had offered in
1989 to help gain freedom for the hostages if the United States
would work to free Iranians believed to have been captured by
Lebanese Christians.
   But there have been changes along with those similarities.
President Bush has put the hostage issue on the administration's
public agenda in a way the Reagan White House would not, especially
after the Iran-Contra scandal broke.
   He spent a half hour with Mrs. Say and her husband, David, on
Friday. Bush policy does not break with the course set in the
Reagan years, but his handling of the problem certainly does.
   ``I intend to keep open lines of communications with all
parties, including Iran, who have influence over hostage takers,''
Bush said in a letter to Mrs. Say. ``Please be assured that your
government will take advantage of all legitimate opportunities to
obtain the safe release of all of our hostages.''
   Bush also said he had been in touch with Syrian President Hafez
Assad regarding the hostages. His spokesman said later that was
through diplomatic channels, and that there have been other
overtures to Middle Eastern leaders on the hostage situation.
   Jimmy Carter met with Assad last week, and Bush said he had
received reports from the former president. Carter said in Damascus
that Assad told him Syria was seeking to convince the captors the
hostages should be protected and released.
   Carter said in Damascus on Friday that he thinks there is a
better chance of Anderson's release than ever before. He said that
stems in part from a growing desire on the part of Iran and the
United States to settle their differences.
   For all the differences in this cycle of hope, there are
similarities to those that went before. There are more contacts,
and changing circumstances. But there is nothing firm, only an
atmosphere, and conjecture.
   Bush said that he had been confused by all the speculation about
a possible break in the hostage situation. ``We are going down
every alley, we are trying every avenue to free the hostages, but
there is no negotiation going on,'' he said.

<HEAD>Miners Live With Rats and Rotting Timbers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI LOIKO</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DONETSK, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rats run free, broken timbers stab out
of the darkness and men stand in mud, breathing bad air, stripped
to the waist. That's how it is in a Ukrainian coal mine, 1,500 feet
below ground.
   The men of the Trudovskaya mine say life on the surface isn't
much better. Their shoddy housing has no running water and the
stores have little to sell.
   Many die early, killed by accidents, cancer or black-lung
disease. They retire at 50, if they live that long.
   Thousands of miners in the Ukraine, and in the Siberian coal
fields of the east, shocked Mikhail S. Gorbachev's Kremlin and the
economy last summer with the first industrywide strike.
   Eight months and countless promises later, the original
bread-and-butter demands have become political.
   After a month of rallies and hunger strikes against the local
Communist Party leadership, Ukrainian miners handed the party a
stunning setback in elections March 4.
   ``Look how I live!'' said Nikolai Golik, 36, who has two
children. ``Our conditions are not much better than down here in
the pit. There is no gas, no hot water. We ain't got a damn indoor
toilet.''
   Sergei Malchenko, 26, shares his comrade's bitterness.
   ``Gorbachev is showing off,'' he said. ``He is not doing
anything. I didn't go vote because I don't want to play those
games. Nothing good will come of it. For 72 years, Communists have
been pulling our legs, and finally have mucked it all up. I won't
help them. Not me.''
   The Trudovskaya mine is one of 21 in this eastern Ukrainian city
of 1.2 million people. In it, 3,500 miners work six-hour shifts
around the clock to meet a yearly quota of almost 1.5 million tons
of hard coal.
   Andrei Slivka of the Donetsk strike committee, said working
conditions have barely changed in his 19 years underground.
   In the shaft, sections of wall show signs of caving in. Broken
timbers protrude in all directions. Muddy water is underfoot
everywhere.
   Poor-quality wood brought in to prop up the shafts breaks
easily. Hastily built scaffolding often is flooded and slippery, so
miners must jump from board to board.
   Rats lurk in the flickering light of miners' lamps, waiting for
a chance to snatch leftovers from lunch.
   On the surface, the temperature is 41 degrees Fahrenheit. In the
shaft it is 77 degrees.
   Men dig with shovels, drills and picks. They crouch, squat,
crawl to scoop up coal in a narrow tunnel too low for a them to
stand straight.
   Sweat pours down their faces in black streams.
   There is an alarm system to warn of explosive gas, but miners
suspect it doesn't work. An explosion at the Pochenkov mine in same
coal basin killed 13 miners and injured more than 20.
   Boris Grebenyuk, who visited the United States in January with
several other Soviet miners, said it would be much easier to work
there than in a Donetsk mine.
   ``We saw humane treatment and a real concern for the workers,''
he said after visiting a mine in West Virginia.
   Few statistics are available on accidents and occupational
illnesses in the nation's largest coal field, known as the Donbass.
   Yevgeny Mironov, the acting regional Communist Party leader,
acknowledged the accident rate was ``unfortunately rather high.''
   He blamed ``shortcomings in working conditions'' in the 55 miles
of underground tunnels, and carelessness by miners about safety
rules.
   Miners who stopped to talk blamed their problems on the
Communist Party apparatus.
   Donetsk is better off in some ways than many Soviet cities, even
though sugar is rationed, the stores have no cheese or fresh meat
and fruit is rare in winter. The men sometimes are given meat at
the mine, and milk and yogurt are plentiful.
   Vodka also is plentiful, but there are few clothes, television
sets, refrigerators or cars for sale.
   Most workers live in one-story duplexes, built in the 1940s and
1950s, that need constant repair and have no modern conveniences.
As in much of the Soviet Union, there are not enough new apartment
buildings and the waiting lists for better housing are long.
   Sergei Stolika, 62, continues working 12 years beyond the
retirement age because he can't get by on a monthly pension of 170
rubles.
   Nikolai Tsuprik, 27, earns 550 rubles a month, more than twice
the pay of the average Soviet worker, but asks: ``What can I do
with them? There's nothing to buy in the shops.''
   Vladimir Burdo, 50, said: ``I have two daughters. One of them is
married and has a child. We all live together in a 48-square-meter
flat. You call that life? We need new people in the regional party
committee.'' The size of the apartment is equivalent to 500 square
feet.
   The Communist Party district leader, Nikolai Nikandrov, got only
about 3,000 votes, or 3.4 percent, in the Ukrainian legislative
elections March 4. Two miner candidates got the most votes for the
seat.
   Another loser was Vladimir Ivantsov, party leader at the mine,
who supported the men's demands and appeared to have their respect.
   ``I'm not sorry I lost the elections,'' Ivantsov said. ``People
didn't vote against me, but against the apparatus, the system that
keeps it afloat.''
   Workers want more say in management and greater autonomy for the
mines.
   ``We can't set wholesale prices as we wish,'' Ivantsov said.
``We can't decide ourselves where to sell our production. We can't
buy what we really need, even for production development.''
   Such problems in the mines make the social problems on the
surface all the worse, he said.
   When miners held rallies and demonstrations to force the
regional party leadership out, Ivantsov supported them but stopped
short of endorsing a strike.
   Mironov, the acting regional party leader, said he felt
victimized by the mistakes of those who went before him.
   Voters ``don't want to understand we are quite different'' from
previous party leaders, he said, ``but it is our lot to be called
to account for the mistakes made before us.'' He rejected demands
for his resignation.
   Yuri Makharov of the city strike committee said he was in no
mood for compromise:
   ``They must resign,'' he said, ``not because they are personally
responsible ... but because they are part of the system and we are
out to crush that system.''

   In a state where not so long ago many rural
counties cut the school year to eight months instead of nine, so
the children would have more time to work in the cotton fields,
education has been moved to the front burner. Mississippi is
learning, but the state still has a long way to climb to get out of
last place.

<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Down here at the bottom of America's
statistics the burning issue is no longer race.
   In an evolution as long coming as a magnolia spring, the state
has reckoned that the three r's of the schoolhouse, not the fourth
`r' of racism, are the key to its future. The alternative is
chronic Third Worldism.
   In this climate of introspection, Jim Crow isn't dead. Just
irrelevant.
   The cost of the state's stubborn, sometimes bloody, past, when
race darkened almost any aspect of public policy or private
attitudes, is embarrassingly high. The highest illiteracy rate _ a
third of its adults _ in the nation. The highest school dropout
rate. The lowest score on military entrance tests.
   Thirty percent of Mississippi's high school graduates don't test
high enough to qualify for public college. In 1985-89 less than
half of the college freshmen graduated.
   ``I'm tired of hearing Mississippi this, Mississippi that,''
says Marjorie Vaughan, feisty superintendent of Yazoo County
schools. ``I'm tired of hearing that word `bottom.' We have
problems, but we're all working on them. Both races.''
   Margie Vaughan is right.
   In a state where James Meredith was shot 24 years ago trying to
enroll at Ole Miss, 65 percent of the slim public purse is now
spent on education. Integrated education. The Legislature is
currently scratching its head over how to raise $382 million to
finance a three-year education reform package proposed by Gov. Ray
Mabus, a 41-year-old native back home from Harvard law school and a
Washington legal firm.
   This is a legislature that traditionally ``thinks slow and
thinks small,'' says Ole Miss history professor David Sansing. But
the saliva test for public office in Mississippi today is where you
stand on schooling, not segregation.
   Mabus hoped to pay for a third of his program with a state
lottery, which would have been the first in the South. The Senate
wouldn't play. H.L. Mencken, after all, coined the term Bible Belt
and said the Mississippi state capital at Jackson ``was the
buckle.''
   ``The defeat of the lottery creates a state of uncertainty for
the whole program,'' said a high state official, who would discuss
the issue only if granted anonymity. ``The public is ahead of the
Legislature on this (more than 60 percent favored the lottery in
polls, despite church opposition) but politicians are amazingly
good listeners.''
   The rest of Mabus's BEST program _ Better Education for Success
Tomorrow _would teach adult literacy, go into homes to teach
parents and preschoolers rudimentary techniques of knowledge,
equalize per-pupil expenditures between poor and rich school
districts, free teachers and schools from rote manuals to instruct
in accord with local needs, reward successful schools with bonus
money to spend as they see fit (except for athletics).
   BEST is an all-out drive for school betterment all the more
remarkable for a state that didn't used to have compulsory
education so as to keep whites from having to go to school with
blacks.
   The impetus for reform is simple: economics. To be ignorant in a
computer world is to be eyeless in Gaza.
   ``At every level of planning for our future _ higher employment,
higher standards _ the basic need was always education,'' says Olon
Ray, Mabus' special assistant for education and a former teacher.
``Our chance for improvement in the state _ in the United States _
lies in our human capital.''
   More than a tenth of Americans can't read or write, says the
U.S. census. Lack of a high school educated work force costs the
nation an estimated $225 billion yearly.
   Mabus aims to cut the dropout rate, twice the nation's average,
in half by the year 2001 and reduce illiteracy by 90 percent. A
sobering fact is that three-quarters of Mississippi's projected
work force in 2001 is already beyond school age.
   ``They're all we're going to get, and we need more brains than
brawn,'' says Mike Zitterman, manager for Frito-Lay's Mississippi
operation. As a result, Frito-Lay has donated a semi-truck equipped
with 10 computers to travel the state teaching basic skills to
adults.
   For a change, Mississippi has a first in the nation: a 25
percent tax credit for corporations that teach adult education.
Packard Electric in Clinton is spending $300,000 a year to teach
its workers. There are almost 50 adult literacy programs in the
state, with 40,000 enrollees, says Judy Lipscomb, director of the
Governor's Office for Literacy.
   Mabus is impaled on the horns of a self-made dilemma. He says he
takes ``a dim view'' of raising taxes to pay for his ambitious
BEST. His predecessor, William Winter, bit a similar bullet.
   Among the memorabilila and diplomas on the wall of Winter's
Jackson law office is a painting of a one-room country school. ``I
was the only student from that school ever to graduate from high
school,'' he says. Winter's mother was the teacher. More than
C-A-T, she taught her son a respect for education.
   ``In 1952, one in four whites in Mississippi finished high
school. One in 40 blacks did,'' he says.
   To change this dismal record, Winter ran for governor in 1967 on
an education reform platform. And lost. Ditto in 1975. He ran a
third time in 1979 and won.

   His reform package was finally passed in 1982 _ and paid for
with the largest tax increase in Mississippi history while the
nation was suffering the worst recession since the Depression.
   ``Education had developed a substantial constituency,'' Winter
says.
   Kindergarten was made mandatory. Teacher salaries were raised to
the regional average. Compulsory school attendance was given teeth.
Mrs. Winter's son had changed the terms of political dialogue in
Mississippi.
   ``First Mississippi was a frontier, then before the Civil War a
besieged slave society,'' says Dr. Charles Wilson, a professor of
southern culture at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, also
home of William Faulkner. ``Both societies looked askance at
education.
   ``Nat Turner's rebellion _ he could read _ in 1831 was used as a
horrible example. Teaching slaves became illegal. After the war the
politically powerful wanted to keep taxes low. Why waste money on
inferiors? Landlords didn't want sharecroppers reading the fine
print at the company store. Let 'em grow cotton.''
   The paradox of an ill-educated state producing Faulkners and
Eudora Weltys and Richard Wrights arises from the oral traditions
of both the English yeomen and their African slaves, Wilson
explains. The traditions and histories of both people were handed
down by storytellers. But that is not book learning.
   ``Then in the 1980s there was some kind of transformation in
Mississippi, a consensus that the state was part of the United
States, even the world. Economic growth became agreed on as much as
race used to be. All the debate now is how to fund education, not
if.''
   But expiation for centuries of neglect is daunting. ``Illiteracy
produces a sense of powerlessness,'' says Wilson. ``It feeds a
sense of fatalism. There's a certain security in the status quo
however narrow it may be.''
   A third of Mississippi adults can't help their children with
their homework, read a pill label when they are sick, get their
cars fixed on a credit card so it stays in the garage for weeks.
   Illiteracy means standing in line for government forms, going
home to get them read, then going back to stand in line again. It
means eating potatoes instead of better foods because their prices
are always changing in the supermarket _ all those meaningless
numbers. Toward the end it means no solace from the Bible you can't
read ... Eyeless in Gaza.
   To Dr. Merre Dorman in Starkville, the problem _ and the answer
_ begins almost at birth. In the home. After considerable
arm-wrestling she won grants to begin an outreach program for
children 1 to 7 years old. Children deemed ``at risk'' of
eventually dropping out of school are identified from welfare rolls
and the like. Dorman's paid staff visits the homes weekly to hel
the mothers with nutrition at the stove and nutrition of the mind
of her children. One of Dorman's staff, Emma Mays, is testing two
of the children of Karen Isaacs who is barely in her 20s. Can
Lemarcus, 4, catch a ball? Differentiate textures? Later Mrs. Mays
will get basic textbooks to teach Karen and Lemarcus habits of
basic intelligence.
   Lemarcus, a bright-looking child, doesn't know he's at risk.
Merre Dorman did and did something about it. ``Just talking to PTAs
is like preaching to the choir,'' she says.
   There are countless numbers of such local experiments under way
in Mississippi, some financed by foundations, some with computers
donated by private corporations.
   Judy Lipscomb overheard two janitors talking at the University
of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg about the computer software
program they were using in their adult literacy course. (Two
hundred and seventy employees at the school have been identified as
illiterate.)
   ``How many janitors do you hear talking about software?
Gradually we are taking the stigma out of illiteracy.''
   It takes four years on average to teach an adult to read and
write, same as for a child.
   Since Winter's 1982 reform, test scores of Mississippi's 500,000
schoolchildren have risen noticeably, if slightly. (An additional
50,000 remain in the private academies that sprouted when
integration became mandatory in 1971.)
   There are any number of educators in place like Margie Vaughan.
``You can't teach with leaking roofs and trash cans in the halls
that need dumping. I'm on probation because my teacher-pupil ratio
is too high. I could fix it tomorrow if I had money. That's all it
takes. Money.
   ``I tell my teachers, `Don't talk to me about a child's
background. That child is coming to you with nothing. Give him
something!'''
   Behind Margie Vaughan's desk is a stitched sampler: ``If you can
read this, thank a teacher.'' One of her kids did once, named a
horse for her. She laughs. ``We shall overcome.''
   Coming from a white superintendent, that rallying call of the
South's blacks did not seem out of place in the context of
Mississippi's school reform. Education has always been the silver
bullet that could kill bigotry.

   Margaret Walker Alexander at 74 is a
living time capsule of the agony of black education in Mississippi.
   Her great-grandfather was a literate freed blacksmith in Georgia
who fell in love with a slave while shoeing horses on a plantation.
One of their children became a Baptist minister and helped found a
Negro college in an abandoned hospital in Natchez that became
Jackson State.
   As a child she knew the insides of one of the 4,000 little white
schoolhouses built for blacks in the South by the philanthropy of
Sears and Roebuck millionaire Julius Rosenwald.
   Mrs. Alexander got two degrees from Northwestern, came back to
Jackson State to teach and has written poetry, a novel and a
biography of black novelist Richard Wright, author of ``Native
Son.'' She lives on a street in Jackson that is named for her.
   ``I've seen three revolutions in my time: the New Deal, civil
rights and the electronic age,'' she says. ``My grandparents said
education was the most important. My grandchildren say education is
not enough. There has to be economic accessibility.''

   George Esper, who wrote the following story,
spent 10 years covering the Vietnam War for The Associated Press
and was there when South Vietnam fell to the communist North on
April 30, 1975. He has returned to Vietnam twice, in 1984 and 1989.

   On the killing fields of Vietnam, residue of the 10-year war has
been mostly bulldozed away, except for an occasional spent shell or
a rusted mess kit stuck in the red dirt.
   But back home in America, a spate of new books and films has
kept memories of the divisive war very much alive.
   Like the men they portray, books about the Vietnam War, fiction
or non-fiction, had a tough time being accepted after Saigon fell
to the communists. Now 15 years later they pour from the presses by
the hundreds.
   Through them a new generation relives the horrors of the battles
at places like the Rock Pile, Dak To, Hamburger Hill, Khe Sanh and
Nui Lon Mountain.
   It was on April 30, 1975, that South Vietnam fell, ending a war
in which nearly 3 million Americans fought and 58,000 died.
   In the late 1970s, an older generation of award-winning books
about Vietnam came along. They included Michael Herr's
``Dispatches,'' Tim O'Brien's ``Going After Cacciato,'' Robert
Stone's ``Dog Soldiers'' and Philip Caputo's ``A Rumor of War,''
which like some others was initially rejected before being
published in 1977.
   But it wasn't until the 1980s that Vietnam became a popular
subject for books and movies. The dedication of the Vietnam
Memorial in Washington brought a new respectability to veterans,
and a new look at the war.
   Tom Hebert, a veteran who runs the mail-order Vietnam Bookstore
from his home in Burlington, Conn., estimates more than 500 books
about the Vietnam War have been published since 1982. His best
sellers from the '80s include John DelVecchio's ``The 13th
Valley,'' Robert Mason's ``Chickenhawk'' and Neil Sheehan's ``A
Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam.''
   The passing of time also has brought a breakthrough in movies.
   After 10 years of trying, a twice-wounded Vietnam veteran,
Oliver Stone, brought to the screen ``Platoon,'' the 1987 Academy
Award-winning movie that is a semi-autobiographical account of his
tour.
   ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' based on paraplegic Ron Kovic's
1976 autobiography of patriotism, anger, guilt and disillusionment
in the aftermath of war, was nominated for eight Academy Awards
this year.
   ``The experience of war is still inherently so mysterious and
fascinating that we just can't seem to examine enough of it,'' says
Michael Norman, a radioman who wrote ``These Good Men,'' one of a
recent outpouring of powerful personal accounts of the savagery of
the war and a search for its meaning.
   ``For the men who fought who want to turn war into art, you got
to let some time pass,'' says Norman. ``Wordsworth was right. Art
is emotion recollected in tranquillity. You can't be tranquil about
the war until you let a decent amount of time pass and you think
about it.''
   Norman traced the lives of 11 comrades with whom he had survived
the ``brutal, obscene'' war in an odyssey that took him 50,000
miles in search of what it all meant and what they had become.
   The realization came to him 16 years later that these men acted
at their very best even though he feels sending them to Vietnam in
the cause of democracy turned out to be a lie.
   ``There is no sense to Vietnam when one is sober,'' Rod Kane
writes in ``Veterans's Day,'' another recent book. His service as a
medic was like being on a car that was out of control, he says.
After a while, Vietnam was out of control. Watching his friends die
turned Kane into a drunk until he sobered up eight years ago.
   The new books are filled with metaphors of the senselessness of
the war, of American blood spilled in assaults against meaningless
hills and mountaintops of no strategic value.
   News correspondents who were there recall hills like 875 and
1338 that towered thousands of feet above the Dak To Valley and
claimed 1,300 American soldiers. Scores of wounded had lain on the
hillside for more than two days in great pain before a relief
column broke through to rescue them.
   ``I have always preached a lot about hell but I had never seen
it until the last three days,'' the brigade chaplain was moved to
say.
   Many of the American paratroopers at Hamburger Hill had a
premonition they were going to die but they were unable to do
anything about it. For eight days, the paratroopers assaulted the
hill at the cost of 46 men killed and 300 wounded.

<HEAD>UNDATED: 300 wounded.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   At Khe Sanh, the North Vietnamese artillery bombardments reached
more than 1,000 rounds on some days. American Marines were at their
very best under the worst conditions, dragging bleeding comrades
toward bunkers, pleading, ``Corpsman! Corpsman! We've got wounded
here,'' withstanding a 77-day siege that inflicted nearly 2,000
casualties, one-third of the entire garrison. In the end, they
abandoned it.
   Jacque Navarra Rhoads, who co-edited the book, ``Nurses in
Vietnam: The Forgotten Veterans,'' at age 22 had come straight from
nursing school in Albion, N.Y., to tend to the shattered bodies in
the monsoons and mud.
   ``It's really depressing because of the amputations,'' she would
say. ``What a waste of men. If I knew what we were fighting for, if
the enemy did something to our country, I could see it. I don't
know why we're here. So many GIs ask why. I can't answer. I came
because they needed medical help. I wanted to appreciate things
better back home, like clean sheets, running water and a happy
family.''
   Another nurse, Edith Knox, was so repelled by the sight of four
casualties with amputated legs the first time she made her rounds
that she had to leave the emergency room. ``I had never seen
anything quite like that,'' she would say.
   But the most difficult part of her tour was when a youngster
would ask her, ``How do I write and tell my wife I don't have a leg
anymore?''
   Nurse Sharon Lane's medical battalion treated 10,000 patients in
nine months. She was so proud of that milestone that she wrote home
about it. Four days later, a piece of steel from a North Vietnamese
rocket tore through her aorta. She bled to death less than a month
before her 26th birthday, the first of eight women killed by
hostile fire in Vietnam.
   Like many veterans, Rod Kane felt lonely and out of place. A war
that no one wanted turned him into an outcast, a man who felt he
had nothing to offer and was unworthy of returning to society.
   Some veterans were proud to serve in Vietnam, at least early on.
Disillusionment set in during the late 1960s and early 1970s.
   In 1961, Tom Davis wrote his father: ``I just hope that our
little bit will help to ease things in this part of the world. I
don't feel too badly about having to be here when I think of all
the potential good it will have for this country.''
   Three days before his first Christmas away from his wife and
13-month-old daughter in Tennessee, a Viet Cong bullet ripped
through his head. He was the first American to die in combat in
Vietnam.
   But as the decade of the '60s neared an end, no one wanted to be
the last to die in Vietnam, certainly not the men of ``A'' Company
of the 196th Light Infantry Brigade's 3rd Battalion. For five days
in August 1969, ``A'' Company had tried to push the North
Vietnamese off Nui Lon Mountain, only to be driven back. Finally
the men balked.
   ``I am sorry, sir, but my men refused to go _ we cannot move
out,'' the company commander radioed headquarters.
   ``Repeat that please. Have you told them what it means to
disobey orders under fire?'' asked the battalion commander.
   ``I think they understood,'' the company commander replied.
``But some of them simply had enough _ they are broken. There are
boys here who have only 90 days left in Vietnam. They want to go
home in once piece ....''
   Harry G. Summers Jr., editor of Vietnam Magazine, author of the
book ``On Strategy,'' and twice decorated for valor, says there is
a very strong statement of patriotism in most of the literature he
has seen. ``Not happy about the way it all ended, but certainly
proud that they'd served their country and I think that represents
the true feeling of most Vietnam vets.''
   Michael Norman says war puts a lie to the notion that men fight
for a flag and they fight for their country. ``They fight to stand
by the man on their right or left, the people that they're close to
at the moment. And they fight to survive.''
   Sharon Lane was posthumously awarded a galaxy of medals and a
memorial statue of her stands in the courtyard of Aultman Hospital
in Canton, Ohio, where she went to nursing school.
   Her mother, Kay Lane, recalls that ``she just thought she was a
nobody, you know, just an ordinary person, and everybody tries to
make a hero out of her now.''

   John Silber's 95-year-old mother once told him,
``Son, your tongue will be your ruin.'' As he seeks the Democratic
nomination for governor of Massachusetts, the outspoken president
of Boston University has begun to heed those words. Still, this
transplanted Texan is not one to shy away from a fight.

   John Silber's most distinctive feature is not his
deformed right arm, a stump he learned to use as a weapon in
schoolyard scraps.
   What is most physically striking are the furrows that crease his
face, especially when he argues. And those furrows are likely to
deepen in the coming weeks as this Kant scholar who whipped Boston
University into shape goes after the Democratic nomination for
governor of Massachusetts.
   The 63-year-old philosopher-turned-politician, a wiry man who
stands just 5-feet-7, will take on anyone in an argument.
   ``I love it. I love it. It's a sport,'' he says, seated in his
spartan campaign office furnished with rented green leather
couches, his blue eyes framed by a full head of brown hair. ``It's
a participation sport. Some people like fencing, and I like
arguing. Obviously I like arguing.''
   A transplanted Texan now serving as president of Boston
University, Silber is the squeaky wheel in a four-way race for the
job a politically weary Gov. Michael Dukakis no longer wants.
   His competitors at the Democratic Party convention June 1-2 are
the lieutenant governor, a former state attorney general and a
state lawmaker.
   In his native Texas they would call John Silber a maverick.
Argumentative as a child, combative as a scholar and daring as a
university administrator, he is kicking up a dust-storm of
controversy.
   First he complained about the state's welfare largess and
Cambodian immigrants in a way some people thought smacked of
racism. Then he shared his views on alcoholism in a way critics
said trivialized the problem. And he raised hackles when he called
Jews racist during an interview in which he recalled his attraction
to Judaism as a 21-year-old divinity student at Yale.
   Silber says he considered converting but decided not to when he
discovered ``the racism of Jews is quite phenomenal'' in treating
converts as ``second-class.'' It was more than 10 years later,
after his father died, that Silber learned his father was Jewish.
   Silber fought back against the critics. He said he was
misquoted, misunderstood and a victim of media distortion. He
pointed out his unwavering support for minorities and Israel.
   But if some in reserved New England call Silber a provocative
outsider, that's the way he likes it.
   He thinks voters like it, too, and that the confrontational
style he was weaned on in Texas works here as well.
   ``It also gets the point across in Massachusetts,'' he says.
``It may not be the style that some reporters like. It may not be
the style that some people in universities like. But it's a style
that the taxpayers like a very great deal.''
   Still, Silber is learning to turn down the fire on the hustings.
After the first explosive weeks, he began minding what he said. He
seems to have heeded his 95-year-old mother, who he says told him:
``Son, your tongue will be your ruin.''
   A wittier, circumspect John Silber demonstrated what he's
learned on the campaign trail at a breakfast early in March with
150 members of the Lexington Chamber of Commerce.
   Since coming to Massachusetts 19 years ago, he began, ``I tried
to tell the truth and shame the devil. Now I've heard I have to
charm a few people at the same time.''
   He cracked a joke about the once-touted Massachusetts economic
miracle. ``A miracle is a phenomenon for which there is no rational
explanation. We had a Massachusetts mirage.''
   The audience loved it.
   Many said they came out of curiosity to hear the one interesting
candidate around. But they were enchanted after he said how he
wanted to overhaul the state budget process to tighten spending and
efficiency, how he wanted to weed out waste in state operations and
``put an end to amateur hour'' running state agencies, how he was
committed to improving education and stimulating the state economy
with tax incentives.

   The son of a German architect and a Texas schoolteacher, Silber
is fond of saying he has been a Democrat since age 10. He also
voted for Republican Presidents Reagan and Bush. He labels himself
both a populist and an elitist. And for a political novice, he has
shown a politician's flair in making over Boston University and
taking his message of education reform on the road.
   ``I could be speaking every night in this state, and that was
before I announced for governor,'' he says.
   If you haven't heard him speak, you can read: ``Straight
Shooting: What's Wrong With America and How to Fix It,'' published
last year by Harper &amp; Row.
   Silber was educated at Trinity University in his hometown, San
Antonio, and at Yale. He has six daughters and a son. He was 44
when he took over Boston University 19 years ago. He had just been
fired as dean of arts and sciences at the University of Texas at
Austin, following years of discord between him and the Board of
Regents over changes made in his department and his criticism of
university policies.
   As the president of Boston University, he transformed an
academically uneven, debt-burdened school into a solid institution
with 26,000 students, an endowment of $183 million and a budget
nearing $500 million.
   The early years of his term at the university were rough. Silber
fought with faculty over politics, labor organizing and tenure. He
survived attempted faculty coups and revolts. Students and civil
libertarians protested when he ordered the removal of
anti-apartheid banners from dormitory windows and he limited
overnight dorm visits by members of the opposite sex.
   Silber wants to govern the state because, he says, he knows a
better way and because he thinks public service is an obligation.
If it gets any deeper than that, he won't say.
   ``I think people who can serve and who can afford to take the
financial sacrifice necessary to serve, every now and then, ought
to do so.''
   As president of Boston University, Silber gets $275,000 a year
and a house. The governor earns $75,000 and that's it.
Massachusetts provides no governor's mansion.
   ``A lot of people wouldn't give up $200,000,'' Silber says. ``I
don't give a fig for money in that sense. Money never gave anybody
a meaningful life.''
   William Goetzmann, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian at the
University of Texas headed the department when Silber was running
things there in 1969-70. Goetzmann is no Silber chum, but he
respects him.
   ``I would regard him as a tough person, and yet underneath the
sort of tough initial appearance or manner he can also be reasoned
with,'' Goetzmann says.
   Goetzman says Silber reminds him of Michael Dukakis with that
``sort of steely eyed determination.''
   ``He puts all his guns on the bar,'' Goetzman says. ``He is a
doer.''
   Silber has the support of Senate President William Bulger, one
of the most powerful people at the statehouse, and former Boston
Mayor Kevin White, now a Boston University faculty member.
   But some political observers don't believe he can win.
   ``It doesn't look good,'' says Paul Watanabe, a political
scientist at the University of Massachusetts in Boston.
   Silber needs at least 15 percent of the approximately 5,000
state convention delegates to get on the Sept. 18 primary ballot.
   Ralph Whitehead, a political observer who teaches journalism at
the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, is more optimistic.
   Even in the clubby world of Democratic Party politics, Silber
should be able to acquire the requisite delegates to make the
primary, Whitehead says. And with the campaign expected to be a
string of debates, Silber can be expected to shine.
   ``There's no question that the Democratic state convention is
highly unlikely to encourage a Silber candidacy,'' Whitehead says.
``Nevertheless, it might still accept a Silber candidacy.
   ``I don't count John Silber out.''

   After 15 years, director Francis Ford Coppola
and actor Al Pacino are back together again to make a third
``Godfather'' movie, a super-secret production being filmed in
Rome, Sicily and New York at a cost of $44 million. It is expected
to be released around Thanksgiving.

   When it comes to making ``The Godfather, Part III,''
omerta is the word.
   Silence. The Mafia's code of silence.
   ``I just know to keep my mouth shut and my script in the safe,''
says Franc D'Ambrosio, who plays Tony Corleone, son of Cosa Nostra
chieftain Michael Corleone.
   When we last saw Michael in ``Godfather, Part II,'' he was
having his older brother, Fredo, shot through the head on a fishing
boat on Lake Tahoe.
   Now, 15 years later, director Francis Ford Coppola and most of
the cast are back together to make the third chapter of one of the
most successful movie sagas of all time.
   The $44 million production, set in 1979, is being shot in Rome,
Sicily and New York and is targeted for release in the United
States around Thanksgiving.
   The basic storyline has leaked out: Michael, played again by Al
Pacino, seeks to legitimize the Corleone family by teaming up with
a Vatican archbishop who helps him acquire a stake in a European
multinational corporation.
   But the script and the stars, especially Pacino, Diane Keaton
and Andy Garcia, are being kept tightly under wraps. The final 12
pages of the script are so secret they were reportedly printed on
special paper that can't be photocopied.
   D'Ambrosio says Pacino, who is made up to look 60 years old, and
Keaton, who plays the don's estranged wife, Kay, are so adamant
about not being photographed that extras are checked to make sure
they're not sneaking cameras onto the set.
   ``The production assistants are always aware of a flash
anywhere,'' says D'Ambrosio, turning to a nervous Coppola aide for
instructions on what he can and can't say.
   Coppola at age 50 has more than his artistic reputation on the
line. His financial survival is at stake. A string of box-office
flops such as ``One From the Heart,'' ``Rumble Fish'' and ``The
Outsiders'' have left him and his Zoetrope studios in economic
shambles.
   In late January, Coppola and Zoetrope Productions filed for
bankruptcy protection from creditors, listing assets of $22.2
million and debts of $28.9 million. The move followed protracted
litigation over debts owed to Jack Singer, a Canadian real estate
developer who lent Coppola $3 million to help him complete ``One
From the Heart.''
   Coppola hopes to duplicate the success of the first two
``Godfather'' movies, which won the Academy Award for best picture
in 1972 and 1974 and together have grossed some $800 million
worldwide. Coppola was voted best director, producer and writer for
``Godfather II,'' widely hailed as one of the best film sequels
ever made.
   With Marlon Brando portraying aging boss Vito Corleone, the
first ``Godfather'' described the ascendancy of the
Italian-American Corleone crime family in New York and Las Vegas.
Son Michael murders his father's archenemy in a New York
restaurant, hides out in Sicily for more than a year, and returns
to the United States to assume power as the new godfather.
   Part II jumps back and forth between the early years of Vito
Corleone, played by Robert De Niro, and the late 1950s when Michael
consolidates his power. The film culminates with Michael, feeling
betrayed, having his brother murdered.
   Despite the obvious potential of a third ``Godfather''
installment, Coppola had vowed not to get involved again with the
Corleone family.
   ``If I had to do it, I would just take the story and tell it
again, which is what they do on these sequels,'' the director, who
declined to be interviewed for this article, is quoted as saying in
the recently released book ``Coppola'' by Peter Cowie. ``I'm not
really interested in gangsters anymore.''
   It took Paramount Pictures 15 years to get the cameras rolling
on ``Godfather III.'' Untold numbers of directors, producers,
writers and screenplays were considered and rejected. Among the
Hollywood heavyweights reportedly interested in the project were
Sylvester Stallone and Eddie Murphy.
   Last year Coppola finally agreed to join forces again with Mario
Puzo, whose best-selling novel gave rise to the ``Godfather''
movies, to develop the story for part III.
   According to the Hollywood trade publication Variety, Coppola's
decision probably stemmed in large part from the financial
incentives. Paramount made him _ what else? _ an offer he couldn't
refuse: some $6 million, plus a share of the gross. (His signing
fee for the first Godfather was $125,000.)
   To perfect the script, Coppola invited actors and crew to his
1,500-acre estate in the Napa Valley near San Francisco.
   Coppola has reassembled many of the cast and crew of the earlier
``Godfather'' pictures. For three months, they've been
headquartered at Rome's Cinecitta studios, a 148-acre complex where
most of the interior scenes are being filmed.
   Behind the camera again are producers Fred Roos and Gray
Frederickson, production designer Dean Tavoularis, photography
director Gordon Willis and music composer Carmine Coppola, the
director's father.
   On screen, besides Pacino and Keaton, Coppola's sister, Talia
Shire, is back as Connie Corleone and Al Martino returns as Johnny
Fontane, the crooner in the first ``Godfather.''
   But there are also new faces and a new generation of Corleones.
   The key figure is Garcia, who plays Vincent Mancini, Michael's
illegitimate nephew, born of the tryst between Sonny Corleone and a
bridesmaid during the wedding party in the first film. Vincent is
Michael's apparent heir. Coppola's daughter, Sofia, has the role of
Mary Corleone, Michael's daughter.
   Other newcomers are Bridget Fonda as journalist Grace Madison,
Joe Mantegna as gangster Joey Zasa, George Hamilton as arbitrageur
B.J. Harrison and Eli Wallach as Don Altobello.
   Donal Donnelly plays Irish Archbishop Terence Kilday, a Vatican
bank official who acts as the intermediary in the Corleone family's
new business ventures. The story stems from the real-life scandal
involving the Vatican bank's alleged role in the 1982 collapse of
Banco Ambrosiano, Italy's largest private bank.
   D'Ambrosio, a 27-year-old tenor from New York, was a surprise
choice for the role of Tony Corleone. He was appearing in
Broadway's ``Sweeney Todd'' when he was signed up, beating out more
than 1,000 others who auditioned for the part. It is his first
movie.
   ``I call it the Godfather University,'' D'Ambrosio says. ``It's
a crash course. I'm learning from the best.''

   In the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York,
the village of Saranac Lake was known as ``The City of the Sick,''
a place where tuberculosis sufferers came to take the cure. Modern
antibiotics put an end to that, and the town almost died.

<DATELINE>SARANAC LAKE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saranac Lake once was a typical
one-industry town _ with a difference.
   Its business was illness.
   For nearly 70 years, Saranac Lake was synonymous with both a
feared disease, tuberculosis, and the sanitarium ``cure,'' medical
science's best guess as to how to treat what was once mankind's
greatest killer.
   The TB sufferers have been gone for a generation, but Saranac
Lake endures, still proud to be known as the ``City of the Sick.''
   Salvation to TB sufferers came in the early 1950s with the
development of an effective antibiotic treatment for the disease.
But that also dealt an economic blow to this remote Adirondack
Mountain village about 270 miles north of New York City.
   ``It was a disaster for the community,'' says Barbara Parnass of
Historic Saranac Lake, a preservation group. ``It wasn't the kind
of thing that was dramatic like a fire. But the slow ebbing of the
curing industry affected the community very severely.''
   In its curing heyday, spitting on Saranac Lake's sidewalks could
get you a summons from the police, because the dreaded TB infection
was contained in the sputum of a tubercular. It was a place where
radios went dead each afternoon, when TB patients were supposed to
be resting silently in the open air of their cure porches.
   ``In some ways, the village had been run by the doctors and the
lawyers and the bankers,'' Parnass says. ``They sat on the board of
health. They made the rules and regulations. There was a very
precise booklet printed up telling everyone how to behave. When the
curing collapsed, the doctors retired or they found other places to
practice. That left an awful lot of the service industry here with
nobody to service.''
   Only in recent years has Saranac Lake finally showed signs of
snapping out of it. The Tudor-style Will Rogers Hospital, which
once cared for show business tuberculars, has just been converted
to condominiums.
   The Trudeau Sanitarium is now a conference center owned by the
American Management Association. The nearby Ray Brook Sanitarium is
a state prison.
   And many of the 300 cure cottages, the residential
mini-hospitals that made Saranac Lake unique among TB centers, are
being restored by private homeowners to their turn-of-the-century
grandeur.
   Parnass says the sudden collapse of the TB industry helped from
the viewpoint of historical preservation in Saranac Lake.
   ``When the plug was pulled, the economic bottom dropped out of
the whole village,'' she says. ``The railroad stopped running.
There was no money to tear down and put up new houses. In some ways
it was good because it held the housing stock where it was.''
   Nine out of 10 structures in Saranac Lake, which has about 5,500
residents today, were built before World War II. Parnass' group
recently applied to have 187 buildings in the village, including 63
cure cottages, added to the National Register of Historic Places.
   The village is remembering its legacy in other ways, too.
   A sign proclaiming Saranac Lake as America's ``Pioneer Health
Resort'' still greets visitors. In September, Parnass' group will
sponsor the second reunion in Saranac Lake of cure patients, their
relatives, doctors, nurses and others involved in the TB industry.
   About 200 people attended the first reunion in 1987.
   They are among the dwindling circle of people who remember
firsthand the misery and terror generated by tuberculosis.
   The disease was the ``White Plague,'' the killer that stalked
slums and fashionable drawing rooms with equal impunity. Keats,
Thoreau and Kafka were just a few of the leading lights of their
ages to die from the disease, popularly called ``consumption''
because of the way TB appears to consume the tattered tissue of the
lungs of victims stricken with its most common form, pulmonary
tuberculosis.
   What made tuberculosis seem even more terrible was that, for a
long time, no one was sure what caused it. Even when a German
physician, Dr. Robert Koch, identified the bacterium responsible
for TB in 1882, it took researchers another 70 years to find the
right antibiotics to effectively attack the infection.
   Dr. Lee Reichman, speaking for the American Lung Association,
compared the fear surrounding TB when it was at its height in the
late 19th century and early 20th century as similar to the fear now
created by acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   In their quest to find some effective treatment for the disease,
American doctors began to recommend that tuberculars live in dry
climates or in elevated places like the mountains of the American
Southwest, the Rockies or the Adirondacks of New York state. It was
thought that such an atmosphere would dry out the clogged lungs of
TB patients and retard the spread of their infections.
   Dr. Edward Livingston Trudeau, a tubercular who believed that
being in the Adirondacks saved his life, was credited with
popularizing the region as a health resort.
   In 1884, Trudeau established the first U.S. sanitarium for the
treatment of TB patients in Saranac Lake. Modeled on German
sanitariums of the same era, Trudeau used the tiny, two-patient
cottage, later nicknamed ``Little Red,'' to develop a model for
treatment that was eventually adopted by most American sanitariums.
   The main activity at a ``san'' was inactivity.
   Patients were exposed to fresh air, during the harshest days of
winter as well as in sweltering summer heat, by sitting quietly for
hours at a time on specially designed lounging chairs. Patients
deemed too ill to sit or stand were wheeled onto the porches in
their beds. The body temperature and weight of patients was
monitored carefully and a great emphasis was placed on proper diet.
   Saranac Lake took pains to be a happy place, to make tuberculars
welcome and to ease their burden. There were picnics, sleigh rides,
hay rides and bedside instruction on activities from bookbinding
and bird-watching.
   A winter carnival that began in 1897 as a diversion for TB
patients is now billed by village fathers as the oldest of its kind
in the United States.

   From the Shenandoah Valley of West Virginia
``The Martinsburg Monster'' is keeping an eye on American
taxpayers. The ``monster'' is a huge central computer center where
the Internal Revenue Service keeps track of its $1 trillion-a-year
collections.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By RAY FORMANEK Jr.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MARTINSBURG, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The heart of the Internal Revenue
Service doesn't beat. It whirls, beeps and blinks at dizzying
speeds on dozens of computers and about 330,000 spools of computer
tape guarded like a fortress.
   It has your number.
   ``This is the one place where it all comes together and where it
all goes back out,'' says Gerald Rabe, director of the Martinsburg
Computing Center, dubbed ``The Martinsburg Monster.''
   ``I would say the computer system we use here is probably second
to none in the amount of data processed.''
   Row upon row of blue-and-tan computers hum inside a single-story
brick building about 80 miles northwest of Washington, sending and
retrieving bits of information from the tax returns of more than
140 million individual taxpayers and about 50 million businesses.
   The magnetic tapes in the master file could circle the Earth at
the equator 5{ times, IRS spokesman Charles Koeneke says.
   Income, interest, deductions and other tabulations from every
tax return filed in the United States are stored at the center for
an average of five years.
   Paper returns are sent to federal records centers around the
country where they are stored in boxes for an average of seven
years before they are burned.
   ``It depends on what type of taxpayer the individual is,'' Rabe
says. ``If you have a criminal case or there is some other problem,
those records are kept longer than those of a so-called `good'
taxpayer.''
   Information gleaned from President Bush's recent tax returns is
stored here, among tidbits gleaned from Ronald Reagan's, Donald
Trump's and those with more mundane tax histories.
   ``All taxpayers are created equal in our eyes,'' Rabe says.
   The computer tapes which make up the IRS master file are locked
away in the center's room-size vault kept between 68 and 72 degrees
and at 35 percent relative humidity. The vault uses heat generated
by the center's dozens of mainframe computers and body heat to keep
the nearly constant conditions.
   The $1 trillion in federal taxes paid in fiscal 1988 paid for
the IRS center, and most of the rest of the federal government,
according to Frank Keith, an IRS spokesman in Washington.
   The master file is restricted to a limited number of employees
and 10 IRS service centers in Atlanta; Philadelphia; Kansas City,
Mo.; Andover, Mass.; Austin, Texas; Holtsville, N.Y.; Covington,
Ky.; Fresno, Calif.; Memphis, Tenn.; and Ogden, Utah.
   The regional centers use the master file to verify returns and
to determine whether a tax refund or payment is due.
   It takes 700 computer programmers, analysts, operators and
others working three shifts every day to keep the center operating
all year.
   ``Everyone thinks we're coming up to the busiest time of year
for the IRS. That's not true,'' Rabe says. ``We have a work
schedule that keeps us busy 52 weeks a year. The business side goes
on year-round with the filing of quarterly reports and other
programs.''
   The people's tax returns are guarded in an accountant's Fort
Knox.
   The low-slung, buff-colored building is surrounded by a
10-foot-high chain-link fence topped with strands of glistening
barbed wire. Armed IRS guards patrol the grounds set among apple
and peach orchards in the Shenandoah Valley.
   Three hidden diesel generators stand ready to deliver emergency
electricity to the center's computers and air conditioning system
in the event of a blackout.
   Teams of programmers and technicians are on-call 24 hours a day
at the center to purge glitches and to keep data from disappearing.
   Koeneke refused to divulge other backups for the heart of the
IRS system that reaches into the pockets of millions of taxpayers
each April 15.
   ``We're probably the best kept secret in town,'' he says.
   When the center opened in 1961 with five employees, there was
little inkling of the explosive growth to come. It had a single IBM
computer with less storage capacity than most of today's home
computers and 1,700 magnetic tapes to handle an estimated 78
million tax returns.
   The original 39,000-square-foot center cost $5.3 million in
1961. At the time, many believed it was built in Martinsburg
because of West Virginia's critical support of John F. Kennedy over
Hubert Humphrey in the state's 1960 Democratic primary for the
presidential nomination.
   Since then, the center has more than tripled in size. It is one
of the largest employers in West Virginia's Eastern Panhandle.
   Before the center opened, tax returns were processed by
thousands of clerks who relied on boxes and boxes of records kept
around the country.
   The IRS is now testing a system that accepts electronic tax
returns prepared by computer and the storage of data on electronic
disks instead of magnetic tape.
   ``We're just getting into telecommunications,'' says Rabe, who
started his IRS career as a computer programmer trainee in 1964.
   Critics, including members of Congress and the General
Accounting Office, have said the IRS needs to replace its aging
computer system, a move that could cost as much $11 billion,
according to Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., chairman of the Senate
finance oversight subcommittee. The GAO puts the cost between $3
billion and $4 billion.
   Planned improvements will put laptop computers into the hands of
revenue agents and tax collectors.
   An expanded master file operating as a data base available to a
number of computer facilities also is in the works, IRS officials
say.
   ``We want to get to the point where banks and gas and electric
companies are right now,'' said Rabe. ``If you call us with a
question, we want to be able to call up your entire account on the
computer screen and answer your questions immediately instead of
waiting there to get a response from a service center.''

   The word is that ``Elvis'' is not dead, just
waiting to make a comeback.
   The ABC Sunday night television series, which stars Michael St.
Gerard as rock 'n' roll singer Elvis Presley, was taken off the air
in mid-March after a poor performance in the ratings race.
   The critically acclaimed show continues in production, however,
as the network looks for a new time period. ABC officials say it
could return as early as May.
   ABC had high hopes for ``Elvis,'' which followed ``America's
Funniest Home Videos'' on Sunday. But several things happened to
derail those hopes. The video show became such a runaway hit that
the ratings for ``Elvis,'' by comparison, looked dismal. Even a
preview behind top-rated ``Roseanne'' didn't help.
   Next, Fox Broadcasting scheduled the animated show ``The
Simpsons'' against it, and that show creamed ``Elvis.'' Most young
viewers watch ABC's ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' then switch
to Fox for ``The Simpsons.'' The rest of the country watches CBS's
``Murder, She Wrote'' or the NBC movie. In the ratings, ``Elvis'
came in only slightly ahead of the Fox also-rans.
   The decision to pull ``Elvis'' came after ``America's Funniest
Home Videos'' finished first in the Nielsen ratings for the week
ending March 11, while ``Elvis'' was 45th. ABC felt it had to act
because of the enormous drop in viewership.
   In the overall ratings for the 1989-90 season, ``Elvis'' was in
56th place, halfway through the Nielsen ratings of the 112 shows in
prime time _ including those that have been replaced.
   On the plus side, ``Elvis'' did better than anything else ABC
has tried in that Sunday time slot in a long time.
   Young viewers who control the sets early Sunday night apparently
aren't aware of Presley. If they remember him at all, it's from his
later, bloated, Las Vegas years. Even St. Gerard, who's 27,
concedes he wasn't an Elvis fan.
   St. Gerard, in an interview before the ABC decision, said that
he doesn't pay much attention to the ratings and that ABC
executives told him they would stick with the show.
   ``I do my best and after that it's not in my hands,'' he says.
``I figure anybody cool is going to watch us. It's a quality show.
The critical reaction has been overwhelming. We set out to do
something respectful of an American legend. I never took this as a
joke.''
   The show is filmed on authentic locations in Memphis, Tenn., and
St. Gerard strives for an interpretation rather than an imitation.
He looks remarkably like Presley even without the benefit of makeup
and he possesses the singer's early charm and shyness.
   He lip-syncs to lyrics sung by Ronnie McDowell because the
scenes require more flexibility than is found in original Presley
recordings.
   St. Gerard was in Los Angeles for a few days after he began
filming ``Elvis'' late last year. He lives in New York, where he
played a small role in an ABC Afterschool Special, ``The Accident.''
   Regardless of the outcome of ``Elvis,'' St. Gerard seems assured
of a booming career. He previously starred in the movie
``Hairspray,'' and now he's reading nine scripts to see what his
next picture will be. First, he was returning to Memphis to film
four more episodes of ``Elvis.''
   ``I'm anxious to get back,'' he says. ``I love the South. I miss
it. I miss my friends there. I miss Elvis, too. It's funny. I miss
playing the part.
   ``Elvis was a very complex person. He was naive in some ways,
but in other ways he was very focused and determined. He knew how
to get his point across. He had a way of handling himself. On
stage, he was the king.''
   St. Gerard says filming ``Elvis'' in Memphis has been like a
homecoming in some respects. Priscilla Presley, Elvis' former wife,
is one of the executive producers. Many of Presley's old friends
have shown up to help.
   He plays Presley between ages 19 and 21, when times were still
tough and the singer was just beginning to attract attention with
his music. Billy Green Bush plays his father and Millie Perkins
(``The Diary of Anne Frank'') plays his mother.
   ``I hope we can take the show up to the time when his mother
dies,'' St. Gerard says. ``That was the end of an era. She died in
1958 when he was in the Army. After that, his motivation changed.
In the beginning his motivation was to pull his family out of its
lower economic strata. He had a lot of drive.''
   Elvis Presley has been portrayed on the screen before. Kurt
Russell played him in the 1977 ABC movie ``Elvis,'' which beat
``Gone With the Wind'' in the ratings. Don Johnson was Presley in
the 1981 NBC movie ``Elvis and the Beauty Queen.'' Dale Midkiff was
Presley in the 1988 TV movie ``Elvis and Me,'' based on Priscilla
Presley's book. McDowell sang for all the movies.

   Since Stephen Lang landed his latest role as a
Marine officer in ``A Few Good Men'' on Broadway, he has been
obsessively shining his boots.
   In the play at the Music Box Theater, Lang is Lt. Col. Nathan
Jessup, a base commander so gung-ho he's demented.
   ``When I'm shining my boots, it makes me feel more like a
Marine,'' Lang says. ``I've been working on my left boot for
months. It will not take a shine. It's recalcitrant.''
   Lang arrives at the theater two or three hours before the
curtain goes up. ``I'm chronically early,'' he says. ``The deeper I
get into a run, the more necessary it is for me to put in the time.
   ``I enjoy coming in and `Jessuping around' for a while. I'll
look in the mirror and try to find him. I lift a couple of
weights.''
   Lang says some aspects of characters he plays often stick with
him off the stage.
   ``But I keep a pretty sharp lasso on them, too. I haven't been
marching the troops at home.''
   And he made sure that Harry Black, ``the total wreck of a human
being'' he plays in the new film ``Last Exit to Brooklyn,'' stayed
at the movie's all-night shoots.
   ``A Few Good Men'' has been bought _ but not cast _ for a movie.
   Lang and his wife of 10 years met when she designed his costume
for a TV drama. ``I think big families are coming back,'' he says.
``We have a girl, two boys and are expecting a girl.''
   His father, Eugene Lang, a company president, told 61
sixth-graders in Harlem in 1981 that if they finished high school,
he'd pay their college tuition. He later founded the I Have a Dream
Foundation, which now has 130 sponsors in 32 cities backing more
than 8,000 children.
   ``He's a guy who's always looking for outlets for his own
creativity and he found it in a really unique way,'' says the
younger Lang.
   About his own profession, Lang says: ``I think I was born to act
and I'm very lucky that I just knew that. I don't do it for
therapy. I'm less neurotic about acting than I am about most other
things.''
   In ``A Few Good Men,'' a Marine private has died and two Marines
are accused of murder. A lawyer, played by Tom Hulce, suspects
Jessup of being behind the death.
   Jessup is one of the more interesting, complex characters Lang
has played. ``He has not turned into an egomaniac,'' Lang says. ``I
think he manipulates the power of the office and the power of his
personality.''
   ``Jessup is a great quoter. The author (Aaron Sorkin) wanted to
endow him with a certain arcane elegance, to make him not just a
contemporary figure but a larger-than-life figure who can speak
with real authority on literature and poetry.
   ``I think we associate Jessup with a passion. Yeats said the
worst are full of a passionate intensity while the best lack all
conviction. In that sense you could say Jessup is one of the worst.
He is not a skeptic in an age of skepticism and he is not a cynic
in an age of cynicism. Neither is he a blind believer. He is a man
who has chosen a path for himself, whether we admire that path or
not.
   ``When Jessup goes, he flames out. He is not `seeking
treatment.' He says, `This is who I am.'''
   Lang recently played a different type of soldier, a homeless
Vietnam vet, in Steve Tesich's ``Speed of Darkness'' in Chicago.
He'll probably repeat it on Broadway.
   Lang played Happy when Dustin Hoffman starred in ``Death of a
Salesman'' on Broadway and was Rosencrantz in an off-Broadway
revival of ``Rosencrantz and Gildenstern Are Dead.''
   He wants to play Hamlet, having played Horatio to Christopher
Walken's Hamlet in 1982. And he'd like to use his ``character
singing voice'' in Gilbert and Sullivan, his childhood theatrical
love.
   ``I'd be a good Jack Point in `The Yeomen of the Guard,''' he
says. ``If anybody asked me to do it, I'd have a very hard time
turning it down.''

<HEAD>Unemployment Greatest Threat to New Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Noriega is gone, but one-third of
Panamanians are out of work and unemployment has become the
greatest threat to the new government.
   ``It has to be resolved or the country will go into a spiral of
robberies ... strikes, demonstrations against the government and
backlash against the U.S.,'' said Carlos Rodriguez, a Panamanian
who is vice president of the American Chamber of Commerce.
   For now, there seems to be no opposition to President Guillermo
Endara's new government. The end of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's
corrupt, repressive dictatorship and the lifting of U.S. economic
sanctions have brought hope.
   The government is scratching to keep itself afloat, however, and
has nothing to invest in reactivating the economy. It is looking to
U.S. aid and private enterprise to do the job.
   Jorge Heraza, 21, finished high school three years ago with a
specialty in commercial accounting, which seemed sensible in an
economy that is 70 percent to 80 percent services. He still fills
out job applications, and still has no job.
   The Dec. 20 invasion that ousted Noriega and installed Endara
seemed like a good idea, he said, ``but they must follow through.
They say they're going to give jobs, but unemployment _ with what
has happened, it is worse.''
   Government officials say about 33 percent of the work force,
estimated at 650,000 people, is unemployed.
   Looting and vandalism that accompanied the invasion caused about
90 percent of businesses to close, raising the jobless figure from
about 20 percent. Before the political crisis began in 1987, about
10 percent of Panamanians did not have jobs.
   Endara fasted during the first 12 days of March to dramatize
Panama's economic problems. He has criticized the slow pace of U.S.
aid and of freeing government funds frozen during the Noriega
regime.
   ``People cannot eat democracy,'' the president said. ``There
could be popular unrest unless there are some quick solutions. The
congressional delay of approval endangers our democracy.''
   Of the Bush administration's $1 billion package, Congress has
approved $43 million to rebuild the Chorrillo neighborhood, which
was destroyed in the invasion, and the start of credit the
administration says is worth $500 million.
   Panamanians say they are well-equipped to use aid effectively.
   ``Panama is not a basket case like some other countries,'' said
Rodriguez, the general manager of Colgate-Palmolive's operations in
Panama. ``It has good infrastructure, a good entrepreneurial
class.''
   With the U.S. dollar as its currency, Panama was a thriving
international banking and trade center.
   That ended with the political crisis created by U.S. indictments
of Noriega for drug trafficking, his dismissal of presidents, the
closing of banks for nine weeks in 1988 and U.S. economic sanctions.
   Assets in the cluster of gleaming, modern banking towers
plummeted from $40 billion in June 1987 to less than $15 million
two years later.
   On streets that had teemed with visitors buying cameras,
electronic equipment, watches and tailored suits, business slowed
to a trickle.
   The gross national product fell 20 percent in 1988 and 7.5
percent more in 1989. Much of the government's revenue was lost to
corruption.
   ``If you stop the corruption, that by itself is income. It was
that bad,'' said Guillermo Ford, the second vice president and
planning minister.
   Since the invasion, the government has survived on gradually
improving tax revenue and partial release of the $390 million in
frozen funds.
   ``There is a change in mentality'' about taxes, said Willie
Cochez, the new mayor of Panama City. ``They know people like
President Endara will not steal the money and they decide to pay.''
   Officials continue plugging corruption leaks. Kindergartens are
$3,000 a month better off since Cochez sent a department head to
jail for stealing that much.
   New officials cut their own salaries, which saves $2.1 million a
year. Endara's pay was reduced from $10,000 a month to $7,000.
   Until Panama pays the $540 million in arrears on its $5.2
billion foreign debt, it will not be eligible for new loans.
   Rodriguez, the businessman, feels Panamanians may be too
optimistic.
   ``People probably feel the problems are over and they are not,''
he said. ``They probably think it will rebound to pre-1987 in three
months and it will not.''
   He said unemployment is a ``time bomb against the Endara
government or any democratic government.''
   Government strategy is to strengthen the private sector by
selling state-owned Air Panama, sugar mills and cement and citrus
processing plants, Ford said.
   Some businessmen even suggest that the Panama Canal, to be
turned over to Panama at the end of 1999, could be operated as a
concession.
   A major worry in this strategy is reducing the payroll of
150,000 before there are enough new jobs for the people dismissed.
   Crime has skyrocketed because of unemployment and because so
many weapons are in the hands of paramilitary groups set up by
Noriega. Police said murders have gone up from four a month to 30.
   For the long term, Rodriguez said, officials speak of a
U.S.-Panama free trade agreement similar to those the United States
has with Canada and Israel.
   Panama has had the Colon free-trade zone for years and it was
not seriously affected by the crisis. Officials are promoting
establishment of new in-bond plants there, which assemble products
for export, and expansion of existing ones.
   The zone also does a brisk trade in transshipment of goods.
   International banking could revive, but is considered unlikely
to regain its former prominence. Panamanians dismiss concerns that
the banks could again become a haven for drug money and say current
secrecy laws allow access to information when laundering is
suspected.
   ``The perception in Panama is that the U.S. is delaying approval
of the economic recovery package to squeeze out tighter
restrictions on banking, tighter restrictions on Cuba-related
companies,'' Rodriguez said.
   Ruben Dario Carles, a former banker and now the government's
comptroller, said: ``We cannot sit and wait. We have to deliver the
goods. We have to get this thing moving.
   ``Every unemployed person has a reason to protest and it will be
bad if 200,000 protest.''

   Athletes run for many reasons, but members of the Fifty-Plus
Runners' Association have found a new one: They run for science.
   Of course, the members run for all those other reasons, too:
keeping fit, losing weight, improving their heart and lungs,
dealing with tension or depression, or becoming or staying
competitive.
   Their personal goals dovetail nicely with researchers' desires
to learn more about the effects of extended physical activity on
older people.
   ``We see this organization as a role model, a pioneering group.
It's a whole new lifestyle for older men and women,'' said Keith
Johnsgard, president of Fifty-Plus and a professor at San Jose
State University in California. ``They don't have to live the
sedentary life that older people do or are expected to.''
   Fifty-Plus is not a running club. Sponsored by the Center for
Research in Disease Prevention at Stanford University, its goal is
to gather a list of highly active seniors for researchers to plumb.
Fifty-Plus has 1,600 members.
   Topics already being studied include how continued physical
exercise affects osteoarthritis and osteoporosis. Researchers have
found that older runners, male and female, had about 40 percent
more bone mineral _ and no more tendencies toward osteoarthritis in
their knees _ than seniors who don't exercise.
   ``Before this, it was generally thought that people who spent a
lot of time running would invariably damage their knees,'' said
Peter Wood, a biochemist, former Fifty-Plus president and co-author
of the study.
   Wood said good mineral density was important, especially for
women, because it helped prevent problems like dowager's hump or
osteoporosis.
   Researchers also have found that Fifty-Plus members consumed 40
percent to 60 percent more calories daily than their sedentary
peers _ but had higher levels of the ``good'' cholesterol
(high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), which has been associated
with a relatively low risk of heart disease.
   ``When you are eating a good amount, you are more likely to get
an adequate supply of nutrients _ and for women a good supply of
calcium,'' Wood said.
   The group's most recent survey found that 85 percent of its
members were men. They averaged 59.8 years old, have been running
for 13.7 years and covered 26.4 miles per week. Forty-five percent
had completed a marathon (26.2 miles) and the vast majority had run
at least one 10-kilometer (6.2 miles) race.
   Fifty-Plus women averaged 58.8 years, had been running for 9.5
years and covered an average of 21.2 miles a week.
   Fifty-Plus now is looking for a corporate sponsor to help
increase its membership and attract a wider group of scientists.
   ``We'd like to expand membership, and get some really good
long-term studies going,'' Johnsgard said. ``Bring in some young,
hot-shot epidemiologist who can study us until we're all dead. We
are too old to do the really long-term stuff.''
   Several members cited the research emphasis as the reason they
joined Fifty-Plus.
   ``The studies attracted me to it,'' said Kent Gartner, 56, a
cell biologist at Memphis State University who has been running for
20 years.
   ``The research they're doing is not only interesting, it's
important,'' said Bob Binzer, 67, of Madison, Ind. ``It's
inspiring, and you get good advice from the organization.''
   Binzer was referring to the association's quarterly newsletter,
which summarizes research involving members and publishes health
and sports-related articles.
   ``I really enjoy the newsletter and it's great they're doing
this research,'' agreed Betty Brinkmann, 55, of Brighton, Colo. A
dietician, she says she often uses information from the newsletter
in her own work with cardiovascular rehabilitation patients.
   Johnsgard, a clinical psychologist, has studied what prompts
seniors to begin running and then keep running using Fifty-Plus
members. The book that resulted, ``The Exercise Prescription for
Depression and Anxiety,'' examines the beneficial effects of
continued physical activity on seniors' mental health.
   The athletes get together once a year _ this year, they'll meet
Sunday at Stanford _ for a seminar and business meeting, a generous
pasta dinner and an eight-kilometer run. Age-group categories for
the race begin at 50 and go up to 100 in five-year intervals, with
nearly 400 runners expected.
   ``It's a gathering of the brothers and the sisters _ a tribal
thing,'' Johnsgard said. ``People who exercise regularly in the
U.S. are unusual, but people over 50 who exercise are extremely
rare. It's like coming home.''

   The entry requirements are few.
   ``You have to be an active downhill skier. You must be 70 years
of age,'' says Lloyd T. Lambert, founder of the 70-Plus Ski Club.
``You pay $5 for a lifetime membership.''
   The claims more than 5,500 members across the country.
   ``I'm not that speedy any more, but we've got some really,
really hot shots,'' said Lambert, 89, who heads the group from his
home in Ballston Lake.
   Senior citizens are staying in shape on the slopes in droves
these days, and the trend shows no signs of slowing. With older
Americans keener than ever to stay active, skiing is an ideal way
to exercise through the winter.
   ``It's caught on now to where it (membership) has grown 75
percent a year,'' said Bill Vandersluin, 59, spokesman for The Over
The Hill Gang, an elderly skiers group based in Aurora, Colo.
   One member from Los Angeles is living proof ``there's never any
shortage of energy'' in the group, said Vandersluin.
   ``She skis like a demon,'' he said. ``She's 86, and she has no
grey hair.''
   The Over The Hill Gang, which offers its 2,400 members white
water rafting, deep sea fishing and hiking as well as skiing trips,
has a minimum membership age of 50.
   About 6.8 percent of the 18 million to 20 million skiers in the
United States are 55 or older, said Chris Stoddard, a spokesman for
the United Ski Industries Association. The association is a
national trade group for ski areas and ski equipment suppliers.
   The 70-Plus Ski Club and The Over The Hill Gang hold ski
gatherings across the country and provide their members with
information about where they can ski for free or at discount rates.
   Three hundred older skiers descended on the Catskills in New
York earlier this month for the 70-Plus Ski Club's annual meeting
and races at Hunter Mountain.
   Lambert got back from a 70-Plus trip to Switzerland last month,
but he's off again for more skiing in July, this time to Argentina.
   Injuries among elderly skiers are few and the accidents they
suffer often have little to do with their age, Lambert said.
   ``These guys on snow boards have run into a few of our
members,'' said Lambert. ``One had a broken shoulder, another had
broken ribs, and another one was bumped around.''
   Injuries on the slopes have been reduced from 7.7 accidents per
1,000 ski visits in the 1950s to 2.5 injuries per 1,000 visits
today, according to Stoddard.
   ``Skiing has an image that you're going to fall and break
something,'' he said. ``That image is just not true.''
   Stoddard said many older skiers avoid injury because they are
usually experienced, and he attributed the overall drop in skiing
injuries to improvements in boot bindings and snow making and
grooming.
   Lambert recalls pine toe-strap skies he owned when he first hit
the slopes in 1915.
   ``You couldn't turn or do anything that you could today, because
you had nothing to hold your heel in place,'' Lambert said. ``If
you wanted to stop you had to fall down or kick the skis off.''

<HEAD>Thurmond: A Senator in His 90s for the '90s?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once introduced as a ``senator in his 90s for
the `90s,'' J. Strom Thurmond is running for re-election and
neither his age nor his Dixiecrat past looks like a serious
obstacle to a seventh term.
   ``He has co-opted damn near everybody in South Carolina in one
fashion or another,'' said Don Fowler, a Democratic political
consultant, trying to explain why his party was having so much
trouble finding a candidate to oppose the 87-year-old Republican
senator.
   ``Thurmond has this very unique status in the state where it
would be almost an act of discourtesy to run against him, I think
that's how some of these people perceive it,'' said Earl Black, a
political scientist at the University of South Carolina.
   ``Regardless of your political views, everyone has great
affection for him,'' said Phil Lader, the Democrat contemplating a
run against Thurmond.
   Lader, a 44-year-old businessman, 2 years old in 1948 when
Thurmond, then governor of South Carolina, ran for president as a
Dixiecrat, a candidacy driven by opposition to integration.
   ``All the laws of Washington, and all the bayonets of the Army,
cannot force the Negro into our homes, our schools, our churches
and our places of recreation,'' Thurmond vowed.
   That was 42 years ago. Times changed and so did Thurmond. Not as
fast maybe, but he changed.
   ``People who live in contemporary times recognize that people
change,'' said Theo Mitchell, a state senator planning to challenge
Republican Gov. Carroll Campbell in November.
   Mitchell is black and said that despite Thurmond's
segregationist past, the senator ``has support in the black
community.''
   ``People have done things in bygone eras that they certainly
wouldn't do now,'' said Mitchell. ``Attitudes change as well as
times.''
   Thurmond lobbied to get President Nixon to appoint a black to
the federal bench and supported legislation to make Martin Luther
King Jr.'s birthday a national holiday.
   Those were among the high-profile stands that won Thurmond
support among blacks. Equally important are day-to-day constituent
services performed by his staff _ locating the lost Social Security
check, speeding veterans' benefits.
   ``People who have problems know that they can get quick
responses'' from Thurmond's staff, said Black.
   Call him beloved. Call him respected and a master of constituent
services. But he also is 87 years old.
   It was Lee Atwater, a Thurmond protege and now Republican Party
chairman, who once was introducing the senator at a dinner and
joked that Thurmond should use the slogan ``A senator in his 90s
for the `90s'' for his next re-election campaign.
   The audience roared. The senator looked a bit uncertain for a
moment and then joined in the laughter.
   Thurmond was born nine years before Ronald Reagan. He made his
Dixiecrat bid for the White House three years before Reagan starred
in ``Bedtime for Bonzo.''
   This time around, Thurmond already is running campaign
commercials on South Carolina television stations. They show the
senator bounding up the steps of the U.S. Capitol and doing
push-ups in his office.
   An even bigger part of the legend of eternal youth is the
Thurmond family. His wife, Nancy, is a former beauty queen, who
married the senator when he was in his 60s and she was not yet 20.
They went on to have four children.
   Lader said he would not directly raise age as an issue.
   ``It's up to the voters, not me to determine whether a senator
who would be in his 90s for most of his term is serving
effectively,'' he said.
   The Senate Democratic campaign committee has been urging Lader
to make the run, but he described himself as taking his time about
making a decision.
   Thousands of South Carolinians have received calls from Thurmond
during his long career, Lader among them.
   ``The last call that I got on my way to my wedding 10 years ago,
was from Senator Thurmond,'' he recalled. ``He called to wish me
well.''

   Lennie Williams smiles as she talks of her dead
husband and the small home he helped her build 42 years ago.
   For the moment, at least, the poverty-stricken, 77-year-old
widow seems unaware that Transamerica Corp. wants her worn but tidy
home because she can't make payments of $499 a month.
   Mrs. Williams, who supports herself on $438 a month, doesn't
remember her husband died 12 years ago, or that she put up the
house, in a working-class Phoenix neighborhood, as security for a
loan taken out by her former son-in-law in 1987.
   The Transamerica loan officer who handled the transaction says
he doubts Mrs. Williams knew what she was doing. The son-in-law has
disappeared.
   State Rep. Sandra Kennedy, who has known Mrs. Williams for more
than 12 years, believes Mrs. Williams was confused in 1987. So does
the doctor treating her at the time she signed the loan papers.
   She couldn't even remember what pills to take, said the doctor,
Tali Arik.
   Alfred Rogers, a Maricopa County Superior Court judge who has
heard pretrial testimony in Mrs. Williams' case, says it's likely
that Transamerica, which measures profits in the hundreds of
millions of dollars, knew or should have known Mrs. Williams was
defrauded.
   Transamerica, which used the slogan ``Our heart is everywhere''
on its latest annual report, is not persuaded. The San
Francisco-based financial giant is pressing for trial and demanding
Mrs. Williams make payments.
   The lawsuit was filed by Mrs. Williams and her legal guardian
and seeks to block Transamerica Financial Services Inc., a
subsidiary, from foreclosing. It also seeks to void her part of the
contract and win damages. No trial has been scheduled.
   The case is the latest in a series involving consumer-loan
companies, and comes at a time when the collapse of many thrifts
has forced more middle-class borrowers to turn to them.
   In Arizona alone, ITT Financial Services paid $1.7 million to
settle one class-action lawsuit, and Household Finance Corp. paid
about $4 million to settle another. Transamerica Financial Services
has already offered to pay about $4 million to settle a
class-action lawsuit that accuses it of gouging poor and
middle-income borrowers.
   Transamerica officials did not return repeated calls seeking
comment on the Williams case. But one of its attorneys, Robert
Miles, said the company believes it is entitled to the property.
Miles said he could not discuss the case in detail.
   Arizona Superintendent of Banks William H. Rivoir III said
confidentiality laws prohibit him from saying whether his agency is
investigating Mrs. Williams' case.
   Loan-industry lobbyists say this case must be an aberration.
However, Bill Morris, director of litigation at Southern Arizona
Legal Aid in Tucson and chief architect of the class-action suits,
said the situation is believed to occur frequently.
   After Rogers issued a preliminary injunction blocking
Transamerica from foreclosing, the company insisted Mrs. Williams
post bond of $499 a month _ $61 more than her monthly income.
   At a minimum, it said, she should post a $20,000 down payment
and pay $425 a month thereafter.
   The amount was bargained down to $150 a month, without the down
payment, after Mrs. Williams' lawyer threatened to take the case to
higher courts and set a statewide precedent if successful.
   Miles said the bond was needed to make sure the case goes to
trial quickly. But Doug Erickson, one of Mrs. Williams' lawyers,
says he's already agreed to a speedy trial.
   Before the foreclosure action Mrs. Williams paid $800 and
offered to pay an additional $350 a month, with help from relatives.
   Sworn testimony by the loan officer shows it was Mrs. Williams'
son-in-law, William Smith, who wanted the money in the first place.
   Smith had married Mrs. Williams' daughter Alma but hadn't lived
with her for years, said Ms. Kennedy and Rachel Freeman, Mrs.
Williams' great-niece and recently appointed legal guardian.
   Alma died early in 1987. Months later, Smith came around and
promised he would help fix Mrs. Williams' home, according to Ms.
Freeman.
   Instead, he allegedly took her to Transamerica, had her co-sign
a $32,000 loan and disappeared. Mrs. Williams' attorneys have
obtained a judgment against him, but it's of little value since
they don't know where he is.
   The loan officer, Patrick Rajski, said Smith would not have
qualified for a loan without the house as security.
   With an interest rate of nearly 18 percent plus 8 points in
prepaid charges, the loan called for total payments of $89,820, or
$499 a month over 15 years.
   Before bringing Mrs. Williams in for the loan-signing, Smith
``said that the least I said to her about the loan the better off
it would be,'' Rajski added in sworn testimony before Rogers.
   ``I felt uneasy about it,'' he testified, adding that he went
through with the loan anyway and never told Mrs. Williams she could
lose her home.
   ``I didn't want to bring up the fact that we could foreclose on
your home, people don't want to hear this,'' Rajski said. ``When
you close a loan, you try to get through with it, you say
everything you have to say and no more.''
   ``I really don't think that she fully understood,'' said Rajski,
who has left Transamerica for another sales job.
   ``I went over the loan papers,'' he said. ``When she left, was I
satisfied that she knew what she was getting into? No.''
   Sitting at home last week, Mrs. Williams appeared unaware of the
problem. Asked how she spent her days, for example, she replied,
``I work for white people,'' referring to domestic work she has not
done for years.
   ``It was after her heart attack that she just kind of floated
away,'' said Ms. Kennedy. ``It hurt my heart when her daughter
died, because she got worse.''
   Prescription medicine alone consumes about $80 a month of the
$438 Mrs. Williams gets from Social Security and a veteran's
pension, according to Ms. Freeman, who moved in with her great-aunt
and found lawyers to help her after Transamerica threatened
foreclosure.
   The paint is peeling and the cheap carpeting is worn, but the
photos and trinkets of a lifetime are all neatly in place, and Ms.
Freeman and her son have patched the roof, repaired the water
heater and more since moving in to the house, on a
7,500-square-foot lot in south Phoenix.
   If Transamerica gets its way, Mrs. Williams ``would be put out
on the street with nowhere to go,'' Ms. Kennedy says. ``I'm
surprised she's made it this far.''

   Welcome to Ashley, North Dakota. Retirement
haven.
   Retirement haven?
   ``I never heard of it before,'' said Katie Sloan, a housing
specialist with the American Association of Retired Persons in
Washington, D.C.
   Leaders of Ashley, a farm town of about 1,200 people near the
South Dakota border, plan to change that.
   The town has no luxury condos or sandy beaches. But it has other
appeals.
   ``You can get up at 3 a.m. and go for a walk, and no one cares.
You can go for a walk to the park to see the sun rise,'' said
Robert Dockter, whose father, Harold Dockter, 69, retired in Ashley.
   As you drive into Ashley along North Dakota Highway 11, there's
the Lake Hoskins Recreation Area, then farm fields with gray grain
elevators standing guard along the railroad tracks.
   Main Street has the McIntosh County Bank, a hardware store, two
cafes and City Hall.
   Leo Geiger, administrator of the Ashley Medical Center, and Bud
Overbo, a bank vice president, came up with the plan to advertise
Ashley in magazines read by retirees. They thought of attracting
retired people about a year ago as a way to increase the population
and preserve existing jobs.
   ``You've got to have doctors, but you can't attract doctors
unless you have enough bodies,'' said Geiger, 61, who says he's
interested in retiring in Ashley himself.
   ``Retirees can sell their homes and buy a more moderate home in
Ashley. They'd be able to use the interest to live on,'' added City
Councilman Myron Schlepp, an insurance salesman.
   The retirement plan has no organized opposition, though some
worry their community will age too much, council members said.
   People thinking of retiring in Ashley might want to know:
   _It sits on prairie land, 80 miles from Aberdeen, S.D., the
nearest big city. St. Paul, Minn., is 350 miles east. A freight
train runs through town once a week during harvest time, once every
two or three weeks otherwise.
   _The average three-bedroom home costs $30,000.
   _The city has a nine-hole golf course with sand greens, pinochle
and gin tournaments, and frequent dances and church and civic
group-sponsored social events.
   _Ashley notes its one full-time police officer, two police
vehicles and two jail cells as evidence of a crime-free environment.
   _The city is the seat of McIntosh County, with a 1.6 percent
unemployment rate. The medical center, with 26 hospital beds and 51
nursing home beds, is Ashley's largest employer.
   The new, not-for-profit Ashley Development Corp. was formed by
the business people of Ashley, who hope to get grant money to
promote Ashley in retirement magazines, Dockter said. But it may be
an uphill battle.
   ``Every once in a while we do get a call from a community
interested in enhancing its tax base,'' Sloan said in Washington.
``But the reality is that most retirees don't move very far.''
   Still, the biggest promotional obstacle may be the weather. In
January, the National Weather Service says, the average high
temperature is 18 degrees, with the average low at 4 below zero.

   As they agonize over yet another tax season and an
April 15 deadline, taxpayers should remember that, with careful
planning, many tax-saving ideas are available.
   Following are three significant tax-saving tips for people over
55 that should be considered when preparing returns.
   _Sale of a Home:
   If you sold your home during 1989, there are several options. If
the sale resulted in a loss, the loss generally is a non-deductable
personal loss. However, a gain on the sale may qualify for special
tax treatment.
   If a taxpayer buys a new principal residence within two years of
the date of sale of the old principal residence, the taxpayer will
not be required to pay tax on all the gain from the sale. The
taxpayer will pay tax on the gain only to the extent that the
``adjusted sales price'' of the old residence exceeds the cost of
the new one. The ``adjusted sales price'' equals the selling price
of the residence, reduced by sales expenses, such as advertising,
commissions and legal fees; and further reduced by expenses for
decorating and repairing to help sell the old home.
   Only expenses for work performed within 90 days before the
contract to sell was signed, and paid for within 30 days after the
sale, qualify. Capital expenses, such as permanent improvements or
replacements, are added to the value of the home.
   If the cost of the new residence exceeds the adjusted sales
price of the old one, no tax is paid on the sale. This is known as
a rollover of the gain, or a Section 1034 exchange. This treatment
is automatic if a new home is purchased. In this situation, the
basis (tax cost) of the new residence will be reduced by the amount
of gain postponed.
   If the taxpayer sells a principal residence but does not replace
it, it still may be possible to qualify for special tax treatment.
If the taxpayer is 55 or older on the date of the sale, he or she
may be able to exclude up to $125,000 of gain on the sale. Also the
taxpayer must have used the residence as his or her ``main home''
for at least three years during the five years before the sale. The
election to exclude the gain from the sale is available only once
in a lifetime and is made on Part 1 of Form 2119.
   _Standard Deductions and Additional Considerations:
   The taxpayer is allowed to deduct the greater of the standard
deduction or total itemized deductions. The amount of the standard
deduction is dependent upon the taxpayer's filing status.
   Married couples filing jointly are entitled to a $5,200 standard
deduction. Single taxpayers are entitled to a $3,100 standard
deduction. The standard deduction for heads of households is
$4,550, and for married people filing separately, $2,600.
   In addition, married people who are 65 or older, or blind, are
entitled to an additional standard deduction of $600 ($1,200 if
both 65 and blind). Single taxpayers who are 65 or older, or blind,
are entitled to an additional standard deduction of $750 ($1,500 if
both).
   If the taxpayer was completely blind as of Dec. 31, 1989, a
statement should be attached to the tax return describing the
condition. If the taxpayer was partially blind, a certified
statement from an eye doctor must be attached to the return. The
attachment must state that the taxpayer's vision cannot be
corrected with glasses or contacts to be better than 20-200 in the
better eye, or that the taxpayer's field of vision is 20 degrees or
less.
   _Medicare Surtax:
   Finally, for taxpayers eligible for Medicare, Congress repealed
the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act in December. Because the
1989 tax forms were published before the repeal, lines are included
on the form that reflect the supplemental Medicare surtax _ line 54
on Form 1040, and line 23 on Form 1040A. In filling out the return,
taxpayers may leave the line blank or fill it in with a zero.
   If taxpayers already have made payments, through additional
estimated tax payments or additional withholdings, they are
entitled to a refund. Even if no income tax is owed, a return must
be filed to get a refund.
   A credit for amounts paid through withholding can be claimed by
reflecting those amounts on line 56 of Form 1040, or line 25a of
Form 1040A. The additions made through estimated tax payments can
be shown on line 57 of Form 1040.

   Summer or winter, outdoors or in, what
is gardening without a tomato?
   Growing a tomato under lights is easy _ if you you've got space,
the right plant and can wait 100 days. My wife kindly let me have
space in her area of our fluorescent stand to let me raise my first
indoor tomato.
   Why would anyone want to do this? I can't answer for others, but
I got a big sense of accomplishment out of seeing the blossoms come
and the fruit set, enlarge and finally redden. I've raised a string
bean indoors, but the thrill was nowhere the same. Perhaps it's
because of America's special relation to tomatoes, perennially
voted our favorte garden vegetable.
   For 35 years or so, my wife and I have shared a custom-built,
four-tiered stand along a wall of our dining room. She has the deep
middle shelves for flowers and leafy plants and I occupy the
shallower top and bottom tiers for winter salad greens and for
starting seeds in spring. We try to keep out of each other's way.
   Then, a couple of years ago, I saw a newspaper article saying
windowsill tomatoes, using sunlight, are easy with certain
varieties. Why not under fluorescents, I asked my wife, who,
knowing it would mean intrusion on her turf, surprisingly said,
``All right, go ahead.''
   I tried two of the recommended varieties, Pixie and Sub-Arctic,
both of which had already done well in my outdoor garden. They're
small tomatoes, bearing early and abundantly. Sub-Arctic has a
particularly interesting past. It's an offspring of international
tests, including Soviet trials in Siberia, to develop
cold-resistant varieties. Canadians even bred one to fruit on
Hudson Bay.
   In my fluorescent adventure, I was faced with the problem that
the tubes are infinitely weaker than sunlight. While I raise tomato
seedlings under lights every year, growing plants to fruiting stage
was a different challenge.
   I started both tomoatoes early in January in flats of potting
soil, keeping them very close to the lights, an inch or so, so that
the newly sprouting seedlings would not get leggy. I kept notes on
the progress of each.
   By Jan. 28, Sub-Arctic was about eight inches tall while Pixie
was only three. On Jan. 31, I transplanted one Sub-Arctic and one
Pixie into six-inch pots. Sub-Arctic blossomed Feb. 24 and set its
first fruit March 8. This turned red the week of April 12 and I ate
it April 20, about 100 days after I sowed the seed. Sweet and nice.
From then until the end of July, this plant produced a dozen
tomatoes, all a deeper red than their outdoor version and sweeter,
too, it seemed to me.
   Sub-Arctic ran away with the show. Pixie grew into a sturdy
plant but never blossomed under the lights. Finally I planted it
outdoors in June, and it started blossoming almost immediately in
the sun, producing its first red fruit July 28.
   During their indoor careers, I sometimes forgot to water the
plants until I noticed they were drooping. Then I rushed to the
rescue with a long-nosed watering can, and they picked up right
away. I fertilized occasionally with a soluble plant food.
   Sub-Arctic grew over a couple of feet tall and I tied it to the
stand. Its upper reaches meandered along the lights (and my wife's
gloxinias) and I had to trim it occasionally. Since then, I've
found a variety named Florida Petite that grows only a foot tall
out of four-inch pots and requires no sacrifices from my wife.
   My original experiment needed no unusal skills or horticultural
heroics. But in a long gardening career, nothing has quite matched
the special pleasure of watching that first red fruit complete its
voyage to maturity under my dining room tubes.

   Oil prices will likely slide further in
the weeks ahead despite OPEC's fresh call for restraints on crude
production, analysts said.
   Ministers of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, hoping to keep the target price of oil at $18 a barrel,
wound up a special meeting Saturday by urging its members to be
cautious with their output during the second quarter.
   ``Prices are going to come under a lot of pressure,'' predicted
Peter Gignoux, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in
London. However, the softening of oil prices will likely have
little impact on gasoline prices at the pump.

   U.S. industrial output rose 0.6 percent in
February, the government reported, but the rise reflected a
resumption of automobile production and practically no
strengthening elsewhere.
   Thousands of autoworkers, who were laid off in January as
manufacturers trimmed bloated inventories, returned to production
lines in February and contributed nearly all of the increase in
industrial output, the Federal Reserve reported Friday.

   Topsy-turvy weather is sending wholesale
inflation on a roller-coaster ride so far this year, with prices
unchanged in February after a steep increase a month earlier.
   A sharp drop in energy prices offset increases for other items
and held the Labor Department's Producer Price Index steady overall
last month, the government said Friday.
   In another report, housing starts fell 7 percent in February but
remained well above the level of the last 11 months of 1989.
Analysts said the building pace could not be maintained.

<TEXT>
   Dan Rostenkowski is a comfortable old
politician, a powerful House committee chairman with a huge staff,
a doting legion of lobbyists and a million bucks in his campaign
chest with no challenger in sight.
   Maybe that's the kind of pol it takes to kick new life into a
budget debate which until now has produced only stalemate and
fiscal chicanery.
   The Illinois Democrat, known more for his clout than his daring,
last week entered the seemingly hopeless budget struggle with a
splash. To eliminate the $100 billion-plus federal deficits, he
called on all sides to abandon their long-held positions. His
advice includes:
   President Bush _ Raise income taxes.
   Democrats _ Cut Social Security.
   Pentagon _ Reduce spending.
   Bureaucrats _ Freeze programs.
   Lobbyists _ The store is closed.
   It's what some call a ``gore everyone's ox'' strategy _ to the
tune of $500 billion over five years.
   The proposal to freeze Social Security cost-of-living
adjustments seems a thumbed nose to the elderly who, offended by
Rostenkowski's support of the now-defunct catastrophic health care
plan, attacked his car last year. The domestic spending freeze
tells fellow Democrats to forget about spending any ``peace
dividend'' from defense cuts made in the wake of the Eastern
European revolution.
   By ruling out any tax cut, Rostenkowski rejects an idea
popularized in his own party by Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
who suggests cutting Social Security taxes rather than using the
revenue to cut the deficit.
   ``Some within my own party decided they should fight
irresponsibility with irresponsibility,'' Rostenkowski said.
   Rostenkowski began selling the plan this past weekend in
speeches before some of the very interest groups who have made his
life so comfortable with generous speaking fees and campaign
donations.
   ``The question is whether I can convince you that deficit
reduction and a healthy economy are more important for your
business than such special incentives'' as tax breaks, he told the
Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association.
   Rostenkowski's proposal to raise income taxes on the wealthy
isn't just a challenge to Bush. It also abandons his own efforts to
protect the 1986 tax ``reform'' bill that probably will be cited as
the most sweeping achievement in Rostenkowski's three decades in
Congress.
   In an interview, Rostenkowski pushed aside questions seeking a
personal agenda in his plan.
   ``You've got to accept the fact that I'm viewed as the chairman
of the committee that has 75 percent of the (deficit-reduction)
legislation in its jurisdiction,'' he said.
   ``I'm supposed to provide some leadership or some cover... I
just felt my colleagues would expect this of me,'' he said.
   Rostenkowski was not too modest to suggest that he might provide
some leadership for Bush. ``Many of us felt that President Bush's
commitment to no new taxes was only a one-year commitment,'' he
said.
   Distrust is the biggest obstacle to a deficit-reduction plan
this year, he said. That distrust has a long history.
   Many in Congress _ both Democrats and Republicans _ proposed
similarly daring plans in the mid-1980s. The Republicans lost
control of the Senate after their 1985 budget proposed Social
Security cuts, and former House Speaker Jim Wright was vilified for
proposing tax increases while Congress was getting a pay increase.
   Like others before him, Rostenkowski says ``there is the basis
for doing something like this if everyone will step forward at the
same time.'' So far, Rostenkowski is marching alone.
   Bush greeted the plan with enough rhetorical warmth to keep it
alive but refused to compromise his positions. Loyal House
Republicans portrayed it as another example of Democrats wanting to
raise taxes.
   Rostenkowski's Democratic colleagues, meantime, praised him as
brave but called his plan unrealistic until Bush changes his tune.
Some were distrustful of Rostenkowski's chummy relationship with
Bush.
   ``Everyone is suspicious of the president,'' Rostenkowski said.
Without Bush's overt support, Rostenkowski concedes any deficit
reduction plan is dead. But he believes the president ``blinked a
little bit'' this time.
   Rumored to be considering retirement, Rostenkowski seems worried
about his generation's legacy _ a legacy thus far of debt and a
declining standard of living. And he hopes Bush and the senior
members of Congress also are worried enough to ``go to Camp David
and stamp something out that ... both Republicans and Democrats
could accept.''
   Where others see only deadlock, Rostenkowski sees potential for
compromise and progress. Maybe he thinks he has the right
combination of skill, clout and personal security to win _ and
maybe just by shaking up a moribund debate, he already has.

   Nearly seven weeks after The National made a
splashy debut, central New Jersey commuters are finding they can
sleep in and still get a copy of the daily sports newspaper for
their 40-mile train ride to New York.
   John Giorgianni, owner of the Bottom of the Hill newsstand in
suburban New Brunswick, N.J., said he routinely ends up with 30 or
more unsold copies these days. In the days after the newspaper's
Jan. 31 premiere, late-rising commuters often found the paper was
sold out.
   ``Those first three weeks were phenomenal,'' Giorgianni said.
   The newspaper's executives say they anticipated a fall-off in
circulation after the paper's launch and insist that circulation
and ad sales are matching their expectations. They plan to boost
distribution by 40 percent soon by making the paper available at
more outlets around its first three markets _ New York, Chicago and
Los Angeles.
   But media analysts say it is too soon to say whether The
National can survive in the publishing big leagues. They want to
see how it handles expansion beyond its current markets and whether
it can command a steady readership.
   Publisher Peter Price said The National is selling about 200,000
of the 250,000 copies it prints every day, matching the target set
for the paper.
   The paper, which costs 50 cents a copy, is distributed Sunday
through Friday and plans are to add six to 12 more cities by Dec.
31, when Price hopes a half million copies will be distributed
every day.
   Advertisers have been told The National will start printing a
second edition this week with a deadline three hours earlier than
normal so papers can be distributed the next morning on newsstands
further away from the centers of its three markets.
   Price confirmed that he hopes to soon begin printing about
75,000 copies a day of the ``twilight edition'' and to increase the
regular edition by 25,000 copies, boosting total distribution to
350,000.
   The twilight edition will enable The National to be available
for the morning rush hours in places like eastern Long Island,
Atlantic City, N.J., Milwaukee, Springfield, Ill., and Santa
Barbara, Calif., Price said.
   Media analysts say circulation confirmation from independent
auditing agencies is not yet available, leaving advertisers to rely
on the paper's word and anecdotal evidence of how things have been
going.
   ``They tell us they are meeting or exceeding their circulation
guarantees,'' said Andrew White, a spokesman for Philip Morris
Inc., which advertises Marlboro and Parliament cigarettes in The
National.
   White said Philip Morris still wants to see if the paper is a
truly national publication and whether circulation falls off on
certain days of the week.
   Richard Mader, president of Mader News, a newspaper distributor
in Culver City, Calif., said, ``I was originally skeptical that
people were going to buy it six days a week.''
   ``But the numbers are consistent through the week. There is just
a shift to different places on weekends,'' he said.
   Skeptics argued before The National's launch that people already
get enough sports information from their local newspapers and would
soon give up trying to wade through a 40- to 48-page sports daily.
   ``The jury is still out on readership,'' said Joseph Ostrow,
worldwide media director for the advertising agency Foote Cone
Belding Communications.
   The amount of advertising in the newspaper has been fairly
light, dropping off from double-digits in the first week to an
average of four to five pages a day recently. But Price said that
too was expected.
   The paper has had some early editorial gaffes. A cover photo
from a college basketball game, for instance, misidentified one of
the key players; an item on the University of Miami's Bill Foster
was accompanied by a photo of a coach with the same name from
Northwestern. The wrong box scores have appeared with game stories.
   Price said a dozen copy editors were added to the staff when it
became evident there were too few to handle the late nights six
days a week.
   He is especially proud of the paper's coverage of the unexpected
defeat of heavyweight boxer Mike Tyson late on a Saturday night.
   One potential threat evaporated late Sunday night when baseball
owners and players agreed on a new four-year labor contract, ending
a 32-day spring training lockout and averting a strike that
threatened the season.
   Baseball has no widely followed college counterpart, unlike pro
football and basketball. Before the settlement, editor-in-chief
Frank Deford had said he didn't think readers would want regular
coverage of minor league or Japanese baseball as a replacement if
there were a major league strike.
   However, Price had said that if there were a strike the paper
could cut back to 32 pages, and insisted the lack of baseball would
not be life- threatening.
   What would kill The National? It remains unclear how much
backers of the paper, mainly the Mexican Publisher Emilio
Azcarraga, are willing to lose.
   Price is optimistic.
   ``We expected the launch would cost us $20-25 million and that
is what it has cost us. We are tracking our plan,'' he said.

   U.S. share prices were lower early today in the
wake of a steep decline in the Tokyo stock market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 16.67 points at
2,724.55 at 10 a.m. EST. Declining issues outstripped gains by
around 4 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 834 issues down,
236 up and 419 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 20.2 million shares.
   In Tokyo today, anxiety about a possible interest rate hike and
the Japanese yen's decline against the dollar sent the key index on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange plummeting to a 14-month low. The
nervousness spilled over to Wall Street this morning.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which fell
55.20 points on Friday, plunged 1,353.20 points, or 4.15 percent,
today. Its closing of 31,263.24 was the lowest since it closed at
31,170.38 on Jan. 20, 1989.
   The Nikkei's decline today was the third biggest single-day
decline for the index. It plunged 3,836.48, or 14.9 percent, on
Oct. 20, 1987, in the worldwide ``Black Monday'' stock market
crash, and 1,569.10 points, or 4.50 percent, on Feb. 26.
   In New York, the NYSE's composite index of all its listed common
stocks was down 0.93 at 186.99.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index had
fallen 0.73 to 363.45.
   On Friday, the Dow Jones average jumped 44.60 to 2,740.32, its
highest close since it stood at 2,760.67 on Jan. 11.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 on the
NYSE, with 891 up, 577 down and 478 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 222.52 million shares, up from 144.41
million in last Thursday's session.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index plunged more
than 1,300 points in massive selling Monday _ its third biggest
single-day fall ever _ and closed at a 14-month low.
   The dollar continued to rise against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which fell
55.20 points last Friday, plunged 1,353.20 points, or 4.15 percent,
on Monday. Its closing of 31,263.24 was the lowest since it closed
at 31,170.38 on Jan. 20, 1989.
   The only bigger single-day declines were 3,836.48 on Oct. 20,
1987, in the worldwide ``Black Monday'' stock market crash, and
1,569.10 points on Feb. 26 this year.
   In Monday's early trading, the index initially rose 105 points
as investors were encouraged by last Friday's gains on Wall Street,
dealers said.
   But this was followed by a sharp decline in late morning.
   ``The anxiety about the interest rate hike coupled with the weak
yen against the dollar are the main causes of today's fall,'' said
Ichitaro Watanabe, a dealer with Nikko Securities Co. ``The market
as a whole appears very pessimistic about the current situation and
I have heard that there was some panic selling.''
   He said a sharp fall in index future prices also triggered
massive selling on the spot market.
   Meanwhile, the dollar closed at 153.55 yen, up 1.05 yen from
last Friday's close of 152.50 yen. After opening at 152.48 yen, it
ranged between 152.35 and 153.80 yen.
   Currency dealers said the dollar rose against the yen even
though the American currency was sold against the West German mark
after conservatives' impressive showing Sunday in East Germany's
first free elections in 41 years.
   The conservative alliance led by the Christian Democrats, a
sister party of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union, won the biggest single bloc of seats. The East
German Christian Democrats favor speedy reunification of the German
states.
   Masaaki Tanahashi, a dealer with Mitsui Bank, said that apart
from the West German mark's strength against other major
currencies, support for the dollar against the yen ``still remains
firm.''
   But Tanahashi said some market players were waiting to see if
Japan's central bank, as speculated, would decide this week to
raise its official discount rate from the current 4.25 percent.
   Japanese media have speculated for weeks that the Bank of Japan
would raise its key lending rate, charged for loans to commercial
banks, by as much as one percentage point. This would affect other
domestic interest rates.

   Greyhound and its striking drivers
exchanged barbs after negotiations broke down when company
officials charged that union leaders failed to negotiate and were
``stepping up the violence.''
   Union leaders presented a new contract proposal in talks held in
Tucson on Saturday, but the company said it was unacceptable.
Negotiations broke off Sunday after only about an hour.
   A federal mediator said he is disappointed but not surprised
that the first negotiations in the 18-day-old Greyhound bus
drivers' strike quickly broke off.
   ``The issues remaining are serious and they are many, and it's
not unusual at this stage of negotiations for both sides to remain
very firm in their position,'' said Paul F. Stuckenschneider.
   Greyhound and union officials were less diplomatic.
   ``There is no way to reach an agreement with people who are
trying to break down the company through intimidation, violence and
terrorism,'' the company's executive vice president, Anthony
Lannie, said in a statement Sunday.
   ``They had nothing new for us today or yesterday while stepping
up the violence,'' Lannie said. ``There were a half-dozen new acts
of terrorism yesterday while we were in the meeting.''
   In Washington, Jeffrey Nelson, a spokesman for the Amalgamated
Council of Greyhound Local Unions, said Lannie's statement ``sounds
to me like the desperate words of a desperate man.
   ``We clearly condemn violence and anything we can do to
discourage our members we are doing so,'' Nelson said.
   Unions representing 6,300 drivers and an estimated 3,000 other
Greyhound workers walked out March 2 over wages, job security and
grievance procedures.
   Greyhound operates the only nationwide intercity bus service,
and the strike has stranded many smaller communities for which
buses are the only public transportation.
   The company said it has been operating roughly one-third of its
buses with replacement and non-striking drivers, with about 400
union drivers joining 1,000 permanent replacements on the job. The
union says fewer than 100 of its drivers have crossed the picket
lines.
   Greyhound officials said there have been at least 14 shooting
attacks on Greyhound buses, 46 bomb threats and numerous other
incidents of vandalism or threats during the walkout.
   One new report of strike-related violence involved a union vice
president accused of striking a driver in Fayetteville, N.C.
   Cumberland County, N.C., Magistrate Sam Mathis issued a warrant
Saturday for the arrest of Fred Ingram of Charlotte, N.C., accusing
him of assaulting Greyhound driver Stanley Harvey, 57, of
Jacksonville, Fla.
   Ingram, who is also president of a local in Charlotte, denied
striking anyone.
   Steve Scarpino, a Greyhound spokesman in Dallas, said other new
complaints involved harassment by pickets in Mobile, Ala., an
assault on a driver in Tulsa, Okla. and damaged buses in Tucson and
Phoenix.
   In an earlier incident, driver Edwin J. Ludwigsen, 46, of Spring
Lake, N.C., said he was struck on the he!e by a man. o
-Bgistratwissmou$a criminalp`ummo(s for William DaniYs,fghom
Greyhound said was a union member.
   In Florida on Sunday, the State Patbol arrested the drivers of
tree vehicles that surrounded a New York-to-Miami Greyhound bus on
Interstate 95 near Fort Pierce and forced it to slow down. No one
on the bus was hurt, Scarpino said.
   Union officials said their proposal involved a $40 million
three-year package that included modest pay increases of 4 percent
to 5 percent and the addition of new drivers to the pension plan.
   A union spokesman said the company has offered a plan that
included no guarantee of `ny pay hikes, but would have made raises
contingent on$increased profits and ridership.
   Lannie said the union is ``stonewalling'' on contract talks.
   But union President Edward M. Strait said Greyhound never came
to the bargaining table in good faith, and ``refused to make an}
compromises, any concessions, from their previous unacceptable
proposals.''
   Stuckenschneider said he was not giving up on the negotiations.
   ``We hoped to have stayed longer, but we're not discouraged,''
he said. ``We hope to be back very soon.''

<HEAD>Massachusetts' Bond Rating Lowest In Nation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Another Wall Street credit-rating firm gave
Massachusetts the lowest bond rating in the nation today, a move
that could make borrowing more expensive for the state.
   Moody's Investors Service Inc. said the lowered rating reflects
Massachusetts' continued inaction in dealing with its fiscal crisis.
   The rating on its bonds was dropped to Baa from Baa1, although
it is still considered investment grade.
   Standard &amp; Poors Corp., another rating firm, had placed
Massachusetts below every other state in the nation last year. S&amp;P
re-affirmed its BBB rating last week.
   Bond ratings give investors a quick reference to determine the
degree of risk on an investment. The lower the rating, the higher
the risk involved.
   A low bond rating means the state may have to pay higher
interest rates on the money it borrows.
   Today's announcment coincides with the state's plans to go to
market with $360 million in long-term bonds for capital projects
sometime this week.
   George Leung, a Moody's analyst, noted the state's 1990 deficit
has grown from an original estimate of $500 million to more than
$700 million.
   ``Extended inaction this fiscal year has reduced confidence that
responsible action will be taken to contain this problem,'' Leung
said in a statement.
   Leung also noted that the state's economy has softened. In
addition to slowed revenues in fiscal 1990, the state's
unemployment rate recently rose to the national average of 5.3
percent in February.

   U.S. share prices were sharply lower early today
in the wake of a steep decline in the Tokyo stock market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 27.71 points at
2,713.51 at 11 a.m. EST. Declining issues outstripped gains by
around 3 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 927 issues down,
354 up and 439 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 42.6 million shares.
   Analysts said the market was unimpressed by news that UAL
Corp.'s unions and biggest shareholder have mounted a joint effort
to install new directors in a shareholder proxy fight and buy the
airline company for more than $3.8 billion, or more than $175 a
share.
   Five months ago, the collapse of a debt-financed offer for UAL,
parent of United Airlines, touched off a major tumble in the stock
market and raised the first big doubts about the future of the
corporate takeover craze of the 1980s.
   The Dow average plunged 190 points last Oct. 13, the day the
$300-a-share offer collapsed.
   Today's announcement on UAL by shareholder Coniston Partners and
the company's unions ``was not a turn-on'' for the market, said
Larry Wachtel, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``The UAL bid is kind of a promise to make a promise to make a
promise,'' he said.
   UAL stock was trading at $151 a share, up $8.50 from Friday's
close.
   In Tokyo today, anxiety about a possible interest rate hike and
the Japanese yen's decline against the dollar sent the key index on

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Slip On Brazilian Reforms; Grains Advance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices were slightly lower today
on the Chicago Board of Trade, largely in reaction to Brazilian
economic reform plans. Grain futures were mostly higher.
   The early decline in the soybean market reflected concerns that
Brazilian soybean growers will market their newly harvested crops
more aggressively as a result of the economic reforms announced
last week by Brazil's new president, Fernando Collor de Mello.
   The package includes a new Brazilian currency with free-floating
foreign exchange rates, which some analysts believe could encourage
soybean marketings in the world's second-largest soybean-producing
nation.
   Wheat futures were stronger in early trading, led by the March
contract amid indications of tighter-than-expected near-term
supplies. March grain and soybean contracts expire on Wednesday.
   Corn futures were higher in sympathy with wheat while oat
futures were narrowly mixed.
   In early trading, wheat futures prices were 1\ cents to 4\ cents
higher with the contract for delivery in March at $3.93} a bushel;
corn futures were { cent to 1{ cents higher with March at $2.49\ a

   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle futures were .25 cent to .48 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in April at 77.95 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .28 cent to .47 cent higher with March at 83 cents a

at 53.57 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.15 cents to 1.53
cents higher with May at 52.50 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on Friday.

   The number of working U.S. oil and gas rigs
declined by 15 this week as it continued on its normal first
quarter pace to total 908, Baker Hughes Inc. reported Monday.
   The decrease in rig activity conforms to previous first quarters
when the count generally is in a decline, according to Ike Kerridge
Jr., an economist for Baker Hughes.
   The year-to-date count, however, remains well ahead of the 1989
tally when 740 rigs were working, Baker Hughes said.
   Last week, the count rose by 29 to total 923 with Texas heading
other oil producing states with a gain of 30.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rotary rigs actively
exploring for oil and gas as of last Friday, not the number of
producing wells.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   This week, Texas saw the largest decline with 15 followed by
Oklahoma, 11; Louisiana, two, and New Mexico, Ohio and
Pennsylvania, one each.
   Kansas had the largest increase with six, California and Wyoming
had five each, and North Dakota, one. Colorado and Michigan were
unchanged from last week.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which continues to
sell its securities portfolio as it winds down business, has sold
its 3.9 percent stake in RJR Nabisco Inc. to Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co.
   Ruth Pachman, a spokeswoman for Kohlberg Kravis, said the
leveraged buyout firm paid nearly $51 million for the stake.
Kohlberg Kravis now holds 58 percent of the food and tobacco
company's stock.
   Drexel was the adviser and lead underwriter for Kohlberg Kravis'
$24.53 billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco last year.
   The investment firm acquired the RJR Nabisco stock in the course
of underwriting $5 billion in bond sales to finance the buyout.
   Drexel has been liquidating its securities portfolio since its
parent, Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection last month.

parent of United Airlines, touched off a major tumble in the stock
market and raised the first big doubts about the future of the
corporate takeover craze of the 1980s.
   The Dow average plunged 190 points last Oct. 13, the day the
$300-a-share offer collapsed.
   Today's announcement on UAL by shareholder Coniston Partners and
the company's unions ``was not a turn-on'' for the market, said
Larry Wachtel, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``The UAL bid is kind of a promise to make a promise to make a
promise,'' he said.
   UAL stock was trading at $149.75 a share, up $7.25 from Friday's
close.
   In Tokyo today, anxiety about a possible interest rate hike and
the Japanese yen's decline against the dollar sent the key index on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange plummeting to a 14-month low. The
nervousness spilled over to Wall Street this morning.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which fell
55.20 points on Friday, plunged 1,353.20 points, or 4.15 percent,
today. Its closing of 31,263.24 was the lowest since it closed at
31,170.38 on Jan. 20, 1989.
   The Nikkei's decline today was the third biggest single-day
decline for the index. It plunged 3,836.48, or 14.9 percent, on
Oct. 20, 1987, in the worldwide ``Black Monday'' stock market
crash, and 1,569.10 points, or 4.50 percent, on Feb. 26.
   In New York, the NYSE's composite index of all its listed common
stocks was down 1.14 at 186.78.

<HEAD>Is A House A Home?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Are Americans buying houses at the expense of
their homes?
   The question is not as foolish as it might seem, especially if
you accept the definition of a house as a mere physical structure
and a home as a spiritual haven and family environment.
   Pressured by prices that take a bigger chunk of paychecks than
they used to, both husband and wife must work to finance the house,
leaving too little time to develop the house as a home.
   The consequences aren't limited to the immediate family, but are
showing up as increased demands on employers and their benefits
structure.
   Some businesses say the situation results in more absences and
in stress-related illnesses; although definitive statistical
evidence has yet to be developed, the suspicion is that health
insurance costs are being driven up.
   Businesses in areas where good employees are hard to find are
either installing or contemplating day-care facilities. Maternal
leave time is a standard paragraph in employment contracts.
Paternal leave time is growing.
   In turn, critics of parental leave say it is an important factor
in the slow growth of productivity in the American workplace. They
are preparing to counter what seems to be growing sentiment in
Congress to make it mandatory.
   The National Federation of Indpendent Business, for example,
claims that mandated parental or maternity leave will prove too
expensive for smaller companies and may discourage them from hiring
potential parents.
   Whatever the problems or potential problems, housing and real
estate people suggest they arise from the fact that houses today
often are priced so high that it takes the financial capability of
both spouses.
   Citing a study by the Chicago Title and Trust Co., which
provides title insurance on houses, the National Association of
Realtors says the great majority of buyers last year were
two-income families.
   The Chicago study indicated that 79.3 percent of all couples
buying houses last year relied on two incomes. Among first-time
buyers the percentage was 86.8 percent, and even among repeat
buyers it was nearly 75 percent.
   The impact on family life is bound to be the of subject of
growing study and controversy.
   For one thing, various other studies suggest that even today's
so-called liberated women often are unable to reduce their load of
household chores because men have not been sharing them. That is,
women go to work and come home to work.
   The consequences raise various possibilities, among them that
the effect will be felt in the emotional and phsyical health of
children, and in the quality of marital relationships.
   Business is watching the situation carefully, fearful that
Congress will force parental leave into the cafeteria of employee
benefits. The National Federation says it would make employees wary
of hiring young married women.
   Just as important is the impact dual employment might be having
on health care costs. Business in general is trying to reduce its
benefits bill, partly by shifting more of the cost to the employees.
   But while business worries, it is conceivable that the more
serious cost to society might have less to do with business and
more to do with the home.

   Prices finished broadly lower in a particularly
sluggish session on London's Stock Exchange Monday, with investors
sidelined before the government's budget statement on Tuesday.
   A sharp fall earlier in Tokyo and weakness on Wall Street during
the European afternoon also depressed the market, dealers said.
   Sterling's weakness against the West German mark did not help,
they said.
   Investors were hesitant to take new positions, and there was
little corporate news to pull share prices out of the decline.

<TEXT>
   In the late 1980s, Columbia Savings
and Loan television ads showed a man in a suit standing high atop a
graph. Lines on the chart zigzagged up to demonstrate the company's
growth and strength.
   ``I'd say things are headed in the right direction,'' the
pitchman said.
   If the ads ran now, the guy might have to stand in a junkyard _
a metaphor not only for Columbia, but also for other California
S&amp;Ls that diversified away from home-mortgage lending during the
deregulated frenzy of the last decade.
   A third of the state's 21 biggest thrifts are in danger of
failing, even in a state economy that is one of the largest and
healthiest in the world.
   Why are so many California thrifts sick?
   A big reason is bad investments made under deregulation.
   Columbia's years of success, for example, were built on
investments in junk bonds, securities that paid high interest
because they funded risky ventures. Many were sold by Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.'s junk bond purveyor Michael Milken to his
friend and ally, Columbia Chairman Thomas Spiegel.
   Columbia's heap of junk, far bigger than any other thrift's, has
fallen in value by at least $800 million. Because of that, the S&amp;L
no longer meets federal standards for capital reserves _ its cash
cushion against risk.
   Spiegel has resigned. Drexel is in bankruptcy court. Milken is
indicted. The market for the risky securities he helped pioneer has
collapsed.
   Columbia's new president, Edward Harshfield, is trying to sell
the whole $3.5 billion junk bond package. Many observers don't
think he can.
   ``I just have a feeling Columbia may be too far gone,'' said
Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va.-based financial industry consultant.
   The No. 2 junk bond investor, San Diego's Imperial Savings and
Loan, was seized Feb. 23, the same day regulators took over
Huntington Beach-based Mercury Savings. Mercury had many problems,
but fell into insolvency partly because of another bugbear for
California thrifts _ a risky out-of-state loan.
   The number of thrifts in California boomed in the early 1980s
after federal and state laws were loosened, permitting S&amp;Ls to make
a range of investments. Unlike banks, they originally had been
allowed only to make loans for houses.
   California has about 12 percent of the country's population, but
29 percent of the S&amp;L assets.
   The state hasn't suffered the economic shocks of Texas and other
energy states, which could partly blame the skidding oil business
for their S&amp;L problems, or Arizona, where thrifts were buried when
real estate prices slumped.
   Analysts, regulators and industry officials instead blame shoddy
managers who courted big depositors with high interest rates and
made ill-conceived investments well beyond the Golden State's
borders. Besides junk bonds, California thrifts put money into duds
ranging from stud horses to Yugo cars.
   Honcho thrift entrepreneurs with little experience used their
newfound license to write not just adjustable rate loans, but
commercial and industrial loans, loans on vacant land, ``all that
goofy stuff,'' California S&amp;L Commissioner William Crawford said.
   Making matters worse, many conservative lenders followed suit,
often trying to recoup losses from early fixed-rate mortgage loans
made at low rates. ``A lot of the good monkeys copied the bad
monkeys,'' Crawford said.
   Crawford and Marion Sandler, president of World Savings and Loan
Association, said trying to do business outside the state was the
biggest problem.
   ``First, you don't know the territory, and second you're the
latest pigeon,'' she said.
   Many California thrift managers wrongly assumed every market was
as good as California, said Alex Sheshunoff, the head of an Austin,
Texas-based firm that tracks the thrift industry.
   ``They thought they had geographical risk diversification,''
Sheshunoff said. ``What they wound up with was a piece of every bad
deal no matter where it was.''
   Some of the more prominent thrifts that ventured out-of-state
include Great American Savings Bank of San Diego, now seeking an
investor or buyer after losing $124 million in 1989, largely
because of commercial lending in Arizona.
   Great Western's 1989 profits fell 60 percent because of a $200
million reserve for losses on commercial real-estate loans, most of
them outside California. The company is regarded as healthy
nonetheless.
   Irvine-based Lincoln Savings, the notorious thrift that
regulators say will cost $2 billion to bail out, lost money on
Arizona real estate and junk bonds. It is the biggest S&amp;L collapse
so far.
   Mercury said a soured loan on a hotel in Tulsa, Okla., helped
push it into insolvency. With assets of $2.16 billion, it had a
negative net worth of $33 million when seized.
   San Diego's Imperial had assets of $9.7 billion and a negative
net worth of $60 million when regulators seized it. Besides big
junk bond holdings, Imperial's problems included shaky car loans
and backing the importer of the Yugo, a car U.S. drivers shunned.
   Ely attributes many of the problems to simply too many S&amp;Ls with
too few solid franchises.
   ``There's parallels to the steel industry,'' said Ely. ``What
we're doing is trimming away obsolescence. ... It's the same trend
you see in any mature industry.''

<HEAD>Unions Team with Biggest Shareholder To Replace Directors, Buy

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp.'s unions and biggest shareholder today
announced a joint effort to replace directors of the airline
company and buy it for more than $3.8 billion.
   The offer, which included a no-strike commitment, shattered a
lull in the prolonged takeover maneuvering for the parent of United
Airlines and was about 40 percent less than a debt-financed deal
that collapsed five months ago.
   That collapse touched off a major tumble in the stock market and
raised the first big doubts about the future of the corporate
takeover craze of the 1980s.
   Coniston Partners, a New York takeover firm that has invested in
UAL and long demanded changes to boost the stock price, disclosed
details of the joint plan with the pilots, machinists and flight
attendants unions of the Chicago-based airline, the second largest
in the country behind American Airlines.
   It said they plan to lobby for shareholder proxy votes in favor
of electing a new slate of directors at the UAL April 26 meeting,
and the directors will attempt to force the company to agree to the
takeover proposal.
   Stockholders will receive $150 in cash and $25 in securities, as
well as non-voting common stock amounting to 25 percent of the
total in the company, the proposal stated. The unions would own the
remaining 75 percent.
   Based on UAL's 21.8 million shares outstanding, the offer would
be worth about $3.8 billion.
   UAL was trading at about $142.50 a share on the New York Stock
Exchange before the announcement, then shot up to $150 by midday.
The shares have traded as low as $121.
   Stephen M. Wolf, chairman of the company, said in a statement
that the board of directors was prepared to consider the
Coniston-union proposal and would meet promptly to discuss it as
well as other unspecified alternatives.
   It was unclear how Coniston and the unions intended to finance
the takeover. But their announcement said new labor agreements
would be negotiated that would include no-strike commitments and
``result in substantial labor cost savings.''
   The collapse of a debt-financed $300-a-share offer for UAL on
Oct. 13 is considered one of the major events in the era of
corporate takeovers because it instilled deep skepticism about
whether such deals would continue. The Dow Jones industrial average
plunged 190 points that day.
   The subsequent collapse of the junk-bond market practically
stopped all takeover deals because it eliminated the major source
of financing. Takeovers for airlines in particular are now
considered riskier because of uncertainty about the economy and the
overall health of the airline industry.
   UAL has attracted widespread interest because the unions have
been leading an effort to take control and play a crucial role in
any takeover's chances of success. The machinists balked at the
original takeover proposal and contributed to its downfall.

<HEAD>Holmes a Court Buys 4.18 Percent of Lloyd Webber's Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The entertainment company Really Useful Group PLC
confirmed Monday that Australian investor Robert Holmes a Court had
purchased a 4.18 percent stake, threatening British composer Andrew
Lloyd Webbers' plan to take the company private.
   The stake was acquired by Holmes a Court's Heytesbury (U.K.)
Ltd. last week, Really Useful said.
   Webber, who is a director of the companmy, is offering 233
pence, or $3.75, a share, for the company's stock. He already
contols 82.5 percent of its 33.2 million shares. The bid values the
entire company at 77.4 million pounds, or $125 million.
   Webber has said he wants to be free to switch his attention from
musicals to movies without worrying about how that would affect the
company's stock price.
   The company's principal activity is to develop and exploit the
copyrights it owns in Webber's musicals, including ``Phantom of the
Opera'' and ``Cats.''
   If Holmes a Court acquires more than 5 percent of Really Useful,
Webber's plan would be blocked because, under British law, the
composer can force remaining shareholders to sell their shares to
him only if he gains control of more than 95 percent of the company.
   Holmes a Court controls a company that operates theaters, the
Stoll Moss Theaters Ltd.
   Among the shareholders accepting the composer's offer has been
British publisher Robert Maxwell, who held a 14.4 percent stake.

   The U.S. dollar was mixed against the major
currencies in Europe Monday as traders concentrated on the West
German mark.
   Gold prices rose by as much as $2 an ounce.
   Foreign exchange dealers said there was active buying of West
German marks after the support for conservative parties in Sunday's
general election in East Germany. They said a new East German
government, backed by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, is likely
to take quick steps toward monetary union, free-market reforms and
unification of Germany.
   However, the dollar gained against the Japanese yen because of
disappointment that Japan showed no sign of raising its interest
rates.
   The British pound declined on the eve of Tuesday's national
budget speech by Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major, who is not
expected to present measures that can revive Britain's economy.
   Large tax concessions would fuel inflation, which has been
running at 7.7 percent since November; 2.5 percent higher than the
average in the 12-nation European Economic Community.
   One British pound cost $1.6110 in London late Monday, cheaper
for buyers than Friday's late $1.6235.
   Other late rates for the dollar, compared with Friday's prices,
included: 1.6829 West German marks, down from 1.6945; 1.5085 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5080; 5.6895 French francs, down from 5.7245;
1.8970 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9077; 1,244.25 Italian lire,
down from 1,251.00; and 1.1836 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1802.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 153.55 Japanese yen, up
from 152.50. In London late Monday the dollar also closed at 153.55.
   Gold prices moved modestly higher as the dollar price eased.
Traders said gold was also helped by general support for metals as
stock market prices weakened, but no widespread demand for gold has
developed so far.
   The closing price of gold in London, the major market, was
$402.45 bid a troy ounce, up from $400.50. The Zurich closing bid
price was $402.50, up from $401.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $401.75 bid, up from
$399.75.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $5.13 a troy
ounce, unchanged from Friday.

   U.S. share prices were lower this afternoon but
recovering, in the wake of a steep decline in the Tokyo stock
market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 14.64 points at
2,726.58 at 2 p.m. EST. The blue-chip barometer had been down as
much as 28 points earlier in the day.
   Declining issues outstripped gains by around 9 to 5 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 896 issues down, 515 up and 483 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 90.75 million shares.
   Analysts said the market was unimpressed by news that UAL
Corp.'s unions and biggest shareholder have mounted a joint effort
to install new directors in a shareholder proxy fight and buy the
airline company for more than $3.8 billion, or more than $175 a
share.
   Five months ago, the collapse of a debt-financed offer for UAL,
parent of United Airlines, touched off a major tumble in the stock
market and raised the first big doubts about the future of the
corporate takeover craze of the 1980s.
   The Dow average plunged 190 points last Oct. 13, the day the

the company's unions ``was not a turn-on'' for the market, said
Larry Wachtel, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``The UAL bid is kind of a promise to make a promise to make a

   UAL stock was trading at $151 a share, up $8.50 from Friday's
close. AMR, parent of American Airlines and previously the target
of a takeover proposal by New York developer Donald Trump, was
benefitting from the runup. Its shares were up $1 at $66.25 in
active trading.
   In Tokyo today, anxiety about a possible interest rate hike and
the Japanese yen's decline against the dollar sent the key index on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange plummeting to a 14-month low. The
nervousness spilled over to Wall Street this morning.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which fell
55.20 points on Friday, plunged 1,353.20 points, or 4.15 percent,
today. Its closing of 31,263.24 was the lowest since it closed at
31,170.38 on Jan. 20, 1989.
   The Nikkei's decline today was the third biggest single-day
decline for the index. It plunged 3,836.48, or 14.9 percent, on
Oct. 20, 1987, in the worldwide ``Black Monday'' stock market
crash, and 1,569.10 points, or 4.50 percent, on Feb. 26.
   In New York, the NYSE's composite index of all its listed common

<HEAD>Thatcher's Economic Miracle Soured by Inflation, Interest Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government presents its budget Tuesday against
a background of inflation and high interest rates that are
threatening Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's prospects for
re-election.
   Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major is not expected to
produce any radical changes in his speech to Parliament outlining
the fiscal year ending March 1991. But he is expected to try and
boost confidence in his existing tight monetary policy, which has
squeezed consumers and raised fears of recession.
   Base interest rates have risen to 15 percent, sending home loan
costs soaring, while an unpopular new property tax that takes
effect next month will raise many homeowners' bills by a third.
   Inflation is 7.7 percent, already the highest among the major
industrialized nations, and is forecast to rise to 9 percent. The
pound has weakened and the nation's 1989 trade deficit was $34
billion.
   A tight budget likely will worsen Mrs. Thatcher's standing,
while economists fear it won't be tight enough to wring out
stubborn inflation. Raising taxes would curb consumers' ability to
spend.
   ``My view is that we need a very tight budget indeed,'' said
Keith Skeoch, chief economist at the London investment firm James
Capel and Co.
   The spring budget statement outlines the government's revenue
raising plans and is a principal platform for announcing economic
policies and forecasts.
   The government details its spending plans in an autumn
statement. Last November, Major said spending would reach 179
billion pounds, the equivalent of $288 billion, in the coming year.
   Critics say the economy overheated because of the 1988 tax cuts,
devised by then-chancellor Nigel Lawson. Lawson eliminated four of
six tax brackets, cutting the basic rate from 27 percent to 25
percent and the top rate from 60 percent to 40 percent.
   The cuts partly were aimed at preventing a recession after the
1987 global stock market crash. But since then, the government has
pushed up interest rates 11 times to double their decade-low 7.5
percent of June 1988.
   The hikes are intended to curb inflation, which has more than
doubled to 7.7 percent since January 1988.
   There are fears that high interest rates might topple Britain
into a recession after eight straight years of economic growth.
Major says Britain's economic growth should slow to 1.25 percent
from 2 percent last year.
   These are setbacks for the Conservative government which took
credit for curing the ``British disease'' of high interest rates
and inflation.
   Now, Mrs. Thatcher, who must call an election by mid-1992, faces
doubts about her economic stewardship.
   The strategy ``has patently failed to work. We've gone to a
situation where a recession is almost necessary to slow
inflation,'' Skeoch said.
   Gavyn Davies, a British economist with Goldman Sachs
International, said, ``I think it's working, yes...
   ``But it no longer looks like a Thatcher economic miracle.''
   Just last week, the government reported that retail sales rose
2.4 percent in February to an all-time high of $15 billion, despite
the higher interest rates.
   Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition Labor Party, claimed Mrs.
Thatcher's policies ``are failing to manage demand, they are
increasing inflation, they are decreasing manufacturing investment
and they are clobbering every homebuyer in the country because of
mortgage rates.''
   But the government said such economic figures can be erratic,
that the retail sales growth was slower than last year's 4 percent,
and that economic indicators point to a slowdown.
   Mrs. Thatcher told Parliament the high interest rates are
working _ but declined to give assurances that they won't go any
higher.
   Pessimists fear the government again will raise interest rates
to prop up the pound, whose fall is worsening inflation prospects.
Sterling is trading at about $1.61, compared with $1.87 in December
1988.
   The foreign exchange and stock markets have been jittery over
the economy, Mrs. Thatcher's declining popularity in opinion polls
and violent protests against the new property tax.
   However, there are bright spots. Unemployment has fallen to 5.6
percent in February from a peak of 11.5 percent in June 1986. The
government has a budget surplus of $15.5 billion for the first 11
months of its current fiscal year. The strikes that plagued British
industry in the 1970s virtually have disappeared.
   Former Conservative Party Chairman Norman Tebbit told reporters
last week that interest rates almost certainly will fall by the end
of 1990, because the government will have to ease the pressure as
the next election approaches.

   Hudson, 44, was elected president and chief operating officer of
U.S. Shoe earlier this year.
   U.S. Shoe, which has about 45,000 employees, reported sales last

   ``The basic goals of U.S. Shoe will remain much the same as they

<HEAD>Soybeans Surge On Fund Buying; Grains Rally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed sharply higher
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid heavy buying by
speculative funds. Grain futures also advanced, reflecting
tightness in near-term wheat supplies.
   The soybean market opened lower on expectations that sweeping
economic reforms announced last week in Brazil, the world's
second-largest soybean producer, would stimulate farmer sales of
soybeans there.
   But analysts saw no significant increase in Brazilian sales over
the weekend or on Monday, said Steve Freed, a grain-market analyst
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Meanwhile, analysts said Memphis-based Sparks Commodities Inc.
released an estimate of the Brazilian soybean crop pegging
production at 19.5 million metric tons instead of the 20.5 million
that many analysts had been using in their projections.
   The lower estimate sparked new buying, which boosted prices in
afternoon trading.
   At the close, wheat futures were 2{ cents to 9\ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in March at $3.98} a bushel; corn
was 3 cents to 3{ cents higher with March at $2.51 a bushel; oats
were 1} cents to 2{ cents higher with March at $1.48{ a bushel;
soybeans were 6 cents to 8{ cents higher with March at $5.90 a

   U.S. shares rebounded in afternoon trading
today, shrugging off a steep decline in the Tokyo stock market to
extend their recent advance.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 2.48 points at
2,738.74 at 3 p.m. EST. The blue-chip barometer had been down as
much as 28 points earlier in the day.
   Declining issues edged out gains by around 4 to 3 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 814 issues down, 595 up and 525 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 112.13 million shares.
   Analysts said the market was buoyed by positive sentiment
despite the slide in Tokyo today.
   Anxiety about a possible interest rate hike and the Japanese
yen's decline against the dollar sent the key index on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange plummeting to a 14-month low. The nervousness
spilled over to Wall Street this morning but later eased.
   ``The upside momentum is not spent yet,'' Alfred Goldman, a vice
president at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis, Mo. ``This up
leg is not over yet.''
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which fell
55.20 points on Friday, plunged 1,353.20 points, or 4.15 percent,
today. Its closing of 31,263.24 was the lowest since it closed at
31,170.38 on Jan. 20, 1989.
   The Nikkei's decline today was the third biggest single-day
decline for the index. It plunged 3,836.48, or 14.9 percent, on
Oct. 20, 1987, in the worldwide ``Black Monday'' stock market
crash, and 1,569.10 points, or 4.50 percent, on Feb. 26.
   Analysts said some stocks in New York were helped by news that
UAL Corp.'s unions and biggest shareholder have mounted a joint
effort to install new directors in a shareholder proxy fight and
buy the airline company for more than $3.8 billion, or more than
$175 a share.
   Five months ago, the collapse of a debt-financed offer for UAL,
parent of United Airlines, touched off a major tumble in the stock
market and raised the first big doubts about the future of the
corporate takeover craze of the 1980s.
   The Dow average plunged 190 points last Oct. 13, the day the
$300-a-share offer collapsed.
   UAL stock was trading at 151} a share, up 9\ from Friday's
close. AMR, parent of American Airlines and previously the target
of a takeover proposal by New York developer Donald Trump, was
benefitting from the runup. Its shares were up 1&lsqb; at 66&rsqb; in active
trading.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 0.08 at 187.84.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index had
fallen 0.76 to 363.42.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, IBM was down \ at

<HEAD>Command Says Talks Off on Selling Three Texas Radio Properties</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 2 new grafs with additional details.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Command Communications Inc. said Monday talks
have ended on previously announced plans to sell radio stations in
Houston and Dallas and a Texas-wide radio network for $86.5 million
to Evergreen Media Corp.
   Command said the decision reflects ``the continued strong
performance of the properties and the brightening prospects for the
Texas economy.''
   The New York-based company said it had ``secured additional
sources'' of both equity and bank financing and now plans to make
acquisitions in Texas and other markets.
   Scott K. Ginsburg, president and chief executive of Evergreen
Media, of Irving, Texas, said he was disappointed that Command and
its principals ``have had a change of heart about this
transaction.''
   Command signed an agreement in January to sell KRLD-AM of Dallas
and The Texas State Radio Networks to Evergreen Media for $58.5
million.
   Under a separate deal, Evergreen would have acquired KODA-FM in
Houston for $28 million from The Sillerman Companies, a New
York-based investor in Command and other broadcast properties.
   At that time, Command's president and chief executive, Carl C.
Brazell Jr., said in a news release that the purchase price ``gives
us an opportunity to increase shareholder value.''
   Ginsburg had said in January the deal would give Evergreen,
which owns an FM radio station in Dallas and five stations in four
other cities, a dominant position in Dallas while moving it further
along on its strategic growth plan.
   But in announcing Monday that the negotiations had ended,
Brazell was quoted as saying, ``In the final analysis, we just
couldn't part with such a strong regional franchise.''
   In a separate news release, Ginsburg said the January agreement
called for Evergreen to finance the $28 million KODA purchase while
Command was to put in place $58.5 million in assumable debt related
to the other transaction.
   Both companies were to contribute working capital to the
KRLD-Texas State Radio Networks entity, Ginsburg said.
   He said Evergreen received financial commitments from lenders
and investors for the KODA purchase, but was unable to receive
assurances of Command's ability to secure the required assumable
debt related to the purchase of the Houston station and the radio
networks.
   ``Be it financing problems or a new business agenda for Command
Communications, it's now apparent that it will not be possible for
Evergreen Media to proceed with these tranasctions,'' Ginsburg said.
   KRLD-AM is an all-news station, KODA-FM has a soft adult
contemporary format and The Texas State Radio Networks provides
agribusiness and Spanish-language programming and Dallas Cowboys
football for stations across Texas.
   Brazell and Robert F.X. Sillerman formed Command Communications
in late 1988.
   In a telephone interview, Sillerman said it had become more
difficult to finance the transaction over the past six months,
while at the same time media prices have fallen. ``As a result, we
are more interested in acquiring than selling,'' he said.
   He said The Sillerman Companies last week transferred its right
to buy KODA for $28 million to Command. In addition to the two
Texas radio stations and the radio networks, Sillerman said Command
owns KJQY-FM radio in San Diego.

   U.S. shares rebounded in a vigorous afternoon

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Petroleum Co. PLC said Monday it was
cutting 1,150 jobs, or nearly half the staff, at its London
headquarters as part of a reorganization designed to lower costs
and make the oil giant more flexible.
   About 900 people will be laid off and the rest will be
transferred, said a spokesman, who was not identified in accordance
with British practice.
   The cuts, mainly affecting staff running administrative,
computing and information services, represent a 46 percent
reduction in the 2,500 staff currently employed at the company's
headquarters. BP employs 118,000 people worldwide.
   The job cuts are part of BP's ``Project 1990'' to reduce the
organization's complexity and cut expenses, BP said.
   BP Chairman Robert Horton said: ``As we enter the 1990s we
expect the pace of change in global business to quicken. ...
Corporations which achieve the greatest success will be those which
are prepared and able to respond rapidly, flexibly and
imaginatively.''
   The company said it is simplifying management by removing layers
of managers, replacing departments with flexible teams, reducing
the number of boards and committees, and contracting out certain
services.
   The announcement follows a reduction of 1,700 jobs, or 17
percent, in BP's exploration and production activities worldwide in
1989.

   The dollar turned in a mixed performance against
other major currencies Monday in trading dominated by the West
German mark.
   Gold prices posted minor gains in domestic and overseas dealings.
   Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of $400.80 for a
troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EST, up 80 cents from Friday's late
bid. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for March delivery
settled at $400.70 a troy ounce, $1.10 higher than Friday.
   Currency dealers said the support for conservative parties in
Sunday's general election in East Germany sparked interest in
buying West German marks.
   The new East German government, backed by West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, was considered likely to take quick steps toward
monetary union, free-market reforms and unification of Germany.
   As trading ended in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6860
West German marks, down from 1.6980 marks Friday.
   The dollar gained against the Japanese yen, however, as dealers
grew impatient waiting for the Tokyo government to raise the
country's key interest rates, which has been expected for weeks. A
Japanese news report late in U.S. trading saying increases could be
enacted Tuesday failed to have much impact.
   Confidence in the yen also was shaken by the stock selloff in
Tokyo, which knocked 4.15 percent off the Nikkei Stock Average's
value.
   One dollar bought 153.05 Japanese yen late in New York, more
than the 152.65 yen late on Friday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar
closed at 153.55 Japanese yen, up from 152.50. In London late
Monday the dollar also closed at 153.55.
   The British pound declined on the eve of Tuesday's national
budget speech by Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major, who is not
expected to present measures that can revive Britain's economy.
Dealers reported the Bank of England sold dollars and bought
sterling to defend the pound's value.
   One British pound fetched $1.6135 late in New York, weaker than
$1.6190 on Friday. Earlier, in London, a pound cost $1.6110,
cheaper for buyers than Friday's late $1.6235.
   Zlatko Glamuzina, chief currency dealer at the Banco di Sicilia
in New York, said dollar trading was quiet and uneventful with most
of the buying and selling interest focused on the mark and the yen.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late quotes
Friday, included: 1.5085 Swiss francs, down from 1.5095; 5.7025
French francs, down from 5.7360; 1,246.75 Italian lire, down from
1,253.00; and 1.18225 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18285.
   Selected dollar rates late in Europe compared with Friday's

<HEAD>Eastern Airlines Announces First Class Fare Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines announced Monday it was cutting
first class fares by about 40 percent in an effort to attract more
business travelers and was sweetening travel agent commissions for
sales of the new, cut-rate tickets.
   The lower fares, called ``Y-Not fares,'' are good for domestic
travel through June 30, carry no penalties, are fully refundable
and can be booked up to flight time.
   ``With the Y-Not fare, you can buy them at anytime and fly at
anytime,'' said George Brennan, vice president of marketing for the
Miami-based carrier.
   Some industry analysts expressed surprise at the size of the
fare cuts, which put Eastern's first-class tickets about 15 percent
below the industry's full coach fares. But they said they did not
expect other carriers to immediately match or lower their rates.
   ``It's a marketing move, a promotional program,'' said Robert
Decker, analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago. ``We might see some
selective matching by other airlines but I wouldn't expect a
widespread move at this point.''
   Eastern is reorganizing under bankruptcy court protection from
creditors, where it sought protection following a crippling strike
by pilots, machinists and flight attendants a year ago.
   Decker said Eastern's success in emerging from bankruptcy
depends on getting business travelers back in significant numbers.
   ``They're trying to get the business traveler back on and fill
up the first class section which is probably flying empty right
now,'' Decker said.
   Eastern claims its 9,000 daily first-class seats are 65 percent
full, although Brennan conceded at a New York news conference that
many passengers now flying first class on Eastern are frequent
flier passengers upgraded from coach.
   Current industry first class fares between New York and Miami
are $437 one-way, while the lowest full-coach fare is $333,
according to figures supplied by Eastern. The new ``Y-Not'' fare on
that route is $276 one way _ $10 above Eastern's current full-coach
fare.
   Between Chicago and Atlanta, the current first-class, one-way
fare is $537, full-coach is $360 and Eastern's Y-Not fare is $298.
   Eastern passengers with full-coach fare tickets will be able to
exchange their tickets for first-class seats for $10 more.
Eastern's full-coach fares, the lowest in the industry, are $10
less than the ``Y-Not'' fares.
   Eastern said it expects the lower fares to generate about
$400,000 a day more in net revenue. The fares are good for travel
in the United States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
   Andrew Geller, analyst with Provident National Bank in
Philadelphia, said the increase in travel agent commissions will
help Eastern improve relations between the carrier and its travel
agents.
   Standard commissions industrywide amount to about 10 percent.
Eastern will boost the commissions on ``Y-Not'' tickets to 15
percent.
   Many agents have been wary of putting customers on Eastern
because of the carrier's financial problems.
   ``Some travel agents have not been booking on Eastern for fear
that in the future clients might get stranded,'' Geller said. ``By
doing this, it tries to get around that fear.''

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Climb As Brazil's Perceieved Output Drops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices rose sharply Monday on the
Chicago Board of Trade amid talk of lower-than-expected Brazilian
soybean yields and diminishing fears that Brazil's economic reforms
will lead to a flood of soybean marketings.
   On other commodity markets, coffee, sugar and cocoa futures fell
sharply; livestock and meat futures advanced; petroleum futures
were mixed; and precious metals were higher.
   Soybean futures settled 6 cents to 8\ cents higher with March at
$5.90 a bushel.
   The soybean market opened lower on expectations that sweeping
economic reforms announced last week in Brazil, the world's
second-largest soybean producer, would stimulate farmer sales of
soybeans there.
   Of greatest concern was a plan to replace Brazil's currency, the
cruzado novo, with a new currency, the cruzeiro, which would
feature free-floating foreign exchange rates. Many experts believe
the cruzeiro will be sharply devalued, which would prompt farmers
to sell soybeans to obtain dollars or other hard currency.
   But analysts saw no significant increase in Brazilian sales over
the weekend or on Monday, said Steve Freed, a grain market analyst
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Meanwhile, analysts said Memphis-based Sparks Commodities Inc.
released an estimate of the Brazilian soybean crop pegging
production at 19.5 million metric tons instead of the 20.5 million
projected last month by the U.S. Agriculture Department.
   Sparks would not confirm the number. But analysts said
indications of lower-than-expected Brazilian soybean yields _ the
harvest began about two weeks ago _ have prompted a great deal of
speculation that the crop will be smaller than the USDA's estimate.
   ``The smaller the Brazilian crop, the less it will compete with
our beans once we get into the new crop year'' at the beginning of
September, said Anne Frick, senior oilseeds analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Wheat futures settled were 2} cents to 9 cents higher with March
at $3.98{ a bushel; corn was 3 cents to 3} cents higher with March
at $2.51 a bushel; oats were 1} cents to 2{ cents higher with March
at $1.48{ a bushel.
   Selling linked to the Brazilian economic reforms dominated the
coffee, cocoa and sugar markets. Brazil is a major producer of all
three commodities.
   On New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange, coffee futures
finished 1.5 cents to 2.67 cents lower with March at 87 cents a
pound; sugar settled .02 cent to .26 cent lower with May at 15.87
cents a pound; cocoa futures settled $20 to $36 lower with March at
$1,095 a ton.
   Livestock and meat futures made strong gains on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, largely in reaction to Friday's monthly USDA
cattle-on-feed report, which showed more active feedlot marketings
than traders had expected.
   Live cattle futures settled .42 cent to .78 cent higher with
April at 78.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .23 cent to .37
cent higher with March at 82.95 cents a pound; live hogs were .10
cent lower to .30 cent higher with April at 53.72 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .82 cent to .90 cent higher with March at
51.45 cents a pound.
   Near-month crude-oil futures edged lower on the New York
Mercantile Exchange amid concerns about high OPEC production.
Gasoline futures also fell while heating oil firmed on indications
of tight near-term availability.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 47 cents lower to 5
cents higher with April at $19.60 a barrel; heating oil was .08
cent to .20 cent higher with April at 54.54 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .35 cent to .86 cent lower with April at
56.36 cents a gallon.
   Precious metal futures firmed slightly on New York's Commodity
Exchange.
   Gold settled $1 higher across the board wwith April at $401.90 a
troy ounce;
   Silver was 0.8 cent to 1 cent higher with March at $5.101 a troy
ounce.

   U.S. shares rebounded Monday in an impressive
afternoon rally, shrugging off a steep decline in the Tokyo stock
market to extend their recent advance.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finished 14.41 points
higher at 2,755.63, after hovering in negative territory most of
the day. The blue-chip barometer had been down as much as 28 points
earlier in the trading session.
   Advancing issues edged out declining ones in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 730 up, 700 down and
533 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 142.30 million
shares, down from 222.52 million in Friday's session.
   Analysts said Wall Street was buoyed by positive market
sentiment and continued strength in the dollar.
   The dollar continued to climb against the Japanese yen, as
dealers grew impatient waiting for the Tokyo government to raise
the country's key interest rates, a move which has been expected
for weeks. A Japanese news report late in U.S. trading said rate
increases could be made Tuesday.
   The U.S. currency was quoted late in New York at 153.05 yen, up
from 152.65 yen late Friday.
   In Japan Monday, anxiety about a possible interest rate hike and
the yen's decline against the dollar sent the key index on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange plummeting to a 14-month low.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which fell
55.20 points on Friday, plunged 1,353.20 points, or 4.15 percent,
Monday. Its closing of 31,263.24 was the lowest since it closed at
31,170.38 on Jan. 20, 1989. The nervousness spilled over to Wall
Street Monday morning but later eased.
   ``Once the selloff was over, the bullishness that was there for
the last few weeks continued to be reflected in the market,'' said
Rao Chalasani, an investment strategist at Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben
in Cleveland, Ohio.
   On Friday, the Dow Jones average jumped 44.60 to 2,740.32, its
highest close since it stood at 2,760.67 on Jan. 11.
   Analysts said some stocks in New York were helped Monday by news
that UAL Corp.'s unions and biggest shareholder have mounted a
joint effort to install new directors in a shareholder proxy fight
and buy the airline company for around $3.8 billion, or more than
$175 a share.
   Five months ago, the collapse of a debt-financed offer for UAL,
parent of United Airlines, touched off a major tumble in the stock
market and raised the first big doubts about the future of the
corporate takeover craze of the 1980s.
   The Dow average plunged 190 points last Oct. 13, the day the
$300-a-share offer collapsed.
   UAL stock closed Monday at 154{ a share, up 12 from Friday's
close.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 170.25 million shares.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, General Electric
jumped ~ to 64~, IBM was up &rsqb; at 109, Upjohn surged 1&rsqb; to 39,
Boeing advanced 1} to 71{ and Rorer rose 1\ to 67.
   Phillips Petroleum was down &rsqb; at 25\ and Norton slipped &lsqb; to 74}.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $11.67 billion, or 0.35
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.74 to 188.66.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index advanced 2.40 to 398.80, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index rose 1.62 to 343.53.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
0.75 to 442.91. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 364.12, down 0.06.

<HEAD>Takeover Investor, Unions In New Bid For UAL</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 10th graf with three grafs to UPDATE with closing stock
price and add quote from Coniston investor.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   UAL Corp.'s unions and biggest shareholder
announced a $3.8 billion buyout offer Monday for the airline
company, a mostly cash deal worth about 40 percent less than a
debt-financed effort that collapsed five months ago.
   UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf _ who helped lead last year's
ill-fated buyout deal _ issued a statement saying the board would
consider the offer, which shattered a lull in the maneuvering for
the parent of United Airlines.
   The outcome could help determine the shape of takeovers in the
tight-money atmosphere that has prevailed since the collapse of the
earlier $6.8 billion deal, which contributed to a plunge in the
stock market and raised some of the biggest doubts about the future
of the corporate merger craze of the 1980s.
   Airline analysts said financing for the new bid could be a
problem. The depression in the junk-bond market and demise of its
pioneer Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., formerly a leading source of
takeover financing, also could present major obstacles.
   Coniston Partners, a New York investment firm that owns 11.8
percent of UAL's approximately 21.8 million shares outstanding,
disclosed the plan with the United pilots, machinists and flight
attendants unions. United is the nation's second-largest airline
after American Airlines.
   Coniston said the group plans to lobby shareholders for their
proxy votes in favor of electing a new slate of directors at UAL's
annual meeting April 26.
   If they are successful, the new directors will push for
accepting the Coniston-union takeover, which will give UAL's
employees _ including nonunion workers _ 75 percent ownership of
the company.
   The plan would pay stockholders $150 in cash and $25 in
securities, plus non-voting common stock amounting to 25 percent of
the total in the company, for each of their shares.
   Based on UAL's 21.8 million shares outstanding, the offer would
be worth about $3.8 billion.
   UAL stock rose $12 to $154.50 a share Monday in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have recently traded as low
as $121.
   Keith Gollust, one of Coniston's three principal partners, said
in a telephone interview that they were undertaking the proxy fight
because UAL's board was moving too slowly on Coniston's
longstanding demand that the company be sold or restructured.
   ``Our decision to nominate a slate of directors in opposition to
the incumbents was based on our disappointment that the board was
unable to produce another transaction,'' he said.
   Wolf's statement said UAL's board would consider the offer
carefully and meet to discuss it along with unspecified
alternatives for raising the value of UAL shares. No meeting date
was announced.
   It was unclear how Coniston and the unions intended to finance
the takeover. They said the deal would include new labor
agreements, such as no-strike commitments, and ``result in
substantial labor cost savings.''
   Airline analyst Kevin Murphy of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. said the
group's ability to obtain financing was the key to their plan.
   ``It's going to be hard for them to win a proxy fight unless
they can show the shareholders they've got some financial clout,''
Murphy said.
   But Jack Hunter, an airlines analyst with Howe Barnes
Investments Inc., said UAL owns about 240 airplanes, more than half
of United's fleet, that could be used as collateral to secure a
large enough loan for the proposed deal. Hunter estimated the
planes are worth $4 billion.
   He predicted UAL's board would agree to a buyout and avoid a
proxy fight.
   ``I don't think there's going to be a war,'' Hunter said. ``I
think the board is ready to get out of this.''
   UAL has been in a takeover target since early last August, when
Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis offered $4.3 billion for the
company. The pilot-management coalition eventually won a deal with
its $300 a share, $6.8 billion offer.
   The Oct. 13 collapse of that offer, which was to be financed
largely with borrowed money, was considered one of the major events
in the era of corporate takeovers because it helped instill deep
skepticism about whether such deals would continue. The Dow Jones
industrial average plunged 190 points that day.
   The subsequent slump of the market for high-interest junk bonds
widely used to finance buyouts helped curb the takeover frenzy.
Airline acquisitions in particular have been considered risky
because of uncertainties about the economy and health of the
airline industry.
   In January, the three unions proposed an employee purchase of 75
percent of UAL and the board instructed its advisers to help the
unions put together a formal bid.
   The relationship soured when the union group indicated it
planned to dump Wolf. The chairman has taken a hard line in labor
negotiations and would have received $76 million in cash and a 10
percent stake in UAL as part of last year's failed bid.
   Coniston's buyout plan mirrors the firm's attack on UAL
predecessor Allegis Corp. in 1987. The firm acquired a stake in
Allegis and threatened to mount a takeover if the company did not
divest its non-airline businesses, which Coniston believed were
hindering corporate earnings and depressing the value of its
shareholdings.
   Allegis ended up selling its Hertz car rental, Westin Hotel Co.,
and Hilton International chains and renaming itself UAL.

<HEAD>Crude Oil, Gasoline Futures Drop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices ended mixed Monday in fairly
active trading, as crude oil and gasoline continued the downward
trend started last week.
   Crude oil pierced the $20 mark for the first time in more than
three months as sellers went on a binge early in the session,
analysts said. However, prices recovered from their lows shortly
after midday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the April contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the key grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 47 cents
to close at $19.60 a 42-gallon barrel after sinking to $19.44
earlier in the session.
   The near-term contract last closed under $20 on Nov. 30, when it
finished at $19.89.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for April delivery, which dropped
1.11 cents at one point during the session, ended 0.60 cent lower
at 56.36 cents a gallon.
   ``There's just too much gasoline around,'' said Kevin Breslin,
energy analyst with United Energy Inc. ``And most of what's out
there is premium, the kind everybody wants.''
   Meanwhile, the April contract for No. 2 heating oil rose .08
cent to 54.54 a gallon.
   ``There are a lot of factors affecting prices right now,
including the selling trend last week due to high stocks and low
demand and crude oil breaking through technical levels,'' said
Peter Beutel, energy broker and analyst with Elders Futures Inc.
   Analysts said demand for crude oil has fallen off sharply due
partly to annual refinery maintenance, when refineries slow
operations and therefore use less crude oil to make products.
   Observers also attributed some of the early sell-off to
OPEC-related jitters.
   ``The fact that OPEC didn't do anything was another factor but I
wouldn't put it at the top of the list,'' Beutel said.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' monitoring
committee concluded a two-day meeting on Saturday after reviewing
current market conditions in advance of the full OPEC ministerial
conference in May.
   As expected, the oil ministers adjourned without making any
formal decisions on production, despite the recent softening in
prices and predictions of a further seasonal erosion in consumption
during the second quarter.

<HEAD>Banks Taking Advantage Of Securities Loophole</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Large bank holding companies have moved
swiftly to take advantage of a loophole in the legal wall
separating banking from the securities industry, according to a
congressional report.
   Bank holding companies, under a regulation passed by the Federal
Reserve Board three years ago, started underwriting a limited
amount of some previously forbidden securities in the
July-September quarter of 1988.
   In that quarter, four companies underwrote $12.3 billion in
securities, the General Accounting Office said in a report to the
House Banking oversight subcommittee.
   By the July-September quarter of 1989, the latest period for
which data was available, 13 companies underwrote $68.7 billion, up
90 percent from the previous quarter and 460 percent from a year
earlier.
   Ninety-eight percent of the securities involved were commercial
paper, short-term debt issued by large publicly traded companies.
The figures also include municipal revenue bonds, mortgage-related
securities and other asset-backed securities.
   The GAO said the bank activity represented about 1.9 percent of
the combined markets in those securities.
   Another eight companies have gotten permission to receive
underwriting what are termed ineligible securities but had not
started yet. The Fed has also expanded the list of securities
covered by the loophole to include corporate debt and is expected
to soon approve the first bank underwriting of corporate stock.
   The GAO, Congress' auditing and investigative agency, said it
was too soon to draw any conclusions about the profitability or
riskiness of bank holding company affiliates involvement in
securities.
   So far, the Fed has limited the holding companies to deriving no
more than 10 percent of their revenue from ineligible securities.
That restriction is in place to comply with the 1933 Glass-Steagall
Act.
   The act separated commercial from investment banking in the wake
of abuses thought to contribute to a wave of bank failures that
followed the 1929 stock market crash.
   Next year, Congress is expected to reopen debate on whether and
how to permit banks to move more broadly into the securities
business.

<HEAD>Perkin-Elmer Sells Off Lithography Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORWALK, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Perkin-Elmer Corp. announced Monday it has
sold its electron beam unit to a group of former and current
managers backed by the investments of five other companies that
either buy the unit's products or supply it with technology.
   The Electron Beam Technology Division, of Hayward, Calif., was
sold to ETEC Inc., bringing together the leaders in the field of
electron beam lithography, said Horace G. McDonnell, chairman and
chief executive officer of Perkin-Elmer.
   Electron beam lithography involves etching patterns onto the
wafers used in computer technology. The unit makes the machines
that use the beam technology to imprint patterns.
   Perkin-Elmer has a second division that uses optical lithography
to write the patterns. The company has been trying to sell both
businesses as part of a restructuring announced last year, but it
reportedly has had trouble finding an American buyer for the
optical business.
   Reported interest last year by the Nikon Corp. of Japan raised
concerns about foreign companies gaining control of critical
technology.
   Recent reports identified Silicon Valley Group Inc. of San Jose,
Calif., as a possible buyer, but company spokesman Edward Bloch
declined to comment.
   No sale price was announced for the electron beam unit, which
employs 500 in California, Japan and Europe. It will be run by
former Perkin-Elmer officers Charles E. Minihan and Thomas
Halloran, with equity participation from International Business
Machines Corp., Micron Technology Inc., the Du Pont Co., the
Grumman Corp. and Zitel Corp.
   Perkin-Elmer said IBM is investing in its own beam technology,
said to have the most advanced capability in the world.
   The other businesses Perkin-Elmer has sold in the restructuring
are the Electro-Optics Division, which built NASA's powerful Hubble
space telescope, and a German aerospace unit.
   The units targeted for sale accounted for 40 percent of the
company's 1988 sales.

   H.J. Heinz Co. said Monday it is interested in
buying RJR Nabisco's A1 steak sauce and Grey Poupon mustard lines
but that no talks on a possible deal have occurred.
   Heinz is interested in the products although it already produces
barbecue sauce under its Heinz 57 label and also manufactures
mustard, said Ted Smyth, spokesman for the Pittsburgh-based food
maker.
   On Saturday, Smyth said RJR Nabisco and Heinz were discussing a
possible sale and that Heinz Chairman Anthony J. O'Reilly announced
the talks in a meeting with Wall Street analysts last week.
   However, Heinz issued a statement Monday saying the company was
not and had not been in talks about Grey Poupon and A1. But Smyth
said on Monday that the company was interested in those brands.
   The investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. paid $24.53
billion last year to take RJR Nabisco private in the largest
corporate takeover ever. The firm has been selling selected assets
to reduce its debt load.
   RJR Nabisco already has sold its Del Monte fresh fruit and
processed food businesses, some of its foreign operations and its
Baby Ruth and Butterfinger candy business.

   A federal bankruptcy judge on Monday approved
LTV Steel Co.'s tentative labor agreement with the United
Steelworkers of America, allowing the union to begin sending
ballots to 13,700 members.
   The ballots will be counted April 2 at USW headquarters in
Pittsburgh.
   The proposed three-year contract covers LTV employees at 13
plants in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, New York and
Minnesota, according to Gary Hubbard, union spokesman.
   If approved, it will take effect April 15.
   The agreement, approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton I.
Lifland in New York, restores past wage and benefit concessions,
including an average of $1.59 an hour in wages cuts and the
elimination of three holidays and one week of vacation.
   New wage increases average $1 an hour beginning Jan. 1, 1991 and
50 cents cents an hour beginning Jan. 1, 1992.
   Other provisions include:
   _A $500 immediate bonus and a $500 advance on 1990 profit
sharing.
   _A new profit-sharing plan that gives employees 10 percent of
company profits. The present plan was capped at the level of
employee concessions.
   _A program to help protect employees against cost-of-living
rises.
   _Elimination of previously scheduled increases in the cost of
optional major medical coverage for retirees, with rates to remain
at their 1989 levels through 1990. Beginning 1991, the company will
pay 50 percent of cost increases.
   _Elimination of the $16.82 premium now paid for basic health
care coverage by both active and retired employees.

<HEAD>Chrysler Completes Sale of Gulfstream</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The $825 million sale of Chrysler
Corp.'s Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. subsidiary to an investor group
led by Gulfstream Chairman Allen Paulson has been completed, the
automaker said Monday.
   Chrysler put the commercial aircraft maker up for sale in
December in order to concentrate on its car and truck business. The
nation's No. 3 automaker bought Gulfstream in 1985 for $627 million.
   In addition to eliminating a non-automotive subsidiary, the sale
fattens Chrysler's coffers as the automaker wrestles with
profitability. In the fourth quarter of 1989, Chrysler lost $664
million, mainly because of $577 million in write-offs for plant
closings.
   It was the first quarterly loss the automaker suffered since
1982.
   A group formed by Paulson and the leveraged buyout firm
Forstmann Little &amp; Co. bought the Savannah, Ga.-based Gulfstream.
Paulson, who founded Gulfstream in 1978, will remain as its
chairman and chief executive.
   Gulfstream was the largest part of Chrysler Technologies Inc.,
which also included Electrospace Systems Inc. and Chrysler
Technologies Airborne Systems Inc.
   Chrysler spokesman James Kenyon said Monday the other two
subsidiaries still were for sale. He had no comment on negotiations.

the company had reached an agreement with the dissident group for

   As the Tokyo Stock Exchange took one of its worst
beatings ever Monday, a senior Bank of Japan official reiterated
that the central bank's key concern was inflation _ adding fuel to
expectations for higher interest rates.
   Rattled by a stronger U.S. dollar and speculation that an
interest rate hike was imminent, the exchange's Nikkei Stock
Average plunged 1,353.20 points on Monday, a 4.15 percent tumble
that marked its third biggest daily decline ever. The close at
31,263.24 points was the lowest for the Nikkei Stock Average since
Jan. 20, 1989.
   The decline continued Tuesday. After a short upswing, the Nikkei
was down 691.29 points, or 2.21 percent, at 30,571.95 in early
trading. It was the first time the index dropped under 31,000, even
temporarily, since Jan. 9, 1989.
   The Nikkei's decline on Monday was at least partly tied to the
growing strength of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, which
could help fuel inflation in Japan.
   The Bank of Japan has attempted to stall the dollar's rise in
recent months by selling billions of dollars in the currency
markets.
   There also is speculation that the central bank will hike its
benchmark discount rate to support the yen and fight inflation.
   In the stock market on Monday, many investors appeared to be
selling shares as though a rate rise were imminent.
   Keiichi Nishida of Kidder Peabody Securities said: ``Because
Monday's drop was not the result of panic selling, there is a
widely shared fear in the market that share prices may fall even
further until they really hit the bottom.
   ``But at this point, no one knows where the bottom really is,''
he said.
   The Bank of Japan official, who spoke to reporters Monday on
condition of anonymity, said the stock market's rapid rise last
year set the stage for a downward ``correction.'' He also said that
if the market was having trouble finding its appropriate level, it
is due to political factors and speculation.
   The official acknowledged that the correction _ which so far
this year has cut nearly 20 percent from the Nikkei average _ had
been larger than anticipated. But he reiterated that the central
bank's primary concerns were elsewhere, particularly in controlling
inflation.
   The Bank of Japan official said that although the central bank
can't create specific exchange rate levels, its repeated
intervention should influence the market over time.
   Nevertheless, the dollar continued rising Monday. It closed at a
three-year high of 153.55 yen, up 1.05 yen from last Friday's close.
   Dealers said the Bank of Japan made large-scale interventions
Monday to stem the yen's fall. One dealer with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank
said the central bank bought at least $1 billion worth of yen
Monday.
   The yen's prolonged weakness, coupled with signs of inflation,
has convinced many stock and exchange market participants that
another discount rate hike is looming. Higher interest rates tend
to bolster the yen but depress stock prices.
   The Bank of Japan official appeared to give credence to the view
that the bank will raise its key rate soon. Admitting that the
timing of the rate hike is difficult, he said, ``It may be too late
to act when the indicators are flashing.''
   After several years of stability, the bank raised the discount
rate _ its interest on loans to commercial banks _ three times last
year, bringing it to 4.25 percent from 2.5 percent.
   Masaaki Tanahashi, a currency dealer with Mitsui Bank, said some
market players were hesitant to buy the yen until the Bank of Japan
actually raises the discount rate.
   The Dai-Ichi Kangyo dealer, who requested anonymity, said: ``I
would not be surprised to see the dollar surpass the 154-yen mark
before the interest rate hike actually happens.''

<TEXT>
   Japan's central bank on Tuesday raised its official
discount rate by 1 percentage point to 5.25 percent, effective
immediately.
   The decision followed a meeting of the Bank of Japan's special
policy board, officials said.
   The nation's discount rate, the lending rate the central bank
charges on loans to commercial banks, was 4.25 percent following
three hikes last year.
   The rate increase was aimed at containing inflationary pressure
building up in Japan despite three interest hikes last year. The
jump in the rates was widely rumored for weeks.
   The central bank action is also expected to help stabilize the
jittery Tokyo stock market, and to stem the yen's weakness against
the U.S. dollar.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was
slightly lower at the close of morning trading Tuesday in wide
fluctuations following the third-worst drop in its history.
   The U.S. dollar declined against the Japanese yen. The dollar
ended the morning session at 152.90 yen. It opened at 152.70 yen,
down 0.85 yen from Monday's close at 153.55 yen, and ranged between
152.45 yen and 153.55 yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost 156.67 points, or 0.50
percent, ending morning trading at 31,106.57 after wild ups and
downs. The Nikkei gained more than 260 points after trading began,
then quickly plunged about 700 points.
   ``The market is gradually recovering,'' said Kazuyuki Suzuki, a
dealer with Daiwa Securities Co.
   He said news reports that the Bank of Japan might raise its
official discount rate during lunchtime lent the market some
support. ``With the discount rate hike, the market will recover at
least temporarily because there is one less factor to worry
about,'' Suzuki said.
   Japan's central bank later raised its official discount rate by
1 percentage point to 5.25 percent, effective immediately. The
decision followed a meeting of the Bank of Japan's special policy
board.
   The official discount rate is the interest rate the central bank
charges on loans to commercial banks, and has a strong impact on
other interest rates.
   In its third-largest single-day drop, the Nikkei on Monday fell
1,353.20 points, or 4.15 percent, to 31,263.24, its lowest close
since Jan. 20, 1989. Dealers attributed the plunge to a stronger
dollar and the looming discount rate hike.
   Dealers said the index started higher Tuesday as market players
bought issues to make up their short, or oversold, positions after
the plunge. But they soon began selling shares again due to
lingering pessimism following the dollar's continuous surge.
   In currency dealings, the dollar was moving narrowly around the
153-yen level, traders said.
   Despite the discount rate rumors, the yen failed to rise as many
market players bought the dollar near 152.50 yen.
   ``Market players did not jump at the yen because they still
think that the Bank of Japan may not raise its discount rate
despite all these news reports,'' said Masato Hayashi, a Bank of
Tokyo trader.
   But he said dollar-buyers also were cautious in case of the
discount rate hike.
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 Japanese government bond was
up from Monday's close at 86.50. Its yield was quoted at 7.16
percent, down from the previous day's 7.24 percent.

   Federal regulators Monday agreed to allow the
sale of most assets of the Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie Co. railroad
without requiring protection of workers who would lose their jobs.
   The Interstate Commerce Commission voted 4-1 against requiring
more help for workers than the acquirer, Railroad Development
Corp., already has promised.
   Railroad Development, on suburban Green Tree, has said it will
offer the jobs it retains to current P&amp;LE employees in order of
seniority. It also will credit those rehired with their years of
service and negotiate new contracts with their unions.
   The company told the commission it plans to retain a work force
of 150 to 200 rather the the 417 non-management workers currently
working.
   Dan Vogel, president of Local 1427 of the Transport Workers
Union at P&amp;LE and a freight car repairman, called the vote
unfortunate. ``We have to find out if RDC is willing to negotiate a
fair and reasonable agreement,'' he said.
   Railroad Development is paying $33 million for 146.6 miles of
the P&amp;LE line in Ohio and Pennsylvania, more than 2,200 freight
cars and locomotives and the rights to use other railroads' tracks
in several states.
