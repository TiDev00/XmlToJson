   The son of a slain Hollywood
executive was arrested Thursday in the shotgun slayings of his
parents, and his teen-age brother was being sought in Israel,
authorities said.
   Lyle Menendez, 22, was charged with two counts of murder in the
deaths of Jose Menendez, 45, and his wife, Mary Louise ``Kitty''
Menendez, 44, said Deputy District Attorney Elden Fox.
   Menendez' 19-year-old brother, Erik, was named in the complaint,
and was being sought in Israel on identical counts, Fox said.
   Police would not reveal a motive, but ruled out earlier
speculation that drugs or organized crime were involved. Police
Chief Marvin Iannone said physical evidence linked the Aug. 20
killings to the sons, whom he described as the triggermen.
   ``I don't know if there was one motive or several,'' Iannone
said. ``As in any family, there are a lot of conflicts. Who knows
what really goes on in families?''
   ``The focus became very clear over the past few months that the
sons did it,'' Iannone said. ``We were just waiting for the glue,
binding it together.''
   He declined to elaborate on information that led to the arrests.
   Jose Menendez was chairman of Live Entertainment Inc., a video
and music distribution business affiliated with Carolco Pictures
Inc., producers of the ``Rambo'' movies.
   Under terms of the parents' 9-year-old wills, the sons share a
$10 million estate. They also were beneficiaries of a $400,000 life
insurance policy.
   The complaint includes special-circumstances allegations that
make the sons eligible for the death penalty if convicted.
   The couple were killed by multiple shotgun blasts at close
range. Their sons, who reported the killings, said they found the
bodies after a night out.
   In the months after the killings, Lyle Menendez traveled the
country, making investments and buying stores, particularly
fast-food franchises, said Iannone.
   Lyle Menendez was arrested at 1:20 p.m. as he was preparing to
drive away from the family mansion. He had been under surveillance
for the past 36 hours, Iannone said.
   Erik Menendez was believed to be taking part in a tennis
tournament in Israel. Police were seeking help from the State
Department, the Israeli government and Interpol, the international
police organization.
   At the time of the shootings, nothing was stolen from the
Spanish-style, $5 million home. There were no signs the killers
forced their way in and reportedly no clues at the scene.
   Police said during the investigation that they were looking into
the disappearance of a computerized record concerning Menendez's
plans to write a new will.
   Family members, speaking four months after the slayings on
condition of anonymity, said a relative tried to read a computer
file named ``will'' after the murders, but was unable to do so.
Before a computer expert was brought in, the file disappeared.
   The relatives would not say who might have erased the file.
   Iannone declined to comment in detail, except to say, ``The will
was very much involved in our investigation.''
   The elder Menendez had little money when his parents sent him
from Cuba after Castro took power. He was an executive for RCA and
Hertz before joining Live Entertainment.
   Companies operated by Live had been linked to organized crime
and pornography before Live bought them, but company officials have
rejected suggestions the deaths may have a mob link.

   A fire and explosion damaged a day care
center after it opened Thursday, but children and staff members
were evacuated with only minor injuries reported, officials said.
   Framingham firefighters, responding to a report of a fire at the
KinderCare Learning Center at 8:39 a.m. Thursday, found the
basement engulfed in thick black smoke, said dispatcher Vin Schiavi.
   About 30 children and 6 staff members were safely evacuated,
said Deputy Fire Chief Thomas Potenza. An explosion rocked the
cellar when heat from the fire reached some aerosol cans and paint
cans, but no one was injured, Potenza said.
   Potenza said a large amount of combustible material was stacked
in a basement storage room.
   One center staff member suffered a slight laceration on the hand
from the fire, and a firefighter sustained a minor back injury,
Potenza said.
   Damage to the center was estimated at $40,000. The cellar had
structural damage from the fire, while the upper floors were
damaged by the heavy smoke that billowed upwards, Potenza said.
   Investigators had not determined the cause of the fire Thursday.

   A high-speed catamaran ferry will link Britain and
France starting in June, cutting the current sailing time nearly in
half, ferry operators announced.
   Ferry voyages between Portsmouth, England, and Cherbourg, France
now take nearly five hours.
   The twin-hulled Christopher Columbus, built by International
Catamarans of Tasmania, will set sail for England next month and be
ready for commercial sailings in June, the ferry company,
Hoverspeed, said Thursday.
   It will carry up to 80 cars and 450 passengers, travel at up to
45 mph and cope with waves as high as 18 feet, the company said.
   It said other routes, and the price and frequency of voyages,
will be announced later.
   A giant tunnel being dug under the Channel between France and
England will offer 35-minute rail crossings. The $11 billion
Eurotunnel, a joint project of British and French companies, is
scheduled to open in mid-1993.

<HEAD>Funny Business at American Comedy Network Keeps Listeners Guessing</HEAD>

   Journalists end up in deep trouble if
they blur the line between fact and fiction, but the writers at the
American Comedy Network thrive on keeping people guessing about
what's real and what's not.
   Take their recent spoof interview with the president, when a
George Bush impersonator sought advice on finding a new enemy to
replace the Soviet Union. Or when the ``president's'' opinion on
the ``Summit at Sea'' with Mikhail Gorbachev turned into a
commentary on another superpower meeting: the fight between Sugar
Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran.
   Since 1983, the American Comedy Network has been producing zany,
irreverent skits, mock interviews and fake commercials that disc
jockeys around the country use to boost the insanity level of their
shows.
   ``When you get up in the morning there are certain things you
need _ what's the weather going to be like, are the highways
crowded,'' said ACN general manager and co-founder Andy Goodman.
``And the other hidden ingredient is getting your day rolling, and
comedy is always good fare.''
   Goodman and co-founder Bob James were working at a radio station
in Orlando, Fla., when NewCity Communications Inc. in Bridgeport
recruited them to produce parodies for its 11 radio stations.
   Five months later, they hit it big with one of their mock
commercials _ a parody of the AT&amp;T breakup called ``Breakin' Up Is
Hard on You,'' sung to Neil Sedaka's ``Breakin' Up Is Hard to Do.''
It got so much airplay that a Boston record company made it into a
single that sold 200,000 copies and broke into the Top 80 on one of
Billboard magazine's record charts.
   Within three years, ACN had 128 customers. Now it serves 274
stations in the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, New
Zealand and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
   ACN has several competitors, including Rock Comedy Network, the
Premier Comedy Network, the Country Comedy Network and the
Contemporary Comedy Network.
   ``We started at the time when the need for comedy in radio was
just beginning to build,'' Goodman said. ``We were there to answer
the call, and then when everybody else jumped into the field we
were considered the first and the best.''
   For $1,800 to $15,500 a year, depending on market size, radio
stations get 10 tapes a week from ACN's staff of 18, plus
freelancers.
   Nothing is sacred to the writers.
   There was a commercial for Choke Cola for the Denver Broncos,
who have been whipped in their four Super Bowl appearances. Clients
got a commercial for the ``James Brown Security Alarm System'' soon
after the godfather of soul's arrest.
   Not everyone sees the fun in some of ACN's antics.
   Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. sued over a spoof commercial for a ``white
sale'' at ``Fears'' department store in Johannesburg, South Africa.
The nation's largest retailer eventually settled for $1 in return
for destruction of the tape.
   When ACN did a spot on ``Infidelity Bank,'' it got a call from
the chairman of the board of a Fidelity Bank in Topeka, Kan., who
was afraid his customers ``were going to think the bank was saying
they have sex with their customers,'' Goodman said.
   ``Some (people) just don't have a sense of humor,'' Goodman
said. ``That's one of the risks of doing something in comedy.''
   ACN writers assemble every weekday and flip through such
publications as People magazine, USA Today and The New York Times,
taking the nation's pulse and figuring out what will strike its
funny bone.
   Their scripts wind up in the studio, where ACN's Ed Kelly and
New York comedian Nancy Park record most of the voices. The
finished product is dubbed onto tapes to be shipped Federal Express
to ACN's affiliates.
   The pressure to be funny week after week is enormous and four of
the five original contributors have moved on to other careers.
Goodman, the last holdout, also is thinking to go into television
writing or journalism.
   ``After seven years it's hard because when you sit down to write
your 1,000th fake commercial or 500th song parody, you can't say
it's as exciting as your first fake commercial,'' Goodman said.
``We've done it for seven years, so it just gets tough.''

<HEAD>Milan Fashion Shows Feature Short and Sporty Look</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legs are the talk of the town in Milan this
week, as people try to cope with the shocking news that skirts will
be shorter than ever next winter.
   The general consensus is that too-long legs are almost as bad as
too short, but whatever the case knees must never be chubby.
   This spells good news for diet experts and for work-out centers
and cosmetic companies which will undoubtedly be flooded with women
trying to get rid of those knee dimples, so cute when they were
babies, but now definitely outdated.
   The most extreme version of the new fall-winter 1990-1991
micro-mini, seen at Gianni Versace, played around the hip bone _
hardly a length for the office. This came at the beginning of the
four-day Italian ready-to-wear fashion week, which closed here
Thursday.
   Slightly longer versions were presente by almost every designer
showing this week with the exception of Soprani, Ferre and Armani,
who placed their hemlines a demure inch or so above the knee.
   Another novelty in the short hemline department is the
introduction of sporty bermudas and short shorts into the winter
wardrobe.
   These outfits, as well as the skirts, are usually worn with
ribbed wool tights or thigh-high boots.
   The abbreviated hemline even creeps into fashionable night life
with many elegant velvet and sequined gowns anything but
floor-length.
   For those who don't care for the micro look, the over-30 top
Italian designers showing their wares here this week revived the
thin pencil pants, in light fabric or wool jersey popular in the
1950s.
   There is a lot of sportswear in these latest collections, with
velour sweat suits, knit body suits, embroidered heavy knit
sweaters and loads of fashionable parkas and duffel coats. Even
Jenny, usually a safe address for the career woman, showed lots of
free-time outfits and after-hours hemlines.
   To enoble its sporty thrust, next year's winter fashion uses a
lot of gold detailing both for day and night.
   The new shape is the A-line, which appears in dresses and
jackets alike. Shoulders are narrower in general, although there is
no need to throw away your shoulder pads.
   In the passamenterie department there is abundant use of silk
cording, wool braiding, fringe and lace trimming.
   The most used fabric of the season is velour, which appears
around the clock.
   Colors are either bright shades gleaned from a New England fall
landscape or icy pastels drawn from the hues of a winter morning.
Christmas-bow red is the newest color. Although the traditional
Milan browns, grays and blacks are still around they no longer
dominate the collections.
   Following in alphabetical order are a few highlights from the
shows:
   Armani _ the most graceful and feminine evening wear in delicate
porcelain prints and beautiful embroidered velvet
   Byblos _ cozy Irish knit sweaters with gold and floral embroidery
   Fendi _ fur down coats, made out of puffed leather stuffed with
silk.
   Ferre _ the Midas of the designers with gold appearing
everywhere from evening gowns to parkas
   Genny _ suits featuring the same length for the jacket and the
hemline of the skirt
   Krizia _ lots of comfortable winter shorts and cozy sweater
dresses
   Missoni _ reversible quilted duffel coat with a multicolored
knit print from Russian folklore
   Moschino _ a runway ballet show instead of a fashion show with
dancers haphazardly donning clothes over skin-colored leotards to
decry the state of fashion and its mega shows
   Mario Valentino _ beautiful, bright, tricolored shearlings
   Versace _ micro-mini skirts and the new 1990 A-line silhouette.

   Grants are godsends for writers like
Martha Collins, but she still had to think long and hard before
accepting a $20,000 fellowship this year from the National
Endowment for the Arts.
   The financial freedom was tempting, but it came with a few
strings attached: Collins and 96 other writers nationwide had to
sign letters promising to comply with federal guidelines, including
Congressional anti-obscenity and anti-drug restrictions.
   ``I signed because I can live with it, but I'm concerned by the
tone ... concerned that things could get worse instead of better,''
said Collins, who also directs the writing program at the
University of Massachusetts at Boston.
   Many other artists are similarly troubled by the NEA guidelines
that were imposed by Congress after the uproar last summer over
exhibits of Robert Mapplethorpe's homoerotic photography and Andres
Serrano's crucifix submerged in a jar of urine _ both of which were
federally funded.
   Under the restrictions adopted as part of the NEA appropriations
bill signed into law last year by President Bush, the endowment
agreed to weed out grant recipients whose art might be construed as
obscene.
   But NEA Chairman John Frohnmayer said Thursday he did not
endorse the legislation, though as a federal official he was
prohibited from lobbying against it.
   ``I'm obligated to obey the law,'' he said in a telephone
interview from Washington. ``I do think that the statute is
unnecessary and I hope that Congress in its wisdom will not see fit
to continue it.''
   Among the 1990 applicants, five writers were singled out for
closer examination and all of the more than 4,000 artists who
eventually were granted funds received a package containing the
promissory letter, the NEA said.
   ``Like a lot of writers, I was in a financially desperate
situation ... so I signed, but not without a lot of outrage,'' said
Alison Demming, a Provincetown poet. ``The NEA is giving us freedom
from economic stress, but they're saying ... we can't exercise it
freely.''
   That's not the perception the NEA wants its writers to have,
said spokeswoman Virginia Falck.
   ``Our stand is `Don't let this intimidate you. ... Feel free to
create as you wish,''' she said. ``When you're funding creativity,
you've got to allow room for people to do all kinds of things _
warts and all.''
   Unless those warts include material deemed obscene or created
under the influence of drugs.
   Grant recipients were asked to swear off art that included, but
was not limited to, ``depictions of sadomasochism, homoeroticism,
the sexual exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex
acts and which, when taken as a whole, do not have serious
literary, artistic, political or scientific merit.''
   Some writers felt they were staring down a potential pact with
the devil, opening the gates to increased censorship and state
control of the arts.
   ``It's ironic that we've spent all these years reading about
restrictions on artists in Eastern Europe and just when they're
gaining freedom we're beginning to feel restricted,'' Collins said.
   The Cambridge-based poet also objected to ``sandwiching''
homoerotic art between images of sadomasochism and sexually
exploited children. ``Everyone I've talked with feels it's
alarming,'' she said.
   Other writers didn't take things quite so hard.
   Writer Ursula Hegi of Spokane, Wash., said she signed without
hesitation because ``it was not in any conflict with what I'm
doing.''
   Mark Richard, a New York novelist, said the devil may have been
dangling the money before him, but that didn't much diminish the
temptation.
   ``I would never let anything dictate my work. Ever. But for 20
grand, I'd sign even if I were a heroin addict,'' said Richard, who
earned $7,000 last year. ``Let them come after me for it.''
   The NEA's Falck said the endowment has not so far developed a
procedure for checking up on the thousands of photographers,
dancers, urban designers, painters and other artists who each year
receive federal funds.
   Liam Rector, who directs the Norfolk, Va.-based Associated
Writing Programs, said enforcing the restrictions could prove an
``administrative art-cop nightmare.''
   But enforcing them through an artistic police state would be
scarier, he said.
   That's why the writers' coalition, an umbrella for 50 member
groups including PEN America, the Modern Language Association and
the National Writers' Union, plans to monitor closely the NEA's
next steps.
   ``The (NEA) is supposed to be an arts advocate and at the same
time must comply with this law,'' Rector said. ``The endowment
finds it difficult to defend itself so it falls to the field and to
the artists themselves to protect First Amendment rights.''

<HEAD>Karpov Defeats Timman in 36 Moves in Opening World Chess Match</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It took only 36 moves for Anatoly
Karpov to defeat Jan Timman in the opening game of their World
Chess Candidates Final Match.
   Thursday's game was the first in the 12-game series, with the
winner being the first player to score 6{ points. The series is to
run until April 8.
   The winner of this match will meet Garri Kasparov in Lyon,
France, to decide the world championship.
   The match caries a total prize of $150,000, with the winner
receiving $93,750, and the loser the balance.
   Karpov, of the Soviet Union, handled the Black side of the Ruy
Lopez Igor Zaisetv variation with such ease that Timman, of The
Netherlands, stopped the clock after 36 moves to avoid being
checkmated with a Queen-Bishop combination.
   The game opened slowly with both players following a popular
line in the Spanish system. Karpov went into the above variation
with Bb7 and later introduced a novelty seven moves later.
   According to a grandmaster present at the Malaysia match, Timman
missed a chance to equalize when he moved his Queen to the g4
square. He could have taken the Pawn on d5 but instead went for a
Bishop pair retention that proved to be insufficient compensation.
   If the score is tied after 12 games, two further games will be
played. If these fail to resolve the tie, two more games will be
played. If this again fails to resolve the tie, a series of
sudden-death games at faster time limits will decide the match.

<HEAD>Boston Brahmin Accuses GOP Rival of Waging Class Warfare in

   When wealthy, Republican gubernatorial candidate
William Weld accused his chief rival of waging ``class warfare,''
and using hate tactics, the jokes began immediately:
   About his upper-class accent, ``lockjaw.'' About his native New
England foods, ``boiled.'' And his traditional dress, ``docksiders,
no socks.''
   Not that Weld is incapable of joking about his White Anglo-Saxon
Protestant pedigree himself. Asked recently about the last book he
had read, Weld quipped with a smile: ``Candle Making for Fun and
Profit,'' a reference, he said, to his Yankee roots.
   But Weld was deadly serious Wednesday when he called a news
conference to warn House Minority Leader Steven Pierce, the son of
a carpenter, to lay off his blue-blood background.
   ``I think it's time to get this `class' issue out into the open
and reveal it for what it is: the old-style politics of hate and
fear,'' Weld said.
   Pierce said Weld was being a bit touchy on the subject.
   ``I think Bill is showing an incredible amount of sensitivity.
In a political campaign, a lot of statements are made and things
are hurled around,'' Pierce said.
   Weld, 44, is a former U.S. assistant attorney general who quit
the Reagan administration after questions were raised about his
boss, Edwin Meese II. He now lives in Cambridge, with his wife, a
member of the Roosevelt clan, and works at the proper Boston law
firm of Hale &amp; Dorr.
   He has had memberships in exclusive clubs and has a stock
portfolio worth between $850,000 and $1.5 million. He resigned from
the clubs when he began eyeing the governor's race.
   A Pierce supporter circulated a letter Thursday around the
Statehouse suggesting the Legislature pass a ``Brahmin Rights Act.''
   Republican Rep. William Vernon said he wrote the letter to
inject a little humor into the campaign. His tongue-in-cheek
legislation would ``ensure the Brahmins' civil rights and equal
access to housing employment and elective office. ... The recent
travails of Bill Weld offer ample evidence of the prejudices
against those individuals known as `Yankee Bluebloods,''' he said
in the letter.
   In a state where a generation can still recall ``No Irish Need
Apply'' signs, and where many remember that busing to accomplish
racial integration bypassed rich, white suburbanites and people who
could afford to send their children to private schools, Weld may
have tapped into a lingering bias.
   Todd Domke, a Republican political consultant, has said Weld may
be suffering from the last acceptable prejudice in the state _
against Yankees.
   Another political observer, Marty Linsky, a former Republican
legislator who lectures at Harvard University's Kennedy School of
Government, pointed out the bias hasn't hurt Yankees in the past.
   ``For most of Massachusetts history, Brahmins have been
successful in leadership positions in public life, because people
trusted them,'' Linsky said. Brahmins, in New England, are cultured
people from long-established, upper-class families.
   Paul Watanabe, head of the political science department at the
University of Massachusetts in Boston, said Weld's attack may help
him.
   ``I think Weld is trying to turn what is presumably a liability
into a strength,'' Watanabe said. ``Raising this particular issue
is a good one. I think his dealing with it straight on is good.''
   But former Gov. Francis Sargent, who can trace his bloodlines to
the Puritans, said Weld would do better to leave the issue alone.
   ``The more he says about it, the more he draws attention to
it,'' Sargent told The Patriot Ledger of Quincy. ``Just tell them
to spell the name right.''
   Sargent used to talk up a different branch of his family. ``My
grandmother was Italian and I peddled that all over the state _
where she came from in Italy, what her name was,'' Sargent said.

   Vice President Dan Quayle, leaving Friday to
help usher in new presidents in Chile and Brazil, said his trip
will also focus on economic development in Latin America where ``we
have not been as successful as we'd like.''
   On the trip, Quayle also will press President Bush's effort to
win Latin acceptance for the U.S.-installed government of Panama,
even as both Chile and Brazil snub the Panamanian president
elevated by the U.S. invasion.
   Panama was the only country in the hemisphere not invited to
send representatives to Sunday's inauguration of Chile's new
president, Patricio Aylwin, and also is excluded from the March 15
swearing in of Brazil's Fernando Collor de Mello.
   Governments in those nations, like other Latin countries,
condemned Bush's Dec. 20 military invasion as a violation of
Panama's sovereignty. They had withdrawn their ambassadors from
Panama City to protest the rule of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, but
retained diplomatic relations with Panama.
   Quayle's week-long trip also includes stops in Venezuela,
Barbados, Paraguay and Argentina.
   Now that Chile has become the last country in South America to
hold democratic elections, Quayle said he will be listening to the
economic needs of the debt-and inflation-plagued Latin and
Caribbean leaders.
   ``Political development has been successful in the hemisphere,
but we have not been as successful as we'd like on economic
development,'' Quayle told reporters Thursday on the eve of his
departure.
   ``I will be asking the leaders of the individual countries for
their ideas'' on trade and economic ideas, he said.
   Little progress has been made, except in Mexico, on the Bush
administration's plan to help ease Latin American debt in part
through forgiveness of outstanding loans by commercial banks.
   Quayle said he had called Prime Minister Michael Manley of
Jamaica earlier Thursday to inform him the administration would
provide an additional $10 million in food assistance for the
Caribbean nation, bringing the total to $44 million for that
country.
   Quayle also will relay Bush's plea for a common voice of support
for both Panama and the newly elected government of Nicaragua.
   The countries that have refused to recognize Panama's President
Guillermo Endara generally feel that Panama should have an election
or congressional mandate to legitimize his government.
   ``We're moving toward hemispheric wide acceptance of the
Panamanian government, general acceptance. These sorts of things
will be worked out,'' said Quayle's press secretary, David Beckwith.
   Endara's recent announcement that he would propose a series of
reforms and submit them to the electorate for approval is a step in
the direction that the other Latin countries would like to see,
said a State Department official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   U.S. officials said they are hopeful that diplomacy spurred in
part by Venezuela's President Carlos Andres Perez will result in a
more generous attitude toward the Endara government.
   In Brazil, ``It is likely that the new government will examine
the matter in a new light,'' said a Brazilian diplomat.
   Quayle's trip also offers a potentially interesting twist in
Chile, with the expected attendance of Nicaragua's outgoing
President Daniel Ortega.
   Quayle and Ortega are not scheduled to meet, but in a reversal
of past policy, Beckwith said, ``We're certainly not opposed to
it.''
   The United States, in a policy begun by President Reagan,
refused to meet with Nicaraguan officials. U.S. officials said
Managua should meet for direct talks with the U.S.-backed Contra
rebels first.
   That whole situation changed with the victory last month of
Violeta Chamorro over Ortega and the calls from all sides for the
Contras to give up their fight.
   Quayle will meet with the outgoing Chilean president, Gen.
Agosto Pinochet, who was forced to call an election 16 years after
he ousted the elected government of Salvador Allende. Although
Aylwin won the election, Pinochet is insisting on retaining control
of the 60,000-man Chilean army.
   Quayle will be accompanied to Chile by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., who engendered ire there by pushing the current U.S. arms
embargo on Chile to protest Pinochet's human rights record.
   When Kennedy went to meet with opposition leaders in 1986,
Pinochet's police stood by while 200 rightist demonstrators threw
rocks and eggs and blocked Kennedy's motorcade.
   Quayle will spend only a few hours in Venezuela, where
anti-American protests also are a possibility.
   Perez said his government would not recognize Panama until U.S.
invasion troops were withdrawn and the Endara government was given
legitimacy by the electorate. The troops were out by mid-February,
although the United States still retains its pre-invasion force of
some 13,000 in Panama.
   In Brazil and Argentina, economic concerns are expected to be a
big part of Quayle's talks.

<HEAD>3,000 Years of Fakes: From Furry Fish to Letter From Christ</HEAD>

   Priests in ancient Babylon faked an inscription to
make their temple seem older. A modern Scottish museum had to fake
a fish with fur to satisfy public demand.
   These are among 600 objects in a British Museum exhibition that
displays 3,000 years of the forger's art and suggests that fakes
often reflect what people want to believe.
   The objects range from a faked Roman chariot and photographs of
fairies to a forged Rembrandt painting and a witch's wreath.
   The exhibition ``Fake? The Art of Deception,'' running through
Sept. 2, contains fake jewels, coins, sculptures, fossils,
furniture and porcelain.
   There's even a letter purporting to have been written by Jesus
Christ.
   ``Most of the worst errors in this exhibition are our own,''
says director Sir David M. Wilson.
   ``It's not surprising as we have been collecting for a long time
as museums go, nearly 250 years. The forgers had more than a head
start as they were busy in ancient Babylon 3,000 years ago,'' he
said.
   Wilson admits: ``There is a horrid fascination about fakes.
Although we sweep them under the carpet, we talk about them all the
time because we know we as experts are fallible.''
   The first thing visitors see is a supposed Etruscan tomb of the
6th century B.C., made about 120 years ago.
   ``The British Museum bought the tomb from an Italian dealer in
1871 because the Louvre had one and we were jealous,'' said Dr.
Susan Walker, an antiquities expert.
   ``Within a year of the purchase, the inscription on the lid was
found to have been copied from a gold brooch in the Louvre, but the
tomb was kept on show until 1935 and has appeared in countless
books on the Etruscans and their art,'' she said.
   Mark Jones, an expert on coins and medals who assembled the
fakes from 26 museums in Britain and abroad, said the exhibition
was ``about deception, about lying things whenever and wherever
they are made.''
   ``It's evidence of what people saw and valued in the art of the
past because a faked antique shows much more clearly than the real
thing what collectors valued. Fakes often reflect what people want
to believe,'' he said.
   ``When we fall in love we aren't totally rational in assessing
our loved one's qualities,'' Jones said. ``You can fall in love
with an object but others will see through it because they don't
share your love for it.''
   The show demonstrates how fakes are exposed by electron
microscopes, ultraviolet light, X-rays and radiocarbon dating.
   The British Museum's own archaeologists in 1881 brought back a
Babylonian inscription from what is now Iraq. It speaks of the
renovation of a temple and the large revenues it received from the
king and ends up saying, ``This is not a lie, it is indeed the
truth.''
   But modern studies showed it was a lie, written in about 1,000
B.C. and purporting to be 1,000 years older, probably by priests
who wanted to strengthen their temple's claim to its rights and
income.
   The letter of Christ appears in the ``Ecclesiastical History''
of Eusebius, known as the father of church history, who was
probably born in Palestine about 313 and became a bishop.
   In the invented letter, Christ blesses King Abgar for his belief
in Christ's miraculous cures.
   Then there's the furry trout.
   A Scotsma wrote home from Canada in the 17th century about the
abundance of ``furried animals and fish.'' Asked to provide an
example of furry fish he obliged _ and a modern Canadian is still
at it, putting rabbit fur on stuffed trout, with a text saying fish
in great depths and penetrating cold grow a dense coat of
protective fur.
   ``One of these fish was brought to us by someone who thought it
was genuine,'' said Geoffrey Swinney of the Royal Museum of
Scotland.
   ``We said it was a hoax and sent him away but the story had got
out and public demand to see the furry fish was so strong that we
had to make one _ a fake twice over.''

   Swedish animal welfare activists demanded
Norway permanently ban the hunting of seal pups, which are often
bludgeoned to death to avoid damaging their pelts.
   Norway banned the hunt for pups last year and this year.
   The petitions demanding a permanent ban were signed by 80,000
Swedes and delivered Thursday to Norway's fisheries ministry,
officials said.
   ``We can guarantee that no seal pups will be taken this year,''
Karsten Klepsvik, a ministry spokesman, told activists.
   Activist Staffan Persson told NTB, the national news agency,
that signatures were gathered after a seal-hunting film on Swedish
television a year ago.

   Yippie-turned-yuppie Jerry Rubin has a
new money-making scheme: selling an earth-colored drink packed with
ingredients like kelp, ginseng and bee pollen.
   The 51-year-old Rubin, an independent marketer for the
Dallas-based Omnitrition International, has been recruiting
salespeople for his headquarters in Wallingford. They will sell a
nutritional drink called Omni IV.
   ``This is the best business opportunity for the average American
to make a living and break out of the corporate cocoon,'' Rubin
said Thursday. ``It's going to be in the '90s what real estate was
to the `80s.
   ``What I think the 1990s is going to be about is nutrition and
entrepreneuring.''
   The former Yippie was a member of the Chicago Seven, a group of
radicals who were tried on charges of conspiring to disrupt the
1968 Democratic National Convention. He turned to spiritualism in
the 1970s and then became a Wall Street networker.
   His recruits for the new venture include old friends. One is
Bobby Seale, the Black Panther founder and a Chicago Seven
co-defendant.
   Seale is sold. ``Living in a capitalist society without capital
is a contradiction,'' he said.

   Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti of Italy, at a
ceremony in which he received an honorary doctorate of law from New
York University, urged Americans to look beyond stereotypes of his
country.
   The award coincided with the establishment of a university chair
in Italian studies, to be named for Alcide de Gasperi, the
architect of Italy's post-World War II recovery and Andreotti's
mentor.
   The 71-year-old Andreotti, who has served six times as Italy's
prime minister, noted Thursday that more than 70 U.S. universities
and colleges have set up programs on Italy.
   ``The spontaneous germination of a cultural osmosis between
Italy and the United States must not serve as a pretext for
neglecting the development of these relations. Even today there
persists in America a stereotypical vision of our country.
   ``We would like to offer our American friends a view of Italy as
she is today, without masking her defects, without propagandizing,
but by highlighting her civil, social, cultural and artistic
achievements.''

<TEXT>
   The first U.S. nuclear weapons test of the year
is scheduled for detonation Saturday morning at the Nevada Test
Site, the Energy Department said.
   The test, code-named Metropolis, will be the first nuclear
weapon exploded at the nuclear proving grounds since Dec. 20.
   Department spokesman Chris West said on Thursday the weapon will
have a yield of 20 to 150 kilotons of TNT, large enough for the
agency to warn managers of high-rise buildings in Las Vegas not to
have workers in precarious positions at the time of the scheduled 8
a.m. PST detonation.
   The weapon will be exploded 1,500 feet beneath the surface of
Yucca Flat, about 85 miles north of Las Vegas.
   Last year, the Department of Energy exploded 12 nuclear weapons
at the sprawling desert facility, where the nation's nuclear
warheads have been tested since 1951.

   Tattoo the basset hound went for an
unplanned run when his owner shut one end of his leash in a car
door and took off for a drive _ with Tattoo on the leash's other
end still outside.
   Motorcycle Officer Kerry Filbert was on patrol when he noticed a
vehicle that seemed to have something dragging from it, police
spokesman Mark Mann said.
   As Filbert passed the vehicle Wednesday evening, he saw that the
car was dragging a basset hound on a leash, ``picking them up and
putting them down just about as fast as he could,'' Mann said.
   Filbert chased and finally stopped the car, but not before the
dog reached a speed of 20 to 25 mph and ``rolled several times,''
Mann said.
   The car's occupants, a man and a woman, jumped out and Filbert
told them they were dragging a dog. The couple became distressed
and began calling ``Tattoo! Tattoo!'' Mann said.
   The couple from Renton had been visiting friends in Tacoma, and
the man had taken Tattoo outside before the trip home, Mann said.
When the woman called the man to help her carry something, he shut
Tattoo's leash in the driver's door so the dog wouldn't wander
away, but apparently forgot the animal was there before driving
off, Mann said.
   The 8-month-old dog appeared uninjured, but Filbert suggested
the couple take him to an animal clinic.

   Tootsie the cat is back in her nice,
warm home after spending five weeks in a snow-covered storm drain.
   ``The poor, little thing looked awful when we got her out. She
was just skin and bones,'' said Nicole Lonsdale, who helped find
the cat for her neighbors, Peter and Teri Tyson.
   Tootsie disappeared Jan. 26, apparently entering an open storm
drain which was sealed off by a snow plow clearing the road in this
southern Maine city, the Tysons said.
   The Tysons and neighbors searched the area, but gave up hope of
finding the 6-year-old cat until late last week.
   Tyson was chatting with Lonsdale in her driveway Saturday when
he heard a faint meow from the nearby drain. He prided the lid off
the drain with a crowbar, then got a ladder and climbed into the
drain, calling Tootsie's name.
   The cat poked her head out of a pipe and scampered for Tyson,
who wrapped her in a pillowcase.
   ``It's been freezing and there is no food down there and water
would have been running on her,'' said Lonsdale, who carried the
cat home to an amazed Mrs. Tyson.
   An animal hospital said no special medical attention was
necessary, so the Tysons and their two children have simply been
pampering their pet.
   ``She wants to be around us all the time now,'' Mrs. Tyson said.

   The investigation into the theft of a
coat and hat was only a day old when the prime suspect, wearing his
booty, waltzed into police headquarters and the arms of the law.
   Randolph Ferland, 53, stopped Wednesday at the police station in
this west-central Connecticut town to use the bathroom, but was
arrested after an alert police captain realized Ferland and his
outfit matched witnesses' descriptions.
   The crime drama began Tuesday night when someone sneaked into
the Lutheran Church of Cheshire, and stole a winter coat and knit
hat from a closet. A few church members got a glimpse of the man,
and described him to police.
   Police Capt. Gary Walberg said he was reading a report on the
theft Wednesday when he happened to peer out of his office and saw
the man described in the report _ jacket, hat and all.
   ``He matched the description to a T,'' Walberg said.
   The only thing missing was the victim to identify the coat
Ferland was wearing as the one that had been taken.
   As that thought crossed Walberg's mind, the victim walked into
the police station to see if the coat had been found. It had.
   After spending most of the day in jail, Ferland pleaded guilty
in Meriden Superior Court to sixth-degree larceny by possession. A
judge released him for time already served.

   The 21st annual Reeking Regatta sets sail this
spring, but organizers say the event will change its name because
the bayou where it's held is recovering from its pungent pollution
problems.
   ``We feel there's been a marked improvement,'' said Buffalo
Bayou Coalition President Anna Martin, whose environmental group
sponsors the ``anything that floats'' race held since 1969.
   The Reeking Regatta will be held April 7, but next year's race
will be called the Buffalo Bayou Regatta.
   The event was launched to call attention to the mammoth
pollution woes of Houston's largest bayou, due largely to the
city's notoriously inadequate sewer system.
   But Ms. Martin said system improvements have reduced the amount
of fecal bacteria, a measure of human and animal waste in water, in
the bayou.
   The most recent city measurements, taken last week, showed
bacteria levels at most monitoring stations were below the maximum
considered safe for boating and other recreation that doesn't
involve getting into the water.
   ``A lot of improvements have been made, compared to about a year
ago,'' said Zaki Ahmad, an engineer in the city Public Works
Department.
   However, Ms. Martin said coalition members would not let their
guard down.

<HEAD>USDA to Go Own Way on Food Labeling
^Eds: This stands for the Farm Scene column</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says his
department will use its own recipe when drawing up food labels to
give consumers more information on what they eat.
   In effect, Yeutter has told Health and Human Services Secretary
Louis Sullivan that a plan for requiring improved nutrition
labeling for most foods may fly in the Food and Drug Administration
but not necessarily in the Agriculture Department.
   ``We will certainly study and evaluate what HHS has suggested,''
Yeutter said Thursday. ``There's some merit in having these rules
as consistent as possible, but we make our own decisions at USDA.''
   Sullivan told a food policy conference on Wednesday that the
grocery store has become ``a Tower of Babel'' because of so many
labels confronting consumers. He said some labels omit vital
information and make unfounded health claims.
   The FDA has label jurisdiction over foods except those
containing meat and poultry products, which are the domain of the
Agriculture Department.
   Under the FDA's proposal, which would be implemented in three
steps, processors would have to disclose the fat, fiber and
cholesterol content of packaged foods.
   Current requirements, put in place 17 years ago, call for
nutrition labeling only when a manufacturer adds vitamins, minerals
or proteins or makes a nutrirional claim about the product. About
60 percent of packaged foods now list nutrients.
   Yeutter, speaking to the same group as Sullivan, was asked if
his department would follow up on Sullivan's proposal.
   ``We're going to proceed at what we believe is a systematic and
rational way to deal with these issues,'' he said.
   ``We'll certainly try to reach the same fundamental objectives
as all of us have in mind ... but we intend to do it our way, and
we may well take part of what Secretary Sullivan suggested and
apply it. But there may well be some parts that we would not
apply.''
   Echoing complaints by food-industry representatives, Yeutter
objected to Sullivan's apparent willingness to accept
``differentiated'' labeling requirements on a state-by-state basis.
   ``I don't happen to think that's a good idea,'' he said. ``It
seems to me that consumers will pay a significant cost if we end up
with different labeling systems in 50 states. That doesn't set a
good example for the world, doesn't set a good example here, in my
judgment.''
   Yeutter for years, including his service as U.S. trade
representative in the Reagan administration, has pushed hard for
liberalized trade under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   One of the aspects of the current Uruguay Round of GATT
negotiations, he said, is the harmonization of international health
regulations for agricultural products.
   Yeutter said it would set a bad example at the bargaining table
if the United States is not able to harmonize its own domestic
labeling regulations while seeking such uniformity on the
international level.
   There is no disagreement at USDA with the fundamental objectives
of Sullivan's plan, ``but we want to do it right,'' he said.
   ``If Secretary Sullivan's proposal turns out to be right, that's
great,'' Yeutter said. ``But if we think there's a better way at
USDA we're going to do it the better way.''
   As he has many times before, Yeutter said food safety decisions
should be based on scientific knowledge, not on emotional issues
such as last year's controversy about the chemical Alar used on
apples. The current issue in California over the use of malathion
to control medflies was also cited.
   Yeutter said he fully supported the administration's proposal to
ease back on current ``Delaney clause'' restrictions on the use of
additives shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals.
   He said the rules should be changed to permit a ``negligible
risk'' approach to substances instead of trying to eliminate all
risk.
   ``We ought to have objectives that are achievable, not
objectives that are unachievable,'' Yeutter said. ``All we do is
deceive people when we lay before them objectives or goals or
legislative requirements that will never be achieved.''

<HEAD>Aguilar Case to Jury; Prosecutor Says Judge Lost Sense of Limits</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The case of U.S. District Judge Robert
Aguilar, charged with using his office to do favors for felons,
went to a federal court jury Thursday after a prosecutor described
him as ``a man who had lost his sense of limits.''
   ``It's a Shakespearean tragedy, a Greek tragedy,'' Justice
Department lawyer said of Aguilar's case. He told the jury a
conviction would ``keep the flame of justice alive for those who
don't have anybody, an insider (to go) through the back door.''
   But Doron Weinberg, lawyer for codefendant Rudy Tham, accused
prosecutors and the FBI of ``an extraordinary misuse of government
power'' and said it was the government, not the defendants, who had
obstructed justice.
   U.S. District Judge Louis Bechtle sent the jury to begin
deliberations late Thursday on eight felony charges against Aguilar
and two each against Tham, a former Teamster leader, and Abe
Chapman, an 83-year-old self-styled ex-mobster who was once related
to Aguilar by marriage.
   Aguilar, 58, of San Jose, a 1980 appointee of President Jimmy
Carter, is accused of approaching two fellow judges to try to
influence the criminal cases of Tham and Ronald Cloud, the judge's
longtime friend who was convicted of bank fraud.
   He also is charged with helping another friend, Vera Hoff,
conceal her presence in Mexico, where she fled to avoid a tax
evasion sentence; with twice tipping off Chapman about wiretaps;
with telling Tham's lawyer to lie to the grand jury about Aguilar's
involvement in the case, and with lying to the FBI to derail a
grand jury investigation.
   Several of the allegations are combined in a charge that Aguilar
used his office as a ``racketeering enterprise'' to obstruct
justice, the first such charge against a federal judge.
   Aguilar's lawyer, Patrick Hallinan, claimed in his closing
argument Wednesday that the prosecution was trying to ``slander and
smear'' Aguilar by calling him a racketeer.

<HEAD>Experts Dissect Last 13 Minutes On The Exxon Valdez</HEAD>

   Former skipper Joseph Hazelwood's
defense tried to prove a helmsman's error grounded the Exxon Valdez
by focusing expert testimony on the last 13 minutes of the tanker's
shattered voyage.
   Using computer simulation and complicated charts, two experts
tracked the ship's passage, second by second, as it moved through
the Valdez Narrows into Prince William Sound on March 24.
   Peter Shizume and Joseph Winer showed jurors in Hazelwood's
criminal trial calculations indicating the tanker would have missed
Bligh Reef if the helmsman had turned the rudder right even two or
three minutes before it rammed the reef and spilled nearly 11
million gallons in the nation's worst oil spill.
   Winer indicated that the helmsman, for unknown reasons, turned
the rudder to the right, then back to the left in the last moments
before the disaster, plowing right into the reef on the ship's left
side.
   Shizume, an engineer from Hicksville, N.Y., who created a
complex computer program to simulate ship accidents, said the
helmsman could have saved the ship if he'd turned only half as far
as called for by a third mate.
   Winer, a marine surveyor from Boonton, N.J., who analyzed the
ship's course recorder, said he believes the grounding occurred
about three minutes later than assumed and that a ``hitch'' he
observed in the recorder reflects the unexplained ``counter
rudder'' turn left.
   Shizume, who used various scenarios of what might have happened
to the tanker, said it would have missed Bligh Reef by two miles if
the helmsman had turned 10 degrees right 10 minutes before the ship
ran aground.
   The third mate, Gregory Cousins, who was in control of the
tanker while Hazelwood went to his cabin, said he gave the
10-degree order to helmsman Robert Kagan but didn't look to make
sure Kagan was turning until it was too late.
   The mate suggested that the helmsman failed to follow the order
because he had problems with steering. But the defense has also
suggested Kagan had hearing problems and may not have heard the
order.
   Shizume said his study of the ship's course recorder showed that
Kagan's average turn during the critical period was 4 degrees.
   ``What is your opinion as to what he was doing?'' asked defense
attorney Michael Chalos.
   ``He looks like he was swinging the rudder back and forth,''
apparently without any commands to do so, the retired Sperry
Gyroscope Co. engineer said.
   Hazelwood, 43, faces up to 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in
fines if convicted on all four criminal counts against him.
   During cross-examination of Shizume, Assistant District Attorney
Brent Cole tried to shift blame back to Hazelwood.
   ``So if Captain Hazelwood had been on the bridge and ordered a
5-degree right rudder turn,'' he began to ask, but was cut off by a
shouted objection from Chalos.
   ``Objection, your honor. It's independent of whether Captain
Hazelwood was on the bridge or a chimpanzee,'' the lawyer said of
the calculations.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone upheld the objection.

<HEAD>Researchers Develop Synthetic Gene to Attack AIDS Virus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A molecule created in a California laboratory
has shown in a test tube experiment that it can ambush the AIDS
virus and keep the deadly disease from spreading, according to a
study published today.
   Dr. John J. Rossi, a researcher at the Bechman Research
Institute of the City of Hope in Duarte, Calif., reports in the
journal Science that his laboratory has made a synthetic ribozyme
that can genetically cripple the AIDS virus and prevent it from
reproducing.
   The ribozyme, said Rossi, ``is inside the cell and it's waiting
there like a soldier waiting for the enemy to come.''
   Ribozymes eventually could be useful in combating AIDS and other
virus infections, he said, but the technique is still years away
from being ready to treat patients.
   Rossi, in a telephone interview, said his team first developed
the ribozyme and then made a gene that instructed cells to make the
molecule.
   The synthetic gene then was placed into living human cells in
test tubes and the cells were exposed to the AIDS virus. Rossi said
the ribozyme was able to block the AIDS virus from reproducing
inside the cells.
   The ribozyme works like ``molecular scissors'' that slice the
ribonucleic acid of the AIDS virus, thus blocking the virus from
making copies of itself.
   Ribonucleic acid, or RNA, is used by the virus to force cells to
make more virus. By cutting the RNA, said Rossi, the virus is
permanently crippled.
   The ribozyme itself is a copy of an RNA that other scientists
found in a plant virus. Those researchers discovered that a small
part of the plant virus RNA acted like an enzyme and was capable of
selectively cutting any part of the genetic pattern in a target
virus.
   The term ribozyme refers to an RNA that acts as an enzyme by
permitting a reaction to occur within a cell.
   Rossi said a major advantage of the ribozyme is that after it
attacks and cuts the RNA in one virus, the molecule releases itself
and then can attack other virus particles.
   ``It can do it again and again and again,'' said Rossi. ``It is
like one soldier cutting down 10 or more of the enemy.''
   The ribozyme can be designed to attack any part of the viral RNA
and leave other portions alone. Rossi said he believes the ribozyme
also could be used to combat virtually any kind of virus, including
those that cause colds and flu.
   ``It could be used to treat any virus at all because they all
use RNA,'' he said. ``By destroying the RNA, you can inactivate the
viral function.''
   Rossi said two other laboratories now plan to test his ribozyme
in combating viruses in laboratory animals.
   Even if it proves effective in animals, Rossi said the ribozyme
cannot be used against AIDS until some way is found to introduce
the synthetic gene clinically into humans, a technique that could
take years to develop.
   He said researchers must find a way to assure that the ribozyme
gene goes directly to the proper place within the target cells. He
said there are several theoretically possible ways of doing this,
but none is ready for tests.
   ``We don't have any scientific proof yet that a genetically
engineered cell in a living animal will do anything,'' said Rossi,
but in test tube experiments the technique appears to be
``powerful.''
   In addition to Rossi, scientists that took part in the study
were Nava Sarver of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, a part of the National Institutes of Health;
Pairoj S. Chang of Loma Linda University, and four others from the
City of Hope Medical Center.
   The journal Science is published by the American Association for
the Advancement of Science.

<HEAD>Washington's Johnson Crowd Furious Over `This Loathsome Book'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The people who worked for Lyndon Johnson in
this town are buzzing _ and often furious _ about a new biography
of their old boss that says he stole his election to the Senate in
1948.
   ``Why, why, why would a man want to spend this much of his life
writing about a fellow that he can't stand and whose reputation he
is so passionately bent on destroying?'' demands an injured Jack
Valenti, an aide in Johnson's White House.
   ``I think it is a dishonest biography,'' says Bob Hardesty, who
used to write Johnson's speeches and helped him write his memoirs.
``I don't think it pretends to be fair. I think it is the work of a
man with a burning, unnatural hatred for his subject. It only
presents a dark, evil, negative side of Lyndon Johnson.''
   The book, ``Means of Ascent,'' by Robert Caro pictures a
youthful Johnson who is willing to do almost anything to appease an
all-consuming political appetite.
   It is the second of Caro's projected four-volume LBJ biography.
Caro already has devoted 14 years to the task. The first volume met
with equal hostility from some Johnson fans. One book critic said
it demonstrated ``enraged animus against Lyndon Johnson.''
   The new volume is just out, but excerpts ran in the New Yorker
magazine and they were the talk of Washington's Texas community.
   Ex-Texas newspaperman Bob Mann, now teaching at Emory &amp; Henry
College in southwestern Virginia, says this week's mail brought
three sets of Xeroxed copies of the excerpts from friends who were
afraid he might miss them.
   Caro, in the book's introduction, acknowledges that he paints a
portrait of a despicable person.
   While ``bright and dark'' threads run through most of Johnson's
life, Caro writes, no bright thread is visible in a period when
Johnson ``was all but totally consumed by his need for power and by
his efforts to obtain it.''
   The book covers the years from Johnson's 1941 defeat for a
Senate seat in a rigged election to his 1948 victory _ by 87 votes
_ in a 1948 Democratic runoff over an enormously popular former
governor, Coke Stevenson.
   The theft by Johnson of that primary election has been fixed in
Texas lore for years, but Caro provides new evidence.
   The book also says Johnson pulled strings in Washington to
enhance the power and value of a Texas radio station that made him
a millionaire.
   And it says Johnson made shamelessly political capital from his
war career _ which amounted to flying under enemy fire for only a
few minutes, then accepting a Silver Star from Gen. Douglas
MacArthur.
   ``He didn't seize the Silver Star,'' says Horace Busby, a
Johnson associate for 20 years. ``MacArthur, who was a political
general, gave it to him to curry favor with Franklin Roosevelt, who
liked Johnson. What was Johnson to do _ throw it back?''
   As for LBJ's stolen election, Busby says: ``Johnson went before
a statewide electorate seven times after that and it was never a
factor.''
   Caro's critics say his legwork is meticulous and his writing
thrilling, but his viewpoint warped. They say he finds little good
_ or balanced _ to say about Johnson and nothing bad in Stevenson's
record, despite his touch of racism.
   History buff Jeff Patterson, an aide to Rep. Mike Andrews,
D-Texas, says Stevenson comes across as ``Saint Coke.''
   ``Caro sets out to make Johnson look like a real jerk,'' says
Patterson. ``Give me warts-and-all, but don't try to overdo it.''
   Political reporter David Broder, reviewing the book in The
Washington Post, said Caro's Johnson is ``a complete scoundrel''
and ``a lying, cunning, utterly unprincipled operator.''
   Caro did not respond to messages asking for a reply. ``We don't
want to respond to a single review,'' said Paul Bogaards, publicist
for Alfred A. Knopf, which has printed 250,000 copies of the book.
   Former Johnson aide Lloyd Hackler says Caro ``puts more emphasis
on the negatives _ and God knows Johnson had those _ than on the
positives,'' but adds: ``Its probably the best job of research that
anybody has ever done on Johnson.''
   Valenti calls Caro's work ``this loathsome book'' _ but admits
he read every word of the serialization and now will proceed to
read the book whole.
   Valenti mourns the impact the book is likely to have on
Johnson's place in history.
   ``Caro writes engagingly and that torments me,'' he says. ``This
may become the definitive Johnson biography.''
   But Hardesty says he has no such worries: ``Over a period of
time, when the historians have their say, he'll come out a
full-bodied figure, flawed but an attractive man who had a great
impact on the country.''

   Lawmakers say an imprisoned former official
``will open new areas'' in the probe of federal housing scandals
with testimony about grants and contracts under ex-HUD Secretary
Samuel R. Pierce Jr.
   Congressional investigators are seeking testimony that Pierce
made politically tainted contract awards while he headed the
Department of Housing and Urban Development during the Reagan
administration, sources said Thursday.
   The chairman of the House Government Operations housing
subcommittee, Rep. Tom Lantos, said his panel will vote next week
to grant immunity to Dubois Gilliam.
   Gilliam, who was a deputy assistant secretary of HUD under
Pierce, is serving an 18-month sentence at the federal prison in
Lompoc, Calif., for a conviction in a HUD-related case.
   Lantos, D-Calif., called Gilliam ``a key player'' in awarding
HUD grants under several programs, including the secretary's
discretionary fund, and said he will provide ``critical'' new
information.
   ``Mr. Gilliam's testimony will open new areas not dealt with
previously by the subcommittee,'' Lantos said.
   Lantos said the panel's Republican members would vote with the
majority Democrats next Tuesday to ask a federal court to grant
``use immunity'' in exchange for Gilliam's testimony. The immunity
would bar prosecution of Gilliam based on his testimony to the
subcommittee or information developed from that testimony.
   Gilliam's testimony is planned for late April.
   Lantos said Arlin Adams, the court-appointed independent counsel
who is investigating Pierce and other former HUD officials, told
him that immunity for Gilliam would not conflict with his
investigation.
   He said Adams' probe is limited to activities involving HUD's
moderate rehabilitation program that provided renovation subsidies
for low-income rental housing, and his panel was looking into other
areas.
   Pierce has refused to testify before Lantos' subcommittee since
making one voluntary appearance last spring.
   Several former Pierce aides also refused to testify, citing
their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. Among them
was Deborah Dean, Pierce's former top aide.
   Pierce has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and accuses the
subcommittee of targeting him despite evidence to support his
position.
   Pierce attorney Paul L. Perito said he questioned whether
Gilliam would provide truthful testimony or merely seek to curry
support for a reduced sentence. Perito also said it could interfere
with the independent counsel's review.
   Lantos said Gilliam was receiving no inducement, such as a
reduction in sentence, to testify.
   He said Gilliam has been cooperating with the subcommittee's
staff and information he has provided so far ``appears to be both
accurate and reliable.''
   Gilliam was a deputy assistant secretary in HUD's community
planning and development office. Subcommittee staff investigators
have visited him at the California prison, and sources who spoke on
condition of anonymity said he could provide testimony about
Pierce's role in contract awards.
   Former HUD officials described Gilliam as a trusted Pierce aide,
and agency documents show that many funding requests were routed
through him.
   Gilliam was quoted by The New York Times as saying Pierce
ordered him to give a $300,000 grant to a longtime Pierce friend,
Samuel Singletary, who had managed the secretary's unsuccessful
campaigns for a New York judgeship.
   Pierce's order overruled HUD officials who had recommended
rejection of the proposal, Gilliam said.
   Gilliam, as part of a plea agreement, pleaded guilty to
accepting cash gifts from a HUD contractor and conspiring to use a
HUD grant for personal gain.

<HEAD>Pro-Investment Policy Said Raising Deficit, Tax Burden</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tax policy aimed at encouraging investment
by rich individuals and corporations is raising the federal deficit
and boosting the tax burden on lower-income Americans, says a study
financed by labor and endorsed by Democratic leaders.
   If pre-1978 fairness were restored to the income tax, nine of
every 10 Americans would pay less and the government would collect
an additional $67.5 billion a year, Citizens for Tax Justice
reported Thursday. That would be enough to wipe out the budget
deficit in two years or less.
   ``The real after-tax income of the richest 1 percent of the
population (averaging $400,000 a year) jumped by a staggering 110
percent'' since 1977, said the a labor-financed Washington research
organization. During the same period, the after-tax earnings of a
$34,000-a-year family grew by 1 percent.
   ``We have had a massive ripoff ... and the middle class is stuck
with the bill,'' Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., said in endorsing the
findings.
   ``The arrows of fairness are pointed in the wrong direction,''
said House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
   Nevertheless, Gephardt told reporters, Democratic leaders are
not ready to endorse the study's call for tax increases on
profitable corporations and high-income individuals.
   He said the party's leadership hopes to complete work soon on a
tax policy, including whether Social Security taxes should be cut.
   The report was the latest round in a partisan debate over
whether Americans are better off than they were before Presidents
Reagan and Bush took office.
   A recent Congressional Budget Office report concluded that since
1980, the 20 percent of Americans with the lowest incomes have seen
their federal tax burden rise while the wealthiest 20 percent have
seen a drop in taxes.
   The administration's Office of Management and Budget said the
poorest 20 percent are paying the same share of the federal tax
burden that they paid in 1980 while the richest, as a group, are
paying a larger portion.
   The Citizens for Tax Justice analysis traced tax changes back to
1978, during the Carter administration. Congress approved a tax
bill that year that raised exemptions and standard deductions for
all Americans but also cut the tax on capital gains, which
benefited chiefly those with high incomes.
   The new report blamed two factors for the tax shift away from
the rich: Reagan's 1981 tax reduction, which cut the top individual
tax rate from 70 percent to 50 percent and boosted incentives for
saving and investment; and a steadily increasing Social Security
tax.
   The 1978 and 1981 tax cuts are worth $93.1 billion to the
richest 10 percent of Americans this year, while the remaining 90
percent are $25.6 billion worse off, the report said. As a result,
the federal treasury has $67.5 billion less than it otherwise might
have had.
   Robert McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, told a
news conference that as a result of those tax cuts:
   _``The top 1 percent of the population (with average pre-tax
incomes of $549,000 each) now enjoys an average tax cut of $82,196
a year compared to the pre-1978 federal tax system adjusted for
inflation _ a 36 percent drop. The cost in 1990 of the tax cut for
these extremely wealthy people is a staggering $84.4 billion.
   _``In contrast, 90 percent of American families now pay
considerably more in federal taxes than they would under the
pre-1978 system adjusted for inflation. The typical middle-income
family, earning $31,000, pays $409, or 7 percent, more in taxes.
The poorest fifth of all families pays 21 percent more.''
   The report credited the 1986 tax overhaul with partially
correcting what Citizens for Tax Justice views as inequities in the
federal system. However, McIntyre said, that law credited a new
inequity by taxing some income of the richest people at a rate
lower than applies to many earning less.
   The report called for raising the maximum rates on top-income
individuals and corporations to 38 percent, which would bring in
$30 billion more a year. Those individuals now pay a maximum rate
of 28 percent; corporations pay up to 34 percent.

<TEXT>
   Career diplomat Felix Bloch, suspected of
spying for the Soviet Union but never charged, is appealing his
dismissal from the U.S. Foreign Service.
   Bloch has asked for a review of his case before a three-member
panel of Foreign Service officers to rebut the accusation he is a
security risk. A date for the private hearing will be set later.
   The State Department announced on Feb. 8 that Bloch had been
suspended, that his annual salary of $80,700 was being withheld and
that steps were being taken to fire him.
   The action was taken under provisions of a law permitting the
suspension or dismissal of a federal employee ``in the interest of
national security.''
   The review panel could vote to reinstate the 54-year-old
diplomat, but State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said
Thursday: ``If he is not reinstated, his employment will be
terminated.''
   At the hearing, Bloch will have the right to answer charges,
give explanations, examine and cross-examine witnesses and present
documentary evidence.
   The panel's recommendation will be presented to Secretary of
State James A. Baker III, whose determination will be final, the
department said.
   Bloch has been under investigation since he was placed on paid
leave last June 22.
   Although he has not been charged with any crime, sources have
said the government suspects he was recruited by the Soviet Union
during the early 1970s. From 1983 to 1987, Bloch was deputy chief
of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna. His last job was as
director of the State Department's office of regional economic
policy for Europe.

<HEAD>Seven Industrial Countries' Finance Ministers to Meet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top finance officials from the world's seven
largest industrial countries will discuss volatile currency markets
at a special meeting next month, but private economists question
how successful the session will be.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady confirmed on Thursday that
finance ministers and central bank presidents from the United
States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada
would gather in Paris on April 7.
   While Brady insisted there was ``no special urgency'' propelling
the talks, they are coming at a time when the U.S. dollar has been
rising in value against other currencies, in particular the West
German mark and the Japanese yen.
   A higher dollar threatens to enlarge an already-huge U.S. trade
deficit by making foreign products cheaper for Americans while
raising the cost of U.S. goods overseas.
   ``The dollar's strength is of great concern to the
administration,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston
Co. ``It constitutes a recession threat because it is a further
risk to an already-beleaguered industrial side of the U.S.
economy.''
   While last year's trade deficit of $108.6 billion was 29 percent
below the all-time worst deficit of $152.1 billion in 1987,
progress in boosting U.S. exports has slowed in recent months
because of the dollar's increases.
   Brady, testifying to a House Appropriations subcommittee
Thursday, said the administration hoped further gains could be made
this year in reducing the trade deficit. However, he conceded that
``progress isn't as fast as I would like it to be.''
   The dollar's advance has occurred despite coordinated
intervention by the United States and other governments to sell
dollars on foreign exchange markets and buy other currencies.
   Some analysts suggested that since government intervention has
proved largely unsuccessful, the officials of the so-called G-7
countries might discuss making coordinated moves to change interest
rates.
   Higher interest rates in Japan and West Germany would tend to
bolster their currencies, while lower interest rates in the United
States would make dollar-denominated investments less attractive.
   But such action would need the approval of Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan, who has been resisting administration
pressure to lower interest rates because of concern about
inflation. Greenspan also will attend the Paris G-7 meeting.
   Economists also questioned the likelihood of some bold
initiative to lower the dollar's value, especially in light of
Brady's general caution in interfering in private market operations.
   ``The G-7 process is dead in the water,'' said C. Fred Bergsten,
head of the Institute for International Economics. ``With exchange
rates moving in the wrong direction, it cries out for more
effective international coordination.''
   Brady, who visited European capitals last week, led the effort
to schedule the special meeting. He sees it as an opportunity to
advance economic coordination among U.S. allies, said an
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   French Economics Minister Pierre Beregovoy told reporters in
Paris that he had stressed to Brady the need for greater
cooperation, especially in light of the economic problems that
might arise with the reunification of East and West Germany.
   Some private economists have expressed concern that the
reunification could prove to be inflationary because of the
proposal to exchange West Germany marks for East German marks on a
one-to-one ratio.
   However, Norbert Walker, chief economist for Deutsche Bank, the
largest bank in West Germany, told reporters in Washington that he
believed reunification could be accomplished without a surge in
inflation or a big jump in West German interest rates.
   Walker said increased consumer demand would not trigger higher
inflation because much of the demand would be met by foreign goods,
helping to lower West Germany's large trade surpluses, while
sluggish economic growth in Europe would help hold down interest
rate pressures.
   Beregovoy said the G-7 officials were scheduled to be in Paris
in early April anyway to wrap up details for a new Bank for
European Reconstruction and Development being created to support
emerging democracies.
   The meeting will occur just one month before a scheduled May 7
session in Washington to coincide with the spring meeting of the
International Monetary Fund.

Study Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A study of more than 20,000 heart attack
patients has found that one drug saved lives as well as another
that costs about 10 times as much.
   But officials at Genentech Inc., maker of the more expensive
tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, said Thursday that the
treatment procedure in the study hampered that drug's effectiveness.
   Genentech is consulting U.S. cardiologists about the need for
another study that follows procedures generally used in the United
States, said G. Kirk Raab, the company's president and chief
executive officer.
   The research released Thursday at a medical conference in
Florence, Italy, was conducted in Italy and elsewhere in Europe.
   It found that a patient's risk of dying before leaving the
hospital was the same whether he was treated TPA or with
streptokinase, made by Hoechst AG of Germany.
   TPA is widely used in the United States; streptokinase is more
popular in Europe.
   An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine last year
said one treatment with streptokinase costs $78 at a San Francisco
hospital, while TPA costs $2,268. A separate report has cited a
10-fold difference.
   The Italian researchers found an overall death rate of 8.9
percent after treatment with TPA and an 8.5 percent rate after
treatment with streptokinase. Statistically, those rates are the
same.
   TPA and streptokinase are designed to destroy blood clots that
have caused heart attacks by blocking a crucial blood vessel.
   The newly announced study ``bears out what a number of
cardiologists have been really ... saying for the last four or five
years, that there has been absolutely no scientific evidence that
TPA was superior to streptokinase,'' said an American investigator
familiar with the results, William O'Neill of William Beaumont
Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich.
   ``Streptokinase would now appear to be the drug of choice based
on factors of cost,'' said Dr. Claude J. Lenfant, director of the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Md.
   But, he said, the price of TPA might fall as technological
improvements reduce production costs.
   The Italian study involved 20,749 patients with acute heart
attack from 13 nations. They were randomly assigned to receive
either streptokinase or TPA.
   Heparin, which keeps blood vessels open after other drugs
dissolve the clot, was tested in combination with the two drugs.
The death rate for the TPA-heparin combination was 9.2 percent, and
for the streptokinase-heparin combination, 7.9 percent.
   But the patients in the study who got heparin received it much
later in the course of therapy and through injections under the
skin rather than intravenously, said David Stump, Genentech's
director for clinical research, in a telephone interview from
Florence.
   Stump said all major U.S. trials with TPA used intravenous
heparin ``administered within four hours'' and said that was the
treatment favored by nearly all U.S. cardiologists.
   ``The situation is confusing,'' said Raab. ``Since the results
are inconclusive in regard to U.S. medical practice, the need for a
new trial using the standard U.S. heparin regimen is indicated.''
   TPA holds about two-thirds of the market for the drugs in the
United States while streptokinase has most of the other third.
Another clot-dissolving drug, eminase, is marketed by SmithKline
Beecham but was not included in the Italian study.
   Clot-destroying drugs are credited with helping to improve
survival and shorten the length of hospital stays among the 1.5
million Americans who suffer a heart attack each year. About half
die, making heart attack the leading cause of death in the United
States.
   Genentech, which announced a merger agreement last month with
Roche Holding Ltd., the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, reported sales
of TPA increased 30 percent in 1989, to $197 million.
   The company's stock Thursday dropped $1.12{, to $26.12{ on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Raab said he didn't know how the study would ultimately affect
sales.

   Federal AIDS testing experts are encouraged that
the vast majority of the 2 million people who have been tested for
the AIDS virus aren't infected _ even among high-risk groups.
   From 1985 to 1989, 2.5 million tests for HIV, the virus that
causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, were performed by 63
publicly funded prevention programs across the country, the
national Centers for Disease Control said Thursday.
   Of the tests given, 149,639, or 6 percent, were positive, the
CDC said.
   Out of more than 1 million test subjects in the last two years
whose AIDS risk groups were known, two groups accounted for more
than 70 percent, the CDC said.
   Heterosexuals at risk, including those with high-risk partners
or multiple sex partners, made up 44 percent, and 29 percent were
heterosexuals who reported no AIDS risk factors, but were tested
anyway.
   Fourteen percent were homosexual or bisexual men _ who make up
the largest group of AIDS victims _ and 9 percent were heterosexual
intravenous drug abusers, the second-leading AIDS risk group.
   Positive-test rates were highest for homosexual men who abused
injectable drugs; 17 percent of such test subjects were told they
were infected. The homosexual or bisexual men tested were infected
at a rate of 16.5 percent.
   ``Still, a very high proportion (of tested homosexuals and drug
abusers) are not infected,'' said Dr. Stephen Bowen, deputy
director at the CDC's Center for Prevention Services.
   ``We still have an opportunity to protect them.''
   The CDC said that 12 percent to 30 percent of AIDS tests are
apparently repeat tests, leaving an estimated 2 million people
tested, the CDC said.
   In its report, the CDC said: ``Many of the estimated 1 million
HIV-infected persons in the United States remain unaware of their
infection. Of persons who are aware ... a substantial proportion
had their infection identified in publicly funded counseling and
testing programs.''
   Demand for the publicly funded tests has increased from about
80,000 in 1985 to a projected 1 million when 1989 tests are
totaled, Bowen said.
   Health officials ``don't have a real good handle'' on the number
of people who have been tested at private physicians' offices not
participating in the publicly funded AIDS programs, Bowen said.
Such tests are not necessarily reported to health officials.
   More than 120,000 AIDS cases have been reported in the United
States, with more than 72,000 deaths.

<HEAD>Senators to Push U.S. Aid for Family Planning</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Backers of U.S. support for a United Nations
family-planning agency are seeking to reverse President Bush's
decision to exclude the organization from this year's foreign aid
bill.
   Four senators _ two Democrats and two Republicans _ told Bush in
a letter Thursday that they hope for a compromise. Failing that,
they said they plan to force the issue, which led to a veto of last
year's foreign aid bill.
   Both the House and Senate voted last year to give $15 million to
the United Nations Population Fund, known as UNFPA, to help carry
out its family planning activities in more than 140 countries
around the world.
   But the provision ultimately was dropped from the foreign aid
bill after Bush vetoed the measure. The White House had come under
heavy pressure from anti-abortion forces who complained that the
agency operates programs in China, which uses forced abortions and
sterilizations to carry out its one-child-per-family policy.
   In their letter, Sens. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.; Barbara Mikulski,
D-Md.; Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.; and Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., argued
that Third World population growth poses ``a grave threat to our
own future security'' because of the increasing pressures it places
on the environment and on the political stability of poor countries.
   Supporters of aid to UNFPA are optimistic they can prevail this
time around, in part because the population agency is willing to
provide extraordinary safeguards to make sure the money is not used
in China and in part because of growing GOP fear of highlighting
the abortion issue.
   The senators told Bush that UNFPA has agreed to permit the
United States to earmark its population aid for specific countries
whose family planning practices are in line with U.S. values, and
will allow audits to make sure the money isn't freeing other funds
for use in China.
   The agency has received no U.S. aid since President Reagan
halted it more than five years ago, and a congressional source said
it is anxious to regain American participation ``for the
symbolism'' as much as for the money. UNFPA expects that if the
United States resumes participation, its contributions would grow
in later years, said the source, who demanded anonymity.
   ``With the population of the developing countries projected to
grow by over 900 million during the 1990s ... we cannot afford to
remain outside the UNFPA,'' the senators wrote.
   ``Renewed confrontation serves no one's interest,'' they said,
asking the administration to open discussions with Capitol Hill
aimed at finding a compromise.
   A group of moderate House and Senate Republicans sent a similar
letter last month to Secretary of State James A. Baker III calling
for renewal of U.S. aid to UNFPA and chastising opponents for
miscasting the argument as an abortion issue.
   Bush's veto last year ``sent the wrong signal to the American
public and the international community regarding the Republican
Party's support for international family planning services,'' they
wrote.
   ``This is a women's issue, a family issue, an environmental
issue and an international security issue,'' said the GOP group,
which included two women House members running for the Senate this
year _ Reps. Lynn Martin of Illinois and Claudine Schneider of
Rhode Island. ``It remains an issue of great importance to the
Republican Party.''

   The late Malcolm Forbes left orders to give all
Forbes Inc. employees an extra week's pay, a break on personal
loans and some free advice on what to do with the money: ``enjoy
it!''
   Steve Forbes, Forbes' son and successor as editor in chief of
Forbes magazine and chief executive officer of the corporation,
told staffers Thursday that ``in accordance with my father's
wishes'' the company was giving each of them an extra week's pay
and forgiving all debts up to $10,000.
   ``As Pop put it, `Like a lottery, it's pure chance as to who
benefits,''' his son wrote in a letter to employees, referring to
the loan amnesty.
   ``As for the extra pay,'' Forbes added, ``his advice should be
no surprise: enjoy it!''
   Don Garson, a magazine spokesman, said the bequest surprised
staffers at the Forbes Building on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.
   ``I didn't find out about it until you called me, and I'm the
P.R. man here,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``But it was
something he (Malcolm) had made clear to the kids.''
   Garson said the debt amnesty was particularly generous because
Forbes employees of more than a year's experience are able to
borrow money from the company at relatively low interest rates. He
said that many of the magazine's 750 employees had taken such loans.
   Asked about those thrifty souls who had not, Garson laughed and
said: ``I'm sure many of us here are saying, `Damn it, why didn't I
borrow something?'''
   Garson said he was told the Forbes family would have no comment
on Malcolm Forbes' bequest. ``The letter speaks for itself,'' he
said.
   He said the gift was in character for Forbes, who ``always had
the attitude that the employees were giving to him, rather than the
other way around.''
   Forbes was 70 when he died Feb. 24 of a heart attack at his
estate in New Jersey. Estimates of his wealth ranged into the
hundreds of millions of dollars.
   In London, a British magazine Thursday published what it touted
as Forbes' last interview, in which he spoke of his good health.
   ``I don't think this life is for hibernating and getting ready
for the next one. I think you are given it for a purpose and that
is to live it. Live while you are alive!'' Forbes was quoted as
saying in Hello! magazine.
   Forbes spoke enthusiastically about his next adventure to Brazil
in a hot air balloon during the interview at his South London home
on Feb. 23, and about his love of motorcycles.
   ``I am very lucky to have the health to do all this because that
you can't buy,'' he was quoted as saying. ``I would just like to
stay around a while and keep doing more of the things I am doing!''
   The magazine included seven color photographs of Forbes in his
London house and earlier pictures from Forbes' 70th birthday bash
in August in Morocco.

<HEAD>Senate Budget Chairman Embraces Pentagon Budget Cuts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Slicing $15 billion out of next year's defense
budget would leave a strong U.S. military capable of confronting
the rapidly dwindling Soviet threat, the chairman of the Senate
Budget Committee says.
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., called for the reductions Thursday
as part of a plan to pare Pentagon spending by $80 billion annually
within five years. It was the latest Democratic assault on
President Bush's proposal to spend $303 billion for defense in
fiscal 1991, $7 billion more than this year.
   With easing East-West tensions, military spending _ about
one-quarter of Bush's proposed $1.24 trillion budget _ has become a
focus of debate in Congress this year.
   Most Democrats, and some Republicans, want to cut deeper into
Pentagon spending and use the money to help reduce the deficit,
fortify social programs or reduce taxes.
   Sasser embraced a plan that would cut defense spending next year
to $291 billion, $5 billion below this year's level. The chairman's
proposal would be $15 billion below the figure needed to keep pace
with inflation, which in the unusual world of budget arithmetic
translates to a $15 billion cut.
   Under the proposal, the current active-duty roster of 2.1
military men and women would ultimately be reduced to 1.5 million.
Future purchases of Trident submarines, B-2 stealth bombers,
rail-carried MX missiles and several other systems would be
eliminated.
   But he said the reductions would still leave 529 warships, 34
fighter wings, 15 active Army divisions and 10 reserve divisions.
   ``That's an extremely large measure of security for a world
where, as CIA Director (William) Webster has declared, the major
hostile forces have `irreversibly changed,''' Sasser said.
   Sasser's embrace of the cuts ran into objections from the budget
committee's ranking Republican, Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico.
Domenici said there is too much uncertainty over the Soviet Union's
future to begin making deep defense cuts.
   ``I don't know what that means in reference to the 11,000
nuclear warheads aimed at the United States'' by the Soviet Union,
Domenici said.
   In another clue to the direction lawmakers are heading, a senior
member of the Senate Armed Services Committee said that panel would
also recommend lowered spending levels for the Pentagon.
   Sen. J. James Exon, D-Neb., told reporters that he believed his
committee would recommend defense budget authority in the $291
billion to $293 billion range, compared with the $306.9 billion
proposed by Bush. Budget authority is new spending, some of which
occurs over several years.
   ``It's going to be a slowing down, a stretching out, possibly a
significant reduction in some areas,'' Exon said.
   Across the Capitol, Democrats on the House Budget Committee
completed the second of two consecutive days of closed-door
meetings on the defense budget.
   Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., chairman of the House Appropriations
defense subcommittee told the legislators Thursday that he
preferred keeping next year's military spending just below $300
billion, according to an official who attended the session. That
would be nearly $4 billion less than Bush's figure.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, met with the group on Wednesday but offered no spending
recommendation, said the source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Aspin will meet with the lawmakers next Tuesday and
present them with a list of possible cuts.

<TEXT>
   A House committee chairman is calling for
legislation to put an end to Pentagon ``slush funds'' that he said
totaled $43 billion last year.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., accused the Defense Department on
Thursday of laundering money through the Treasury and hiding
billions of dollars in little-known surplus accunts.
   Dingell, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee and its
investigations subcommittee, also contended that Pentagon officials
have misled Congress about the funds.
   ``I suggest that we ... come up with an amendment to this year's
appropriations bill to terminate both of these accounts to prevent
the unauthorized squandering of this enormous stash of taxpayers'
money,'' he said in a letter to Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif.,
chairman of the House Budget Committee.
   Money appropriated by Congress must be obligated or spent during
a specific time period, Dingell noted. If not, the authority to
spends the funds lapses and the money is returned to the Treasury.
   But obligated funds that are not spent and lapse ``are then
laundered through the U.S. Treasury and come back to the military
services as no-year `M' accounts,'' Dingell wrote.
   Unobligated funds that lapse also return to the military
services as ``no-year funds in another slush fund _ merged surplus
accounts,'' he said.
   ``With the existence of these slush funds, the Congress could
virtually kill a weapons program and find out years later that it
was still being funded from these accounts,'' the congressman said.
   Dingell recently released a General Accounting Office report
that said the Air Force's accounting system understated by tens of
billions of dollars the cost of major weapons systems.
   While his investigations subcommittee was examining the
Pentagon's financial management systems, Dingell said, ``we
recently discovered an astonishing set of little-known _
semi-secret _ slush funds.''
   A Defense Department source, who requested anonymity, disputed
Dingell's assessment, saying the funds are recognized accounts, not
slush funds.
   ``These are not funds sitting idly there and the Defense
Department is using at their whim,'' the source said.
   Susan Hansen, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said the department would
have no official comment on Dingell's assertions.
   Dingell said his subcommittee reviewed a series of congressional
hearings last year in which lawmakers expressed shock over the
existence of the accounts.
   In one instance, the Air Force provided a lower number for the
so-called ``M'' account to Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio.
   ``When Sen. Glenn asked Gen. Ron Yates, the Air Force witness,
about the size of the Air Force `M' account, he was misled by Gen.
Yates who claimed there was only $1.7 billion in the account, not
$4.6 billion,'' Dingell said.
   ``If the Sen. Glenn was shocked by the `M' account, he would
have been bowled over if Gen. Yates had told him about the
additional $6.6 billion `merged surplus account,''' the congressman
said.

<HEAD>Assad Says Changes In Soviet Bloc Benefiting Israel, Promises Holy
War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hafez Assad called for an
indefinite holy war with Israel and bitterly decried the changes
sweeping Eastern Europe as a boon to the Jewish state.
   The Syrian leader also hinted he would make some changes in his
own tough brand of socialist rule.
   In a youth rally Thursday marking his Baath Party's 27th
anniversary in power, Assad denounced the recent wave of Soviet
Jewish emigration to Israel in his first public comment on the
matter, saying migrating Jews would force Palestinians from their
homeland.
   ``Let us now perceive that Israel was the first beneficiary,
among all nations of the world, of the international changes that
have taken place,'' Assad told about 6,500 people in a basketball
arena.
   The rally appeared to be a cross between an American high school
pep rally and a Soviet May Day parade. A brass band pounded out
patriotic songs _ along with the tune ``Rock Around the Clock'' _
and the youthful spectators chanted and cheered in unison as one
bank of the crowd used silk sheets to form massive portraits of
Assad or to spell out patriotic slogans.
   The crowd interrupted the president 61 times with applause or
chanting during his 95-minute speech.
   Assad said the jihad, or holy war against Israel ``should be as
long as time.''
   ``We are just at the beginning of this long time,'' he said.
``It is not we who have to ask `until when.' Rather, the enemy is
the one who should ask this question.''
   Assad complained that in socialist countries once resolutely
opposed to Israel, ``Zionists are now active everywhere.''
   Assad said pro-Israeli delegations now often visit socialist
countries, an apparent reference to Israeli delegations that have
won recognition for their country from some Eastern European states.
   Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia re-established relations with
Israel in the past six months. All the Eastern European countries
except for Romania broke ties over the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.
   He alleged that Zionists in those countries went in ``hot
pursuit'' of their foes in a campaign ranging from ``attacking the
ideas of their opponents'' to ``attack and assassination in the
streets.''
   Assad said Israel still seeks a ``greater Israel from the Nile
to the Euphrates,'' referring to a radical version of Zionism that
foresaw Jewish rule from Egypt to Iraq.
   He denounced an expected mass migration of Soviet Jews to Israel
due to greater freedom in the Soviet Union
   He equated this freedom with aggression, calling it ``the
freedom of occupying other people's territory and expelling them
from their land.''
   Assad did not hold the Soviet Union, a long-time Syrian ally,
responsible for the Jewish exodus, however, and he repeated his
assertion that ``the relationship between Syria and the Soviet
Union is now as firm as ever.''
   The Soviet Union has given Syria massive economic and military
aid, including combat jets, tanks and missiles. Syria reportedly
owes the Soviets $15 billion for weapons.
   Assad mourned the Arabs' inability to forge a united front.
   ``The danger threatens all, and the need for solidarity and
unity is everybody's need,'' he said.
   Assad has patched up a longstanding rift with Egypt, but other
Arab states, especially Egypt and Jordan, have tried in vain to
ease Syrian rivalries with Iraq and the mainstream of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   While he decried the changes in Eastern Europe, Assad hinted he
would make some changes in his own tough brand of socialist rule.
   He suggested a government study on limiting use of emergency
laws that have been in force for decades, and spoke of broadening
parties and organizations in the National Front dominated by the
ruling Baath Party.
   But Assad stressed that his version of ``organized freedom'' was
based on community rather than just individual rights.
   ``Freedom and its organization go side by side,'' he said. ``If
separated, anarchy and despotism prevail.''

<HEAD>Defense Contractor Says Pentagon Spreading False Allegations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of an Ohio company accused the
Defense Department of spreading false allegations about its work on
a critical part for missiles without informing the manufacturer of
the charges.
   Documents released Thursday said the Pentagon is investigating
Piqua Engineering Inc., of Piqua, Ohio, following charges that
safety and arming devices produced by the company failed almost
half of its tests for leaking.
   The devices are used on several missiles, including the
Sidewinder, Sparrow, Standard and Patriot.
   ``It is believed that any ... of the issues can cause premature
(or prevention of) detonation of the devices that could result in
the failure of missiles or other weaponry containing the Piqua
devices,'' said a defense contract administrative message sent to
Army and Navy commands in several states.
   But John Scarbrough Sr., president of Piqua, defended his
company's product and said the Pentagon failed to contact him about
the problems.
   ``The Defense Criminal Investigative Service never talked to us,
has never written us a letter at any time,'' Scarbrough said in a
telephone interview. ``They are giving out untrue allegations
without talking to us.''
   Scarbrough said his 40-year-old company has been manufacturing
safety and arming devices for at least 20 years and has never had a
single complaint. In this instance, he believes six disgruntled
employees are using the government system against the company.
   ``As far as I'm concerned the allegations are all wrong,''
Scarbrough said. ``Everyone wants to blow the whistle but no one
wants to check. We could have told the Defense Department if they
asked us.''
   Pentagon spokeswoman Susan Hansen said the department would
neither confirm nor deny an ongoing investigation.
   In a Jan. 30 memorandum, the Pentagon's Inspector General office
warned that ``the potential may exist for failure of the safety and
arming devices manufactured by Piqua.''
   This could ``subsequently impact on the integrity of the weapons
systems containing these devices,'' wrote William G. Dupree, the
deputy assistant inspector general for investigations.
   The documents were obtained by the Project on Government
Procurement and released by the independent group to The Associated
Press and other news organizations.
   Piqua employees allegedly have been told not to reject devices
even if they fail leak tests. Instead, workers are to repair the
devices using epoxy resin to seal the leaks.
   Military specifications call for the devices to pass the leak
tests to ensure that they are sealed and to prevent contamination
and corrosion.
   ``Piqua is believed to have internally experienced as high as a
50 percent failure rate of safety and arming devices being leak
tested,'' said the inspector general's document.
   ``The areas most commonly encountering leakage problems are
either around the window of the device or in the area of the
electrical connector.''
   Scarbrough said that after initial checks, the failure rate was
less than 1 percent and ``when they leave here they don't leak at
all.'' Information on the tests have been substantiated by three
Defense Department inspectors at the Ohio plant, he said.
   The inspector general's memo also said questions have been
raised about holes in the device, to which detonators and detonator
sleeves are attached.
   ``It is believed the holes cannot correctly accept the
detonators and sleeves and that Piqua utilizes unauthorized repair
and rework procedures to correct the problem,'' the document said.
   The memo said there had been allegations that employees were
told to use hand tools to enlarge holes that were too small and
resorted to unapproved oversized detonators on holes that were too
large.
   In response to that allegation, Scarbrough said the Navy ``knew
all about the bored holes.''
   In addition, inspectors at Piqua allegedly approved electrical
wires on the devices that had failed military specifications on
solderability tests.
   Scarbrough said the wiring the company received was tested and
rejected if defective and replaced by the vendor. Defense
Department inspectors at his plant also examined the wiring, he
said.

   With a stroke of his pen last fall,
President Bush invited people fleeing countries where population
control is accomplished by forced abortions and sterilizations to
seek asylum in the United States.
   But a Chinese family that is apparently the first to accept that
invitation is beginning to wonder whether it was made sincerely.
   The order enabled Li Jin Lin and his family, who previously had
been separated and threatened with jail, the right to live and work
temporarily in the United States.
   Their application to live here permanently, however, is bound in
red tape.
   Government officials refuse to say what's holding the case up,
but the family's lawyer, Kathleen Rimar, said she is beginning to
doubt Bush's commitment to protecting Chinese refugees.
   ``These four Chinese people came here right at the worst time,''
Rimar said. ``They seem to be the testing case for whether this is
going to work. So far, I think the executive order isn't doing very
well.''
   Bush's directive allows foreign nationals who are fleeing forced
abortion or sterilization policies to apply for political asylum in
the United States.
   The directive, though not specifically for Chinese, was part of
a Nov. 30 order allowing many Chinese citizens to remain in the
United States indefinitely after the June massacre of pro-democracy
demonstrators in Beijing.
   Bush made the order while vetoing stiff sanctions against China.
   Li, a 37-year-old machinist, and his 34-year-old wife, Wang Sai
Zhen, fled the city of Fuzhou after Ms. Wang became pregnant with
the couple's second child. She had undergone several abortions and
was told another would endanger her life.
   The couple and their 19-year-old nephew, Chun Kong Cheung, made
their way to Canada and paid smugglers about $1,500 each to get
them into the United States, according to the government.
   Immigration officers caught them in Albany last March and sent
Li back to Canada, allowing his wife to stay temporarily because of
her advanced pregnancy. When Li and his nephew tried to cross the
border again in October, they were thrown in jail.
   Li staged a hunger strike and said he would rather serve prison
time in the United States than risk death or sterilization if he
were forced to return to China.
   Anti-abortionists took up the cause.
   The Rev. Paul Schenck, a local minister involved in Operation
Rescue, brought the case up with aides to Vice President Dan
Quayle. Then came Bush's order protecting Chinese refugees.
   ``In a very direct sense, (the order) means lives saved,''
Schenck said. ``In a broader sense, it equates abortion as one of
the tools of a repressive government. The same attitude that would
bring the Chinese government to run over protesters with tanks is
the same malevolence that would lead them to kill nascent
children.''
   Things have improved for the Lis. The Immigration and
Naturalization Service allowed them to remain in the United States
while their asylum application was decided. They were freed from
jail, received work permits and settled in New York City.
   But the State Department has yet to rule on their asylum
request, submitted last year, and the regional immigration court
that must hear their case is in the midst of a reorganization _
meaning it may be months before the uncertainty is resolved, Rimar
said.
   John J. Ingham, district director of the INS, said he was not
free to comment on the case. Nat Kingsley, a State Department
spokesman, said the department's policy is not to comment on
individual asylum cases.

<HEAD>Dollar, Stocks Rise in Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose
Friday despite the continuing appreciation of the dollar against
the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average ended the week at 33,993.12,
up 302.23 points or 0.90 percent. It gained 328.55 points Thursday.
   The dollar closed at 151.15 yen, up 0.32 yen. It started trading
Friday at 151.07 yen and ranged between 151.00 and 151.40 yen.
   Yields on benchmark No. 119 10-year government bonds were quoted
at 7.170 percent at 3 p.m., down from 7.205 percent at the market's
closing Thursday.
   Haruhito Ichimura, a broker with Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru
Securities, said stocks drew strength from technical factors.
   Following Thursday's close of trading stock futures contracts
for March delivery, market participants had expected dealers to
sell actual stocks Friday and buy the new future contracts due in
June.
   However, spot purchases predominated, Ichimura said, sending the
Nikkei index up 600 points.
   But despite the morning rebound, the continuing depreciation of
the yen was worrying many investors, he said.
   Dealers still expect the Bank of Japan will be forced to raise
its discount rate to counteract the inflationary impact of the
yen's decline. Higher rates tend to dampen demand for stocks.
   ``To some extent, investors have discounted a possible increase
in the discount rate, but there is some uncertainty because no one
knows whether the rise will 0.5 percent 1.0 percent,'' Ichimura
said. The rate stands at 4.25 percent.
   ``The foreign exchange rate is the biggest problem. It will have
a tremendous impact on stocks,'' he added.
   On the currency market, traders said the prevailing sentiment
was to buy dollars, but intervention by the Bank of Japan prevented
the yen from weakening too far.
   A trader with Daiwa Bank, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said he did not know the size of the central bank's dollar-selling
intervention, but added it was ``not so big.''
   The Bank of Japan does not comment on its market activities.
   At a news conference Friday morning, Finance Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto told reporters that the dollar's strength partly reflects
the international situation. He also refused to confirm that a
Group of Seven meeting to discuss exchange rates would take place
next month, even though U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady
announced Thursday that a meeting would take place in Paris.
   The Daiwa trader said Hashimoto's remarks had little impact on
the Tokyo market and said dealers didn't know whether to believe
the Japanese minister or not.
   The Group of Seven countries are the United States, Japan, West
Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.

   The Senate, in its first major vote on a
compromise clean air bill, rejected a proposal to tighten controls
on toxic air pollution Thursday night after Senate leaders said it
threatened their agreement with the White House.
   The vote to kill the amendment was 65-33.
   Senate leaders later put off a vote on a proposal by Sen. Robert
Byrd, D-W. Va., to help coal miners who lose their jobs because of
tougher pollution controls. The $700 million ``safety net'' for
miners was strongly opposed by the Bush administration.
   Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., said passage of the Byrd amendment would
jeopardize the compromise agreement with the administration and
could lead to no clean air bill being approved by the Senate.
   The senators adjourned early today and would resume
consideration of the bill later in the day.
   The amendment on tougher controls on toxic chemicals from
automobiles was one of a string of ``strengthening'' provisions
expected to be brought to the floor by senators arguing the
compromise legislation isn't strong enough.
   The vote was seen as an indicator on the strength of support for
a compromise worked out by Senate leaders and the Bush
administration to ease Senate approval for the first toughening of
federal air pollution controls in 13 years.
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., called his amendment necessary to
protect citizens from cancer-causing chemicals, noting more than
half of such chemical releases come from automobiles, trucks and
buses.
   But the measure, opposed by the Bush administration because of
its reported $1.5 billion price tag, was described by Sen. Max
Baucus, D-Mont., as a ``deal breaker'' _ meaning its passage would
cause a compromise agreement with the Bush adminstration on clean
air to fall apart.
   ``If this amendment passes the deal will be off, the deal will
be busted and there very well could be no clean air act,'' said
Baucus, a floor manager for the bill, shortly before the vote.
   Both Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sen.
Bob Dole, R-Kan., the minority leader, asked that the amendment be
rejected.
   The Senate throughout the day wrestled with a stream of
amendments, and more were expected.
   A number of senators unveiled proposals earlier Thursday for
more stringent provisions, many aimed at automobiles.
   Lautenberg, whose amendment was among those unveiled, told
reporters, ``We know the odds are heavy against us.''
   The clean air measure represents the first tightening of federal
air pollution control laws in 13 years, It calls for sweeping curbs
on smog-causing pollution from automobiles and industrial plants
and requires new cuts in acid rain pollutants from coal-fired
electric power plants.
   A similar bill remains in committee in the House.
   In earlier floor action Thursday, the senators:
   _Approved by voice vote a requirement that the Environmental
Protection Agency take into account carbon dioxide emissions, which
contribute to global warming, when making urban transportation flow
studies.
   _Approved 80-16 an amendment that requires that HCFCs, or
hydrochlorofluorocarbons, be phased out by 2030. The HCFCs can
sometimes subsitute for CFCs or chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals that
are widely used in refrigeration and other areas but cause damage
to the earth's protective ozone layer.
   HCFCs typically have only about 5 percent of the
ozone-destroying potential of the most common CFCs. Critics of
their use have cautioned that they still pose a threat to ozone
depletion if relied on permanently.
   Meanwhile, an amendment requiring automakers to increase fuel
efficiency by setting limits on carbon dioxide emissions was
withdrawn by its sponsor, Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev. The measure
had been vigorously opposed by the auto industry and the White
House and deleted from an early draft of the bill.
   The Lautenberg amendment was the first of a series of
``strengthening'' amendments that are expected to be offered by
senators who believe the Senate-White House compromise weakened key
parts of the original Senate bill.
   The proposed amendments still to be considered would tighten
controls on smog-causing pollution from automobiles and industrial
sources in urban areas as well as expanding the use of alternative,
clean-burning fuels.
   The amendments would expand the cities that would have to meet
pollution standards through the use of cleaner fuels; require fleet
operators to use clean burning fuels; impose a second round of auto
tailpipe emission standards in the year 2003, and broaden the
number of businesses that would have to comply with smog-related
pollution controls so small polluters are included.
   Another amendment in the package would reinstate in the bill a
requirement that the Environmental Protection Agency impose a
pollution control program if a city fails to enact one. The EPA
currently has the authority.

<HEAD>Guerrilla Group Lays Down Weapons, But Other Rebels Refuse To
Disarm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STAN YARBRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>

   A guerrilla chief says his fighters have
ended a 16-year struggle that included the 1985 takeover of Palace
of Justice, in which 11 Supreme Court justices and more than 100
others were killed.
   Other rebel groups, however, refused to follow the decision
Thursday by the April 19 Movement, or M-19, to begin disarming and
to accept a government amnesty.
   The M-19 leader, Carlos Pizarro, now is seeking power within the
political structure as a candidate for mayor of Bogota in elections
Sunday. He and President Virgilio Barco are to sign the final peace
accord Saturday.
   In a ceremony Thursday, the guerrilla group turned 65 weapons
over to an international committee headed by a Venezuelan general,
Ernesto Uscategui. The committee included Socialist International
delegates from Chile, Britain, Finland and Switzerland.
   Pizarro gave up his 9mm automatic pistol, Caracol radio network
reported.
   Pizarro then told about 800 followers in the southern town of
Santo Domingo to hang up their battle fatigues and prepare to fight
for peace, said Hernando Correa, an Interior Ministry spokesman in
Bogota.
   Radio reports had placed the number of M-19 followers in the
town at 1,800.
   M-19 spokesman Ramiro Lucio told reporters all the rebels'
weapons would be turned over in Santo Domingo and nearby Hobo.
   Radio reports said the government was planning to melt down the
weapons and use the metal to forge a monument to peace.
   Five other guerrilla groups including the National Liberation
Army, blamed for 293 kidnappings in the first two months of the
year, say they will keep up their armed struggles.
   The National Liberation Army has pledged never to negotiate with
the government. As part of its campaign to disrupt Sunday's
congressional and municipal elections, the group Wednesday and
Thursday kidnapped 10 people, including election officials, police
and political leaders, a police statement said.
   But M-19's action Thursday disarms an outfit that mounted some
daring rebel attacks. In 1980, it took the U.S. ambassador and 15
other envoys hostage. Five years later, its capture of the Palace
of Justice and battle with security forces led to the deaths of 115
people, including 11 Supreme Court justices.
   The disarmament came after 13 months of peace talks with the
Barco administration in Santo Domingo.
   M19 promised to abandon its armed struggle and transform itself
into a political party in exchange for amnesty.
   The movement directed its campaign against capitalism and U.S.
``imperialism'' and had links with other Latin American underground
groups.
   Pizarro had previously thanked Pope John Paul II for the Roman
Catholic Church's mediation in the talks. In a message Thursday to
the papal nuncio, Angelo Acerbi, the M19 leader asked the pope to
pray for peace in Colombia.
   Acerbi was one of the 16 ambassadors taken hostage by the M19 on
Feb. 27, 1980, when the group seized the Dominican Republic Embassy
in Bogota.
   The embassy takeover ended two months later, and unconfirmed
reports said the government paid up to $2 million for the release
of the hostages, including U.S. Ambassador Diego Asencio.
   The M19, formed in 1974, takes its name from the date of 1970
presidential elections, which it claimed were fraudulent.

<HEAD>New Plan Called a Throwback to ``Horse-and-Buggy Years''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's blueprint for the
nation's transportation network will take the country back to the
``horse and buggy years'' instead of guiding it into the next
century, a former transportation secretary contends.
   ``By forcing states to come up with more money, the
administration's national transportation plan only hurts those
states that can least afford it,'' Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., said
Thursday night on the Senate floor.
   Adams and other Democratic critics said the plan bears the thumb
prints of White House chief of staff John Sununu, who is bent on
seeing that President Bush keeps his pledge of ``no new taxes.''
   ``Everyone seems to be paying except the federal government,''
said Adams. ``This plan isn't a road map into the '90s. It's a road
map back into the horse and buggy years'' when toll roads and
turnpikes were the rule, not the exception.
   The criticism by Adams, who served as transportation secretary
under President Carter from 1977 to 1979, was far from the only to
greet the proposal developed by Transportation Secretary Samuel K.
Skinner.
   Skinner unveiled the 129-page plan with Bush on Thursday morning
and defended it later before the House surface transportation
subcommittee, which must formulate a five-year highway and mass
transit spending plan.
   Many of the proposals in Skinner's plan, ``Moving America Into
the 21st Century,'' are contained in the administration's 1991
budget proposal.
   The plan calls for more toll roads, local gas taxes, user fees,
private investments, competition, deregulation, research into
futuristic systems and openness to foreign air carriers as well as
increased attention to safety and protection of the environment.
   Skinner said that with the higher responsibility comes greater
local flexibility and room for innovation. Although rural states
should end up with a greater share of federal dollars as urban
areas find other financing arrangements, it is up to Congress to
fight out the balance between urban and rural interests, he said.
   ``To make our position known, we're going to want to get a lot
of advice and watch this evolve in the House and the Senate,'' he
said.
   Skinner received Republican praise for the plan. Rep. Bud
Shuster, R-Pa., called it an ``excellent first step.'' Other GOP
members of the subcommittee praised the proposal to encouraging
private investment.
   But even Republicans expressed impatience with the continued
fight over the combined $25 billion in two transportation trust
funds _ one for aviation and one for highways _ that comes up in
any transportation debate.
   Both are financed from fuel and airline ticket taxes and other
fees paid directly by users of the transportation system. The money
is supposed to be used for capital improvemets, but the aviation
fund has been used over the years to help support operations of the
Federal Aviation Administration.
   The Republicans differed from the Democrats only over who should
be blamed for holding up the funds, which like the Social Security
trust fund help make the budget deficit look smaller.
   Subcommittee Chairman Norm Mineta, D-Calif., called the funds
the administration's ``Swiss bank account'' and said they should be
removed from the budget.
   Skinner said his plan calls for spending the money. But he
argued that large amounts are earmarked for projects for which the
bills will come in the future.

   John R. Dunne, President Bush's nominee to be
assistant attorney general for civil rights, appears to be on a
fast track to confirmation.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee voted Thursday to approve Dunne's
nomination, and a staff aide said a vote by the full Senate could
come as early as today.
   Dunne, a former New York state legislator, has the bipartisan
backing of both New York senators, the state's House delegation and
Gov. Mario Cuomo. But some committee members voiced reservations
about him.
   At Dunne's confirmation hearing Wednesday, the committee grilled
Dunne on his lack of civil rights experience, membership in clubs
that excluded women, votes against school busing and stock holdings
in a company that does business in South Africa.
   But only one committee member, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio,
opposed Dunne's confirmation in Thursday's voice vote.
   ``I'm not going to vote for Mr. Dunne, but I'm not going to make
an effort to persuade'' others against him, Metzenbaum said.
   Metzenbaum repeated his complaint that Dunne had done nothing to
change the discriminatory policies of clubs to which he had
belonged. But he added, ``I believe Mr. Dunne will probably be as
good an appointee to head the division as we are going to get from
this administration.''
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., also sounded lukewarm about Dunne.
``I think his temperament will be at least reasonably good,'' he
said.
   Dunne, 60, of Garden City, N.Y., was nominated in January to be
assistant attorney general for civil rights. The post has been
vacant since December 1988 when William Bradford Reynolds resigned.
   Bush's first nominee for the job, William C. Lucas, then a
Michigan county executive, was rejected by the committee by a 7-7
vote last August. Lucas, who is black, had spent most of his career
in law enforcement and had little litigation experience. He was
also opposed by many civil rights organization.

   A major factor behind the nation's infant
mortality rate _ low birth weight _ is headed the wrong way after
10 years of improvement, according to federal experts in infant
health.
   The rate of low birth weight rose 2 percent from 1985 to 1987,
the latest year for which statistics are available, after a 9
percent drop from 1975 to 1985, the national Centers for Disease
Control reported Thursday.
   Sixty-nine out of 1,000 babies born in 1987 were under 5{ pounds
_ considered low birth weight _ compared with 67.5 out of 1,000 in
1985. The 1987 figures, nonetheless, are improved from 73.9
reported in 1975.
   The rate of babies born at ``very low'' birth weight _ below 3
pounds, 4 ounces _ is rising even faster, up 6.8 percent from 1975
to 1987, the report said. In 1987, 12.4 out of every 1,000 births
was below 3 pounds, 4 ounces, compared with 11.6 in 1975.
   ``This rate is a small proportion of births, but it's
increasing, which makes it more difficult in the future to improve
our infant mortality rate,'' said Dr. Carol Hogue, director of the
CDC's Division of Reproductive Health.
   Improvements in the nation's infant mortality rate in the past
two decades are largely because of improved means of keeping
premature babies alive _ not because of improved infant health, she
said.
   ``We're not sure we can continue to improve infant mortality by
improving this very expensive technology,'' she said. ``We really
need to focus on reducing the incidence of low birth weight.''
   Babies weighing less than 3 pounds, 4 ounces are 90 to 100 times
more likely to die in their first year than other babies, she said.
Infants under 5{ pounds run at least a five times greater risk of
death than babies of normal weight _ about 6{ to 9{ pounds.
   The rate of low birth weight among black infants is more than
twice the rate for white infants: 127.1 per 1,000 blacks in 1987,
compared with 56.8 for whites. The disparity has widened since 15
years ago, when the rates were 130.9 for blacks and 62.6 for whites.
   Low birth weight rose less than 1 percent for whites between
1985 and 1987, but 2 percent for blacks.
   The Atlanta-based CDC called the reasons behind the black-white
gap ``complex.'' More black women are in high-risk groups for
underweight babies: poor, unmarried, under 20, poorly educated, or
lacking proper prenatal care, the agency said.
   Other factors include poor nutritional status, close-together
pregnancies and higher rates of unwanted births, the CDC said. More
than 16 percent of underweight black babies were unwanted or
mistimed pregnancies, the CDC said.
   Most low birth-weight babies are premature babies; nearly six in
10 are born earlier than 37 weeks of pregnancy, compared with the
standard 40 weeks. Each year, some 3.5 million babies are born in
the United States.

<HEAD>White Woman Has Black Baby Allegedly Because of Sperm Bank Error</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A white woman who wanted to have her terminally
ill husband's baby has charged in a lawsuit that a sperm bank and
fertility service mixed up its samples and she gave birth to a
black daughter.
   The woman sued Idant Laboratories Inc. and Advanced Fertility
Services, saying the girl, now 3, is being subjected to racial
prejudice and taunted because she does not resemble her parents.
   The woman's attorney, David Gould, would not specify the charges
in the lawsuit, which was filed in state Supreme Court last fall
but disclosed only Thursday in an article in the New York Law
Journal.
   ``The woman loves her daughter, but she wanted to have her
husband's baby,'' said Gould. ``She's the target of scandal and
discrimination where she lives, and the little girl is being teased
and taunted by her playmates. Little kids are saying to the girl,
`How come you look different than your mommy?'''
   Gould cited her emotional distress in asking reporters not to
disclose the name of the woman, whose husband died of cancer in
April.
   The couple paid Idant to store the husband's sperm in 1985 after
he was diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma, a cancer that requires
chemotherapy the couple feared could damage his sperm, according to
the lawsuit.
   ``As my husband's illness progressed,'' the woman was quoted as
saying in court papers, ``I decided that having his child was the
bond that would link us together forever.''
   In March 1986, the woman contacted Advanced Fertility Services
to get the sperm samples from Idant and use them for insemination.
   Advanced Fertility and Idant disagree about what happened them.
   Robert Whittaker, a lawyer for Advance Fertility, said the sperm
samples it used to inseminate the woman came from Idant.
   Idant's president, Dr. Joseph Feldschuh, said the sperm used by
Advanced Fertility was not from the sample his company provided.
   The child was born in December 1986, and soon after, ``It became
apparent that she was not my husband's child,'' the woman said.
   Feldschuh said the DNA of the husband's sperm stored at Idant
does not match the child's DNA.
   ``The DNA tests done in this case definitively establish that
the problem was not with Idant labs,'' Feldschuh said. ``The child
is not from our donor.''
   Whittaker refused to comment on the child's paternity, saying he
had not seen any DNA test results.
   Under New York law, the woman will have to prove which party is
at fault. If the case goes to trial, the defense could try to
suggest that neither defendant is at fault, that the woman
conceived the child in an extramarital affair and not as a result
of an insemination procedure.
   Gould said that because of the likely scandal, the woman would
never have sued had it been up to her. He suggested that her
required cooperation in a state case against Idant resulted in her
case becoming public.
   Frances Tarlton, spokeswoman for the state Health Department,
said her agency is investigating Idant _ which Feldschuh called the
largest licensed sperm bank in the country _ because of a complaint
related to the woman's suit. She refused to comment further.

   President Daniel Ortega says armed
citizens will fight U.S.-supported Contra rebels if they do not
disband before the new government takes office April 25.
   But Ortega also said Thursday that even if the rebels do not
demobilize, he will ``turn over the keys to the government house''
to President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.
   He made the comments before thousands of people at a rally
celebrating International Women's Day.
   ``I am convinced that in the same way that the Contras say they
will not disarm ... that the people are willing to grab the arms to
finish the Contras once and for all,'' Ortega said.
   ``Thousands of weapons are in the hands of the people,'' he said.
   Since the Sandinistas' Feb. 25 election loss to the United
National Opposition, known as UNO, there have been numerous reports
of citizens being armed and trained for combat in ``sovereignty
battalions'' by the governing leftist party.
   Civilians proudly show their new AK-47 combat rifles to
reporters.
   Opposition leaders point to the reports of weapons being handed
out to civilians in expressing alarm over a Sandinista bill
introduced this week in the legislature that would would absolve
anyone of crimes committed through the end of March.
   The law would apply to crimes committed between July 19, 1979,
the day of the victory of the Sandinista revolution that overthrew
dictator Anastasio Somoza, and March 31.
   With the Sandinistas' present 61-seat majority in the
legislature to 35 seats among six opposition parties, the law is
assured passage. On Thursday the bill was remitted to a committee
for review, to be followed by a vote.
   The Sandinistas are taking the action before they lose their
majority. In the new legislature, UNO will have 52 seats and the
Sandinistas 39.
   In his speech, Ortega repeatedly spoke both of leading the
Sandinistas as an opposition force in the future and about the
Sandinistas' demand that the Contras demobilize in the transition
period.
   ``There is a calm like those before the storm,'' Ortega said.
``And we have the obligation of avoiding being swept away by the
tempest of civil war.''
   ``The situation in the country is very tense, very
complicated,'' Ortega said.
   He said Contras, fighting the Sandinistas since 981, continue to
attack in Nicaraguan territory ``with the complicity of the
Honduran government and the United States government.''
   About 10,000 Contras, most of their force, are based in Honduran
jungle camps near the Nicaragua border.
   Both Ortega and Mrs. Chamorro have called on the Contras to
demobilize before the inauguration. But rebel leaders have refused,
saying she must first take office and the new government be given
control of the Sandinista People's Army and the Interior Ministry
forces.
   Ortega repeatedly has said the Sandinistas will not do that.
   He said Thursday he could not turn over to UNO weapons of the
army and Interior Ministry.
   ``I don't have any weapons to give up because the weapons belong
to the people,'' Ortega said.
   Ramiro Gurdian, acting president of Nicaragua's most important
private business group, wrote Ortega expressing concern about the
distribution of weapons.
   ``We permit ourselves to remind you that although you are ending
your presidential period, the acts of these last days also will be
judged by history,'' he said.
   The proposed law ``coupled with the handling of weapons by
certain sectors of society place in imminent danger Nicaragua's
incipient democracy and the loss of life of Nicaraguans who would
find themselves totally defenseless physically and legally,'' the
letter said.
   Meanwhile, transition teams for both the 14-party UNO coalition
and the Sandinistas met all day Thursday for talks on the handing
over of power. But neither side would release information on the
talks.
   Mrs. Chamorro left the country Thursday for talks with
Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez in Caracas, presumably
centering on the transition of power. She was then to travel to
Houston for two weeks of physical therapy for a fractured knee.

<HEAD>Stocks Rise on Tokyo Market, Dollar Higher Against Yen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today
climbed despite the continuing appreciation of the U.S. dollar
against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average ended the week at 33,993.12,
up 302.23 points or 0.90 percent. It was the second consecutive
rise this week, following a gain of 328.55 points Thursday.
   During the morning session, Tokyo's principal stock index soared
more than 600 points on spot purchases of index-related issues,
said Yutaka Yoshino, a trader with Nikko Securities.
   In the afternoon, however, that kind of buying disappeared, and
following a slump in the stock futures market, spot issues also
fell, sending the Nikkei down some 300 points, he said.
   Behind the technical factors causing today's stock index to move
wildly up and down, Yoshino said the depreciation of the yen was
continuing to have a negative impact on the market.
   Dealers are generally in agreement that the Bank of Japan will
be forced to raise its discount rate to counteract the inflationary
impact of the cheap yen, an action expected to dampen the demand
for stocks.
   Haruhito Ichimura, of Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru Securities, pointed
out the sensitivity of the stock market to changes in foreign
exchange rates.
   ``To some extent, investors have discounted a possible increase
in the discount rate, but there is some uncertainty because no one
knows whether the rise will 0.5 percent 1.0 percent,'' he said.
   ``The foreign exchange rate is the biggest problem (facing the
market). It will have a tremendous impact on stocks,'' Ichimura
said.
   On the exchange market, the dollar closed at 151.15 yen, up 0.32
yen. It started trading today at 151.07 yen and ranged between 151
and 151.40 yen.
   A dealer with Fuji Bank, who asked not to be identified, said
dollar buying dominated the morning session, pushing up the U.S.
currency as far as 151.40 yen.
   But small-scale intervention by the Bank of Japan stopped the
depreciation of the yen, she said.
   There was little movement in foreign exchange trading during the
afternoon, the trader remarked. Many dealers were waiting for the
announcement of U.S. employment statistics due out in Washington
later today, she said.
   Yields on benchmark No. 119 10-year government bonds were quoted
at 7.180 percent at 4 p.m., down from 7.205 percent at the market's
closing Thursday.

<HEAD>Sons Accused of Killing Their Millionaire Father and Mother</HEAD>

   A Hollywood executive and his wife
were gunned down by two sons who stood to inherit more than $10
million, police alleged in announcing one son's arrest and an
international hunt for the other.
   In an eerie twist, the one still at large had co-written a
screenplay _ which his mother helped type _ about a son who kills
his rich parents.
   Lyle Menendez, 22, was arrested Thursday and charged with his
19-year-old brother Erik with the shotgun slaying of his father,
Jose Menendez, and mother, Mary Louis ``Kitty'' Menendez.
   The couple were slain in August while watching television in
their Beverly Hills mansion.
   ``I've been in this business 33 years and I've heard of few
killings as savage as this one,'' said Police Chief Marvin D.
Iannone said.
   Police were seeking help from the State Department and Interpol
to detain Erik Menendez, believed to be in Israel playing in a
tennis tournament.
   Jose Menendez, a 45-year-old Cuban immigrant, was chairman of
Live Entertainment Inc., a video and music distribution business
affiliated with Carolco Pictures Inc., producers of the ``Rambo''
movies.
   Investigators dismissed earlier speculation that organized crime
was behind the slayings because of alleged business links to
Menendez' company.
   Iannone said the investigation uncovered physical evidence that
linked the sons to the killings. The probe also focused on a
vanished computer record concerning Menendez' will.
   Menendez and his wife were killed by shotgun blasts at close
range as they watched television in their library one evening.
Their sons reported the killings, saying they found the bodies
after a night out.
   Nothing appeared to be stolen from the Spanish-style, $5 million
home. And nothing indicated that the killers forced their way in.
   ``The focus became very clear over the past few months that the
sons did it,'' Iannone said. ``We were just waiting for the glue,
binding it together.''
   Police on Thursday served search warrants to seize the records
of a psychologist who had worked with the Menendez family. Some
forms of communication between psychotherapists and their clients
are protected under law. It wasn't known what records were seized
by police.
   Authorities Thursday refused to give a possible motive in the
killings.
   ``Who knows what really goes on in families?'' Iannone said.
   Under terms of the parents' 9-year-old wills, the sons share an
estate worth $10 million to $17 million. A $400,000 life insurance
policy also has been distributed to the sons.
   In the months after the killings, Lyle Menendez traveled the
country, making investments and buying stores, particularly
fast-food franchises, said Iannone.
   Lyle Menendez was arrested Thursday afternoon as he was
preparing to drive away from the family mansion. He had been under
surveillance for 36 hours, and police feared he would leave the
state.
   Erik and a close friend had written a screenplay about a son who
murders his wealthy parents and three other people and ultimately
is shot himself, the Los Angeles Times reported today.
   The screenplay, called ``Friends,'' opens with the son reading
the family will, which bequeaths to him $157 million, before he
goes into his parents' luxury suite and kills them.

<HEAD>No Lie: Honesty Campaign Didn't Make Everyone Honest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETH GRACE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 14-month campaign to make honesty a city
policy ends today, and its leader and police say they cannot tell a
lie: It hasn't rid the city of liars, cheats or scoundrels.
   ``We haven't wiped out crime or made everybody honest, but we
have made people think about it. That's what we intended to do,''
said Jeb Stuart Magruder, the former Watergate conspirator who led
the ``Take an Honest Look'' campaign.
   The privately financed $35,000 campaign in this Midwestern city
of 566,000 closes today with a speech by Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young
and an awards ceremony honoring those whose honesty was exemplary.
   The guest list excludes those responsible for an increase in
crime in Columbus last year. Homicides rose by 29 percent from
1988, car thefts by 22 percent and aggravated assaultsby 5 percent.
   Bank robberies dropped 50 percent last year, but already this
year robbers have held up 33 banks, compared with 54 all of last
year.
   Deputy Chief Robert Kern said neither he nor the street patrol
officers he oversees have noticed an outbreak of honesty.
   ``Crime is up, that's for sure,'' he said. ``But I haven't
noticed any more people than normal being honest. A lot of people
call us with information or turn people in, but they've always done
that.''
   The idea for the campaign surfaced when the honesty _ or lack of
it _ of Columbus residents was questioned in 1988 after the rear
doors of an armored car flew open, spewing bags of cash on an
interstate.
   Many motorists who stopped to scoop up the flying cash never
returned it, although one man who returned $57,000 became a local
celebrity.
   The all-volunteer campaign initiated by the Columbus Commission
on Ethics and Values targeted city schools, churches, government
and city groups. Its chief weapon against dishonesty was public
service announcements.
   The television and radio spots, for example, showed a driver who
backs into an unoccupied vehicle in a parking lot. He, of course,
leaves a note explaining what happened. Another person gets too
much change from a store clerk and gives it back.
   But Magruder, a Presbyterian minister, said the campaign's
biggest success was an honesty curriculum in area school districts.
It spread sincerity to 90,000 Columbus school students through
workshops, essay contests and other programs.
   ``I think it had an effect,'' said Howard Merriman, Columbus
schools assistant superintendent. ``It heightened the awareness of
teachers and administrators that it's important to talk about
honesty. It also helped the students.''
   Other events included a symposium for corporate leaders and
``Honesty Sunday'' at churches.
   Andrew Altman, a philosophy professor at George Washington
University in Washington, D.C., who specializes in law and
morality, said it will take more than a campaign to persuade people
that honesty is the best policy.
   ``Most people are honest most of the time,'' he said in a
telephone interview. ``Restoring ethics and honesty will take a
general cultural transformation about what we think is important in
life ... a return to a life of simple virtues.''
   Magruder, who spent seven months in prison after he admitted
destroying records and committing perjury in the Watergate scandal,
said he saw the campaign as making a small inroad into the problem.
   ``I have learned that change can occur in little increments. And
change for the better is something worth doing,'' he said.
   Magruder said the commission is so satisfied with the effort
that it plans to target another topic come fall _ prejudice.

<HEAD>Whites, Blacks Meet in Program Designed to Break Racial Barriers</HEAD>

   In a program designed to break racial barriers,
eight white college students are spending spring break at the
nation's largest all-black Catholic school.
   ``We grow up in two totally different societies, and there's a
lot of fear on both sides,'' said Sister Helen Strueder of Holy
Angels School. ``Working one-on-one breaks down that barrier.''
   Sister Ann Redig, director of campus ministry at Quincy College
in western Illinois, where the white college students come from,
organized the trip as ``an opportunity for students who wanted to
do some kind of service.''
   ``One of the biggest objectives is to open the eyes and broaden
the horizons of the students I work with,'' she said.
   Quincy students spend their weeklong spring break, which started
Saturdy, tutoring and teaching students who are in preschool
through eighth grade.
   The program, in its second year, is unusual for inner-city
schools, said Sister Strueder, who hopes it will produce the added
benefit of becoming a source for white teachers.
   She said three Quincy students have already asked to work this
summer as tutors at Holy Angels, a school with an excellent
scholastic reputation that has a long waiting list.
   Meghan Hanrahan, a sophomore, said she came to Holy Angels
because ``as a potential social worker, I wanted to get out and
meet some of the people I someday hope to help out in some way.''
   The school is in a downtrodden South Side neighborhood.
   Since her arrival, Hanrahan _ who grew up in Buffalo, N.Y., and
St. Louis _ said she'd seen a drug deal and heard gunshots in the
night. ``You know what's going on, but you rarely see it like I
have this week.''
   From the elementary students, Hanrahan said: ``All they want to
hear is what's college like. `Do you get to stay in dorms? Do you
get a lot of homework?'''
   Seventh-grader Victoria Williams said ``it's been an
inspiration'' to have the college students around: ``You see the
way they act and talk so nice _ maybe we'll do the same.''
   Each morning, Victoria dons a brown plaid school uniform and
commutes across the South Side on a city bus to Holy Angels, which
according to Sister Strueder, is the largest black Catholic school
in the country with an enrollment of 1,250 students.
   ``My mother says this is a very nice school and she wants me to
come here. She just thinks this is the best school for me,'' said
Victoria, who plans to go to college.
   As she tutored Victoria in division and mixed fractions, Junior
Kathy Bianchi said that after a week at Holy Angels: ``You just
learn to see through color.''

<HEAD>Key Party Meeting Reportedly In Session</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party's Central Committee is
believed to have begun a key meeting to decide economic and
personnel matters before the nation's parliament convenes later
this month, diplomats said today.
   The committee would be meeting for the first time since
November, when the decision-making body approved a three-year
economic austerity program and announced that senior leader Deng
Xiaoping was resigning from his last party post.
   There was no official confirmation of the party meeting,
although the street in front of the Great Hall of the People was
blocked off this morning, an indication that an important event was
taking place inside.
   Some diplomats said the meeting appeared to have opened today,
while others said it started on Thursday.
   The Central Committee, composed of 175 regular and 108 alternate
members, usually meets twice a year, once before the annual session
of the National People's Congress, China's rubberstamp legislature.
   The meeting is likely to focus on the nation's troubled economy
and policies to be outlined by Premier Li Peng before the People's
Congress.
   The austerity program has brought down inflation and curbed
excessive economic growth, but has also resulted in the closures of
thousands of factories and the layoffs of millions of workers.
   The party, concerned about popular unrest because of the
economic downturn and the harsh political climate following the
military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in June, is
expected to approve some easing of austerity measures, particularly
the loosening of credit to money-starved industries.
   The party meeting will also take up personnel changes to be
approved by People's Congress.
   The Central Committee is also likely to discuss the rapid
political and economic changes taking place in the Soviet Union and
East Europe, and reaffirm China's position that it will continue
along the socialist road regardless of events in other countries.
   Diplomats said the meeting will probably last until early next
week. Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin is scheduled to
leave in the middle of the week on a trip to North Korea.

<HEAD>Texas Democrats Meet in Gubernatorial Debate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ann Richards again refused to say whether she'd
used illegal drugs, an issue that has hurt her campaign against six
other Democrats for the gubernatorial nomination.
   Ms. Richards, a recovering alcoholic, said during a debate with
her Democratic rivals Thursday night that the issue had never been
raised in her eight years as treasurer.
   But the drug question has become an acid test for the Democratic
candidates. Richards' refusal to answer apparently is behind her
recent drop in the polls.
   The polls show former Gov. Mark White leading Ms. Richards, who
in turn leads Jim Mattox, the state attorney general. Ms. Richards
came to national prominence when she delivered the keynote address
during the 1988 Democratic convention.
   White, Mattox and four minor candidates have said they never
used illegal drugs. White and Mattox offered to take a drug test
before the primary on Tuesday.
   White and Mattox both took Ms. Richards to task over a new
series of advertisements that question their financial dealings and
integrity.
   ``Ann, you know better than what you've been saying on
television, you know it's a lie,'' White said.
   ``I think your advertising now is in really poor taste,'' Mattox
said.
   One candidate with little backing, Stanley Edward Adams Jr.,
criticized the others for hammering Ms. Richards on the drug
question. ``Too many people right now are trying to destroy this
lady. Well, we are overreacting,'' he said.
   Adams said he favored decriminalizing drug use.
   Extra security was arranged for Ms. Richards when she arrived
back in Austin on Thursday night, after someone made two telephone
death threats against her from an Austin pay phone, police said.
   In another development, the Rev. W.N. Otwell, a candidate with a
small following, withdrew from the GOP gubernatorial race Thursday
night and endorsed Republican front-runner Clayton Williams.
   The winner of the general election will succeed retiring
Republican Gov. Bill Clements.

   With a healthy lead in the polls for
Tuesday's Republican primary for governor, the folksy humor is
oozing out of Clayton Williams like the oil that made his fortune.
   The other GOP candidates seem well out of hollering range, and
Williams was confident enough of victory to skip a televised League
of Women Voters' debate Wednesday night in Dallas.
   He seemed to be enjoying himself as he made the rounds Thursday,
kissing small children and signing autographs with his wife,
Modesta.
   ``Take a good look at me, look at my profile. Now look at
Modesta,'' he said. ``You think I'm not the sellingest son-of-a-gun
you've ever seen?''
   Recent polls have shown Williams winning about 50 percent of the
GOP vote. He was asked Thursday if he thought he could avoid a
runoff election for the nomination to succeed retiring Republican
Gov. Bill Clements.
   ``As a Republican, it would be much better for our party if I
were able to make it without a runoff,'' Williams said. ``We are
asking all our supporters to please walk that extra block, please
call on that extra house, please make that extra phone call.''
   Then he flashed a grin and said: ``I must be sounding like a
politician. I circled that question pretty good.''
   The colorful West Texas oilman-rancher, never before elected to
public office, has sunk $5.6 million of his own money in an $8
million campaign that appears to have succeeded in creating a look
and feel that appeals to Texans.
   In the extensive TV ads that have bolstered his campaign, the
cowboy hat never leaves Williams' head. He tells fans that he owns
no shoes _ just boots _ and professes to worship the late John
Wayne.
   ``John Wayne was a dream of what we all wished we were rather
than what any of us mortals are,'' Williams told a incredulous
out-of-town reporter. ``The good guy who whipped the bad guy, who
was on the side of right, law and order.''
   Williams' nearest opponent, Kent Hance, a former Democratic
congressman who sponsored President Reagan's 1981 tax cut
legislation, had 22 percent support in a recent poll.
   The two other major contenders have earned most of the
endorsements from the state's major newspapers. But both _ Tom
Luce, lawyer for billionaire H. Ross Perot, and former secretary of
state Jack Rains _ remain in single digits in the polls.

<HEAD>Government Will Ban Over-the-Counter Prostate Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration says it will
ban the sale of all nonprescription drugs used to treat enlargement
of the prostate gland.
   The agency said Thursday that its review of these products found
little evidence any of them eliminates, arrests or treats the
condition, called benign prostatic hypertrophy.
   Surgery is currently the only effective treatment, the FDA said.
   The condition causes enlargement of the male gland, which can
obstruct the flow of urine, create back pressure in the kidneys and
cause urinary tract infections that are difficult to treat, the FDA
said.
   The over-the-counter products, which contain the amino acids
glycine, alanine and glutamic acid and a plant extract called
sabal, can relieve some symptoms of the condition. However, their
use also could lull men with the condition ``into a sense of false
security,'' which could delay their getting proper treatment, the
agency said.
   Few of these products are being sold today, the FDA said.
   About 50 percent to 80 percent of men with the condition will
develop unstable bladders and have symptoms of frequency and
urgency of urination.
   The FDA said the ban will take effect in six months.

<HEAD>Group Wants Anti-Smoking Spots to Balance Sports Sponsors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A children's advocacy group has asked
regulators to require broadcasters and cable TV operators to show
anti-smoking messages on youth-oriented programs if they televise
sports events sponsored by cigarette companies.
   Action for Children's Television, which was instrumental in
reviving advertising limits for Saturday morning children's TV
shows, on Thursday appealed to the Federal Communications
Commission to close a ``loophole'' in a 1969 law that banned
cigarette advertising from television.
   The group said cigarette companies got around the ban by
sponsoring televised sports events such as tennis tournaments and
car races and making their brands part of the names of the events.
   TV cameras also routinely show billboards advertising cigarettes
behind the sports action being shown, ACT said, calling them
``hidden commercials'' that subvert the purpose of the 1969 law.
   Congress passed the law ``because it had concluded that it is
not in the public interest to have cigarettes advertised over such
unique media that reach into every household and are particularly
viewed by the young,'' ACT told the FCC.
   ``The young are being bombarded over television by hidden
messages associated with sports ... that are meant to show that
smoking is attractive,'' ACT President Peggy Charren said in an
interview.

<HEAD>USDA Defends Flexibility Proposal, But Concedes Grain Prices Could</HEAD>

</TEXT>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat-state lawmakers say a Bush
administration proposal to give farmers more planting options could
hurt farmers by creating lower crop prices.
   The Agriculture Department defended the proposal on Thursday
before a Senate Agriculture subcommittee, but conceded that wheat
prices probably would drop initially if farmers nationwide were
given more flexibility in choosing which crops they grow.
   Bruce Gardner, USDA assistant secretary for economics, projected
that up to 3 million additional wheat acres would be planted if the
administration's proposal were implemented in 1991. Wheat prices
could fall as much as 15-20 cents a bushel, he said.
   Wheat prices are projected to average $3.80 to $3.90 a bushel in
the 1990 crop year, according to USDA.
   However, Gardner said ``wheat producers are going to be
protected'' by federal subsidies from a drop in their incomes.
Overall, he contended that farmers would benefit from more planting
flexibility because they could adjust their cropping patterns to
take advantage of potential higher prices in the markets.
   At issue is a proposal by President Bush for more planting
flexibility for farmers who wish to participate in federal subsidy
programs.
   The lawmakers said they generally agreed with the goal but
differed with the administration on how best to accomplish it. The
proposal is part of the administration's recommendations for new
farm legislation to guide agricultural policy during the next
several years.

   A doctor settled a lawsuit that claimed she
contracted AIDS though the negligence of another doctor, for she
doubted that she would live long enough to see through a promised
appeal.
   Dr. Veronica Prego, who claimed she contracted the deadly
disease in 1983 after she accidently pricked her finger on a needle
that had been used to draw blood from an AIDS patient, said she was
relieved the case against the city was settled.
   In another case Thursday, a jury in Columbus, Ohio, awarded $12
million to Holly Sutro Lalonde, who was infected with acquired
immune deficiency syndrome during a hospital-administered blood
transfusion in 1985.
   Also Thursday, Ronald Lovgren, 26, was ordered released from
jail in Syracuse, N.Y., after a private company that transports
prisoners around the country refused to return him to Florida
because he has AIDS. Lovgren walked away from a prison detail in
Florida 40 days before his sentence was completed.
   Under the agreement reached in Brooklyn state Supreme Court,
none of the parties named in Prego's lawsuit acknowledged guilt.
The settlement, the amount of which was not disclosed, was reached
as attorneys prepared trial summations.
   Jurors interviewed afterward said they were leaning in favor of
the 32-year-old doctor.
   Prego's lawyer, Diane Wilner, said the settlement was
reluctantly accepted because the defense said it would appeal any
jury victory by Prego.
   ``In essence, I believe they put a gun to our head with the
appeal,'' she said.
   An appeal would tie the matter up in the courts for two to three
years. Prego's doctor had testified she might have less than a year
to live.
   Prego, pale and looking tired during the trial, said she was
happy the trial had finally ended.
   ``It's been extremely difficult for me,'' she said, complaining
that her health had worsened because of the strain of the more than
2-month-long trial. ``Now it's time to take care of myself.''
   New York City's Health and Hospitals Corp. will pay the
settlement, which Justice Aaron D. Bernstein ordered both sides not
to disclose, although he said it was ``between zero and $100
million.'' Prego had sought $175 million.
   ``It's no one's business, except the people who are paying it
and the person who's receiving it,'' Bernstein said. ``It has
nothing to do with the relative merits of this case.''
   City lawyer Stanley D. Friedman said of the settlement, ``We're
most pleased, I can't tell you the numbers, but we're most
pleased.''
   In her suit filed in 1988, Prego charged that while working as
an unpaid doctor in training at Kings County Hospital on Jan. 12,
1983, she was injured by an AIDS-contaminated needle carelessly
left on a bed by her supervising intern.

   Investigators believe a loose motor under a
subway car tripped a switch that threw part of the train into
another track and slammed it into a pillar, killing three people
and injuring 94.
   A nut holding the motor in place had apparently slipped off,
causing the motor to drag under the six-car train before
Wednesday's accident, John K. Lauber of the National Transportation
Safety Board said Thursday.
   The motor, under the third car, hit a crossover switch, and the
tripped switch jerked the last three cars onto a second set of
tracks. The fourth car smashed into a steel pillar, Lauber said.
All of the dead were in the fourth car.
   The accident was the worst in the 21 years the Southeastern
Pennsylvania Transportation Authority has operated the regional
commuter system.
   A 37-block section of the subway and elevated train line in the
nation's fifth-largest city remained closed today as the
investigation of the site continued.
   Sixteen people were still hospitalized, two in critical or
serious condition.
   Lauber said the NTSB learned Thursday of three other incidents
in the past 15 years when a motor apparently dropped. One occurred
just six months ago, he said.
   A nut and cotter pin came off a vertical bolt on the motor in
Wednesday's crash and there was extensive damage to horizontal bars
on the car, which were supposed to catch the motor if it fell,
Lauber said.
   Lauber said the NTSB was also told that the same motor had been
replaced on Oct. 4, and had been in the shop for routine
inspections in February.
   The regional transporation authority has ordered inspections of
all older subway cars, which date from the early 1960s.
   An extra 120 buses were pressed into service to shuttle some of
the 100,000 passengers who ride the trains each day. The closed
section of track was expected to reopen Monday.
   Gov. Robert P. Casey inspected the accident area Thursday and
asked for more federal help for the transit authority, which
recently proposed raising the base fare to $1.50 _ the highest in
the country _ to try to head off a $30 million deficit in the next
fiscal year.
   But in Washington, Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said:
``SEPTA can no longer run the risk of assuming that we're going to
have a continuous federal income stream because that prevents them
from living up to their responsibility.''

   A tax-free charitable trust set up by the Rev.
Bruce Ritter in Covenant House's name did not file annual reports
two years with the Internal Revenue Service as the law requires, an
IRS spokesman said.
   The trust was set up in 1983 to aid runaway youths, but Covenant
House officials acknowledged money from the trust instead went into
loans to Father Ritter's sister and two Covenant House board
members.
   It also paid $140,000 to Ritter, some of which he said he
returned, the New York Times reported today.
   No reports were filed with the IRS in 1987 and 1988, said
spokesman Robert Kobel. He said a search for earlier filings was
continuing.
   The trust never registered with the charities bureau of the
state Attorney General's office either, new Times said.
   Ritter resigned as president of Covenant House after four young
men who had sought his help alleged that he had sexual affairs with
them.

<HEAD>Najib Says Pakistan Had Major Role In Attempted Coup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON HERBAUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghanistan today accused neighboring
Pakistan of playing a major role in a thwarted coup engineered by
the Afghan defense minister, who defected to a Moslem guerrilla
faction.
   Pakistan called the allegation absurd, saying the plot to topple
Afghan President Najib only exposed the cracks in his shaky
government in Kabul.
   At least 56 people died and 200 others were injured in Tuesday's
revolt by soldiers loyal to the renegade defense minister, Gen.
Shah Nawaz Tanai. Tanai was supported by fundamentalist guerrilla
leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.
   Tanai, a battle-hardened officer popular among the rank-and-file
military, was dismissed as defense minister shortly after Afghan
warplanes swooped down and bombed the capital of Kabul, causing
extensive damage to the city of 2 million.
   Najib also replaced Tanai and other key members of the
policy-making Politburo, the Central Committee and the Supreme
Defense Council, which maps out the government's strategy in the
12-year-old war against the Moslem guerrillas.
   Among those dismissed from the Politburo were Said Mohammad
Gulabzhoi, Afghanistan's ambassador to Moscow, and Gen. Abdul Qadar
Aga Aka, a leader of the air force contingents that helped Mohammad
Daoud overthrow the monarchy in 1973. Daoud was killed in the 1978
coup that installed the Communist government.
   During a news conference Thursday in Kabul, Najib declared his
government had been purged of dissidents and that his ruling
People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan was now more united than
ever.
   ``The microbes, the radicals among us, have been cleansed,'' a
Kabul-based diplomat quoted the 43-year-old president as saying.
The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, reported the government had
proof that neighboring Pakistan played a key role in Tanai's
attempts to bring down Najib, the former chief of the feared secret
police who was installed by the Soviets in 1986.
   ``The government of Afghanistan has undeniable documents of
Pakistan's interference and participation in the unsuccessful
coup,'' official Kabul Radio said.
   ``The government demands that Pakistan hand over Shah Nawaz
Tanai and others who escaped to Pakistan,'' said the radio,
monitored in Islamabad.
   The Soviet-backed government regularly accuses Pakistan of
training the Moslem guerrillas, who are armed by the United States
and Saudi Arabia.
   As it has always done, Pakistan denied the charge.
   ``This (coup attempt) is an internal matter. It ... shows that
the government's claim of popular support is just a sham,'' said a
Foreign Ministry spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Tanai fled Afghanistan on Wednesday, and Pakistani officials and
guerrilla sources said he then defected to the guerrillas, whom he
fought more than a decade. Tanai returned to Afghanistan, but his
exact whereabouts were not known.
   
   Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami has split from the other six groups in
the Pakistan-based resistance over leadership disputes. Leaders of
the guerrillas' government-in-exile say they would never accept
Tanai, a hard-line Communist, as an ally.
   Tanai and Hekmatyar, bitter rivals during the 12-year-old war,
apparently were united in their desire to see Najib ousted.
   While the plot apparently failed, Western diplomats in Pakistan
said, it still hurt Najib politically and militarily and bought
time for the guerrillas preparing for the so-called summer fighting
season.
   With planes diverted to Kabul from other areas, Western
diplomats said, the guerrillas are now able to move weapons into
Afghanistan.
   The Afghan air force has been credited for Najib's survival
since the Kremlin ended nine years of direct military intervention
and pulled the Red Army out of Afghanistan in February 1989. Najib,
former chief of the feared secret police, was installed by the
Soviets in 1986.

<HEAD>Va. Governor Likely To Sign Anti-Smoking Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Virginia, one of the biggest
tobacco-producing states in the country, is poised to become one of
the last states to pass a public smoking bill.
   The state legislature on Thursday approved a bill restricting
smoking, and Gov. L. Douglas Wilder is likely to sign it, said
Wilder's chief of staff, J.T. Shropshire.
   Virginia is among six states with no statewide limits on smoking
in public. It is the nation's fifth largest tobacco producer.
   ``I think we can live with it,'' said Anthony F. Troy, a
lobbyist for the Tobacco Institute.
   ``It is a major, positive step toward cleaner air in the
commonwealth,'' said Jane F. Roberts, a spokeswoman for the
Tri-Agency Council, a coalition of cancer, heart and lung
associations.
   But rural lawmakers called the bill another blow to the
declining tobacco industry.
   ``We are talking about an industry that has helped build this
commonwealth,'' said Delegate Charles R. Hawkins. ``This vote will
change the direction of this commonwealth forever.''
   Delegate Willard R. Finney said the number of tobacco farmers in
his county has declined from 1,200 in 1980 to 200 today.
   ``Unfortunately, the tobacco farmer doesn't have any lobbying
group down here,'' Finney said.
   The bill would ban smoking in elevators, school buses, hospital
emergency rooms, school common areas, polling places and indoor
cashier lines.
   It would also require no-smoking areas in state offices,
restaurants with 50 or more seats, retail stores of 15,000 square
feet or more and educational and health care buildings.
   In a compromise with tobacco industry backers, the bill allows
localities to regulate smoking in other public places but would
limit how strict their ordinances could be. In private workplaces,
localities could allow smoking to be banned if half the employees
agree.

   The baseball players' union dismissed an offer
by Commissioner Fay Vincent's to open training camps in exchange
for a no-strike pledge by players.
   ``We are not, unless there is some miracle, going to resolve
this in the next several days,'' Vincent said Thursday night after
the players' union denounced the proposal he made earlier in the
day.
   Negotiations to end the baseball owners' lockout remained stuck
over salary arbitration 24 days before opening day. Both sides have
agreed that players must be in camp by Monday if the season is to
start as scheduled April 2.
   ``I guess we've been naive enough to keep thinking we're going
to reach an agreement,'' American League President Bobby Brown said.
   The sides talked into the night on Wednesday. The owners met
Thursday and weren't interested in the union's plan. Vincent then
made his announcement.
   ``I am asking the clubs to open the training camps in exchange
for a pledge from the players not to strike during the 1990 season.
In the meantime, the parties can continue to work toward the best
of all results ... a negotiated agreement,'' Vincent said.
   Union chief Donald Fehr, at a news conference an hour later,
dismissed Vincent's idea as ``silly.''
   Added Eugene Orza, a union counsel: ``No self-respecting union
would give up its right to strike.''

<HEAD>Rain Over Gulf States; Wet Weather Out West for Weekend</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   Scattered rainshowers soaked much of the area east of the
Mississippi River early today, and a weekend forecast called for
spring-like weather in the East and rain in the West.
   In Des Moines, Iowa, utility crews restored power to thousands
of homes in the wake of this week's ice storm, but officials said
some may be without power until Sunday. About 30,000 customers were
still without electricity early today.
   The rain that fell from Minneapolis to Birmingham, Ala., today
was the tail end of a storm that dumped snow and freezing rain in
the Rockies earlier in the week.
   A warm front approached the Northwest, while weak storms from
the Pacific Ocean were expected to bring rain this weekend to the
coastal states and possibly snow to the Rockies.
   On Thursday, Arkansas was swamped overnight with as much as 7
inches of rain that forced evacuations in at least five counties,
washed out roads and bridges in more than 10 counties and left a
school bus with 46 young passengers stuck in wheel-high water for
two hours. No one was seriously injured.
   The National Weather Service forecast says it's possible that
showers will return tonight in Arkansas and last through Sunday.
   In Illinois and Iowa, tornadoes touched down in several spots,
and damaged two apartment buildings, an office and cars in the Iowa
City suburb of Coralville, police said. No major injuries were
reported.
   Thunderstorms also brought hail in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and in
parts of Illinois.
   In Cheyenne, Wyo., unseasonably warm temperatures melted snow
and caused some flooding in the city.
   High temperature records for March 8 were set in Billings,
Mont., 64 degrees; and Glasgow, Mont., 63 degrees; and Sherdian,
Wyo., 64 degrees.
   Rain fell Thursday night along the Oregon and Washington coasts
as well as in southeast Idaho. Freezing rain fell in parts of
Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan.
   The nation's high temperature Thursday was 91 degrees at
McAllen, Texas.

   Five veteran mushers vied for the lead near
the midway point of the 18th annual Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.
   Lavon Barve of Wasilla was the first to arrive at the checkpoint
here Thursday. Barve, who has finished in the top 10 each of the
past four years, mushed in at 10:21 a.m. and was the first musher
out six hours later.
   Barve was followed by Martin Buser of Big Lake; three-time champ
Susan Butcher of Manley; defending champion Joe Runyan of Nenana
and DeeDee Jonrowe of Willow.
   The lead mushers were all into McGrath within an hour of each
other, and were gone by 4:34 p.m. _ within 20 minutes of Barve _ en
route for Cripple, 60 miles up the trail and the midway point in
the 1,160 mile race to Nome from Anchorage, which the 70 sled teams
left Saturday.
   The first musher in Cripple captures a halfway trophy and $3,000
in silver ingots provided by a race sponsor. But race lore has it
that few leaders at Cripple ever go on to win.
   Earlier in the day front-runner Rick Swenson was knocked back
after encountering moose on the trail out of McGrath.
   After some of his dogs were trampled, Swenson returned to
McGrath to wait for daylight. The run-in dropped him to seventh and
he arrived Thursday night in Ophir, nearly two hours behind the
leader.

<HEAD>Economic Crisis Drives Slumdwellers To Attack Delivery Trucks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungry residents blocked roads or
threw rocks in an attempt to get food delivery trucks to stop in
slums in the northern city of Rosario. Police fired rubber bullets
at the people.
   A 14-year-old boy was shot in the leg and five people were
struck by the rubber bullets, reported police in Rosario, an
industrial city of 1 million about 185 miles north of Buenos Aires.
Twenty people were arrested.
   Rosario was the site of the worst violence when food riots broke
out in several cities in May. At least 16 people were killed in
those riots.
   The cost of living has soared an estimated 12,000 percent the
past 12 months, and wages have failed to keep pace. Compared to the
dollar, Argentina's currency is worth less than 1 percent what it
was a year ago.
   Dozens of ``misery town'' dwellers, as Argentines call the
neighborhoods, gathered before dawn Thursday at highways and tried
to block the roads with tree branches and wooden posts, the
Noticias Argentinas independent news agency reported.
   When trucks and even cars slowed down, the shantytown residents
hurled rocks trying to get them to stop, police said.
   A 14-year-old boy was shot in the leg and five other people were
struck by rubber bullets, police in Rosario reported.
   Police Gen. Fermin Almonacid said the majority of the 20
arrested were ``common delinquents'' taking advantage of a social
situation made explosive by high inflation, increasing
unemployment, shrinking wages and hunger.
   About one adult out of five works part-time or not at all.
   Border guards and federal police have patrolled downtown streets
almost continually in Rosario since December.
   But neighborhood grocery stores and food delivery trucks still
have been looted almost daily for weeks, despite the distribution
of thousands of packages containing cooking oil, powdered milk,
noodles, sugar, tea and other basics.
   In an indication the unrest may be spreading, women and children
walked into two supermarkets Thursday, filled bags with food and
fled.
   Noticias Argentinas said one merchant, seeing people gather
outside, gave away bags of rice, noodles and other food to keep his
store from being looted.
   Newspapers and an economic research group reported Thursday that
the cost of living in Argentina rose by at least 62 percent last
month and may reach triple digits in March.
   The daily La Nacion, citing unidentified government sources, put
February inflation at 62 to 70 percent. Even the lower figure would
mean the cost of living for the past 12 months rose by 12,231
percent.
   Inflation in 1989 was 4,924 percent, wildly fluctuating from a
high of 197 percent in July to a low of 5.6 percent in October.
   Economists and monetary experts say that despite five major
austerity plans implemented during the 8-month-old government of
President Carlos Menem, inflation may worsen before it gets better.

   Tired and miffed that she had to undergo a
second liver transplant, the world's only surviving heart-liver
transplant patient says she wants to go home, take a bath and go to
bed.
   ``I thought I wasn't going to have anymore problems again, but I
guess I was wrong,'' said Stormie Jones, 12, during a news
conference Thursday at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.
   Cuddling a stuffed koala bear that accompanied her to the
operating room last month, Stormie said she hopes to return home to
White Settlement, Texas, within a month.
   Stormie said she's forcing herself to obey doctors' orders and
take short strolls around the hospital so she can return home soon.
   ``I guess it's just hope,'' she said of her ordeal. ``There's a
thing in the back of your head that says, `Get up,'''
   Stormie, dressed in sweat pants and a Children's Hospital sweat
shirt, teasingly sparred with her mother, Lois ``Susie'' Purcell,
during the news conference. Speaking softly, she professed her
dislike for being in the public eye and media interviews, her fate
since the second transplant on Feb. 20.
   Although she and her mother are optimistic her body will accept
the new liver, Stormie said there's a remote chance of rejection.
   ``They told me I might be having a little rejection, which made
me mad,'' she said.
   Mrs. Purcell said she credits Stormie's seemingly fast recovery
to FK-506, an experimental anti-rejection drug developed in Japan.
Stormie began taking it in November.
   Researchers say the drug is more powerful and causes fewer side
effects than cyclosporine, the anti-rejection medicine Stormie
began taking after her historic heart-liver transplant on Feb. 14,
1984.
   Stormie required a second liver last month because the first
transplanted liver was permanently damaged by hepatitis.
   The day after her second transplant, Stormie returned to the
operating room because of internal bleeding.
   ``I thought, `Now what are you taking out,''' Stormie said.
   Stormie has been playing with other children at the hospital,
reading books and building a wooden doll house.
   She said she also is trying to write a book for other children
about her experiences but so far has completed only a page, in part
because she doesn't like to write.
   Her first transplant was needed to control effects of a rare
disease that left her cholesterol levels 10 times greater than
normal and damaged her heart.
   Her donor heart has remained healthy, doctors said.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed In Thin Trading, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed in thin European trading this
morning, trapped between bullish sentiment and fears of central
bank intervention.
   The pound fell sharply on rumors that Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher had resigned. Mrs. Thatcher's Downing Street office denied
the rumors. A spokesman, who wasn't identified, in accordance with
British practice, called them ``utter rubbish.''
   Gold prices were lower.
   Traders predicted the dollar would remain trapped in its current
narrow range for the near future and said they doubted the release
of U.S. employment figures later in the day would nudge it out of
its current levels unless the figures are way outside expectations.
   ``The central banks have achieved what everyone hoped they
wouldn't: stability,'' said Manfred Totzauer, a senior trader at
Citibank AG in Frankfurt.
   In London, the pound fell to $1.6267 dollars from $1.6427
dollars late Thursday.
   Dealers said the Bank of England stepped in to provide support
for the pound, with little impact.
   Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative government has come under
widespread attack for the introduction of a new tax called the
community charge next month.
   Over the last few days, increasingly violent demonstrations have
interrupted city council proceedings throughout the country.
   At the same time, there has been increasing concern over the
government's handling of the economy. Despite 15 percent interest
rates, inflation, running at an annual rate of 7.7 percent, is
expected to climb as high as 9 percent in the next month or two.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Thursday:
   _ 1.7007 West German marks, down from 1.7015
   _ 1.5085 Swiss francs, up from 1.5080
   _ 5.75 French francs, down from 5.7525
   _ 1.9120 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9164
   _ 1,256 Italian lire, up from 1,255.75
   _ 1.18 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1792
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.32 yen to a closing 151.15 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a higher rate of 151.30 yen.
   Bullion dealers said gold trading was thin as the market waited
for the release of the U.S. employment figures and further
direction from the dollar.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $400.40 a troy ounce,
down from $401.95 bid late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $399.70.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $400.40, down from $400.75 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.29 to close at a bid $400.75.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.11 a troy ounce, from
Thursday's $5.15.

   Lithuanian nationalists said today their
republic's legislature still plans to vote this weekend on whether
to secede from the Soviet Union, contradicting an early report that
the move had been postponed.
   Lionginas Vasilyauskas, spokesman for the Sajudis people's
movement, said the Supreme Soviet legislature will vote on a
declaration of independence Sunday. Sajudis members have a
two-thirds majority in the newly elected legislature.
   He disputed a report by Eduardas Potashinkas, an editor at
Lithuanian government-run television, who said the group's
governing council had decided to put off the vote at a meeting
Thursday night.
   Potashinkas, who has previously supplied accurate information,
said nationalists had dropped plans to vote on a declaration this
weekend and instead seek the proclamation ``in the nearest future.''
   The Lithuanian parliament is scheduled to meet Saturday, with a
secession vote on the original agenda.
   A vote on a proclamation of independence would bring the Baltic
republic into conflict with the Kremlin. President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev had warned this week that Lithuania would own the central
government about $34 billion in convertible currency for
investments made in the 50 years since the Kremlin absorbed the
once-independent state.
   Tass quoted Lithuania's president, Algirdas Brazauskas, as
saying such a payment ``would be an extremely difficult task.''
   Gorbachev reportedly indicated Moscow may demand Lithuania turn
over the port of Klaipeda if allowed to secede, as well as a small
section around Drushinikai in extreme south Lithuania.
   Sajudis, buoyed by its sweeping victories in Lithuania's recent
elections, has decided to force the issue of secession, a right
granted in theory by the Soviet Constitution to each of the
country's 15 republics.
   Pro-secession sentiment in Lithuania has been swelling for
months, but Sajudis moved this week to preempt Gorbachev's plans to
introduce a vastly more powerful presidency with the right to crack
down on restive republics.
   The national Congress of People's Deputies is scheduled to meet
Monday in Moscow to consider the presidency proposal. The latest
Sajudis decision would provide time to work out a compromise
between the Kremlin and representatives from republics like
Lithuania and Georgia who maintain the new presidency would give
Moscow near-dictatorial powers over the republics.
   National lawmakers were meeting in Moscow today in legislative
committees to consider the new presidency, the official Tass news
agency reported. Potashinkas said Lithuania's final course of
action would be ``tightly linked'' to what kind of powers the
Congress confers on Gorbachev.
   A wave of nationalism has swept through the Baltics, the eastern
republic of Moldavia and several southern republics.
   In December, Lithuania's Communist Party became the first to
break away from the central party since the Communists took power
in 1917.
   The national Supreme Soviet legislature is considering a
proposed law that would give the republics the right to secede from
the union. But settling financial issues is just one of a daunting
series of requirements that the republics would have to meet in
order to secede.

<NOTE>EDS: LEADS with 3 grafs with Quayle's departure</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle left today for a
tour of South America, saying he wants to listen rather than
lecture about how the United States can help its hemispheric
neighbors with economic development.
   The vice president's trip revolves around two inaugurations _
Sunday in Chile and March 15 in Brazil. But he also will stop in
Venezuela, Barbados, Argentina and Paraguay for talks on Latin debt
and trade problems and on President Bush's push to win acceptance
for Panama's U.S.-installed government.
   Quayle departed Andrews Air Force Base outside of Washington
shortly after daybreak for the flight to Caracas, Venezuela.
   In briefing foreign reporters on the eve of his departure,
Quayle offered no specifics on what the United States can do to
help the Latin countries with their massive debt and inflation
problems.
   He said he wanted to hear ideas on trade and economic
development from those countries' heads of state.
   ``It's very important to solicit their ideas,'' Quayle said.
``At times the United States gets accused, perhaps justifiably so,
of lecturing. I'm not visiting Latin America to lecture. I'm
visiting Latin America to listen, to get their ideas.''
   He said the administration is prepared to turn its attention
more to economic affairs in the hemisphere, now that democratic
elections have sparked political reform in country after country
previously ruled by dictators.
   ``Political development has been successful in the hemisphere,
but we have not been as successful as we'd like on economic
development,'' Quayle told reporters.
   Two countries Quayle will visit, Brazil and Argentina, are among
the most severely handicapped economically. Brazil's $115 billion
foreign debt is the largest in the developing world.
   Argentina is beset by demonstrations and strikes resulting from
its 8,000 percent inflation rate.
   There has been little progress, except in Mexico, on the Bush
administration's so-called Brady Plan to ease Latin American debt
by getting commercial banks to forgive outstanding loans.
   The other goal of Quayle's trip _ seeking acceptance of the
Panamanian government installed when the U.S. invasion toppled Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega _ still faces resistance.
   Both Chile and Brazil refused to invite Panamanian
representatives to their inaugurations.
   Like other Latin governments, Chile and Brazil condemned the
Dec. 20 invasion as a violation of Panama's sovereignty. Many Latin
governments contend Panama's President Guillermo Endara needs to
gain legitimacy through a vote of Panama's citizens or its congress.
   But U.S. officials insist that the Latin resentment over the
Panama invasion is fading.
   ``We're moving toward hemispheric-wide acceptance of the
Panamanian government, general acceptance. These sorts of things
will be worked out,'' said Quayle's press secretary, David
Beckwith. He noted Endara's recent call for a vote on proposed
changes in the constitution.
   In Brazil, ``It is likely that the new government will examine
the matter in a new light,'' said one Brazilian diplomat, referring
to the upcoming inauguration of Fernando Collor de Mello.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., is accompanying Quayle as part of
the U.S. delegation to the Chile inauguration of Patricio Aylwin.
   Kennedy was a leading critic of human rights violations under
outgoing Chilean President Gen. Agosto Pinochet.
   Quayle will meet with Pinochet, who insisted on retaining
control of the country's 60,000-man army even though he will not be
president.
   Nicaragua's outgoing President Daniel Ortega, defeated in Feb.
25 elections by the U.S.-backed candidate Violeta Chamorro, also
plans to attend the Chile inaugural. While U.S. officials have
refused to meet with Ortega or representatives of his Marxist
regime, the vice president now would have no objections to such a
meeting, said Beckwith. However, he added that Nicaraguan officials
had not sought a meeting.
   Quayle will remain for only a few hours in Venezuela to meet
with President Carlos Andres Perez on regional issues.

   U.S. and Vietnamese specialists have
searched five northern Vietnamese provinces for information on 12
American airmen missing from the Vietnam War, an official report
said.
   The experts examined remains in Ho Chi Minh City after searching
the provinces of Son La, Bac Thai, Tuyen Quang, Hai Hung and
Haiphong, the Vietnam News Agency said in a report dated Thursday
and seen in Bangkok today.
   The report did not say whether the experts had found any
information about the 12 airmen. It said the Feb. 16 to March 6
project was the ninth joint search for missing U.S. soldiers. Past
searhces involved examining plane crash sites and interviewing
villagers who witnessed the crashes.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok earlier said the
U.S. team comprised 14 experts from the Joint Casualty Resolution
Center and the Army Central Identification Laboratory, both of
which are in Hawaii.
   About 2,300 Americans are rpeorted missing in action from the
war, which ended in April 1975 with a Communist defeat of the
U.S.-backed South Vietnam government.

   A cab driver who had racked up a record 119 rule
violations surrendered his license 24 hours before he was to face a
judge at a revocation hearing.
   ``In the future no driver will ever get the chance to approach
the level that he reached,'' Jack Lusk, chairman of the city Taxi
and Limousine Commission, said Thursday, the same day that Vehbi
Gunduz surrendered his hack's license.
   Under the new policy, a cab driver's license can be suspended
after two serious rule violations and revoked after three. And
because of a new point system, licenses could be revoked for a lot
of little violations as well as a few big ones.
   Taxi Commission records showed that over the past four years
Gunduz insulted, bullied and threatened passengers, dispatchers and
inspectors. He overcharged riders, denied them receipts and refused
to take them where they want to go. His cab was filthy, his trunk a
mess, and his hack license was not prominently displayed.
   His lawyer defended him by saying, ``He never has attacked a
member of the public.''
   In surrendering his license, Gunduz agreed not to reapply for
one year. If he reapplies, his application would be reviewed by the
commission's licensing standards committee, Lusk said.

<TEXT>
   The state attorney general declared
West Virginia's first teacher strike illegal, and the governor
declined an offer for a 48-hour cooling off period.
   Attorney General Roger Tompkins Thursday warned teachers they
could be suspended for a year, fired or charged with a misdemeanor
for walking off the job.
   Gov. Gaston Caperton turned down an offer by the state Board of
Education for a 48-hour cooling-off period for him, the Legislature
and teachers. On Wednesday, he said he would not hold talks until
teachers return to the classroom and ``calm and reason are
restored.''
   The strike by the 16,000-member West Virginia Education
Association and the 3,000-member West Virginia Federation of
Teachers began Wednesday after the collapse of a proposed 5 percent
teacher pay raise. Caperton and legislative leaders said they
withdrew the offer when the WVEA refused to back down from a strike
threat.
   Teachers on Thursday joined picket lines, blocked bus garages
and rallied at the state Capitol. Seven teachers were charged with
blocking school buses in Kanawha County, and one picket suffered
torn ligaments when she was hit by a parent's car.
   Despite the attorney general's warning and the governor's
hard-line stance, the 16,000-member teachers' union has voted to
walk out in at least 40 counties and in six more by Monday if the
Legislature fails to vote them a pay raise.
   The union struck Wednesday in 10 of the state's 55 counties.
   Tompkins said that teachers have no right to strike and are
violating state laws by missing class and picketing schools, which
carry misdemeanor charges.
   He also said teachers who strike can be barred from teaching
anywhere in West Virginia for one year.
   Teachers who have been fired or allegedly resign will be
classified as new employees if they are rehired and will have to
pay health care premiums, said Sally Richardson, director of the
Public Employees Insurance Angency.
   A key teacher complaint is health care premiums that were
imposed in 1988 for newly hired teachers.
   The WVEA said West Virginia's average teacher pay of $21,904
ranks 49th in the nation, ahead of Mississippi. West Virginia's
22,000 teachers received a 5 percent raise last month.

   Fire officials searched the smoldering ruins to see if anyone
was inside when the blaze broke out, but neighbors said no one had

   Two vehicles were parked in the driveway.
   ``It's just leveled,'' said Patricia Slagle, who lives next
door. ``There's really nothing to find. If there had been anybody

   The 4,000 square-foot house on Lake Wylie had room-sized closets
and an air-conditioned dog house when Bakker and his wife, Tammy
Faye, lived there.
   Robert Rubino bought the home during the PTL bankruptcy
proceedings. Rubino was believed to be in New York on business,
Case said.

   Israeli warplanes attacked a Palestinian
guerrilla base near the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli today in
the first raid in the region in nearly five years, the Israeli
military command said.
   Targets were hit that had served as ``launching points'' for
attacks on Israel by the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command headed by Ahmed Jibril, a military
communique said.
   The communique gave no details of damage or injuries in the raid
on the Khan el-Khiyat area six miles north of Tripoli.
   It said all Israeli planes returned safely.
   The communique did not point to a specific attack blamed on
Jibril's militia. While Israel frequently attacks guerrilla bases
in south Lebanon in retaliation for attacks on or near the
Israeli-Lebanese border, the raid in northern Lebanon was unusual.
   The last in the area was on July 10, 1985, when Israeli jets
demolished a headquarters building of the Syrian-backed Palestinian
faction led by Saeed Mousa. At least five people were killed and 29
wounded in that air strike.
   It was the eighth air raid this year by Israeli jets against
targets in Lebanon.
   The last raid was Feb. 23 against a base near the south Lebanon
city of Sidon. Lebanese police said it belonged to the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a Damascus-based Palestinian
faction separate from Jibril's force.
   Last year, Israeli aircraft flew 17 raids on targets in Lebanon,
and Lebanese sources reported 28 people were killed in the attacks.
   Jibril is a former Syrian army captain who founded the radical
Popular Front in 1968. The group has hijacked several airliners. In
April 1974, three of its gunmen attacked the northern Israeli town
of Qiryat Shmona, killing 20 people before they were slain
themselves.

<TEXT>
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani said
today that the phone hoax in which President Bush thought he was
speaking to Rafsanjani but spoke instead to an impostor shows how
important Iran is in the world.
   ``Iran's stature in the world is so high that the biggest bully,
the most arrogant nation in the world is engaged in an effort to
contact Iran,'' Rafsanjani said in a sermon.
   The incident ``shows that the U.S. needs to talk to Iran, but
with God's grace, it is deprived (by Iran) of this blessing,'' said
Rafsanjani. His comments were broadcast on Tehran Radio and
monitored in Nicosia.
   Presidential Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in Washington on
Thursday that Bush returned a phone call last month to a man he
thought was the Iranian president, but it turned out to be a hoax.
   Bush spoke to the man about the release of U.S. hostages in
Lebanon, according to CBS News. Fitzwater would not give details
about the conversation.
   Asked if Bush immediately realized that the voice on the other
end of the line was not Rafsanjani, Fitzwater said: ``I can't tell
you how we determined it was a hoax.''
   The Bush administration has said it believes that Rafsanjani's
government has influence with the captors of the eight Americans
and 10 other Western captives held in Lebanon.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, 42, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Fitzwater and other White House officials said the bizarre chain
of events began when a man identifying himself as an Iranian
government official called the White House to say that Rafsanjani
wanted to talk to Bush about the hostages.
   ``The call came in, a number was given for us to call. We were
suspicious and began checking,'' Fitzwater said. ``But, ultimately,
the president needed to make the call as part of the check. He did
make the call.''
   Fitzwater said the fact that the call turned out to be a hoax is
unfortunate, but that Bush _ who frequently speaks to foreign
leaders by telephone _ remains determined to ``talk to anybody,
anytime, any place'' to try to gain the release of the hostages.

   Crowds angered by a new tax battled police, looted
stores, paraded effigies of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and
hurled bottles and eggs in protests across Britain. Dozens of
people were injured or arrested.
   Mrs. Thatcher today blamed a leftist group known as Militant
Tendency for the violence Thursday night that left the main street
in the London borough of Hackney strewn with glass.
   ``As you know, it is not the way to conduct affairs at all,''
she said during in appearance in Glasgow, Scotland. ``Any conduct
intimidating or violent is absolutely contradictory to democracy.''
   There have been four straight nights of violence against the new
``community charge,'' which replaces the system of taxing
homeowners to pay for government services. Instead, municipal
councils now divide the costs of services equally among all adults
in their district.
   Charges can vary widely, depending on the level of services
provided by a district. And since each adult is taxed, it means two
people living in a two-room apartment would pay twice as much as
one person living next door in an eight-room house.
   Anger over the system has sent the Conservatives' popularity
plunging to its lowest level in its decade of rule.
   Local legislators in the district of Haringey met today to
discuss their district's tax, which at $974 is one of the highest
in the country. During a meeting of the council Monday night,
demonstrations outside turned violent, and police had to clear
shouting protesters from the spectator section.
   Tony Benn, an opposition Labor Party member of Parliament, said,
``This is the first major civil disobedience campaign since the
suffragettes demanded the vote before the First World War.''
   The most serious unrest occurred Thursday night in Hackney, east
London, where 5,000 protesters gathered outside the city hall.
   About 300 police guarding the building charged the crowd when
members of it began hurling bottles and cans and attacked a police
car. Police said they made 57 arrests. They said about 30 officers
and an unspecified number of protesters were injured.
   Police Commander John Purnell said about 200 people broke away
from the main crowd and rampaged through a Hackney shopping mall,
hurling trash cans through windows and looting up to 50 stores.
   Protesters at Hackney carried placards reading ``Break the Tory
poll tax,'' ``Smash poll tax'' and ``Can't pay won't pay.'' The
Labor Party and other opponents have dubbed the community charge
the poll tax, after a similar per capita tax that caused a
rebellion in medieval times.
   At Camden in north London, protesters at City Hall screamed
insults at council members as 400 others blocked the road outside.
A crowd of about 400 jeered council members arriving for a meeting
at Ealing in west London.
   Police in Swindon, 70 miles west of London, linked arms to form
a human chain to stop 1,000 protesters from forcing their way into
the council chamber. People in the crowd there carried effigies of
Mrs. Thatcher with a noose around her neck and set one of them on
fire to loud cheers.
   At Hull in northeast England, security men ejected 50
demonstrators who screamed abuse at council members. Protesters at
Dudley in central England threw eggs at council members and
attacked a policeman.
   The new tax takes effect April 1 in England and Wales, when
local districts must submit to the federal government their annual
charges. The average household paying about $830 a year under the
former system will pay about $1,100, the Chartered Institute of
Public Finance Accountants says.
   Low-income and disabled people can receive rebates of up to 80
percent. But critics say that apart from this, the new tax is
unfair because it takes no account of an individual's ability to
pay.
   The community charge is already in force in Scotland amid
widespread protest there. Northern Ireland has its own separate
system for funding local authority spending.
   Mrs. Thatcher's intention in changing the tax system was to show
voters that local Labor-controlled districts were spending more
than Conservative-run districts.
   But critics say the government miscalculated the cost of local
services, and some Conservative-controlled authorities are among
those imposing the highest charges.
   In latest opinion polls, the Conservatives trail Labor by up to
19 points ahead of the next general election due by mid-1992.

<TEXT>
   The two Germanys today began preliminary
unification talks, preparing for next week's meeting with the four
World War II allies on German unity.
   Ernst Krabatsch, East Germany's deputy foreign minister, was
meeting with Dieter Kastrup, head of the political department at
West Germany's Foreign Ministry. They declined to comment to
reporters.
   The election commission, meanwhile, said 24 political parties
will contest East Germany's first free elections on March 18, the
ADN news agency said.
   Commission spokeswoman Petra Blaess said the final list includes
the Communists, now renamed the Party for Democratic Socialism; the
Social Democrats; the liberal Free Democrats; and the Alliance for
Germany, a conservative coalition backed by West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union.
   East Germany's 12.2 million eligible voters will seat a new
parliament with 400 members, 100 less than the current People's
Chamber.
   Today's discussions are part of the so-called ``two-plus-four''
formula of unification negotiations agreed to in Ottawa last month.
Under that formula the two German nations are to discuss the
domestic aspects of unification.
   On Wednesday in Bonn, the two Germanys are scheduled to meet
with low-level officials from the four World War II victors _ the
Soviet Union, the United States, Britain and France _ for initial
talks on how unification would affect European security and the
concerns of other nations.
   While the talks come barely a week before March 18 elections
that are expected to remove East Germany's Communist government
from power, the East Berlin government is carrying out the dialogue
with the approval of 15 other parties.
   The four World War II powers have given their blessing to the
idea of German unification, but enormous problems need to be
overcome.
   One of the thorniest stems from Moscow's insistence that a
united Germany not be a NATO member. Kohl on Thursday reassured
NATO members in Brussels of West Germany's wish for the new country
to remain in the Western alliance.
   ``We will continue talks on all levels. Nobody need fear Germany
will go its own way,'' he said.
   In addition, Poland on Thursday reiterated its demand for a role
in the talks, despite a vote by West Germany's Parliament that a
united Germany should honor Poland's western border. About a third
of Poland was German territory before World War II.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had come under fire abroad
and at home for his previous reluctance to unequivocally state that
a united Germany would never lay claim to land ceded to Poland
after the Third Reich's 1945 defeat.
   Kohl, apparently trying to avoid offending conservative voters
before federal elections in December, had insisted only the
government of a united Germany could address the matter.
   The two Germanys have formed the front between NATO and the
Warsaw Pact for over 40 years, and a united Germany would be a
colossal country of over 76 million inhabitants in strategically
important central Europe.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl favors allowing East
Germany's states simply to join up with their western neighbor,
which would be permitted under the West German constitution.
   That would be the quickest route to German unity.
   But opposition to this means of unification has been raised in
both German states, and Moscow has voiced its concern as well about
a hasty unification.

   The government said today it has begun
indirect talks with Moslem separatists in Kashmir, acknowledging
the independence movement has reached an ``unprecedented point.''
   ``We have a tough job here, but I would say I am meeting the
right people through intermediaries,'' said George Fernandes, the
Railways Minister who was selected by the government to lead
efforts to quell the secessionist movement.
   ``It is too early to say what shape the dialogue will take, but
at least the process has begun,'' he told reporters in a Srinagar
hotel.
   Asked what message he had sent the militants, Fernandes said:
``We have conveyed the government of India's stand on the issue.''
He did not elaborate.
   The independence campaign in India's Kashmir valley has left at
least 173 people dead since Jan. 20 in confrontations between
security forces and the militants. There were no immediate reports
of violence in Kashmir today.
   Across the border in Pakistan's Kashmir region, hundreds of
demonstrators marched near the frontier today and demanded that
residents of Indian Kashmir be allowed to decide their future.
   A protest leader, Sultan Mohamood, promised arms and training
for the Indians. Mohamood is leader of the Azad Muslim Conference,
a small opposition party in Pakistani Kashmir.
   The campaign for an independent Kashmir dates to the 1947
partition of the Indian subcontinent into Hindu-dominated India and
Islamic Pakistan, which each ended up with a portion of Kashmir.
India and Pakistan have fought two wars over the region.
   Fernandes arrived in Srinagar, the largest city in the valley
and the focal point of the agitation, on Thursday with a 14-member
delegation of political leaders who included former Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi and Deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal.
   The other members of the delegation returned to New Delhi today,
but Fernandes remained, apparently to begin talks with the
militants.
   It was not clear which of the militant organizations Fernandes
had contacted, and there were no signs from any of the groups that
they had been approached. Kashmiri Moslem groups have said they
will not settle for anything less than total independence.
   ``The mood of the people is very obvious,'' Fernandes said when
asked his perception of the situation. ``The campaign for secession
has reached an unprecedented point.''
   Earlier Thursday, authorities tightened the already strict
curfew. Unlike previous days, authorities in Srinagar did not relax
the curfew this morning to enable residents to shop for food and
other essentials.
   Jammu-Kashmir state Gov. Jagmohan, the top administrator for the
region, said there would be no easing of curfew restrictions ``in
view of the tension'' arising from the delegation's visit.
   On Thursday, about 40 residents invited to meet with Gandhi
became unruly and blamed his 1984-89 government for the troubles in
the mountainous northern state, where a lingering movement for
secession from Hindu-majority India has escalated in recent months.
   Also, thousands of Moslems inside mosques shouted Islamic
slogans and demanded independence as the convoy carrying the
delegation drove past Thursday.
   Moslems make up 64 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 6 million people.
Most of the Hindus live in the plains of Jammu, but a small
minority reside in the Kashmir valley. Gandhi's mother, former
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, was a Kashmiri Hindu.

   A fire broke out in the national
legislature today and damaged several reception rooms. Police
blamed activists who want Taiwan to drop its claim to be China's
legitimate government.
   Police said the early-morning blaze, which was put out in 15
minutes, started in one of the reception rooms and may have been
caused by firebombs.
   Nearby, police discovered a fence had been painted with the
slogan: ``Burn Chinese pirates to death. Strive for Taiwanese
Independence,'' and ``Bloodbath Taiwan.'' The references were
apparently to elderly members of the Yuan, Taiwan's highest
lawmaking body.
   The members were elected on the Chinese mainland shortly before
1949, when the Nationalist government fled to Taiwan after losing a
civil war to Communist forces. The aging legislators, who dominate
the body, have remained in office to support the ruling Nationalist
Party's claim to be the sole legitimate ruler of China. Last month,
the opposition called on them to retire.
   Many opposition members want the Nationalists to give up their
claim to be the legitimate government of China and recognize Taiwan
as a separate, independent country.
   Less than an hour after the legislature fire, a blaze occured at
the faculty dormitory at National Taiwan University. Police said
similar slogans were discovered painted on the building's door and
they suspected that the fire was set by the same arsonists.
   The blaze was quickly extinguished and no major damage reported.
   No one claimed responsibility for either fire.

   An heiress to the Mrs. Filbert's Margarine
fortune has been sentenced to 14 years in federal prison and fined
$20,000 for running a cocaine trafficking operation from her estate.
   Under federal guidelines, Sandra Filbert Amos could have been
sentenced to a maximum 17 years and fined $4 million at Thursday's
hearing. But U.S. District Judge Joseph C. Howard said Amos was
``already financially ruined.''
   She was also sentenced to three years' probation.
   ``I've really made a mess of my life,'' a tearful Amos, 35, told
Howard.
   ``I used drugs to live and I lived to use drugs. My life was
controlled by drugs. I was totally powerless,'' she said. ``I am
certainly sorry for being here today and I am certainly
remorseful.''
   Amos, who inherited $2 million, had spent $1,200 a week in
cocaine to support her 10-year cocaine addiction, the judge said,
referring to trial testimony.
   She was convicted Nov. 9 of one count of conspiring to
distribute 50 kilograms of cocaine and two counts of cocaine
distribution. Amos had helped her boyfriend, Jeremiah Dennis Case,
set up the drug operation from her $750,000 home near Easton,
according to testimony at her trial.
   Case, who pleaded guilty to drug charges in the case, was
earlier sentenced to 14 years in prison and was not fined. Amos'
co-defendant, Guillermo Moran of New York, was convicted of the
same charges and sentenced to 19 years and fined $100,000.
   The operation included a cocaine network and scheme to transport
440 pounds of cocaine from Florida to New Jersey for a Colombian
cocaine trafficking organization headed by Moran, according to
trial testimony.
   Amos completed 90 days at Excel Inc. Drug-Free Treatment Center
and has kept in touch with her counselor, court records show.
   Her attorneys, Donald Feige and Russell T. White, had already
filed an appeal and will request at a hearing Monday that Amos be
released on an appeal bond.
   Amos was returned to the Volunteers of America, where she is
participating in a federal work-release program.

Belfast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Irish Republican Army today
claimed responsibility for the slaying of a Protestant truck driver
who delivered construction materials to police stations and
military installations.
   Also today, police defused a two-pound bomb found in an empty
house in the Roman Catholic section of Belfast, authorities said.
   An IRA unit in East Tyrone said its members shot Thomas Jameson,
40, Thursday. They said his employers had repeatedly ignored
warnings to stop working for the security forces.
   The IRA is fighting to drive the British out of Northern Ireland
and to unite the area with the Irish Republic. It has targeted
construction firms to prevent repairs to the bomb damage it
inflicts on security installations. Two other employees of the
company where Jameson worked have been killed in IRA attacks.
   Jameson was identified as a part-time soldier in the Ulster
Defense Regiment, a locally recruited reserve force that supports
the police and army in Northern Ireland.
   But he was killed because of his work with the building firm,
said IRA supporters quoted by Press Association, Britain's domestic
news agency.
   Police said Jameson was driving a concrete mixer when men armed
with machine guns killed him outside Donaghmore village, 40 miles
west of Belfast. The gunmen fired at least 30 shots before driving
off in a car, police said.

   Two women face first-degree murder charges
in the execution-style slaying of a Marine Corps corporal who was
investigating an embezzlement scheme involving the squadron that
flies the president's helicopter, authorities say.
   Markeithia Reeves, 24, of Suitland, Md., and Tanya Morton, 23,
of Arlington, Va., were charged with killing Corporal Estella
Pearson, 26, of Detroit, according to Prince William County police.
The victim's body was found in her car Monday night at a shopping
center.
   None of the people involved in the case had ``access or
clearance'' for sensitive information or for the helicopters
serving President Bush, said presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater.
   Reeves, who worked with the victim at the Quantico Marine Base,
was charged with first-degree murder. Morton, a civilian employee
with the Navy Department, also was charged with first-degree murder.
   The Washington Post and The Washington Times reported today that
Pearson was investigating an embezzlement scheme, said to involve
payment of travel funds for trips that were not made.
   ``We can confirm that the possible motive the (Naval
Investigative Service) is investigating is embezzlement engaged in
by the two suspects and their attempt to silence Cpl. Pearson, who
may have been in the process of uncovering them,'' Sgt. Marv Price
told The Washington Times.
   Reeves has admitted being involved with the slaying of Pearson,
according to a criminal complaint filed with a magistrate by Prince
William County police.
   Reeves ``lured the victim...from the Marine Corps Base ... with
the intent to kill her,'' the complaint said. Reeves admitted
firing the gun while seated in the victim's car, the document said.
   Morton admitted taking part in the embezzlement scheme with
Reeves and ``was aware that Cpl. Pearson was investigating that
same embezzlement,'' according to a criminal complaint obtained by
the Post.
   Pearson lived in the barracks at the Marine base and worked in
the base's administrative offices for the helicopter squadron.
   Pearson was shot while sitting in her car, Prince William Police
Sgt. Barry Bernard said. Her body was discovered by passersby.
   Reeves was being held without bond and Morton was being held on
$25,000 bond in Prince William County.
   Preliminary hearings were scheduled for April 3 in Prince
William County General District Court.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Hundreds of people, some throwing
rocks, blocked streets in the capital today on the fourth day of
protests triggered by the army's killing of a schoolgirl.
   The normally bustling Port-au-Prince, a city of 1 million, was
virtually deserted this morning, with schools and stores closed.
Protesters blocked all main streets, and rocks were thrown at cars
on the seafront.
   On Thursday, thousands of people demonstrated in the capital and
several provincial towns, setting fires and calling for the
resignation of Haiti's military leader, Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.
   Three people were killed in the protests Thursday, including a
soldier beaten to death by a mob, independent radio reports said.
Fifteen people were injured in clashes with soldiers, according to
witnesses and a doctor at the state hospital in Port-au-Prince.
   The government has made no comment on the unrest, but a
high-ranking government official said today that Avril has no plans
to resign.
   ``Avril is ready to make concessions, but a hasty departure is
out of the question,'' said the official, speaking on condition he
not be further identified. He gave no indication what concessions
were contemplated.
   Avril indicated Wednesday he would resign if it was ``the will
of the people'' but said that would cause ``revolution and chaos.''
   The protests were triggered by the killing of 11-year-old
Rosaline Vaval Monday in the town of Petit Goave, where 10,000
mourners attended her burial Thursday.
   Radio Lumiere, a Protestant radio station, said today that a mob
went on a rampage in Petit Goave, a town of 15,000, on Tuesday
night, burning an army outpost, ransacking a government building
and the mayor's house.
   In Gonaives, a western port city of 40,000, mobs plundered the
house of Mayor Alexandre Louissaint, a Baptist pastor, and
ransacked his church and a government building, according to a
resident who spoke anomously.
   Earlier, about 3,000 people, shouting ``Liberty!'' and slogans
against Avril, marched on the Presidential Palace in
Port-au-Prince. Soldiers then fired in the air and beat
demonstrators with billy clubs.
   ``The will of the people is for Avril to step down,'' said a
communique released Thursday night by a coalition of 11 opposition
parties that earlier had called on Haitians to rise against the
military government.
   The marches in the capital and at least five provincial towns
are reminiscent of demonstrations in November 1985 to protest the
army's killing of three high school students in Gonaives. Those
protests led to the downfall of dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier, who
fled to exile in France in February 1986.
   Avril, a former Duvalier aide who came to power in September
1988 in a coup led by rank-and-file soldiers, has been under
increasing pressure from opposition groups to resign.
   President Bush mentioned Haiti on Thursday while attending a
ceremony in Fort Myer, Va., marking the U.S. invasion of Panama.
   ``The revolution continues,'' Bush said. ``The people have
spoken in Nicaragua. When they speak in Cuba and Haiti, our Western
Hemisphere will be entirely within the compass of freedom.''
   The opposition in Nicaragua, backed by the United States,
defeated President Daniel Ortega and his ruling Sandinistas in Feb.
25 elections.
   After taking power, Avril promised elections and reforms but
shipped seven pro-democracy leaders into exile during a crackdown
in January and arrested more than 50 opposition activists, some of
whom were beaten in custody.
   Although Avril has promised to hold elections this year, many
Haitians don't believe he can be trusted to hand over power to a
civilian government.
   In November 1987, the first free general elections since
independence from France in 1804 were canceled after attackers
protected by soldiers massacred at least 34 voters.
   Most Haitian parties have vowed to boycott the elections unless
Avril first steps down. They want a Supreme Court justice to
replace him until voters choose a new leader.
   Students and government critics had called for a national day of
mourning Thursday in sympathy for the 11-year-old girl, shot by a
soldier breaking up an anti-government demonstration.
   Maj. Gen. Serge Saint-Eloi, the inspector general of the army,
said Thursday night the girl was shot by a soldier from a passing
vehicle but said an investigation would not be conducted because
her parents buried her before an autopsy could be done.

   Fourteen inmates, including three
facing murder charges, escaped from jail by cutting steel window
bars with smuggled hacksaws and sliding down knotted bedsheets,
sheriff's officials said today.
   ``We don't know how it was masterminded but our investigation
shows there was outside help,'' Assistant San Diego County Sheriff
Ken Wiggington said at a news conference today.
   Two of the inmates involved in Wednesday night's breakout were
recaptured.
   ``Two hacksaws were used to break out the bars over the window,
then inmates used bedsheets knotted together to lower themselves to
the ground,'' Wiggington said.
   The inmates evaded perimeter guards and security cameras, and
Sheriff's Capt. Charles Wood said today that the jail's alarm
system is defective and wasn't working at the time of the escape.
   Wood, commander of the South Bay Detention facility, said the
hacksaws were smuggled in through an unprotected window in a day
area used by inmates during recreational periods.
   The inmates had been housed in a section of the jail reserved
for serious felony offenders.
   In December, seven inmates escaped through a tiny window after
lubricating their bodies with lotion and lowered themselves 80 feet
to the ground with a bedsheet rope. Three remain at large from that
escape, sheriff's officials said.
   That breakout was from a section which housed 123 inmates in
space designed for 24.

   A moderate earthquake measuring 5.5 on the
Richter scale shook wide sections of south-central Alaska early
today, but there were no immediate reports of any damage or
injuries, officials said.
   The quake was centered about 60 miles northwest of Homer, said
Alec Medbery of the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center.
   ``It was felt all the way from Kodiak Island to Anchorage,
Palmer and Seward,'' Medbery said. ``But it was too small for a
tsunami,'' a sea wave generated by a quake.
   The 1964 ``Good Friday'' Alaska earthquake that measured 8.5 on
the Richter scale generated large waves that devastated several
coastal communities, including Valdez, and killed 131 people as far
south as Oregon and Hawaii.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus, a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10
times strong than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage, 4
moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, and 6 severe damage.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After more than a month of savage
fighting, Gen. Michel Aoun called today for peace talks with a
rival Christian warlord and with Moslem leaders to settle Lebanon's
civil war.
   In an unusually conciliatory statement, Aoun said there will be
no more clashes among Christians or between Christians and Moslems.
He also dropped his rejection of an Arab League plan intended to
end 15 years of civil war.
   In another development, police said rival Shiite Moslem militias
loyal to Syria and Iran clashed in south Beirut and south Lebanon.
No casualties were reported.
   A police spokesman said Syrian troops moved in and disengaged
Shiite zealots of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, and
fighters of the mainstream Shiite Amal, or Hope, militia in south
Beirut's seaside district of Ouzai.
   The firefight blocked traffic for 30 minutes along the coastal
highway which links west Beirut with south Lebanon, the spokesman
said.
   In south Lebanon's Iqlim el-Tuffah province, the two factions
dueled intermittently with howitzers and mortars, the spokesman
said.
   Also, Israeli warplanes attacked a Palestinian guerrilla base
near the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli in the first raid in the
region in nearly five years, the Israeli military said. It made no
mention of any casualties.
   Aoun described as ``self-destructive'' the clashes between his
troops and Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia, which have
killed more than 750 people since they broke out Jan. 31. Aoun
called on Geagea to declare his ``readiness for dialogue so we can
meet.
   ``Once two people manage to meet, they can invite others,'' Aoun
said in an invitation to non-Christian leaders to join in
discussions for a settlement to the civil war. His statement
appeared in the daily An-Nahar.
   The Arab League plan, which shifts some political power to
Lebanon's Moslem majority, was worked out by Lebanese legislators
in the Saudi Arabian town of Taif in October.
   ``Abrogating the Taif accord is not necessary to launch
dialogue,'' Aoun told the independent daily, though he added that
he would like some amendments. He did not elaborate.
   He originally rejected the accord because it did not include a
fixed timetable for the withdrawal of Syria's 40,000 troops, in
Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   Aoun had rejected the parliamentary election of President Elias
Hrawi, who pledged to implement the peace plan. Aoun had refused
Hrawi's order to step down as army commander and leave the
Presidential Palace.
   Aoun's 19,000 army troops and Samir Geagea's 6,000-member
Lebanese Forces militia fought each other to a standstill in a
power struggle for the 310-square mile Christian enclave before
accepting a cease-fire on Saturday.
   Police said the cease-fire was generally holding despite minor
exchanges of sniper fire in some districts of east Beirut.
   A mediation committee of three independent Christian figures was
holding a series of meetings separately with Aoun and Geagea in an
effort to stabilize the truce, reopen all roads blocked by mines
and barricades and disengage the combatants before starting a
discussion on a political settlement.
   Aoun and Geagea are Maronites, the Catholic community which has
dominated political life in Lebanon since 1943. The Taif accord
called for distributing government posts and parliamentary seats
equally among Moslems and Christians.

   A tugboat and a freighter collided today on
the Mississippi, sinking at least three grain barges and setting
loose up to 14 others, the Coast Guard said.
   A 20-mile stretch of the river was closed as tugs worked to
round up the stray barges, said Petty Officer Bob Morehead.
   ``I'm told it looks like a river rodeo with tugs chasing barges
all over the place,'' he said.
   No injuries were reported. ``Right now we're just trying to get
the barges under control and then we'll investigate what
happened,'' Morehead said.
   The freighter Nancy Lykes was headed upriver at 6:30 a.m. when
it and the tug Coral Dawn, headed downriver with up to 30 barges of
grain, collided near White Castle, 20 miles south of Baton Rouge,
the Coast Guard said.
   Coast Guard Capt. William Loesfstedt ordered the river closed in
both directions while the barges were rounded up and investigators
assessed the hazard posed by the sunken barges.
   Morehead said he didn't know what the freighter was carrying and
that it did not appear to be leaking.
   The Nancy Lykes is owned by Lykes Brothers and the Coral Dawn is
owned by the Archer Daniels Midland Co. of Illinois.

warnings to stop working for the security forces.
   The IRA is fighting to drive the British out of Northern Ireland
and to unite the area with the Irish Republic. It has targeted
construction firms to prevent repairs to the bomb damage it
inflicts on security installations. Two other employees of the
company where Jameson worked have been killed in IRA attacks.
   Jameson was identified as a part-time soldier in the Ulster
Defense Regiment, a locally recruited reserve force that supports
the police and army in Northern Ireland.
   But he was killed because of his work with the building firm,
said IRA supporters quoted by Press Association, Britain's domestic
news agency.
   Police said Jameson was driving a concrete mixer when men armed
with machine guns killed him outside Donaghmore village, 40 miles
west of Belfast. The gunmen fired at least 30 shots before driving
off in a car, police said.

   Former President Reagan was one of more than 100
callers offering birthday wishes to a critically injured boy who
was beaten, bound and set aflame after refusing a neighborhood
bully's order to take drugs.
   David Aupont spent his 12th birthday Thursday fighting for his
life, with doctors giving him a 50-50 chance of survival following
the vicious attack in an abandoned building.
   The 13-year-old charged with Wednesday's attack was described as
a foster child with learning disabilities who dropped out of the
sixth grade, and whose vicious behavior grew out of his own torment
at the hands of older children.
   The White House and Mayor David Dinkins were among those who
showered the badly burned David with cards, gifts, balloons,
flowers and messages, said New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center
spokeswoman Diana Goldin. Three people sent teddy bears, and
Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden sent a radio.
   None of the callers could speak with the boy. Reagan said he
would call back when David recovers, said Goldin.
   The youth, who suffered burns over 55 percent of his body, was
under heavy sedation in critical but stable condition, said Dr.
Cleon Goodwin, head of the hospital burn unit. He should be
hospitalized for up to four months and undergo skin grafts to
repair the second-degree burns over much of his body.
   ``He's a fighter,'' Goodwin said. ``If you ask him if it hurts,
he says, `No,' even when we know it does. He's tough.''
   David was walking to school with five friends Wednesday when the
assailant approached, said Detective Joseph McConville. Two of the
boys fled but the 13-year-old robbed the remaining three.
   He then took David to a basement in an abandoned apartment
building, doused him with gasoline and told David he would set him
aflame if he did not take drugs, McConville said.
   David, his hands tied behind his back, was beaten with a
baseball bat and set aflame while tied to a sewer pipe. He managed
to escape and ran to an auto repair shop for help. Originally,
police thought the attack occurred in a garage, but later
attributed that report to a bloodhound's false tracking.
   Luther Aupont, David's father, told reporters he had spoken with
his son but started crying and could not continue.
   David, a clean-cut boy who attended the sixth grade, is ``a
normal kid. He got along with kids,'' said his stepbrother,
22-year-old Rudy LeBrun.
   The Auponts moved to New York from Port-au-Prince, Haiti, about
18 months ago.
   The suspect was charged with attempted murder second degree,
assault first degree, kidnapping second degree, robbery and
attempted robbery, said police spokesman Hugh Barry.

<HEAD>Polish Leaders Come To France To Talk About Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski and Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki of Poland arrived in Paris today to seek French
backing for stronger border guarantees from a united Germany.
   In talks with President Francois Mitterrand, the Polish leaders
are expected to stress their country's desire to play a prominent
role in discussions later this year between the two Germanys and
the four allied powers _ the United States, France, Britain and the
Soviet Union.
   The Poles have been particularly concerned about West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's vague statements on the permanence of the
border with Poland, a stance Kohl changed only this week.
   On Thursday, the West German Parliament passed a resolution
proposed by Kohl stating that the two German nations should adopt
declarations saying ``the Polish people are assured (that) their
right to live in secure borders will not be questioned by us
Germans through territorial claims either now or in the future.''
Those declarations, Parliament said, should be the basis for a
future treaty signed by a newly united Germany.
   ``This change is a tiny step in the right direction,''
Jaruzelski was quoted as saying in an interview published today by
the Paris daily Liberation.
   ``There is a Polish proverb that says that one spoonful of tar
is enough to ruin a barrel of honey,'' he said.
   ``Everybody knows that tactics must serve strategy and not the
other way around. It seems that the (West German) electoral tactic
dominated the strategy of historic reconciliation between our
peoples.''
   Officials from the four allied powers are to meet for
preliminary unification talks with the two Germanys on Wednesday.
Poland has been pressing to participate in the talks.
   The Polish president noted in the newspaper interview that
Poland had participated in the Potsdam conference in 1945 and was
present during the talks that set the present Oder-Neisse border
between Poland and East Germany.
   ``Today, the Soviet Union supports the Polish demand to
participate in the conference on German unity and I must say that
it would be incomprehensible for us if France, a traditional friend
of Poland, did not share this position,'' Jaruzelski said.
   Today's trip marked the first joint foreign visit by Jaruzelski,
a Communist, and Mazowiecki, a Solidarity activist who became prime
minister after the 1989 elections that catapulted a coaltion led by
the trade union into power.
   Asked if the double visit had a special significance, Jaruzelski
said it did. ``We wanted, in fact, to make two points in this
visit,'' Liberation quoted Jaruzelski as saying.
   ``On the international level, to stress the importance Poland
attaches to the German question (and) on an internal level, to show
the very constructive character of political cohabitation in Poland
on all the essential questions.''

<TEXT>
   Takako Doi was re-elected today to head the Japan
Socialist Party, the country's largest opposition group, and
expressed hope the party will be able to end the Liberal Democrats'
35-year rule.
   Ms. Doi, 61, was the only candidate for the post. She will begin
her third two-year term when her election is endorsed at the
party's congress April 3-5.
   Ms. Doi told a news conference she will focus her efforts on
developing the Socialist Party into a force capable of taking over
the leadership of the country from the conservative Liberal
Democratic Party.
   Ms. Doi, a veteran lawmaker, became the first woman ever to head
a major political party in Japan 3{ years ago when the Socialists
were crushed in a lower house election and her predecessor resigned.
   ``I first hesitated to run for the chairmanship because I
thought it's an appropriate time to step down,'' she said after her
election. But Ms. Doi changed her mind after finding that no one
else would run for the top job.
   Ms. Doi's popularity helped lead her party to an unprecedented
victory in July in the upper house of Parliament. That forced the
Liberal Democrats into a minority in the chamber for the first time.
   In the election last month for the powerful lower house, the
Socialists made substantial gains, winning 136 seats in the
512-seat chamber. They previously held 83 seats.

   The Venetian canals, lifelines of this
lagoon city, are dangerously low largely due to accumulated mud,
officials said today.
   While the Grand Canal and several other major waterways are open
to navigation, traffic on scores of smaller canals has come to a
halt this week.
   A city fireboat burned out its motor after getting stuck in the
mud in one canal, the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera reported.
   ``The canals have not been dug up in 40 years, and that is the
main problem,'' said an official from the city's waterworks.
   Last month, a man who suffered a heart attack was taken through
the streets in a baggage cart to the hospital because the ambulance
corps feared their boat would get stuck in the mud, Corriere
reported.

<HEAD>Mandela Seeks International Funding to Resettle South African
Exiles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nationalist leader Nelson Mandela
called on the international community today to provide funds to
resettle thousands of exiles who plan to return to South Africa.
   ``We will need tremendous resources to find jobs and
accomodations for thousands of exiles and political detainees''
still held in South African jails, the African National Congress
leader said.
   ``We rely on the international community, particularly the
African states, to provide the required resources,'' Mandela added.
   Mandela, 71, was the world's best-known political prisoner until
South Africa freed him last month and legalized the ANC guerrilla
group as a step toward possible white-black negotiations.
   The ANC estimates there are 15,000 political exiles living
throughout Africa who may return to South Africa now that the ANC
and several other anti-government groups are legal.
   Mandela interrupted a visit to Tanzania to fly to Addis Ababa
for the speech in the ornate Africa Hall of the Organization of
African Unity.
   Afterward, he returned to Tanzania to complete his scheduled
six-day visit with a tour of ANC guerrilla training camps in the
East Africa nation. He will leave for Sweden on Sunday.
   Mandela said he had received military training in Ethiopia
before he was arrested in 1962 for illegally leaving South Africa.
He was subsequently sentenced to life in prison for sabotage and
treason. The government commuted that sentence last month.
   Mandela plans to travel to Sweden next week.
   A spokesman for Sweden's Foreign Ministry, Lars-Olof Lundberg,
said today that Mandela has asked to cut two days off his planned
weeklong visit.
   He gave no reason for Mandela's request, but the Swedish news
agency TT said Mandela was concerned with unrest in South Africa's
black homelands and a warning from the white-led South African
government that it might intervene with emergency powers to end the
violence.
   More than 20 people were killed this week in clashes between
homeland authorities and groups demanding reincorporation into
South Africa, and in factional fights over local issues in black
townships in South Africa.
   The ANC named Mandela deputy president last week, making him the
effective leader of the organization. ANC President Oliver Tambo,
once Mandela's law partner in South Africa, entered a Stockholm
clinic in January after suffering a stroke. Mandela was expected to
spend considerable time visiting Tambo.

   A woman who claimed she was blinded and
lost her senses of taste and smell because of injuries suffered
when a truck ran her off a freeway has been awarded $3.7 million.
   ``Under the circumstances, we thought the award appropriate,''
said Arthur Tiddle, foreman of the Pomona Superior Court jury that

   Elaine Fleishman, a 61-year-old mother of five who used to be a

   The jurors found negligence on the part of the truck driver,
Robert G. Meyer, 66, his employer, Road West Express, and the
company that held the trucking permits, Roadex Inc.
   An off-duty police officer testified he saw the truck move right
and strike a pickup, then swerve to the left and strike Ms.
Fleishman's car.

<TEXT>
   Two horses loose on a street were killed by a
truck and a city crew was sent to remove the carcasses. But the
workers found that one horse had already been buried _ on the spot
in a median strip.
   ``Believe me, after 18 years in this business, this is one of
the most bizarre things I've ever seen,'' Ulysses Ford, head of the
city's Solid Waste Management Department, said Friday.
   ``To be honest with you, it would be unlikely for anybody to do
this. I don't know why someone would do this,'' he said. ``I just
can't imagine their purpose.''
   Ron Blackwell said that when he arrived at work Thursday at an
auto parts store he noticed a dead horse lying in the middle of the
median on the street and a second dead horse across the street.
   Blackwell said he called the city health department and then the
solid waste department.
   He said he and co-workers next saw a crew show up with digging
equipment in yellow trucks bearing round emblems.
   ``They dug a hole and buried him and left,'' Blackwell said. ``I
mean this is a full-grown horse. It'd stand 16 hands high at the
shoulder. I'll tell you, I ain't never seen nothing like that
before in my life.
   ``They come out with equipment and dig a hole in the middle of
this esplanade out here and bury that horse. Right in the middle of
the street out here. I've been in 48 states and three countries,
and I ain't never seen _ not even in the uncivilized countries do
they bury a horse in the middle of the road.''
   Ford said some city departments, not including his, have yellow
trucks with round emblems. But, he said, no one has been able to
determine who buried the horse.
   ``There are several different public agencies that could have
been involved _ state, county or city,'' he said. A private
contractor or utility company could also have performed the deed,
he said.
   Ford said his workers later removed the second horse to a
landfill and his department is coordinating with the city's parks
department to remove the buried horse.
   Dewey Senegal said the horses were kept on his land in far
southern Houston and wandered into the road after someone
apparently left a gate open.

   Telephone service from Japan to Cambodia resumed
Friday after a 15-year cutoff, according to KDD, Japan's largest
international telecommunications company.
   Service, which is routed through Moscow, will be available 24
hours a day, but customers will have to wait an average of one to
two hours after placing their calls through an operator, a KDD
official said.
   KDD was able to restore telephone service between the two
countries after a new shortwave telephone link went into service
late last year between Moscow and Cambodia, said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Calls will cost $19 for the first three minutes and $3.20 for
each extra minute, he said.
   Telecommunication service between Japan and Cambodia was cut
near the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, the official said.

   A 6-year-old Shanghai boy has won praise for
informing police that his father was gambling, according to a local
daily.
   Shanghai's Liberation Daily, in a Thursday report seen in
Beijing on Friday, said Wang Leyi appeared at a police station last
week to report that his father was playing mahjongg and ask police
to ``go and take care of the situation.''
   When asked by police who had sent him, the kindergarten pupil
said, ``gambling is bad and I came on my own to report him.''
   The report said police went to the boy's home, found the adults
of the family gambling while playing mahjongg, and ``educated'' the
father.
   The boy, on returning home, said, ``I was the one who asked the
`uncle policeman' to come.''
   Police and neighbors gathered to watch the scene smiled when he
said this, and Wang's father and the other adults were moved by his
actions, the newspaper said. They said he had done the right thing
and promised to stop.
   Children in China are commonly told to report wrongdoings, and
it is not uncommon for children to win praise for turning in
relatives.
   There were a few reported cases of relatives turning in student
activists in hiding after the military crackdown of the
pro-democracy movement last spring, although in general the public
was unresponsive to government demands they help track down
dissidents.

<TEXT>
   President Bush knew a caller claiming to be
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani might be an impostor but spoke
with him ``on the off chance'' it might signal a breakthrough for
U.S. hostages, the White House said today.
   ``The president's feeling was: what if it's real? I want the
American people to know, and the families of the hostages to know
that I am willing to check out every possibility,'' said
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater conceded that the phone conversation that occurred
last month was an embarrassment since it turned to be a hoax. But,
he added, ``This phone call is just another reminder of the fact
that we will pursue every lead we can get.''
   He also said the episode reflects the frustration the
administration faces in its efforts to find ways to press for the
release of the eight U.S. and 10 other Western hostages being held
in Lebanon.
   Fitzwater said the administration still does not know who
initiated the hoax and could not rule out the possibility that it
originated within a faction of the Iranian government.
   Bush brushed off reporters' questions about the phone call
during an event in the Rose Garden, declaring: ``Said it all.'' It
apparently was a reference to statements by Fitzwater and other
administration officials.
   Meanwhile, Rafsanjani said in a sermon broadcast on Tehran radio
that ``Iran's stature in the world is so high that the strongest
power in the world, and the greatest power on Earth, is striving to
find an opening with your executive leader even through telephone
wires.''
   ``Can it be that such a global power, with all its intelligence
capabilities, talks to a person it cannot identify?'' he asked.
``This is a strange occurrence.''
   ``This shows the United States very much needs to talk to Iran,
but, with God's grace, it is deprived of this blessing,'' he said.
   ``Now we must wait for explanations and witness another Irangate
in the making, God willing,'' Rafsanjani said, referring to the
ill-fated effort by the Reagan administration to trade arms for the
release of hostages.
   Fitzwater, asked about Rafsanjani's statement, said it
``reflects the difficulty of the situation: One day we hear
moderate points of view, the next day we hear antagonistic ones.''
   ``So our position remains steadfast: we want to do everything we
can to get the hostages out. The president will talk to anyone, any
time,'' Fitzwater said.
   He and other White House officials said the bizarre chain of
events began when a man identifying himself as an Iranian
government official called the White House to say Rafsanjani wanted
to talk to Bush about U.S. hostages held in Lebanon.
   Fitzwater said today that, in view of the ``unorthodox manner''
Iran has used for communicating with the West in the past, ``any
communication from the leadership of Iran has to be treated
differently.''
   ``This call came in. It was suspicious in origin,'' Fitzwater
said.
   Officials said there were two calls _ the initial one and a
second one during which Bush talked with the impostor.
   Fitzwater said Bush was ``willing to make this call on the
off-chance that it might be real.'' Fitzwater later was vague on
whether the second call was placed or received by the White House,
saying he didn't want to get into such details.
   The initial call came to national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft, White House aides said.
   The episode was first reported Thursday by CBS News.
   Eight Americans, including Terry Anderson, the chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, and 10 other Westerners are
being held hostage in Lebanon.
   The Bush administration contends Rafsanjani's government has
influence with those holding the hostages.
   The disclosure of the hoax came amid a flurry of recent reports
on hostage-related developments. However, U.S. officials have said
they are unable to cite any actual movement toward freeing the
hostages.
   Although he was tricked once, Bush would do the same thing again
if he thought it would help win the release of the hostages, his
spokesman said.
   ``If a call came through at some future point that we believed
was real, he would take it,'' Fitzwater said. ``The president has
made it known he's willing to talk to Iran at any time. And the
ball is in their court. So it's up to them to signal a willingness
to talk.''
   Fitzwater said the administration has let Rafsanjani know
``through diplomatic channels as well as publicly, that we're
willing to talk whenever they're ready. And they have come back and
said, `we're not ready'.''
   Fitzwater declined to go into details of Bush's conversation
with the unknown caller.
   CBS said the president ``repeated U.S. policy that goodwill will
beget goodwill but there could be no quid pro quo for U.S.
hostages,'' CBS said.

<HEAD>Railways Vice Minister Ousted For Taking Bribes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A vice minister of railways has been ousted for
allegedly taking bribes, becoming one of the highest-ranking
officials toppled in a nationwide campaign against corruption, the
government said Friday.
   Luo Yunguang, who had been vice minister since 1986, was the
fifth Railways Ministry official accused of corruption in the past
six months.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Luo ignored corruption by
his aides, and personally accepted a gold ring, a refrigerator and
the equivalent of $465 in bribes. It did not say what he did in
return for the bribes.
   He has returned the money and the ring, it said, and prosecutors
are looking into the case. He has not yet been legally charged.
   Luo ``seriously discredited the reputation of the Railways
Ministry and had a vile political influence,'' state TV said.
   Top leaders ordered a nationwide offensive against official
corruption last summer, after watching student pro-democracy
protesters win massive public support in large part because of
their demands for clean government.
   In recent years, gift-giving has become an essential part of
most official applications, with bribes ranging from a bottle of
liquor for a scarce ticket to cash for a passport or an apartment.
   The government set up special hotlines for reporting corruption,
and offered leniency to people who confessed. By year's end it said
it had received reports of more than 216,000 cases and had dealt
with more than a quarter of them.
   However, many Chinese remain cynical about the government
clean-up efforts, noting that most of those charged are lower level
officials and that no children of high officials have been charged
even though several are engaged in questionable trade activities.
   Other high officials charged include Hainan Gov. Liang Xiang,
accused of helping family members in illegal profiteering schemes,
and the vice chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
Tohti Sabir, accused of taking bribes. Liang is widely believed to
have been targeted because he was an ally of ousted Communist Party
chief Zhao Ziyang.
   Xinhua said the State Council, China's Cabinet, ordered Luo to
hand over all his illegal income, and will continue to investigate
his activities. The party is conducting its own investigation, it
said.
   Four Railways Ministry officials, including the director of the
ministry's Transportation Department and his three aides, were
accused in October of taking bribes to allocate rail cars for
transporting goods. The demand for cars far exceeds supply.

   Leftist rebels attacked army
positions in the eastern and northern parts of the country today,
and the military said at least five people were killed and five
injured in fighting.
   An army news release said guerrillas mounted a pre-dawn attack
on an army post guarding the Oromontique coffee processing plant at
Santiago de Maria, a town 75 miles east of San Salvador in Usulutan
province.
   The rebels withdrew after a six-hour gun battle, during which
one rebel and three government soldiers were killed and three
soldiers were wounded, the news release said.
   A Red Cross spokesman said an unspecified number of civilians
were also wounded during the gun battles but could not give
immediate details. Police in the town said the coffee plant was
damaged.
   Coffee and cotton are El Salvador's main export crops.
   Another soldier was killed and two were wounded in scattered
attacks early today in three towns in the northern and eastern
parts of the country, a second news release said. It provided no
details.
   On Thursday night, guerrillas attacked a power station and at
least four army posts in the northern part of San Salvador, causing
brief electrical outages, military sources said.
   The intense fire and occasional explosions during the night
startled residents, but the armed forces press committee said no
deaths or injuries were reported in the attacks in four densely
populated northern sectors of the city.
   The areas also were the scene of heavy combat during a major
offensive in November by the leftist Farabundo National Liberation
Front.
   ``We do not have much information. We know they attacked guards
at the Miralvalle electrical substation and army positions in
Ayutuxtepeque, San Ramon, Escandia and Plan de Pito,'' an army
spokesman said by telephone.
   Army troops moved through the area and military helicopters and
planes dropped flares onto suspected rebel positions.
   The army spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
troops were patrolling the northern neighborhoods and other parts
of the city ``to avoid more terrorist harassment.''
   In a statement, the guerrillas said the attacks were part of a
concerted campaign to show President President Alfredo Cristiani's
rightist government they still have enough military power to
inflict damage.
   The FMLN guerrillas are thought to face potential supply and
command problems following the defeat of the lefits Sandinista
party in Nicaragua's elections. The Sandinistas have said they will
give way to the United National Opposition on April 25, when
President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro takes office.
   The statement broadcast by the rebels' clandestinate Radio
Venceremos indicated the campaign was aimed at forcing Cristiani's
government into negotiations to end to decade-old civil war that
has claimed more than 71,000 lives, most of them civilian.
   ``The FMLN is once again on a military campaign to show the
armed forces, the Cristiani government and all other interested
parties that it is willing to seek a negotiated solution to the
conflict, but it is the fascists who continue to cling to the idea
the FMLN is weak because of what is happening in other countries,''
the statement said.

   Lavon Barve won $3,000 in silver ingots
and the halfway trophy at this wilderness checkpoint, more than a
half-hour ahead of defending champion Joe Runyan in the 18th annual
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.
   Barve arrived at the official halfway checkpoint at 10:57 p.m.
   Runyan was followed by three-time winner Susan Butcher, Dee Dee
Jonrowe, Robin Jacobson, Martin Buser, Rick Swenson, the Iditarod's
only four-time champion, and Tim Osmar.
   Seventy teams left Anchorage last Saturday to compete in the
1,160-mile endurance run across mountains, wind-swept rivers,
Arctic Ocean ice and treeless tundra.
   The silver ingots awarded the first musher to reach the official
halfway point have become something of a jinx. Only once since the
race was organized in 1973 has the winner of the halfway money held
on to win the race.
   The Iditarod, named for a tiny ghost town along the route,
commemorates the 1925 emergency delivery by dog teams of
life-saving diphtheria serum to Nome.
   The race in past years has taken from 11 to 18 days to complete.

   Police used tear gas and steel-tipped

were injured, news reports said.
   The protesters were demonstrating against controversial Moslem

   The protesters complain that Saidi opposed the 1971 war in which
Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan. Saidi, a central
leader of Moslem fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami, denied the charge.
   After the clash, the authorities banned the gathering of more

   That fellow who pretended to be Ali Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani on the other end of the telephone has done a lot
of damage to the American republic. He's going to make it hard for
George Bush to conduct his presidency.
   Everybody knows of Bush's penchant for working the telephones,
calling up and taking calls from other world leaders.
   Now that he's been stung, how will Bush know when a caller is
real or an impostor?
   This is the way things might go in the Oval Office ...

And, George, we're not raising any objections if the Germans
unite.''
   ``Hey, listen, buddy. Are you one of those impostors? I don't

<TEXT>
   The city has declared a 17-block chunk of the
Upper West Side a historic district, a move that would preserve
hundreds of distinctive row houses and apartment buildings.
   ``In this constantly and rapidly changing city, it is crucial to
protect the best of our architectural heritage or else it will
disappear,'' Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger said before
Thursday's vote by the Board of Estimate.
   The new Riverside-West End Historic District includes 265 row
houses and apartment buildings reflecting the Beaux-Arts,
Renaissance, Gothic and Romanesque styles. The buildings were
constructed between 1884 and 1939.
   The designation means the facades of buildings cannot be altered
without permission from the city's Landmarks Preservation
Commission.
   At a hearing held in 1987, 62 of 71 speakers favored the
designation. Those who disagreed, for the most part, were property
owners who said the designation might hurt them by forcing them to
pay for expensive restorations instead of less expensive repairs.
   In addition, they said the designation might prevent them from
developing or selling their properties.
   The area runs from Riverside Drive between West 85th Street and
West 95th Street, over one block east to West End Avenue between
West 87th Street and West 94th Street. It also includes some parts
of blocks between West End and Broadway.

<TEXT>
   A Greyhound bus carrying 29 passengers
was struck by at least three bullets fired from a passing vehicle
early today in central Ohio, police said.
   No injuries were reported, and there were no arrests.
   The driver was from another bus company who is driving for
Greyhound during a nationwide bus drivers strike against the
Greyhound Lines Inc., said company spokeswoman Elizabeth Hale.
   The State Highway Patrol said the shooting on Interstate 71 in
Madison County, about 25 miles southwest of Columbus, at 12:40 a.m.
   A vehicle passed the bus, allowed the bus to pass and then
pulled alongside the bus. The vehicle's driver turned off the
headlights and shots were fired from the vehicle, the highway
patrol said.
   ``One shot glanced off the left side driver's window, one shot
glanced off the left passenger's window, and one shot struck and
lodged in the lower middle body of the bus,'' said Kathy Kral, a
spokeswoman at the patrol's Wilmington post. ``The vehicle then
sped away.''
   The bus driver went to a truck weighing station and stopped to
report the shooting. The bus continued another 40 miles to
Cincinnati, where police and company officials examined the vehicle.
   The passengers were transferred to another bus to complete the
trip from Cleveland to Louisville, Ky., Ms. Hale said from
Greyhound's Dallas headquarters. She declined to identify the
driver.
   The strike began early March 2 when the Amalgamated Council of
Greyhound Local Unions and the company failed to reach agreement on
a new three-year contract. Greyhound has been operating at reduced
levels since the strike, using replacements hired and trained in
the last two weeks plus any union members who cross picket lines.

   A judge has ruled that a Colombian believed
to be a high-ranking member of the Medellin drug cartel was legally
extradited to the United States to face drug conspiracy charges.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas R. Brett also ruled that prosecutors
would not be required to reveal the names of their witnesses or
details of expected testimony until 48 hours before the trial.
Brett cited security reasons.
   Jose Rafael Abello-Silva of Santa Marta, Colombia, is charged
with two counts of conspiring to import drugs. He was extradited
Oct. 29 from Bogota to Tulsa, where he was indicted in 1987 on drug
charges.
   Prosecutors say Abello is the fourth-highest member of the
Medellin drug cartel.
   Defense attorneys Patrick Williams and Richard Haynes had
claimed Abello's extradition violated a 1979 treaty between
Colombia and the United States.
   Brett's order, made Wednesday and released Thursday, maintained
Abello was extradited under guidelines of a decree signed in 1989
by Colombian President Virgilio Barco Vargas that provides for
extradition of suspected narcotics traffickers.
   Abello's trial has been scheduled to begin next week, but was
postponed Thursday until March 21 because Haynes was tied up with a
trial in California.

<HEAD>Countries Pledge Cooperation, Consider Good Neighborliness</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of the six Balkan countries
pledged Friday to promote cooperation in the region in their first
meeting since radical change swept Eastern Europe.
   Senior diplomats from Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey,
Yugoslavia and Greece spent three days assessing their efforts ``to
consistently promote the process of multilateral and bilateral
cooperation,'' they said in a statement.
   ``They stressed that the work already done should be continued
and the momentum of multilateral Balkan cooperation should be
maintained,'' the statement said.
   Delegates reviewed progress since their foreign ministers first
met in Belgrade in February 1988. Balkan foreign ministers are due
to meet again in Tirana, Albania, in October, the statement said.
   In 18 lower-level meetings in the last two years, the countries
have decided to cooperate in the fields of economy, trade,
industry, technology, tourism, railways, health and environment.
   They have also discussed forming a joint front against terrorism
and arms and drug trafficking in the Balkans, which form a bridge
between the Middle East and Europe.
   During this week's meeting, Albanian Deputy Foreign Minister
Mohamet Kaplani proposed a charter on principles of good
neighborliness, the statement said.
   The proposal was one more step in isolationist Albania's opening
toward its neighbors. Its ruling Communist Party decided in
February to improve relations with other European countries.
   Stalinist Albania's participation in the Belgrade meeting in
1988 was hailed as a first step in breaking out of its isolation.
   Earlier this year, Albanian officials accused Yugoslavia and
Greece of spreading unfounded reports of demonstrations in Albania,
apparently inspired by those which toppled Europe's other Communist
regimes.
   Delegates also discussed a proposal on freeing the Balkans of
nuclear and chemical weapons, and suggested that more talks be
held, the statement said.
   The Balkan states remain seriously divided over the treatment of
minority groups that overlap their borders. They also belong to
rival military alliances: Greece and Turkey are NATO members,
Bulgaria and Romania belong to the Warsaw Pact, and Yugoslavia and
Albania are independent.
   Greece is the only member of the European Community in the
Balkans.

<TEXT>
   The Pentagon today announced plans to expand
its role in the Bush administration's war on drugs by deploying a
wide array of warships, aircraft and communications equipments in
the Atlantic, Pacific and Caribbean.
   ``We will act swiftly, methodically and in accordance with our
nation's laws and traditions,'' Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said
in a prepared statement.
   Stephen M. Duncan, Cheney's coordinator of drug enforcement
policy, told a news conference the plan, as developed by regional
commanders, would cost nearly twice the $450 million appropriated
by Congress for Pentagon anti-drug efforts this year. He said the
services would have to ``cough up out of their hide'' the extra
funds.
   The administration has asked Congress to approve $1.2 billion in
Pentagon spending on the drug war next year.
   Duncan said the new strategy does not give the Defense
Department any new missions in the drug-interdiction effort, but
amounts to ``substantially more of the same'' kinds of actions the
military has been performing in recent years.
   ``We're not going to become a law enforcement agency,'' Duncan
said.
   Duncan outlined the following plans for increasing military
action in the drug war:
   _The U.S. Atlantic Command this year will use four or five Naval
ships daily expressly for tracking and stopping the flow of drugs
in international waters in the Caribbean and Atlantic. It
previously had none dedicated to this use. It also will increase
its use of Airborne Warning and Control Systems, or AWACS, aircraft.
   The Atlantic Command's use of ships in the drug war will
increase this year by 78 percent over 1989, as measured by days at
sea. Aircraft use, as measured by flight hours, will increase by
219 percent, Duncan said.
   _The U.S. Atlantic and Pacific commands each plan to use more
than eight classes of aircraft and six classes of ships for the
drug-interdiction strategy.
   The aircraft include E-2 Hawkeyes, P-3 Orions, F-4 Phantoms and
F-14 Tomcats. Ships include destroyers, frigates, guided missile
frigates, guided missile destroyers, aircraft carriers, patrol
hydrofoils and a variety of amphibious and logistic support ships.
   _The North Atlantic Aerospace Defense Command will use a network
of 44 ground radars designed to warn of high altitude penetrations
of U.S. airspace. It also will increase its patrol of the U.S.
southern border and coasts by using AWACS aircraft and 50
interceptor alert aircraft positioned at 25 locations nationwide.
   _All Pentagon anti-drug operations will be coordinated by the
Forces Command at Fort McPherson, Ga.
   Absent from the list of military actions is a proposal to
operate a U.S. naval flotilla off the coast of Colombia in search
of drug smugglers. In the wake of the U.S. invasion of Panama,
Colombian leaders balked at the proposal, which they said amounted
to a ``blockade.'' President Bush then withdrew the plan.

<BYLINE>By TERRY LEONARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italian Communists who have resolved to
create a new party focused Friday on how to achieve that goal and
avoid the perils it poses for their unity.
   Party leader Achille Occhetto has the votes he needs at the
party's extraordinary congress for the approval of his proposal to
revamp the party, a move that is expected to lead to a change of
its name and the elimination of its hammer and sickle symbol.
   But former party leader Alessandro Natta, one of the ``old
guard'' communists who led the campaign against creating a new
party, cautioned Occhetto and his followers not to take steps that
would split the West's largest Communist Party.
   Those who oppose the change will not estrange themselves from
the party, said Natta, but ``neither will they tolerate being put
aside.''
   Although Occhetto controls almost 67 percent of the 1,092
delegates, he still needs to negotiate with the impassioned
minority that fought against his proposal.
   Occhetto's proposal was sprurred by the collapse of communism in
eastern Europe and by his party's steady decline in both membership
and electoral strength. The Communists nearly came to power in 1976
when they won 34 percent of the vote, but they dropped to about 27
percent in the last parliamentary elections in 1987.
   Occhetto hopes a new party formation can help reverse the
membership and electoral slides, bring the party into the
mainstream of European socialism and challenge the domination of
the Christian Democrats and their allies in Italy by uniting the
country's fractured political left.
   But the entire plan could backfire if Occhetto only succeeds in
splitting his party of 1.4 million members. His opposition has come
from the old guard emotionally tied to ther name and symbol and
from young members who want a more militant party _ one that would,
for example, oppose Italy's membership in NATO.
   ``I have said that it would not displease me if ours remained
the only party in the world to call itself communist,'' Natta told
the delegates.
   ``The fight involves political questions and the most relevant
of these is the fate of the party. A change is possible but there
is no need to lower our flag,'' argued Natta.
   ``We in the minority believe that the Italian Communist party
has in itself the reasons, the resources and the capacity for a
renewal that will allow it to confront, in this historic phase, the
demands for the struggle for democracy and for the alternative (to
the Christian Democrats),'' Natta said later.
   While the plan to revamp the party is assured, the shape of that
new party and its name are uncertain. That will be left to the
party leadership, to be elected Sunday, who then will present their
proposals to another party congress for approval.
   The battle lines between Occhetto and his opponents at the
congress are drawn in committee rooms, where delegates are
considering the makeup of the leadership that will draft the
proposals for that next congress.
   Occhetto and his allies want to create a new executive body in
the party to streamline the decision-making. His opponents, who
have seen their numbers increase in the 300-member Central
Committee, want to keep the party structures as they are.
   One possible compromise would give Occhetto the new executive
body but one in which the ``no'' forces would still have a voice.
   Occhetto's allies repeatedly have stressed to the congress they
want to avoid any split in the party, but that they understand the
risks and want the direction of the new party to be determined by
all the members.
   ``We must decide to assume the responsibility of a courageous,
exceptional political initiative. None of us underestimates the
difficulties and the risks,'' said Giorgio Napolitano, an old guard
Communist who has supported Occhetto.
   In building the new party, said Napolitano, ``we must do our
work but in a free and open way. We need the support of everyone.''

   Lots of kids like to take their wheels and
go cruising late at night, but they usually start at a later age
than Candy Lewis' 3-year-old son.
   Police officer Jeff Lacey said he was riding on patrol at 3:45
a.m. Friday in the rural southwestern Ohio community when he
spotted the boy riding his tricycle.
   The tyke, who was not identified, had gotten up, dressed himself
and pushed a wooden table against the front door of his mobile home
so he could reach the latch and let himself out, Lacey said.
   ``He was just riding around,'' the officer said. ``He'd been
down a couple of streets and had gotten lost.''
   Lacey took the boy back to the police station. A few hours
later, a panicked Ms. Lewis telephoned police to report that her
child was gone when she awoke. Police promptly reunited the boy
with his mother. They did not release his name.

   When people have too much cash on hand they take
it to a bank. But what does a bank with too much money do?
   New England banks with money to burn send those megabucks to the
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
   The reserve bank's primary function is to be a banker for other
New England banks _ lending money to those that need it and storing
funds for those with excess cash, said Edward A. Romkey, an
assistant vice president of the bank. It also detects filthy lucre
_ worn and dirty bills _ and takes them out of circulation.
   New England banks usually have too much cash during the ski
season, summer vacations and Christmas, he said.
   ``Any time currency use is up, counterfeiting is up.
Counterfeiters have seasons, too,'' Romkey said. He said the bank
sends 200 to 300 fake bills daily to the Secret Service.
   The cash that arrives from New England banks is fed into eight
Currency Verification and Counting System machines, which process
72,000 greenbacks hourly.
   The machines scan the back of each bill much like a supermarket
scanner reads a bar code and decide whether it is real and in good
enough condition to go back into circulation. Clean bills get
counted and shrink-wrapped.
   Worn, torn and soiled bills _ about $1 million worth daily _ are
shredded into confetti and handed out to bank visitors.

   An unprecedented statement by President Bush
opposing the settlement of Soviet Jewish refugees in East Jerusalem
could make it more difficult for the Israeli Cabinet to approve
U.S. proposals for Mideast negotiations this weekend.
   By coupling East Jerusalem with the West Bank and Gaza as
off-limits to settlers, Bush appeared to question Israel's
retention of the predominantly Arab part of the city.
   All week, U.S. officials have danced around Bush's statement,
insisting there is no change in U.S. policy on Jerusalem or on the
West Bank and Gaza. They voiced approval of Jews living in both the
predominantly Jewish and mostly Arab parts of the city.
   But many questions were left unanswered. In fact, new questions
were raised.
   A White House statement on Jerusalem on Monday, for instance,
said U.S. policy ``backs the right of Jews as well as others to
live there in the context of a negotiated settlement.''
   That suggests Jews, who have lived in Jerusalem for more than
3,000 years, need Arab acquiescence to remain in the older part of
the city.
   On Friday, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, having
tried all week to persuade reporters there was no change in policy,
admitted: ``There are some words you can't use in describing this
policy and some words you can use.''
   The spokesman insisted ``there is no special motivation'' behind
the president's words. ``There was no special purpose or attention
there.''
   A twice-postponed showdown in the Israeli Cabinet is now set for
Sunday when the cabinet takes up a formula by Secretary of State
James A. Baker III that has split the conservative Likud and the
dovish Labor parties.
   Baker's goal is to have Israelis meet with Palestinians in Cairo
as the first step toward settlement. ``Without a dialogue between
Israelis and Palestinians we can never move forward to peace,'' he
said Tuesday.
   Baker's formula tries to bridge differences between Israel, on
the one hand, and Egypt and the Palestine Liberation Organization,
on the other. It would permit a Palestinian Arab resident of East
Jerusalem and one or two Palestinians deported by Israel from the
West Bank to participate in the talks.
   But Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and other leaders of
the Likud coalition are worried that might clear a way for the PLO
to dominate the agenda.
   Labor, on the other hand, is impatient to proceed with
negotiations.
   Amid this political debate, first Baker and then Bush made
statements that stirred controversy in Israel and may have hardened
Likud's resistance to the U.S. formula.
   Baker told a House subcommittee last week the administration
wanted assurances a U.S. $400 million housing loan guarantee would
not be used to settle Soviet Jewish refugees on the West Bank.
   Only about 100 of the thousands of Jews who have poured into
Israel have been settled on the West Bank. But their presence is
taken by the Arabs as evidence that Israel does not intend to
relinquish the territory.
   Baker's thrust at Shamir's settlement program irritated the
prime minister. And members of both Likud and Labor were upset by
Baker's statement at the same hearing that there is no evidence PLO
chairman Yasser Arafat is violating his December 1988 renunciation
of terrorism.
   Then, at a news conference Saturday in Palm Springs, Calif., the
president weighed in with a statement opposing new settlements on
the West Bank or in East Jerusalem.
   His intention may have been to discourage Israel from expanding
East Jerusalem to its suburbs and to settle Soviet Jews there.
   That would have been consistent with longstanding U.S. policy
against further Jewish settlements on the West Bank as an obstacle
to Mideast negotiations.
   But Bush, by linking East Jerusalem and the West Bank, may have
had something else in mind: that he considers East Jerusalem
occupied territory and Jews living there as settlers, as well.
   The President had not been asked about East Jerusalem, and his
statement upset Israelis who see the predominantly Arab part of
their capital and the West Bank as completely different.
   Many Israelis would surrender most of the West Bank as part of a
peace agreement with the Arabs. But very few would be willing to
relinquish any part of their capital.
   In more than two decades of U.S. diplomacy, Jerusalem and the
West Bank have been approached as separate issues. Jerusalem is
touchier, and American presidents and secretaries of state have
tried to keep their distance, usually by saying ambiguously that
the city should never be divided again _ and not saying whether
Israel ought to retain exclusive control over Jerusalem.
   Bush's statement is a problem, then.
   The White House and State Department tried on Wednesday to
soften its impact by asserting support for Jews living in Jerusalem
and insisting U.S. policy on the city and on the West Bank had not
changed.
   Maybe it has and maybe it hasn't. That depends on what Bush has
in mind.
   But gaining Israel's approval Sunday of Baker's formula for
negotiations is now tougher than ever.

   Popular singers from Hong Kong and Taiwan will
perform in six U.S. and Canadian cities in May to mobilize the
support of North American Chinese for human rights and the
pro-democracy movement in China, tour sponsors said Friday.
   The ``Concert for Democracy in China 1990'' tour will begin May
1 in Vancouver, British Columbia, and will include appearances in
Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and Toronto before ending May
12 at the Kennedy Center here.
   The tour is sponsored by the North American Coalition for
Chinese Democracy as part of worldwide observances of the first
anniversary of the Beijing government's massacre of pro-democracy
demonstrators in Tiananmen Square last June 4.
   Alex Wai of the Federation of Overseas Hong Kong Chinese in
Washington, one of the coalition's six North American tour
sponsors, said former Beijing student activist Wuer Kaixi will
speak at each concert.
   The list of entertainers includes singers Tayu Lo from Taiwan
and Maria Cordero, Deenie Ip, Cally Kwong, Tina Liu, Lowell Lo and
Danny Summer from Hong Kong. All are donating their services, Wai
said.
   Ticket sale proceeds from the Washington concert will be given
to the Tiananmen Memorial Foundation in New York and to the
40-member Washington federation for its human rights activities,
officials said.

   Police say a man who fired at 10 people
apparently picked his victims at random as he drove around the
city. A newspaper delivery man who was shot in the head died today
and seven others were injured.
   Police did not know what provoked the shooting spree Thursday
morning.
   ``It's just a completely senseless, random shooting,'' Police
Lt. Mike McKenna. ``This was an unprovoked attack on each of these
individuals.''
   William F. Brown, 41, died today at HCA Wesley Medical Center.
An employee of The Wichita Eagle, Brown was shot as he was stocking
a coin-operated newspaper box outside a restaurant.
   Police surrounded the gunman's red Volvo and arrested him after
he pulled into a fast-food restaurant. Police found a bomb and a
fresh carcass of a goose in the suspect's car. The bomb was later
detonated.
   McKenna said the man, who had not been charged, was sent to a
hospital for a mental evaluation. He said there had been several
complaints about the man's violence in the past.
   There were at least 10 shooting incidents in east Wichita in a
little more than an hour starting around 4:30 a.m., McKenna said.
Two people were hit by bullets and the rest by flying glass, police
said.
   Lee Bunch was heading for work when he noticed a red Volvo with
its bright lights on following close behind. At an intersection,
Bunch said, he looked toward the driver.
   ``He had a revolver pointed at my head. I took off and he
followed me ... The bullet hit my left rear window and passed
through and blew out my right passenger window,'' Bunch said. ``I
believe it just missed my head.''

   Leaders of Venezuala and Spain urged
Vice President Dan Quayle today to press for rapid disbanding of
the Contras, saying Nicaragua's Sandinista government should be
trusted to give up power, U.S. officials said.
   Quayle stated the U.S. position that the Contras should disband
but that their security must be ensured first, said a U.S. official
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In what one official called ``kind of a rolling summit on
Nicaragua,'' Quayle's talks with Venezuelan President Carlos Andres
Perez came between Perez's meeting yesterday with incoming
Nicaragaun President Violeta Chamorro and Saturday's arrival in
Caracas of outgoing President Daniel Ortega.
   They are disacussing how a peaceful transfer of power can occur
with the Sandinistas still in control of the 70,000-man Nicaraguan
army and the Contra rebels massed at the Honduran border.
   Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez also met with Quayle and
Perez today. He was in Venezuela en route to Chile. More talks on
Nicaragua were expected when Gonzalez takes Ortega and Perez and
Costa Rican President Oscar Arias to Sunday's Chilean inaugural,
the U.S. official said.
   Quayle's aides had said the Perez talks would focus on President
Bush's push to gain acceptance for the U.S.-installed governmment
in Panama. But the morning's talks were solely on Nicaragua.
   U.S. officials said Perez has been helping diplomatically to
influence other South American nations to accept the government of
Panamanian President Guillermo Endara.
   Perez, following Endara's March 1 announcement that he would
hold a vote on the Panamanian constitution, said he would normalize
relations with Panama. Venezuela was joined by Colombia, Argentina,
Peru and Ecuador in moving to accept Endara's government.
   The countries that remain to be convinced include Brazil,
Uruguay, Mexico and Chile.
   Quayle, whose trip also will include attendance at inaugurations
Sunday in Chile and Thursday in Brazil, left shortly after daybreak
today from Andrews Air Force Base outside of Washington.
   In briefing foreign reporters on the eve of his departure,
Quayle offered no specifics on what the United States can do to
help the Latin countries with their massive debt and inflation
problems.
   He said he wanted to hear ideas on trade and economic
development from those countries' heads of state.
   ``It's very important to solicit their ideas,'' Quayle said.
``At times the United States gets accused, perhaps justifiably so,
of lecturing. I'm not visiting Latin America to lecture. I'm
visiting Latin America to listen, to get their ideas.''
   He said the administration is prepared to turn its attention
more to economic affairs in the hemisphere, now that democratic
elections have sparked political reform in country after country
previously ruled by dictators.
   ``Political development has been successful in the hemisphere,
but we have not been as successful as we'd like on economic
development,'' Quayle told reporters.
   Brazil's $115 billion foreign debt is the largest in the
developing world. Argentina is beset by demonstrations and strikes
resulting from its 8,000 percent inflation rate.
   There has been little progress, except in Mexico, on the Bush
administration's so-called Brady Plan to ease Latin American debt
by getting commercial banks to forgive outstanding loans.
   The other goal of Quayle's trip _ seeking acceptance of the
Panamanian government installed when the U.S. invasion toppled Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega _ still faces resistance. Both Chile and
Brazil refused to invite Panamanian representatives to their
inaugurations.
   In Brazil, ``It is likely that the new government will examine
the matter in a new light,'' said one Brazilian diplomat, referring
to the upcoming inauguration of Fernando Collor de Mello.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., is accompanying Quayle as part of
the U.S. delegation to the Chile inauguration of Patricio Aylwin.
   Kennedy was a leading critic of human rights violations under
outgoing Chilean President Gen. Agosto Pinochet.
   Quayle will meet with Pinochet, who insisted on retaining
control of the country's 60,000-man army even though he will not be
president.
   Nicaragua's outgoing President Daniel Ortega, defeated in Feb.
25 elections by the U.S.-backed candidate Violeta Chamorro, also
plans to attend the Chile inaugural. While U.S. officials have
refused to meet with Ortega or representatives of his Marxist
regime, the vice president now would have no objections to such a
meeting, said Beckwith. However, he added that Nicaraguan officials
had not sought a meeting.

   Dr. Antonia Novello was sworn in Friday as the
nation's surgeon general, and President Bush made it clear he
expects no letup in the anti-smoking and anti-drug abuse crusades
of her predecessors.
   In a brief White House ceremony, Bush saluted both the new
appointee and Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan,
himself a fervent critic of tobacco use.
   ``My respect and appreciation of my good friend Lou Sullivan
grows every day as he fights for the good health of our people,''
Bush said. ``In the few minutes we've been here, 11 people have
died from smoking, 390,000 people each year.''
   Novello declared her motto would be ``good science and good
sense,'' and thanked President Bush for an appointment she said
should be an inspiration to women and minorities.
   ``The American dream is well and alive,'' Novello, the first
woman and first Hispanic to serve as surgeon general, said at a
White House ceremony. ``Once a dream, it is now my pledge: to be a
good doctor for all who live in this great country.''
   Novello, who succeeds C. Everett Koop, is a pediatrician who has
specialized on AIDS and kidney disease in children.
   The surgeon general officially is the leader of the 6,500 member
Public Health Service, but Koop and others have used the post as a
bully pulpit to influence government policy on smoking, AIDS and
other health-related issues.
   Bush also mentioned drug and alcohol abuse and AIDS as among the
challenges facing Novello. ``The tasks ahead are difficult,'' he
said. ``Because so many of these problems begin with our children,
it is only right that we ask a pediatrician to help.''
   Novello, 44, is a native of Puerto Rico. On hand for the
ceremony was the governor of Puerto Rico, Rafael Hernandez Colon,
who told Bush, ``I'm here representing the pride of all the people
of Puerto Rico at this moment.''

<HEAD>Lithuania in Weekend Showdown with Kremlin</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lithuania's newly elected lawmakers pressed on
toward a showdown with Moscow, caucusing Friday on how to take the
reins of power after the declaration of independence expected by
parliament this weekend.
   A secession vote by the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet would confront
Mikhail S. Gorbachev with what could be his greatest crisis: the
breaking away of one of the 15 Soviet republics, with the
possibility of the rest of the multinational empire following suit.
   ``Moscow is menacing us. We hope it's only with words,'' said
Anderus Kubilus, secretary of Sajudis, Lithuania's pro-independence
movement. ``We don't think there will be an acute economic
blockade. It wouldn't be profitable for them, either economically
or in terms of international opinion. But we don't know.''
   However, in comments reported Wednesday by official Radio
Vilnius, Gorbachev appeared to accept Lithuania's right to secede,
although cautioning that the once independent state on the Baltic
Sea would have to pay $34 billion in compensation for factories
built and money invested during a half-century of Soviet rule.
   With the legislature's opening session scheduled for Saturday
night, secession activists reported from the capital of Vilnius
that the stance of Lithuanian President and Communist Party leader
Algirdas Brazauskas was still unclear.
   As chairman of the 141-seat chamber, Brazauskas conceivably
could stave off immediate confrontation with the Kremlin by using
his office to delay debate on the secession issue, which is
expected to begin Sunday.
   ``His position is that we should act step by step, that there's
no need to do it hastily,'' Alvydas Medalinskas, Sajudis executive
director, said by telephone. He said Brazauskas' most recent
appearance on state-run Lithuanian TV Wednesday showed his position
has not changed.
   Kubilus, however, noted that the Presidium of the Supreme
Soviet, or legislature, that Brazauskas heads has included the
independence issue on the legislative agenda, which he took to be a
sign of tacit support from the Lithuanian leader who masterminded
his Communist Party's December declaration of independence from the
Soviet party that Gorbachev heads.
   Forcing the pace, the governing council of Sajudis declared the
independence issue ``cannot be delayed'' and called on the incoming
legislature to restore the sovereignty lost in 1940 when Red Army
tanks rolled in.
   The statement, issued after the Sajudis council met Thursday,
carried enormous clout, since candidates supported by the
grassroots nationalist movement won at least two-thirds of the
seats in the Supreme Soviet in elections that began Feb. 24.
   In response to a call from Sajudis, election committees moved up
the dates of runoffs so the new legislature could convene before
the national Congress of People's Deputies, which is to meet in
Moscow on Monday, can confer vastly greater presidential powers on
Gorbachev that activists in the Soviet republics say would imperil
their campaigns for sovereignty.
   The Lithuanian legislature will be asked to reaffirm the 1918
act that declared the West Virginia-sized state independent. On
Feb. 7, lawmakers voided Lithuania's 1940 incorporation into the
Soviet Union, calling it illegal, so the incoming parliament will
vote on ``a restoration of statehood,'' Kubilus said.
   They will also be asked to restore the 1938 Constitution that
was swept away by Josef Stalin's Kremlin in favor of a Soviet-style
law.
   Anticipating the vote, a commission of newly elected deputies
representing the KGB, police and Lithuanian lawyers met Friday to
work out proposals on how to handle defense, law enforcement and
security in an independent Lithuania, Medalinskas said.
   ``There are big preparations under way to assume power,'' said
Kubilus.
   A commission of the outgoing legislature has prepared proposals
for an independent economy, but Medalinskas said further
negotiations on that score were expected with Moscow.
   In remarks reported by the official Tass news agency, Lithuanian
economist Bronislovas Zaikauskas, an adviser to the republic's
government, said his homeland, poor in natural resources, could
exploit its location on the Soviet Union's western fringe to become
a ``trampoline'' for Western firms seeking entry to the Soviet
market.
   Official Soviet statistics show Lithuania imports $2.5 billion
more in goods from the other Soviet republics than what it exports.
But Zaikauskas pointed out the illogic of a state-run economy where
the most industrially developed Soviet republics _ Lithuania and
its Baltic neighbors of Estonia and Latvia _ run a debt with the
rest of the country.
   Opposition to the independence declaration from ethnic
minorities living in Lithuania was likely, but Medalinskas said
there have been no recent statements from the ethnic Russian-led
Intermovement or a rump faction of the Communist Party still loyal
to Moscow.
   Ethnic Lithuanians make up 80 percent of the republic's 3.7
million population, with Russians totaling 9 percent and Poles 7
percent.
   Independence will also be on the agenda in Estonia this weekend
as the so-called Estonian Congress convenes Sunday in Tallinn, the
republic's capital, to discuss negotiations with Moscow.
   The 499-member non-governmental body represents people who lived
in Estonia before the 1940 Soviet takeover and their descendents.
The delegates will cooperate with Estonia's legislature on
independence ``and are determined to press Moscow for the soonest
possible settlement of the issue,'' said Tonis Avikson, a spokesman
for the Estonian People's Front.

   Oliver North took the stand as the leadoff
witness at the Iran-Contra trial of John Poindexter today and
grudgingly admitted he ran a secret Contra resupply operation on
orders from Poindexter and others.
   North, testifying as a ``hostile witness'' for the
prosecution,'' acknowledged that he controlled the covert Contra
supply operation and said he ``never'' acted on his own.
   ``At no time, as you were running your operation, you never
tried to conceal or hide what you were doing from either Admiral
Poindexter or Robert McFarlane?'' prosecutor Dan Webb asked.
   ``I did not,'' the retired Marine lieutenant colonel said.
   ``Were you ever trying to direct that operation on you own,
independent or your superiors?'' Webb asked.
   ``Never,'' North replied.
   ``Didn't you keep them apprised of all of your Contra-related
activities?'' Webb asked.
   ``Yes,'' North said.
   Prosecutors called North to the stand to butress their
contention that he worked with Poindexter to cover up the
Iran-Contra affair. Poindexter is charged with conspiracy, two
counts of obstructing Congress and two counts of making false
statements to cover up North's military assistance and fund-raising
for the Contras and U.S. knowledge of a 1985 shipment of Hawk
missiles from Israel to Iran.
   On Thursday, Poindexter's lawyer said the former national
security adviser may be guilty of bad memory but did not
deliberately lie to Congress about secret arms shipments to Iran.
   Today, North initially denied that he controlled the Contra
resupply operation, in which retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard
Secord played a key role.
   ``To say that Secord worked under my direction would say a major
general is working for a lieutenant colonel and I don't think
that's accurate,'' North testified.
   Webb then handed North a copy of testimony he gave at his own
trial last year in which North was asked who gave Secord his orders.
   ``I suppose I did,'' North replied at the time.
   Asked again by Webb whether he had run the operation, North
replied:
   ``I gave him a lot of requests and if you want to call it
direction and guidance I guess that's what we're stuck with.''
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene at one point referred to
North as ``a hostile witness'' and gave Webb permission to ask
leading questions of the former White House aide.
   Quoting from North's earlier testimony at his trial, Webb asked
if ``the ball'' had been passed to North in terms of taking care of
the Contras' needs after Congress prohibited the CIA from providing
it.
   ``I don't recall those specific words,'' North said, but later
conceding he had said ``words to that effect.''
   North's role as overseer of the Contras' needs beginning in late
1984 took place while Poindexter was the deputy to Robert
McFarlane, who was national security adviser at the time.
   ``Was Admiral Poindexter one of your superiors?'' asked Webb.
   ``In that general time frame he was one of the people who
assigned me to'' assist the Contras, replied North.
   Defense attorney Richard Beckler has denied that Poindexter
engaged in a criminal coverup of the Iran-Contra affair, declaring
that he was acting under President Reagan's orders.
   Beckler said Congress was fully informed of North's secret
Contra resupply network and that Poindexter labored to provide
Congress the story of the Reagan administration's Iran initiative
once it became public during November 1986.
   ``Why would anybody have to hide and deceive?'' asked Beckler.
``The answer is that Poindexter didn't have to hide. The answer is
there was nothing illegal.''
   Earlier Thursday, Webb said, ``John Poindexter and Oliver North
decided to rewrite the history of the Iran-Contra affair'' through
a conspiracy of ``coverup, deception and concealment.''
   Poindexter and North tried to cover up the 1985 shipment of Hawk
missiles to Iran and the diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan
rebels to ``avoid tarnishment of the Reagan administration,'' Webb
said.
   But Beckler told the jury Poindexter simply forgot when he gave
incorrect information to members of the House and Senate
intelligence committees about his involvement in the November 1985
Hawks shipment.
   The then-national security adviser told the congressional
committees that he found out about the delivery in January 1986,
when in fact he had known of the shipment at the time it occurred.
   ``After 30 years in the U.S. Navy and the White House they want
to nail him on a five-week mistake'' for obstruction and making
false statements to Congress,'' Beckler told the jury, nearly
shouting.
   Hours after making the alleged false statements, Poindexter tore
up a politically embarrassing presidential paper that depicted U.S.
involvement in Iran arms sales as a straight arms-for-hostages
deal. The December 1985 finding retroactively authorized the
November 1985 CIA-assisted shipment of Hawks from Israel to Iran.
   ``Sometimes you do things to protect'' the president, Beckler
said. ``When you work for the president of the United States, part
of your job is ... to protect the president.''
   ``What was driving this man was not a conspiracy, but ... the
orders of the president of the United States,'' said Beckler. ``He
met with him sometimes seven days a week, sometimes four, five and
six times a day. And he was carrying out the policies of the United
States and that is what this case is about. It is not about
criminality.''
   North met with members of Congress on Aug. 6, 1986, and denied
assisting the Contras militarily. Poindexter later sent a message
telling his aide, ``Well done.''
   Prosecutor Webb told jurors that North lied at Poindexter's
direction during the Aug. 6 meeting. Webb said Poindexter later
congratulated North on lies that the prosecutor said ``worked like
a charm.''

Discovery when it is launched next month, the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration said.
   The industry magazine, Aviation Week and Space Technology, said
``the phantom head, as it is officially designated, was mounted on
the right wall of the shuttle middeck near the lower end of an
astronaut sleeping bag.''
   For the experiment, the skull was sliced apart, filled with more
than 100 instruments, reassembled and covered with a plastic
material formulated to act like human skin.
   Researchers needed an actual human skull to obtain the best data
on how much space radiation penetrates the head, according to
Aviation Week.
   The magazine quoted a Johnson Space Center document as saying
that ``it is anticipated that a full torso will be flown in future
shuttle missions'' to determine how much of a radiation dose the
body gets during space flight.
   The tests are for use in planning extended space station
missions and lengthy stays on the moon and Mars.
   Aviation Week said the skull was provided by the Air Force and
came from someone who had willed it to science. Researchers assumed
it was from a woman because of its small size.

   Gerald Wallace, younger brother of
former Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace, was fined $100,000 Friday
and given a suspended two-year prison sentence for income tax
evasion.
   He also was placed on five years' probation.
   Wallace, 68, a once influential lawyer who is suffering from
cancer, pleaded guilty in October to two counts of failing to
report $165,195 in federal taxes for 1984 and 1985.
   U.S. District Judge Joel Dubina ordered Wallace to pay the first
$20,000 of the fine by the end of March and the rest within five
years, though he doubted Wallace would be able to repay the full
amount.
   ``I have heard you are the most powerful man in Alabama,'' the
judge said. ``I don't know if that is true, but it is a tragedy to
see you before me.''

   Will Steger and five fellow adventurers
who completed a seven-month, 3,800-mile trek across Antarctica on
skis and dogsleds said they had a hair-raising time getting off the
frozen continent.
   Lifeboats carrying the team to a waiting Soviet ship at Mirnyy
on the Indian Ocean coast of Antarctica had to dodge ice floes when
an iceberg split apart Thursday.
   ``The most dangerous part of the expedition was getting here and
getting out,'' Steger said from Mirnyy. ``Thank God we didn't lose
anyone.''
   The six men, 29 sled dogs, two dog handlers and 13 journalists
were loaded by ropes down a steep, icy embankment into the
lifeboats. For the mushers, it was their first time off the ice
since arriving by Soviet airplane at King George Island on the
continent's western tip last July.
   Steger, who is from the Minnesota town of Ely, was a co-leader
of the St. Paul-based expedition.

   Sir David Lean, the 81-year-old
director whose films have won 27 Academy Awards, says his ``Life
Achievement Award'' from the American Film Institute took him by
surprise.
   Lean, director of such classics as ``The Bridge on the River
Kwai'' and ``Lawrence of Arabia,'' said he never thought of himself
``as anything so special.''
   But actors and directors including Anjelica Huston, Martin
Scorsese, Gene Kelly and Gregory Peck were fulsome in their praise
at Thursday night's tribute.
   Lean chuckled through it all. If anybody had told him when he
started in the business that he was going to be a director, he
said, ``I would think they were mad.''
   Previous winners include Peck, Kelly, Jimmy Stewart, John Huston
and Alfred Hitchcock.

   Attorneys for comedian Bill Cosby and his
wife, Camille, pressed a judge for an early start to the bankruptcy
trial of the couple's fired business manager.
   They said they wanted to prevent her from depleting assets
estimated at $10 million.
   Cosby, once called ``the richest man in show business'' by
Forbes Magazine, claims Mary Waller cheated him out of more than
$8.5 million, court records show.
   After heated arguments Thursday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur
Greenwald ordered attorneys to return Tuesday, when he would decide
the trial date.
   The lawyers are arguing whether fraud and embezzlement
allegations brought by the Cosbys merit an early trial.
   The trial will decide whether Ms. Waller can manage her own
assets while she reorganizes under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code, or whether her estate should be placed under a
court-appointed trustee.
   Ms. Waller, 46, recently filed for bankruptcy protection after
eight years serving as chief financial officer to the Cosbys.
   She was earning $1 million annually when fired in July,
according to the Cosbys. Cosby says Ms. Waller misspent millions of
the couple's money, buying among other things, a $44,551 Range
Rover automobile and $28,610 in jewelry.
   She denies the allegations.

   A ranch owned by actress Greer Garson would
become a national park under a bill introduced in Congress by three
New Mexico lawmakers.
   Sens. Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici and Rep. Bill Richardson
said the bill introduced Thursday would allow the National Park
Service to preserve and interpret the history of the entire Pecos
area near Las Vegas, N.M.
   The planned Pecos National Historical Park would stand on what
is now the 5,865-acre Forked Lightning Ranch owned by Ms. Garson.
It would include the 25-year-old Pecos National Monument, which
includes a village dating from the Pecos Pueblo Indians of 1450,
the lawmakers said.
   ``The many prehistoric and historic resources located on the
Forked Lightning Ranch would add significantly to the Pecos
National Park,'' Richardson said.
   Negotiations were under way for the land, which may be purchased
by a third party and then donated to the federal government, he
said. Under the legislation, land may be bought, exchanged or
donated.
   Ms. Garson recently halted negotiations to sell the land to a
developer after learning of its plans to create a resort.

<HEAD>State Department Charges Sandinistas With Post-Election Abuses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department called on Nicaragua's
defeated Sandinista government on Friday to cease alleged abuses of
government resources and fully cooperate in a transition of power.
   Margaret Tutwiler, the department spokeswoman, said that actions
by the Sandinista legislature to drop charges on unprosecuted
crimes and provide a legal basis for the party's confiscation of
state property contradict promises made by President Daniel Ortega
after his defeat by President-elect Violetas Chamorro.
   ``Throughout their 10-year rule and during the election
campaign, the Sandinistas made no distinction between state and
party resources,'' she said.
   ``Now they are trying to provide a legal sanction for their
abuse of government property,'' Ms Tutwiler said.
   ``Meanwhile, reports flood in about Sandinista theft of
government office equipment and other state resources,'' she said
and added:
   ``If the Sandinistas are serious about respecting a popular
mandate, as President Ortega has promised, they will cease these
actions immediately and cooperate with the incoming government to
ensure a smooth transition.''
   Since the Sandinistas' Feb. 25 election defeat by the United
National Opposition, known as UNO, there have been numerous reports
of citizens being armed and trained for combat in ``sovereignty
battalions'' by the governing leftist party.
   Opposition leaders express concern over a Sandinista bill
introduced this week in the legislature that would would absolve
anyone of crimes committed through the end of March.
   The law would apply to crimes committed between July 19, 1979,
the day of the victory of the Sandinista revolution that overthrew
dictator Anastasio Somoza, and March 31.

<HEAD>State Officials Don't Like Bush Transportation Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROGER PETTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Many state and local officials aren't buying President Bush's
proposed national transportation policy, which would shift more of
the cost to states. One critic called the proposal ``all flash and
no cash.''
   The critics are demanding release of billions of dollars from
the Highway and Aviation trust funds.
   ``The states are going to have to do their part and we are, but
the federal government has got to do its part. It's got to be a
partnership,'' said Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who lost to
Bush in the 1988 presidential election.
   But some hailed it for giving the states greater freedom.
   ``The president's policy offers excellent promise for future
transportation decision-making and gives states more flexibility
over control of federally assisted projects, and it encourages use
of innovative financing by the states,'' said Illinois Gov. James
R. Thompson, a Republican.
   The administration plan, ``Moving America Into The 21st
Century,'' calls for more toll roads, local gas taxes, user fees,
private investments, competition, deregulation, research into
futuristic systems and openness to foreign air carriers as well as
increased attention to safety and protection of the environment.
   The policy, unveiled Thursday by Bush and Transportation
Secretary Samuel Skinner, contains no strategy to increase federal
funding beyond what's already in the president's budget.
   Thompson said he agreed with user fees, but added that ``it is
essential that the users have confidence that their fees are going
to be used, promptly, for improvements to the transportation
system. As a result, I emphasize again the need to spend down trust
fund balances as quickly as practical to put user fee revenue to
work on transportation projects.''
   Arnold Oliver, engineer-director of Texas' Department of
Highways and Public Transportation, said his agency is ``very
concerned about shifting the financial burden.''
   ``We're already stretched to the limit,'' Oliver said.
   ``The president had a chance to hit a home run for
transportation by agreeing to spend some of the $23 billion already
collected in the Highway and Aviation Trust Funds. But being held
hostage to reduce the federal deficit, he missed the ball on that
one. But hopefully the game isn't over,'' said James Pitz, director
of the Michigan Department of Transportation.
   Hal Rives, commissioner of the Georgia Department of
Transportation, said $66 billion is spent on highways across the
country each year and the federal government only pays $12 billion.
   ``We're already paying the larger share. It's time for the
federal government to back up what they need with federal money,
and they have the money,'' he said, referring to the trust funds
based on taxes on fuel and airline tickets.
   Robert R. Kiley, chairman of New York City's Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, also blasted the proposed reduction of
federal spending on transportation.
   ``Reading this policy, you would never know we have serious
congestion and infrastructure decay problems which need to be
boldly addressed,'' Kiley said. ``Like the national education and
national drug policies, this is another case of all flash and no
cash.''
   Washington state officials said the proposal could mean higher
taxes will be needed to fund transportation improvements in the
state.
   Washington state lawmakers last week approved a $1.1 billion tax
increase over five years for transportation, including a 4-cent
gas-tax increase this year and another penny in 1991. At 22 cents a
gallon, Washington's tax will be among the highest in the nation.
   In Massachusetts, Dukakis repeated his call for the Legislature
to increase the state's gasoline tax, now at 11 cents a gallon one
of the nation's lowest.
   Tennessee Gov. Ned McWherter has backed increased taxes for
transportation and the state gasoline tax has been raised from 14
to 21 cents per gallon over the past six years, said his spokesman,
Ken Renner.
   ``At the same time, Tennesseans have been paying federal taxes
that go into the Highway Trust Fund and the Aviation Trust Fund and
the governor believes it is time that the money in these funds is
spent for the purposes for which it is intended,'' Renner said.

<HEAD>Aoun Calls for Peace with Rival Christian and Moslem Leaders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Michel Aoun appealed Friday for an
end to Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war, making a conciliatory move
to Moslem leaders and a Christian warlord he has tried to crush in
more than a month of battles.
   Aoun also dropped his outright opposition to the peace accord
and power sharing agreement worked out by Lebanon's parliament in
October.
   Police said a week-old cease-fire between Aoun's 19,000 troops
and the 6,000-member Lebanese Forces militia of Samir Geagea was
holding despite minor exchanges of sniper fire.
   At least 750 people were killed and 2,089 wounded during the
inconclusive showdown between the two forces for mastery of the
310-square-mile Christian enclave.
   In another development, police said rival Shiite Moslem militias
loyal to Syria and Iran clashed in south Beirut and south Lebanon,
but there were no reports of casualties.
   The police spokesman said Syrian troops moved in and disengaged
Shiite zealots of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, and
fighters of the mainstream Shiite Amal militia in south Beirut's
seaside district of Ouzai.
   In south Lebanon's Iqlim el-Tuffah province, the two factions
dueled with howitzers and mortars, the police spokesman said.
   The Shiite clashes came two days after a Beirut firefight
between the two groups that left two people dead and three wounded.
   The two factions have been fighting sporadically for more than
two years for dominance among Shiites, the nation's largest sect.
   The war between the two Shiite militias has left 1,030 people
dead and 3,046 wounded.
   Also Friday, Israeli warplanes attacked a Palestinian guerrilla
base near the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli in the first raid
in the region in nearly five years, the Israeli military said.
   A guerrilla group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command, said six Israeli warplanes rocketed one
of its naval bases, killing two guerrillas and wounding a Lebanese
farmer.
   The bases hit served as ``launching points'' for attacks on
Israel by the guerrilla group, the Israeli military said.
   The military did not point to a specific attack blamed on
Jibril's militia. While Israel frequently attacks guerrilla bases
in south Lebanon in retaliation for attacks on or near the
Israeli-Lebanese border, the raid in northern Lebanon was unusual.
   It was the eighth air raid this year by Israeli jets against
targets in Lebanon.
   Aoun, in an unusually conciliatory statement to the newspaper
An-Nahar, said there will be no more clashes among Christians or
between Christians and Moslems.
   Aoun told An-Nahar he wanted ``dialogue with everyone'' to find
a settlement to more than a month of clashes between his troops and
Geagea's militia.
   He stressed there will be ``no more clashes'' in the Christian
enclave or along the areas separating Christian territory with the
Moslem sectors.
   The general also dropped his rejection of an Arab League peace
plan brokered last year in the Saudi Arabian city of Taif.
   ``Abrogating the Taif accord is not necessary to launch a
dialogue,'' Aoun said.
   He did call, however, for unspecified amendments to the plan.
   Aoun originally rejected the accord because it did not include a
timetable for the withdrawal of Syria's 40,000 troops from Lebanon.
   Aoun's army and Geagea's militia fought each other to a
standstill before accepting a cease-fire on March 3 called by a
mediation committee of three independent Christian figures.
   The committee said Friday it was holding a series of meetings
with Aoun, Geagea and Maronite Catholic Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir
to ``consolidate the cease-fire and move into addressing the
political reasons for the crisis.'' It did not elaborate.
   Aoun and Geagea are Maronites, the Catholic community that has
dominated political life in Lebanon since its independence from
France in 1943.
   Aoun described the inconclusive intra-Christian showdown as
``self destructive'' and called on Geagea to declare his
``readiness for dialogue so we can meet.''
   ``Once two people manage to meet, they can invite others,'' Aoun
said. The statement was considered to be an invitation to Moslem
leaders to meet with him and discuss a settlement to the civil war.
   Moslems have been demanding political reforms giving them an
equal share in Lebanon's political life.
   The Taif accord called for distributing government and
parliamentary seats equally among Moslems and Christians.

   Venezuela and Spain on Friday told Vice
President Dan Quayle the United States should trust Nicaragua's
outgoing Sandinista government to peacefully give up power and
should hasten demobilization of the Contra rebels, U.S. officials
said.
   In what one aide described as ``a kind of rolling summit on
Nicaragua and the peaceful transfer of power,'' Quayle met with
Venezuela's President Carlos Andres Perez the day after incoming
Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro met with Perez. President
Daniel Ortega is also due to arrive in Venezuela on Saturday.
   Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez joined the talks Friday,
as did Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who is accompanying Quayle
to Sunday's presidential inauguration in Chile.
   Kennedy told the Latin leaders there's considerable skepticism
in Congress about Ortega and they ``should not put confidence
totally in Ortega,'' said U.S. officials who were in the meeting.
   Quayle concurred, stressing the United States prefers to trust
Mrs. Chamorro. He said the Bush administration also wants the
Contras to disband but said their security must be ensured.
   Quayle, on the first day of a week-long trip to the region,
spoke by telephone with Mrs. Chamorro Friday morning from Air Force
Two.
   U.S. officials said all agreed further negotiations are needed
on the transfer of power and demobilizing the rebels before Mrs.
Chamorro's April 25 inauguration.
   More talks were expected when the Spanish prime minister travels
in his plane from Caracas with Ortega, Perez and Costa Rican
President Oscar Arias to Sunday's inauguration.
   Spain and Venezuela agreed with Quayle that they should provide
trade and economic aid to help rebuild Nicaragua's languishing
economy.
   Perez and Gonzalez insisted the Contras pose a potential
security problem for the elected Chamorro government, but Quayle
noted there have also been attacks since the Feb. 25 election by
roaming bands of Sandinista supporters.
   ``We all agree the Contras should be demobilized,'' one official
said, adding, ``There has to be a process but the security of the
Contras has to be guaranteed.''
   Quayle was flying to Barbados later Friday.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's defense minister urged army
officers Friday to try to halt a decline in morale in the
once-feared front-line force of the Warsaw Pact.
   ``I have asked my commanders to ensure duties are carried out by
the book,'' Adm. Theodor Hoffmann said at a news conference.
   The East German army has been facing a drain on human resources
and declining morale and readiness since the hard-line Communist
leadership fell in October and borders to the West were opened,
according to military sources and Western officials.
   Hoffmann described Western reports that his troops had lost as
many as 80,000 soldiers, or 50 percent of the active force, as
``exaggerated,'' contending instead that between 500 and 1,000
mainly young soldiers had deserted.
   He stressed that most were doing their duty conscientiously, but
added: ``The number of young people leaving this land is high, and
that includes soldiers.''
   He said troops' worries about their future had prompted many to
opt for migration to West Germany.
   ``The question (they) always ask is ... `What's going to happen
to us?''' he said. Hoffmann added he was concerned about reports he
had received that recruits had burned their military ID cards and
refused to take part in exercises.
   ``We can't say we're totally satisfied when soldiers are
demonstrating and refusing to carry out orders ... a new motivation
must be built up,'' Hoffmann said.
   Other Defense Ministry sources have put the number of deserters
in the thousands.
   According to Hoffmann, 130,000 soldiers were in active military
service, with an extra 12,000 performing special duties in the
economy and health services, also ailing since the Communist ouster.
   He said 28,000 soldiers, who had taken planned retirement, made
up the difference to what officially is a 170,000-man fighting
force.
   Army officials from East Germany's Warsaw Pact allies had
privately expressed concern about the reports of flagging
discipline, but had made no official complaints.
   As the Germanys move toward unification, Hoffmann said he
supported a united Germany's membership in a European security
system that would embrace East and West and surpass the Warsaw Pact
and NATO as military alliances.
   The West insists that a single Germany adhere to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, while the Communist-led East German
interim government, backed by the Kremlin, has ruled out NATO
membership.
   Hoffmann, a member of the Communist Party who is likely to be
replaced as minister after March 18 elections vote in a new
government and parliament, said he looked forward to working with
what would probably be his civilian successor.
   He said East Germany could replace conscription with a voluntary
professional army and recommended both German armies should
increase cooperation in coordinating activities such as disaster
clean-ups and other emergency operations.

<HEAD>White House Says Hostage Hoax Embarrassing but Shows Bush Concern</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush's phone conversation with an
impostor claiming to be Iran's president was ``a little
embarrassing'' but underscored his commitment to winning the
release of U.S. hostages in Lebanon, Bush's spokesman said Friday.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush believed
the contact, purportedly from Hashemi Rafsanjani, was probably a
hoax but decided to involve himself anyway on the chance that it
wasn't.
   ``The president's feeling was: `What if it's real? And I want
the American people to know, and the families of the hostages to
know, that I am willing to check out every possibility,'''
Fitzwater said.
   A caller identifying himself as an Iranian official phoned the
White House several weeks ago and asserted that the Iranian
president wanted to discuss the hostages with Bush, administration
officials said.
   Bush spoke to the impostor during a second phone call. White
House officials declined to go into details of the conversation.
``Suffice it to say it was a hoax phone call and that's all that
matters,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said the administration does not know who initiated the hoax
and could not rule out the possibilty that it might have originated
within a faction of the Iranian government.
   Rafsanjani, meanwhile, ridiculed Bush in a sermon broadcast on
Tehran radio. ``Can it be that such a global power, with all its
intelligence capabilities, talks to a person it cannot identify?''
he asked. ``This is a strange occurrence.''
   The Iranian leader said the episode showed how important Iran
was to the United States and added that it was ``God's grace'' that
U.S. officials had not been able to make contact with him.
   Fitzwater's statement said Rafsanjani's statement ``reflects the
difficulty of the situation: One day we hear moderate points of
view, the next day we hear antagonistic ones.''
   ``Our position remains steadfast: We want to do everything we
can to get the hostages out. The president will talk to anyone, any
time,'' Fitzwater added.
   Was Bush, with his reputation for nonstop telephone diplomacy,
angered by the hoax? ``No, actually the president thinks it's
probably useful to have the American people know he's willing to
follow up on these kinds of things,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``While hoax phone calls are always a little embarrassing and
difficult to deal with ... it's important to the hostage families
to know that President Bush's policy is firm but he is personally
committed to follow up every opportunity to get release of the
hostages,'' the spokesman said.
   Asked how a person whose identity could not be verified ended up
talking to the president of the United States, Fitzwater said: ``It
(the call) got through because we wanted it to get through.''
   He said Iran has a history of seeking to communicate with the
West in an ``unorthodox manner'' and that ``any communication from
the leadership of Iran has to be treated differently.''
   Fitzwater said the caller first talked to National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft. ``This call came in. It was suspicious,''
he said.
   But the spokesman said Bush was ``willing to make this call (the
second one) on the off-chance that it might be real.''
   Fitzwater initially said that the caller left a number, and that
the White House returned the call using that number. However, he
later was vague on whether the second call was placed or received
by the White House, saying he didn't want to get into such details.
   The episode was first reported Thursday by CBS News.
   Eight Americans, including Terry Anderson, the chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, and 10 other Westerners are
being held hostage in Lebanon. Most of them are being held factions
loyal to Iran.
   The Bush administration contends Rafsanjani's government has
influence with those holding the hostages.
   In the past, officials have said that the United States has had
no direct contact with Iran on the matter, although there has been
considerable activity through non-governmental channels.
   Fitzwater, asked whether the call would have constituted such a
government-to-government contact had it really been Rafsanjani,
allowed that it would have been. So in the future ``we won't talk
about contacts,'' he said.
   The spokesman said just because one prankster got through to
Bush doesn't mean it's open season for hoax calls.
   ``Let me make it clear ... before people start calling the White
House,'' he said. ``All of these kinds of phone calls are checked
out very carefully.''

   Hughes Aircraft Co. admitted Friday that
it unlawfully obtained classified Pentagon budget documents, and
agreed to pay the government $3.67 million, officials said.
   Hughes, which pleaded guilty to two felony counts, is the fourth
major defense contractor to admit to such charges. Three to six
other Pentagon contractors remain under investigation, said Michael
J. Costello, special agent in charge of the Defense Criminal
Investigative Service's Washington field office.
   The two counts against Hughes concern five-year defense program
documents issued in 1983 and 1984 summarizing resources planned,
programmed and budgeted by the Department of Defense, according to
a statement by Susan J. Crawford, the Pentagon's inspector general.
   The documents were classified secret and they were not
releasable to Defense Department contractors, the statement said.
   Hughes, through former employee Frank J. Caso, unlawfully
acquired these and other classified Pentagon documents from
employees of other defense contractors between 1978 and 1985,
according to a statement from U.S. Attorney Henry E. Hudson of the
eastern district of Virginia.
   Caso has not been charged, said Costello, who added that he
could not confirm nor deny whether Caso was the subject of a
criminal investigation.
   The Crawford statement said Hughes tried to hide the fact that
it had the documents. Before 1978, Hughes did not enter the
documents into its classified document accountability system. From
1978 through 1985, the documents ``were logged into the system but
not under their actual titles in an attempt to hide their
receipt,'' the statement said.
   Richard Dore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles-based Hughes, did
not immediately return a phone call seeking comment on the case.
   Hughes agreed to pay $3.55 million in settlement of any civil
liability which may arise out of its actions, plus $50,000 for
investigative costs, $50,000 from its overhead account, and a total
of $20,000 in penalties stemming from the actual charges. Each
charge carries a maximum penalty of $10,000.
   The company will make the payment within five days, according to
the plea agreement entered before U.S. District Judge James C.
Cacheris.
   Costello said he was not certain how much money, if any, Hughes
earned because of its access to the documents.
   ``We would have to make an assumption that they did make
money,'' he said. ``That's the reason for the $3.5 million
settlement.''
   Negotiations with Hughes had been under way for several months,
he said.
   The probe of defense contractors _ begun in the mid-1980s and
code-named Operation Uncover _ has resulted in guilty pleas from
three other major defense contractors as well: GTE Government
Systems Division, The Boeing Company and RCA Corp, Costello said.
The investigation has been carried out by DCIS, the Defense
Department Inspector General's investigative arm.
   GTE paid about $300,000 in fines in 1985, he said.
   The Boeing Company paid fines and restitution of $5.2 million,
and a Boeing employee, Richard Lee Fowler, was convicted last
December of 39 counts of conspiracy, conveyance without authority,
conversion and mail fraud and sentenced to two years in prison, the
Hudson statement said.
   On Feb. 5, RCA Corp. was ordered to pay fines and restitution of
$2.75 million, and former RCA employee Leonard Kampf and current
RCA employee Ronald Stevens each pleaded guilty to one felony count
of conveyance without authority. Each faces up to 10 years in
prison and fines of up to $10,000. Sentencing for the two is
scheduled for April 6, the Hudson statement said.

<HEAD>Indians Regain Land From Jackie Onassis with Ancient Credo: `Stand
Firm'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Wampanoag is pronounced wam-pa-no'-ahg</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GAY HEAD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Wampanoag Indians, who have lived on
these red cliffs for centuries, follow a simple creed that explains
how they regained 400 acres and successfully battled Jacqueline
Onassis in a decade-old land dispute.
   They call it ``Iootash,'' meaning ``stand firm,'' a word that
was relayed to tribal members by the legendary chief Annawon when
the Pilgrims arrived in 1620.
   That philosophy has sustained them over the years, spurring
their fight for valuable acreage here that they say is of
historical significance to the tribe. They also ended the fight
with Mrs. Onassis last week when she agreed to give them a larger
piece of land and $100,000 in exchange for their shares of a tiny
beachfront site on Martha's Vineyard that figures in tribal legend.
   ``We tend to be stubborn,'' said Donald Widdiss, president of
the Wampanoag Tribal Council. ``We tend to think very seriously
about strategy and about what we want.''
   There may be only about 250 Wampanoags on the island just south
of Cape Cod, but the tribe is tenacious. The Wampanoags were eking
out a living on the clay cliffs around 1100 when Leif Erickson
became the first white man to make contact with them.
   Some tribal members fought Mrs. Onassis' attempt to buy them out
of the 1.5 acre site, a tangled web of litigation that began in
1980. Mrs. Onassis owned a one-sixth share of the land, which is
surrounded by her 400-acre estate.
   But 25 Wampanoags, the descendants of William Vanderhoop, an
original owner of the site, were determined to get another piece of
land in exchange. Tribal legend has it that the site is where the
great chief Moshup threw his children into the sea when he foresaw
the coming of the white man.
   ``We didn't want to give up something that had belonged to our
great-great grandfather,'' said Thelma Vanderhoop Weissberg, 62, in
an interview at her home after the settlement was announced
Wednesday in Dukes County Probate Court.
   ``I have a very special feeling about the land here. It's a
feeling only an Indian can have. It was important we get more land
in return, not just money.''
   Charlie Vanderhoop, 68, who was born at the Gay Head lighthouse
when his father was the lighthouse keeper, stood on the cliffs a
few hours after the Onassis settlement and pointed at a stretch of
ocean known as the Devil's Den in Wampanoag lore.
   ``Everything here means something to me,'' said Vanderhoop. ``I
want to keep as much land as we can for our children.''
   The Wampanoags have made their living from the sea for
centuries. Not long ago, it was whaling and swordfishing. Now those
who can afford boats go shellfishing. Many of the women work in
souvenir shops on the picturesque cliffs.
   Just how tough the Wampanoags were was made clear in 1974, when
they filed suit against the town of Gay Head for land they said was
tribal property. They claimed that the 1790 Indian Nonintercourse
Act, forbidding transfer of Indian lands without federal approval,
was violated in the 1870s when the state redistributed tribal lands
to residents.
   They won the land settlement several years ago, just as they
received federal recognition as a tribe. The Wampanoag were given
$4.5 million to buy back land in Gay Head.
   Beatrice Gentry, 79, another member of the Vanderhoop family,
initiated the first lawsuits in the 1970s.
   ``We wanted the land because it's part of our culture,'' said
Gentry, who worked her way through college by making pots from the
cliffs' clay.
   Gay Head, on the southwestern tip of Martha's Vineyard, is one
of the poorest communities in the state, although it's just a few
miles up the beach from the sprawling, shingled summer homes of the
wealthy and the well-known. During the past 100 years, only two
non-Indians have been elected to the town council.
   Many Wampanoag are wary of outsiders and some believe all the
land in Gay Head should be returned to them. They refuse to use the
term ``Pilgrims'' to describe the early white settlers.
   ``They were invaders,'' said Widdiss.

   The State Department said Friday that Syrian
President Hafez Assad, in denouncing democratic change in Eastern
Europe and calling for an endless war against Israel, ``is out of
step with the enormously promising changes unfolding around the
world.''
   Margaret Tutwiler, the department's spokeswoman, said the people
of the Middle East, including the people of Syria, have ``no need
for more bellicose rhetoric.''
   Rather they need ``real statesmanship and commitment to the
practical steps needed to bring about a Palestinian-Arab dialogue
leading to a comprehensive peace settlement,'' she said.
   Assad, addressing a youth rally in Damascus on Thursday, called
for an infinite holy war against Israel and said the changes
sweeping Eastern Europe are a boon to the Jewish state.
   Assad denounced the recent wave of Soviet Jewish emigration to
Israel, saying migrating Jews would force Palestinians from their
homeland.
   ``Let us now perceive that Israel was the first beneficiary,
among all nations of the world, of the international changes that
have taken place,'' Assad said.
   He said the jihad, or holy war against Israel ``should be as
long as time.''
   Ms. Tutwiler said: President Assad's criticism is ``out of step
with the enormously promising changes unfolding around the world as
well as with the serious effort to move toward peace in the Middle
East.''
   ``President Assad ought to be commiting himself to peace, not
war,'' she said.

<HEAD>China Buys More Wheat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has bought an additional 396,300 metric
tons of U.S. wheat under a price subsidy program, the Agriculture
Department said Friday.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said two private exporting companies
made the deals under the department's Export Enhancement Program,
or EEP.
   Delivery of the wheat is scheduled for July and August, he said.
   The sales were part of 1 million tons authorized China under EEP
on Feb. 8. Previous allocations had been exhausted except for 1,050
tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The latest sales would be about 14.5 million bushels. At
current prices estimated by USDA at around $4 per bushel, the wheat
would have a farm value of around $58 million.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in
selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Dickerson said the latest subsidies averaged $4.43 per ton, or
about 12 cents per bushel.
   The subsidized sales were handled by Mitsubishi International
Corp., 30,000 tons; and Continental Grain Co., 366,300 tons.
   With the latest sales, China has bought about 700,000 tons of
U.S. wheat for delivery in the 1990-91 wheat marketing year that
will begin June 1, compared with more than 5.7 million tons in
1989-90.

<HEAD>Rostenkowski Derides Bush and Democratic Tax Cut Proposals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Proposals to cut Social Security and capital
gains taxes are in a tight race for an award for dumbest ideas of
the year, Congress' chief tax-writer said Friday.
   ``I was left nearly speechless by this competition until I
finally decided to simply call both proposals political junk food
and just let them go at that,'' Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.,
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a speech in
Boca Raton, Fla.
   Rostenkowski took jabs at President Bush, who wants to cut taxes
on capital gains, and some senior Democrats, led by Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan of New York, who want to cut Social Security taxes.
   Democratic leaders are weighing how to respond to Moynihan's
proposal, which has particular appeal in an election year. Their
response on that issue will be included in a plan, expected in the
near future, setting out the party's policy on an array of tax
issues.
   Rostenkowski has written a piece to be published in Sunday's
Washington Post in which he spells out his own suggestions on taxes
and deficit reduction. He is expected to rely on one of his
favorite ideas _ a sharp increase in the gasoline tax _ and on
raising taxes on tobacco, alcohol and oil.
   Bush's proposed cut in taxes on capital gains, which are profits
from the sale of investments, is worse than the one the president
recommended last year, Rostenkowski said in the speech.
   ``At a time when the deficit is too big, he suggests cutting
taxes,'' Rostenkowski said. ``At a time when people are concerned
about erosion of the tax system's progressivity, he wants to make
it less progressive,'' meaning it would be based less on the
ability to pay.
   A copy of Rostenkowski's Florida speech was made available in
Washington.
   The congressman ridiculed Moynihan's conclusion that Social
Security taxes should be cut because surplus taxes are being used
to hide the true size of the overall budget deficit. The 1983
reform plan Moynihan helped write was not broken, Rostenkowski
said, but ``he decided to fix it by suggesting that Social Security
taxes be cut.''
   ``If there were an Academy Award for the worst idea of the year,
we'd be watching a very tight race here,'' Rostenkowski said.
   Since he was speaking to a meeting of the Futures Industry
Association, whose members trade in commodities, Rostenkowski added
a third candidate for the dubious award: Bush's proposal to tax
transactions in the futures markets.
   He promised to oppose that proposal vigorously but predicted it
might fare better in the Senate Finance Committee.
   In Washington, meanwhile, Rostenkowski's senior aides told
reporters ``we don't think we have the votes now to beat a capital
gains cut.''
   The aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also released
the latest in a series of reports concluding that cutting capital
gains taxes would continue to shift more of the tax burden away
from upper-income Americans.
   The report is based on Congressional Budget Office analysis of
trends in taxation since 1977. The basic conclusion is that major
tax laws enacted in 1978 and 1981 cut taxes significantly for the
wealthiest Americans but not nearly so much for those who earn less.
   Rostenkowski, in a statement on the new report, said the
reduction in tax burdens for the wealthy was ``staggering.''
   The CBO conclusion is essentially the same as that in a study by
Citizens for Tax Justice that was made public Thursday. That study
found if tax laws were made as fair today as they were in 1977, all
but the richest 10 percent would pay less and the government would
still collect $67.5 billion a year more.
   The Bush administration prefers to point out to figures showing
the richest Americans pay a greater share of the total tax burden
than they were in 1977. Congressional economists agree _ but say
that's because incomes of the wealthiest 10 percent have soared
during the same period.

<HEAD>Rafsanjani Calls Phone Hoax `Disaster' For Bush</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Hostage Hoax, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani said
Friday that the telephone hoax in which President Bush thought he
was talking to Rafsanjani was a ``disaster'' for Washington.
   Speaking in a sermon in Tehran, Rafsanjani marveled at the fact
that Bush could be duped by an impostor.
   ``Can it be that such a global power, with all its intelligence
capabilities, talks to a person it cannot identify?'' he asked.
``This is a strange occurrence.
   ``This shows the United States very much needs to talk to Iran,
but, with God's grace, it is deprived of this blessing,'' he said.
   Standing behind a podium with his hands resting on the barrel of
an AK-47 rifle, Rafsanjani said:
   ``Iran's stature in the world is so high that the strongest
power in the world, and the greatest power on Earth is grappling to
find an opening to your executive leader even through telephone
wires.''
   He said Iran expected the United States to answer such questions
as ``who was the intermediary, who did they talk to and what did
they talk about.''
   ``Now we must wait for explanations and witness another Irangate
in the making, God willing,'' Rafsanjani said, referring to the
Reagan administration's ill-fated attempt to sell weapons to Iran
in return for the release of the U.S. hostages in Lebanon, and then
giving the money to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in Washington on
Thursday that Bush returned a phone call last month to a man he
thought was the Iranian president, but it turned out to be a hoax.
   Fitzwater did not give details of the conversation or say how it
was discovered the call was a hoax. CBS News said the two men spoke
about the release of the U.S. hostages.
   Rafsanjani said the incident provided a glimpse of the
``confusion of leaders inside the White House.''
   ``There is a new disaster in Washington, which I think is a
wonder,'' he said in the hour-long sermon, which was broadcast on
Tehran Television and monitored in Nicosia.
   The Bush administration has said it believes that Rafsanjani's
government has influence with the captors of the eight Americans
and 10 other Western captives held in Lebanon.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16,
1985.
   The disclosure of the hoax came amid a flurry of recent reports
indicating movement on the hostage issue. However, U.S. officials
have said they are unable to cite any progress toward freeing the
hostages.
   Fitzwater said that although Bush was tricked once, he would do
the same thing again if he thought it would help win the release of
the hostages.
   ``If a call came through at some future point that we believed
was real, he would take it,'' Fitzwater said. ``The president has
made it known he's willing to talk to Iran at any time. And the
ball is in their court.''
   In a related develoment, a previously unknown group threatened
to kill one of two Swiss hostages in Lebanon unless two Lebanese
jailed in France and Switzerland are freed.
   The threat by the Action Group for the Release of (Mohammed)
Hariri was made by an anonymous phone caller to a Western news
agency in Nicosia.
   Mohammed Hariri was jailed for life in Switzerland in February
1989 for hijacking an Air Afrique jetliner in 1987 and killing a
French passenger after the aircraft landed in Geneva.

<HEAD>Administration Faulty On Delay for Lab Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Congress scolded the Bush
administration Friday for failing to meet the deadline for setting
out regulations to assure the quality and accuracy of all medical
laboratory tests.
   Lawmakers were not appeased by the Health Care Financing
Administration's announcement that final rules to bring 12,000
medical labs under uniform national testing standards would be
published next week and could go into effect after a 60-day comment
period.
   By HCFA's own estimate, there are between 300,000 and 600,000
medical testing facilities _ including labs in physicians' offices,
employer health units, public health departments, blood banks and
public screening labs. Most of those would be covered by other
rules HCFA is drafting, but has not yet formally proposed.
   ``It is critical that all laboratories be regulated,'' said Sen.
Brock Adams, D-Wash. ``Each month the implementation ... is
delayed, more cases of cancer go undetected, more men and women
receive erroneous laboratory reports and more tragedies result.''
   ``We need a sense of urgency,'' added Sen. Barbara Mikulski,
D-Md., at the joint hearing of the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee and the Governmental Affairs subcommittee on oversight of
government management.
   Gail Wilensky, who recently took over as head of HCFA, told the
lawmakers the rules covering 12,000 labs that receive payments from
Medicare and Medicaid ``will make a tremendous difference'' in the
way those labs operate.
   She said those rules were already being drafted when Congress
passed a law in 1988 giving HCFA authority to regulate all testing
labs and directing the agency to have rules in place to implement
the law by Jan. 1, 1990.
   The main reason for the delay in meeting that deadline, she
said, was ``major unexpected dissension within the scientific
community'' over which tests should be subject to the least
regulation because of their simplicity and low risk to the patient,
and which ones should meet tougher standards.
   She said HCFA expected to propose rules to meet the 1988 law in
three stages. The first set of rules, which she expected to be
proposed by mid-April, would define three levels of testing and the
personnel, quality assurance and proficiency testing requirements
for each level.
   Pressed by lawmakers to estimate when the law would be fully
implemented, Wilensky said it would depend on how many comments the
agency receives on the proposals but that she hoped it would be
within two years.
   Lawmakers have been particularly concerned about Pap tests used
to detect cervical cancer. Reports about inaccuracies in these
tests helped spur passage of the 1988 law. Rep. Carl Levin,
D-Mich., estimated that up to 40 percent of Pap test results are
done incorrectly.
   Wilensky said 75 percent of Pap tests are performed by the
12,000 labs that will soon be regulated, but Leven said that will
still leave as many as 20 million Pap tests each year being read by
unregulated labs.
   ``That's still a huge number waiting for some kind of
assurance,'' Levin said.
   Under the regulations HCFA expects to propose next month, some
tests would be waived from regulation because they are simple, low
risk and have little margin for error. Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who
testified at the hearing, said he was concerned that tests for
strep throat, sickle cell anemia, blood clotting and gonorrhea
would be exempt.
   Cholesterol screening would be subject to a higher level of
oversight and regulation because the test is more complex and
involves a greater degree of risk to the patient if performed
incorrectly, Wilensky said.
   The highest level of regulation would be imposed for tests such
as the Pap smear and for AIDS infection, she said.

<HEAD>Hungary, Soviet Reach Agreement on Total Withdrawal of Red Army</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary and the Soviet Union have
agreed on a timetable for the total withdrawal of Red Army troops
from Hungarian territory, state radio reported Friday.
   According to the broadcast, the heads of delegations negotiating
the terms of a withdrawal initialed a final agreement in Moscow
Friday.
   Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn is due to travel to Moscow
on Saturday, when he is to sign the agreement with his Soviet
counterpart, Eduard Shevardnadze.
   The pullout is scheduled to begin Monday, the radio said.
   Hungarian Premier Miklos Nemeth said Tuesday that agreement on
the withdrawals was being held up by a difference of only a few
months on the schedule for the pullout.
   But Ferenc Somogyi, secretary of state in the Hungarian Foreign
Ministry and the head of delegation to the negotiations, was quoted
by the Hungarian state news agency MTI as saying in Moscow that the
Soviet side agreed to the proposed deadline for the completion of
the pullout favored by Hungary.
   The total withdrawal is to be completed by June 30, 1991, MTI
reported. The Soviets were reported to have preferred setting the
final pullout date for Aug. 31 of next year.
   Nemeth had said the Soviets wanted the extra two months for
dismantling of military stockpiles.
   Somogyi said that under the terms agreed between the two
delegations, no Soviet soldiers or equipment would remain in his
country after June 30, 1991, MTI reported.
   The text of the agreement was initialed by Somogyi and the head
of the Soviet delegation, Deputy Foreign Minister Ivan Aboimov, MTI
said.
   There are 49,700 Soviet soldiers in Hungary, according to
Hungarian Deputy Chief of Staff Jozsef Biro. Moscow also has 27,146
combat vehicles, including 860 tanks, 600 artillery pieces and
1,500 armored personnel carriers, stationed on Hungarian territory,
Biro disclosed last week.
   Biro said 2,029 military transport trains would be required to
transport the troops, non-military personnel and their families and
the equipment back to the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet pullout from Czechoslovakia began last month, with
the last of 73,500 Red Army troops there scheduled to depart next
year.

three weeks before the national head count gets into gear.
   The transfer of James Gorman came after a news story about
confusion over how the Commerce Department would observe the moment
the nation's population reached 250 million, according to Census
employees who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity.
   Gorman was quoted by The New York Times as saying ``we couldn't
get it together,'' when asked about confusion over staging the
event last week.
   Gorman declined to comment on his transfer to a new post as a
senior adviser to the deputy director of the bureau.
   Officials of the Commerce Department, parent agency for the
Census Bureau, were not immediately available.
   The bureau calculates the nation inceases by one person every 14
seconds, and thus estimated that the quarter-billion population
figure was reached March 6. A news release was issued and a photo
opportunity scheduled involving Commerce Department officials.
   But that was later rescheduled from March 6 to March 8 and the
site moved from the bureau office in Suitland, Md., to the Commerce
Department in downtown Washington.
   Eventually, the event was dropped altogether.
   Gorman's comment to the newspaper apparently provoked his
transfer, Census employees said, from the public relations post in
which he had supervised planning for the current national head
count over the last several years.
   Gorman's post is being filled by an assistant on an acting basis.

   Mayor Marion Barry plans to return to the
nation's capital from substance abuse treatment in South Carolina
on Saturday to talk about the possibility of running for
re-election, city government sources said Friday.
   After a month of treatment at a separate location in Florida,
Barry began a 30-day treatment program at Fenwick Hall Hospital
outside Charleston two weeks ago.
   Last weekend, the District of Columbia's non-voting delegate in
Congress, Walter Fauntroy, said he would run in November for the
mayor's post now held by Barry, who faces an eight-count federal
indictment on drug and perjury charges.
   ``He's very upset about Fauntroy entering the mayor's race, and
he's been hurt by the defections of his top advisers,'' said one
source familiar with Barry's thinking. ``He plans to talk to these
people, and also meet with his people on the ward level to see if
he can run again.''
   The sources commented on condition of anonymity.
   Anita Bonds, Barry's campaign manager, acknowledged that Barry
was ``disappointed'' by Fauntroy's decision and upset with former
supporters who have jumped to Fauntroy's side.
   ``At this point, he has very little feeling for them,'' Bonds
said. ``You will remember, on the weekend following his arrest, a
lot of those same people now backing Fauntroy were trying to get
Jesse Jackson to run.''
   Jackson has since declined to run.
   Barry was indicted last month on three perjury charges and five
misdemeanor counts of cocaine possession. He was arrested Jan. 18
at a downtown hotel by federal agents who said he was smoking crack
cocaine.
   He had told aides privately during the weekend following his
arrest that he had abandoned all hopes of running for a fourth
four-year term, but he delayed making any public announcement of
his plans. Aides have since predicted the mayor would be reluctant
to stay out of the race.
   ``He's got to have some time to get the lay of the land,'' Bonds
said. ``I don't believe he will have crystallized his plans in a
day or two or anything like that.''

<HEAD>Thatcher Blames Leftists for Tax Revolt Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANNE McGOWAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Friday blamed
leftist militants for violent protests of a new tax that has
sparked a popular revolt, and the opposition leader said the
demonstrators were playing into the government's hands.
   Authorities in the east London borough of Hackney were cleaning
up after Thursday night's rampage by opponents of the tax, called
the community charge by the Conservative government but popularly
known as the poll tax.
   The revolt is presenting Mrs. Thatcher with a serious political
setback, and rumors circulated Friday that she would resign or be
fired as Conservative leader.
   ``We are not at the peak of our popularity,'' said Sir Geoffrey
Howe, deputy prime minister, in a radio interview. But he added,
``We have to keep our nerve.''
   The crisis also is dividing the opposition Labor Party. Some
Laborites are urging a campaign of civil disobedience against the
tax, but leader Neil Kinnock said all opposition must be within the
law.
   Mrs. Thatcher blamed a leftist group known as Militant Tendency
for the violence that left Hackney's main street strewn with glass,
and police have said the disturbances were caused by people from
outside the boroughs.
   ``As you know, it is not the way to conduct affairs at all,''
the prime minister said in Glasgow, Scotland ``Any conduct
intimidating or violent is absolutely contradictory to democracy.''
   Police arrested about 60 people, nine of whom appeared in court
Friday on charges including assault and criminal damage. They said
20 of those arrested gave addresses outside the borough.
   About 30 police officers were injured, and the extent of the
damage was being assessed, police said.
   The community charge replaces the system of taxing homeowners to
pay for government services. Instead, municipal councils will now
divide the costs of services equally among all adults in their
districts.
   Charges vary widely, depending on the level of services provided
by a district. And since each adult is taxed, it means two people
living in a two-room apartment would pay twice as much as one
person living next door in an eight-room house.
   Local legislators in the borough of Haringey met Friday to
discuss their district's tax, which at $974 is one of the highest
in the country. During a meeting of the council Monday night,
demonstrations outside turned violent, and police had to clear
shouting protesters from the spectator section.
   On Friday, about 50 people peacefully protested outside.
   Both Mrs. Thatcher and Kinnock were in Scotland, which has had
its own poll tax for the past year and an estimated half a million
people are being prosecuted for failure to pay.
   Kinnock told the Scottish Labor Party's conference that a Labor
government would abolish the poll tax, which he dubbed ``Maggie's
tax,'' and replace it with a tax based on property and the ability
to pay. But he urged that opposition to it stay within the law.
   ``We who seek, through democracy, the power to rule by law,
cannot pick and choose which laws we obey,'' Kinnock said. He said
the demonstrators were helping the Conservatives' cause by using
violence to protest.
   But fellow Laborite Tony Benn said he would not pay the tax,
which he called unjust.
   Mrs. Thatcher tried to dismiss rumors of worries within her
government that the poll tax would make the Conservatives lose the
next election.
   ``I find no nervousness in the Cabinet at all,'' she told the
BBC.
   The new tax takes effect April 1 in England and Wales, when
local districts must submit to the federal government their annual
charges.
   Disabled people and those with low incomes can receive rebates
of up to 80 percent. But critics say that apart from this, the new
tax is unfair because it takes no account of an individual's
ability to pay.
   In latest opinion polls, the Conservatives trail Labor by as
much as 19 points.

   U.S. Applauds Aoun's Call for Ceasefire in Lebanon
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said Friday it is
encouraged by the decision of Gen. Michael Aoun to abandon Lebanese
warfare for dialogue, and called on him to submit to the authority
of the country's government.
   ``We hope that Gen. Aoun is serious about abandoning violence;
the Lebanese people have suffered enough,'' said Margaret Tutwiler,
the department's spokeswoman.
   Aoun called Friday for a ceasefire after a month of bloody
fighting and said he was ready for peace negotiations with a rival
Christian leader and with leaders of Lebanon's Moslem majority.
   Aoun also dropped his rejection of the so-called Taif accord, an
Arab League plan aimed at settling the 15-year civil war.
   ``The general should now finally submit to the authority of his
country's legitimate government,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   She said the United Sttes is encouraged that Aoun ``may be
interested in resolving his diferences through dialogue.''
   ``We urge all Lebanese, particularly those elements of the
Lebanese army who were misled into using violence, to support (the
Lebanese government) and the process of peaceful reconciliation,''
she said and added:
   ``We continue to belive that the Taif accords represent the best
course for settling Lebanon's problems.''

<HEAD>Lights Return, Des Moines Stacks Branches</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tree limbs were stacked head high along
curbs in many Des Moines neighborhoods Friday as the metropolitan
area cleaned up from what the state climatologist said may have
been the ice storm of the century.
   Two days after central Iowa was glazed with thick ice,
temperatures were in the 60s and rivers were rising.
   The storm stuck at least an inch of ice on tree limbs and power
lines Wednesday, cutting electrical service to 91,000 customers _
more than half of the metropolitan area. Iowa Power spokesman Chuck
Seel said the company hoped the remaining customers would be hooked
up by Sunday.
   The utility had restored power to all but about 14,000 customers
by Friday morning.
   ``We're tickled to death at how well it's gone,'' Seel said.
   ``A lot of those who are without service have the toughest
repairs,'' he said, such as service lines ripped out of houses by
falling limbs.
   Hundreds of linemen and their boom trucks were brought in from
other cities and nearly all were working double shifts.
   ``There are at least 330 linemen or tree men out there, and 150
worked through the night,'' Seel said.
   State climatologist Harry Hillaker said other ice storms have
caused damage but none were as severe.
   ``I've checked other storms that were called the worst of this
century, and this one was more widespread,'' he said.
   Rivers were swollen with runoff Friday as the ice melted but no
flooding was reported.
   The storm also iced sections of states north and west of Iowa.
Two days earlier it dumped as much as 50 inches of snow on Colorado
and Wyoming. Major highways in southeastern Wyoming weren't
reopened until late Thursday.
   Des Moines and its suburbs urged homeowners to haul tree limbs
broken by the weight of the ice out to the curb, where they would
be hauled away within several weeks. Huge stacks of twisted
branches began to appear Thursday, sometimes spilling on to street
or sidewalks.
   One woman said the experience was enough to make Californians
thankful that all they have to worry about are earthquakes.
   ``People are always telling me that they wouldn't live in
California because they don't want to be in an earthquake. What I
went through here, trees crashing and everything, was as bad as
going through an earthquake,'' said Mary Marie Scatterlee of San
Jose, Calif., who was visiting Des Moines when the storm hit.
   Although falling trees hit practically everything and traffic
lights did not work, no serious injuries or deaths were attributed
to the storm.
   Melted ice cream drooled out of freezers and meat spoiled as
many residents and businesses saw their third day without
electricity.
   Businesses without power simply shut down, as did Des Moines
schools and Drake University for a second day Friday, but some
improvised to serve their customers.
   Tait's Super Valu, a grocery store, opened for five hours
Thursday after an employee donated a generator to run lights and
coolers.
   But there wasn't enough power to run the checkout computers and
price scanners. Customers were asked to remember what things cost
and checkers punched adding machines.
   ``It's hard to tell how much we lost, but people who shop at
grocery stores are generally honest,'' said grocery manager Tim
Harrington.
   ``It worked pretty well. And people weren't buying large
quantities of things, since they didn't have refrigeration at home,
either,'' he said.
   Des Moines Cold Storage Co. Inc., housing 20 million pounds of
perishable goods, was able to save most of its stock.
   ``It's perishables of all descriptions,'' said President Chuck
Muelhaupt. ``That's meat, ice cream, vegetables. We were scared to
death. If it hadn't come on, you would have seen the biggest mass
of melted ice cream. You would have had the world's largest garbage
dump.''

<HEAD>JANA Appeals to Arab News Agencies to Fight `Campaign of Lies'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The official Libyan news agency appealed to Arab
news agencies on Friday to combat a U.S. ``campaign of lies''
regarding a plant outside Tripoli that Washington says produces
chemical weapons.
   ``The Rabta plant in Great Jamahiriya (Libya) is a plant for the
production of medicines and medical equipment,'' the general
secretary of the news agency, JANA, was quoted as saying.
   His comments were in a telex sent to directors of the Federation
of Arab News Agencies and the agencies of the Arab Maghreb Union
and the Arab News Federation.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater alleged this week that
the plant 60 miles south of Tripoli was producing poison gas. Other
U.S. officials said the plant was making limited amounts of mustard
gas and nerve agents.
   West German Foreign Ministry spokesman Hanns Schumacher said
Friday there are ``vague indications about a possible production of
a limited amount of about 30 tons of mustard gas'' at the plant.
   The information came from West German intelligence early this
year, and U.S. officials were immediately informed about the
report, the spokesman said.
   Relations between Bonn and Washington were strained early last
year after U.S. officials accused West German companies of helping
Libya build the plant.
   The West German government first denied the allegations but
later launched its own probe which is still pending.
   ``The U.S. administration ... leads a campaign of lies and false
accusations from which it aims to mislead the world public opinion
claiming that this cultural medical plant is a plant for chemical
weapons,'' said the JANA director, who was not identified.
   JANA said its director called on the Arab agencies to join in
``Arab solidarity in the face of the biased informational media
campaign and to foil the whole U.S. aggressive scheme.''
   U.S. officials have said they want the Rabta plant dismantled.
West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher has called for
international inspections to be carried out at Rabta.
   Libya has repeatedly denied the Rabta plant is designed to
produce chemical weapons or that it has begun manufacturing poison
gas.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Allows Pentagon to Shift Funds, But House Balks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Armed Services Committee has voted
to grant the Pentagon part of the authority to transfer money to
military personnel accounts and avert massive layoffs, the panel's
chairman said Friday.
   But the action should have little overall effect on the
department's request since Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the
House Armed Services Committee, has refused to take up the issue in
his panel.
   Such shifting of funds must be approved by the House and Senate
armed services panels and the House and Senate appropriations
committees.
   The Defense Department originally asked Congress for the
authority to transfer $935 million from weapons and other accounts
to personnel to avoid laying off tens of thousands of men and
women, freezing promotions and holding up transfers.
   The drastic steps are required under the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law.
   But Aspin said President Bush could have exempted personnel from
the law back on Aug. 15, as past administrations have done, and
declined to take up the Pentagon's request.
   ``Putting weapons before people was their decision and now
they're stuck with it,'' Aspin said late last month.
   Nevertheless, the Senate committee voted in executive session
Thursday to approve 85 percent of the Pentagon's request, or $795
million from weapons to personnel accounts.
   The action would force the Defense Department to take some
voluntary steps, including reducing the number of new recruits
during the rest of fiscal 1990 and allowing some people to leave 90
days before their service ends.
   The department would be spared involuntary, adverse personnel
actions.
   ``We voted on the side of the men and women in the military who
were put at risk by the administration's decision not to use its
authority to exempt the military personnel accounts,'' Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., the Armed Services chairman, said in a speech on the
Senate floor Friday.
   In a related development, Aspin said Friday significant cuts in
defense spending are possible over the next several years, but
initial cuts will have to be small.
   A ``concerted and strategic effort is needed to restructure our
armed forces consistent with the imperative to buy the right
combination of forces, equipment, operational readiness and
research in this time of great change and uncertainity,'' he said.
   In a letter to the Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the
House Budget Committee, Aspin declined to reveal his overall figure
for the fiscal 1991 defense budget.
   The Bush administration has proposed a budget of $306.7 billion,
including funds for defense, the Department of Energy and military
construction.
   In a Republican response to Aspin's letter, Rep. William
Dickinson, R-Ala., expressed his support for the administration's
budget and warned against deep cuts in defense spending.
   ``Although most of us feel more secure when assessing Soviet
military intentions, Soviet military capability, even after the
pending CFE and START agreements are concluded, remains
formidable,'' said Dickinson, the panel's ranking GOP member.
   Nunn, in a letter to the Senate Budget Committee, said he
couldn't provide an overall figure for the fiscal 1991 defense
budget because the Pentagon hasn't produced a comprehensive
five-year defense plan.
   In addition, Nunn noted the Pentagon is currently reviewing
several big-ticket programs such as the B-2 stealth bomber, the
C-17 transport plane and the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   ``In order for the Armed Services Committee and the whole
Congress to make decisions on the fiscal 1991 defense budget, we
must have a clear picture of where our defense policies are going
over the next three to five years,'' Nunn said in a three-page
letter.

<HEAD>Moscow Embassy Official Discloses Wider Dissemination For Terror
Warning</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow
testified Friday that a terrorist warning prior to the December
1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 was widely distributed to
Americans in Moscow and given to Soviet officials.
   The State Department previously acknowledged only that the
notice was improperly posted in the embassy a week before Flight
103 blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
   Officials said the posting violated a policy against notifying
government workers when other prospective passengers are not told
of a threat.
   Raymond F. Smith, who was acting deputy chief of mission in
Moscow at the time, told the Presidential Commission on Aviation
Security and Terrorism that he felt a ``moral obligation to let
people know'' about the threat against Pan Am flights between
Frankfurt and the United States.
   Smith said, in sworn testimony, that he knew of no other embassy
that disseminated the notice publicly. State Department officials
have said the threat turned out to be a hoax orginating in
Helsinki, Finland, despite the fact it fit the Lockerbie bombing.
   Smith said embassy officials decided in a top-level staff
meeting to give the notice the widest distribution possible,
posting it at several strategic places around the compound and
sending it to a company that contracted work?z????

<TEXT>
   to the Soviet government.
   The official, who is now Moscow embassy political counsellor,
said he also notified the Federal Aviation Administration, which
had originated the advisory, that the notice was being posted, and
received no response.
   The embassy notice said employees were left to their own
discretion on whether to change travel plans but noted they still
were required to fly on an American carrier. Pan Am was the only
U.S. carrier flying out of Moscow, although other airlines could be
used from Europe to the United States.
   Also at the hearing, the commission disclosed a Telex from Pan
Am's Moscow office saying that 80 percent of Moscow passengers were
changing their bookings as a result of the posted threat.
   But the official who sent the internal Telex, the airline's
former Moscow manager Jennifer S. Young, testified that she had no
direct knowledge of any cancelations and used the 80-percent figure
to give her missive more impact.
   Ms. Young said a part-time reservations clerk at Pan Am's office
in the embassy had told her there were several inquiries about the
notice and she got the impression there also were cancelations.
   Commission Chairwoman Ann McLaughlin said the panel staff has
yet to find hard evidence of any changes in bookings as a result of
the threat but has asked Pan Am for passenger data and is
continuing its investigation.
   Relatives of some of the U.S. victims of the Dec. 21, 1988,
bombing have questioned why the plane had more than 160 empty seats
on a flight during a busy holiday period and say they believe
government workers canceled because of the selective warning.
   Family members of victims filled the first three rows at the
hearing, which is the commission's fourth since it began its work
last September.
   Mrs. McLaughlin, former labor secretary, said the commission has
conducted 150 interviews in the United States, England, Germany,
France, the Soviet Union and Turkey and has accumulated thousands
of pages of testimony.
   The panel, which has a $1 million budget, has until May 15 to
complete a report to President Bush that will recommend government
actions to combat aviation terrorism. In addition to former Labor
Secretary Mclaughlin, members include Sens. Alfonse D'Amato,
R-N.Y., and Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., Reps. James Oberstar,
D-Minnesota, and John Hammerschmidt, R-Ark., retired Air Force Gen.
Thomas C. Richards and lawyer Edward Hidalgo.

<DATELINE>HAR ADAR, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many Israelis are lured to
the West Bank by cheap land, low or interest-free mortgages and the
desire for the space they lack in most of the country's crowded
cities.
   Such benefits have played a significant role in attracting
75,000 Jews to 143 settlements in the past two decades. They are
also a selling point in efforts by settlement leaders to attract
Soviet Jews who are flooding into Israel.
   A new controversy erupted over the settlements following Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's suggestion _ which he quickly withdrew _
that Israel might need the land captured in the 1967 Middle East
War for settling tens of thousands of new Soviet immigrants.
   His remark set off Arab fears of Israel annexing the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip and prompted U.S. warnings that Israel
would not receive $400 million in requested housing guarantees if
it settled Soviet Jews on occupied land.
   Shamir stressed there was no policy of settling Soviet Jews in
occupied areas, and ``there are no special incentives'' beyond
those given to development towns in remote areas of Israel where
tax breaks are provided to encourage growth and industry.
   Israel Harel, editor of the settler magazine Nekuda, said a
drive to bring Soviet immigrants to the territories has been
``without much success.''
   He said that only about 200 have been placed in the West Bank
and even they had not made a final decision to live there.
   The reasons varied. ``Most of the settlements are religious, and
the immigrants are secular. They like to go to cities, not small
villages like ours. The intefadeh (uprising) doesn't help the
cause, either,'' he said.
   Meron Benvenisti, an ex-deputy mayor of Jerusalem who has
studied the territories for a decade, said even without new
enticements existing benefits for any West Bank settler were
considerable.
   He estimated the government and the World Zionist Organization
have spent $2.5 billion in the past 20 years building and
maintaining the settlements.
   The government has paid for roads, lighting and other site
preparations. It also allocates more money per pupil to educate
settlement children and covers the cost of their busing, Benvenisti
said.
   Settlers enjoy a 7 percent reduction in income taxes and
industries opening in the territories receive a 40 percent grant
for the purchase of equipment, he said.
   Also, Benvenisti said, the Israel Lands Authority sells settlers
building plots from land expropriated from Arabs for 5 percent of
the assessed value. About 40 percent of the West Bank was taken
over by the state under a 1980 decree that expropriated all
unregistered and uncultivated land.
   Settlement leaders are eager to recruit and have mounted a
campaign to attract both Soviet immigrants and native-born Israelis.
   Color glossy brochures promise day-care centers, ``clear
mountain air'' and ``activities for all ages.''
   A flyer from Beit Abba, near Tel Aviv, pictures a spacious
swimming pool. One from Beit Aryeh advertises a community ``for
people with initiative and creativity ... in the center of the
country,'' although it is not in Israel but in the West Bank.
   And in the West Bank settlement of Ariel, where 8,000 people
live about 25 miles north of Jerusalem, a program has been set up
to help Soviet immigrants.
   It provides temporary housing free of charge and arranges for a
family to adopt newcomers to help get them through government red
tape. Language classes and assistance in finding jobs and permanent
housing are also available.
   ``We make them feel very wanted,'' said Dina Shalit, a mayoral
assistant for immigration affairs.
   She said Soviet immigrants interested in settling in Ariel
usually have family or friends among the 150 Russian families who
were among the original founders in the 1970s. In the past six
months, about 55 Soviet Jewish families have come to Ariel.
   But not all the efforts are successful, one reason being that
the Palestinian uprising means most settlers carry arms and have to
be alert constantly for attackers with stones and firebombs.
   Leaders of the Gush Katif block of settlements in the Gaza Strip
recently organized a tour for Soviet newcomers, but spokesman
Menachem Beit Halachmi conceded there have been no takers so far.
   But the settlements have succeeded in attracting Israelis,
mostly ardent nationalists who believe living on the war-won land
will help in making it a permanent part of Israel.
   The settlements have grown by 15 percent in the past two years
despite the uprising in which more than 600 Palestinians and 43
Israelis have died.
   ``Most of the people who come to us are coming for ideological
reasons despite the intefadeh,'' Harel said.
   But a main attraction for many, especially in the Jerusalem and
Tel Aviv areas, is a better standard of living than can be found in
cramped city apartments.
   In the hilltop settlement of Har Adar, six miles northwest of
Jerusalem, 240 families have built luxurious carved stone villas
for the price of a three-bedroom apartment in Jerusalem.
   ``We moved out here because we wanted to live in a house and we
couldn't afford it in the city ... and here we are only 20 minutes
from downtown,'' said Debbie Zuberi, 33, who emigrated from San
Francisco 12 years ago and lives in a three-story home with a view
of Jerusalem.
   Shalit of Ariel explained the trend: ``It's like the one-time
American push to the suburbs. People are looking for cleaner air,
less traffic, bigger homes and better schools,'' she said.

   Tugboats on Friday rounded up as many as 14
runaway grain barges that had broken loose during a collision.
   A 20-mile stretch of the Mississippi River was kept closed,
hwoever, to enable the Coast Guard to determine whether three
sunken barges endangered navigation.
   ``I'm told it looks like a river rodeo with tugs chasing barges
all over the place,'' Petty Officer Bob Morehead said before
private tugboats rounded up the barges in three hours.
   There were no reports of injuries.
   The barges got loose after a freighter heading upriver at 6:30
a.m., collided with an oncoming tugboat, the Coral Dawn, which was
towing as many as 30 barges carrying grain.
   Three barges sank after the collision, Morehead said. The
freighter, the Nancy Lykes, did not appear to be leaking, he said.
   Coast Guard Chief Joe Gibson said the river would probably
reopen later Friday. Investigators must first determine that the
sunken barges are not a danger to other vessels, he said.
   The collision occurred near White Castle, about 20 miles south
of Baton Rouge. Coast Guard Capt. William Loesfstedt, captain of
the port for the New Orleans-Baton Rouge area, ordered the river
closed from mile marker 180 to mile marker 200.

<HEAD>19 Killed in Factional Fighting, Whites Blame Gov't Concessions</HEAD>

   Police said Friday that 19
blacks were killed in factional fighting near Johannesburg, and
right-wing whites blamed government concessions to blacks for the
upsurge in violence nationwide.
   ``This country is burning literally and figuratively ... and you
are responsible for it,'' Moolman Mentz of the pro-apartheid
Conservative Party told President F.W. de Klerk at a Parliamentary
debate in Cape Town.
   De Klerk legalized more than 60 opposition groups Feb. 2 to help
clear the way for negotiations on ending white-minority rule and
sharing political power with the black majority.
   In the past month, violence in black townships and tribal
homelands has left 200 people dead in some of the worst fighting
since the nationwide black unrest of 1984-86.
   Mentz, whose party is the official opposition in the white
chamber of Parliament, said the reforms had emboldened black
nationalist groups to try to seize power.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok told Parliament the
government was determined to end unrest and was prepared to use its
extensive powers under the 3{-year-old state of emergency to quell
the violence.
   The worst fighting was in Kathlehong, about 12 miles east of
Johannesburg, where five people were killed overnight and 14 more
bodies were found during the day Friday, police said.
   The fighting began several days ago between rival black taxi
groups over control of routes and other local problems not directly
related to politics.
   The dispute has escalated and groups of black youths have been
waging running battles against each other, according to police and
witnesses.
   Houses have been attacked with fire bombs, vehicles have been
stoned and set on fire and there has been sporadic gunfire. Most of
the dead were stabbed or hacked to death, police said.
   Also, police said they detained 53 blacks without charges in the
central Orange Free State Province. Police said the blacks were
picked up during an overnight sweep through the townships, but
declined to elaborate.
   Police said they arrested 67 whites armed with whips and other
weapons who tried to disrupt a legal march by black teachers in the
central town of Welkom.
   The South African government charged Thursday that some
anti-apartheid groups arebehind the outbreak of violence in tribal
homelands because they are not ready to participate in negotiations
with the white government.
   But ANC leader Walter Sisulu said Friday the government was
reverting ``to the old approach of looking for scapegoats and
hidden instigators.''
   ``The primary reason for the unrest, conflict and confrontation
has always been the poverty and violence caused by apartheid,''
Sisulu said.
   Benny Alexander, leader of the Pan Africanist Congress, a rival
black guerrilla group, said his organization would neither confirm
nor deny that it was behind the recent violence.
   Meanwhile, residents in the nominally independent black homeland
of Bophuthatswana said Friday that scattered clashes with security
forces were continuing.
   Seven people were killed and up to 500 hurt in Bophuthatswana
earlier this week after police fired on protesters demanding the
resignation of the homeland's authoritarian government and the
territory's reintegration into South Africa.
   The authoritarian president of the Ciskei homeland was ousted
Sunday in a coup by its own military.
   Four of South Africa's 10 black homelands are considered
independent by the Pretoria government, but none is recognized
abroad.
   South Africa established the homelands in the 1960s in an
attempt to create separate, tribal-based states for blacks, while
whites would retain control of national politics and the economy.
About 14 million of the country's 28 million blacks live in the
territories.

   Orange harvest prospects continue to improve
but production is still down sharply from last season because of
widespread freeze damage in late December, the Agriculture
Department said Friday.
   The new estimate of 172 million boxes was based on March 1
indications and is up 2 percent from the February forecast of less
than 169 million boxes.
   But the freeze-damaged crop is expected to be down 18 percent
from 209 million boxes in 1988-89. Most of the reduction was
attributed to a 30 percent decline in the Florida crop.
   Florida's orange harvest was estimated at 103 million boxes,
down from 146.6 million last season but up from 100 million
forecast last month.
   The Texas crop was indicated at 1.2 million boxes, down from
1.85 million in 1988-89 but unchanged from the February forecast.
California production, estimated at 66 million boxes, is up from
58.8 million last season but unchanged from last month.
   Arizona production, indicated at 1.7 million boxes, was carried
forward from the earlier forecast and is the same as last season.
   Total grapefruit production was forecast at 41.6 million boxes,
unchanged from February but 36 percent below last year, reflecting
the freeze in Florida and Texas.

   President Najib had just finished
lunch when a series of bombs exploded several yards from where he
was sitting, signaling the start of a coup attempt that almost
toppled his government.
   Explosions rocked the Presidential Palace shortly after 1 p.m.
Tuesday, killing four soldiers from the elite presidential guard.
One cluster of three small bombs gouged out two craters and gutted
an adminstrative office 12 feet from where Najib was working.
   The force of the blast cracked the walls of Najib's office, said
Lt. Col. Mohammad Hussan, who was on duty at the time. Windows
shattered around the president but he apparently emerged unscathed.
   Interviews Friday with government officials and witnesses, both
soldiers and civilians, painted a vivid picture of the bloody
attempt to topple Najib's Soviet-installed government.
   The attempt was the eighth since Najib became president in 1988.
Despite its failure, the coup is expected to damage Najib, who also
faces continued pressure from U.S.-backed anti-Communist guerrillas.
   Tension had been mounting before the bombing began. On Tuesday
morning, Najib talked to Defense Minister Shah Nawaz Tanai and
urged him not to attempt the coup, Najib told a news conference
Thursday.
   The main disagreement, according to government officials, was
that Tanai opposed the arrests of 127 people who were being placed
on trial for an alleged coup attempt in December.
   Government spokesman Naqib Sameer said Tanai opposed the trial
because it would reveal his links to the plot. But Tanai supporters
said the defense minister was worried about driving another wedge
between the already faction-ridden ruling party, the People's
Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
   On Monday, the trial started. The next day Najib called his
defense minister and suggested negotiations. Tanai refused.
   The rebel bombing began shortly after 12:30 p.m. as the city
settled down to lunch. The first bombs hit the city center, near
two empty high schools closed due to lack of funds for education
and fuel to heat the school.
   As many as five jets at a time sped over the capital.
   One dropped a 500-pound bomb in the old city near the serpentine
streets of the grain bazaar.
   ``I was sitting here fixing watches when the houses across the
street just collapsed,'' said Haji Mallem, a watch-mender who works
on the main old city thoroughfare. ``Everybody started screaming
and running. Glass flew everywhere. I saw about 15 people blown
apart.''
   ``Whoever did it wasn't a good Moslem,'' one man shouted from a
crowd that had gathered around Mallen to help tell the story.
   More bombs fell throughout the afternoon. From his headquarters
at the Defense Ministry, Tanai sneaked to Bagram air base north of
the city, another cener for renegade forces.
   The early hours of the coup appeared to favor the mutineers.
Bombs at Kabul Radio forced officials to switch broadcasting
locations. Parliamentarian and alleged coup participant Saleh
Mohammad Zeray went to Radio Kabul to announce that Tanai's forces
had won.
   He was arrested with the statement in his pocket, a government
source said. Bakhtar reported Friday that he had been purged of his
party posts.
   The government was fighting back.
   Withering fire from loyalist tanks and rockets destroyed the
coup headquarters at the Defense Ministry located in the
pastel-colored Darulaman Palace, built after 1919 to house an
Afghan king.
   Loyalist tanks and footsoldiers with hand-held rockets
surrounded the building during a 24 hour assault. On Friday, the
building was a shell of its former self, with huge holes gaping
from its facade.
   An onslaught of gunfire destroyed another palace, the Tajbig
near the Darulaman. A fire gutted most of the marble building. Food
lay rotting in an open oven.
   Government troops also attacked Bagram air base, another rebel
stronghold. By Tuesday night, government forces were firing Scud
and Katyusha rockets at the base, destroying it. By Wednesday
afternoon, most of the fighting had stopped.
   Arrests began. Five members of the Politburo, including Tanai,
were purged from their posts. Some escaped and some have
disappeared. Two Central Committee members, including Zeray, also
were removed.
   Squads of security forces entered government housing projects
and arrested scores of alleged participants, government sources
said.
   One trial began Thursday. A special tribunal set up by Najib
will handle the case.
   The Bakhtar news agency promised punishment ``in accordance with
Afghan tradition.'' Death sentences were expected.

   A major manufacturer of outdoor barbecue
grills and accessories is warning consumers to check their
equipment before firing up because a part may be defective.
   The Illinois-based Thermos Co. said this week it is voluntarily
replacing a component part of its ``Thermos'' and ``Structo'' gas
barbecue grills because it might leak gas and cause a fire.
   Thermos said it would replace the hose, valve and regulator
assembly of the two models. Approximately 87,600 grills sold since
April 1989 may be involved, the company said.
   The company said the retrofitting program applies only to models
stamped ``Taiwan Pao-An Ind. Co.'' with serial numbers between
721791 and 886390.
   The stamp can be found on the round metal regulator which
connects to the liquid propane gas tank that sits on a shelf under
the grill.
   Consumers with the defective grills should call the Thermos Co.
at 1-800-446-0475 between 9 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. EST weekdays.

<HEAD>Mongolian Communists Agree to Consider Resignation of Leadership</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Mongolian Communist Party Central Committee
bowed to mass demonstrations Friday and agreed to consider ousting
the entire ruling Politburo, Tass reported.
   The announcement by Mongolian President and Communist Party
leader Zhambyn Batmunh on the land-locked nation's television
marked the first time that the revolution sweeping through the
Communist bloc has threatened a regime in Asia.
   Friday's events brought the wave of political reform to the
doorstep of China, which has crushed its own democracy movement
last spring with the army attack on protesters in Beijing.
   Protesters crowded the vast central square of Ulan Bator, the
Mongolian capital, on Friday to demand a new constitution and
creation of a provisional congress with the participation of all
public forces, the Soviet news agency said. It gave no estimate of
the size of the crowd, but said the site is normally deserted on a
workday.
   Demonstrators in the square also demanded an emergency party
congress and change in the party's leadership.
   Many speakers called for a general strike starting Saturday,
Tass said.
   Batmunh responded Friday evening on national television with the
promise that the Communist Party's Central Committee will meet
Monday to consider the resignation of the top leaders in the
Politburo and the convening of a special party congress, Tass said.
   Batmunh also promised a referendum so the people could cast a
vote of confidence, or lack of it, in the Great People's Hural, or
congress.
   Tass said members of the Mongolian Democratic Union and other
public movements ended their three-day hunger strike after the
announcement Friday, because their demands had been met.
   Tass apparently was referring to the group's immediate goals,
because the Democratic Union also is calling for an end to the
Communist Party's 69-year monopoly on power, a multiparty system
and resignation of the premier, Cabinet and congress.
   Premier Dumaagiyn Sodnom said Thursday the government would
cooperate with the Democratic Union on reforms.
   Foreign sources estimated 8,000 to 10,000 Mongolians
demonstrated Sunday in the central square in front of the congress
building. Speakers at that rally demanded the Communist Party give
up its 69-year monopoly on power.
   Protesters also have been complaining about long-term Soviet
domination of their nation of 2 million people, accusing their
enormous neighbor of ``pushing Mongolia into a debtor's prison'' by
forcing it to build enormous, unprofitable construction projects
with Soviet help and paying poorly for Mongolia's valuable natural
resources, said the Soviet newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda on
Wednesday.
   Western economists estimate Mongolia's debt to the Soviet Union
at nearly $6 billion.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda was defensive about the history of Soviet
relations with Mongolia but said the protesters were just in
criticizing the bureaucratic system and demanding faster
``perestroika.'' The Soviet newspaper used the same word for
``reconstruction'' that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev uses
for his reform program.
   Mongolian protesters also have demanded the removal of 60,000
Soviet troops and 50,000 Soviet advisers and their families. Soviet
officials agreed last week to withdraw all their troops from
Mongolia by 1992, as part of Gorbachev's announced pull-back of
Soviet forces around the world.

   Thousands of nimble-fingered competitors lined up
to be mesmerized, Tetrisized and bamboozled at the Nintendo World
Championships, and an 11-year-old video-game whizkid had an advice
line open for strugglers.
   Organizers expected more than 40,000 people to attend the
four-day championships that opened in a Dallas exhibition hall
Thursday night. More than 1 million people are likely to try their
luck during a 34-city tour that ends in Orlando in November, the
organizers said.
   It was a time of heartbreak and joy for youngsters taking their
first jab at video glory.
   John Mulhausen looked a cinch to win his age bracket. As others
struggled to score 150,000, the 11-year-old breezed through the
quarter-finals with scores of 410,000 and 343,700. The game master
told the crowd John was visiting from outer space.
   Winning is simply a matter of concentration.
   ``The thing is, to keep your mind clear and alert and try to go
for it,'' he said.
   His father, also named John, acknowledged that ``it's pretty
exciting watching him.''
   ``A lot of kids call him and ask him questions about games,'' he
said.
   Organizers set up a ``power walk'' where visitors can play
Nintendo video games on about 250 hand-held and full-size
terminals. That is, until they can't take it anymore.
   Kathy Prather described the $2 million show as ``a Las Vegas
setup of video game entertainment.''
   ``With 20 million Nintendo households nationwide, everybody
plays it at home, so why not have a video game showdown?'' she said.
   Nintendo Entertainment Systems, produced by Japanese-owned
Nintendo of America Inc., has led the resurgence in home video
games, with a unit in one out of every four American homes.
   It has sold more than 100 million game cartridges, and expects
to hit 171.5 million by the end of the year. Nintendo was the No. 1
selling toy last year, with estimated sales of $2.7 billion.
   Nintendo features hero characters Mario and his brother Luigi,
who seek to rescue Princess Toadstool in the popular Super Mario
Brothers games.
   For an admission price of $12.50 for adults and $9.50 for under
18-year-olds, visitors get unlimited playing time on the games,
most of which are not yet available commercially, Ms. Prather said.
Advisers were on hand to help stumped enthusiasts.
   For an additional $3, you can try your fingers in the
competition, which features three games: the original Super Mario
Brothers, Rad Racer and Tetris, one of the current favorites. The
top scorers advance to succeeding levels of competition, with city
champions competing in Orlando.
   Rad Racer is a racing game and Tetris, developed by a Soviet
programmer, is a geometric puzzle where players try to fit
different shapes into straight lines.
   The exhibition will be packed into 54 trailer trucks and hauled
to Cleveland next week. Other stops include Philadelphia,
Pittsburgh, Detroit, Indianapolis, Boston, New York and Chicago.

<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency's program
to reduce air pollution over national parks and wilderness areas is
so riddled with shortcomings that most polluters escape federal
regulation, a congressional study said Friday.
   Only about 1 percent of all the pollution sources studied,
accounting for about 10 percent of the pollution, are regulated,
the General Accounting Office said in a report on pollution of five
parks and wilderness areas.
   A dozen years after enactment of laws to preserve clean air over
national parks and wilderness areas ``the federal program set up to
do the job have either failed or have never been tried,'' said Rep.
Mike Synar, D-Okla.
   Synar is chairman of the Government Operations subcommittee on
environment, energy and natural resources, which asked for the
study by the General Accounting Office and conducted a hearing on
it Friday. The GAO is the investigatory arm of Congress,
   William Rosenberg, the EPA's assistant administrator for air and
radiation, acknowledged that some national parks are experiencing
poor air quality because of pollution from nearby urban areas or in
some cases pollution that may originate hundreds of miles away.
   The EPA pollution control program for parks and wilderness areas
``was never designed or envisioned to affect sources which existed
prior to 1977 unless or until they undergo major modification ...
(and) was structured to focus primarily on major sources,''
Rosenberg told the subcommittee.
   The five areas studied were affected by 2,330 stationary sources
of pollution, the GAO said, but only 27 were regulated.
   The rest were exempt either because they were too small to come
under the statute or had existed before enactment of the 1977 law,
although they together accounted for some 90 percent of the
pollution over the parks and wilderness grounds.
   Among the pollutants found in the air at the five sites were
sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, smoke, dust and
soot and ozone.
   The investigators said that although only five locations were
examined, similar pollution likely exists in most of the other 153
national parks or wilderness areas singled out for special air
quality control treatment under 1977 amendments to the Clean Air
Act.
   The five locations examined by the GAO were the Rocky Mountain
National Park and Flat Tops Wilderness Area, both in Colorado; the
Shenandoah National Park and James River Face Wilderness Area in
Virginia; and the Cape Romain Wilderness Area in South Carolina.
   At Shenandoah, where ozone levels in 1988 exceeded national
health standards, 83 percent and 95 percent of two chemicals that
create smog came from sources that were exempt from the
regulations, the GAO said.
   At the two Colorado sites nearly two-thirds of the smoke, dust
and soot found in the air came from small sources not covered by
the regulations, the agency continued.
   The GAO recommended that the EPA review air quality programs at
more parks and wilderness areas and if similar situations are
found, ask Congress to tighten the provisions so smaller and older
sources of pollution are covered by the control requirements.

   An Air Force cargo jet carrying 26
people lost partial use of its landing gear during takeoff from
Panama on Friday and landed at Robins Air Force Base, officials
said.
   The C-141 jet landed at 3:45 p.m. It came in on its left landing
gear, which was functional, and only brief sparks and smoke were
visible as the right side of the plane came down on the runway.
   Emergency crews sprayed firefighting foam on the plane as a
precaution. There were no immediate reports of injuries.
   The plane was ``bringing military people out of Panama, back to
their bases,'' when it lost its right main landing gear upon
takeoff at Howard Air Force Base, said Cliff Tyler, a Robins
spokesman.
   The four-engine plane originally was headed for Charleston Air
Force Base in South Carolina and is based at McGuire Air Force Base
in New Jersey, Tyler said.
   Robins is a major repair center for C-141s.

   A 10-year-old Arab girl died Friday, one day
after being wounded during a clash with Israeli soldiers, as
Palestinians held a general strike to mark the beginning of the
28th month of their uprising, Arab reports said.
   Fourteen Palestinians were reported wounded in clashes in the
occupied Gaza Strip on Friday, hospital officials there said.
   Doctors at Jenin Hosptial in the occupied West Bank said the
girl, Ibib Zekarneh, was admitted Thursday after being hit in the
head with a steel pellet.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   Her death brought to 660 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli soldiers or civilians since the uprising against Israeli
occupation began in December 1987. Forty-three Israelis have also
died in the violence.
   In the Bureij refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, Israeli troops
fired tear gas and plastic bullets to break up an anniversary
demonstration and at least eight Palstinians were wounded, hospital
officials said.
   They said one casualty was an 18-year-old youth who was shot in
the head and was transferred to a hospital in Israel in critical
condition.
   At least six other Palestinians were wounded during
stone-throwing clashes with Israeli troops in the Gaza Strip,
hospital officials said.
   Also Friday, a 29-year-old Lebanese man suspected of
collaborating with Israel was found strangled in a prison shower,
Israeli reports said.
   Neither Israel radio nor the national news agency Itim
identified the man, but said he was serving a life term in Ashkelon
prison for security offenses.
   The reports said prison authorities suspected his cell mate, a
Palestinian from the Gaza Strip, killed the prisoner in the belief
he was a collaborator.
   Prison officials could not be reached for comment.
   At least 194 Arabs have been killed by Palestinians during the
revolt, most on suspicion of collaborating with Israeli authorities.
   The general strike was called by the underground leadership of
the insurrection and the Islamic Resistance Movement-Hamas, and was
widely observed throughout lands seized from Jordan and Egypt in
the 1967 Middle East war, Arab reports said.
   In Bethlehem, shops closed and most workers stayed home. Among
the slogans that appeared throughout the city, one read, ``The
Unified National Command commits its people to continuing the
uprising,'' Arab reports said.
   Entrances to many villages were blocked with stones and burning
tires to prevent people from going to work and students stayed out
of schools.
   Arab reporters said the streets of Nablus were deserted and
transportation came to a halt. Only military jeeps and trucks could
be seen moving.
   Security forces in the Gaza Strip sealed one room of a
three-room house in the Bureij camp belonging to 21-year-old Hamed
Salem, who was arrested early this year and charged with throwing
stones at Israeli cars.

<TEXT>
   Taiwan's justice chief said Friday he will
drop his challenge to President Lee Teng-hui in this month's
presidential election, defusing a crisis that threatened to split
the ruling party.
   The announcement leaves a clear path to election for Lee, who
was endorsed last month as the official candidate of the ruling
Nationalist Party.
   The party's elder members are uncomfortable with Lee, a native
Taiwanese, because they fear he does not share their intense desire
to return to the Chinese mainland and believe he is trying to amass
too much power.
   Lin Yang-kang, the popular 62-year-old judiciary chief, made the
announcement he would drop from the race after a 20-minute meeting
with eight party veterans who Lee had asked to find a resolution to
the political battle.
   ``I decided that I should not do anything to hurt the nation and
people's welfare,'' Lin told reporters afterward.
   About 200 aging members of the electoral college had thrown
their support behind Lin for president and Chiang Wego, the sole
surviving son of Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, for vice
president.
   The 752-seat electoral college, known as the National Assembly,
is dominated by politicians who fled the Chinese mainland to Taiwan
with the rest of the Nationalist government in 1949 after losing a
civil war to Communist forces.
   They have not faced re-election since then, frozen in office to
support the Nationalist government's claim to still be the
legitimate ruler of all China.
   Lin said he would soon ask the elderly politicians ``to drop the
idea'' of endorsing him. ``I was told that people felt uneasy about
the emergence of a second ticket in the election because it would
force them to take sides.''
   The official radio reported that Lee thanked Lin for his
decision. The electoral college is expected to officially chose the
president March 21.
   Lee, 66, succeeded President Chiang Ching-kuo when he died in
office in 1987. The late president was another son of Chiang
Kai-shek.
   China made a public expression of concern over the political
bickering this week, but it was not clear if those statements
affected Friday's developments. Beijing, which seeks reunification
with Taiwan, condemned the ``instability'' caused by the
Nationalist rift.
   Chiang Wego, viewed by many of the older assemblymen as the
defender of their dream of returning to the mainland, was not
available Friday for comment. In the past, he has said he would not
actively campaign but would not discourage the electoral college
from supporting him.
   A fire meanwhile broke out in the national legislature Friday,
and police blamed activists who want Taiwan to drop its claim to be
China's legitimate government.
   Police said the early morning blaze may have been caused by
firebombs. Several reception rooms were reported damaged.
   Nearby, police discovered a fence painted with the slogan:
``Burn Chinese pirates to death. Strive for Taiwanese
independence'' and ``Bloodbath Taiwan.'' The references were
apparently to elderly members of the Yuan, Taiwan's highest
lawmaking body, who fled mainland China decades ago.
   Less than an hour later, a blaze occurred at the faculty
dormitory at National Taiwan University, with similar slogans left
behind.
   No one was reported injured in either fire, and there was no
claim of responsibility.
   Also Friday, Chiang Hsiao-wu, son of late President Chiang
Ching-kuo, said he would resign as head of Taiwan's mission to
Japan because he was disappointed over ``our leaders' fighting over
power without any regard to the nation's future.''
   He criticized Chiang Wego for ``wanting to be elected but
claiming he would not campaign.'' But he said he would not ``waste
my time'' to persuade his uncle to pull out of the race.
   In an effort to placate his critics, President Lee said
Wednesday that party members would be consulted over whether he
should continue as party chairman as well as head of government.
   Newspapers reported that Lin, backed by the aging conservatives,
wants Lee to step down as party chairman to allow a collective
leadership after the presidential election.
   The 3-year-old opposition Democratic Progressive Party does not
have enough members in the National Assembly to nominate its own
candidate for president. It has demanded all the mainland Chinese
assemblymen retire and that the president be chosen by popular
election.

<HEAD>Sperm Banks: Safe as Savings Banks?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sperm banks keep records so detailed it's
unlikely a bank is to blame in the case of a white woman who says
she was impregnated with a black man's sperm rather than her dying
husband's, experts said Friday.
   But if the nation's three dozen major sperm banks are as safe as
savings banks, they aren't nearly as regulated. New York is the
only state to license sperm banks, and the federal government lacks
control over them.
   The issue arose this week after it was disclosed a New York
woman is suing a fertility clinic and a sperm bank, claiming her
late husband's sperm was switched with that of a black man.
   The woman says that after she was fertilized with the sperm she
gave birth to a girl who appears to be half black.
   David Gould, the attorney for the Queens resident, asked that
her name be withheld because of emotional distress. The girl, now
3, has been taunted because she doesn't look like her parents.
   In 1985, the couple paid Idant Laboratories, the nation's oldest
and largest commercial sperm bank, to store the husband's sperm. He
had cancer, and the couple feared chemotherapy could damage his
sperm. Such concerns, Idant says, account for about half its
deposits.
   The woman later contacted Advanced Fertility Services to get the
sperm samples from Idant and use them for insemination.
   Advanced says the sperm it used came from Idant; Idant says the
sperm it sent was definitely the husband's, and couldn't be the
sperm that impregnated the wife.
   Dr. Jerome Sherman, chairman of American Association of Tissue
Banks' reproductive council, said sperm banks' identification
procedures are designed to avoid such confusion.
   ``The chance of this happening is extremely remote, if not
impossible,'' he said. ``I've visited that facility (Idant) and
seen their identification procedures. It couldn't be run any
better, as far as labeling is concerned.''
   It was much more likely, he said, that a woman lodging such a
complaint had sexual intercourse with someone other than the sperm
donor.
   Steven Salzman, another attorney for the woman, denied Sherman's
suggestion, but said it was not yet clear if fault rested with the
fertility clinic or the sperm bank.
   At most sperm banks, a man ejaculates into a container that is
marked with his personal identification code and the date. Then it
is tested, divided into small units, placed in small plastic
straws, and frozen.
   The straws are lodged inside an aluminum container that looks
like a cigar tube, which also bears a label with the donor's code.
It, in turn, is placed in a large tank of liquid nitrogen, which
keeps the sperm at minus 320 degrees.
   Meanwhile, a log of the sperm's history _ when, how and where it
was donated, tested, frozen and stored _ is compiled. Any
withdrawal also is marked down. An inventory of all sperm deposits
is taken periodically.
   In the case at issue, Idant says its records show the sperm it
sent to the clinic was the husband's _ five straws are gone from
his cigar tube and no one else's straws are missing _ and that a
test showed the baby's DNA didn't match the husband's.
   Sherman, a University of Arkansas medicine professor who directs
a sperm bank in Little Rock, said his facility stores donor sperm
of different races in different vaults. Idant uses colored plastic
straws to indicate a donor's race.
   ``You have had situations where technicians have goofed and the
semen was thawed, but mixups like the one this woman claims,
never,'' Sherman said.
   William Andrews, medical director of the American Fertility
Society, said the labeling errors that periodically complicate
blood transfusions don't crop up in artificial inseminations
because sperm banks aren't responding to emergencies and have more
time to double- and cross-check.
   He also noted that since the vast majority of sperm samples are
donated by whites, the odds against a switch like the one alleged
are particularly long.
   Given the absence of government regulation, however, consumers
must be sure a sperm bank follows record-keeping procedures
recommended by the federal Center for Disease Control and the
fertility association.
   Mary Anne Gardineer of the state Health Department said the New
York sperm bank regulations that took effect in October weren't
prompted by any problem, but by a concern that inadequate screening
of anonymous sperm donors might lead to the transmission of AIDS.
   She said she had never heard of any mixup like the one alleged
in the lawsuit, but said her department would review the
regulations to see if a more definitive identification of a donor's
sperm should be required.
   Her colleague, Dr. Jean Linden, concurred: ``As in any other
form of banking, record keeping is very, very important.''

<HEAD>Massachusetts Republicans Optimistic as They Open Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL BEEGAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Republicans, long considered
politically dead, gathered Friday for their state convention in an
upbeat mood, sensing a chance to win the governor's race for the
first time since 1970.
   Ron Kaufman, the Republican National Committeeman from
Massachusetts and an White House aide to President Bush, summed up
expectations.
   ``Quite frankly I think the folks in Washington for the first
time really believe that the Republican Party can actually win this
state,'' he said.
   The Republicans have been boosted by Democratic Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis' heavy defeat in the 1988 presidential election and by the
state's financial woes.
   The ``Massachusetts Miracle'' that Dukakis used as a cornerstone
of his campaign has evaporated.
   The latest bad economic news came Friday with the announcement
that the state's unemployment rate jumped from 4.5 percent to 5.3
percent in February. State government faces a budget deficit this
year in excess of half a billion dollars.
   Polls show Dukakis' popularity has dropped to an all-time low.
Although the governor is not seeking re-election, Kaufman and other
GOP leaders said they hope to channel dissatisfaction into votes
for the GOP in a state where Democrats still outnumber Republicans
by 3-1 in party registration.
   Endorsements will be the major task facing the more than 5,000
delegates expected to attend the convention.
   The delegates will vote Saturday on who to support for governor,
lieutenant governor, U.S. Senate and other statewide offices.
   Candidates need not win the endorsement to appear on the Sept.
18 primary election ballot, but must win support from a minimum of
15 percent of the delegates.
   The weeks before the convention have been marked by sharp
campaign rhetoric between the party's two front-runners in the
governor's race, House Minority Leader Steven Pierce and former
federal prosecutor William Weld, and between Senate contenders Dan
Daly and Jim Rappaport.
   Kaufman said he was not upset by the tough campaigning.
   ``In terms of Massachusetts politics what's been going on in our
party is kind of weak, kind of mild,'' he said. ``Basically the
whole thing's been a plus. It's been a good thing for our party.''
   He said it has boosted the name recognition of the candidates.
   Under Republican rules, if a candidate wins a ``super majority''
of the delegates, a margin of 15 percent in a three-way race and 20
percent in a two-way race, the GOP will provide aid before the
primary.
   But Kaufman said he still would favor a primary election
campaign.
   ``I've always been in favor of a good primary,'' Kaufman said.
   Otherwise, he said the Democrats, who hold their convention in
June and are guaranteed a primary, could dominate media coverage
until after the primary. And that could put the GOP at a
disadvantage, he said.
   The last time the Republicans won the governor's race was in
1970 when Francis Sargent defeated Kevin White. Dukakis defeated
Sargent in 1974 and has been in charge since, except for a
four-year period when then Democrat Edward King defeated him in the
primary and won the governorship.
   Since leaving office after losing to Dukakis in 1982, King has
switched to the GOP.

   Their lives are linked by a common memory: a cool
Vietnamese river on a steamy day, gunfire, then chaos. Each thought
the other had died.
   But this weekend in St. Louis, 21 years later, the paths of Jim
Lahr and Denver Lawson Freeman cross once again.
   Lahr is to receive the Bronze Star for pulling his wounded
buddy, Freeman, and another Marine from the river's green waters to
safety. Lahr was shot and paralyzed from the waist down as he
returned to the river for a third wounded man.
   One of the men rescued by Lahr died. The captain who that day
began the paperwork to commend Lahr was wounded in another raid the
same week.
   Lahr believed Freeman was dead; Freeman thought the same of Lahr.
   But at a Marine Corps reunion last summer, Freeman learned that
Lahr had survived, and set out to see that his friend receive the
honor he deserved.
   ``That started the ball rolling,'' Marine Sgt. Major Wallace
Poyner said Friday from St. Louis.
   Freeman ``started letters going and petitioned this. They wrote
it up, sent it into the awards section of the Marine Corps, and it
went to the Secretary of the Navy, who approved it.''
   The retired colonel who headed Lahr's unit in Vietnam was to
present the award at a ceremony Saturday, Poyner said.
   On March 21, 1969, while on patrol, Lahr, Freeman and other
Marines walked out of the jungle to fill their canteens at the
river, the citation says.
   Bullets and grenades began to fly, and ``Corporal Lahr, with
complete disregard for his own safety ... assisted several Marines
to safety.
   ``Despite the heavy fire, he made several trips ... until he
himself was wounded and unable to continue,'' the citation says.
   Freeman and his wife were en route Friday from their home in
South Charleston, W.Va., to the ceremony, said his mother, Juanita
Freeman.
   ``My son was so excited about it. ... This has really been a
great lift in both of their lives,'' Mrs. Freeman said by telephone.
   ``He knows he can never, never, repay Jim. But he feels that
somehow, now that he knows he's alive, he'll be able to do some
things to return the favor to Jim.''
   Lahr downplayed his heroism during a telephone interview Friday
from his home in the central Illinois community of Lincoln.
   ``I did it on an impulse,'' said Lahr, who is confined to a
wheelchair. ``I knew there was danger involved, but I went ahead.
Like I said, it was done on an impulse to get the men out of the
area.''
   After he was wounded, Lahr recalls hearing one of his commanding
officers call him by his nickname _ ``Where ya at, Little Bit?''
   But he remembers nothing more until he awoke on a hospital ship
some days later.
   His injury came 16 days before he completed his 13-month tour in
Vietnam.
   Freeman also was seriously injured and remained in a full-body
cast for months, his mother said.
   ``They thought he was going to lose his life, but oh, he just
came out great,'' Mrs. Freeman said. ``Honey, listen, I just thank
God over and over for Jim.''
   She said she met Lahr this summer while he was visiting her son.
   ``The first thing I told him, I said, `I always hoped that
someday I could tell you just how much we love you.''
   Today, Lahr spends most of his time in activities with local
veterans' groups.
   ``It feels real good,'' he said of the upcoming ceremonies.
``The Bronze Star _ I wish all the rest of them could get them
too.''

<TEXT>
   The mansion where TV evangelists Jim and
Tammy Bakker once luxuriated amid his-and-hers bathroom suites,
three kitchens and an air-condition doghouse was destroyed by fire
early Friday.
   The 10,226-square-foot home on a hill overlooking Lake Wylie _
which once featured exercise rooms and as many as 25 room-sized
closets _ was bought and remodeled by New Jersey businessman Robert
Rubino in 1988.
   Rubino, who paid $685,000 for the house after the collapse of
the Bakkers' religious empire, was out of town and the house
unoccupied when the fire was reported at 2:15 a.m., said Tega Cay
Volunteer Fire Department Chief Bill Kruysman.
   ``It looked like a volcano spewing up,'' said Kruysman, adding
that the five-level home's the layout hampered firefighters. ``This
house is huge. It has been added on and added on, and there have
been additions to the additions.''
   The now-bankrupt PTL ministry bought the home in one of Tega
Cay's most exclusive sections in 1981 as a parsonage, and enlarged
it four times while it was home to the Bakkers and their two
children.
   The Bakkers moved out of the home when they left the ministry in
June 1987, three months after Bakker admitted to a sex-and-money
scandal in 1980 with church secretary Jessica Hahn.
   Bakker 50, was convicted of defrauding his followers of $3.7
million, and is serving a 45-year federal prison sentence in
Rochester, Minn.
   Tammy Faye Bakker lives in Orlando, Fla., where she is started a
successor ministry to PTL. Neither were available to comment Friday
on the fate of their former home.
   The South Carolina Arson Task Force was investigating the cause
of the fire, said Kruysman. That doesn't indicate arson is
suspected, but rather is standard procedure in fires of unknown
origin, he said.
   At one point, the home's master bedroom had his-and-hers
bathroom suites connected by a sunken whirlpool tub. The tub was
flanked by a glass-enclosed rock garden. Faucet handles were shaped
like swans.
   A 600-square-foot carpeted clothes closet adjoined Mrs. Bakker's
dressing room.
   The main kitchen had industrial-grade appliances, and the home
also featured two additional kitchens and electronically controlled
drapes and curtains.
   The grounds included an air-conditioned doghouse, two-story
heated and air-conditioned playhouse, guardhouse, boardwalks to a
white sandy beach at the water's edge, and a large dock where the
Bakkers once kept their 58-foot houseboat and small power cruiser.
   Mrs. Bakker and her followers are building a home for her New
Covenant Church in a 15,200-square-foot building outside Orlando.
   Donnie Beck, who oversees New Covenant's direct-mail
fund-raising, said the ministry was in the process of buying the
building, but refused to give a price.

   Presidential candidate Mario Vargas Llosa and
several other intellectuals on Friday declared communism dead and
urged Fidel Castro to call free elections in Cuba.
   The group, in Lima for a conference entitled ``The Liberty
Revolution,'' said if the Cuban president refuses, then ``history
will condemn you for all of eternity.''
   The three-day meeting was organized by the Liberty Movement, a
group of politicians and businessmen that formed around Vargas
Llosa as he entered the race for presidency.
   Vargas Llosa, a celebrated author who is favored to win the
April 8 presidential election, is the candidate for the Democratic
Front, a coalition of center-right parties and the Liberty Movement.
   The theme of the conference was the political changes taking
place in Latin America, Eastern Europe and elsewhere.
   The letter to Castro, issued Friday by conference participants,
accused the Cuban leader of proposing a ``holocaust'' by promising
to destroy the island before abandoning Communism.
   ``What has been sunk throughout the world, Comandante, is
communism,'' the letter said.

<HEAD>Bank Trouble Reported in Nicaragua</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Central Bank official refused Friday
to confirm or deny President Daniel Ortega's statement that
uncertainty over next month's transfer of government to the United
National Opposition caused a run on banks.
   But people reported their bank accounts were frozen and bank
officials said earlier that funds simply weren't there to cover
withdrawals in dollars or cordobas, the national currency.
   The newly elected 14-party UNO coalition meanwhile issued a
communique warning that giveaways of government property ``will be
reviewed in detail to ascertain their legality and origin'' _
presumably once President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro and her
government take over April 25.
   It was referring to reports that government property from file
folders to vehicles is being given away or sold off to leave UNO an
empty shell of a state structure and make it harder for the
coalition to function as a government.
   It also referred to a proposed law that would enable tenants of
public housing to obtain legal ownership.
   Much of the property was confiscated from ousted dictator
Anastasio Somoza and the people around him during the Sandinistas'
10{ years in power.
   But other property was seized from Sandinista critics who ran
afoul of the government or from citizens who left Nicaragua for
more than six months.
   The Sandinista-dominated National Assembly is to vote on the law
Saturday.
   Ortega said Thursday night that refusal of the U.S.-supported
Contra rebels to disband before Mrs. Chamorro is inaugurated was
creating tensions.
   Concern over a peaceful transfer of power increased after Ortega
warned in his speech that ``there are thousands of weapons in the
hands of the people'' and that he ``could not guarantee'' the
situation will be normal come April 25.
   Ortega said jittery customers cleaned millions of dollars and
billions of cordobas out of their bank accounts after UNO defeated
his Sandinistas in national elections Feb. 25.
   The black market rate for the cordoba is about 70,000 to the
dollar.
   The pro-Sandinista newspaper El Nuevo Diario ran a front-page
story Friday that spoke of more than $100 million being withdrawn
from bank accounts.
   ``If he (Ortega) says it's so, then I'm nobody to deny it,''
said Orlando Mogollon, banking services director at the Central
Bank. But when pressed, Mogollon backed off.
   ``I can't confirm or deny it,'' he said of the reported run on
banks.
   Nicaragua's banking system is nationalized and controlled by the
Central Bank.
   Emilio Mayorga, an official of the National Development Bank,
denied there was a run on his bank.
   ``Withdrawals are normal,'' said Mayorga. ``We don't understand
this thing about a drain'' on accounts.
   A secretarial worker who tried this week to withdraw the
equivalent of $300 from her savings account said she was told by a
bank teller her account was frozen until May. No further
explanation was offered.
   She admitted she wanted to have the cash ``because things have
become so insecure.''
   A foreign diplomat reported that bank officials told him this
week that there weren't enough funds in an account from one of the
best hotels in Managua to cash a check for $500.
   A private foreign citizen said officials at his bank told him he
could not withdraw money from his dollar account because the bank
lacked funds.
   All three spoke on condition of anonymity.
   One of two government-controlled money exchange houses in
Managua shut down Friday. Telephone calls to its offices were
unanswered.

   The Bush administration is preparing a
Nicaragua aid package focusing on agricultural help and is
discussing moving the Contra rebels to enclaves under United
Nations supervision, officials on Vice President Quayle's trip said
Friday.
   The enclaves would provide an interim refuge for the Contras to
be safe from militant remnants of the Sandinista army, said one
administration official.
   ``That might be a way station to disarmament,'' he said when
asked whether the administration envisions having the Contras keep
their weapons in such camps.
   The Nicaragua aid package will be formally announced next week,
Quayle said at a news conference following his meeting with
Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez.
   Agricultural assistance, providing such necessities as seed and
fertilizer for the April planting season, also will help the
Contras resettle in their homeland since most are from rural
backgrounds, said the first official.
   Quayle discussed with Perez and Spain's Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez the possibility of having the Contras move into enclaves
in Nicaragua with United Nations peacekeeping forces to ``separate
the armies'' that have been warring for a decade, the official said.
   The future of the U.S.-built Contra army has been a key issue
since the Feb. 25 election of opposition candidate Violeta Chamorro
over Sandinista President Daniel Ortega.
   Demobilizing the Contras and a peaceful transfer of power were
the chief topics of the meeting between Quayle, Perez and Gonzalez.
   Quayle and Gonzalez are both on the way to Sunday's inauguration
in Chile, which Ortega will also attend.
   Perez and Gonzalez pressed Quayle ``very hard'' on the need to
disband the Contras at once, said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
who is accompanying Quayle to Chile and was in Friday's meetings.
   The United States also wants the Contras to disband before Mrs.
Chamorro is inaugurated on April 25, but the Bush administration
has insisted their security be insured.
   The administration envisions the Contras beginning to demobilize
at the same time as the Sandinistas relinquish their control of the
army, said the official who briefed reporters. The Sandinistas have
been taking steps to retain control of some aspects of the
government, and Ortega has said the Sandinistas will keep control
of the 70,000-man army, Central America's largest.
   Kennedy said he told Perez and Gonzalez there was ``heavy
skepticism'' in Congress about Ortega's willingness to turn the
government over to Mrs. Chamorro.
   Participants in the meeting hosted by Perez at his summer
beachfront home said there were disagreements over whether Ortega
could be trusted.
   Quayle, who said he spoke to Mrs. Chamorro from Air Force two on
Friday morning, held that he would rather put his trust in her.
   The U.S. official who briefed reporters said Perez was looking
into the possibility of having his government join the U.N.
peackeeping force that already is assigned to Nicaragua.
   The U.S. officials did not disclose how much aid President Bush
will propose for Nicaragua.
   Chamorro's government has said it needs some $200 to $300
million to get Nicaragua's ailing economiy back on track.
   After the meeting and news conference, Quayle flew to Barbados
for talks with Caribbean heads of state and is flying on Saturday
to Chile.
   Earlier, Quayle aides had said they anticipated the Perez
meeting would also focus on Bush's push for Latin governments to
recognize the U.S.-installed government of Panama. But that did not
come up, said Quayle's press secretary David Beckwith.
   Perez was one of the region's most vocal critics of the Dec. 20
invasion, which was widely deplored in the Latin world.
   Thanks in part to diplomatic effots by Perez, however, recent
days have seen restoration of normal ties with Panama by Venezuela,
Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, said Beckwith.
   Their actions came after President Guillermo Endara on March 1
called for a national vote on changes he proposed to Panama's
constitution. That, along with withdrawal of the U.S. invasion
troops by mid-February, was seen as fulfilling calls by Panama's
neighbors for an election to give Endara's government an electoral
stamp of approval.
   The countries that are still holding out against recognizing
Endara are Brazil, Uruguay, Mexico and Chile, said Beckwith.

   The parliament of the Soviet republic of Georgia
on Friday condemned its forcible annexation to the Soviet Union
more than a half-century ago and demanded talks on restoration of
its independence, a local news agency reported.
   Georgia thus becomes the fourth of the 15 Soviet republics after
the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia to take action
condemning its being incorporated into the Soviet Union.
   Lithuania's parliament is expected to vote on a formal
declaration of independence on Sunday.
   The Georgian parliament, called the Supreme Soviet, also
condemned the proposal made by Mikhail S. Gorbachev to create a
strong Soviet presidency, according to Tass and a transcript of the
resolution read to The Associated Press over the telephone by the
Independent News Agency of Georgia.
   Tass in its four-sentence report said nothing about the sections
of the resolution condemning the Red Army's occupation of Georgia
in February 1921 and the subsequent treaties that made Georgia part
of the Soviet Union.
   Georgia has long had an active independence movement, but has
not pushed its case through parliamentary means. Many Georgian
independence leaders said that would be tacit admission of Soviet
power even though the Baltics have won greater autonomy and edged
closer to independence by using Gorbachev's reforms to elect
trusted local leaders.
   According to the Georgian independent news agency, the
resolution's text says, ``The Supreme Soviet of Georgia denounces
the occupation and annexation of Georgia by Soviet Russia and
considers it to be an international crime.'' It calls the entrance
of troops ``a military interference, intervention and occupation
with the aim of overthrowing the existing political order.''
   ``It is necessary to start talks on restoration of an
independent state of Georgia,'' the resolution says.
   The southern Caucasus republic has 5 million residents. Georgia,
mountainous and on the eastern shore of the Black Sea, first became
a part of the Russian empire in the early 1800s. It was briefly
independent again after the Bolshevik revolution.
   Last April, Soviet troops armed with gas and shovels killed 19
pro-independence demonstrators while chasing them off the main
street of Georgia's capital Tbilisi.
   The Georgian resolution also says it is ``inadmissible'' to
adopt the section of the law that allows the president to declare a
state of emergency and martial law, ``and to introduce an
authoritarian presidential rule, which may be interpreted as the
president's right to remove organs of power in a union republic and
thus to completely eliminate the republic's sovereignty.''
   Gorbachev hopes to win approval of the constitutional amendment
in Monday's special session of the Congress of People's Deputies,
despite progressives' complaints that the draft would give him
``dictatorial'' powers.
   The Georgian resolution says it is inadmissible for the
republic's deputies to participate in approving the draft.
   The resolution also says presidential measures taken to protect
the nation's territorial unity ``should not conflict with the
realization of a republic's right to secede from the USSR.''
   Lithuania moved up its vote on declaring independence to Sunday
precisely because activists fear Gorbachev will use his new powers
to forcibly prevent them from splitting from the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Idaho House Approves `Birth Control' Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK WARBIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state House approved a bill Friday that
would give Idaho the nation's most restrictive abortion law and
anti-abortion activists the test they want for a U.S. Supreme Court
stand on the issue.
   The measure passed 47-36 and was forwarded to the Senate after
more than three hours of sometimes emotional debate witnessed by
anti-abortion and pro-choice advocates packing the House gallery.
   The bill is scheduled to face a hearing Wednesday in the Senate
State Affairs Committee. It could come to a final floor vote as
early as Friday, and even opponents concede it stands a good chance
of passing.
   The bill, like legislation rejected in Minnesota and Utah, would
outlaw abortion as a method of birth control.
   The measure allows abortions only in cases of rape, incest,
``profound and irremediable'' fetal disabilities, or to save the
life or prevent ``severe and long-lasting physical health damage''
to the mother.
   Sponsors contend that would prevent more than 90 percent of the
approximately 1,600 abortions performed each year in Idaho.
   Penalties for ``civil contempt'' up to $10,000 for a first
offense, $30,000 for a second and $50,000 for each additional
violation could be assessed against any physician performing or
attempting to perform an abortion, but women undergoing the
procedure would not be held legally responsible.
   Gov. Cecil Andrus has not commented on the bill, but he has come
out strongly against abortion except in cases of rape, incest and a
threat to the life of the mother.
   Along with a Pennsylvania anti-abortion law, which has been
partially blocked by a federal court injunction, the Idaho bill
would be the most restrictive in the nation, according to its
sponsors and the National Right to Life Committee.
   ``I'm just so proud that Idahoans are taking the lead in
returning protection to our unborn children,'' said Kerry Uhlenkott
of Grangeville, legislative coordinator for Right to Life of Idaho
Inc. ``The Supreme Court is inviting us to send up legislation, and
that's what we're doing.''
   Pro-abortion forces were disappointed that legislators ignored
arguments that the measure would not pass constitutional muster,
and that most Idaho residents want the Legislature to stay out of
the issue, said a spokeswoman for the Idaho group Freedom Means
Choice.
   ``I consistently heard the word `morality' used, always ascribed
to the life of the unborn,'' said Sally Trott. ``I never heard it
used in reference to the state's obligation if it's going to coerce
a woman to carry a pregnancy to term.''
   On Thursday, the House approved and sent the Senate legislation
repealing the state's controversial ``trigger law,'' which sets
criminal penalties including prison terms up to five years both for
physicians performing and women receiving abortions.
   The trigger statute would have taken effect only if the U.S.
Supreme Court ever completely overturns its 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision legalizing the procedure through the first two trimesters
of pregnancy.
   After nearly 17 years of relative inactivity on abortion, Idaho
got back into the fray after last July's U.S. Supreme Court ruling
in a Missouri case.
   The case, Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, effectively
invited more strident challenges of the underlying law created by
Roe vs. Wade, anti-abortion advocates contend.
   The July decision was the focus of Friday's debate. ``We ought
not to fall victim to the idea that this bill is
unconstitutional,'' said Rep. L. Ed Brown, a Republican who is the
primary House sponsor. ``No one knows what's constitutional in this
case.''
   But opponents cited objections raised by Richard Wilkins, a
Brigham Young University law professor who is anti-abortion but
contends the birth control bill goes too far in challenging the
Supreme Court's stand. He said it would be found unconstitutional
on a number of grounds.
   ``I am honestly and geniunely convinced that if we pass this
bill, it will hurt the pro-life movement, that it will be struck
down,'' said Democratic Rep. Patricia McDermott, a Pocatello
attorney.

<HEAD>Prego Settles AIDS Suit for $1.35 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONALD POWERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A physician who maintains she contracted AIDS
from a contaminated needle settled her lawsuit for $1.35 million in
an agreement negotiated with the city hospital agency, the trial
judge revealed Friday.
   Veronica Prego, 32, will receive two-thirds of the award, or
$900,000, when it is paid by the city in about two weeks. The
remainder will go to the lawyers who represented her.
   After a trial that lasted more than two months, Prego
unexpectedly dropped her lawsuit and agreed to the out-of-court
settlement as the jury was scheduled to hear closing arguments. The
settlement was announced Thursday.
   Prego was unavailable Friday for comment on the settlement, one
of her lawyers said.
   The day before, Prego said she would use the money to help her
family and to provide for her medical expenses in ``the tough days
ahead.''
   Brooklyn state Justice Aaron D. Bernstein on Friday reversed his
order to participants not to disclose the amount after the New York
Post sued to have the settlement unsealed.
   The judge said he had issued the gag order to spare Prego the
embarrassment of being questioned by reporters about why she
settled for such a seemingly small sum.
   ``It was something that touched a chord with Dr. Prego. She
didn't want people to think that the value of the case was that
little,'' Bernstein said.
   ``I didn't want Dr. Prego to be questioned about the reason she
took that amount of money when she sued for so much more,'' he said.
   Prego initially sought $175 million when she sued the city
Health and Hospitals Corp. and two physicians, but the dollar
figure was later removed from the lawsuit, filed two years ago.
   In her lawsuit, Prego contended she had developed AIDS after
puncturing her finger with a contaminated needle carelessly left
amid soiled refuse on a patient's bed at Kings County Hospital.
   Bernstein, who considered the agreement ``fair,'' said Prego
reluctantly agreed to settle because she didn't want the case to be
tied up in the courts any longer.
   Hospitals Corp. lawyers had promised they would appeal if the
jury found for Prego, and an appeal could take two years or more.
During the trial, Prego's personal physician said she might have
less than a year to live.
   ``It's our belief they played hardball with a dying woman,'' one
of Prego's lawyers, Susan M. Karten said. ``I'm happy for her it's
over. I'm relieved. I'm just sorry for what she went through.''
   She said Prego was ready to settle for a lesser sum before
filing her negligence lawsuit two years ago, but the city refused.
   The Hospitals Corp. said it was pleased with the settlement.

   Oliver North testified Friday that John M.
Poindexter overrode his misgivings and let him be questioned by
lawmakers about covert aid to Nicarguan rebels, something that
could not ``be revealed to anyone.''
   The former White House aide, testifying as a reluctant leadoff
witness at the Iran-Contra trial of his boss and national security
adviser to President Reagan, admitted he lied when questioned by
House members about whether he was covertly helping arm the
Nicaraguan Contras.
   The retired Marine lieutenant colonel, declared a hostile
witness by the judge, insisted that ``no one ever told me to lie to
Congress'' about the covert operation to help the rebels after
Congress shut off money.
   But North said that when he told Poindexter his misgivings about
attending the meeting he was told: ``You can handle it, you can
take care of it.''
   North said he was ``concerned by the kind of questions they
might ask'' because ``I'd been told by two national security
adviers and their deputys, by the director of central intelligence
that that information was not to be revealed to anyone.''
   North said ``I didn't walk into the meeting intending to lie.''
   But the former National Security Council aide staff officer
admitted that he ``did not tell the truth'' during Aug. 6, 1986
session with members of the House Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence.
   ``I recall deceiving them about the full measure of my
involvement,'' said North.
   Poindexter, a retired Navy rear admiral who was national
security adviser for President Reagan in 1986, is accused, among
other things of putting North up to lying at the meeting.
   Compelled to testify by Iran-Contra prosecutors, North conceded
few points without a struggle during a day of relentless
questioning by prosecutor Dan Webb.
   When Congress banned U.S. military aid to the rebels, North said
he was told ``in so many words'' he was responsible for the
Contras. North said he kept Poindexter fully informed of his work
to help buy and ship arms to the rebels.
   North reluctantly admitted he supervised the arms-supply
operation put together by retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.
Secord.
   ``At no time, as you were running your operation, you never
tried to conceal or hide what you were doing from either Admiral
Poindexter or Robert McFarlane?'' Webb asked, the second reference
being to Poindexter's predecessor.
   ``I did not,'' North said.
   ``Were you ever trying to direct that operation on you own,
independent of your superiors?'' Webb asked.
   ``Never,'' North replied.
   ``Didn't you keep them apprised of all of your Contra-related
activities?'' Webb asked.
   ``Yes,'' North said.
   Poindexter, who succeeded McFarlane in late 1985, is charged
with conspiracy, two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts
of making false statements. The charges concern accusations that he
tried to cover up North's military assistance and fund raising for
the Contras as well as White House knowledge of a 1985 shipment of
Hawk missiles to Iran.
   One obstruction of Congress count relates to Poindexter's
assurances in July 21, 1986 letters to three legislative committees
that his staff was ``in compliance with the spirit and letter'' of
the law restricting Contra aid.
   It was sent two months after North warned Poindexter in a memo
that the secret operation was becoming more ``visible'' to curious
lawmakers with the infusion of $6 million in profits from the U.S.
arms sales to Iran.
   North testified that Poindexter, while he was McFarlane's
deputy, was among those who told him to work to provide assistance
to the Nicaraguan Contras as Congress was shutting off direct U.S.
military aid.
   Poindexter ``told you you were becoming the person who would
replace the CIA'' as the source of military support for the
Contras? he was asked.
   ``I don't want to put those words in his mouth,'' North said,
but ``in that general time frame he was one of the persons.''
   ``You were told, were you not, that you were supposed to go fund
and arm the Contras?'' Webb asked.
   ``In so many words, yes,'' North said. But he disputed Webb's
suggestion that he set up an ``enterprise'' with Secord and others
to buy and ship arms to the Contras.
   ``It began as something small, it evolved over time,'' North
said.
   Webb asked North if he could recall the late CIA Director
William Casey telling him ``the ball is in your hands'' after
Congress shut off funds for the rebels.
   ``In words to that effect,'' North replied.
   North, earlier convicted of aiding and abetting the obstruction
of Congress and destroying or altering key Iran-Contra documents,
testified under a grant of immunity from prosecution.
   But the former Marine was clearly uncomfortable taking the
witness stand against his former boss, frequently professing
ignorance or forgetfulness of conversations with Poindexter and of
key points from testimony North had previously given.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene frequently overruled defense
objections that the prosecutor was asking the witness leading
questions, calling North a ``hostile witness'' trying to be loyal
to Poindexter.
   Webb repeatedly produced sworn testimony that North had given in
the past that he gave orders to Secord, directing the resupply
operation from the White House.
   North initially resisted the suggestion he was directly in
charge, saying, ``Under my direction would be saying a major
general worked for a lieutenant colonel _ I don't think that's
correct.''
   But when confronted with his own words from a transcript, North
admitted that during his trial last year, he said he gave Secord
orders and ran the operation from Washington.
   ``Did you give him direction and guidance?'' Webb said.
   ``I gave him a lot of requests, if you want to call it direction
and guidance, I guess that's what we're stuck with,'' North said.

<HEAD>U.S., Soviets Working to Get Emergency Food Into Ethiopia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY CHENAULT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Soviet Union have
joined forces to try to get emergency food supplies into Ethiopia,
where up to 5 million people are in danger of starvation, a U.S.
lawmaker said Friday.
   Thomas Foglietta, D-Pa., said U.S. and Soviet officials are
pressuring leaders of two rebel movements in northern Ethiopia and
the Marxist-government to allow safe passage of relief supplies.
   ``There is action, a cooperative action between the Soviet Union
and the United States of America to get this accomplished,''
Foglietta said at a news conference. ``There has been some movement
along those lines.''
   He said he could not provide details of the joint efforts,
calling them ``extremely secretive and classified.''
   Earlier Friday, Foglietta and Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., met with
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to press for
increased international help to provide famine relief in Ethiopia.
   ``We are very concerned that the people of Ethiopia face their
third famine in seven years,'' Foglietta said. ``Five million
people are at risk of starvation. But they will not just die of
hunger; they will die because of politics unless we can persuade
the warring parties to let the food through.''
   Dorgan said, ``We will see dire consequences unless somehow the
international community is mobilized to say to those fighting in
that region and to say to others who are capable of helping that we
cannot allow this kind of tragedy to happen in the world.''
   Foglietta said Ethiopian President Mengistu Haile Mariam is
``reluctant to give too much leeway into the situation, fearing
that it would hurt him militarily.''
   ``So that's what we have. We have a conflict between the
military interest between these various groups and the humanitarian
interest that we have,'' he said.
   Foglietta said Ethiopians have started to migrate because there
is no food available in some areas. Relief agencies try to prevent
mass migrations because it adds to the hardships for
famine-stricken people and makes it more difficult to reach them if
arrangements are made for shipments into the troubled areas.
   Rebels in the northern Ethiopian provinces of Eritrea and Tigre
seeking autonomy have been fighting the Marxist government in Addis
Ababa for years.
   In 1984-85, up to 1 million people starved to death in Tigre and
Eritrea; in 1987-88, a massive international relief operation
prevented a similar tragedy during another crop failure.
   The U.S. Agency for International Development, the foreign aid
branch of the State Department, has estimated 750,000 metric tons
of emergency food are needed in Ethiopia this year.

   Two small planes, one trailing an
advertising banner, collided and crashed into a residential
neighborhood during rush-hour traffic Friday. All three people in
the two planes were killed, a federal official said.
   The planes crashed into homes about a block apart in this Fort
Lauderdale suburb, but there were no reports of injuries to anyone
on the ground, Miramar police officer Grace Cooper said.
   Fire trucks doused the wreckage to prevent explosions and police
sealed off several streets in the neighborhood.
   The collision occurred at an altitude of 900 to 1,000 feet near
North Perry Airport, but it was unclear how it happened,
authorities said.
   Jack Barker, spokesman for the southern region of the Federal
Aviation Administration in Atlanta, said a Cessna 152 flying
westbound southeast of the airport struck a Piper Super Cub coming
from the southeast at 4:35 p.m. EST.
   The pilot of the Super Cub and both people aboard the Cessna
died, Barker said.
   Witnesses said the Cessna apparently carried a student pilot and
trainer, while the other plane trailed a banner.
   The accident is under investigation by the National
Transportation Safety Board, Barker said.
   It was the latest of several fatal plane accidents in recent
years at North Perry Airport, which serves small planes in the
neighboring city of Pembroke Pines.
   ``North Perry's a very busy training airport,'' Barker said.
   Resident Marcy Crawford said she was driving home when she saw
the two planes out of the corner of her eye, at first thinking they
were birds.
   ``But I looked closer and I saw one falling off to the right ...
and the one plane spiral down like in slow motion and above it, a
banner just floating down,'' she said.
   Michael Hentz, a photographer for the Key West Citizen, was
driving on the nearby Florida Turnpike when he saw one plane crash.
   ``It like dropped out of the sky,'' Hentz said.
   The photographer said he thought he saw a body fly out, and
another body inside the plane, which he found ``buried into the
house'' when he drove to the scene.
   Scott Harrison, a resident of the neighborhood, said there was a
body on the roof of the house.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of police backed by U.S.
troops swept through Panama City on Friday, confiscating firearms
and drugs, and arresting suspects to stamp out a crime wave.
   Vice Minister of Government and Justice Ramon Lima said 760
people were arrested during the sweep, which was launched at dawn.
But he said the raids were not as successful as hoped.
   ``We did not confiscate the amount of weapons we had expected,''
Lima said in a news conference. He said police confiscated 47
shotguns, pistols and revolvers but no military weapons.
   Undisclosed amounts of cocaine, marijuana and crack also were
confiscated, he said.
   Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon, who is also the justice
minister, said the suspected drug dealers, illegal aliens and other
fugitives were taken to Federal Judicial Police headquarters, which
was surrounded by U.S. armored cars.
   Arias said the suspected drug dealers, illegal aliens and other
fugitives were taken to Federal Judicial Police headquarters, which
was surrounded by U.S. armored cars.
   William Ormsbee, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command, said
about 260 American soldiers were deployed ``in support of the
Panamanian police.'' About 400 Panamanian law enforcement officers
took part in the operation.
   The United States has 12,000 troops stationed in the area to
protect the Panama Canal, down from about 28,000 on Dec. 20, when
the United States invaded to oust dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Noriega was flown to Miami, where he is being held for trial on
drug trafficking and money-laundering charges. Noriega's Panamanian
Defense Forces, which included police and other law enforcement
agencies, was disbanded after the invasion.
   The new administration of President Guillermo Endara has been
shying away from establishing a military organization but has been
slowly building a police force.
   The new police force, which includes some elements from the old
Defense Forces, has been having a hard time combatting a growing
crime wave in the capital since the invasion.
   Arias said the sweep began at dawn, with the troops cordoning
off the tough neighborhoods of Curundu, Viejo Veranillo and
Brooklincito near the Panama Canal with barbed wire barricades. Two
hovering helicopters located people trying to flee.
   Police and American soldiers in battle fatigues followed up,
backed by armored personnel carriers, combed the area house to
house, Arias said. He said there were no casualties in the
operation.
   Residents in Curundu said they heard some shooting. Five
busloads of suspects were seen leaving the neighborhoods.
   Lima said there apparently had been a leak about the raid, which
began at 6 a.m. Residents said many people began leaving the
neighborhoods before 5 a.m.
   Jose Maria Infanzon, a fugitive also known as ``Half Moon,'' was
among those arrested Friday, together with two of 76 inmates who
had escaped from the national women's prison, Arias said.
   Infanzon was wanted on three charges of murder and four of
assault and battery.
   Arias said the operation was launched when people in the
neighborhoods opened fire on law enforcement officers earlier in
the week, wounding two police.
   Several vehicles heading for the canal area also were fired
upon, including some belonging to canal employees.
   Arias said the illegal aliens will be deported, and the
operation will continue until the crime wave subsides.

<HEAD>Florida School Flooded With Calls About Scholarships</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small university that announced it had
enough money to offer scholarships to black freshmen was flooded
with calls from far more students than it can serve, school
officials said Friday.
   Florida Atlantic University officials said they were having
trouble explaining to callers from across the country that they
planned to expand the tuition aid program to just 45 spots in the
fall, up from 30 last year.
   ``We got a mass of calls from people who said they are angry,''
said James Spear, executive assistant to Anthony Catanese,
president of the state university.
   A news report, which was carried by The Associated Press on
Thursday, said all the black freshmen who met admission standards
at FAU would be offered free tuition.
   The report did not note the number of scholarships available,
but in it officials spoke of expanding the program and seeking
donations from the community if demand surpassed expectations.
   Spear says the school probably could have met the goal of giving
all black freshmen scholarships this fall, based on earlier numbers
of black applications for scholarships.
   But the 11,500-student school cannot take an endless line of
applicants who might respond after their program got national
notice, Spear said.
   The $1,350 scholarship covers tuition and fees, but doesn't pay
for housing, books and other expenses.
   Out-of-state students can apply, but Florida residents get
preference under the program, which will be financed with school
funds and private donations.
   Based on the number of scholarships awarded last year, and the
number of black freshmen expected, officials believed there was
plenty of money so every every qualified black applicant to get a
scholarship, Spear said.
   ``It's almost a Catch-22,'' Spear said. ``We offered 30 Martin
Luther King scholarships last year as a part of our overall
scholarship programs. We had 28 (black freshmen) apply who met our
admission standards.''
   He said the school is doing the best it can to attract and hold
the top high school graduates from south Florida.
   Officials were shocked when they started getting calls from as
far away as Denver and Toronto. Some callers wanted to apply, but
others were angry.
   ``One caller said: `I'm black and my wife is white, does that
mean we pay 50 percent?' '' Spear said.
   On the bright side, Spear noted the attention could attract some
bright students from outside the area.
   Said the spokesman: ``We got a million-dollar PR campaign.''

<HEAD>Residents Blast Group's Charge: Street's Italian Colors Promote
Racism</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A neighborhood that paints a street's
divider stripes red, white and green in tribute to the Italian flag
is promoting ethnic bias and exacerbating racial tensions, a
minority group charges.
   ``It causes racial unrest because it depicts territory,'' said
Kathie Townsend-Hurk of the Martin Luther King Coalition Against
Racism, a group formed after a December attack on a Hispanic family
in Federal Hill. ``They claim the neighborhood to be theirs.''
   Residents don't buy that.
   ``This is an Italian neighborhood. We're not racist. The line,
it's a tradition,'' said Angelo Quaranto as he stacked bags of
macaroni in Anthony's Fruit and Vegetables. ``They do something in
their neighborhood, you think we'd protest?''
   The stripes along Atwells Avenue were first painted in Italy's
national colors a decade ago for a Columbus Day parade and the
annual St. Joseph's Day Festival. The tradition continues, at city
expense.
   ``They come in and want to take our colors off the street?
That's ridiculous, that's bull,'' said Loretta Scivola. ``They come
here and they want everything. I think they're just looking for
something to complain about.''
   ``You look at the stripes and you're automatically
intimidated,'' responded coalition member Holgar Streu. ``Why not
put up flags on the day of the festival? Why do they have to leave
the stripes all year?''
   In a message to Mayor Joseph R. Paolino Jr. two weeks ago, the
coalition demanded the divider stripes be scrubbed off.
   But the mayor, a Federal Hill resident, says the stripe-painting
tradition ``makes Providence the great city it is. They should
realize the intent of the pride that the Italians have in the
neighborhood.''
   Paolino, a likely Democratic candidate for governor this year,
said a cut in state aid to cities and towns forced him to cut
Providence's street-painting budget. He said the city was looking
for a private group to finance a new paint job for the dividing
line this May.
   ``I don't think it causes any racial tension,'' said Jason Wong,
a Chinese immigrant who manages Chef Ho's Chinese Restaurant.
``This area is mostly Italian. It represents a tradition.''
   The city hires a private company every two years to repaint the
stripes for $2,000. Irene Testa, director of Providence's
Department of Engineering, said the Italian colors aren't unique in
the city.
   Smith Street is decorated with a green stripe for St. Patrick's
Day; Laurel Hill and Union avenues in the Silver Lake area are
painted with Italian colors for the St. Bartholomew's Feast; the
center lines on Branch Avenue and Charles Street are painted green,
white and red for St. Ann's festival; and the line on Wickendon
Street in Fox Point once was painted blue and white to celebrate a
Portuguese festival.
   The dispute ``is just going to alienate people who want to
help'' combat racism, said Joseph DeGiulio, president of the
Federal Hill Merchants Association. ``It will cause unnecessary
strife. This street belongs to everybody, but you've got to be
proud of where you came from.''

   An aspiring tennis pro headed home
from a tournament in Israel on Friday to face charges that he and
his brother shot their millionaire parents to death, friends and
relatives said.
   Erik Menendez, 19, who with his brother is heir to a $14 million
estate, left a house in a Tel Aviv suburb Friday morning, saying he
was going to Ben-Gurion International Airport, said his Israeli
host, who asked not to be identified.
   His 22-year-old brother, Lyle, was arrested Thursday and held
without bail. He was expected to be arraigned Monday on murder
charges, with ``special circumstance'' counts that potentially
carry the death penalty, district attorney's spokeswoman Sandi
Gibbons said.
   Erik will be arraigned on identical charges if he returns or is
captured, Ms. Gibbons said.
   Jose Menendez, 45, and his wife Mary Louise ``Kitty'' Menendez,
44, were slain Aug. 20 in their $5 million Spanish-style Beverly
Hills mansion.
   In another development Friday, the Los Angeles Times reported
that Erik Menendez once co-wrote a screenplay with a high school
buddy about a pampered 18-year-old who murders his rich parents and
three other people.
   The boys had reported finding the bodies after returning from a
night out. The slayings were so bloody, and clues so scarce, that
many in Hollywood believed they were ``message'' murders by
mobsters Menendez had crossed in the course of his business.
   An uncle, Carlos Baralt, said the family finds it inconceivable
the sons could have killed their parents. He said he spoke briefly
by phone with Erik on Thursday. ``I think what he would like to do
is be permitted to present himself, rather than be arrested and be
brought in in chains.''
   Menendez, a Cuban who fled the Castro regime with little money,
wound up the chairman of Live Entertainment, a video distributor
and retailer affiliated with Carolco Pictures. Carolco is
best-known for the ``Rambo'' movies.
   Friends, including former California Lt. Gov. Mike Curb, said
Menendez made it to top jobs at RCA, Hertz and Live through
tenacity and aggressiveness that sometimes rubbed people the wrong
way,
   His sons shared his good looks and self-confidence, but had it
easier. They grew up loving the good life, attending a private
school in New Jersey, touring the amateur tennis circuit. Lyle
attended Princeton University, bought a condominium near the
campus, and dreamed of owning a string of restaurants.
   Eric co-wrote a 66-page screenplay two years ago that opens with
the 18-year-old protagonist, Hamilton Cromwell, reading a will that
bestows $157 million on him. ``Hamilton smiles sadistically,'' the
script states.
   Cromwell's five victims are found frozen in a basement, after
which a friend shoots Cromwell to death. Cromwell's tape-recorded
voice is played later at a trial: ``You must understand ... that
the price a player pays for failure in the game of life is death.''
   Beverly Hills Police Chief Marvin D. Iannone said Thursday that
detectives had circumstantial evidence against the sons early on in
the investigation. He said the seven-month investigation uncovered
physical evidence that showed the sons were the trigger men.
   The family had been undergoing counseling, and a key break came
Thursday with the seizure of records of the psychologist. Such
seizures are allowed only rarely under California law protecting
patient-therapist relationships.
   Lyle Menendez's lawyer, Gerald Chaleff, said he would probably
object strongly to the search, although he hadn't seen the
paperwork justifying the warrants. Chaleff also said he expects
Erik to turn himself in.
   Under terms of the parents' wills, made nine years ago, the sons
were to share the estate if both parents died at the same time. A
$400,000 life insurance policy already has been distributed to them.

   The State Department warned Americans Friday
night to avoid Indian Airlines flights to the capital of the state
of Jammu-Kashmir in northern India because of the possibility of
terrorist attacks.
   The department's statement said the warning was based on the
appearance of posters in the area that warned people not to take
the Indian Airlines flights to Srinagar.
   In January the State Department advised U.S. citizens to
postpone unnecessary travel to the area because of political unrest.
   At least 173 people have been killed and hundreds were injured
in violence that followed a government crackdown Jan. 20 on Moslem
militants seeking Independence.

<TEXT>
   A group that won federal approval of tests
for a potential AIDS drug made from a Chinese plant has received a
$250,000 grant from a pharmaceutical giant, officials announced
Friday.
   The grant for further study of Compound Q came from Sandoz,
U.S.A., a company based in Hanover, N.J, officials of Project
Inform told a news conference.
   But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's decision to allow
testing of a purified form of the drug, confirmed by an FDA source
Thursday, was criticized by Dr. Donald Abrams, a member of the
FDA's antiviral drugs advisory committee.
   ``I'm thinking of resigning from the committee,'' said Abrams,
the assistant AIDS director at San Francisco General Hospital. He
called the group's original, underground study ``unorthodox'' and
said he was ``concerned about safety.''
   A group of doctors organized by Project Inform nine months ago
started their own study without FDA approval in an effort to
determine if the drug was effective in battling the AIDS virus once
it infected the body.
   The group smuggled the drug trichosanthin, made from a
cucumber-like plant, from China and administered it to about 60
people in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and Miami.
   The group's leaders claimed they couldn't wait for the
government stamp of approval, saying AIDS patients were desperate
and already were experimenting with the drug.
   Project Inform's co-director, Martin Delaney, said the new study
would involve GLQ-223, a Compound Q drug made by GeneLabs, a small
private company in Redwood City, Calif.
   Delaney said the American drug and the one from China were
``pharmaceutically identical.''
   However, he said using the GeneLab product would allow
researchers improved quality control. He added that controls were
more than adequate at the plant in Shanghai, but there was a
possibility it could be harmed in transit.
   The new study will administer GLQ-223 to about 100 patients
recruited in the same cities where the underground test was held.
   ``The original Compound Q program effectively determined the
basic safety profile of this drug in record time and has provided
the only public information to date about the effects of the
drug,'' said Delaney.
   Delaney and Terry Beswick, an administrator of the study, said
critics of the FDA action were ``taking potshots'' and forming
opinions without knowing all the facts.

<HEAD>Witness: Hazelwood's Actions Proper in Hours Before Spill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former tanker captain said Friday
that Joseph Hazelwood gave a virtuoso performance commanding the
Exxon Valdez in the hours before the tanker struck a reef and
unleashed the nation's worst oil spill.
   Hazelwood ``set everything up beautifully'' before leaving the
bridge under the control a third mate to do some paperwork, the
former captain, Shiras Walker, testified at Hazelwood's criminal
trial.
   Walker, testifying for the defense, suggested there shouldn't
have been any problem clearing jagged Bligh Reef if Hazelwood's
orders to make a turn had been carried out.
   ``It was a very gentle turn,'' Walker said. ``He had plenty of
sea room.''
   Questioned further on the central issue on Hazelwood's criminal
trial, the witness said: ``He left proper instructions with his
mate. He gave a lawful command to the third mate to call him when
he made the turn. That was Capt. Hazelwood's check to make sure the
turn was made.''
   Walker noted that the third mate did as he was told and called
the captain.
   ``What would a call like that tell you?'' asked attorney Michael
Chalos.
   ``It would put me at ease,'' said Walker, who noted that the
turn order given to the helmsman was ``a very simple thing. It's
even easier than steering some cars.''
   After the ship grounded on the reef March 24, spilling almost 11
million gallons of Alaska crude oil into Prince William Sound,
Hazelwood continued to act properly, Walker testified.
   ``I would have done exactly what Capt. Hazelwood did,'' Walker
said, crediting Hazelwood with thinking more clearly than he would
have expected after a grounding.
   ``I've been through groundings,'' Walker said. ``The feeling is
equivalent to being punched in the stomach. And I'm talking about a
one-to-two barrel spill, not something of this magnitude. To bear
up under that _ it's amazing.''
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is charged with one felony
count of criminal mischief, and misdemeanor counts of reckless
endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent
discharge of oil. He faces up to 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in
fines if convicted on all charges.
   In an unexplained development Friday, Superior Court Judge Karl
Johnstone dismissed a woman juror and replaced her with a male
alternate during a secret session with lawyers for both sides that
lasted nearly an hour.
   Johnstone refused to disclose why the juror had been excused,
telling reporters only, ``I released a juror,'' and, ``It's not a
big deal.''
   Walker testified that Hazelwood did nothing unusual in boarding
his ship just 45 minutes before departure.
   As for Hazelwood's decision to go below while a local pilot
guided the ship through the Valdez Narrows, Walker said that, too,
was routine.
   ``On most of the ships I pilot, the captain is below,'' Walker
said. ``I find no fault there. There are no regulations on where he
has to be. He could be anywhere he wants to be.''
   Walker said when he was in command of tankers in the Valdez
area, he operated under the belief the Coast Guard monitored his
movements from its Traffic Control Center there.
   ``They spent $70 million to build that place to warn you of
collisions and groundings.'' Walker said.
   He indicated that if there was ice in the area and a ship left
the normal traffic lanes, he believed the Coast Guard would monitor
even more closely than normal.

<HEAD>Metal From Rebel Weapons Melted for Peace Monument</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers on Friday melted down metal from
weapons of a disarmed guerrilla group to forge a monument to peace.
   The leftist April 19 Movement, or M19, handed over its firearms
Thursday and pledged to join the political system as a party. It
was the first guerrilla group to accept peace offers from President
Virgilio Barco's government.
   M19 leader Carlos Pizarro, a candidate for mayor of Bogota in
Sunday's municipal and congressional elections, said in the
southern town of Santo Domingo that the disarmament had helped free
the country from ``the specter of civil war.'' He said he was sorry
other leftist guerrilla groups have not accepted the government
peace plan.
   Political analysts say Pizarro has no chance of winning the
mayor's race. But government sources say he may act as an
intermediary in future peace talks with other rebel groups.
   Meanwhile in Caloto, 185 miles southwest of Bogota, at a
ceremony marking the peace accord, Interior Minister Carlos Lemos
said, ``I have participated in a historic moment that creates the
possibility for long-awaited peace in Colombia.''
   The M19 turned over 511 weapons Thursday to an international
committee in Santo Domingo and Vergel, another southern town, a
government statement said.
   M19's estimated 1,800 members laid down their arms in exchange
for a government amnesty for crimes committed by members during 16
years of insurgency.
   The group mounted some of Colombia's most daring rebel attacks.
Its members took hostage the U.S. ambassador and 15 other envoys in
1980 and captured the Palace of Justice in a 1985 assault that left
115 people dead, including 11 Supreme Court justices.
   The group's weapons _ submachine guns, rifles, shotguns and
pistols _ were melted down Friday in an industrial furnace in Cali,
said Morris Armitache, the smelter in charge of the process. He
said in a radio broadcast that the government had told him to save
the nearly 3,000 pounds of iron to make a peace monument.
   There were no details on what the monument would be.
   Two other rebel groups, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia and the People's Liberation Army, have continued attacking
police and military targets, despite offering to negotiate with the
government.
   Another group, the National Liberation Army, has said it will
never accept official peace talks. It has carried out a campaign of
kidnappings and other terrorism to disrupt Sunday's balloting.

<HEAD>Minorities to Have Greater Role in New Romanian Parliament</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Council of National Unity voted
Friday to increase ethnic minority representation in Romania's
first freely elected parliament since 1937, while restricting the
role of the military.
   The council, the makeshift parliament running the country until
elections, debated the draft electoral law governing the May 20
elections for a 331-seat two-chamber parliament.
   Debate was at times boisterous in the vaulted neo-classical
amphitheater where dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's rubber-stamp
National Assembly once met.
   Ceausescu was ousted and then executed last December in the wave
of reforms that washed over Eastern Europe.
   ``We have to put an end to this provisional stage we are in,''
interim President Ion Iliescu said Friday in response to calls to
delay any vote on the electoral law until a new constitution is
promulgated.
   The constitution is to be worked out by the new parliament.
   The draft electoral law provides for the military high command
to fill by appointment 15 seats in the new parliament, in
recognition of the military's role in supporting the revolution.
   But council members voted by a show of hands to confine the
military seats to the weaker lower house of Parliament, the
Assembly of Deputies, and exclude them from the Senate.
   The draft law had provided for parliamentary representation only
for ethnic minorities able to garner 20,000 votes, but the council
voted to set aside seats for the 13 officially recognized ethnic
groups, the largest being the Hungarians and Germans.
   Council member Varujan Vosgarian, a member of the Armenian
minority, said in appealing for broader minority representation,
``We were about 100,000. We lived in Romania for many centuries.
After the dictatorship, only 7,000 remained. If you don't vote for
us to get a seat, that means that you deny our role as martyrs.''
   Much of the nation's Armenian population perished in Stalinist
labor camps after World War II.
   The draft law provides for a mixture of direct election of
candidates and proportional representation to reflect geographical
regions as well as the more than 50 parties.
   Most of them are small groupings that have sprung up in the
aftermath of the December revolution, which ended Ceausescu's
24-year Stalinist rule.
   Earlier Friday, Prime Minister Petre Roman predicted it will
take five years to completely unravel Romania's Communist-imposed
centralized economy and convert to a modern free market system.
   He outlined the provisional government's recovery plan for an
economy that has been starved of already relatively scarce consumer
goods since 1980, when Ceausescu began a huge export program to pay
off Romania's national debt and finance his own grandiose
construction schemes.
   The state-run economy is still reeling from a drain on
resources. The most basic consumer goods, such as fruit and
underwear, usually are available only on the black market.
   A new law went into effect Thursday to promote free enterprise
by allowing the establishment of private companies with up to 20
employees. Roman proposed raising the employee limit to 100.
   Roman said his interim government will maintain the freeze on
basic commodity prices to avoid economic dislocation, but prices of
unprocessed agricultural products should be allowed to float freely.
   He said that in an effort to boost agriculture, the export of
chemical fertilizers has been halted and the government has started
to distribute pesticides, not available to farmers in the last
years of Ceausescu's rule.

   The Vermont Supreme Court has upheld the
1988 drug conviction of John Zaccaro Jr., the son of former vice
presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro.
   In a unanimous decision released Friday, the court rejected
claims by Zaccaro's attorneys that his conviction for possessing
and selling cocaine should be reversed. The justices rejected
arguments that, among other things, the 1986 undercover police
operation was conducted illegally and Zaccaro was the victim of
selective prosecution because of his mother's fame.
   ``While the officers involved acknowledged awareness of the fact
that defendant is the son of a public figure, there is no
indication that this was a motivating factor in the state's
decision to prosecute defendant,'' Associate Justice Ernest W.
Gibson wrote in the decision.
   Vermont Attorney General Jeffrey Amestoy said he was pleased
with the court's decision.
   ``What you had here was somebody intending to sell drugs who got
caught,'' Amestoy said. ``It's clear from the court's opinion that
the legal arguments of the defendant were without bearing.''
   Kathleen Sullivan, a Harvard Law School professor who
represented Zaccaro during the appeal, said the main issue in the
appeal was the entry into Zaccaro's home by an undercover state
trooper.
   ``We're very disappointed that the Vermont Supreme Court didn't
realize the importance of protecting the home from undercover
searches,'' Sullivan said. ``This is something that affects all the
citizens of the state of Vermont.''
   Sullivan also disagreed with the court's ruling on the selective
prosecution issue.
   ``We all know that John Zaccaro would have been in less trouble
if he had not been the son of a famous lady,'' Sullivan said.
   Sullivan said the family had not yet determined whether further
legal action will be taken.
   Zaccaro, then a student at Middlebury College, was arrested Feb.
20, 1986, at his Middlebury home after selling $25 worth of cocaine
to an undercover Vermont State Trooper. The trooper, a woman, had
been invited into Zaccaro's home by his roommate.
   Zaccaro was convicted of possession and sale of a regulated drug
in April 1988 and sentenced to one-to-five years in prison.
   In claiming that he was the victim of selective prosecution,
Zaccaro said other Middlebury College students had been caught
using cocaine but had not been prosecuted. Testimony revealed that
those students had been caught by Middlebury College authorities
who did not release the information to police.
   ``Defendant here has failed to meet his burden of showing that
others who were similarly situated were not prosecuted,'' the
justices said.
   The court also denied Zaccaro's claims that his right to a fair
trial was violated when the district court allowed testimony based
on suppressed evidence, and that the judge's instructions to the
jury on entrapment were erroneous.
   Zaccaro actually served three months under house arrest. The
sentence was criticized when it became known Zaccaro was serving
the sentence in a $1,500-a-month Burlington apartment with maid
service.
   Zaccaro also completed more than 500 hours of community service
by working at the King Street Youth Center for troubled youth.
   His mother was the 1984 Democratic vice-presidential nominee.

   Patrick Keegan, a leading Roman Catholic layman,
died in the western city of Bristol on Thursday. He was 74.
   The church's information office said he died in a hospital after
a short illness, but it gave no cause of death.
   Keegan, a social worker, was the first layman to address a
plenary session at a church council.
   He was a founding member of the Young Christian Workers movement
in 1937 and helped prepare international lay congresses in Rome for
the Second Vatican Council in 1962-1965, where he was a lay auditor.
   He spoke to the council on the role of the laity in the church.
The late Pope Paul VI later appointed him to the Vatican Council
for Laity.
   There was no information on survivors or funeral arrangements.

   John McCarthy, a British television reporter
abducted in Lebanon, will be awarded the Institute of Journalists'
gold medal on the fourth anniversary of his disappearance, the news
union announced Thursday.
   The medal recognizes ``journalists who have been prepared to
suffer for the freedom of the written word and whose courage and
devotion has been eminently inspiring,'' the union said in a
statement.
   No group has claimed responsibility for the abduction of
McCarthy on April 17, 1986.
   The 33-year-old journalist for the London-based Worldwide
Television news agency is one of 18 Westerners, including eight
Americans, missing in Lebanon. Most are believed held hostage by
pro-Iranian Moslem extremists.
   Longest held is Terry Anderson, the Middle East correspondent
for AP, abducted nearly five years ago from a Beirut street.
   McCarthy's father, Patrick, was expected to receive the medal on
his son's behalf April 17 at a special service in St. Bride's
Church in London's Fleet Street.

   A boy who was beaten and set on fire because he
refused a neighborhood bully's order to take drugs underwent
several hours of surgery Friday, hospital officials said.
   One day after his 12th birthday, David Opont underwent a
four-hour operation to graft a thin layer of skin from his lower
legs onto his badly burned arms.
   Dr. Cleon Goodwin, director of the burn center at New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, said David did well during the
operation but would need several skin-grafting operations; 55
percent of his body was burned.
   ``I would still like to stress he is in a life-threatening
situation and will be for the next several months,'' Goodwin said
at a news conference.
   The boy's condition will be evaluated further Saturday, Goodwin
said, adding that a infection is a major risk.
   Head Nurse Barbara Both said David was ``thrilled to pieces that
President Reagan'' had called to wish him well.
   The former president, the White House and Mayor David Dinkins
were among those who sent cards, gifts, balloons, flowers and
messages.
   ``He is a very warm, loving, trusting child,'' Ms. Both said.
``David is in this big city of ours and is an innocent child.''
   The boy sleeps a lot she said, adding, ``He doesn't seem to be
in a great deal of pain between the medication and his spirit.''
   Despite the attack, David's parents have don't regret coming to
the United States, from their native Port-au-Prince, Haiti, 18
months ago, said Guito Lavoile, a cousin who said he spoke for the
family.
   The family spelled their name Aupont in Haiti but changed it to
Opont when they emigrated, said Lavoile. The earlier spelling has
been used by authorities since the attack.
   A 13-year-old boy described as an occasionally vicious bully who
also is a troubled foster child with learning disabilities was
arrested in the attack.
   The suspect, unidentified because of his age, is charged with
second-degree attempted murder, first-degree assault, second-degree
kidnapping, robbery and attempted robbery.
   The alleged attacker is big for his age, appearing to be 17 or
18, police said. He was held pending arraignment Monday in Family
Court.
   The suspect intimidated and beat up smaller children, a young
neighbor said, and himself was scorned by older youths whose
company he coveted.
   ``They think he's strange,'' said the neighbor, Lisa Paulycarpe,
14, who lives on the suspect's block.
   ``He's an outcast. He wants to be in, but people say, `We don't
want to hang with you.'''
   On Wednesday, the suspect accosted five boys including David on
their way to school, according to Detective Joseph McConville. Two
of the boys fled and the suspect ransacked the pockets of the
remaining three.
   He then took David five blocks to the basement of an abandoned
apartment building.
   The youth told David that if he refused to use crack, he would
be set aflame, according to McConville.
   David, his hands tied behind his back, was beaten with a
baseball bat, soaked with gasoline and set on fire while tied to a
sewer pipe, authorities said.
   David, a sixth-grader, is ``a normal kid. He got along with
(other) kids,'' said his step-brother, Rudy LeBrun.

   The head of the Federal Aviation
Administration lifted the licenses Friday of three Northwest
Airlines crew members accused of flying under the influence of
alcohol.
   The three were arrested when their Boeing 727 with 91 passengers
aboard arrived in Minneapolis from Fargo, N.D. on Thursday.
   James Busey, administrator of the FAA, said in a statement
announcing the emergency revocation of the licenses of the pilot,
co-pilot and second officer that ``we will take equally forceful
action against any other airman who violates the agency's
regulations against alcohol.''
   ``Safety and alcohol do not mix,'' Busey said.
   Violations of the agency's alcohol rules ``is not common at
all,'' said FAA spokesman Bob Buckhorn. He said he could not
remember the last instance.
   Buckhorn said Busey acted after the three crew members were
reported by an FAA inspector to have been flying within eight hours
of drinking, being under the influence of alcohol and having blood
alcohol concentrations greater than 0.04 percent.
   The three have the right to appeal within 10 days to the
National Transportation Safety Board. Names of the three have not
been released.
   Bob Gibbons, spokesman for Northwest, said in Eagan, Minn. that
the airline was still conducting its own investigation to see
whether the crew had violated the company's rule against drinking
within 12 hours before a flight.
   ``The net effect (of the license revocations) is not awfully
significant because we withdrew them from flying yesterday,'' said
Gibbons.
   ``Upon the completion of our investigation they could be
subjected to discipline which could be as severe as discharge from
the company.''

<TEXT>
   Officials from the two Germanys met Friday to
prepare for international talks that will plot a course for
reunification while trying to overcome problems rooted in decades
of distrust.
   The private meeting was the first stage of negotiations that
ultimately are to involve leaders from East and West Germany and
the four victorious World War II Allies _ the United States, Soviet
Union, Britain and France.
   Ernst Krabatsch, East Germany's deputy foreign minister, met
with Dieter Kastrup, head of the political department at West
Germany's Foreign Ministry, for 2{ hours at a Foreign Ministry
villa in a suburb of East Berlin.
   The two said they discussed procedural questions for talks
planned Wednesday in Bonn, where German officials will begin laying
the groundwork for reunification. They said they had pledged to
keep details of the talks secret and refused to comment further.
   Under the formula agreed to last month, the two German nations
will first discuss the domestic aspects of unification before
consulting with the Allies about security issues.
   The Allies have given their blessing to the idea of German
unification, but enormous problems need to be worked out _ in
particular, the Soviet Union's insistence that a united Germany not
be a member of NATO. In addition, Poland is insisting on a role in
the talks.
   The meeting in Bonn is slated to be low-level. No definite
results are expected to emerge until after elections March 18 in
East Germany, the first free elections in the nation's history.
   The official ADN news agency reported Friday that 24 political
parties will take part in the elections. It quoted election
commission spokeswoman Petra Blaess as saying the final roster
includes the Party for Democratic Socialism, which used to be the
Communist Party; the Social Democrats; the liberal Free Democrats;
and the Alliance for Germany, a conservative coalition backed by
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union.
   Smaller parties such as Alliance 90, the environmentalist
Greens, the independent Women's League and oddballs like the German
Beer Drinkers' Union were also accepted by the election commission.
   East Germany's voters will choose a new Parliament with 400
members, 100 fewer than the current People's Chamber.
   The leftist Social Democrats are favorites to win a majority,
but the three-party Alliance for Germany, boosted by campaign
appearances by Kohl and other West German conservatives, has jumped
from a 17 percent share of support to more than 30 percent in
recent opinion polls.
   However, the Alliance's chances could be hurt by accusations
that Wolfgang Schnur, a top candidate from the alliance's
Democratic Awakening party, was a long-time informer of the hated
state security police.
   Schnur denied the charges, made by a citizens' investigative
commission Thursday, and Alliance members Friday backed his claims
of innocence.
   But Karl-Ernst Eppler, Rostock chairman of Democratic Awakening,
recommended Friday that ``in the interests of the party,'' Schnur
should not be a candidate.
   The Communists, despite the name change and personal popularity
of interim Premier Hans Modrow, are expected to fare badly, with no
other left-leaning party willing to form a coalition with them.
   The elections will give the new government a popular mandate to
negotiate terms of unification with West Germany and the Allies.
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski of Poland and his premier, Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, met with French President Francois Mitterrand in Paris
on Friday to rally French backing for Poland's demands to
participate in the talks.
   Their demand is based on fears that a united Germany might try
to reclaim about a third of Poland that was German territory before
World War II.
   After Friday's talks, Mitterrand endorsed the Polish demand for
an accord fixing their border. But he stopped well short of calling
for a full place for Poland at the talks on reunification between
the Germanys and the four World War II allies.
   ``Poland cannot be in the six; that much is clear,'' he said at
a news conference. He added Warsaw's role would be ``beside, not
within'' the process.
   The two Poles initially said they were pleased with the Paris
discussions, but Mazowiecki later said only full representation in
the talks would soothe fears of his countrymen.
   ``It's not enough for us to be consulted but to take part in the
discussions,'' he said.
   West Germany's Parliament agreed Thursday that a united Germany
should honor Poland's present border, but it apparently has not
eased Poland's concerns.
   The two Germanys have formed the front between NATO and the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact alliances for more than 40 years, and a
united Germany would be a colossal country of more than 76 million
people in strategically important central Europe.
   Also Friday, East German Public Prosecutor Hans-Juergen Joseph
announced the release of former chief of the security police, Erich
Mielke, on grounds of ill health, ADN reported.
   Mielke was jailed Dec. 8 on charges of abusing public office,
along with other former Communist officials ousted in the fall
revolution. The charges against Mielke were later upped to include
high treason.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
on Friday raised the possibility of a major role for U.N. forces in
efforts to disarm the Nicaraguan rebels when he briefed the
Security Council on developments there.
   The private consultations focused on proposals to expand the
mandate for the U.N. Observer Group in Central America, U.N.
spokesman Juan Carlos Brandt said.
   The Security Council formed the 256-member observer group, known
as ONUCA, to verify the cutoff of aid to rebel movements and to
patrol borders to keep guerrillas from launching attacks from other
countries.
   Brandt said Perez de Cuellar will report to the 15-member
Security Council next week on the proposed heightened role for
ONUCA.
   ``The new mandate being discussed for ONUCA would have it play a
key role in disarming the Nicaraguan resistance forces, and
possibly their voluntary repatriation,'' he said. ``If the Security
Council decides to give ONUCA that responsibility, it would require
significant increases in personnel and other resources.''
   The U.S.-supported Nicaraguan rebels are known as Contras.
   Canadian Ambassador Yves Fortier said after Friday's
consultations that ``there are some encouraging signs'' from
Nicaragua.
   ``We're talking about the demobilization of the Contras, both
the men and equipment,'' Fortier said.
   He said events in Nicaragua ``are happening very rapidly.''
   ``There are lines of communication which are open. The
demobilization process under the supervision of the U.N. is going
forward.''
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has said armed citizens will
fight the rebels if they do not disband before President-elect
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro takes office on April 25. Mrs. Chamorro
defeated Ortega in presidential elections Feb. 25.
   The Contras have fought the Sandinista government since 1981,
and Ortega said they continue to launch attacks into Nicaragua from
camps in Honduras.
   Both Ortega and Mrs. Chamorro called for the Contras to disband
before the inauguration, but rebel leaders refused. They said she
must first take office and the new government be given control of
the Sandinista People's Army and the Interior Ministry forces.
   The uncertainty over disbanding creates questions over how
effective a U.N.-sponsored program to disarm the Contras will be
since it emphasizes the repatriation process is voluntary.
   ``From following reports from the region, one doesn't have a
clear idea of whether they will or will not demobilize,'' Brandt
said.

<HEAD>Auto Group Pleased With Car Seat Decision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consumer group Thursday hailed the
government's decision to investigate possible defects in a popular
child car seat as a vindication of its previous safety warnings.
   ``Now it's not only us who's saying there's a problem,'' said
Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety, which last
year said millions of defective child safety seats were being sold
and used despite government recalls.
   ``We're very pleased that they're opening the defect
investigation into what we said was the worst hazard,'' Ditlow said.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration this week
told the center it was opening ``a defect investigation'' into the
organization's allegation of a ``false latch condition'' in the
Onestep child seat made by Evenflo Corp. of Piqua, Ohio.
   In a ``false latch condition,'' a seat will appear latched when
checked with a tug, but will open in a crash, leaving the child
exposed to injury.
   ``We have no complaints or lawsuits involving the false latch of
the Onestep car seat,'' said Bob Potter, attorney for Evenflo's
baby products division, who confirmed the government action.
   In December 1989, the center filed a petition asking the agency
for an investigation and recall of the Onestep seat, which it said
had the highest injury and fatality rate in the industry.
   The center also said was failing to enforce the recalls it did
order.
   Evenflo tested the Onestep following the allegations in December
and ``concluded with great confidence that there was no problem,''
said Potter.
   The agency criticized the center for misleading the public and
said then that child safety seats were the ``single most effective
safety device ever developed for an automobile.''
   Federal auto safety officials did not return calls for comment
Thursday on the Onestep probe.

   Redoubt Volcano erupted again Friday,
shooting out a seven-mile-high plume of ash that drifted away from
population centers, officials said.
   ``There is nothing heading for the Anchorage area or the Kenai
Peninsula,'' a populated area near the volcano, said Cynthia
Gardner, a geologist at the Alaska Volcano Observatory.
   No ash was falling in the Drift River area, where fallout from
previous eruptions had hindered loading at an oil facility, she
said. Ash was moving to the north and northwest of the volcano, she
said.
   Seismologists at the Alaska Volcano Observatory said the
``moderate-size eruption'' at 9:51 a.m. contained less ash than
previous blasts, said observatory spokesman John Paskievitch.
   Scientists at the observatory were trying to determine if there
was any connection between the eruption and earthquakes that
occured in the same area Friday, Paskievitch said.
   A quake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale hit at 3:24 a.m. AST,
and seismologists said the quake was centered 50 miles beneath
Redoubt. Another quake, registering 5.2 and centered in the same
region, struck at 5:11 p.m..
   A third quake hit at 8:03 a.m. It was centered about 170 miles
southwest of Fairbanks and registered 5.5 on the Richter scale.
   Bobbi McGlashan, a spokeswoman at Anchorage International
Airport, said it was business as usual there.
   ``It's not doing anything to us,'' McGlashan said. ``No flights
have been diverted and none canceled.''
   On Feb. 28, the abrasive ash reached Anchorage, closing schools,
forcing precautionary evacuations at the Drift River Oil Terminal
and the Air Force to move its F-15 fighters into hangars Elmendorf
Air Force Base.
   Redoubt Volcano is 115 miles southwest of Anchorage.
   It erupted in mid-December after slumbering for 25 years. A
series of explosive eruptions around Christmas slowed or diverted
holiday air traffic and mail.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Soldiers fired on student
demonstrators Friday and wounded at least three, radio accounts and
witnesses said, and reports surfaced that negotiations had begun
for Haiti's military ruler to resign.
   State TV Friday night said Avril had met with Army and church
leaders to negotiate peace but had no intention of leaving power
unless he is defeated in elections _ `not through disorder.''
   The protest by about 250 students came on the fourth day of
anti-government protests over the army's killing of an 11-year-old
girl.
   Political sources said opposition parties were negotiating with
Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril and the army over his possible resignation
as leader of this impoverished Caribbean nation. ``Finally, after
four years of struggle, there is a real possibility to realize the
demands of Feb. 7, 1986'' _ the date dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier
fled into exile after a popular uprising, said Jean-Claude Bajeux,
a prominent political and human rights activist.
   A U.S. Embassy diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said
the United States was not involved in the talks.
   ``We are keeping in touch with them but we are in no way
involved with negotiations. We are not putting together a deal. It
is up to Haitians to decide if there's to be a change in
government,'' the diplomat said.
   A coalition of 11 opposition parties issued a statement Friday
calling on Haitians to stage ``an unlimited total paralysis of the
country'' if Avril does not step down by Monday.
   They said they proposed that Supreme Court Vice President
Gabriel Volcy act as provisional leader until elections are held.
The parties have repeatedly said they want Avril replaced for now
with a Supreme Court judge.
   Avril, who came to power in a soldiers' revolt in September
1988, has said he would be willing to step down if most Haitians
wanted him to, although he predicted that would lead to
``revolution and chaos.''
   But a high-ranking government official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Friday that Avril has no intention of resigning
soon.
   ``Avril is ready to make concessions, but a hasty departure is
out of the question,'' he said.
   Late Friday, a commentator on state National Television said,
``The president has said he would leave if the will of the people
demand it, but the people's will can only be expressed through
elections and not through disorder.
   ``The president has taken all the measures necessary to provide
for free elections,'' the commentator said on the 10 p.m. news,
adding that Avril has met with members of the Army high command and
the Roman Catholic and Protestant church to negotiate peace.
   Demonstrations broke out Friday in the outskirts of
Port-au-Prince and continued until sundown. Protesters put up
barricades of burning tires and soldiers fired in the air to
disperse crowds.
   The capital was deserted Friday night but gunfire could be heard
downtown.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said the U.S. Embassy in Port-Au-Prince received an unconfirmed
report that one of those injured Friday was a U.S. citizen.
   Radio Haiti Inter, an independent station, said at least three
people were wounded in Friday's shooting at a state university
campus a half-mile from the National Palace.
   Earlier Friday, hundreds of protesters, some hurling rocks,
blocked main roads in Port-au-Prince, bringing the capital of 1
million to a near-standstill with schools, stores and government
offices closed.
   Heavily armed soldiers milled around the entrance of the white
National Palace. Two anti-aircraft guns stood on the front lawn,
facing Champ de Mars Plaza.
   On John Brown Avenue, a main thoroughfare, soldiers and police
were seen climbing out of truck and clubbing youths standing by a
burning tire barricade.
   Radio stations said demonstrations also occurred Friday in the
northern port of Cap-Haitien, where soldiers fired tear gas to
scatter about 4,000 protesters, and in the western port of
Gonaives, where 500 students marched peacefully wearing black
armbands.
   Three people were killed Thursday, including a soldier beaten to
death by a mob, and at least 15 injured in countrywide
demonstrations, according to reports from radio stations, witnesses
and a doctor at the state hospital in Port-au-Prince.
   The protests were triggered by the killing Monday of schoolgirl
Rosaline Vaval by a soldier in a passing car in Petit Goave, about
30 miles west of the capital. Similar protests over the killing of
three high school students in 1985 led to Duvalier's downfall in
1986.
   Shooting broke out in Port-au-Prince Friday after soldiers and
police began a sweep of the city, dispersing crowds and arresting
protesters, radio stations said.
   Jerry Timmins, a reporter for the British Broadcasting Corp.,
said he saw soldiers pull up in a truck and fire on about 250
protesters at the state university's Human Sciences College.
   He said some soldiers fired into the air but others fired at
body level. The soldiers beat at least a dozen students, although
their demonstration had been peaceful, Timmins said.
   Timmins said a soldier fired at him, narrowly missing his head.
   On Thursday, about 3,000 people marched through Port-au-Prince
in a symbolic funeral for Miss Vaval.
   About 10,000 people attended her burial Thursday in Petit Goave.
That night, a mob rampaged through the town, burning an army
outpost, ransacking a government building and the mayor's house,
reported Radio Lumiere, a Protestant station.
   Mobs also were reported Thursday night in Gonaives, a resident
said.
   Ms. Tutwiler said that while the airport was reported open, some
airlines have temporarily suspended service to Haiti, which
occupies the western third of Hispaniola island.

<HEAD>Mayor Alleges Police Set-Up Over Brother's Alleged Drug Dealing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor John Daniels said some police
officials tried to use his brother's alleged drug dealing ``to get
something on me'' and improperly influence his choice of a police
chief, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   Robert Daniels, 48, was arrested on drug trafficking charges
Feb. 6, when the mayor was interviewing candidates for police
chief. He made the appointment 10 days later.
   The mayor doesn't believe the timing was coincidence, he told
The Boston Globe. Daniels noted that police had taken an interest
in his brother much earlier.
   ``I firmly believe it was a setup,'' Daniels told the newspaper.
   The mayor said he got several calls from the Police Department
telling him there was a warrant for his brother's arrest and asking
him, ``What do you want us to do?''
   ``I shocked them,'' Daniels recalled, saying he told police,
``Arrest my brother. He is not above the law. I want no cover-up.''
   ``They wanted to get something on me,'' Daniels told the Globe.
   The former chief, William Farrell, said Thursday he didn't know
of any irregularities in the investigation of the mayor's brother.
   ``The case was handled in a normal fashion,'' Farrell said.
   The mayor's office said Thursday that Daniels declined to
comment on the report. But an administration source, who spoke to
The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said the mayor had
said similar things in private.
   In choosing a replacement for Farrell, who announced shortly
after the mayor took office Jan. 1 that he would retire, Daniels
bypassed candidates within the department and chose Nicholas
Pastore, a former New Haven police lieutenant, who has gone into
private business.
   Among the candidates for the job was Capt. Rafael Garcia, head
of the street crimes drug unit that was involved in the
investigation of Daniels' brother. Although he wasn't named chief,
Garcia was promoted this week to head the Police Department's
patrol division.
   Farrell said he called the mayor the day after a Feb. 1 raid on
Robert Daniels' apartment to alert the mayor that a warrant was
being prepared for his brother's arrest. He said the mayor thanked
him for the call.
   ``I told him something to the effect, `I've got bad news. Your
brother's apartment was raided and they found drugs,'' Farrell said.

   An estimated 2 million people have been tested
for AIDS in publicly funded programs, and at least 6 percent were
found to be among the million or so Americans believed infected,
experts said Thursday.
   From 1985 to 1989, 2.5 million tests for HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS, were performed by 63 publicly funded prevention
programs across the country, the Centers for Disease Control
reported.
   Of the tests given, 149,639, or 6 percent, were positive.
   Considering that between 12 percent and 30 percent of AIDS tests
are apparently repeat tests, that leaves an estimated 2 million
people tested, with 123,000, or 6 percent, to 145,000 of them
infected, the CDC said.
   ``One of the things that surprises me is how many people have
elected to learn their (AIDS-virus) antibody status, and what they
can do to protect themselves,'' said Dr. Stephen Bowen, deputy
director for HIV in the CDC's Center for Prevention Services.
   Many of the estimated 1 million people overall infected with HIV
are unaware of their infection, the Atlanta-based CDC said in its
weekly report.
   Out of more than 1 million people tested in the last two years
whose AIDS risk groups were known, 44 percent were heterosexuals at
risk, including those with high-risk partners or multiple sex
partners, and 29 percent were heterosexuals who reported no AIDS
risk factors, but were tested anyway.
   Fourteen percent were homosexual or bisexual men _ who make up
the largest group of AIDS victims _ and 9 percent were heterosexual
intravenous drug abusers _ the second-leading AIDS risk group.
   Positive-test rates were highest for gay men who abused
injectable drugs; 17 percent of such test subjects were told they
were infected. The gay or bisexual men tested were infected at a
rate of 16.5 percent.
   Health officials ``don't have a real good handle'' on the number
of people who have been tested at private physicians' offices not
participating in the publicly funded AIDS programs, Bowen said.
Such tests are not necessarily reported to health officials.
   More than 120,000 AIDS cases have been reported in the United
States, with more than 72,000 deaths. The CDC recommended efforts
to ensure that even more people with undetected HIV infections
receive testing and counseling.

   Supporters of tougher fuel-efficiency
standards abandoned efforts Thursday to attach them to a clean air
bill pending in the Senate, handing the automobile industry at
least a temporary victory.
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., withdrew an amendment which would
have required automakers to improve the average mileage of new car
fleets to about 40 miles per gallon in 2001.
   New car fleets must average 27.5 mpg now.
   ``I do not want to prolong the debate. I must say it's awfully
tempting,'' Bryan said in a floor speech. He vowed to renew his
push for higher standards later, either as a separate bill or as
part of a package aimed at reducing the threat of global warming.
   Supporters described Bryan's move as a tactical retreat made
necessary by last week's clean-air deal between the Senate
leadership and the Bush administration, a deal to which many
senators are committed even though they might otherwise back Bryan.
   The compromise deleted the fuel economy provision included in
the bill as approved by a committee last fall.
   ``The bottom line here is we're going to come back and fight the
auto industry in a couple of months,'' said Daniel Becker, lobbyist
for the Sierra Club.
   Auto allies, aware that the fuel economy battle is far from
over, reacted guardedly.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., reiterated his view that the fuel
efficiency standards should not be linked with the clean air bill
because the environmental issue at stake is global warming, not air
pollution.
   Improved fuel efficiency would lessen autos' emissions of carbon
dioxide, a major cause of global warming.
   When Congress considers a global warming bill, ``all sources of
carbon dioxide emissions can be considered and the most
cost-effective means of achieving reductions can be seleted,''
Levin said.
   Spokesman for General Motors, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.
vowed to contest future efforts to resurrect Bryan's proposal.
   ``The technology doesn't exist to get us to 40 mpg whether it's
forced on the industry by an amendment or a separate bill,''
Chrysler spokesman John Guiniven said.

<TEXT>
   A group of House staffers spent more than
$28,000 going to Europe to plan a trip for lawmakers, but received
a jolt just before their return flight _ the bosses decided to stay
home.
   The decision to scrap the travel _ after the staffers had gone
to London, Paris, Rome and elsewhere _ has triggered a dispute
between the two lawmakers who planned it.
   Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., the chief organizer, canceled the
trip. He said he didn't want to use a military plane during the
U.S. invasion of Panama, which began while the advance team was in
Europe.
   But Rep. Doug Barnard Jr., D-Ga., said he suspected his
colleagues got ``cold feet'' because of harsh winter weather in
Europe and bad publicity at home.
   According to House records, the six-member advance team spent
more than $28,000 for lodging, meals, commercial air transportation
and other expenses between Dec. 13-20. The staffers and members
contended they learned useful information regardless of the
cancellation.
   The lawmakers were to have traveled in January to gather
information on Europe's move toward a unified financial system.
   Aides to Annunzio and Barnard also now disagree over whether the
January itinerary was even set. The lawmakers' respective advance
teams scouted different cities.
   Curtis Prins, staff director of the Annunzio-led House Banking
subcommittee on financial institutions, said the military jet would
have taken members to Strasbourg in France, London, Brussels and
Rome. Those were the cities visited by Annunzio's staffer on the
advance mission, subcommittee economist Gregory Hallisey.
   Five House Government Operations subcommittee staffers traveled
for Barnard to Paris, Brussels and Madrid. One of those staffers,
Peter Barash, said the stops had ``not been fixed'' by the members.
   Barash was staff director of the Government Operations
subcommittee on commerce, consumer and monetary affairs, a job he
left on March 1. Barnard is chairman of that panel and also serves
on Annunzio's subcommittee. A sixth congressional staffer on the
trip was assigned to Barnard's committee by Congress' investigative
arm, the General Accounting Office.
   Barnard bristled over Annunzio's decision to cancel the trip,
maintaining it is vital lawmakers planning to restructure the U.S.
banking system learn firsthand about Europe's move toward unified
financial services by 1992.
   Barash said he held useful meetings with foreign tax
authorities, U.S. officials involved in tax enforcement,
representatives of the European Community and U.S. Chamber of
Commerce officials.
   ``We've been doing serious and hard work,'' he said.
   Annunzio said in an interview that he canceled the trip because
``I could not in good conscience justify using military personnel''
and equipment when the U.S. forces ``were fighting and dying'' in
Panama.
   He said the military jet transport, a version of the commercial
Boeing 707, ``might have been needed in Panama and I wanted to make
sure it would be available for that purpose.''
   Barnard, in a separate interview, said, ``I doubt if we're that
limited'' in military equipment.
   He said several members who originally signed up had dropped out
before the invasion, leaving so few lawmakers that use of a
military plane couldn't be justified anyway.
   Barnard added he knew of previous trips where ``at least a
minority of people got cold feet'' because of potential adverse
publicity.
   ``It sounds alluring to go to London, Paris and Madrid, but when
it gets down to going in wintertime, it's not as appealing and they
change their minds,'' he said.
   Barnard said he would like to reschedule the trip for Congress'
Easter break. Annunzio noted members will be busy with primary and
general elections this year, but he said he would revive the trip
``if I see interest.''
   Prins, staff director of Annunzio's subcommittee, said 19 House
members were signed up at one point for the January trip, and the
party would have reached 41 including military escorts, spouses and
staff members.
   The number of House members had dwindled to 12 just before the
cancellation, Prins said, but he and Annunzio insisted the trip
would have gone ahead with that number if the invasion had not
intervened.
   Prins acknowledged ``if we had many more defections,'' the trip
would have been canceled even without the invasion.

<HEAD>Charges Dropped Against Kentucky Dentist Accused of Killing Horses</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. attorney's office has quietly dropped
charges against a Kentucky dentist accused of scheming to kill race
horses for insurance money, prosecutors confirmed Thursday.
   Dr. Joseph J. Brown, of Shelbyville, Ky., was arrested Feb. 17
in a Calder Race Course thoroughbred barn on charges of wire fraud
charges.
   A source close to the investigation, who spoke to The Associated
Press on condition of anonymity, said prosecutors agreed to drop
the charges in exchange for Brown's cooperation with federal
investigators in Kentucky.
   The case evolved after Brown allegedly told an undercover agent
for the Thorougbred Racing Protective Board that he would kill
racehorses for a share of the insurance profits.
   ``The case was dismissed by U.S. Magistrate Peter Palermo on a
motion by the government,'' U.S. attorney's office spokeswoman
Diane Cossin said Thursday. The charges were dropped March 1.
   The case was dismissed without prejudice, she said, meaning it
can be filed again at any time.
   At the time of his arrest, Brown, 43, had two vials of a clear
liquid and two syringes hidden in his socks, according to an FBI
affidavit, and apparently intended to give a thoroughbred a lethal
injection, Miami FBI spokesman Paul Miller said.
   The FBI alleged the dentist said he would charge $15,000 to kill
the horse at Calder _ $2,500 down and the rest upon settlement of
the insurance claim.
   The FBI affidavit made references to the related deaths of
horses in New Jersey and New York. But the Thoroughbred Racing
Association in New York found no evidence of suspicious deaths at
tracks in those states, said Chris Scherf, executive vice president
of the organization.

   Macie Margaret Stanford Coffey, described
as one of the last three surviving members of the 84-member Army
Nurse Corps that served in World War I, has died at age 99.
   Mrs. Coffey died Monday at Providence Convalescent Residence.
   A Charlotte doctor, Addison Brenizer Sr., was commissioned to
set up the medical unit in 1917 and recruited doctors and nurses
from Charlotte, Wadesboro, Davidson and Rock Hill in South Carolina.
   The National Organization for World War Nurses said only two
other members of the corps now survive.
   Betty Cardo said her aunt told her she witnessed the deaths of
scores of soldiers during the war and said the corps had to work
without antibiotics.
   ``This was before the age of modern medicine,'' Ms. Cardo said.
``She said so many died from poisonous gas and gangrene. Modern
drugs probably would have saved most of their lives.''
   She returned home from Europe in 1919 and was hired as a nurse
at the Asheville School for Boys, where she met and later married
the school's dean, A.A. Coffey.
   Ms. Cardo's daughter, Nancy Huffman, said her great-aunt ``felt
her duty was to go out into the world and take care of it. She
thought that being a nurse was the best way to do that.''

   The Idaho House voted Thursday to repeal the
state's abortion ``trigger law,'' which sets criminal penalties of
up to five years in prison both for physicians who perform and
women who get abortions.
   In developments elsewhere, Cincinnati's archbishop asked
abortion clinic operators to voluntarily refrain from Holy
Communion, and Planned Parenthood said it would appeal a ruling
upholding the federal government's right to bar family planning aid
to foreign organizations that perform abortions.
   And in Alabama, a bill that would require pre-abortion
counseling and an overnight wait prior to any abortion passed the
House of Representatives 79-18 on Thursday. But the measure faces
tough election-year opposition in the state Senate.
   With little debate, Idaho House members voted 54-28 to erase the
so-called trigger law, which wouldn't take effect unless the U.S.
Supreme Court allows states to outlaw abortion.
   The repeal measure was forwarded to the state Senate, where it
was expected to pass.
   ``I don't think anyone in this House would like the women of
Idaho to be subject to criminal penalties for having an abortion,''
said Rep. Gary Robbins, a Democrat who introduced the repeal
measure. ``I think the women of Idaho are able to make their own
choices, and if they do so I don't think they ought to be
penalized.''
   The law was adopted by the Legislature in 1973, shortly after
the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision essentially legalizing
abortion on demand through the first two trimesters of pregnancy.
If it were to go into effect, the Idaho law would mandate prison
terms of two to five years for physicians who perform abortions and
one to five years for women undergoing them.
   The law couldn't take effect under provisions of Roe vs. Wade,
hence the ``trigger'' desingation. If the high court were to
overturn that landmark ruling, and allow states to once again ban
abortion, the Idaho law would take effect on a proclamation by the
governor.
   In the Idaho House debate Thursday, anti-abortion lawmakers
argued that lifting the threat of criminal penalties ignores the
rights of the unborn.
   ``Some of us are here to speak for those who can't speak for
themselves. Do they not count for something?'' asked Rep. Elizabeth
Allan-Hodge, a Republican. ``For those of us who believe it is
murder to kill the unborn, we cannot possibly believe we should
slap them on the hand and tell them it's wrong.''
   In Cincinnati, Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk said Wednesday that
Roman Catholics who operate abortion clinics or promote abortion
rights shouldn't receive the sacrament of Holy Communion.
   The head of the Cincinnati Archdiocese stopped short of
excommunicating or forbidding Holy Communion to pro-choice
activists.
   ``Catholics who obstinately persist in these activities, while
perhaps not formally excommunicated, should not consider themselves
properly disposed to participate in receiving Holy Communion,''
Pilarczyk said.
   Pilarcayk's statement was released after a meeting with abortion
opponents who complained that Barbara Rinto, a Catholic who is the
new director of Planned Parenthood of Cncinnati, violates church
law by operating a clinic that performs abortions.
   Ms. Rinto has said that her feelings on abortion are ``between
me and my God,'' and that her beliefs about birth control and
reproduction are private.
   In New York, Planned Parenthood announced Thursday it would
appeal a ruling by a federal judge there that upheld a federal
policy _ instituted under the Reagan administration and continued
under President Bush _ barring family planning aid to private
foreign organizations that perform abortions.
   The policy, adopted by the Agency for International Development
1984, requires that foreign private health agencies, in return for
American grants, certify that they didn't perform or actively
promote abortion as a method of family planning.
   Planned Parenthood, which assists private foreign agencies, had
charged that the policy was a violation of their First Amendment
right to advocate abortion and interfered with the rights of
privacy of people seeking family planning information.

   Stunned by allegations of child labor law
violations, Burger King Corp. said it has strict policies governing
young employees but would review the rules at its U.S. restaurants.
   An executive at the nation's No. 2 fast-food chain called the

   ``This is the first time we have received any indication of
alleged violations,'' said Nigel Travis, senior vice president for

   Burger King, a subsidiary of Britain's Grand Metropolitan PLC,
was charged in U.S. District court Wednesday with violating federal
child labor laws in its more than 800 company-owned restaurants in

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says his
department will use its own recipe when drawing up food labels to
give consumers more information on what they eat.
   In effect, Yeutter has told Health and Human Services Secretary
Louis Sullivan that a plan for requiring improved nutrition
labeling for most foods may fly in the Food and Drug Administration
but not necessarily in the Agriculture Department.
   ``We will certainly study and evaluate what HHS has suggested,''
Yeutter said Thursday. ``There's some merit in having these rules
as consistent as possible, but we make our own decisions at USDA.''
   Sullivan told a food policy conference on Wednesday that the
grocery store has become ``a Tower of Babel'' because of so many
labels confronting consumers. He said some labels omit vital
information and make unfounded health claims.

   A molecule created in a California laboratory
has shown in a test tube experiment that it can ambush the AIDS
virus and keep the deadly disease from spreading, according to a
study published today.
   Dr. John J. Rossi, a researcher at the Bechman Research
Institute of the City of Hope in Duarte, Calif., reports in the
journal Science that his laboratory has made a synthetic ribozyme
that can genetically cripple the AIDS virus and prevent it from
reproducing.
   The ribozyme, said Rossi, ``is inside the cell and it's waiting
there like a soldier waiting for the enemy to come.''
   Ribozymes eventually could be useful in combating AIDS and other
virus infections, he said, but the technique is still years away
from being ready to treat patients.

   A Hollywood executive and his wife
were gunned down by two sons who stood to inherit more than $10
million, police alleged in announcing one son's arrest and an
international hunt for the other.
   In an eerie twist, the one still at large had co-written a
screenplay _ which his mother helped type _ about a son who kills
his rich parents.
   Lyle Menendez, 22, was arrested Thursday and charged with his
19-year-old brother Erik with the shotgun slaying of his father,
Jose Menendez, and mother, Mary Louis ``Kitty'' Menendez.
   The couple were slain in August while watching television in
their Beverly Hills mansion.

   A 14-month campaign to make honesty a city
policy ends today, and its leader and police say they cannot tell a
lie: It hasn't rid the city of liars, cheats or scoundrels.
   ``We haven't wiped out crime or made everybody honest, but we
have made people think about it. That's what we intended to do,''
said Jeb Stuart Magruder, the former Watergate conspirator who led
the ``Take an Honest Look'' campaign.
   The privately financed $35,000 campaign in this Midwestern city
of 566,000 closes today with a speech by Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young
and an awards ceremony honoring those whose honesty was exemplary.
   The guest list excludes those responsible for an increase in
crime in Columbus last year. Homicides rose by 29 percent from
1988, car thefts by 22 percent and aggravated assaultsby 5 percent.

<HEAD>Actor Oscar Nominees Played Diverse Characters</HEAD>

   A disabled Marine, an old woman's chauffeur,
a cerebral palsy victim, an English teacher and a king of England _
these are the widely divergent characterizations nominated by the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the best
performance by an actor in 1989.
   Rarely has the Oscar race offered such a range of portrayals,
making perilous any predictions of the winner on March 26. Daniel
Day-Lewis and Tom Cruise have been termed the favorites, but it's
still anybody's guess.
   An Oscar for Cruise would reward a star who is already on top of
the Hollywood heap. After four smash hits in a row _ ``The Color of
Money,'' ``Top Gun,'' ``Cocktail'' and ``Rain Man''_ he is the
actor studios want most.
   Cruise took a chance with ``Born on the Fourth of July,''
devoting painful months to portray Ron Kovic, the paraplegic
Vietnam veteran who became an anti-war activist.
   ``Tom worked for nothing for 18 months to make this picture
happen,'' says director Oliver Stone. ``He came from the same
background as Ron: working class, Catholic upbringing. He was
motivated by the same desires to be the best at what he does, to be
a champion.''
   In an interview Cruise said of his role: ``I'd like people to
see that Kovic is not simply a victim. Instead, he creates his life
every day in the face of more difficulty than most of us have
experienced. That was crucial for me to understand: that we have to
fight back when we meet adversity.''
   Christy Brown's adversity seemed insuperable. Born into a large,
poor Dublin family, his cerebral palsy made control of his body
impossible _ except for his left foot. Yet he managed to become an
acclaimed artist and writer.
   Daniel Day-Lewis, last seen as the libertine surgeon in ``The
Unbearable Lightness of Being,'' undertook the punishing role in
``My Left Foot.'' The son of a one-time poet laureate of England
and an actress, Day-Lewis spent time in a Dublin clinic studying
how children with cerebral palsy coped with their handicaps.
   ``It became very important to me that it didn't become a film
about a supposedly able-bodied actor taking on the physical
manifestations of this supposedly disabled man,'' the actor says.
``That seemed to me of secondary importance.''
   Morgan Freeman, who won an Academy nomination as supporting
actor with his vicious pimp in ``Street Smart,'' plays a far
different role in ``Driving Miss Daisy.'' He is the patient,
understanding chauffeur for a cantankerous Southern Jewish woman,
Jessica Tandy. Freeman, who spent his early years in Greenwood,
Miss., had no trouble understanding the role of a black man in the
postwar South.
   ``Having grown up in the South, I knew this man,'' he said. ``I
don't think of him as being `subservient.' You live in a certain
society, and that society has rules, and you abide by them. You can
always do that with a certain amount of dignity.''
   Freeman had the advantage of originating the role of Hoke in the
off-Broadway version of Alfred Uhry's play. ``This character was
totally realized on paper,'' Freeman remarks. ``There was little
for me to do but slip into it and do it.''
   For Kenneth Branagh, having played ``Henry V'' in the theater
was a distinct advantage. He was directing as well as starring in
the film version.
   ``Since I had already played the role with the Royal Shakespeare
Company,'' says the Belfast-born Branagh, ``it was in the blood.
When I did a take, it was like a release; all I had to do was be
the character. I could use the medium as spontaneously as if Henry
was a modern figure.
   ``As soon as I finished the take, I had to face questions about
the costumes, the lighting and whatever. If I had not been familiar
with the role, it would have been terrifying.''
   ``Dead Poets Society'' provided an ideal vehicle for Robin
Williams, allowing him to use his quicksilver wit within the
context of a drama. He plays John Keating, a teacher who cajoles
the students at a 1960s boys school to unshackle their
imaginations. The film was entirely different when presented to
Williams by director Peter Weir.
   ``The first draft had the whole thing where Keating was dying of
cancer and that's why he was coming back and doing one last good
deed before he died,'' the actor said in an interview. ``It would
be real melodramatic that way, like `Love Story.' It was too much.
Let's focus on the boys, let's make their story stronger. And
(Weir) did just that.
   ``It's not about one man against the system. ... It's about one
man coming with some ideas and boys taking them and going off in
every direction.''
   Williams' suggestion cut down his role to what some actors would
consider a supporting part. But the impact of his personality was
strong enough to prompt academy voters to give him a second
nomination as best actor. His first was for ``Good Morning,
Vietnam'' in 1987.

   Khaled Mariem came home crying one
day and said a teacher had lectured about an infidel woman in the
government who was trying to destroy Islam. The woman was his
mother.
   Mariem bint Ahmed Aisha, who is 35 and does not wear a veil, is
director of the Women's Affairs Department in President Maaouyia
Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya's largely military government.
   She got into trouble with fundamentalists by speaking out
against polygamy. Mrs. Mariem says her efforts are not directed
against Islam, but at improving the status of women in this
overwhelmingly Moslem nation.
   When her 14-year-old son described what had happened in school,
she told him: ``Your mother is a good Moslem. She is not what the
fundamentalist teacher said.''
   Mrs. Mariem is one of two women in high government positions _
Khadjetou bint Ahmed is minister of commerce and tourism _ but she
became a special target because of her stand on polygamy.
Fundamentalists have urged that her husband divorce her for such
``anti-religious activities.''
   In December, Mrs. Mariem was a guest on a state radio program,
she explained to an interviewer in her office, and ``the subject of
the debate was the emancipation of women.''
   ``I expressed my point of view on certain issues, among which
was polygamy, which is for me a very retrograde practice that
doesn't reflect our modern age,'' she said.
   Polygamy is a sensitive issue in Mauritania, a largely desert
land in North Africa.
   Aissata Kan, who in the 1970s became the first woman Cabinet
member, worked hard as minister of social affairs for a law
prohibiting polygamy.
   She succeeded in getting it passed, but her husband left her the
night of its approval and returned a few days later with a second
wife. The law against polygamy was repealed later.
   Of the angry reaction by fundamentalists to her own stand
against polygamy, Mrs. Mariem said: ``To say that polygamy has no
place in our era was, for them, the same as saying that Islam is
not good for every time and place.''
   The storm surrounding Mrs. Mariem put the government in the
difficult position of trying to safeguard her without offending the
fundamentalists.
   As she explained it, the teacher at her son's school had spoken
of ``an infidel woman protected by the government who is using the
official media to destroy Islam.''
   Official media, particularly television, were ordered not to
cover her activities. She already had caused a stir in Islamic
circles by appearing on television in her non-traditional clothing.
   In mosques, public meetings and speeches, the campaign against
her grew.
   ``I was really terrified,'' she said. ``I became a devil for our
conservative society. My husband, who is a religious man, was told
to divorce me because a Moslem is not permitted to be married to an
apostate.''
   Her main opponent has been Sheik Mohamed Ould Sidi Yahya, a
cleric with a wide following. His speeches have been played over
loudspeakers all over the country.
   They are heard on buses and even in taxis, often whether the
passenger wants to hear them or not.
   Yahya made two tapes attacking Mrs. Mariem. The government
finally ordered their confiscation and the withdrawal of all
recorded speeches by fundamentalists.
   ``They are good proof against him,'' she said of the tapes. ``I
was prepared to prosecute him, but could not because of pressure
from his tribe (and) from different personalities sent as mediators.
   ``The most important thing is that I deprived them of a good
means of propaganda.''
   Mrs. Mariem's department has been attached directly to the
secretariat of the ruling military committee. She described that as
a government gesture to strengthen her position.
   She said her fight in a country where the segregation of women
is still the rule ``will not be finished until Mauritanian women
achieve their rights.''
   ``The situation of Mauritanian women is not ... what it should
be,'' Mrs. Mariem said. ``We are still considered a beautiful
creation whose only task is to please men.''

<HEAD>Same Film Cancellation Theory Doesn't Always Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When two actors in the same movie are
nominated for Academy Awards, the common belief is that they will
cancel each other out.
   But it doesn't always happen. Sometimes, one wins.
   F. Murray Abraham won as best actor for ``Amadeus'' in 1984,
although Tom Hulce was nominated for the same film.
   In recent years, there have been other winners and losers for
the same movie: Shirley MacLaine (Debra Winger) _ best actress,
``Terms of Endearment,'' 1983; Jessica Lange (Teri Garr) _
supporting actress, ``Tootsie,'' 1982; Timothy Hutton (Judd Hirsch)
_ supporting actor, ``Ordinary People,'' 1980; Meryl Streep (Jane
Alexander) _ supporting actress, ``Kramer vs. Kramer,'' 1979; Peter
Finch (William Holden) _ actor, ``Network,'' 1976.
   The phenomenon will be tested again this year. Lena Olin and
Anjelica Huston are both nominated for supporting actress for their
roles in ``Enemies, a Love Story.''
   The two actresses offer an interesting contrast, one a member of
an American acting dynasty, the other a product of the European
theater. Huston made history in 1986, when she became a
third-generation Oscar winner as supporting actress in ``Prizzi's
Honor.'' She had been directed by her father, John Huston, himself
an Academy Award winner as writer-director of ``The Treasure of the
Sierra Madre'' in 1948. His father, Walter, was named best
supporting actor for the same film.
   In ``Enemies, a Love Story,'' Huston plays an Auschwitz survivor
who comes to New York to confront her husband, Ron Silver. She has
described her character as ``magnificent, extremely intelligent and
honest, compassionate and yet not self-sacrificing. I loved being
able to make that statement.''
   ``She's after the truth all the time, she can't compromise, and
that's what I like about her,'' comments Lena Olin about her role.
She is another of the three wives of Silver in the Paul Mazursky
film.
   Olin was born in Stockholm and became a protegee of Ingmar
Bergman, for whom she acted in ``After the Rehearsal'' and ``Fanny
and Alexander.'' She first drew attention from American audiences
as the free-living photographer in ``The Unbearable Lightness of
Being.''
   Like Huston, Dianne Wiest is an Oscar winner; hers came two
years ago as supporting actress for her role in ``Hannah and Her
Sisters.'' She has been a member of the Woody Allen stock company,
having also appeared in ``The Purple Rose of Cairo,'' ``Radio
Days'' and ``September.'' Her second nomination comes for her
anguished single mother in ``Parenthood.''
   An Army brat, Wiest lived all over the world and began acting at
the University of Maryland. She spent four years at Washington's
Arena Stage Theater, then appeared in many New York plays,
including ``Othello'' as James Earl Jones' Desdemona.
   Julia Roberts is the youngest of the supporting actress
nominees. The doomed daughter of Sally Field in ``Steel
Magnolias,'' she was the only performer in the all-star cast to be
recognized by the Academy. Born in Smyrna, Ga., she studied acting
in New York and first drew attention in movies as a waitress in
``Mystic Pizza.''
   Brenda Fricker joined the nominees for her role as the steadfast
mother of cerebral palsy victim Daniel Day-Lewis in ``My Left
Foot.'' Previously unknown to American audiences, she is well known
as an actress in the London theater and the popular BBC series,
``Casualty.''
   Fricker was born and educated in Dublin, where ``My Left Foot''
takes place. She worked for the Irish Times newspaper before
turning to acting.

   Brenda Fricker only found out about her Oscar
nomination because she happened to be visiting her 80-year-old
father the day the 62nd annual Academy Award nominations were
announced.
   That's because Fricker doesn't have a telephone at her holiday
cottage in Dublin, and would like to keep it that way.
   ``Nothing will equal the excitement of that moment,'' Fricker,
45, said of her reaction at hearing she was up against Anjelica
Huston, Lena Olin, Julia Roberts and Dianne Wiest for this year's
supporting actress Oscar.
   Fricker was nominated for ``My Left Foot,'' a low-budget film
about Irish writer Christy Brown, severely crippled by cerebral
palsy, who found renown through painting and writing with his left
foot.
   The film has received an unexpected five nominations, including
best film and best director, as well as leading actor Daniel
Day-Lewis as Christy, and Fricker as his fiercely loyal and loving
mother.
   Why has ``My Left Foot'' done so well in the Oscar race, when
other independent films such as ``sex, lies and videotape'' and
``Do the Right Thing'' were more or less ignored?
   ``Maybe it's because it's a true story, and it's totally
unsentimental,'' Fricker mused.
   Certainly, few scenes in 1989 could match the flinty mother's
softly spoken remark to her tormented son, ``Sometimes I think you
ARE my heart.''
   In a recent interview, Fricker talked about the danger of
milking such a part for cheap emotions.
   ``There were places where it was quite tempting, and Jim
(director Jim Sheridan) was in there the whole time, saying `Don't
do that,' and he was absolutely right,'' she said.
   ``I was resisting it myself, and I kept saying to Jim, `If you
see one hint of it in my voice or face, pull me up immediately.'''
   She had thought her performance was not the sort to win prizes.
   ``The style of acting I do is extreme underacting,'' she said.
``It's insulting to the audience if you overstate everything. When
I'm a member of the audience, I love guessing what actors are
thinking on screen.''
   A lengthy stage career has included stints at the Abbey in
Dublin and at the Royal Shakespeare Company and National Theater in
London. She has been a series regular for five seasons on
``Casualty,'' an English medical drama shot in Bristol, west of
London, where she lives.
   While she doesn't think she will win the Oscar, she knows whom
she is rooting for: Anjelica Huston, for Paul Mazursky's ``Enemies,
a Love Story.''
   ``I really think she should get it,'' Fricker said. ``She's so
versatile, if you think of `Prizzi's Honor' and `The Dead.' She's a
very talented lady.''

   The Supreme Court's nine members are among the
most private of public officials. They wield enormous political
power, but rarely hold news conferences or give interviews. Recent
polls indicate only one in three Americans can name any of the
nine. This, the fourth in an occasional series, offers an
up-to-date look at one member of the nation's highest court.

<TEXT>
   Antonin Scalia often seems impatient with the
pace of change on an increasingly conservative Supreme Court, but
time could be on his side. The comparatively youthful justice may
be using his keen intellect and missionary zeal well into the 21st
century to pull the court farther to the right.
   The prospect delights conservatives and alarms liberals.
   His supporters call him a man of principle unwilling to accept
half-measures. Detractors say he is an extremist bent on undoing
key liberal precedents.
   Both sides agree that Scalia, who turned 54 Sunday and is 30
years younger than the court's oldest member, is assuming the role
of conservative point man played by William H. Rehnquist before he
became chief justice.
   ``There is no question that since Rehnquist has become chief
justice he has seen his role as less of an advocate than a
consensus-builder. A vacuum was created and Scalia filled that
void,'' said Rich Samp of the conservative Washington Legal
Foundation.
   Scalia's confrontational style was on display last year when
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor stopped short of voting to overturn the
court's 1973 ruling in Roe vs. Wade that created a constitutional
right to an abortion.
   Calling O'Connor's position ``irrational,'' a frustrated Scalia
said, ``We can now look forward to at least another term with carts
full of mail from the public and streets full of demonstrators.''
   American University law Professor Herman Schwartz said Scalia,
an ardent foe of judicially created rights, was showing his pique.
   ``I think he was angry, and I think he feels (O'Connor) may have
betrayed the cause. And he's a man who believes in causes,''
Schwartz said.
   Judge Abner Mikva, a former colleague on the federal appeals
court here, on which Scalia served before former President Reagan
named him to the high court in 1986, has described Scalia as warm
and engaging _ and unyielding in fighting for what he believes.
   ``He understands the doctrine of collegiality and has in fact
found middle ground,'' Mikva said. But once Scalia has made up his
mind, ``there's no shaking him loose.''
   Scalia, sticking to his general policy, declined to be
interviewed for this article.
   Gregarious and quick-witted, he normally revels in being the
center of attention. Before a reception held for him by reporters
when he joined the high court, he said, ``I can have more fun if
it's off the record.''
   Assured he would not be quoted for publication, he engaged in a
lively dialogue for hours as reporters peppered him with questions.
   On another occasion, Scalia was asked why he was wearing a
tuxedo to an informal evening get-together at the court.
   He was headed for another party, Scalia said, adding, ``esteemed
jurist by day, man-about-town by night.''
   The same playfulness is apparent at the court's argument
sessions, the justices' only regularly scheduled public appearances.
   Scalia is among the court's most forceful, persistent and
frequent interrogators of the lawyers who argue before the court.
Using the attorneys as foils, he often appears to be trying to
persuade other justices to see his views.
   Sometimes the tactic backfires.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun said after the court's 1987-88 term
that Scalia ``asks far too many questions. He takes over the case
from counsel.''
   Rehnquist once indirectly scolded Scalia from the bench after
the junior justice persisted in quizzing a lawyer about a
procedural matter.
   ``I hope when you're given an opportunity to do so, you'll
address some of your remarks to the question on which the court
voted to grant'' review, Rehnquist told the attorney.
   Scalia's critics worry that he has an agenda for overruling past
decisions, particularly ones that expanded civil rights and
individual liberties.
   ``It is as though he made a list of all the things he didn't
like that the court has done in the last 50 years,'' said American
University's Schwartz. ``Essentially, he sees himself as the agent
of major change to root out these constitutional errors. In many
ways, he's the most radical member'' of the court.
   But Alan Slobodin of the Washington Legal Foundation said
Scalia's only agenda is adhering to the original intent of the
framers of the Constitution and reducing judicial intervention in
decision-making by the executive and legislative branches.
   ``I might call him the originalist conscience of the court,''
Slobodin said. ``He's less interested in vote-counting than in
forcing the justices to confront first principles. He's trying to
make the court more accountable, more principled.''
   Scalia, the court's first Italian-American and father of nine
children, has a strong academic background. He is the only son of
an Italian immigrant father who was a professor at Brooklyn College
and a mother who taught elementary school.
   Scalia graduated first in his class from Georgetown University
and won high honors with his Harvard University law degree. He
taught law for 10 years.
   The impact of his brilliance on the Supreme Court remains
uncertain.
   University of Chicago Law School Dean Geoffrey Stone, who
admires Scalia's boldness, said, ``The thing to keep in mind about
Scalia is he does have very strong intellectual skills that will
lead him to be out in front. The real question is, Will there be
anyone behind him?''

<DATELINE>DOWNPATRICK, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rude slab of granite
inscribed with a Celtic cross and the name ``Patric'' proclaims the
grave of Ireland's patron saint.
   The stone, rough and broken, looks as old as Ireland itself, but
the marker was placed outside the Anglican cathedral around 1900.
   ``I don't feel people should be let down by that,'' said Brian
Turner, curator of the Down County Museum nearby. ``You need a
focus of attention.
   ``It is quite likely that the man who was St. Patrick is buried
somewhere around here.''
   Canon Brian Mayne, a prebendary of the Cathedral of the Holy and
Undivided Trinity, said he was ``99.9 percent certain'' Patrick was
buried somewhere on the hilltop, which attracted 20,000 visitors
last year.
   Turner called it ``95 percent likely that he is buried in Down,
or in Saul,'' two miles away. He is assured by a tradition that can
be traced to the 7th century, although even that remote date is two
centuries after Patrick's death.
   The hills around Downpatrick are dotted with sites related to
Patrick in very iffy ways. Legend say Patrick landed at Saul, and
432 came to be the accepted date.
   Another legend claims he received last rites from St. Tassach,
who is associated with a ruined church at Raholp, near Saul.
   A few miles south, at Struell Wells, more ruins mark the pools
where Patrick is supposed to have immersed himself all night,
singing psalms.
   Patrick stories are found all over Ireland. The Roman Catholic
and Anglican primates have their seats in Armagh because, it is
said, Patrick chose the place.
   Thousands of pilgrims fast and pray in the summer on a little
island in Lough Derg, County Donegal, where, as the story goes,
Patrick wrestled with demons. Many more climb Croagh Patrick in
western Ireland, retracing a saintly journey.
   Based on Patrick's own writings, not one place in Ireland can
definitely be associated with him. All he says about himself is
that he was born in Britain, was taken captive in Ireland, escaped
and later returned as a missionary.
   Patrick probably lived in the 5th century. The traditional dates
are 432 for the beginning of his mission and 461 for his death.
   The first lives of Patrick were written in the 7th century and
collected in 807 in the Book of Armagh, now a treasure of Trinity
College, Dublin.
   The Book of Armagh says Patrick's grave was chosen by two oxen
that were allowed to wander where they would, pulling a cart
bearing the body.
   It's a good story, and so is one Turner found, which was written
down in the 19th century.
   Sometime in the 1700s, it seems, a barber played a prank on the
cathedral's sexton by leaving him half-shaved. The humorless sexton
vowed that the barber never would rest in his family gravesite.
   The sexton had an old cross erected over the barber's family
plot, then spread the word that it marked the grave of St. Patrick.
   Pilgrims came flocking and further burials were impossible.
   ``You know, the Irish always have to make a good story better,''
said Canon Joseph Maguire at the Roman Catholic cathedral.

   For years each school day, Lorraine Begay was
flung from side to side as the van from the local high school
bumped over the 10 miles of rutted dirt roads leading to her Navajo
reservation home.
   The girl, crippled by severe arthritis, wanted to attend a
nearby federal Bureau of Indian Affairs boarding school, but the
bureau would not install the wheelchair ramp and special toilet she
needed.
   Ms. Begay still is being bounced around, this time in federal
court, where she filed suit for unspecified damages after
experiencing what one judge called ``bureaucracy at its worst.''
   Because Ms. Begay cannot sue the federal government directly,
she has sued individual BIA employees ranging from an agency
superintendent to a head custodian, who face financial ruin if she
wins, their lawyers say.
   Both sides are hoping the federal government will reimburse the
employees if Ms. Begay wins a judgment, but the government has
refused any payments so far, though it likely will spend more on
attorneys' fees than it would have cost to settle out of court.
   In addition to the lawyers' fees, the government could be forced
to reimburse the employees for whatever Ms. Begay wins at trial.
U.S. District Judge Carl Muecke said in a January ruling that an
assistant U.S. attorney who represented them early in the
litigation may have botched the case so badly that they will be
able to sue the government for damages.
   No trial date has been set, and the case has dragged on for
years despite general agreement that Ms. Begay suffered
unneccessarily.
   The modifications the school needed to accommodate her
wheelchair would have cost no more than a few thousand dollars at
most, according to court records, and were supposed to have been
made under a federal law mandating access for the handicapped.
   School officials give conflicting reasons as to why the work
wasn't done.
   No records are available detailing how much the lawsuit has cost
the government, but one defense attorney estimates the legal bill
for the four private lawyers alone already has reached $80,000 and
could double or triple if the case goes to trial.
   Ms. Begay, now 23, graduated from high school two years late,
largely because of pain-induced absences. She still lives at home,
with no electricity or running water, in the tiny community of Many
Farms deep inside the sprawling Navajo Reservation.
   Arthritis has confined her to a wheelchair since age 13, and she
often doesn't even have the muscle strength to sit up.
   ``Her mind is wasting away, and that's all she has because her
body obviously doesn't do much for her,'' said Pamela Liberty, who
took on Ms. Begay's case while a legal aid attorney and stuck with
it after moving to private practice.
   ``We're not trying to make this into a million-dollar lawsuit,''
Ms. Liberty said. ``We want what it would take to get her through
college.''
   Ms. Begay's problems began in 1980, but she tried to resolve
them with school officials and did not file suit until July 1985.
   She was offered placement in a distant school for the
handicapped but chose to stay with her family and commute to the
high school while waiting for the local boarding school to install
the ramp and toilet.
   As late as May 21, 1985, she still hoped for an out-of-court
resolution.
   ``I am writing to you to see if you can help me go to school at
Many Farms Boarding High School,'' she said in a handwritten letter
to Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.
   ``They say there is no ramp for my wheel chair,'' she wrote.
``They have told me they would fix the school up so I could go
there but they never have.
   ``I cry a lot because of pains from traveling the reservation
roads. That's why I want to go to a boarding school. I do not want
to go to a handicap school. I am a regular child and want to be in
school with all my brothers and sisters.''
   Government officials made an offer _ $25,000, according to
sources _ relatively early in the case. But Ms. Begay's lawyers
wanted $100,000, figuring that's what it would take to finance four
years at a good, out-of-state college.
   Ms. Begay's acceptable minimum has been rising as the legal
maneuvers by defense attorneys continue. Ms. Liberty's former boss
at Southern Arizona Legal Aid, Bill Morris, now figures the minimum
at $250,000.
   The judge has scoffed at defense claims that Ms. Begay is to
blame because she did not fill out applications after being told
the school couldn't admit her.
   The school telling her to ``forget it'' was like having somebody
``stand at the door with a gun,'' Muecke said.
   Of defense attorneys' claims that only top-level officials in
Washington are at fault, the judge said, ``I find that rather
astonishing. I find that bureaucracy at its worst.''
   ``I don't think any of the defendants have done anything
wrong,'' said Dan Rosenfelt, an Albuquerque, N.M., lawyer who
represents some of the employees, including a school principal who
says he never talked to Ms. Begay and didn't even know about the
problem.
   ``It's not clear that the government did anything wrong,''
Rosenfelt said. ``This is not a case, in my opinion, where justice
cries out for a settlement.''

   In 1954, Volker Schlondorff was a 15-year-old
living in Wiesbaden, West Germany, when he saw Elia Kazan's film
classic ``On the Waterfront.'' After the movie was over, he walked
out of the theater and kept walking _ for hours.
   Schlondorff couldn't stop thinking about how effective movies
were at showing injustice in the world, how well he related to
Marlon Brando's fight against corrupt union officials, how film
seemed larger than life yet completely believeable.
   The same week, Schlondorff saw Alfred Hitchcock's thriller
``Rear Window'' and took another walk. This time he thought of
suspense, watching and being watched, of James Stewart unable to
move out of his wheelchair because of a broken leg, making up
stories about the neighbors on whom he spied.
   Idealism and voyeurism have been a major part of the director's
own work, never more effectively than in the 1979 film, ``The Tin
Drum,'' Schlondorff's acclaimed adaptation of Gunter Grass' novel
about Nazi Germany as seen through a young boy's eyes.
   So Schlondorff had no difficulty agreeing to direct the movie
version of Margaret Atwood's best-selling ``The Handmaid's Tale,''
in which a young woman (Natasha Richardson in the movie) observes
and eventually escapes the horrors of ``Gilead,'' a society ruled
by right-wing fundamentalists.
   ``While we were doing it, we were strongly reminded of `The Tin
Drum,''' Schlondorff said in a recent interview.
   ``The main character of Natasha Richardson and the way she goes
through life, first trying to understand before even reacting. The
so-called passive character, as if to watch and to think wasn't an
activity, is very similar to `Tin Drum,' where he's mostly the
witness of what's happening to others and what's happening to
himself.''
   In Gilead, women live in a strict caste system, their rank
indicated by the color of their clothes. Richardson, dressed in
red, is a handmaid, her sole function to conceive children. Robert
Duvall is the Commander, whose child Richardson is to bear; Faye
Dunaway is his wife, and Aidan Quinn is the Commander's chauffeur,
with whom Richardson falls in love.
   Schlondorff viewed the characters as archetypes, representing
different aspects of society _ the patriarch, the matriarch, etc. _
and thought the story had an epic structure, in line with the
operas he loves to produce.
   ``The whole idea that every character has his aria, then from
time to time there's an ensemble piece. And it's important to have
changes of pace, you can not be fast all the time,'' he said.
   ``There is also the idea of a crescendo and a high point. I like
to work on screenplays some times in terms of music, thinking of
music, and to get the musicians involved in it.''
   Schlondorff emerged in the mid-1960s as part of the Junger
Deutscher Film movement (Young German Film movement), which
included Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Werner Herzog and Wim Wenders.
   His first feature film, ``Young Torless,'' came out in 1966 and
shared the International Critics Prize at Cannes. He has since
directed ``The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum'' and ``Coup de
Grace,'' among others, and also directed the American television
adaptation of ``Death of a Salesman,'' which starred Dustin Hoffman.
   Schlondorff begins his 1981 film, ``Circle of Deceit,'' with an
explanation to the audience that the film, about the civil war in
Lebanon, is just a work of the imagination, only fictional, though
the scenes were shot on location.
   ``The Handmaid's Tale'' is also a work of the imagination, of
course, but Schlondorff had little trouble finding a realistic
setting for a society that supposedly doesn't exist.
   ``We said, `What would an American dictatorship be like?' First
of all, it would be run by advertising people who would try to make
the most gruesome things look comfortable.
   ``This future society would be a cheap society, a K mart
society. You wind up with a world of supermarkets and shopping
malls, and then you go to North Carolina, and you say, `Well, it's
all there.' So we gave up all this big elaboration, and said,
`Let's just shoot the existing world and say it's our future.'''
   Schlondorff considers each of his films a personal creation, no
matter who first developed the story. Noting that Atwood began the
book in Berlin, the director adds his own touch, including a
reconstruction of the Berlin Wall in the opening scene.
   ``I think culture has to do not with reinventing from scratch
all the time, but with reflections and variations on things other
people did before. We are just in a chain of people working again
and again with the same material. It may seem minor to some people,
but it's major enough for me.''

<HEAD>The Sweetest Sounds of Richard Rodgers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   If any phrase could sum up the career of Richard
Rodgers, it is a lyric from ``No Strings,'' the only musical for
which he wrote both words and music.
   ``The sweetest sounds I'll ever hear are still inside my head,''
sing its lead characters, played originally on Broadway by Diahann
Carroll and Richard Kiley. That search for the perfect melody
echoed throughout Rodgers' career of more than 60 years in the
American musical theater, years that were divided into three
distinctive parts.
   The composer's career _ first with Lorenz Hart, then with Oscar
Hammerstein II and finally with a variety of younger lyricists _ is
celebrated in ``Music by Richard Rodgers,'' to be shown Friday,
March 16, on PBS' ``Great Performances.''
   The show, narrated by Shirley Jones, is studded with film clips
from many Rodgers shows _ as different as ``The Garrick Gaities,''
``Pal Joey'' and ``The Sound of Music.''
   And there is an appreciation of Rodgers, who died in 1979, by
other composers including Andrew Lloyd Webber, Burton Lane, Jerry
Herman and Charles Strouse, as well as remembrances by his widow,
Dorothy Rodgers.
   ``He really was a theater writer,'' she said the other day in an
interview at her Fifth Avenue apartment. ``Unlike some other great
writers _ Irving Berlin, for instance, who was the greatest
songwriter who ever lived _ Dick wrote only for the theater or film
or television.''
   Rodgers gave the impression of being a fast writer, able to dash
off music quickly. That wasn't so, Mrs. Rodgers insists. Before he
began composing he would carefully consider what he wanted to
express _ the emotion he was trying to convey and what he wanted to
say to advance the plot. He also considered practical matters, such
as the musical ability of his stars.
   ``Just before he died, he wrote `I Remember Mama,' for Liv
Ullmann who had a range of very few notes,'' Mrs. Rodgers said.
``It was quite a difficult thing to do, but he accepted all such
challenges.''
   Rodgers always looked for something new to do.
   ``He felt the greatest way to insure failure was to repeat
yourself,'' Mrs. Rodgers said.
   His quest for innovation led to four of his best musicals with
Hart, written after an unsatisfying sojourn to Hollywood in the
early 1930s. These landmarks were ``On Your Toes,'' 1936, with its
use of extended ballet sequences created by George Balanchine;
``Babes in Arms,'' 1937, which starred one of the youngest group of
performers ever to appear on Broadway; ``The Boys From Syracuse,''
1938, one of the most successful musical adaptations of a
Shakespeare comedy, and ``Pal Joey,'' 1940, a sophisticated,
sardonic show with Gene Kelly as its charming anti-hero.
   Rodgers always wrote at home. He didn't have an office until
after ``Carousel'' in 1945 when he and Hammerstein started to
produce shows themselves.
   ``Larry Hart and Oscar Hammerstein worked in totally different
ways,'' Mrs. Rodgers recalled. ``Larry could not be forced to put a
word on paper until he heard the tune. But Oscar wanted the freedom
to write the lyric first. Dick didn't care. He could work either
way.
   ``Sometimes he would close open doors because he preferred not
to feel that people were listening until he finished writing. We
all entered into a conspiracy of pretending that we couldn't hear
him until he was done. And he went along with that. He allowed
himself to be fooled.''
   If there was any question about a tune, Rodgers simply threw it
away and wrote another one, Mrs. Rodgers said, although Hart and
Hammerstein mostly used what their partner wrote.
   ``Once in a while, my daughters and I wouldn't let him forget
something we were crazy about that got lost in the tryout period,''
she said. ``One example is `Getting to Know You' which was called
`Suddenly Lucky' when it was in `South Pacific' and then dropped.
`There's a Small Hotel' was written for `Jumbo' and producer Billy
Rose didn't like it, so it was taken out. Later Dick used it in `On
Your Toes.' But it was rare that he used a song again. He felt that
he could always do better writing a new song for a new situation.''
   The Rodgers and Hart partnership ended in 1943 with Hart's death
at the age of 48 of acute pneumonia complicated by alcoholism.
   ``Larry was brilliant but he was basically a very unhappy man,''
Mrs. Rodgers said. ``And if you read his lyrics, that sadness is
there.''
   Even before Hart's death, Rodgers had begun work on a new
project _ which Hart turned down _ to adapt ``Green Grow the
Lilacs'' into a musical play. His partner was Hammerstein and the
show became ``Oklahoma!''
   ``Oscar was a very methodical man. If he said he would finish
the lyric in a week, it would be finished in a week,'' Mrs. Rodgers
said. ``Once Dick and Oscar decided on the musical they would do,
they spent endless hours discussing every aspect of what kind of
show it would be.''
   After ``Oklahoma!'' the Rodgers and Hammerstein partnership
lasted 17 years, and out of it came such classics as ``Carousel,''
``The King and I'' and ``The Sound of Music.''
   Hammerstein died in 1960 of cancer, and Rodgers plunged on alone
with ``No Strings.'' Besides writing both music and lyrics, he did
several interesting things with the show. He put the orchestra on
stage with the actors and took the show's title literally. There
were no stringed instruments in the show.
   Even though Rodgers' last shows, ``Two by Two,'' ``Rex'' and ``I
Remember Mama,'' were unsuccessful they contained soaring melodies.
Such songs as ``I Do Not Know a Day I Did Not Love You,'' ``Away
From You'' and ``You Could Not Please Me More'' are among his most
haunting.
   But even the master had self-doubts about his work.
   ``Oh, yes,'' his wife said. ``at least until he began to work on
the next show. Once he got the first song out, which he called the
first olive out of the jar, then he relaxed and felt confident.''

<HEAD>C.C.H. Pounder Plays Boston Mother in School-Busing Drama `Common
Ground'</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The turbulent events of Boston's school
busing years are told in the two-part CBS miniseries ``Common
Ground'' through three families whose lives cross only at the
schools.
   ``Common Ground,'' based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book by
J. Anthony Lukas, will be broadcast Sunday and Tuesday, essentially
telling three separate stories of how each family is affected by
the busing of the 1960s and '70s. The children occasionally pass
each other on the ``common ground'' of the schools.
   Heading one family is Rachel Twymon, a black divorced woman with
six children.
   ``Basically, all she was after was the best education she could
get for her children,'' said C.C.H. Pounder, who plays Mrs. Twymon.
``She wasn't a spokesperson. She wasn't a radical. At that time,
she wasn't a member of any organization. She was on welfare.''
   Jane Curtin plays Alice McGoff, a widow dismayed that her seven
children might not be allowed to attend neighborhood schools. She
joins an anti-busing group eventually called Powder Keg.
   Richard Thomas is Colin Diver, an idealistic young lawyer whose
liberal attitudes and hopes for a racially mixed society are
challenged by reality.
   The three performers never met in production because their
stories were filmed at different times.
   ``Rachel was a very strong woman, extremely forceful,'' said
Pounder. ``I think she ruled, and not necessarily with a velvet
glove, as she tried to keep her children straight. She was
definitely the strong arm. But her daughters rebelled. She had a
stricter standard for her daughters. The boys got to do what they
wanted.''
   The miniseries, written by Edward Hume and directed by Michael
Newell, was filmed on location in Toronto, Canada, because it was
felt the wounds had not yet healed in Boston. The McGoffs and
Twymons visited the sets during filming. Mrs. Twymon died in
January.
   Pounder, who was born in Guyana and raised mostly in England,
worked closely with a voice coach to learn the colloquial Boston
black accent.
   ``My mother had wanted me to become a newscaster so I wouldn't
lose my British accent,'' she said. ``I now reserve my British
accent exclusively for my family.
   ``Whenever I'm working and doing another accent, I avoid calling
my family. It's hard to switch it on and off. You have to be
afflicted with a parrot tongue, as my mother says.''
   Pounder called the miniseries more than just a story of the
busing issue.
   ``To say that `Common Ground' is about busing in Boston is to
say that `Moby Dick' is about whaling,'' she said. ``Lukas went off
to document each family. He got a story that's really more about
Boston itself.''
   Pounder, whose full name is Carol Christine Hilaria Pounder,
attended a Roman Catholic boarding school in England. She went to
college in this country when her mother, who had worked at the U.S.
Embassy in London, took a job with a New York newspaper.
   ``I started acting at the age of 9 in England,'' she said. ``I
played a lot of pages. I don't think I played a girl until I was
20. It took me the longest time to say out loud that I was an
actress. It seemed to be closely linked to the oldest profession.
When I began, people were skeptical and would ask, `Oh, yeah, what
have you done?'''
   She's done plenty. She's probably best known for her starring
role in the movie ``Bagdad Cafe'' and a featured role in ``Prizzi's
Honor.''
   She's starred in two other miniseries, ``If Tomorrow Comes'' and
``The Atlanta Child Murders,'' and such TV movies as ``Murder in
Mississippi'' and ``No Place Like Home.'' She was a regular on the
comedy series ``Women in Prison'' and has been a guest on ``L.A.
Law'' and ``Hill Street Blues.''
   Pounder was asked to reprise her role as Brenda in the CBS
series based on ``Bagdad Cafe,'' but declined. Whoopi Goldberg
plays the role in the series.
   ``I may do another series, but I felt I had done `Bagdad
Cafe,''' she said. ``If I had done it, I would have done it just
for the money. Brenda's walking a very thin line on being just your
basic hands-on-loudmouth. It could become shallow in a series if
you don't have good writing.''

<HEAD>Sub-Sahara Has Bumper Harvest, But Problems Persist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TIMBUKTU, Mali (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Timbuktu was lucky last year. It rained,
the locusts stayed away and, with some help from the outside,
farmers produced one of the best harvests in half a century.
   Farmers in nearly all the countries that hug the southern Sahara
Desert's harsh border produced similar bumper crops that filled
graneries and children's bellies from Senegal east to Niger.
   The good fortune of 1988 and 1989, welcome as it is, also
illuminates the profound problems facing these poor nations
struggling to feed themselves _ problems that range from a
birthrate that outpaces production to a marketplace that stacks the
deck against even the hardest-working farmer.
   Experts note that, even with the bountiful harvest in most
countries, sub-Saharan Africa imported nearly 9 million tons of
cereal grains in 1988.
   ``Nonetheless, the 500,000-ton grain surplus is spectacular
news,'' said U.S. Ambassador Robert Pringle. ``Now everyone is
wondering how to export what they have grown.''
   Abduleh al Kalifa, hip-deep in a field of emerald-green wheat
rippling in a desert wind near Timbuktu, doesn't worry about
exporting. He just wishes he could sell his surplus 30 miles away,
in Timbuktu.
   ``Five years ago there was no rain, nothing to eat,'' said
Kalifa, 36, already middle-aged in a nation where the average life
expectancy is 49. ``Foreigners gave us everything. These last two
years, the harvests were good. We have hope and two warehouses are
full.
   ``We have more than we can eat, more than we can store and we
can't sell the rest,'' he said. ``How can we get our grain to town
if there are no roads? How can we compete with grain from other
countries? How can we earn enough money to buy food when there is
another drought?''
   Mali's last drought left its mark on the children. Two-year-olds
are solid and round, but children born in the drought of 1984-1985
are spindly, apt to suffer from chronic malnutrition.
   ``If you are malnourished, a few good meals will make you feel
better, but you are still malnourished,'' said Leo DeVos, director
of the United Nations Children's Fund in Mali. ``The whole country
is like these children. It will take more than a couple of good
harvests to put the country back on its feet.
   ``Still, it's nice to see the green,'' he said. ``It is the
color of hope.''
   When UNICEF arrived five years ago with emergency food, the
government was in chaos, people were starving and huge numbers of
refugees arrived in cities each day from the barren countryside.
   Enormous need remained when the crisis ended, so UNICEF and
others stayed on to help.
   The United States, which spends about $30 million a year in
Mali, now helps entrepreneurs and small farmers. West Germany built
warehouses for reserves and a highway that spans a nation as large
as Texas and California combined.
   France, Italy and others fight the advance of the desert, dig
wells, organize cooperatives and help in dozens of other ways.
   UNICEF has concentrated on Timbuktu, a once-mysterious oasis
that still evokes romance and adventure.
   Centuries ago, Timbuktu was a crossroads of caravans, a center
of learning and a garden in the desert, where the river ran deep
and trees hung heavy with fruit.
   Now, the advancing desert has tied a noose of dunes around it
and many donors have written the city off as a lost cause.
   With funds donated by Italian labor unions, UNICEF installed
pumps to make use of Niger River water and drilled wells to tap
ground water for irrigation.
   ``We wanted to set an example, to show what could be done in
even the most precarious situation,'' DeVos said. One result of the
five-year project was the field where Kalifa and his neighbors grew
a 15-ton grain surplus, little of which can be sold.
   The Malian government used to have price controls, which kept
food costs down and made urban voters happy, but discouraged
farmers because of the low return on their labor. Controls were
abolished at the insistence of the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund.
   International donors and lenders also demanded that Mali
eliminate protectionist measures and subsidies to farmers. Their
message was simple: No open markets, no aid.
   ``We have a long-term commitment to food aid, in return for
which we ask that the entire cereal market be freed,'' said Dennis
Brennan, director of the U.S. Agency for International Development
in Bamako.
   With the market wide open, rice from Thailand and Louisiana
costs less in the Timbuktu bazaar than grain grown down the road.
   ``The little guy works like crazy to grow something, pulling
grain from soil that is poor, in primitive conditions and in a
climate that is never favorable, even when there is no drought,''
said Giovanni Fiore, director of UNICEF's Timbuktu project and an
Africa veteran.
   Then, when the farmer produces a surplus, there are no buyers.
No one in the villages has any cash and consumers in Timbuktu buy
whatever is cheapest.
   ``It comes from Europe or the United States where farmers
receive subsidies,'' Fiore said. ``How can a Malian compete? He has
no subsidy. All he has is taxes and the high cost of the pump,
gasoline, oil, fertilizer, all of which has to be imported at
double, triple, 10 times the cost to an American.
   ``Meanwhile, the donors tie aid to an open market in which
farmers from developed countries can sell their surplus. So our
farmers eat what they can, store a little, which will last a year
or two, and when there is another extended drought, there will be
famine.''

   The Federal Communications Commission took
another big step toward a deregulated interstate long-distance

shareholders.
   In exchange for the vote, Icahn agreed Thursday not to wage a
proxy fight or submit other matters for consideration at the steel,
oil and gas giant's May 7 annual meeting, USX said.
   Stockholders will be asked whether USX should incorporate a

   Campeau Corp., the financially distressed owner
of U.S. department stores operating under bankruptcy-court
supervision, said it will not pay $5.2 million in interest due on
loans from two major lenders.
   Failure to pay the interest, due Wednesday under special
arrangements made last week postponing earlier payment deadlines,
meant Campeau went into default Thursday on loans from Olympia &amp;
York Developments Ltd. and Edward J. DeBartolo Corp.
   But the lenders have agreed they will not move to collect their
collateral without notifying Campeau nine days in advance.

American Express Co. from buying all publicly held shares of the
firm, alleging the price is too low.
   In one lawsuit, shareholders also claim that Primerica Corp.
offered to invest $900 million in exchange for a 40 percent stake
in Shearson during talks that ended last week without a deal and
preceded the stock buyback proposal.
   American Express officials said Thursday the suits were
``totally without merit.'' The company announced the stock buyback
March 4 as part of a plan to take control of its ailing Wall Street

   Futures exchange leaders slammed a
regulatory agency's plan to restrict dual trading and instead
backed congressional proposals that emphasize better surveillance
of their markets.
   Karsten Mahlmann, chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade, said
Thursday the dual-trading restrictions being considered by the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, together with other reform
proposals that would increase trading costs, constitute a ``death
threat'' to the futures industry.
   Dual trading is the legitimate practice among floor brokers of
trading for their own accounts after executing any orders from
their public customers.

<HEAD>Good February Sales Gains Favorable Omen for Retailers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Specialty apparel stores appear poised to outrun their mass
merchandising competitors again this year, retail analysts say.
   Results reported Thursday by several nationwide retailers
indicated women's, men's and children's clothing sold faster in
February than other goods, continuing a year-long trend.
   Kurt Barnard, a New York-based consultant, said the February
reports ``show that the American public is willing to buy provided
they're given an incentive in terms of moderate prices and exciting
merchandise displayed in a very exciting ambience.''
   Although February tends to be one of the slowest times for
shopping, analysts said the retailing results for last month looked
promising and were better than expected given current weakness in
the economy.
   ``Certainly retailing is not dead,'' said Karen Sack, an analyst
at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. in New York.
   Linda R. Morris of PNC Financial Corp. in Philadelphia said the
February figures ``signal that the consumer is continuing to spend.
Although it's not a robust retail environment, it certainly bodes
well for a decent year.''
   Among the retailers reporting Thursday were department store
groups, specialty clothing chains, discounters and mass
merchandisers.
   Other national chains posted their February results a week ago
including the nation's largest general merchandiser Sears, Roebuck
and Co., discounter Wal-Mart Stores Inc., department store operator
J.C. Penney Co. Inc. and others. Variations in fiscal-year
calendars have caused retailers to have differing sales reporting
schedules.
   Last week's reports _ with the exception of the ones from Sears
and Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. _ showed solid sales increases.
   Thomas Tashjian, an analyst at Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in
Los Angeles, noted that this year's results from the later
reporting retailers weren't exactly comparable with last year's.
Their 1990 periods ended one week later _ closer to spring _ so
they benefited more from a seasonal pickup in shopping.
   Retailers specializing in apparel fared the best. In times of
sluggish economic growth, purchases of expensive items, such as
furniture and home appliances, are typically the first things to go.
   Tashjian said apparel shoppers responded favorably to bold
prints, Chinese-look florals, short skirts for juniors, and denim
sportswear _ especially in white. Stores in malls had heavier
traffic than ones located elsewhere.
   The Limited Inc., the largest specialty apparel retailer in the
country, reported a 21 percent gain in total sales for the four
weeks ended March 3 while sales at stores open a year or longer
were up 16 percent.
   Results at stores open at least a year, called same-store or
comparable-stores sales, are considered the best reflection of a
retailer's performance. Based in Columbus, Ohio, The Limited
operates its flagship stores plus Victoria's Secret, Abercrombie &amp;
Fitch, Lane Bryant and others.
   San Francisco-based Gap Inc., another apparel retailer, said its
sales surged 29 percent while its same-store sales gained 20
percent.
   Meanwhile, May Department Stores Co., based in St. Louis, said
sales went up 10.6 percent and 7.7 percent on a comparable-store
basis. One of May's best known department store chains is Lord &amp;
Taylor.
   Dayton Hudson Corp., a Minneapolis-based owner of department
stores and the Target discount chain, said sales growth at all
three of its operating units surpassed projected levels. Total
sales rose 13.1 percent and sales at stores open at least a year
increased 6.3 percent.
   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth A. Macke said:
``These increases are strong against a solid February last year.''
   Mass merchandiser K mart Corp.'s overall results also benefited
from good gains in women's, men's and children's clothing lines.
   K mart, based in Troy, Mich., said its sales for the four weeks
ended Feb. 28 grew 14.7 percent and same-store sales were up 4.4
percent. The retailer, second in 1989 sales volume behind Sears,
also owns the Waldenbooks bookstore chain, Pay Less Drug Stores and
other chains.
   ``Strong gains were seen in ladies', men's and children's
apparel lines as good initial customer response to our early spring
merchandise contributed to the excellent sales in these
classifications,'' said Joseph E. Antonini, chairman and chief
executive officer.
   K mart recently said it is speeding up plans to open additional
stores and refurbish others as it attempts to capitalize on the
weakness at Sears and to stay ahead of fast-growing rival Wal-Mart.
Wal-Mart is widely considered a powerful contender for the No. 1
ranking in terms of annual merchandise sales revenue in the United
States. Currently, it is No. 3, but it is growing at a much faster
clip than Sears or K mart.

<TEXT>
   Debt experts testifying about junk bonds
before a House panel looked at their tea leaves and said things
will get better _ unless they get worse.
   They also suggested Congress shouldn't try to restrict junk
bonds even though they predicted more companies are likely to
default on their obligations.
   Representatives from the venerable bond rating agencies Moody's
Investors Service and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. were among the
witnesses testifying Thursday before a subcommittee of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee.
   While the credit-happy 1980s saw corporations leverage their
operations heavily by taking on ever more debt, ``deleveraging is
the future trend of the early 1990s,'' said Mark Bachman, senior
vice president of S&amp;P's corporate finance department.
   ``Unfortunately, there are reasons to be concerned that the
process of deleveraging may not proceed smoothly,'' he added. The
main reason: the economy.
   ``While a mild recession would not necessarily pose major
problems, a severe one could,'' said Bachman.
   An S&amp;P publication released earlier this week said U.S.
companies defaulted on $6 billion of publicly issued debt last
year, up from $4.4 billion in 1988. ``Annual defaults could
approach $15 billion in a difficult economic environment,'' it
predicted.
   The Congressional testimony provided a short-course in corporate
finance, especially concerning the high-yield, high-risk bonds
dubbed ``junk.''
   ``A junk bond is a shaky debt. It is the promise to pay of a
debtor who is just getting by,'' said James Grant, editor of
Grant's Interest Rate Observer.
   Most bonds are, in effect, corporate IOUs, promising to pay back
borrowed money at a later date while paying a regular, fixed
interest.
   Junk bonds, however, are considered by agencies like S&amp;P and
Moody's to be speculative, carrying a significant risk of default.
To compensate for the greater risk, they pay a much higher rate of
interest than more stable bonds.
   Proponents of junk bonds says that the high yields more than
compensate for the risk of default _ if your portfolio is
diversified.
   Pioneered by financier Michael Milken at now-defunct Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., junk bonds helped small or fledgling
companies expand and also assisted corporate raiders take over huge
corporations with little or no cash.
   But the $200 billion junk bond market has been rocked repeatedly
in recent months by Milken's indictment on racketeering charges,
corporate defaults, the withdrawal of many savings and loan
institutions as buyers and the bankruptcy filing by Drexel's parent
company.
   Thomas J. McGuire, director of Moody's corporate department,
said the default rate for junk bonds has risen to 5.4 percent,
``the second-highest rate since 1970. And the outlook _ given the
increase in lower rated issuers and the potentially unfavorable
economic environment _ is for still higher levels of defaults in
the early 1990s.''
   ``A jittery market and the self-destruction of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Group have raised new questions about the role of junk
bonds in our economy,'' said Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., chairman
of the telecommunications and finance subcommittee.
   ``Is there anything for Congress to do about this?'' Markey
asked.
   Not necessarily, economists said.
   ``Legislation is more likely to worsen than help the problem,''
said David A. Wyss, chief financial economist for DRI-McGraw-Hill.
   ``Leverage is a response to the incentives in the tax law, and
unless those incentives change, attacking the symptoms will just
cause problems elsewhere,'' he said.
   Moreover, Wyss said, ``If investors can hold on to the bonds for
an extended period, riding through the current storm, we believe
their patience will be rewarded.''
   ``The junk bond problem is really a junk credit problem,'' said
Grant, a prominent critic of the growth of debt in recent years.
``In the 1980s we had an explosion of the credit supply.''
   With the junk market battered by the developments of recent
months, ``I would advise the subcommittee to be wary of pushing the
market toward even greater stringency,'' Grant said.

<HEAD>Government Sending ``Death Threats'' To Futures Markets: CBOT's
Mahlmann</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government plans to increase taxes and
regulation on futures trading are ``death threats'' that could
imperil the industry, the head of the world's biggest futures
exchange says.
   In a speech Thursday to the annual meeting of the Futures
Industry Association, Chicago Board of Trade Chairman Karsten
Mahlmann said America's share of worldwide futures trading volume
has dropped by 17.5 percent over the last five years.
   Proposals to restrict and tax futures trading will make overseas
exchanges even more attractive, he said.
   During a panel discussion, Mahlmann and officials of the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange and the New York Mercantile Exchange complained
about several proposals including:
   _ A plan by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to restrict
dual trading;
   _ A Bush administration proposal for an 11-cent fee on every
futures trade to fund increased CFTC surveillance of futures
markets;
   _ A push by the Securities and Exchange Commission to gain
regulatory authority over stock-index futures, a market that is now
regulated by the CFTC.
   The proposals grew out of the federal investigation of futures
trading fraud in Chicago and the stock market crash of October 1987.
   Mahlmann said he, too, is seeking ``a healthier environment in
which to conduct business,'' but ``one in which we can work with
our regulators rather than one in which we stand the distinct
possibility of being killed.''
   Chicago Mercantile Exchange President William Brodsky and New
York Mercantile Exchange Chairman Lou Gutterman also lashed out at
the CFTC's dual-trading proposal.
   Brodsky told CFTC Chairman Wendy Gramm, who also sat on the
discussion panel, ``in this particular case, you used a
sledgehammer instead of a scapel.''
   Mrs. Gramm avoided the dual-trading controversy in her remarks.
Instead, she urged the industry to fight harder to keep regulation
of stock-index futures under the CFTC's jurisdiction and away from
the SEC.
   The SEC, which oversees stock trading, has been gaining
congressional support for its view that the stock and stock-index
futures markets are so closely linked that they should be regulated
by one agency.
   Dual trading is the practice among floor brokers of trading for
their own accounts after executing any orders from their public
customers.
   Critics contend dual trading enables floor brokers to take
advantageous market positions ahead of large customer orders that
they know are likely to move prices. That illegal practice, known
as front-running, is among the fraud schemes alleged in the
indictments of 48 traders at the Board of Trade and the Chicago
Merc.
   But futures exchange officials maintain that dual trading
increases the efficiency of their markets by increasing the number
of buyers and sellers.
   Since November, the CFTC has been gathering public comments on
its proposals for a test ban on dual trading in selected markets
regardless of the exchanges' ability to detect fraud.
   The CFTC plan is based on an agency study that found no
statistical support for the exchanges' claims that dual trading
increases market liquidity.
   Exchange officials involved in the panel discussion cited other
studies that dispute the CFTC's findings.
   Mahlmann said the Board of Trade opposes any restrictions on
dual trading. Even so, he said, the CFTC proposal is especially
galling.
   ``The CFTC plan to ban dual trading has no basis in fact,'' he
said. ``It appears to be designed for the sake of political
expediency rather than logic.''
   The Chicago Merc has voluntarily restricted dual trading in one
of its most active markets, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock-index
futures pit.
   Brodsky said the Merc supports a CFTC reauthorization bill
passed last year by the House of Representatives that would ban
dual trading in the most active futures markets but would allow it
to resume at exchanges that have a failsafe system for detecting
abuses. A similar measure is pending in the Senate.
   The Merc and the Board of Trade are working together to develop
an ``electronic trading card'' that would replace the paper cards
on which traders record their trades. Such a system, the exchanges
say, would create a foolproof means of detecting dual-trading
abuses.

<HEAD>Replacements Likely To Make Greyhound Strike Harder To End,
Experts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greyhound Lines Inc.'s hiring of replacements for
its striking bus drivers reflects a trend toward tougher management
stances in labor squabbles, and some experts say the hardball
tactics will make it harder to settle the week-old walkout.
   Hiring replacements ``is far different from the old strikes we
used to have,'' said Mark Kahn, a labor arbitrator and professor
emeritus at Wayne State University in Detroit.
   In the past, he said, there has been ``a clear-cut understanding
that whenever the dispute is ironed out, those workers will go back
to work and the company will resume its operations. That tends to
create a relatively civilized atmosphere in which answers can be
worked out.''
   Replacements are ``indicative of some of the more bitter,
confrontational disputes that we are seeing,'' said Mike Jadell, an
arbitrator and a professor at Georgia State University in Atlanta.
   ``It's become an additional tool in the arsenal of those
employers who feel that they are in adversarial relationships,'' he
said.
   Some labor experts trace the confrontational approach to the
start of the pro-business Reagan administration and its decision in
1981 to fire striking air traffic controllers and replace them with
new hires.
   Greyhound's strategy is similar to that of Eastern Airlines,
which sought to rebuild as a smaller carrier with lower costs by
hiring new, non-union workers after its machinists, pilots and
flight attendants struck a year ago.
   ``We don't have a lot of options,'' said P. Anthony Lannie,
Greyhound's executive vice president and chief negotiator. ``This
union has us backed into a corner.''
   The at-times violent strike began early March 2 when the
Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions and the company
failed to reach agreement on a new three-year contract. The union
represents 9,435 of Greyhound's 11,825 employees, including 6,300
drivers, 1,600 office workers and 1,475 maintenance workers.
   The company says it can afford no more than its original $63
million offer; the union says its last proposal is less than
Greyhound's, but the company values it at $205 million.
   There has been little contact between the two sides since,
although federal mediators Thursday asked for a fact-finding
meeting with the union next week followed by a similar session with
the company.
   Greyhound has been operating at reduced levels since the strike,
using replacements hired and trained in the last two weeks plus any
union members who cross picket lines.
   Lannie said Thursday 800 permanent replacements, plus an
additional 368 union drivers, are behind the wheels of the
company's buses. The company says it received more than 6,500
applications for jobs and will be able to operate a full schedule
by the end of the month.
   In other words, ``a total of 3,468 of the most junior people
that are striking right now do not have jobs,'' he said.
   Because demand is expected to be lower immediately after the
strike, Lannie said the company will need fewer drivers initially,
leaving only about 2,000 regular, full-time openings left to be
filled.
   The union has vowed to regain the jobs for its members.
   ``When management is prepared to enter into good faith
negotiations, their union will ensure that their jobs and seniority
are secured,'' said union spokesman Jeffrey Nelson.
   The management team that took over the only nationwide bus
service three years ago is taking a much harsher stance than its
predecessors.
   In a 47-day walkout in 1983, Greyhound _ then owned by
Phoenix-based conglomerate Greyhound Corp. _ hired replacements
during the strike but then fired them to make room for returning
union members.
   Experts say the company's new position is bolstered by events
since then, including a Supreme Court decision last year concerning
a strike against Trans World Airlines Inc. That decision upheld a
company's right to keep union members who crossed pickets lines,
Lannie said.
   Most companies have had the right to hire replacements for
decades, although few exercised it, Kahn said.
   ``It's a very contentious issue,'' he said. ``It's a way an
employer can beat the strike, but it's the antithesis of sensible
and rational efforts to resolve the dispute.
   ``The outcome's got to be very bad, especially for the employees
who lose their jobs.''
   The use of replacements also raises the stakes for the union, he
said, and ``makes it far more difficult for the union to agree to a
settlement under which many of its members won't come back to
work.''
   Two bills have been introduced in Congress that would limit the
use of permanent replacements, but Kahn and others doubted they
would pass.
   Just Wednesday, the House failed to override President Bush's
veto of a bill to create a commission on the year-old Eastern
Airlines strike.
   Replacement workers also have been used International Paper Co.,
Boise Cascade, Phelps Dodge and Eastern's sister carrier,
Continental Airlines.
   Charles M. Rehmus, a labor law professor at the University of
San Diego, said it was the 1981 air controllers strike that gave
replacements legitimacy.
   ``It encouraged employers generally to operate through a strike
and employees to cross picket lines,'' he said.

   American Express Co. has labeled ``totally
without merit'' a series of class-action lawsuits by Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. shareholders charging the two firms with setting
low a price in a huge stock buyback.
   One lawsuit filed in Delaware Chancery Court claims the buyback
price of $12.50 per Shearson share _ little more than one-third the
price at which American Express sold the shares to the public three
years ago _ is ``grossly unfair.'' It claimed the stock is below
its true value because of recent problems at the firm.
   American Express announced earlier this week it was purchasing
the publicly held shares of its ailing securities unit as part of a
plan that included a management overhaul, 2,000 layoffs this month
and a $1 billion capital infusion.
   American Express initially had sought to reduce its 61 percent
stake in Shearson. The lawsuit claims that the company timed its
reversal ``in an effort to cap the market at its currently
depressed level.''
   American Express officials said a total of about 20 class-action
lawsuits had been filed in Delaware and New York courts.
   ``We have reviewed several of the original complaints and we
believe them to be totally without merit,'' American Express
spokesman Lawrence Armour said Thursday. He added that the lawsuits
were expected to be consolidated into one complaint in each state.
   Under the proposed buyback, which must be approved by a special
committee of three outside Shearson directors, American Express
will exchange $350 million of its own shares for 28 million
publicly held Shearson shares, or 32 percent of the firm.
   Each outstanding share of Shearson will be exchanged for 0.426
of a share of American Express. The deal is based on March 2
closing New York Stock Exchange prices of $12.50 a share for
Shearson and $29.37{ for American Express.
   Shares of both companies have fallen since, with Shearson
closing down 12{ cents at $11.75 Thursday and American Express
unchanged at $27.87{. At that price, the stock swap would value
Shearson at $11.87{ a share.
   Shearson shares were offered to the public at $34 each in March
1987. The complaints claim the American Express buyback undervalues
the firm's assets and potential worth.
   Lawsuits say American Express violated a duty to shareholders to
maximize the value of the firm. They claim the offer price was not
based on an evaluation of the company or on negotiations, and
therefore was unfair to shareholders.
   One lawsuit claims American Express used ``coercive and
manipulative practices'' in a scheme to eliminate minority
shareholders. Another says Shearson is ``poised for future growth
and earnings'' that public shareholders will miss out.
   The lawsuits ask the courts to stop or reverse the stock buyback
or award damages to shareholders.
   A suit made public Thursday in Delaware, where Shearson is
incorporated, claims that Primerica Corp. offered to invest $900
million in exchange for a 40 percent stake in Shearson during talks
that ended last week without a deal and preceded the stock buyback
proposal.
   No figures about the negotiations with Primerica, which is
headed by former Shearson and American Express executive Sanford I.
Weill, have been released by the companies.
   But individuals with knowledge of the talks said the $900
million figure represented not an offer price but an estimated
value of Primerica's Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. unit, which
would have been merged with Shearson.
   Weill also offered to buy all of Shearson, but Shearson's new
chairman, Howard L. Clark Jr., former chief financial officer of
American Express, opposed the deal, according to the lawsuit.

<HEAD>Suit Accuses Burger King of Violating Child Labor Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stunned by allegations of child labor law
violations, Burger King Corp. said it maintains strict policies
regarding young employees but will review work rules in its U.S.
restaurants.
   An executive at the nation's No. 2 fast-food chain called the
government suit ``a complete surprise'' and vowed to look into the
charges.
   ``This is the first time we have received any indication of
alleged violations,'' said Nigel Travis, senior vice president for
human resources at the company.
   ``We fully support the spirit and letter of the law,'' he added.
   Burger King, a subsidiary of Britain's Grand Metropolitan PLC,
was charged in a lawsuit Wednesday with violating federal child
labor laws in its more than 800 company-owned restaurants in the
United States.
   It was the first major suit since Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole
last month announced a campaign for tougher enforcement of
regulations on young workers.
   ``This action serves as a notice to employers that we will not
hesitate to use available legal processes, in addition to
investigative efforts, to protect America's children,'' Mrs. Dole
said Thursday.
   The suit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court, claims
Miami-based Burger King assigned workers under 16 to more hours per
week than permitted under federal laws and allowed the young
employees to work at times of the day not allowed under the Fair
Labor Standards Act.
   The U.S. Deparment of Labor suit also claims Burger King had
workers under 16 handling prohibited duties, such as most cooking
and baking activities.
   Violations extend back to at least Sept. 12, 1986, the suit
claims. But no charges were made against Burger King's nearly 4,600
U.S. franchise outlets, which are independently owned and operated.
Burger King has about 6,000 restaurants worldwide.
   Federal officials say the number of child labor violations has
doubled since 1982 as worker shortages in some areas pushed
employers to hire more high school-age employees.
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated about 901,000 14- and
15-year-olds were employed in 1988. Numbers for last year have not
been released.
   Under federal laws, 14- and 15-year-olds can't work more than
three hours on a day when school is in session and a maximum of 18
hours during a five-day school week. On weekends, an eight-hour
work day is permissible, and a 40-hour work week is allowed during
summer and school vacations.
   Employees under 16 can work only between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. or up
to 9 p.m. from June 1 to Labor Day.
   Different standards apply for farm labor.
   The suit seeks to enjoin Burger King from all child labor law
violations in its U.S. restaurants. It also asks the company to pay
all legal costs associated with the suit.
   Civil fines for violations are assessed in separate proceedings,
but the Labor Department would not disclose whether any action has
been taken, said spokesman Dan Fuqua in Atlanta.

   GAF Corp., facing up to $4 million in fines
on a criminal conviction for stock manipulation, has agreed to pay
$1.25 million plus interest to settle related civil charges
involving the trading of Union Carbide Corp. stock.
   GAF and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin, did not admit or
deny allegations in the civil complaint, which alleged that it
manipulated the price of Union Carbide stock in 1986.
   The chemical manufacturer and Sherwin were to be sentenced today
in New York for their criminal conviction.
   Sherwin, 56, faces up to 40 years in prison and up to $2 million
in fines, but a jail term is not expected to approach the maximum
term.
   GAF, a New Jersey-based chemical and building materials
manufacturer, could be fined as much as $4 million. As a convicted
felon, it also could be forced to sell its classical radio station
in New York City, WNCN-FM.
   Under the civil settlement filed Thursday in federal court in
Washington, D.C., GAF and Sherwin consented to injunctions that
prevented them from manipulating stock.
   The company agreed to pay $1.25 million plus interest dating
from Oct. 30, 1986, to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
funds will be placed in escrow for investors who were affected by
GAF's actions, SEC enforcement division attorney Kevin McEnery said.
   ``The settlement was made with the SEC in order to resolve this
matter promptly and avoid protracted and costly litigation,'' GAF
said in a statement. Company officials declined to comment further.
   The SEC and a federal grand jury accused Sherwin and GAF of
manipulating the price of Union Carbide stock in collaboration with
former stockbroker Boyd L. Jefferies in October 1986. They sought
to push up the share price before selling a large block GAF had
amassed in a failed takeover attempt, the complaint alleged.
   After two mistrials, GAF and Sherwin were convicted in Manhattan
federal court in December of eight counts of stock manipulation,
securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy. Two GAF subsidiaries
were acquitted.
   The conviction marked the first time that a company off Wall
Street was convicted in the government's insider trading
investigation that stemmed from disclosures by former stock
speculator Ivan Boesky, who paid $100 million in fines and was
sentenced to three years in prison.
   Lawyers for Sherwin and GAF have said they plan to appeal.
   The case initially attracted wide attention as the first
criminal trial in the government's securities fraud and insider
trading crackdown in the 1980s, but dragged on through 1989 and was
upstaged by other cases.
   In the case, Jefferies testified he agreed to bid up the price
of Union Carbide at Sherwin's request. GAF was trying to sell five
million Union Carbide shares after the takeover for the larger
chemicals concern failed.
   The SEC said the $1.25 million represents ``certain benefits
received by GAF as a result of purchases of Union Carbide stock by
Jefferies &amp; Co.,'' Jefferies securities firm.
   The government alleged that Sherwin and Jefferies agreed to have
Jefferies close the price of the common stock of Union Carbide at
$22 or higher, and Sherwin agreed to compensate Jefferies for any
losses.
   Testimony showed Jefferies &amp; Co. bought 190,100 shares of Union
Carbide on Oct. 29 and 30, which helped raise the stock price 12.5
cents to $22, and sold the stock a week later for a reported loss
of $40,000. GAF later sold five million Carbide shares for $23 to
Salomon Brothers Inc.
   Jefferies was forced to resign from his company after pleading
guilty to two securities law violations. He named GAF as part of
his cooperation with federal prosecutors, received a suspended
sentence and was fined $250,000 last year.

<HEAD>London Shares Lower At Midday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices were lower at midday Friday amid
investor caution about the pound's weakness.
   Political turmoil in the British government over the new poll
tax weakened the currency, which in turn impacted the stock market,
traders said.
   In addition, a rumor that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had
resigned, since denied, contributed to dampening market sentiment,
they said.
   Prices advanced strongly in the opening minutes of trading, then
quickly collapsed as the pound was hit with a wave of selling.
   The sterling's losses were checked by intervention from the Bank
of England, but not before the pound had lost 2 cents from its
levels at the opening of the European day to fall to around its
current level of $1.6245.
   ``The minute sterling came under pressure, trading stopped,''
said a dealer with the London investment firm Hoare Govett Ltd.
   At about 12:15 p.m. London time, the Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index was down 13.2 points, or 0.6 percent, at
2,236.8.
   The market had been as high as 2,263.3 when trading officially
opened at 9 a.m.
   Volume improved to 330.3 million shares by midday, compared with
247.9 million shares at the same time Thursday.
   Even so, ``it's still pretty lame,'' said Jonathan Hill, a
director of the London investment firm Henderson Crosthwaite and Co.

<HEAD>CBS To Pay More Than $1 Billion Over Four Years For NFL Contract</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HAL BOCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Sports Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Football League seems to be living
proof that the rich keep getting richer.
   The league's television income soared to nearly $3 billion on
Thursday when CBS agreed to a four-year contract that maintains its
Sunday NFL package. The deal, which cost the network $1.06 billion,
or $265 million a year, includes rights to the 1992 Super Bowl in
Minneapolis.
   ``We are tremendously pleased to continue our 34-year
association with the NFL and NFC games,'' CBS Sports president Neal
Pilson said. ``Retaining our Sunday package was a key element in
our long-term corporate strategy of providing broadcast coverage of
dominant sports franchises.''
   No matter, apparently, what it costs.
   Pilson had previously dipped into the CBS coffers for $1.06
billion for four years of baseball, $1 billion for seven years of
the NCAA basketball tournament and $543 million for the next two
Winter Olympics.
   The CBS contract followed the NFL's $900 million deal with ABC
for the Monday night package, an extra tier of playoff games which
the league provided, and the silver anniversary Super Bowl at Tampa
in 1991.
   As appetizers for those two fancy network agreements, NFL
commissioner Paul Tagliabue and his television negotiators
completed twin $450 million cable contracts with ESPN and TBS for
Sunday night games.
   Still to be heard from is NBC, locked in negotiations for its
piece of the NFL pie following expiration of its three-year, $360
million deal.
   Including the NBC pact, which the Wall Street Journal reported
could be signed as early as today, the NFL could reap some $3.6
billion in total for four years of television rights _ a 90 percent
jump over the annual cost of the previous football contracts.
   Consider the increases in fees the league has already forged.
Under its previous deal, ABC paid $120 million a year. That's gone
up to $237.5 million per year in the new contract.
   CBS previously had a three-year, $450 million contract. The
price tag on the current contract amounts to a 76 percent increase.
   ESPN was paying $150 million for 24 regular season games and
three Pro Bowls. Now, with TBS added to the equation, cable
television antes up six times that figure.

<HEAD>Unemployment Dipped To 8.6 Percent in January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The average unemployment rate in the 12
European Community nations dipped to 8.6 percent in January from
8.7 percent in December, the EC statistics agency said Friday.
   Henning Christophersen, EC commissioner for the economy, said
``two very positive trends can be drawn from the recent
unemployment statistics. First, unemployment is now falling or
static in all Member States, and second, youth unemployment is
falling even faster.''
   The unemployment rate for people under 25 has fallen almost one
percent over the last six months dropping from 17.2 percent to 16.3
percent. This compares with a more modest drop in unemployment as a
whole from 8.9 to 8.6 percent over the same period.
   Unemployment was highest in Ireland where 16.7 percent of the
potential work force was out of work in January. Spain also has a
high unemployment rate at 15.9 percent. Luxembourg, with only 1.8
percent of its work force out of a job, had the lowest rate,
followed by Portugal at 4.9 percent.
   Rates in other countries were: Belgium, 9.1 percent; Denmark,
6.4 percent; West Germany, 5.4 percent; France, 9.4 percent; Italy,
10.9 percent; Netherlands, 9.0 percent; Britain, 6.1 percent.
Figures for Greece were unavailable.
   Christophersen said the Community had ``the possibility over a
few years to eliminate mass unemployment as we have known it since
the end of the 70s, particularly against the background of both the
coordinated economic policy mix in the Member States and in the
light of the events and opening markets of Central and Eastern
Europe.''

   Carl Icahn plans to spend as much as $10
million on a campaign to convince USX Corp. shareholders that
everyone will benefit from his proposal to sell the company's steel
division.
   ``I feel it's very compelling, and I certainly hope they will,''
he said in a telephone interview. ``I feel it will not only enhance
shareholder value but also be good for other constituencies.''
   Icahn's proposal will be put to a non-binding shareholder vote
under an agreement announced Thursday.
   In exchange for the vote, Icahn, USX's biggest shareholder,
agreed not to wage a proxy fight or submit other matters for
consideration at the steel, oil and gas giant's May 7 annual
meeting, USX said.
   Stockholders will be asked whether USX should incorporate a
separate steel business and spin off at least 80 percent of it,
Icahn said in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The new company would carry no more than $1.5 billion
in long-term debt.
   Icahn, chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc., said in the filing
he will spend $5 million to $10 million on the campaign to persuade
shareholders.
   USX, which will not be bound by the outcome, said in a statement
it opposes the resolution as not in the best interest of
stockholders but would ``give due consideration to the results of
such vote in determining its future course of action.''
   USX stock rose $1 to $36.62{ a share Thursday in heavy trading
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Under a bylaw amendment approved by the company's board in
January, Icahn was required to tell USX by the close of business
Thursday whether he would nominate his own slate of directors at
the annual meeting.
   Icahn owns nearly 34 million, or 13.26 percent, of the company's
outstanding common shares. He has long been unhappy with USX
management and believes the company's stock price is too low.
   Icahn had argued in favor of the sale of USX's Marathon Oil &amp;
Gas subsidiary, which USX management does not want to sell.
   In 1988, he waged an unsuccessful proxy battle at Texaco Inc.,
hoping to unseat the oil company's board and force a restructuring
to boost Texaco's stock price.
   Charles A. Bradford, a steel industry analyst, said this may be
a bad time to sell the steel division, known as U.S. Steel.
   ``It would be quite difficult to get a good value for the steel
division today with the state of the stock market today, he said.
   Bradford said potential buyers could be scared off by USX's $5.7
billion long-term debt.
   About 65 percent of USX's revenues comes from its energy
division, while about 31 percent comes from steel, USX spokesman
William Keslar said.
   The steel division's operating income totaled $430 million in
1989, compared with $501 million in 1988. The reduced income was
due partly to the sale of the Lorain, Ohio, steel works to a 50
percent-owned joint venture in the second quarter of 1989.
   The annual meeting will be held at Marathon's headquarters in
Findlay, Ohio.

   Senate leaders today abandoned efforts to
complete key parts of a clean air bill before an upcoming weeklong
recess after a dispute emerged over whether the government should
provide $700 million in assistance to coal miners.
   The coal miner assistance proposal, aimed at helping workers who
lose their jobs because of tougher acid rain emission controls,
threatened a compromise agreement on clean air legislation with the
White House, which has vigorously opposed the measure as being too
expensive.
   ``It has become apparent that we cannot complete action on the
bill ... this week,'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine. He said he expected the remainder of the day to focus
primarily on the coal miner assistance proposal.
   Senate leaders had been prepared Thursday night to bring the
amendment, offered by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., to a vote, but
when debate dragged beyond midnight action was postponed.
   Mitchell said negotiations were under way with the White House
to attempt to work out an agreement. But he said he was opposed to
the assistance plan and said he accepts the view of Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., that the issue could scuttle the
compromise agreement with the Bush administration.
   The delay on the Byrd amendment prompted speculation that
Mitchell did not have the votes to block the proposal. Mitchell
told reporters today he did not know what the vote count was.
   Mitchell had threatened all week to hold the senators in session
into Saturday if necessary to work out key provisions of the clean
air legislation. But he said today that a list of remaining
amendments would be assembled for action after Senate returns March
20 after its weeklong recess.
   He said he did not anticipate action on other major amendments,
including several strengthening auto pollution control proposals,
until the coal miner issue was resolved.
   Byrd called the measure a ``safety net'' for as many as 5,000
miners who will lose their jobs because stringent controls on
sulfur dioxide will force Midwest utilities to shift to other than
high-sulfur coal to power their plants.
   The amendment was one of several before the Senate that
conflicts with the compromise agreement reached last month between
Senate leaders and the White House on the scope of the air
pollution control bill. The administration has been adamant in
opposing provisions that would increase the expense of the
legislation, which in its present form would cost the economy about
$21 billion a year.
   Earlier Thursday, the Senate in a 66-33 vote rejected an
amendment to require additional toxic emission controls on
automobiles. Senate leaders called it a ``deal breaker'' because of
strong opposition by the White House, which objected to its
reported $1.5 billion price tag.
   But the Byrd coal miner ``safety net'' amendment prompted the
strongest debate and behind-the-scenes maneuvering.
   ``If this amendment is passed, it's over,'' declared Sen. Bob
Dole, R-Kan., referring to the Byrd proposal. ``The administration
doesn't like this amendment one bit and that would be an
understatement.''
   Mitchell said discussions were continuing with the White House
on a compromise that would satisfy both the administration and Byrd
and clear the way for a vote on the proposal today.
   The clean air measure represents the first tightening of federal
air pollution control laws in 13 years. It calls for sweeping curbs
on smog-causing pollution from automobiles and industrial plants
and requires new cuts in acid rain pollutants from coal-fired
electric power plants.
   A similar bill remains in committee in the House.
   Byrd, who for many years when he was majority leader blocked
acid rain legislation to protect West Virginia miners, had been
seeking $1.3 billion to provide miners who lose jobs because of the
new pollution controls with full or partial salaries for six years.
He later cut back the proposal to four years, with an estimated
cost of $700 million.
   The senator argued that his proposal was no different than the
federal government's bailout of New York City, its assistance
program for railroaders after the Penn Central went bankrupt, or
federal aid to victims of the San Francisco earthquake and
Hurricane Hugo.
   ``A disaster is a disaster and I'm talking about a disaster that
is going to hit the coal fields,'' Byrd told his colleagues.
   But Dole and other senators said that if the coal miners are
helped, so should workers in other industries who might lose their
jobs because of the sweeping pollution controls envisioned by the
clean air bill.

<HEAD>White House Denies Report That Bush Upset at Fed Chief</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House today denied a report that
President Bush is unlikely to reappoint Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan when his term expires in August 1991 because of
Greenspan's refusal to push interest rates down further.
   The Los Angeles Times today quoted an unidentified longtime Bush
adviser as saying the president is ``mad as hell'' about
Greenspan's position on interest rates and will seek a new Fed
chief.
   ``I deny the story,'' Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said at
the regular White House briefing. ``We're not angry.''
   Also at the briefing was Michael Boskin, chairman of the
president's Council of Economic Advisers, who said of the story:
``It's out of left field.''
   Boskin said ``there hasn't been any discussion'' about whether
Bush should reappoint Greenspan.
   ``I have not even begun to think about that issue nor, do I
think, has the president,'' Boskin said.
   ``The president and Chairman Greenspan as well as (Treasury)
Secretary Brady and myself and others in the administration have
good working relations with the Federal Reserve,'' Boskin said.
   The administration has on occassion publicly called for lower
interest rates, comments widely interpreted as an attempt to
pressure the Fed to ease monetary policy as part of an effort to
spark the economy, which since last year has shown signs of
weakness.
   Greenspan told Congress two weeks ago that the threat of
recession has faded and that he was unlikely to encourage rates to
fall, a move that could push inflation higher.

   Futures prices for soybeans and corn were mostly
higher, with wheat lower in early trading today on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Lower-than-expected figures in a private planting service report
issued Thursday and an active soymeal cash market overnight in
Europe supported soybean futures, analysts said.
   Corn was simply following soybeans higher, while wheat prices
were depressed by rain forecasts for this weekend over U.S. growing

   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, pork futures were mostly

   In early trading, cattle were .12 cent lower to .30 cent higher,
with the contract for delivery in April at 77.50 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .05 cent higher, with March at

<HEAD>Soviet Union Submits Formal Request for Observer Status</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has formally applied for observer
status with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a spokesman
for the 96-nation world trade forum said Friday.
   David Woods said Evgeny Makeyev, Soviet ambassador in Geneva,
submitted the application Thursday and asked that the request be
considered at the next GATT Council meeting scheduled for April 3.
   Observer status would enable the Soviet Union to examine GATT
and the preconditions for full membership, while also keeping
trading partners up to date with Moscow's economic restructuring
program, Woods said.
   Members of the market-orientated organization, which draws up
agreements to liberalize global commerce and mediates trade
disputes, account for more than four-fifths of world trade.
   Diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity said there was
wide support for Moscow to become involved in GATT before the end
of the year. But they added the application was unlikely to be
approved as quickly as next month.
   Although observer status would not automatically entitle the
Soviet Union to multilateral trading concessions enjoyed by full
GATT members, it would give Moscow first-hand knowledge of changes
in the world trading system. Such information is necessary to back
up Soviet economic and trade reforms.
   But the Soviet Union would not be privy to talks on
comprehensive new agreements to liberalize trade in areas such as
agriculture and textiles that are being drawn up as part of the
ambitious Uruguay Round of negotiations scheduled to end in
December.
   Around 30 countries are observers at GATT, including China,
which is seeking full membership.
   At last December's Malta summit U.S. President George Bush said
he would back Moscow's bid for observer status. The United States
had previously opposed any Soviet involvement on the grounds that
the Soviet economic system was incompatible with GATT's free trade
principles.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Lampoon Inc., the magazine publisher
and movie producer, has agreed to be acquired by J2 Communications
in a stock swap valued at approximately $4.67 million, the
companies announced today.
   J2, a home video producer and distributor, will exchange
two-thirds of a share of its common stock plus a warrant expected
to be worth $1 for each share of National Lampoon stock, the
companies said in a statement.
   J2's shares, which did not immediately begin trading at the
opening of the over-the-counter market today, closed at $3 on
Thursday. National Lampoon also did not begin trading immediately
today after closing at $3.50 a share Thursday.
   Actor Tim Matheson and his business partner, Daniel Grodnik, who
acquired a controlling stake in National Lampoon last year, will
continue to run the company as a division of J2.
   James P. Jimirro, J2's president and chief executive, said the
acquisition would give National Lampoon, which has been losing
money, capital for its publishing and movie projects.
   Last month, National Lampoon reported a third-quarter loss of
$435,300 on revenue of $1.38 million. For the first nine months of
the year, the company reported a loss of $915,000 on revenue of
$3.8 million.
   National Lampoon publishes National Lampoon magazine and
produces movies. Its most recent hit was ``National Lampoon's
Christmas Vacation.''
   J2 is an independent producer of home videos.
   The deal announced today must be approved by shareholders of
both companies.
   Matheson and Grodnik took control of National Lampoon _ which
had been running in the red for some time _ from its founder Matty
Simmons. Matheson appeared as the college Don Juan in National
Lampoon's first hit film, ``Animal House,'' in 1978.

<HEAD>Leo Melamed Trading Up and Out of Futures Leadership</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was an unlikely snapshot of Chicago
Mercantile Exchange chief Leo Melamed, sauntering past a turquoise
swimming pool sporting a black silk shirt and pale yellow slacks.
   He was smiling and tossing a small package, perhaps a giveaway
from a vendor at the Futures Industry Association convention in the
sprawling pink Boca Raton Hotel.
   Melamed is known more for operating in hyperdrive, whether he's
proclaiming the global importance of the financial futures he
fathered, defending his industry against critics, creating new
worlds of science fiction or imagining new ways of managing risk.
   Trader, lawyer, author, visionary _ Leo Melamed is considered
the renaissance man of the futures markets, once the domain of pork
farmers and grain merchants.
   His surprise retirement at year's end from the dual role of
special counsel to the Merc and chairman of the board's executive
committee will leave a void in the leadership of an industry
fighting to preserve turf and reputation.
   ``Time will allow us to find other people,'' Melamed said when
he announced his retirement March 5. ``They're around and they will
come forward.''
   Even his main competitor, Chicago Board of Trade Chairman
Karsten Mahlmann, says Melamed's contributions will be missed: ``If
he wants to become more of a private citizen, the whole industry
will feel his loss.''
   Melamed, graying but fit-looking at 57, says his only plans are
to write memoirs, publish a sequel to his science-fiction novel
``The Tenth Planet,'' do some trading and spend more time with his
family.
   But he is not likely to stroll far from the scuffling heart of
the markets he nurtured.
   Robert Wilmouth, president of the National Futures Association,
an industry-funded watchdog agency that Melamed helped found in
1982, predicts that if the industry needs someone to lead it
through tomorrow's thickets, Leo ``is going to be holding the
light.''
   Melamed said he will be around to offer advice and, when pressed
on possible career moves, said: ``I'll see what comes along the
way.''
   His most notable achievement was the creation in the early 1970s
of financial futures contracts, risk-management tools used by large
institutional investors around the world. Pension funds, banks,
even governments rely on Melamed's invention to lock in returns on
stocks, bonds and currency trades.
   These high-finance instruments are traded exactly the same way
as pork belly and soybean futures from Chicago to Sydney: traders
crowd pits, yell bids and furiously flash hand signals.
   It is raucous, adrenalin-pumping and confounding. It is, Melamed
said in a speech last week at the convention, ``an industry I loved
from the very first moment that, by sheer accident, I came upon
it.''
   That was around 1953 when Melamed, son of Polish immigrant
schoolteachers, took a job at the Merc as a runner for Merrill
Lynch to earn his way through law school.
   Egg futures were the Merc's main product line then. But as he
rose from runner to trader to chairman in 1969, Melamed saw a
dead-end in limiting futures trading to the world of basic
commodities.
   He saw an opportunity to exploit fluctuations in currency
exchange rates, freed to float by an international agreement in
1971.
   A disciple of economist Milton Friedman's free-market
philosophy, Melamed envisioned a market for international currency
futures, where you could ensure a guaranteed price in yen for your
dollars, or pounds for your francs. He took his idea to Washington.
   There, at 33, Melamed called on then Treasury Secretary George
Shultz, Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns and Alan Greenspan,
then head of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, for
reaction.
   They liked it, he said. In Greenspan's office, ``I suggested
that the markets we were creating in Chicago might be beneficial to
the American economy. In an instant, he stood up from his desk and
literally reeled off a litany of uses that I had never dreamed
possible for futures markets in Treasury bills, certificates of
deposit, T-bonds and the like.''
   The Merc launched its first currency futures contracts in 1972,
when annual U.S. futures trading volume totaled 18.3 million
contracts.
   Last year, more than 267 million futures contracts were traded
on U.S. exchanges, and more than 60 percent were products such as
currency, bond and stock-index futures.
   Melamed's biggest project in recent years has been guiding the
development of Globex, an electronic trading system that he sees
linking U.S., European and Far Eastern financial markets to create
a 24-hour exchange. He expects it to begin operation by midyear.
   Melamed's creations have not been free of controversy.
Stock-index futures, for example, which allow investors to control
large amounts of stock at low cost, have been blamed by some
experts for volatility in the stock market.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission appears to be advancing
in its quest to wrest regulatory control over index futures away
from the less intrusive Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Melamed finds the prospect distasteful, though he's willing to
compromise; others in the futures industry abhor it, fearing the
SEC will regulate them out of business.
   In another blow to the industry, 26 traders from the Merc's
Japanese yen and Swiss franc pits were among 48 people indicted
last year on fraud charges stemming from an FBI sting operation at
the Merc and the Board of Trade.
   But Melamed has not been sullied. He was praised by Washington
and the industry for quickly responding to the crisis.
   ``If I were to do it all over again,'' he said, ``this is what I
would do and that is how I would do it and I would regret nothing
along the way.''

   The stock market headed lower today in an
unenthusiastic response to stronger-than-expected employment news.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 6.53 to 2,689.64

suggesting that the economy had regained more momentum than many

   That was interpreted as a plus for the outlook for corporate

   Reckitt and Colman PLC, a British food and
household goods group, has agreed to pay $1.25 billion for the
Boyle-Midway home products unit of New York-based American Home
Products Corp., the companies said today.
   The acquisition of Boyle-Midway, whose products include Woolite
laundry soap and Easy-Off oven cleaner, would make Reckitt and
Colman a major international household products manufacturer.
   Boyle-Midway is about half the size of Reckitt and Colman's
household products and toiletries division. Boyle-Midway had $667
million in sales last year in the United States, Canada, France,
West Germany and Spain and a pretax profit of $91 million, the
companies said.
   Similar Reckitt and Colman businesses had pre-tax profit of 117
million pounds, or $191 million, on sales of 817 million pounds, or
$1.3 billion, last year.
   The move ``will result in a major increase in the size and scope
of Reckitt and Colman's business in North America and Continental
Europe,'' the British company said.
   Analysts said they had been expecting Reckitt and Colman to make
either a single major purchase or a string of acquisitions in
household goods.
   Such a move is necessary ``if it wants to make double-digit
growth'' in the years ahead, said Steve Plag, an analyst at the
London investment firm Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd.
   The groups' existing products, which range from mustards to home
cleaning products, are in mature, slower growing sectors of their
markets.
   American Home Products also manufactures over-the-counter and
prescription drugs. Its other units include Whitehall and Fort
Dodge laboratories.

<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. and its
creditors agreed today to a plan to operate the company and its
subsidiaries during bankruptcy proceedings for the collapsed Wall
Street firm.
   Also, attorneys for the committee of unsecured creditors said
they would oppose an attempt by the Securities and Exchange
Commission to be admitted to the committee. Drexel still owes the
SEC $150 million to settle securities fraud charges brought last
year.
   Under the oversight scheme, which was was approved by U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Howard Buschman III, a panel of three Drexel board
members would oversee the firm's liquidation.
   Four representatives of Drexel's committee of unsecured
creditors would attend daily board meetings, receive information
about the company's operations and have input into the liquidation.
   Drexel's creditors dropped a plan to ask Buschman to appoint an
examiner to run the company during the bankruptcy case, which
Drexel said would have hamstrung operations such as the
time-sensitive sale of securities.
   The compromise agreement follows more than a week of
negotiations in which Drexel forestalled the appointment of an
examiner and the creditors gained access to the firm's liquidation.
It applies to the parent company and subsidiaries, principally the
brokerage Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   The deal also prevents for now the creditors from trying to
force the subsidiaries, which are not subject to the bankruptcy
case, into a Chapter 7 liquidation monitored by the court.
   Drexel still is trying to sell off about $1 billion in junk bond
holdings and other assets. Creditors have said they are concerned
that the company was not receiving fair value for its assets.
   Under the agreement, creditors with access to Drexel's inner
workings will not have veto power over deals made by the firm but
can file protests with the bankruptcy judge.
   The three-member Drexel panel is comprised of chairman John S.R.
Shad, a former SEC chairman; Roderick Hills, a Washington lawyer
and former SEC chairman; and Ralph Saul, a former American Stock
Exchange president.
   Drexel filed for bankruptcy protection Feb. 13 after defaulting
on $100 million in short-term debt and failing to raise new credit.
The firm was hard-hit by a drop in the junk bond market.
   The SEC has the largest claim in the case but was not included
on the 17-member creditors committee. It has filed a request with
the judge to be appointed.
   But Marc Kirschner, a lawyer for the committee, said creditors
would oppose the move. Buschman indicated the SEC should play some
role on the panel but said the final decision rested with the U.S.
Trustee's office.

<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp. will substantially expand
its voluntary severance program to eliminate thousands of employees
and slash expenses as it contends with a slumping U.S. computer
market, officials said Friday.
   Digital officials would not give specific figures on how many
employees might be cut, saying the plan was still being prepared.
But Brad Allen, manager of shareholder relations, said the number
was ``in the ballpark'' of previously estimated figures.
   Industry analysts have said Digital, which employs about 125,900
people worldwide and more than 70,000 in the United States, wants
to pare its staff by at least 5,000 and eventually redeploy as many
as 15,000 employees in new jobs.
   ``The momentum has picked up, the program definitely will be
expanded,'' Allen said, adding the program was to be implemented by
the end of the company's fiscal year on June 30.
   Digital spokeswoman Nikki Richardson said the program will be
similar to a package offered last year to 700 employees at the
company's manufacturing plant in Salem, N.H.
   In that plan, which has been accepted by 260 workers so far,
employees choosing to participate received a cash payment based on
years of service, as well as medical, dental and life insurance
coverage for one year.
   Workers with up to two years of service, for example, received
40 weeks of pay. Those with three to 10 years got 40 weeks, plus
three weeks for each year between three and 10 years.
   ``We are looking at all transition programs on a
business-by-business basis,'' Richardson said. ``What is
implemented will be based on the Salem model.''
   Digital, the world's second-largest computer company behind
International Business Machines Corp., saw its earnings fall 39
percent for the six months ended Dec. 31.
   The company, based in suburban Maynard, blames the drop on a
lackluster computer market in the United States, which has forced
other companies to make cutbacks as well.
   Digital also has reassigned hundreds of employees from
manufacturing to sales.

<TEXT>
   Bank of New England Corp. named Lawrence K. Fish
as its chairman and chief executive Friday as officials continued
restructuring the troubled company in an effort to restore
financial health and public confidence.
   ``While there has been considerable speculation about
candidates, Mr. Fish was our first choice, and the only one to
receive an offer from us,'' Peter L. Scott, head of the executive
search, said in a statement.
   Analysts generally praised the decision to hire Fish, a former
Bank of Boston Corp. executive vice president, but they warned he
might not be able to rescue the bank.
   ``He's coming into a situation that's very grave,'' said Gerard
Cassidy, an analyst with Tucker Anthony Inc. ``If the economy does
not cooperate, a miracle worker is going to have a hard time. A
major part of it is out of his hands.''
   Fish, whose hiring was expected for more than a week, replaces
Walter Connolly, who oversaw the bank's dramatic growth in the
1980s but was ousted this year after the company suffered massive
losses.
   Much of the trouble has been traced to the bank's aggressive
lending practices during a construction boom in the mid-1980s. When
the economy slowed near the end of the decade, the real estate
market tumbled, and the bank was saddled with a mountain of problem
loans.
   Last month, the bank announced it lost $1.11 billion in 1989 and
disclosed it was reviewing financial data from previous quarters to
see whether larger provisions against bad loans should have been
made earlier in the year.
   The bank also is operating under federal consent orders signed
last week, which place the corporation under strict government
oversight while it takes steps to fix its problems.
   Under the orders, the bank must tighten its lending practices,
withhold stock dividends and review the work of its senior level
management to see where changes should be made.
   ``(Fish) has to come down like a ton of bricks on some
situations,'' Cassidy said. ``It's fresh blood. He can come in and
make the decisions.''
   Fish, 45, left Bank of Boston in 1988 to become president and
chief operating officer of Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association in
Beverly Hills, Calif.
   Part of his job at Columbia was to produce a plan to make the
institution less reliant on high risk, high yield junk bonds.
   Fish resigned last August, and since then Columbia has suffered
with a crash in the junk bond market.
   The newly appointed chairman said in a prepared statement Friday
that he believed in the Bank of New England's ``soundness and
strength,'' but acknowledged the road to financial recovery could
be long.
   ``We ... have significant problems. I plan to be thoughtful but
to make decisions promptly,'' said Fish, who was also named
chairman and CEO of the Bank of New England's Massachusetts
subsidiary.

<HEAD>Sultan Of Brunei Denies Role in House of Fraser Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sultan of Brunei on Friday denied any role in
the $1 billion takeover of Harrods owner House of Fraser PLC by the
Al-Fayed brothers in 1985.
   The sultan said in a statement that he had no part in the
takeover, nor did he provide funds to Mohamed, Salah and Ali
Al-Fayed to help them buy it.
   The ruler of Brunei acknowledged that a power of attorney
privilege was granted to Mohamed Al-Fayed to buy the Dorchester
Hotel for the sultan.
   If this privilege was used for something else, it was done so
totally without the sultan's authority or knowledge, the statement
said.
   On Wednesday, the government released a report by Department of
Trade and Industry inspectors saying the Al-Fayeds lied about their
wealth and background to succeed with the bid and that it was
likely they used their association with the sultan to enable them
to obtain funds toward the takeover.
   They said they believed the Al-Fayeds did not have enough money
of their own to buy the retailing group.
   ``The evidence pointing to Brunei is very strong indeed,'' the
report said, ``and we have conveyed our findings to the sultan. Our
views stand.''
   The Al-Fayeds deny they misled anyone and maintain that they
paid for House of Fraser with their own cash.
   Trade Secretary Nicholas Ridley said Tuesday he would not seek
disqualification of any of the company's directors.
   The Serious Fraud Office and the Director of the Public
Prosecutions announced last week they would not pursue a criminal
prosecution in connection with the takeover.

   Sen. Richard Lugar, the ranking Republican on
the Senate Agriculture Committee, introduced a farm bill Friday
that would freeze at current levels the target prices for crops
regulated by the government.
   The measure reflects most of the proposals laid out in February
by the Bush administration for the 1990 farm bill.
   It goes a step further, however, by speaking to target prices,
which the administration avoided.
   Financial analysts have said that even keeping the prices steady
could push the farm bill beyond the administration's proposed
budget, depending on the world commodities market.
   ``We may need to find savings in agricultural programs this
year, but we cannot yet estimate how much,'' said Lugar, R-Ind.
``My purpose today is to introduce a farm bill, and not a budget
reconciliation bill.''
   He said his bill had no price tag, but estimated it could cost
less than the approximately $10 billion currently spent on
agriculture programs if market conditions are right and no weather
disaster occurs.
   Target prices are what the government decides a farmer should
get in the marketplace for wheat, corn, sorghum, barley, oats, rice
and upland and extra-long staple cotton. These commodities often
are called ``program crops'' because farmers that grow them
participate in the federal commodities program.
   If the market price is below the government's target price, the
government pays the farmer the difference, known as a deficiency
payment.
   Congress sets target prices every five years when it passes a
farm bill. Lawmakers say they want to send the 1990 legislation to
the president by the end of the summer.
   Lugar's bill, which also emphasizes flexible planting options
for farmers who grow program crops, is similar to legislation
introduced Wednesday by Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., another
member of the agriculture committee.
   Boschwitz calls his bill the Farm Flexibility Act of 1990. It
also calls for a freeze on target prices.
   Flexibility has been stressed by Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter in promoting the administration's proposals. He says the
government will save money on deficiency payments if farmers are
allowed to let market demand determine their planting decisions.
   His proposals and the Lugar and Boschwitz bills safeguard farm
income by allowing the farmer to collect deficiency payments based
on whatever program crop dominates the acreage, even if the market
losses are on another crop the farmer has decided to experiment
with that year.
   Yeutter says farmers also would be encouraged to rotate crops,
which will be good for the soil and reduce the need for chemicals.
   ``Today, rigid planting rules often lock farmers into planting
the same crop on the same land, year after year,'' said Lugar.
   ``Past farm legislation has encouraged planting of so-called
`program crops' such as corn, even when market demand calls for
more production of non-program crops such as soybeans. As a result,
the United States loses foreign markets.''
   Boschwitz said he came up with his proposal after holding 150
meetings on farms across Minnesota.
   ``Farmers have told me that they would enjoy having the freedom
to adjust their crop mix in response to the market and consumer
demands,'' Boschwitz said.
   He and Lugar said farmers are happy with the 1985 law. Both
senators said their bills would basically extend that law.
   An aide to Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the
agriculture committee, said many committee members will be
introducing farm bills this month.
   They all will be placed together for review of the committee and
debate over which provisions from each should be part of the final
bill voted on by the Senate, the aide said.

   Stock prices closed lower after an unsettled
session on London's Stock Exchange Friday.
   Traders said there was widespread nervousness over a decline in
the pound and the failure of the Bank of England's intervention to
curb the currency's fall.
   The traders blamed the government's continuing political
problems for the weakness in sterling. There were even rumors,
which were swiftly denied, that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
had resigned.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was down 15.7 points, or 0.7 percent, at 2,234.3.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was off 10.6 points at
1,763.8 at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 6.46
points to close at 1,212.72.
   Volume reached 546.8 million shares, compared with 439.4 million
shares Thursday. Dealers attributed the increased volume to a large
program trade.

   The stock market lost ground today in an
unenthusiastic response to stronger-than-expected employment news.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 13.51 to
2,682.66 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 8 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 531 up, 876 down and
486 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported that the civilian unemployment
rate held steady at 5.3 percent in February, while nonfarm payroll
employment swelled by 372,000 on top of an upward-revised increase
in January.
   The pace of job growth substantially exceeded advance estimates,
suggesting that the economy had regained more momentum than many
analysts had thought.
   That was interpreted as a plus for the outlook for corporate
profits, which have been weak lately.
   But brokers said it also raised new worries about upward
pressure on interest rates, and seemed to dim whatever chances
might have existed for any easing of the Federal Reserve's credit
policy.
   NCNB fell 2&lsqb; to 41{. The company said it might see an increase
of as much as 25 percent in its problem loans during the first
quarter of the year.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines dropped | to 106&rsqb;; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph &lsqb; to
41|; Philip Morris 1 to 37&lsqb;, and Texaco &rsqb; to 59&lsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.08 to 186.27. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .84 at 360.67.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 109.05 million shares with two

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. creditors will
receive confidential company information but no veto power over
asset sales under a bankruptcy court agreement reached Friday on
managing liquidation of the collapsed Wall Street firm.
   Also, attorneys for Drexel's unsecured creditors said they would
oppose a move by the Securities and Exchange Commission to join
their committee. Drexel still owes the SEC $150 million from its
1989 settlement of securities fraud charges.
   Opposition to an SEC role on the committee centers on $500
million Drexel already has paid the government that creditors have
said they may seek to recover for repayment of debts.
   But U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Howard Buschman III indicated the SEC,
which has the largest claim against Drexel, necessarily would have
a role in the case even if it was not on the creditors committe.
   ``It is very hard to imagine a ... Chapter 11 case disaffecting
the single largest unsecured creditor, regardless of what hat they
wear,'' Buschman said.
   Under the oversight scheme approved by Buschman, a panel of
three Drexel board members would oversee the firm's liquidation of
about $1 billion in junk bond holdings and other assets.
   A subcommittee of four creditors would attend daily meetings of
the group, receive ``highly confidential commercial information''
about planned transactions by 6 p.m. and attend a meeting the
following morning on sales. The creditors will not have veto power
over deals but can contest sales with the bankruptcy judge.
   Drexel creditors had sought and then dropped a request for an
examiner to run Drexel during the bankruptcy proceedings, which the
firm said would have hampered such operations as the time-sensitive
sale of securities.
   Creditors wanted access to Drexel's inner workings because of
concerns the company is not receiving fair value for its assets.
The creditors also will have access to information about past
transactions, including nearly $200 million in cash bonuses paid in
December and January.
   The compromise applies to the parent company and to its
subsidiaries, including the brokerage unit Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., which are not subject to the bankruptcy case. All asset sales
by the parent company still must be approved by Buschman.
   By granting creditors a role in the firm's operations, the deal
apparently forestalls for now any bid to force the subsidiaries
into a Chapter 7 liquidation, which would be monitored by the court.
   Drexel attorney Alan Miller said the arrangement ensures ``the
process has integrity and every effort is being made to do the best
possible job in the wind-down of these entities.''
   The three-member Drexel panel is company chairman John S.R.
Shad, a former SEC chairman; Roderick Hills, a Washington lawyer
and former SEC chairman; and Ralph Saul, a former American Stock
Exchange president.
   The three, who will be paid $190,000 a year, were named as an
oversight committee to Drexel as part of the firm's settlement of
civil securities fraud charges with the SEC last April.
   The four creditors on the subcommittee are First City Bancorp.
of Texas, Home Capital Services Inc., Equitable Capital Management
Corp. and Copenhagen Handelsbank.
   Drexel filed for bankruptcy protection Feb. 13 after defaulting
on $100 million in short-term debt and failing to obtain new
credit. The firm was hard-hit by a drop in the junk bond market and
its own legal problems.
   The SEC was not included on the 17-member committee representing
Drexel creditors. It has filed a motion to be appointed and has
been negotiating a place on the committee, a move opposed by the
creditors.
   The committee has granted another large creditor, the California
Employees Retirement System, a non-voting place on the committee.
   Lead creditor First City has said it may seek repayment of
Drexel debts from money the firm paid the government last year in
resolving criminal and civil insider trading and other fraud
charges.
   Of the total $650 million in penalties, $300 million was paid in
fines to the Justice Department and $200 million to an escrow
account to satisfy possible investor claims against the firm.
Drexel still owes $150 million to the account.

   Futures prices for soybeans and corn advanced,
but wheat was lower at the close Friday on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   A resurgence of export business and an active soymeal cash
market overseas supported soybean futures, said Joel Karlin, an
analyst with Research Department Inc.
   ``Also South American rains could delay the start of the harvest
there,' said Karlin. ``The soybean advance spilled over into corn
and gave that market a boost.''
   Wheat prices were depressed by rain forecasts for this weekend
over U.S. growing areas, said Walter Spilka, analyst with Smith
Barney Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   At the close, wheat was { cent to 3 cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.83 a bushel; corn was { cent

   Three California metropolitan areas _
Riverside-San Bernardino, Los Angeles-Long Beach and Sacramento _
were among the top five in the nation in single-family home
building activity in 1989, the National Association of Home
Builders reported Friday.
   The Riverside-San Bernardino area, with 38,200 building permits,
topped the list for the second straight year.
   It was followed by the Los Angeles-Long Beach area, with 23,640
permits; Washington, D.C., with 22,360; Atlanta, with 21,750, and
Sacramento, with 16.540.
   The Home Builders said 938,000 single-family building permits
were issued nationally last year, down from 1,005,000 in 1988.
Multifamily permits dropped from 458,000 in 1988 to 403,000 in 1989.
   ``High interest rates at different times during the year coupled
with a sluggish economy, affordability problems and consumer
hesitance caused total permits for single-family and multifamily
housing to drop from 1,463,000 in 1988 to 1,341,000 last year,''
said Home Builders president Martin Perlman.
   ``This is the lowest number of permits issued since 1982, during
the most recent recession, when 1 million units were authorized,''
he said. ``Although at present we expect housing activity in 1990
to closely mirror last year's performance, it could drop
considerably if interest rates continue to climb as they have in
recent weeks.''
   The housing and manufacturing industries were hardest hit as the
Federal Reserve raised interest rates as it sought to stem
inflation last year.
   Fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages rose to an average 11.22 percent
in March before dropping into the single digits in July, according
to weekly surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   Rates surged back over the 10 percent threshhold in mid-August,
dropped back into the single digits in October and remainded there
until January when they topped 10 percent again. They stood at
10.29 percent on Friday.
   ``Another factor that could cause housing activity to drop off
is the availability of funds for acquisition and development of
land and construction of new homes,'' Perlman said, noting the
savings and loan bailout law limits the amount of money thrifts can
loan.
   Despite heading the single-family list, the number of permits
issued in the Riverside-San Bernadino area was 11.2 percent below
that of 1988, the Home Builders said.
   Permits were up 34.2 percent in the Los Angeles-Long Beach area
and down 23.6 percent in the national capital area and 23.7 percent
in Atlanta. Sacramento posted a 16.8 percent increase.
   The Los Angeles-Long Beach area recorded the most multifamily
permits, 24,590. That was down 23.6 percent from 1988.
   Also in the top five of multifamily permits were Seattle with
24,840, a 5.9 percent decrease; Las Vegas with 11,820, down 30.3
percent; Atlanta with 11,740, down 26.6 percent, and Washington,
D.C., with 11,610, a 12.2 percent gain.

   A Swiss company launched a cigarette named for
Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday, figuring that a popular Kremlin
leader might be just the guy to knock the Marlboro man off his
horse.
   The company plans to invade the U.S. market next with the
cigarette, which it calls ``Gorbatchow,'' enticing smokers with its
slogan, ``A Taste of Freedom.''
   The World Health Organization was less than enthusiastic about
the launch of the new brand. The U.N. agency estimates that nearly
3 million people will die this year from tobacco-related illnesses
such as cancer and heart disease.
   Peter Studer, owner of the small company that introduced the
brand in Geneva on Friday, said the name ``Gorbatchow'' was formed
by mixing spellings of the Soviet president's name in various
languages.
   The medium-strength cigarette is a blend of 21 types of tobacco
_ some Soviet, some American.
   Studer said in an interview that cigarette smokers need ``a new
image.''
   ``We think people are bored with a tired cowboy on an almost
dead horse,'' he said, an apparent reference to the advertisements
for Marlboro cigarettes, which are popular in the Soviet Union.
   He said he had not sought permission from Moscow to use the
president's name.
   Studer plans to travel to the United States on Saturday in
preparation for the launch of Gorbatchow International in North
America, and he said he has high hopes for sales.
   Posters announcing the cigarette's debut on the Swiss market
Friday heralded: ``Gorbatchow International Breaks Through The
Wall'' _ joining the ranks of Western companies rushing to
capitalizing on the crumbling of the Berlin Wall.
   ``Just as Gorbachev is changing the world, so the new Gorbatchow
heralds Perestroika on the international cigarette market,'' gushed
the accompanying publicity material.
   The cigarette was first sold in duty-free shops in Hungary and
Bulgaria last May.
   Ironically, Soviet smokers are as yet unable to sample the
cigarette named after their leader. But Studer said he has plans to
introduce it in hard currency shops in Moscow, aimed chiefly at
American tourists.
   Gorbachev has never been seen smoking in public, although he
reportedly once took a puff in Canada. Cigarette use is widespread
in the Soviet Union, which has only a mild anti-smoking campaign.
   The Geneva-based WHO is urging its member countries to ban
promotion of all tobacco.
   ``We are against anything which leads to an overall increase in
consumption of cigarettes,'' said Dr. Clare Chollat-Traquet of the
Tobacco or Health program.

   Shooting ``bio-bullets'' at
diseased big horn sheep wasn't exactly what Fred Paul envisioned
when he began tinkering with a new idea for BB guns.
   As a researcher for 3M Co., Paul was experimenting with a
``safe-shooting'' water-filled BB when he casually splattered a
shot on his office wall.
   ``Suddenly it hit me,'' Paul said. ``What I had wasn't a gun. It
was a long-range delivery device.''
   Fifteen years and more than $8 million later, Paul's privately
owned Ballistivet Inc. is arming ranchers and wildlife
veterinarians with guns that shoot soluble bullets packed with
freeze-dried vaccines.
   If his vision materializes, bio-bullets will dominate syringes
in the $1 billion vaccine sector of the animal health industry. The
company also is targeting the $4 billion market of antibiotics,
wormers, fertility drugs and other pharmaceuticals.
   ``This is a real Buck Rogers deal. It's goofy,'' said Dr. Jerry
Swanson, veterinarian for Hitch Enterprises, a 160,000-head feed
lot business in Oklahoma and Kansas. ``But it's really taking off.
Pretty soon every cowboy in the high plains will have one of these
guns sticking out of his truck window.''
   For now, the company has only 14 employees, controls less than 1
percent of the animal vaccine market, and isn't expected to make a
profit until 1991.
   But Paul, who extracted the technology from 3M in 1983, expects
sales to triple this year to about 3 million bio-bullets. In
addition, the company is moving to a new plant capable of making up
to 100 million doses a year.
   Swanson said the bio-bullet has distinguished itself by adding
speed, comfort, dosage uniformity and sterility to the vaccination
process. The units, fired rapidly from up to 50 feet away,
penetrate flank muscles and dissolve.
   Most important, Swanson said, bio-bullets spare cattle the
stress of syringe inoculations because heavy handling can disrupt a
bovine's eating habits for up to three days.
   Dr. David Jessup, wildlife veterinarian for the California Fish
and Game Department in Rancho Cordova, said the patented invention
has vastly improved the fight against a pneumonia-producing virus
killing large numbers of lambs in a herd of big horn sheep ranging
the Santa Rosa Mountains near Sacramento.
   ``For us this is a godsend,'' Jessup said. ``Any alternative to
having to catch animals is quite useful.''
   Ron Eis, project manager of bio-production development at rival
SmithKline Beecham Animal Health Products in Omaha, Neb., said
bio-bullets are a well-crafted alternative to syringes when used on
wild or unpenned animals.
   ``It's not going to revolutionize the market, and I don't think
you are every going to replace the syringe,'' Eis said. ``But it is
quite quick and quite easy, and there is a niche in the market for
that.''
   In western Wyoming, game wardens are aiming bio-bullets at a
herd of 22,000 elk to vaccinate against brucellosis, a bacterial
disease that kills unborn elk.
   ``It's the biggest wildlife disease program in North America,''
said Tom Thorne of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. ``The
Ballistivet gun is kind of the lynch pin to the whole thing.''
   The system also has been used on wild game in Africa and South
America, but its biggest potential as a money-maker is in the
domestic beef industry, which includes 110 million cattle.
   Paul and Ballistivet President Donald Sturtevant wouldn't
disclose sales projections, but their product now sells for 47
cents to 53 cents apiece, about four times as much as syringe doses.
   Paul said 3M invested $2 million to $3 million to develop
bio-bullets, but decided in 1983 that they didn't fit with its
business. Instead of killing the project, 3M accepted royalties
from Paul, who raised $500,000 in a private stock offering to form
Ballistivet. A year later he kept the company alive by taking out a
second mortgage on his hobby farm.
   ``We laughingly said at the time _ and it was true _ that we bet
the farm on it,'' Paul said.
   Since then, the company has raised $6 million in private stock
sales and has avoided sizable bank debt. It is marketing the
product through distributors who handle other veterinary products.
   Keith Eastman of Northstar Ventures Inc., a Minneapolis-St. Paul
venture capital firm with a 20 percent stake in Ballistivet, said
Paul has operated the company as a ``classic entrepreneur.''
   ``He developed a dream and knows all the reasons that it will be
successful and he refuses to give up on it,'' Eastman said.
   The payoff may not be far away. Sturtevant said major drug
manufacturers have shown interest in purchasing the company, which
would bring a windfall to Ballistivet investors and executives.
   ``Fred's early-on dream is very, very close to being a complete
reality,'' Sturtevant said.

   Stock prices fell today in a cool response to
stronger-than-expected employment news.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 17.34 to
2,678.83 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 520 up, 937 down and
470 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported that the civilian unemployment
rate held steady at 5.3 percent in February, while nonfarm payroll
employment swelled by 372,000 on top of an upward-revised increase
in January.
   The pace of job growth substantially exceeded advance estimates,
suggesting that the economy had regained more momentum than many
analysts had thought.
   That was interpreted as a plus for the outlook for corporate
profits, which have been weak lately.
   But brokers said it also raised new worries about upward
pressure on interest rates, and seemed to dim whatever chances
might have existed for any easing of the Federal Reserve's credit
policy.
   NCNB fell 2\ to 41&rsqb;. The company said it might see an increase
of as much as 25 percent in its problem loans during the first
quarter of the year.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines dropped { to 106{; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph | to
41&lsqb;; Philip Morris } to 37&rsqb;, and Texaco { to 59.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.36 to 185.99. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .96 at 360.55.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 129.86 million shares with an

   American Home Products Corp. has agreed to sell
its Boyle-Midway home products business to Reckitt and Colman PLC
for $1.25 billion, the companies announced Friday.
   The acquisition by Reckitt and Colman, which makes Colman
mustards and other products, is part of its strategy to increase
its household products operations and expand in the United States
and Europe.
   A joint statement from the companies gave no reason why American
Home Products decided to sell Boyle-Midway, whose products include
Woolite laundry soap and Easy-Off oven cleaner.
   However, the division was outside American Home Products' core
pharmaceuticals business, and contributed less than 10 percent of
its $6.75 billion sales in 1989.
   Proceeds of the sale conceivably could be used to reduce the
debt American Home Products took on last year in its $3.2 billion
acquisition of A.H. Robins Co.
   John Considine, a company spokesman, was not in his office when
a reporter called for comment.
   Reckitt and Colman has acquired several other U.S. businesses in
recent years, including the Durkee foods business and Airwick air
fresheners operations.
   ``We think it's a very attractive deal,'' Ian White, an analyst
at the London investment firm Kleinwort Benson Ltd., said of the
Boyle-Midway purchase. ``It would have been hard to think of
anything which would fit better.''
   Reckitt and Colman spent four years trying to persuade American
Home Products to sell the operations, White said.
   Steve Plag, an analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd., said
such a move is necessary for Reckitt and Colman ``if it wants to
make double-digit growth'' in the years ahead.
   The British company's existing products are in mature, slower
growing sectors of their markets.
   Boyle-Midway is about half the size of Reckitt and Colman's
household products and toiletries division. It had pretax profit of
$91 million in 1989 and its $667 million in sales were spread
through the United States, Canada, France, West Germany and Spain.
   Similar Reckitt and Colman businesses had pretax profit of 117
million pounds, or $191 million, on sales of 817 million pounds, or
$1.3 billion, last year. The company did not provide aftertax
profit figures.
   Reckitt and Colman said the purchase was to be funded in part by
selling to existing shareholders 200 million pounds, or $326
million, in bonds which are convertible into stock.
   The balance of the acquisition's cost will be financed through
bank borrowing and the sales of assets valued at about $50 million,
the company said.

   The White House on Friday emphatically denied
a report that President Bush was ``mad as hell'' at Alan Greenspan,
but some private economists said the Federal Reserve chairman was
being given a blunt message to lower interest rates or risk losing
his job.
   The Los Angeles Times in its Friday editions quoted a ``longtime
Bush adviser'' as saying Greenspan's refusal to further lower
interest rates made it extremely unlikely Greenspan would be
reappointed Fed chairman when his term expires in August 1991.
   The unidentified adviser said Bush was ``mad as hell'' over
Greenspan's position and the adviser was also quoted as saying, ``I
can't believe (Bush) will reappoint him and I don't know a soul in
the White House who thinks he will.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater denied Bush was
angry with Greenspan. Michael Boskin, the president's chief
economic adviser, said there was no foundation for the story, which
he termed ``out of left field.''
   However, Boskin stopped short of endorsing the Fed's current
policies and he also refused to say whether he would recommend that
Greenspan be reappointed, calling that question premature.
   Various administration officials have publicly criticized the
Fed over the past several months, but the Times story was the first
to suggest Bush was so upset that Greenspan's reappointment was
unlikely.
   At the Fed, spokeswoman Marci Schneider said Greenspan would
have no comment on the Times story.
   But many private economists said they believed the unnamed Bush
adviser was sending a clear warning that Greenspan needs to relent
his tight-money policies in order to spur economic growth, which
dipped in the last quarter to its most sluggish pace in more than
three years.
   ``The administration thinks that Greenspan is screwing up the
economy. They believe that if only Greenspan would lower interest
rates, we would have faster growth, a lower budget deficit and
everybody would be better off,'' said Michael Evans, head of a
Washington forecasting firm.
   Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, Greenspan's
predecessor, was the target of similar barbed comments in 1983 when
his first term as chairman was expiring.
   ``You never know on these whether they are trial balloons from
some disgruntled element in the administration that wants to get
rid of Greenspan or whether Bush is really mad,'' said David Wyss,
chief financial economist at DRI-McGraw Hill. ``I remember a lot of
similar stories right about the time Reagan reappointed Volcker.''
   But other analysts said Reagan was forced to reappoint Volcker
in 1983 because jittery financial markets had a lot of faith in
Volcker's ability to manage the economy. They said Greenspan may
not command the same amount of respect.
   U.S. financial markets seemed to ignore the entire flap on
Friday, preferring to focus instead on the unemployment report,
which showed the jobless rate holding steady at 5.3 percent as job
growth registered its biggest gain in 20 months.
   Analysts said the job growth supported Greenspan's current view
that the danger point for a recession has passed and the economy
should exhibit a modest rebound in coming months.
   ``Why would you lower interest rates when the economy seems to
be pushing ahead? You would just be running grave risks'' of making
inflation worse, said Robert Dederick, chief economist of Northern
Trust Co. of Chicago.

   Unemployment held at 5.3 percent in February
while the economy produced the most jobs in nearly two years and
factory payrolls swelled for the first time in 11 months, the
government said Friday.
   Private economists and the Bush administration said the report
was fresh evidence that the economy is rebounding from its anemic
0.9 percent growth rate in the final three months of last year, as
measured by the gross national product.
   ``We believe the economy, after a period of slower growth, is
likely to show progress'' in 1990, said Michael Boskin, President
Bush's chief economic adviser.
   He noted that the unemployment rate for black Americans, 10.5
percent, was the lowest since August 1974.
   A Labor Department survey of households showed a seasonally
adjusted civilian jobless rate of 5.3 percent, the ninth
consecutive month at that level. The rate has ranged between 5
percent and 5.5 percent since mid-1988 and is in the lowest range
since the early 1970s.
   A separate survey of employers showed a non-farm job gain of
372,000, the largest since June 1988. The department revised its
figure for January to an increase of 332,000, up from an earlier
estimate of 275,000.
   Manufacturers added 90,000 workers, the first increase since
March 1989.
   However, Labor Statistics Commissioner Janet L. Norwood
cautioned that February gains were inflated by temporary factors.
   All of the increase at factories was attributed to the return of
temporarily laid off auto workers. Other types of manufacturing
were sluggish. Also, construction payrolls grew by 60,000
employees, the result of unusually mild weather in February, she
told Congress' Joint Economic Committee.
   Economist Rudy Oswald of the AFL-CIO warned that the strong
dollar, by increasing the price of U.S. goods on overseas markets,
will dampen prospects for much improvement in manufacturing
payrolls, which are down 199,000 from a year earlier.
   Layoffs by Wall Street brokerage houses and job losses at other
service firms such as AT&amp;T and IBM haven't been reflected yet in
government reports, he said.
   Nevertheless, most private economists, who as recently as two
months ago were expecting a recession this year, said the economy
is beginning 1990 with more vigor than anticipated.
   ``Right now the recession fear has been pretty well put on the
back burner,'' said economist Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust
Co. in Chicago. ``This is an economy which, unless it's hit over
the head, just keeps going.''
   Stock and bond prices both turned down after the report. Brokers
said it seemed to dim whatever chances might have existed for any
decline in interest rates from the Federal Reserve.
   The central bank has been keeping interest rates relatively high
in order to slow the economy and curb inflation pressures. It began
nudging rates down last June after signs of an impending recession
emerged.
   However, it's left monetary policy unchanged since December and
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated in recent
congressional testimony that central bank policymakers have once
again focused policy on dampening inflation.
   ``It's hard for me to see why they would ease in the near
future,'' said economist David Wyss of DRI@McGraw Hill, a
Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm. ``We're going to see the Fed
holding monetary policy stable in the next few weeks.''
   Overall, total civilian employment edged up to 118 million. The
jobless numbered 6.6 million, about the same as January.
   The service sector of the economy added 221,00 jobs, including a
gain of 47,000 for health services, 28,000 in government, 17,000 in
retail trade and 15,000 in finance, real estate and insurance.
   The addition of about 20,000 census workers over the past two
months is bolstering the government number and several hundred
thousand additional workers will be added in the next few months,
Norwood said.
   In other details, the department said average hourly earnings
posted a 0.6 percent rise in February to $9.87, up from $9.52 a
year earlier.
   Also, the average manufacturing work week held steady in
February at 40.7 hours. Overtime fell slightly from 3.7 hours to
3.6 hours.
   The unemployment rates among major demographic groups last month
were:
   _Adult white men, 4.1 percent, up from 4 percent in January.
   _Adult white women, 4.1 percent, up from 4 percent.
   _White teen-agers, 13.0 percent, up from 12.7 percent.
   _All blacks, 10.5 percent, down from 11.3 percent.
   _Adult black men, 9.2 percent, down from 11.2 percent.
   _Adult black women, 9.4 percent, up from 9.2 percent.
   _Black teen-agers, 28 percent, up from 26.7 percent.
   _Hispanics, 7.8 percent, up from 7.1 percent.
   In a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of
the armed services stationed in the United States, the February
jobless rate was 5.2 percent, the same as January.

   The sentencing of GAF Corp. and a top executive
on stock manipulation and other charges scheduled for Friday was
postponed until March 30.
   The sentencing was postponed because U.S. District Judge Mary
Johnson Lowe was ill, lawyers for GAF said.
   GAF and Vice Chairman James T. Sherwin were convicted last
December on eight criminal counts of manipulating the stock price
of Union Carbide Corp. in 1986, in a bid to get more money for
GAF's Carbide stock following a failed takeover of the larger
chemical company.
   The case marked the first conviction of a non-Wall Street
company in the government's white-collar corruption crackdown that
centered on former speculator Ivan Boesky, who paid $100 million
and was sentenced to three years in prison for his role in
insider-trading related activity.
   Two subsidiaries of GAF, a Wayne, N.J.-based manufacturer of
chemicals and building materials, were acquitted. The case went
through two mistrials last year.
   GAF and Sherwin on Thursday resolved related civil charges with
the Securities and Exchange Commission in which the company agreed
to pay $1.25 million in penalties.

   The dollar moved mostly higher Friday in quiet
trading on world currency markets, bolstered by a
better-than-expected U.S. employment report.
   Gold prices slipped worldwide. On the New York Commodity
Exchange, gold settled at $399.80 a troy ounce, off 20 cents from
Thursday. Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of
$399.75 a troy ounce, down 5 cents.
   The dollar got a boost from a U.S. Labor Department report
showing non-farm payrolls gained 372,000 jobs in February, the
largest increase since June 1988. Most estimates had called for a
gain of roughly 250,000 jobs.
   ``The data gave the dollar good background support,'' said Marc
Chandler, an analyst at MMS International in Chicago. ``The numbers
gave greater credence to the soft-landing scenario and reduced
lingering hopes of a near-term easing'' of interest rates, he said.
   The Federal Reserve keeps the economy from overheating by
keeping official interest rates at current levels or by raising
them, as some analysts have suggested the government might be
considering. Higher interest rates enhance the value of
dollar-denominated securities.
   Despite the bullish sentiment surrounding the dollar, Chandler
noted that the fear of central bank intervention prevented the
currency from rising further. Several central banks stepped in to
sell dollars in European trading, but they did not follow through
in domestic markets.
   Because of nagging political and economic problems in Britain,
analysts predicted the pound would continue to weaken against the
dollar.
   The pound lost nearly 2.5 cents amid anxiety over recent
demonstrations against a new tax imposed by city halls across
Britain. In addition, opinion polls show the popularity of the
Conservative government and of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is
at an all-time low as inflation rises and interest rates remain
high.
   Earlier in Tokyo the dollar rose to 151.15 Japanese yen, from
Thursday's 150.83 yen. Later in London, the dollar closed at 151.32
yen. In New York the dollar closed at 151.27 yen, up from 151.09
yen on Thursday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6183 late Friday, cheaper
for buyers than Thursday's late $1.6427. In New York, one pound
cost $1.6170, less expensive than $1.6385 on Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's
late rates included: 1.7025 West German marks, up from 1.7008;
1.5095 Swiss francs, up from 1.5080; 5.7560 French francs, up from
5.7495; 1,257.50 Italian lire, up from 1,255.25, and 1.1804
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1807.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Thursday's late
rates included: 1.7040 West German marks, up from 1.7015; 1.5115
Swiss francs, up from 1.5080; 5.7615 French francs, up from 5.7525;
1.9150 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9164; 1,258.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,255.75, and 1.1792 Canadian dollars, unchanged.
   Gold closed in London at a bid of $399.05 a troy ounce, down
from $401.95 on Thursday. The closing bid in Zurich was $399.50,
down from $400.75. Earlier in Hong Kong gold closed at $400.65 an
ounce, down from $401.95.
   Silver prices also fell. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery finished at $5.095 a troy ounce, down from $5.112
on Thursday. In London the metal traded at a late bid of $5.11 an
ounce, down from $5.15.

<TEXT>
   Aftershocks from President Bush's savings and
loan bailout are rippling across the financial and political
landscapes, touching _ for better or worse _ millions of Americans.
   Taxpayers are hurting, even if they don't know it. Money spent
on savings institutions won't be available for education, the drug
war and other worthy purposes.
   In its first six months, the new bailout agency, the Resolution
Trust Corp., has spent $24 billion, and that's just a down payment.
   Sophisticated savers who put their money in shaky S&amp;Ls paying
high interest rates are hurting, too. An infusion of government
money into S&amp;Ls has pulled those rates down.
   Others are benefiting, however. A booming new scavenger industry
is rising from the ashes of the savings and loans.
   Although the RTC aims at a payroll of 4,800 people by the end of
the year, up from 2,300 now, most of its work will be performed by
private contractors.
   More than 10,000 accountants, lawyers, real estate brokers,
appraisers and property managers have queried the RTC and are
waiting eagerly for the spring, when the agency begins awarding an
estimated $1.5 billion worth of contracts.
   The pickings are particularly juicy for lawyers. The RTC already
is involved in 40,000 lawsuits, inherited from its bureaucratic
predecessors or the S&amp;Ls it's taking over.
   According to RTC Chairman L. William Seidman, that likely will
double, requiring help from 500 outside law firms.
   Commercial banks are beneficiaries of the bill as well. In the
vast majority of government thrift deals to date, banks have been
the buyers, expanding their retail branch networks.
   Also, as S&amp;Ls make fewer loans, banks have moved to replace
them. In the third quarter of last year, residential mortgage
lending at banks surpassed S&amp;L mortgage lending for the first time.
Banks had 38 percent of the market, compared with 35 percent for
thrift associations.
   Both banks and S&amp;Ls, but not savers, are being helped by a
program to reduce deposit rates paid by the institutions under
government control. The RTC has replaced $9.2 billion in high-cost
deposits with government money and expects to spend another $3
billion in March.
   As a result, pressure has eased on healthy S&amp;Ls and banks once
forced to offer high rates to compete against insolvent, but open,
institutions, according to an Office of Thrift Supervision study.
   Meanwhile, developers complain that one provision of the
legislation is having the unintended effect of choking off credit
for worthy projects. The law sharply reduced the maximum loan an
institution can make to a single lender from 100 percent of net
worth to 15 percent.
   It was intended to force thrifts to diversify their risks, but
builders say even good loans aren't being made.
   The culprits of the crisis, both politicians and S&amp;L executives,
also are beginning to suffer.
   The RTC has referred 1,200 cases of suspected fraud to the
Justice Department. In Texas alone, 500 individuals are targeted
for investigation, according to Mark M. Richard, deputy assistant
attorney general.
   Meanwhile, five senators who intervened with regulators on
behalf of millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr.'s Lincoln Savings and
Loan Association are sweating through a Senate Ethics Committee
investigation.
   At least one, Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., the No. 2 Democrat
in the Senate, is fighting for political survival with voters in
his home state.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, is keeping the heat bipartisan. His investigation of the
Lincoln debacle forced top thrift regulator M. Danny Wall, a Reagan
administration appointee, to announce his resignation.
   Now, he plans to focus on the connections between S&amp;Ls and
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s indicted junk bond chief, Michael
Milken.
   Among the S&amp;Ls coming under scrutiny will be Silverado Banking,
Savings and Loan Association of Denver. The president's son, Neil
Bush, served on the failed thrift's board.
   The younger Bush is fighting conflict-of-interest charges
leveled by the thrift office and the House probe will keep that
controversy simmering.

<HEAD>Pan Am Posts $178.3 Million Fourth-Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan Am Corp., which has been seeking a merger
partner to pull it out of financial trouble, on Friday reported a
fourth-quarter net loss of $178.3 million.
   The loss, amounting to $1.21 a share, widened from a net loss of
$51.7 million, or 36 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1988.
   Revenue during the quarter rose to 6.9 percent to $897.9 million
from $839.9 million a year earlier.
   New York-based Pan Am, the nation's eighth-largest airline, said
its revenue was ``severely impacted'' by declining passenger
traffic on its trans-Atlantic routes.
   The airline blamed a 10.3 percent jump in operating expenses
largely on soaring fuel prices. It said its jet fuel costs rose to
$174.7 million in the quarter from $129.4 million a year earlier.
   Pan Am has lost around $2 billion since 1981 and is saddled with
$841 million in debt.
   A year ago, Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett said the airline
needed to merge with another carrier in order to survive. Pan Am
offered about $3.3 billion last May for NWA Inc., parent of
Northwest Airlines, but was outbid by a $3.65 billion offer from a
group led by investor Alfred Checchi.
   Pan Am and the larger Northwest have held discussions in recent
weeks, but a source familiar with the talks said they have stalled.
   A merger between the two airlines ``just doesn't make sense,''
the source said. But he added that some sort of joint marketing
arrangement between the two still could emerge.
   For all of 1989, Pan Am had a net loss of $336.6 million, or
$2.31 a share, compared with a loss of $72.7 million, or 51 cents a
share in 1988.
   The 1989 results include a gain of $110.5 million from the sale
of Pan Am World Services, a contract subsidiary for security and
other services. The 1988 results included an $89.1 million gain
from the sale of delivery positions for Airbus jets.
   Full-year revenue declined to $3.56 billion from $3.57 billion
in 1988.
   ``Despite the severe setback in our 1989 financial performance,
we continued implementing our plans to provide high-quality
customer service,'' Plaskett said in a news release Friday. ``The
positive traffic results in recent months are most encouraging, and
serve to support our belief that consumers are recognizing the
improvements we have made in our service product.''
   Pan Am said its passenger traffic in January was up 23 percent
over the same month last year, followed by a 26 percent jump in
February.
   Some airline analysts believe that, short of merging with
Northwest, Pan Am might sell some of its prized trans-Atlantic
routes or other assets.
   Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon confirmed this week that the
airline has held preliminary talks with Lufthansa German Airlines
on a possible sale of Pan Am's internal German service.
   Last week, Pan Am said it reached agreement with two
unidentified creditors to defer about $106 million in payments. The
first scheduled repayments are due in this year's fourth quarter
and will extend through the fourth quarter of 1991.
   In exchange, the airline agreed to pledge additional assets,
including spare parts, as collateral.

   Stock prices slumped Friday after unexpectedly
strong employment news touched off new interest-rate worries on
Wall Street.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 12.84 to
2,683.33, cutting its gain for the week to 22.97 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by a little less than 3 to
2 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 602 up, 876 down and 484 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 150.41 million
shares, down from 170.90 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 180.54 million shares.
   The Labor Department reported that the civilian unemployment
rate held steady at 5.3 percent in February, while nonfarm payroll
employment swelled by 372,000 on top of an upward-revised increase
in January.
   The pace of job growth substantially exceeded advance estimates,
suggesting that the economy had regained more momentum than many
analysts had thought.
   That was interpreted as a plus for the outlook for corporate
profits, which have been weak lately.
   But brokers said it also raised new worries about upward
pressure on interest rates, and seemed to dim whatever chances
might have existed for any easing of the Federal Reserve's credit
policy.
   In the credit markets, prices of long-term government bonds fell
about $7.50 for each $1,000 in face value, raising their yields to
the 8.62 percent-8.69 percent range.
   NCNB fell 2&lsqb; to 41{. The company said it might see an increase
of as much as 25 percent in its problem loans during the first
quarter of the year.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines dropped { to 106{; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph } to 41;
Philip Morris ~ to 37\, and General Electric &rsqb; to 62|.
   The Gap Inc., which chalked up one of the strongest gains among
retailers announcing February sales results on Thursday, rose 2\ to
61{, trading at new 52-week highs.
   General-merchandise retailing issues finished mixed. Sears
Roebuck was unchanged at 41\; K mart rose &lsqb; to 34, and J.C. Penney
dropped { to 68&rsqb;.
   Hilton Hotels rose ~ to 51{, rebounding from a 10&rsqb;-point slide
Thursday after the company ended its quest for a possible acquirer,
saying it hadn't received any suitable offers.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $16.34 billion, or 0.50
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.17 to 186.18.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 2.67 to 390.35, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 2.34 at 337.93.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
.26 to 436.76. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 361.15, down .36.

<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices extended their losing
streak Friday to four days as demand for refined products remained
sluggish.
   The contract for April delivery of home heating oil fell
sharply, slipping 1.48 cents to 53.86 cents a gallon on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, bringing the contract's losses since
Tuesday to 4.13 cents. Subsequent contract months also declined
Friday.
   The April contract for unleaded regular gasoline dropped 1.15
cents to 54.99 cents a gallon, bringing its losses over the last
four sessions to 4.31 cents. Later months also settled lower.
   Andrew Lebow, an energy market analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man
International Futures Inc., said slowing demand for heating oil and
gasoline brought prices for those products lower, and also took a
toll on crude oil futures.
   The contract for April delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
key grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 35 cents to $20.43 a 42-gallon
barrel after skidding 80 cents the previous three days. Subsequent
contract months also fell Friday.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Tumble</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIO FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures tumbled Friday on speculation that Brazil was
ready to pour more of its crop on the world market.
   On other futures markets, soybeans and corn rose while energy
products, gold and pork prices fell.
   The March futures contract for coffee dipped to nearly 95 cents
a pound on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange.
   Bert Ruiz, a vice president of Balfour Maclaine Corp., said the
big decline in heavy volume followed an estimate Thursday by the
Brazilian coffee agency that it has more than 16 million bags of
coffee on hand.
   ``That's a lot of coffee, but very little of it is the finer,
exportable type,'' said Ruiz.
   It was apparently enough to scare traders, who also felt coffee
futures rose too much earlier this week when it went to over $1.05
a pound, he said.
   Coffee settled 4.25 cents to 7.32 cents lower, with the contract
for delivery in March at 95.18 cents.
   Futures prices for soybeans and corn advanced, but wheat was
mostly lower on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   A resurgence of export business and an active soymeal cash
market overnight in Rotterdam supported soybean futures, said Joel
Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc.
   ``Also, South American rains could delay the start of the
harvest there,' he said. ``The soybean advance spilled over into
corn and gave that market a boost.''
   Wheat prices were depressed by forecasts of rain this weekend
over U.S. growing areas, said Walter Spilka, analyst with Smith
Barney Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 2\ cents lower, with the contract for
delivery in March at $3.83{ a bushel; corn was { cent to 1{ cent
higher, with March at $2.43\ a bushel; oats were \ cent to 2 cents
higher, with March at $1.46 a bushel; and soybeans were 3{ cent to
6 cents higher, with March at $5.87{ a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, pork futures were lower and
cattle prices mostly higher.
   Buying interest in cattle was generated by active feeder cattle
sales at higher prices and expectations for higher feeder prices
next week, analysts said.
   Pork prices were weakened by anticipation that many farmers, who
have spent the past week at home because of bad weather, will be
out marketing their animals on Monday, according to traders.
   Cattle settled unchanged to .35 cent higher, with the contract
for delivery in April at 77.62 cents a pound; feeder cattle were
.05 cent lower to .40 cent higher, with March at 82.10 cents a
pound; live hogs were .15 cent to .30 cent lower, with April at
51.92 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were 1.00 cent to 1.43
cent lower, with March at 50.95 cents a pound.
   Precious metals declined on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
   Gold was pressured by the U.S. dollar firming against foreign
currencies and lower-than-expected February unemployment data,
analysts said. The dollar and unemployment data usually move in
opposite directions from gold.
   Gold settled 20 cents to 50 cents lower, with the contract for
delivery in March at $399.80 a troy ounce; and silver was 1 cent to
2 cent lower, with March at $5.10 a troy ounce.
   Energy products futures sank on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Peter Beutel of Elders Futures Inc. said light refiner buying
interest weighed on futures prices.
   Crude oil settled 23 cents to 35 cents lower, with the contract
for delivery in April at $20.43 a barrel; heating oil was 1.42
cents to 1.70 cents lower, with April at 53.86 cents a gallon; and
unleaded gasoline was .75 cent to 1.74 cents lower, with April at
54.99 cents a gallon.

<TEXT>
   Shareholders and creditors of bankrupt
Public Service Co. of New Hampshire have approved the $2.3 billion
takeover plan proposed by Northeast Utilities, the company said
Friday.
   ``It's a major milestone,'' Public Service spokeswoman Elizabeth
Lavallee said after votes were tallied. ``The approval of
shareholders and creditors wtll be a factor in the bankruptcy
judge's decision on the plan.''
   ahe Fo{{zzzues representing investors and creditors approved the
plan in November and the state Legislature followed, more than a
year after Public Service filed for bankruptcy protection in
January 1988. Northeast won the bidding over three other bidders,
including Public Service itself.
   All classes of secured creditors approved the acquisition of New
Hampshire's largest electric utility by the Berlin, Conn.-based
Northeast.
   All the unsecured creditors, except a group of independent power
producers, approved the takeover, as well as Public Service's
preferred and common stockholders.
   Another group that rejected the plan was the holders of $13.4
million in outstanding warrants to buy Public Service stock, for
which they would get 10 cents a warrant under the plan. The group
is the lowest tier of investors involved, and the last to get paid,
under the reorganization plan.
   ``O_$@o__?8|ooOe vote represents another major step toward
resolving our bankruptcy,'' Public Service Chairman John Duffett
said in a statement.
   Northeast spokesman Jeffrey Kotkin also called the vote a big
step.
   ``If the major creditors and shareholders rejected the plan,
you'd go back to the drawing board,'' he said.
   Public Service mailed 150,000 ballots in January to be returned
by Tuesday. whether to confirm the plan.
   The next immediate step will be hearings in early April in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manchester. Judge James Yacos then must decide
whether to confirm the plan.
   Federal and state regulatory approvals also are required before
the takeover is complete.

blunt message to lower interest rates or risk losing his job.
   The Los Angeles Times in its Friday editions quoted a ``longtime

interest rates made it extremely unlikely Greenspan would be
reappointed Fed chairman when his term expires in August 1991.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission's
attempt to gain jurisdiction over stock-index futures is a ``power
grab'' by an agency that lacks the expertise to effectively
regulate those securities, said Rep. Glenn English.
   Instead, problems in the futures markets can best be solved by
strengthening the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said
English, an Oklahoma Democrat who chairs the subcommittee that
oversees the CFTC.
   Speaking Friday at the Futures Industry Association's annual

   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, preparing
to lead a high-level trade delegation to Tokyo, said he believes
America now has a real chance to reduce its huge trade imbalance
with Japan.
   Mosbacher said Friday he was carrying a ``caseload of cases,''
which would give the Japanese a chance to demonstrate the new
spirit of cooperation evident in last week's summit meeting between
President Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.

   Exxon Corp. shareholders and environmentalists
said that their attempts to prod the giant oil company into a more
environmentally sensitive direction could include a call at Exxon's
annual meeting to oust its chairman.
   Six shareholder proposals on environmental issues have been
cleared by the Securities and Exchange Commission for inclusion in
Exxon's proxy statement and will be voted on at the company's April
25 annual meeting, the groups said Friday. The company opposes all
the proposals.

   Bond prices fell sharply Friday, knocked down by
news of strong employment growth in February.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond tumbled } point, or
$7.50 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which rises when
the price falls, surged to 8.62 percent from 8.55 percent late
Thursday.
   Analysts attributed the market's weakness to a Labor Department
report showing non-farm payrolls expanded in February by the
largest amount in 20 months.
   After the report was released in the morning, ``It was put your
helmet on and get in the foxhole,'' said John Sebastian, executive
vice president of Clayton Brown &amp; Associates in Chicago.
   The seasonally adjusted gain of 372,000 jobs was the largest
since June 1988. In another sign of strength in the labor market,
the department revised the non-farm payroll gain for January to
332,000, up from an earlier estimate of 275,000. The overall
unemployment rate held steady at 5.3 percent.
   ``These numbers show an economy that's considerably stronger
than some would have thought,'' said William Brachfeld, an
executive vice president at Daiwa Securities Inc. in New York.
   That interpretation reinforced the widely held perception that
the Federal Reserve has insufficient cause to pursue a more
generous credit policy and push interest rates lower.
   In fact, Brachfeld said, some traders now have begun to ask
whether the Fed might be more inclined sometime in the near future
to tighten its grip on credit in a stepped-up effort to squeeze
inflation out of the economy.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues declined \ point to &rsqb; point, intermediate
maturities lost 7-16 point to 17-32 point, and long-term issues
fell 23-32 point to 13-16 point, according to figures provided by
Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, was down 4.41 at 1,147.97.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds closed at 91 19-32, down 3-16 point. The
average yield to maturity edged up to 7.45 percent from 7.44
percent late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.23 percent as the
discount jumped 7 basis points to 7.97 percent. Yields on six-month
bills soared to 8.30 percent as the discount advanced 7 basis
points to 7.87 percent. Yields on one-year bills increased to 8.43
percent as the discount rose 8 basis points to 7.83 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8 5-16 percent, unchanged
from late Thursday.

<HEAD>Boeing Cuts Number of Layoff Notices by Nearly Two-Thirds</HEAD>

   The Boeing Co. issued layoff notices to about 600
workers Friday, roughly a third as many as anticipated nearly two
months ago, but a company spokesman said employment forecasts for
the year remain unchanged.
   About three-fourths of the two-week notices were for workers at
the 767 and 747 plant in verett, with the remainder scattered
around the rest of the Puget Sound area, Paul Binder said Friday.
   In January, Boeing said it expected to cut its Seattle-area work
force by 5,000 people in 1990, but hoped that half those lost jobs
could be absorbed through retirements or resignations. The company
said it anticipated laying off 1,700 hourly workers by April, and
another 800 later in the year.
   Binder said the overall forecast for the reduced work force,
with about half the reductions accomplished through layoffs,
remained unchanged.
   He said he did not know the reason for the apparent delay in
layoffs but added that 200 to 300 more employees would get pink
slips in about two weeks and another 200 or so about a week and a
half after that.
   Under federal law, Boeing was required to give 60-day notice to
all workers who could be affected by the layoffs. Binder said the
two-week notices are a more definite indication that workers will
lose their jobs, ``but even if they do get the notice ... they
still might not be laid off.''
   About 1,400 of those facing layoffs are in Everett. Boeing has
been trying to reassign as many of the workers as it can to other
plants and has set up centers to help them find new employment.
   Binder said that in the time since the initial notices were
issued, more people may have retired or taken other jobs,
especially those who knew their jobs were threatened.
   In Wichita, Kan., Boeing's second-largest employment center, 91
workers have been laid off since January and as many as 100 more
may get pink slips by the end of the month, said Pete Dakan of
Boeing Military Airplane Group.
   Boeing employment in Wichita has been reduced from about 24,000
people to about 23,500 so far this year, Dakan said.
   He added that more layoffs in Wichita, which are separate from
those announced by Binder, may be announced early next week.
   Boeing employed about 106,700 people in the Seattle area at the
end of 1989, and employment has since shrunk by about 800, Binder
said. Worldwide, Boeing employs about 163,000.
   The layoff notices come at a time when Boeing has a record firm
backlog of more than 1,700 commercial jets, with the Everett plant
alone booked through 1996.
   Boeing hired about 10,000 additional employees last year and was
so strapped for production workers that at one point it borrowed
600 employees from the Lockheed plant in Marietta, Ga. Mandatory
overtime was a major issue in the 48-day Machinists union strike
against Boeing last fall.
   Last year Boeing fell behind schedule in introducing and
certifying the new 747-400 jumbo jet, which was brought out in four
different versions. Now, with startup and certification work done,
company officials say the extra 747 workers no longer are needed.
   Boeing said earlier it had hoped to absorb those workers in
defense contracts such as work on the B-2 stealth bomber, for which
it is a major subcontractor to Northrop, but warming East-West
relations and the fall of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe have
cast doubt on the future of many military projects.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission, the
bastion of law and order on Wall Street, is forming an advisory
committee to help Soviet bloc countries keep their infant stock
markets orderly and honest.
   But securities and Soviet economic experts in this country are
divided over whether it's too soon for emerging Eastern European
economies to launch The Hunt for Red Investor.
   ``They want to run before they can walk,'' said Ed A. Hewett, a
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
   He and other experts on Eastern European economic affairs said
developing a banking system might be a better course of action.
   But they agreed it was important for the U.S. government to take
the initiative in guiding the way to capitalism despite market
drops and junk bond scandals.
   ``Whatever our problems are, theirs are greater,'' said Marshall
I. Goldman, associate director of Harvard's Russian Research
Center, adding ``... I think the last thing they want is a series
of Drexel Burnham Lamberts popping up.''
   Last Tuesday, SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden, who has met
recently with high-level financial officials from the Soviet Union,
Hungary and Poland, announced that the SEC is forming an Advisory
Committee on Emerging Securities Markets in Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union.
   ``Obviously they need a banking system,'' Breeden said in a
telephone interview late Friday. ``But I disagree that you should
do nothing but focus on banks and ignore the development of a
capital market.''
   He said bank loans alone could create ``a greater dependency on
debt financing than might be desired, if we can also create equity
markets.''
   Breeden said the Soviet delegation sought his advice during a
visit that included a tour of the New York Stock Exchange and major
securities firms.
   ``They said equity was something they would like to move
toward,'' he said. ``They obviously are not going to go from zero
to the New York Stock Exchange in the next six months, but they are
looking for systems with low volume that can be expanded.''
   But a source familiar with developments leading up to the
formation of the SEC comittee said the idea grew out of the Malta
summit meeting between President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   Administration officials saw the creation of stock markets in
the formerly Communist-dominated countries as ``symbolic of
democracy,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Despite the frenzy over newly won political freedoms, however,
experts contacted this week said Eastern Europe may not be quite
ready to shift from Das Kapital to venture capital.
   ``The first step is not going for a sophisticated stock
market,'' said Stuart Brown, an assistant professor of economics at
Georgetown University.
   Most experts thought it was a great idea for the SEC to be
involved at such an early stage, but questioned how ready Moscow
and Warsaw were for leveraged buyouts and real estate investment
trusts.
   ``Their questions are not about junk bonds, but `What is a
stock? What is a bond? How do we move money around?''' said Hewett.
   ``The securities markets are really only a small part of the
economic system,'' said Alan Bromberg, a securities law professor
at Southern Methodist University. ``My guess is they must first
have a banking system that will provide seed money for private
enterprise.''
   If the Federal Reserve Board has any plans for Eastern Europe,
the nation's top economic policy-making body is keeping them close
to the vest.
   The central bank said in a statement Friday: ``In the course of
our ongoing relationship with officials of foreign economies, it is
not uncommon for them to visit fellow officials of the Federal
Reserve. And in recent months these visits have included officials
from some East European countries.''
   The advisory committee, which may meet as soon as next month,
will recommend what action the SEC and the financial industry can
take to help create organize securities markets in Eastern Europe,
said Breeden.
   ``I hope they have somebody in there who knows something about
the Soviet Union,'' said Goldman. ``There can be a real danger to
thinking it operates like a normal economy.''
   Because of official corruption, oppressive laws and a huge black
market, the Soviet Union is ``a crime-ridden society'' that needs
advice on regulations, he said.
   Breeden said there was no more fitting manner for this country
to help economic development in Eastern Europe ``than by assisting
in the creation of free capital markets in these countries.''
   But some critics have noted that a system that has seen a stock
market crash, a steep drop in the junk bond market and the collapse
of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the securities firm that pioneered
the high-yield, high-risk bonds, may not be the best example to
emulate.
   ``I think just the opposite,'' countered Arthur Mathews, a
prominent Washington securities attorney. ``Don't you think the
fact that our markets could survive a crash and the collapse of
Drexel without a depression shows their strength.''

   MGM-UA Communications Co. said Friday
it had received a $50 million deposit from Pathe Communications,
which has agreed to acquire MGM-UA for $1.27 billion.
   Last year, Qintex Group's $1.5 billion offer for MGM-UA
collapsed after it missed a down payment of the same size. Qintex
had outbid Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. for the company.
   MGM-UA officials said this week that they were more confident
that Pathe, controlled by Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti,
would be able to finance a buyout.
   Pathe agreed Wednesday to buy MGM-UA, and said it would make
three more monthly deposits of $50 million each into an escrow
account, bringing the total to $200 million.
   It is to commence a tender offer of $20 per share for up to 100
percent of MGM-UA's common and preferred stock by March 14, an
offer that would amount to the $1.27 billion if all shares are
tendered.
   Pathe also inherits $400 million in MGM-UA junk bond debt as
part of the deal.
   Further cementing the deal are guarantees that MGM-UA will get
at least $75 million from distributing upcoming Pathe movies.

   A home video company headed by founder of
Disney's home video operations has agreed to acquire the struggling
National Lampoon in a deal valued at $4.5 million, the companies
annnounced Friday.
   The video production and distribution outfit, J2 Communications
of Los Angeles, said it expected to complete the acquisition in
late May. National Lampoon will become a division of J2 under the
Lampoon's co-presidents, Daniel Grodnick and Tim Matheson.
   The pair acquired a controlling stake in the satirical magazine
last year and have been trying to rebuild its circulation and
advertising, which have faltered in recent years.
   James P. Jimirro, the chief executive of J2 and the former head
of the Disney Channel and Disney Home Video, said, ``The name
National Lampoon has been synonymous with satire for the past 20
years.''
   ``We look forward to integrating National Lampoon into the J2
operations and providing capital and additional support which will
help the magazine and related activities during the coming years,''
Jimirro said.
   J2 Communications produces such fare as the comedy video ``Dorf
on Golf,'' starring Tim Conway, and ``Chef Paul Prudhomme's
Louisiana Kitchen.''

<TEXT>
   Two drugs used to treat heart attacks save lives
equally well despite a 10-fold difference in their cost, according
to research announced Thursday.
   The risk of dying before leaving the hospital was the same no
matter whether the patient was treated with streptokinase or tissue
plasminogen activator, called TPA.
   When each drug was combined with a second drug called heparin,
streptokinase showed a lower death rate.
   But an official of Genentech Inc., the major biotechnology
company that makes TPA, the more expensive drug, said he believes
the study was not the final answer for American doctors.
   The results, released at a medical conference in Florence,
Italy, dealt with more than 20,000 European heart attack patients.
The researchers were from Italy and elsewhere in Europe.
   The study found an overall death rate of 8.9 percent after
treatment with TPA and an 8.5 percent rate after treatment with
streptokinase. Statistically, those rates are the same.
   Both drugs are designed to destroy blood clots that have caused
heart attacks by blocking a crucial blood vessel.
   Genentech's TPA holds about two-thirds of the market while
streptokinase has about a third. Genentech reported TPA sales of
$197 million in 1989.
   But their costs vary greatly. An editorial in the New England
Journal of Medicine last year said one treatment with streptokinase
costs $78 at a San Francisco hospital, while TPA costs $2,268. A
separate report has cited a 10-fold difference.
   The New England Journal editorial accompanied a study that
suggested the two drugs worked equally well, but it looked at the
health of the heart's main pumping chamber rather than death rates.
   The newly announced study ``bears out what a number of
cardiologists have been really ... saying for the last four or five
years, that there has been absolutely no scientific evidence that
TPA was superior to streptokinase,'' said an American investigator
familiar with the results, William O'Neill of William Beaumont
Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich.
   But David Stump, director of clinical research for Genentech,
said the trial's treatment procedure hampered the effectiveness of
TPA.
   Patients did not receive early intravenous doses of heparin
along with TPA therapy, he said. Many American doctors take that
step to keep opened arteries from becoming obstructed again, he
said.
   The heparin given some patients in the study was administered
much later in the course of therapy and through injections under
the skin rather than intravenously, he said in a telephone
interview from Florence.
   The combination of TPA plus heparin in the new study gave a
death rate of 9.2 percent, and streptokinase plus heparin yielded a
7.9 percent rate.
   G. Kirk Raab, president and chief executive officer of
Genentech, called for further tests of patients who got early
intravenous injections of heparin.
   The study won't affect a planned merger between Genentech and
Roche Holding Ltd., the Swiss pharmaceutical giant that was
announced last month, according to a Roche news release.
   ``Individual trials limited to certain aspects only would not
influence such important investment decisions,'' Roche said.
   The study also found the risk of stroke was greater in patients
treated with TPA. The stroke rate was 1.3 percent among the group
treated with TPA compared with 1 percent in those treated with
streptokinase.
   ``These stroke rates are within the 1 percent to 1.5 percent
range seen in other studies with thrombolytics (anti-blood cloting
drugs) and are within the range seen in heart attack patients not
receiving thrombolytic therapy,'' Genentech said in a statement.
