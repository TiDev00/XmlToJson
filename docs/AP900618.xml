   Amnesty International on Monday charged
Brazilian police routinely torture and kill criminal suspects with
the complacency of government authorities.
   According to the London-based human rights organization, a
growing number of victims of ``torture and ill-treatment are
children aged 18 and under.''
   The charges were in a 17-page report titled ``Torture and
Extrajudicial Execution in Urban Brazil'' that was released during
a news conference at the Sao Paulo branch of the Brazilian Bar
Association.
   Political prisoners were routinely tortured during the military
regimes that ruled this country from 1964-85. Abuses diminished but
did not end with the return of civilian rule, according to Amnesty.
   Torture continues to be ``endemic in Brazil and can happen at
any time and anywhere _ in police stations and vehicles, in prisons
and in secret,'' the report said.
   While this country of 150 million residents has no more
political prisoners, criminal suspects are still subject to torture
and ill-treatment, Amnesty said.
   ``There is evidence that the police have responded to increasing
social violence by taking the law into their own hands, torturing
and killing ordinary criminal suspects and prisoners. Torture is an
everyday occurrence in Brazil and extrajudicial execution is
common,'' the report said.
   Rights violations are not official policy, it said, ``but to
tolerate these abuses is to condone them. The alarming incidence of
unlawful killing, torture and cruel and inhuman treatement of
citizens in official custody indicates the authorities are not
taking effective steps to eradicate these practices.''
   At the news conference, Bacre Waly Ndiaye, vice-chairman of the
organization's International Executive Committee, said policemen,
``knowing their crimes will go unpunished, because of the
prevailing climate of impunity, form death squads whose victims are
those least able to defend themselves _ the poor and children.''
   Death squads kill at least one child a day, Ndiaye said.
   The report said the lack of public confidence in the ability of
police to deal with the growing crime rate stimulates the growth of
death squads and vigilante groups known as ``justiceiros,''
Portuguese for justice-makers.
   Justiceiros active in the industrial suburbs of Sao Paulo are
paid by local businessmen to eliminate suspected petty criminals,
the report said.
   The respected Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper reported in June that
justiceiros had killed about 40 people in 45 days.
   Ndiaye said officials admit torture is one of the main
techniques used to solve crimes and that confessions obtained
through torture were often used as evidence.
   ``It is time for the Brazilian government to take action against
the growing number of human rights violations and respect the
country's constitution. By doing nothing, it is not only condoning
but encouraging these abuses,'' Ndiaye said.
   Brazil's 1988 constitution states that ``no one shall be
subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment.'' It
stipulates that ``the crime of torture is not subject to bail,
amnesty, pardon or statute of limitations.''
   Amnesty's report also denounced the ``systematic torture'' of
inmates in many of Brazil's overcrowded prisons.
   In April, 1989, nearly 91,000 prisoners were jammed into prisons
built to hold less than 44,000, it said.
   The report was the result of four years of research and was
based on a series of fact-finding visits and meetings with
authorities, local rights organizations, lawyers, torture victims
and their relatives.

<HEAD>2 Live Crew `Nasty' in Greenville, Not in Sacramento</HEAD>

   A local prosecutor Monday declared
obscene the sexually explict ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' album by
rap group 2 Live Crew, and banned its sale in Pickens and
Greenville counties.
   The album also has been declared obscene by a federal judge in
Florida, and San Antonio, Texas, store owners pulled it from
shelves last week after they were threatened with arrest. In
Sacramento, Calif., the district attorney Monday refused to
prosecute merchants selling the album.
   Stores will be sent letters about the ruling and must clear the
album off their shelves by June 26 or risk arrest, said prosecutor
Joseph J. Watson.
   ``The whole purpose of the lyrics is to appeal to the prurient
interest of sex. They are patently offensive, and they are utterly
without any serious artistic or literary value,'' said Watson,
summing up the state law's three-part test of obscenity. ``It's
filth.''
   Sale of the album is now banned in communities that comprise
one-fifth of the state's residents. On Thursday, the album was
declared obscene and its sale prohibited in Richland County.
   Anyone found guilty of selling obscene material to a minor faces
a maximum of five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. The penalty
for selling to an adult is up to three years in prison and a $3,000
fine.
   To get a conviction, a prosecutor would have to convince a jury
the album is obscene.
   Debbie Bennett, spokeswoman for 2 Live Crew's label, Luke
Records, wondered whether Watson would now look at other material
being sold.
   ``I hope this means they're also taking out all the X-rated
movies and all the other albums on major labels that have all the
same language as 2 Live Crew,'' Ms. Bennett said in a telephone
interview from Miami.
   ``I hope they're not limiting it to a relatively obscure black
group and an even more obscure black label.''
   She said more than 1.7 million copies of the album have been
sold.
   Sacramento District Attorney Steve White Monday rejected
requests to prosecute merchants who sell the album, saying it was
``extraordinarily crude and offensive'' but did not violate state
obscenity law.
   ``To be legally obscene, a work must appeal to prurient
interest, describe sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and,
taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political or
scientific value as judged against a contemporary statewide
standard,'' White said in a statement.
   Meanwhile in Tennessee, Acuff-Rose Music Inc. sued 2 Live Crew
in federal court, saying the group wasn't authorized to record a
song derived from the Roy Orbison hit ``Oh, Pretty Woman.''
   Acuff-Rose seeks unspecified damages and forfeiture of all
copies of the group's ``As Clean As They Wanna Be'' album, the less
explicit version of the one at the center of the obscenity
controversy, because it contains a rap version of the Orbison hit.

   A threatened scientific boycott over U.S.
travel restrictions on foreigners infected with the AIDS virus has
failed, but the policy will remain a major issue at this week's
international AIDS meeting.
   The French and Swiss governments, the European Parliament and
other groups had urged scientists to boycott because of U.S.
immigration policy.
   But officials say registration for the Sixth International
Conference on AIDS, which opens Wednesday, will come close to the
original estimate of 12,000.
   Among those registered are Luc Montagnier and other members of
France's Pasteur Institute, one of the world's leading AIDS
research centers.
   Only 50 research papers were withdrawn from the 2,500 studies
originally submitted, conference spokesman Dana Van Gorder said.
   ``No one wants to see the law interfere with the work of this
conference,'' Van Gorder said. ``People are coming here to improve
the work they are doing in response to AIDS. They felt this is the
highest responsibility.''
   So do some two dozen AIDS activist groups, which announced plans
to attend the five-day meeting to protest the immigration policy
and publicize their claims of government inaction and drug company
profits on AIDS medications.
   ``Not joining the boycott was a painful decision for us,'' said
Tom Cunningham, a member of the New York chapter of the AIDS
Coalition To Unleash Power, better known as ACT UP. ``But we do
need the opportunity to challenge AIDS researchers and the
pharmaceutical companies.''
   The controversy is over a 1987 Senate amendment ordering the
Public Health Service to place infection by HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS, on the list of contagious diseases that may bar
foreigners from entering the United States.
   The list also includes leprosy, tuberculosis and five sexually
transmitted diseases.
   The restriction has been condemned by scores of AIDS groups,
including the National Commission on AIDS, as an infringement on
human rights. The commission's chairman, Dr. June Osborn, said the
policy fosters the impression that AIDS and HIV infection can be
easily transmitted.
   A number of groups involved in AIDS education programs and care
of AIDS patients are boycotting the conference.
   The list includes almost 100 non-governmental organizations,
including the International Planned Parenthood Foundation and the
League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, a Geneva-based
federation of Red Cross organizations from 149 countries.
   The World Health Organization also criticized the immigration
policy and, for a time, contemplated backing out as co-sponsor of
the conference.
   Dr. Bruce Dick, health department director at the League of Red
Cross and Red Crescent, said many of the boycotting groups could
lend valuable ``ground-level experience'' to scientists at the
conference.
   ``The most negative thing about us not participating is the
missed opportunity to use a big conference like this to form
partnerships,'' he said.
   Dick said the society had 40 people from 30 countries at last
year's conference in Montreal and originally had planned to send
more representatives to San Francisco.
   The Bush administration twice has tried to blunt the outcry.
Last year, the Immigration and Naturalization Service adopted a
waiver policy that would allow those infected with HIV to stay in
the United States up to 30 days for business purposes, conferences,
medical treatment and family visits.
   The waiver also offered foreign visitors greater
confidentiality, eliminating permanent identifying marks on their
passports.
   In April, the INS said it would issue new 10-day visas for those
coming to this country for professional or scientific conferences.
Those applying for the visas are not required to state if they are
infected with HIV.
   The new visa plan cooled some of the protest, but many remain
opposed to any singling out of AIDS- or HIV-infected people.
   ``The administration has made some efforts, but we still find
the policy objectionable,'' said Sue Lucas, co-ordinator of the
United Kingdom AIDS Consortium for the Third World, a group of 40
British organizations with AIDS programs in developing countries.
   ``We are particularly concerned that this type of discrimination
in the United States would have an impact on discrimination in
other countries,'' she said.
   The controversy has brought calls for the administration to
remove AIDS and HIV infection from the list.
   Legislative leaders point to a Government Accounting Office
opinion that the secretary of health and human services can remove
the restriction, but administration officials maintain a directive
from Congress cannot be eliminated that way.
   Rep. J. Roy Rowland, D-Ga., introduced legislation in April that
would give the Department of Health and Human Services authority
over deciding which diseases are on the list.
   ``It is my opinion the administration would like a way out of
this,'' said Rowland. ``The present rule reflects adversely on the
United States, which has been a leader in scientific and medical
research for many years.''
   The United States always has placed health and social limits on
those entering the country. In the late 18th century, a prohibition
existed on ``prostitutes and beggars.''
   Today, 33 separate categories limit travel to this country, such
as medical conditions, mental disease, political ideology, bigamy
and homosexuality.
   During the wave of immigration through New York's Ellis Island,
people were forced to run up and down stairs to see if they winded
easily _ a sign of tuberculosis, INS spokesman Duke Austin said.
   The present law, which dates back to 1952, first barred those
with tuberculosis and leprosy. By 1987, the list included five
sexually transmitted diseases: gonorrhea, infectious syphilis,
chancroid, granuloma inguinale and lymphogranuloma venereum.
   AIDS was added to the list by the Public Health Service in June
of that year; HIV infection was placed on the list by congressional
mandate in August.
   Thirty-three other countries place entrance restrictions on
foreigners with AIDS or HIV infection, usually on those seeking
extended stays. Iraq demands AIDS tests for anyone staying more
than five days. Those seeking permanent residence or a stay longer
than 12 months in Australia also must be tested. Bahrain tests
certain foreign workers, such as hotel staff and hairdressers.
   Those seeking permanent entry to the United States must have a
full physical examination, but visitors are not tested for disease.
   ``Basically, it is an honor system,'' said Austin. ``There is no
way to tell unless an inspector ascertains through the discovery of
drugs or certain physical characteristics that the inspection
should be pressed further.''
   Opponents of U.S. policy say the issue is one of setting a
standard for the rest of the world. They hope a final resolution
can be reached before 1992, when another international AIDS
conference is scheduled for Boston.
   ``To many countries, the United States is a leader in terms of
its policies,'' said Dick, of the League of Red Cross and Red
Crescent. ``It is essential that we have non-discriminatory
policies because it is through non-discrimination that we are going
to control this disease.''

   Dean Rusk and Nikita Khrushchev, two leaders
of the Cold War, now have something else in common: sons who are
offering assessments of their fathers' roles in both war and peace.
   Richard Rusk, in what he calls ``my attempt to know my aging
father,'' interviewed the former secretary of state for long hours
with a tape recorder rolling.
   Sergei Khrushchev, describing himself at one point as ``a
witness to my father's meditations,'' chronicled the last seven
years in the life of the Soviet leader who was driven from power in
1964.
   ``As I Saw It,'' by Dean Rusk as told to Richard Rusk, will be
published June 25 by W.W. Norton &amp; Company.
   ``Khrushchev on Khrushchev: An Inside Account of the Man and His
Era,'' by Sergei Khrushchev is scheduled for June 28 publication by
Little, Brown and Company.
   Nikita Khrushchev was a coal miner's son who rose through the
ranks of the Soviet bureaucracy, holding power for 11 years as
Communist Party chief and six years as premier before being
deposed. He died in 1971.
   Rusk, 81, lives in Athens, Ga. He was secretary of state from
1961 to 1969 and was, as his son says, ``an architect of a war that
killed 58,000 Americans and nearly a million Vietnamese.''
   He was with President Kennedy at the summit in Vienna in June
1961, when, in his words, Khrushchev ``set out to intimidate this
new, young president of the United States.''
   Sergei Khrushchev's view is different: ``The main thing I recall
happening at Vienna was that the two men got acquainted. Father
returned to Moscow after the summit with a very high opinion of
Kennedy.''
   Rusk encountered Khrushchev again after going to Moscow in July
1963, to initial a limited atomic test ban treaty. At the Soviet
premier's villa on the Black Sea, they batted a badminton bird back
and forth with no net and no lines on the floor.
   After his downfall, Khrushchev was all but forgotten in the
Soviet Union _ pictured, his son recalls, as ``a dimwitted hooligan
cast upon the throne by fate.'' Only recently has the
rehabilitation of his image begun.
   Rusk, although he held office longer than any secretary of state
since Cordell Hull and retired to an honored professorial chair in
his native Georgia, had his detractors, too.
   Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, a Kennedy White House aide,
found him ``the perfect number-two man'' _ ``a baffling leader''
who had ``authority but not command.'' As Richard Rusk sees it,
Schlesinger was suggesting ``that Rusk wasn't smart enough for the
job.''
   Staying on in the Johnson administration after Kennedy's death,
the State Department veteran became increasingly a target for
opponents of the Vietnamese war.
   The young Richard Rusk, a student at Cornell, found himself
``caught between love for my father and the growing horror of
Vietnam,'' unwilling to volunteer and unwilling to embarrass his
father by joining the antiwar movement.
   In a tape-recorded session two decades later, he pressed Rusk on
the point and found him ``unprepared ... for admitting that
thousands of American lives, and hundreds of thousands of
Vietnamese, might have been lost in vain.''
   For the elder Rusk, there were no doubts: ``Because of this
nation's commitments, I had a duty to perform: to try to prevent
North Vietnam from overrunning South Vietnam by force. That was my
job. And I tried to do it.''
   The taciturn Rusk and the voluble Khrushchev both at first
resisted the idea of writing their memoirs.
   ``All we wanted to do was to get him involved in some kind of
project,'' writes Sergei Khrushchev. ``Father didn't respond to our
first suggestions. Sometimes he laughed them off.''
   When he did agree to tape record his memoirs, Soviet authorities
of the time resisted publication, but the material was published
widely abroad. As Sergei Khrushchev's own book neared publication,
he was seeking to have a Russian edition of his father's memoirs
published ``so as to restore his good name.''
   Rusk vowed when he took office in 1961 that he would never write
his memoirs, saying he would leave it to the historians.
   In a preface to Richard Rusk's book, however, he tells how his
son ``came home to Georgia after many years in Alaska, years spent,
I now realize, attempting to understand and make peace with the
events of his youth and of my public service.''
   ``He could not do this, could not reforge the broken chain,
without me,'' Dean Rusk writes.
   Reforging the chain, Richard Rusk interviewed family, critics
and friends as well as his father.
   ``At every stage of Dean Rusk's life _ youth, public servant,
retired statesman _ were signs of mortality,'' he writes. ``But
mainly I found affirmation of the goodness in my dad.''

   Attacks by Sunni Moslem zealots on banks,
breweries and night clubs underline the growing influence of
Islamic fundamentalists in one of the most secular Arab states.
   In May, an Islamic court convicted journalist Ibrahim Abu Naab,
59, of apostasy, or abandoning Islam, and ruled that he be divorced
from his wife and separated from his children.
   Abdullah Shamayleh, prosecutor-general of the Islamic Court,
urged it during Abu Naab's trial to permit ``the shedding of his
blood.''
   That would not appear necessary, since anyone who kills an
apostate is immune from prosecution under Islamic law.
   Jordan's civil law does not grant immunity, however, and the
civil appeals court probably will overrule the Islamic tribunal's
verdict.
   The ``crime'' Abu Naab committed was attending a meeting in
Britain of the breakaway Qadiani sect, which is outlawed in many
Moslem states, and allegedly converting from the mainstream Sunni
sect.
   His case reflects the increasing strength of fundamentalists,
who became the largest legislative bloc after the November
parliamentary elections, Jordan's first in 22 years. The Moslem
Brotherhood won 22 of the 80 seats and Islamic independents got 12.
   They have pledged to work for strict application of Sharia, the
Islamic religious law, but have said they will work within the
constitution and not challenge King Hussein.
   Arab leaders worry about increasing fundamentalism among the
world's 1 billion Moslems. Recent moves toward greater democracy in
some Arab states are largely an outgrowth of that concern.
   Khalil Abdulrahman Khalifa, a 28-year-old engineer, said: ``The
Islamic tide is growing these days because the people have lost
trust in their governments, which have not moved so far to solve
the central Arab issue, the Palestinian problem.
   ``We want liberation and we want to have an effective role in
the world. We want the Arabs to be respected, not ignored. The
Islamic parties attract us because they match our outlook.''
   Jordan's fundamentalists are not having it all their own way. A
government ban on male hairdressers working in women's beauty
salons, imposed in May because of Islamic pressure, was canceled in
two weeks after strong public protest.
   The fundamentalists sought to enforce a Koranic law that a woman
cannot be touched by a man who is not her husband or a relative.
   Even though the fundamentalists ultimately lost, many Jordanians
are disturbed about the government of Prime Minister Mudar Badran
bowing to the pressure in the first place.
   When the prohibition was imposed, the English-language Jordan
Times declared: ``It is clear that such a ban will lead to other
decisions that will limit the freedom of the individual.''
   It said the sole purpose was ``to cater to the whims of some
religious or conservative groups which do not represent the
majority of the population.''
   During street protests in May, after an Israeli civilian killed
Palestinian workers in Israel, fundamentalists attacked businesses
considered un-Islamic.
   Mobs raided banks, the Dutch-owned Amstel brewery and night
clubs that serve liquor, causing damage worth millions of dollars.
Charging interest and drinking alcohol are forbidden by the Koran,
the Moslem holy book.
   Several Amman night clubs were attacked in February and March.
   State television has been affected. Scenes of actors kissing, or
even holding hands, are deleted because the fundamentalists
consider them lewd.
   Newspaper or poster advertisements showing scantily clad women
have disappeared.
   Attendance at prayers on Friday, the Moslem sabbath, has grown
considerably.
   The area covered by prayer rugs on the sidewalks around Amman's
Husseini Mosque in the teeming bazaar district has been extended to
accomodate more people.
   Fundamentalist strength is on the rise in the Israeli-occupied
territories across the Jordan River, challenging the Palestine
Liberation Organization. A movement called Hamas, or Zeal, has
played a major role in the 30-month-old Palestinian uprising and
made major gains in municipal elections in Israel's Arab towns.
   In Egypt, Moslem militants have attacked Christian churches and,
in clashes with police this year, 34 people have been killed and
more than 70 wounded. Fundamentalism is spreading in Tunisia.
   In Turkey, Moslem but secular, fundamentalist violence is
increasing and several outspoken champions of secularism have been
assassinated.
   Earlier this year, the Turkish government was forced to lift a
rule against women university students wearing Islamic-style
headscarves on campus.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Ion Iliescu's decision
to use miners to impose mob rule in Bucharest last week raises a
crucial question: Is he the democrat he says he is, or a dictator
in the making?
   The 60-year-old former Communist, due to be inaugurated this
week, dented his image at home and abroad with his tough tactics
and raised doubts about his political abilities.
   Iliescu seems increasingly to take a hard line covered with only
a veneer of liberalism.
   The signals of his government are contradictory, as illustrated
by Monday's action in the two chambers of parliament, dominated by
Iliescu's National Salvation Front.
   The Chamber of Deputies voted overwhelmingly to give ``the
forces of law and order'' authority to clear anti-Communist
demonstrators from a central square.
   At virtually the same time, the Senate voted to appoint an
all-party commission to investigate last week's violence, which
began Wednesday when police brutally ended a 53-day protest at the
same square.
   Iliescu condemned instigators of anti-government violence that
broke out after the crackdown. Opponents in government denounced
the violence too, but they are determined that any inquiry will
also focus on violence by miners summoned by Iliescu to quiet the
protesters.
   The miners were given food and transport and were somehow able,
as out-of-towners, to hunt down opposition leaders in remote parts
of Bucharest.
   It will be a test of Iliescu's commitment to democracy whether
the many questions raised by last week's events are answered
clearly.
   Since taking power after the revolution that swept Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu from power in December, Iliescu's Front
has done little to dismantle the Communist institutions it
inherited, to clarify its goals or explain its political mistakes.
   It seems scarcely logical, for instance, that Iliescu should
alienate the West by summoning the miners when he desperately needs
Western aid to rebuild Romania.
   Yet Iliescu not only summoned but thanked the miners. Drawing on
stock phrases learned in decades of Communist Party service, he
alienated the West further by suggesting the right-wing revolt had
outside support.
   The unanswered questions about Iliescu's policies since December
are ample fodder for various theories.
   Does the use of the miners rather than soldiers or police to
restore order mean Iliescu does not command army or police loyalty?
Was he facing an organized revolt? Or was unrest provoked by the
Front in order to crack down on opposition?
   Diplomats and knowledgeable Romanians believe that at least some
of the army, which traditionally has played an important role in
politics, is not with Iliescu.
   ``The army is in love with its image,'' said a Western diplomat,
arguing the military wanted no part in breaking up the
anti-government demonstration or dealing with the aftermath.
   Defense Minister Victor Stanculescu was at a Warsaw Pact meeting
Thursday when an influential group pressing for more democracy in
the army was ordered dissolved. A purge may follow.
   On Friday, Iliescu said he was moving control of the police to
the Defense Ministry and thinking about establishing a national
guard.
   If the guard proved an efficient, impartial anti-riot squad, it
could help police, who clearly have little idea how to control
crowds without shooting.
   But Dinu Patriciu, a leader of the opposition Liberal Party, and
Stefan Doinas, a leading intellectual, said the guard could become
a tool for oppression.
   Iliescu says miners have already volunteered to join.
   Romanians speak of growing signs of surveillance similar to the
Securitate, the now-disbanded secret police force under Ceausescu.
   Doinas suspects ex-Securitate men and others who lost out in the
revolution are stirring unrest ``to prove that there will be no
quiet in our country as long as they are not returned to their
positions.''
   Iliescu, according to this view, is either unable or unwilling
to control the ex-Ceausescu forces.
   For the opposition, another test of Iliescu's commitment to
democracy will be the reappearance of the liberal daily Romania
Libera and three other publications the miners shut down.
   Iliescu came to power with virtually universal support from
Romanians relieved to be rid of Ceausescu.
   To most Romanians, Iliescu has remained the guardian of the
revolution, and thus he won last month's elections by a landslide.
   But last week's arrests and attacks on intellectuals increased
fears about Romania's fate under him.
   ``A people which does not respect and protect its intellectuals,
a people ready to condemn its writers, artists and thinkers, risks
living without chance of survival,'' said Ministry of Culture
spokesman Maria Borza.
   ``For decades, the Communist regime took the intellectuals for
dangerous opposition. Let's not make the same mistake.''

   The new right-wing government is refocusing
Israeli policy to emphasize talks with Arab states rather than a
dialogue limited to Palestinians.
   Officials complain, however, that Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
is getting little support for his peace efforts from Israel's major
ally, the United States. Shamir's government is especially peeved
about last week's show of impatience by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III.
   Speaking to a House committee, Baker urged Israel to resume
stalled talks and recited the White House telephone number, adding
sacrastically: ``When you're serious about this, call us.''
   Shamir responded to Baker with his own measure of sarcasm and
impatience Monday, calling on the United States to stop dithering
and abandon its dialogue with the PLO because of the attempted
terrorist attack May 30 on Israel.
   Speaking to students in a Tel Aviv suburb, Shamir mocked the
U.S. efforts to wrest a denunciation of the attempted raid from PLO
chief Yasser Arafat, saying they ``want to ask Arafat to continue
to lie to them.'' Arafat has denied involvement in the attempted
raid but has not condemned it.
   ``I'm suprised by the patience shown by our friends and allies,
the Americans, in discussions with those murderers,'' Shamir said.
   The United States has promoted dialogue with the Palestinians as
a starting point for the Middle East peace effort. Israeli
officials believe circumstances have changed.
   Yossi Olmert, director of the Government Press Office, said the
war of words in the Middle East was heating up to the point where
it was necessary to emphasize an overall solution, not one limited
to the Palestinian problem.
   ``We have to adjust to what is happening. The volume of threats
are such that you have to pay attention,'' he said.
   Yossi Ben-Aharon, Shamir's top policy adviser, conceded that
shifting gears would likely bring accusations Shamir is stalling
and looking for ways to avoid talking to the Palestinians.
   ``It's a risk we have to take. No matter what we do we are
immediately accused of buying time and shying away from process.
It's worth it to us to absorb such criticism provided we feel we
are on the right track,'' he said.
   Israeli officials maintain that an Israeli initiative of May
1989 called for ending the state of war with Arab states and for
Palestinian elections. But they said it was reshaped by Baker to
focus exclusively on the Palestinians.
   Ben-Aharon said Israel had problems with Baker's plan, which
proposed Palestinian-Israeli dialogue in Cairo.
   First, he said Israel could not accept a behind-the-scenes role
for the PLO that would inevitably grow into a ``concrete
participation.'' He said the Cairo talks should be limited to
technical discussions of elections and not major political issues
such as the future of the occupied West Bank.
   ``Another problem we had was there was a neglect of the Arab
states' participation and posture in peace process, and we have
entreated the United States to get the Arabs into the process,''
Ben-Aharon said. He told The Associated Press that diplomatic
contacts had begun to arrange ``an in-depth review'' of Middle East
policy with the United States.
   Ben-Aharon said Israel's new government had sent a number of
signals that it was ready to deal with the Arabs, but most had been
ignored.
   He said Israel had agreed to a U.N. envoy's visit to look at
conditions of Palestinians in occupied areas and had begun
reopening Palestinian universities closed at the onset of the
Palestinian uprising 30 months ago.
   Also, Shamir gave an interview to the Egyptian weekly Mayo in
which he called on Syrian President Hafez Assad to come to Israel
and talk peace without conditions. Foreign Ministry officials
promptly hinted the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria
in 1967, would be on the table.
   ``This appeal was not made as part of a special initiative. We
are appealing to all Arab leaders with a proposal to come to
negotiations with us about peaceful relations between us and
them,'' Shamir said at the Tel Aviv suburb of Petah Tikva.
   Ben-Aharon said that as part of Arab-Israeli peacemaking, Arab
states could state a willingness to lift an economic boycott
against Israel, acknowledge Israel's existence, and rescind the
U.N. resolution that equates Zionism with racism.

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Freed American slaves who founded this
West African nation brought with them the gracious antebellum
architecture and plantation mentality of their former masters.
   In the land they declared a republic in 1847 and named for
liberty, they adopted tailcoats and top hats despite the sweltering
heat. They also enriched themselves by stealing the land and labor
of native Liberians and sometimes selling them into slavery.
   The vengeance bred by the early years of brutal repression is
resurfacing in Monrovia.
   Many of the Southern-style mansions _ with their balconies,
verandas, gables and wooden shutters _ are boarded up. Their owners
have been trying to flee the country since June 9, when soldiers
killed three Americo-Liberians, the name given to the descendants
of the country's elitist founders.
   Liberia has been torn for 5{ months by an insurgency, and the
Americo-Liberians _ about 5 percent of the nation's 2.5 million
people _ fear further reprisals because they are accused of
supporting the rebel's leader, Charles Taylor.
   Taylor, half Americo and half native Liberian, is trying to oust
President Samuel Doe. More than 1,000 people, mostly civilians,
have been killed in the struggle.
   On Saturday, both sides called for a cease-fire, pending further
negotiations. The statement was issued after five days of talks in
neighboring Sierra Leone.
   Despite the call for a truce, fear among the Americo-Liberians
remains.
   Some of the tightknit group of just 300 families deny their
people even exist now because there has been so much intermarriage
with what they used to call ``aborigines.''
   In the old days the ``boss man'' Americo-Liberian would steal
his workers' wives to enrich the gene pool.
   Later, they adopted native wards for the same purpose.
   Most Americo-Liberians have opposed Doe since he seized power in
a bloody 1980 coup that ended their 133-year monopoly on power and
money.
   The adventurous men and women who came to the West African coast
said they wanted to give the continent their Western knowledge. The
flow of American blacks to Liberia continued into this century,
although the majority had arrived before the American Civil War
ended in 1865.
   Their showcase ``democracy'' initially was feted by successive
American and other Western governments. The praise ended in 1931,
when a League of Nations report said young boys were being hunted
like animals and sold into slavery. Others were forced to work for
no pay and tortured if they did not, the report said.
   Today, the ``country people,'' or native peasants of Liberia,
still live in hovels in Monrovia and in huts in the undeveloped
countryside with no running water or electricity. The poverty is
similar to that endured by the sharecroppers who eked out a living
in America's South.
   Doe, a master sergeant when he took power, moved from a
broken-down barracks with a leaking roof into the $6 million marble
executive mansion that Israelis built for President William
Tolbert, whom the coup plotters slaughtered and disemboweled.
   But Doe perpetuated the corruption of the leaders he overthrew,
keeping the power and state money among his own Krahn people, who
make up about 5 percent of the population.
   However, Americo-Liberians continue to dominate the economy
because of the wealth they had accumulated before 1980.
   ``Americo-Liberians still for the most part make up the educated
class of Liberia and the present exodus will hurt this country's
economy no end in the long run,'' said Clifford Flemister, a banker
whose father brought him to this country at the age of 11.
   ``If I had not come to Liberia, I'd probably be a gangster in
Chicago or a fat master sergeant in the army,'' Flemister, 49, said
in an interview, adding he made his first million more than a
decade ago.
   Like many Americo-Liberians, he has strong ties with the United
States, although he said he feels more at home in Sweden, where he
went to college.
   Flemister was born in Chattanooga, Tenn., and owns a house in
Columbus, Ohio, where his Liberian wife has lived since the 1980
coup and where his two children go to school.
   Liberia's ties to the United States are omnipresent.
   The ``Lone Star'' flag with red and blue stripes is a copy of
the Stars and Stripes.
   Policemen wear hand-me-down uniforms from the United States,
some still with New York Police Department labels.
   Supermarkets sell Planter's corn chips and Philadelphia Cream
Cheese.
   ``Hey man, what's up?'' is the American-style greeting on the
streets, thickened by the Liberian accents of natives whose tonal
dialects make the expression difficult to understand.
   ``It's a matter of class, culture and education that raises us
above the superstition and cannibalism of some of the country
folk,'' said an Americo-Liberian woman. She spoke on condition of
anonymity because ``such views are widely held but political
dynamite right now.''

<TEXT>
   A shadowy group of young military
officers, using anti-American rhetoric, claims to lead an
underground movement to overthrow President Corazon Aquino and the
social system she represents.
   The Young Officers Union, or YOU, appeared last year as yet
another clique in the factionalized Armed Forces of the Philippines.
   The extent of YOU's membership within the 15,000-member officer
corps _ or even whether the organization exists at all beyond press
releases _ is the subject of considerable speculation among
government officials, the press and foreign diplomats.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos dismisses YOU as a public
relations creation of the better-known Reform the Armed Forces
Movement, whose image has been tarnished because of links to
discredited politicians.
   But some officials apparently take the group seriously; the
military has offered a total of $77,000 in rewards for the arrest
of seven renegade officers identified as YOU leaders.
   Some military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
estimate that up to half the lieutenants and captains in field
units are either members or supporters of YOU.
   Those estimates, if true, raise the specter of continued
political instability in the Philippines even after Mrs. Aquino
leaves office in 1992.
   YOU's origins are as obscure as the organization itself. Sources
said it emerged as a separate faction after renegade Lt. Col.
Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan failed in an attempt to overthrow Mrs.
Aquino in August 1987.
   Some officers claim YOU also played a major role in last
December's bloody coup attempt, along with Honasan's Reform the
Armed Forces Movement.
   Sources said the younger officers broke with Honasan because
they felt he and other Movement leaders were indecisive and too
closely allied to opposition politicians.
   Military sources both inside and outside YOU said the new
organization was also born of frustration among junior officers
with fighting the 21-year war against Communist rebels.
   A colonel, speaking on condition of anonymity, said combat
experience has persuaded many young officers that the real enemy is
not the Communist New People's Army, but poverty, social
oppression, corruption and the government's failure to deliver
basic services.
   ``These idealist guys who are out in the field see the
difficulties in fighting the Communist insurgents with very little
help from the government and corruption in their military
leaders,'' said a general, who also insisted on anonymity.
   The colonel said charter members of YOU included intelligence
officers who became sympathetic with some goals of the Communists
because of their exposure to rebel propaganda and deplorable
conditions in the countryside.
   Like the Communists, YOU uses nationalistic, anti-American
rhetoric. It calls for sweeping social, economic and political
change and an end to ``American interference'' in this former U.S.
colony.
   YOU leaders include Capt. Washington Javier, Capt. Rafael
Cardeno and Lt. Diosdado Valeroso _ all former members of the
Philippine Constabulary's special anti-Communist intelligence
command. All are now underground.
   According to sources, YOU also has adopted the organizational
structure of the outlawed Communist Party of the Philippines.
   One YOU member, who uses the alias 1st Lt. Ruben Sanggalang,
said the leadership is divided into nine cells of about six members
each.
   Each cell is led by a political officer who conducts
``teach-ins'' and is responsible for a specific task, such as
propaganda or communications, he said.
   As in the Communist underground, members of one cell usually
know only one member of any other cell. This enables cells to
maintain contact without fear that a single arrest could compromise
an entire group, he said.
   Sources say YOU sponsors Marxist-style political discussions
among combat units and is trying to establish ``support groups''
among civilians to broaden its base.
   YOU statements are replete with the same references to
``American imperialism'' and the Aquino ``puppet regime'' as those
of the Communists.
   ``A considerable number of young military officers have come to
realize that their supreme loyalty is to uphold the dignity,
freedom and social justice that the Filipino people rightfully
deserve,'' YOU said in a recent statement.
   ``We vow Cory will not finish her term as an illegitimate
president,'' the statement added. ``For as long as the majority of
our beloved countrymen have to suffer the indignity of living in a
prostituted sovereignty and sham democracy, we vow to continue the
struggle that we hope and pray will finally free our beloved
countrymen from the clutches of the imperialist U.S. government.''
   Much of the anti-Americanism appears linked to U.S. intervention
in the December coup attempt, when U.S. F-4 Phantom jets flew air
cover for government forces.
   ``We are warning them (Americans) that the next time they
meddle, they will find themselves trapped in another Vietnam,''
Sanggalang said.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland is awash in would-be benefactors.
Executives, ambassadors, governors, heads of state, celebrities _
the parade of visitors trailing their good intentions through the
country's wrecked economy is endless.
   The goodwill visits have become tiring, but Poland must must try
to cash in on the bonanza before the angels from the West turn to
another fashionable cause.
   For every planeload of visitors, ranking government members must
clear schedules and prepare briefings. They fear closing off any
opportunity.
   But now, although very politely, some Poles are beginning to
wonder: Will much of anything come of all the meetings, briefings
and conferences?
   ``The Poles are suffering from visitor fatigue,'' said Jerzy
Gabrielczyk, a London businessman working as a top adviser to the
Industry Ministry through the British Know-How aid fund.
   ``They come and have meetings with the ministers. They think it
is fantastic _ to have a meeting with a minister. Then they shake
hands and nothing ever happens,'' he said.
   Some missions have been fruitful: A German builder has started a
new airport terminal and a French firm provided computer services
for the May municipal elections. The well-publicized homecoming of
heiress Barbara Piesecka Johnson brought a monumental art exhibit,
but talks on investing in the Gdansk shipyard broke off.
   The visits can mark the beginning of genuine cooperation, said
Jerzy Baczynski, writing in the weekly Polityka.
   ``Yet on many occasions ... their only outcome are suggestions
on further aid to Poland'' _ subject to further study, he said.
   The foreign delegations are political, parliamentary,
industrial, international _ and countless.
   A small sampling from recent weeks: Portuguese business leaders,
Japanese investors, the U.S. Import-Export bank, India's health
minister, Iran's vice minister of building, Britain's foreign
minister, Sweden's minister for cooperation with developing
countries, East Germany's defense minister, former U.S. National
Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, French police officers and
the governor of Maryland _ along with his state's topsail schooner,
the Pride of Baltimore II.
   They come to teach: how to speak English, run a democratic
election, organize a free press. And to learn: How bad are the
telephones? How much would it cost to retool a factory?
   The new Polish government hopes they have also come to give:
harvesters for farmers, computers for banks and money to help the
nation's young market economy grow.
   But some, it seems, mainly come for what photographers call a
``grip and grin'' with Poland's leadership.
   A Western diplomat regularly required to arrange visits senses a
new ambivalence among Polish officials.
   ``It is ambivalence because intellectually even some very
impatient people realize they are getting pretty generous aid
packages from most of the West and it is in their interests to be a
good trooper,'' the diplomat said.
   ``Still, we have noticed a growing impatience with this constant
flow of visitors,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Paul Schurick, Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer's press
secretary, said he felt it.
   ``That notion was in the air ... that they've seen a lot of
foreign delegations here,'' he said.
   But the governor is convinced a personal visit is worthwhile if
it comes with an all-business message, said Schurick: ``We've got
no intention to solve Poland's problems but if there can be two or
three specific contracts with Maryland, then I'm going to do what I
can to make them happen. ... A personal visit could put it over the
top.''
   Polish officials are reluctant to talk about the downside of
being so sought-after.
   One with a well-known name, whose portfolio includes pressing
economic issues, was overheard by a diplomat asking with a tinge of
annoynce when faced with a new visitor, ``What am I, the minister
of tourism?''
   Polish leaders have developed A lists and B lists of meeters and
greeters according to a visitor's rank, the Western diplomat said.
   ``Everyone wants to see (Solidarity parliament leader Bronislaw)
Geremek, everyone wants to see (Lech) Walesa. But just because
everyone wants to come to Poland, it doesn't mean that they can see
them,'' said another Western diplomat.
   Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz, the architect of Poland's
economic reform plan, is one of those in ``huge demand,'' said an
aide.
   ``First of all there are the politicians who come here out of
curiosity,'' he said. ``And of course all the ambassadors are
pushing their way in through doors and windows. We decided
Thursdays would be the day for them, so we see a maximum of two
every Thursday.''
   Then there are business executives, the aide said. ``There is
great danger that one could be granted a meeting and another
wouldn't be, so we are really trying to limit them. ... Of course,
we have to make exceptions for really big figures, such as the head
of the (West German) Dresdner Bank.''
   At the Labor Ministry, Director General Leslaw Nawacki said many
visits ``have the nature of reconnaissance. People just come to see
what we are doing or what kind of help they could offer.''
   ``The main cost of these visits is hard work and time,'' he
said. ``People who come often can't really understand the situation
in Poland, going from socialism to a market economy. Nobody has
done it before and everybody who comes here looks at it from the
point of view of the West.
   ``On the other hand, we must admit with shame that we are not
prepared either. It's something completely new to most of us.''

<TEXT>
   The U.S.-Japan security pact reaches its 30th
anniversary this month. It's like an old pair of shoes.
   It pinched a bit when new, but now it's well-worn and
comfortable.
   The pact's anniversary comes as the Soviet bloc disbands and
Western allies in NATO seek fundamental changes in their alliance.
   U.S. and Japanese officials suggest no correspondingly
fundamental look at their defense alliance, although voices in both
countries have called for change, some saying the treaty is no
longer needed.
   ``That is a short-sighted analysis,'' said Koichiro Matsuura,
director-general of the North American Bureau in the Foreign
Ministry. ``We do need it for the foreseeable future. There are
still sources of instability in the Far East.''
   Yet some regional problems show signs of easing. Chinese-Soviet
relations have warmed. A beginning of rapprochement between South
Korea and the Soviet Union could ease tension on the divided Korean
peninsula. An end to Cambodia's 11-year-old civil war may be in
sight.
   The United States is reducing its troop strength in the Far
East, now 135,000, by 14,000 or 15,000 over three years without
cutting combat capability.
   While the United States will enjoy a drop in defense spending,
it calls on prosperous Japan and South Korea to assume greater
responsibility for their own defense.
   Washington wants Tokyo to boost the $3 billion it spends
annually to support the 50,000 U.S. troops based in Japan. The
government says it will do all it can, but sharp questions are
being asked in Japan.
   The liberal-leaning Asahi Shimbun's Aera magazine recently ran a
long article questioning whether Japan has had a ``free ride'' on
defense, as some assert in the U.S. Congress. Asahi Shimbun said
Japan provides scarce land rent-free for U.S. bases and goes beyond
the treaty's requirements in paying billions to support U.S. troops.
   The article said Japanese military commanders reacted angrily to
a Washington Post story quoting Maj. Gen. Henry Stackpole of the
U.S. Marine Corps as saying U.S. forces in Japan were a ``cork in
the bottle'' to prevent Japan from rearming.
   Such a comment means U.S. troops are not partners in defense but
merely occupying Japan, as they did after the war, the Japanese
officers were quoted as saying anonymously.
   The Pentagon quickly said Stackpole's remarks were not U.S.
government policy.
   ``We were very happy to hear that,'' Matsuura said.
   But both Washington and Tokyo come close to saying the same
thing, arguing that the treaty does not hold Japan down, but rather
permits Japan to have security under the U.S. umbrella without a
military buildup that could make its neighbors nervous.
   Matsuura acknowledged that other Asian countries ``see that
because Japan has the security treaty with the United States, Japan
can remain to be a small or medium power.''
   The 1960 treaty replaced the unequal 1952 treaty that was
negotiated while the United States was fighting the Korean War. The
1952 treaty granted the United States the right to base troops in
Japan but did not obligate it to defend the country.
   The treaty also admonished Japan not to develop an offensive
military capability _ repeating a major aim of the U.S. occupation
of defeated Japan, that the country not be permitted again to
threaten its neighbors.
   The revised treaty did not include that ``cork in the bottle''
and it obliged the United States to defend Japan, which has a
no-war clause in its postwar constitution.
   In 1960, the streets of Tokyo were convulsed by anti-treaty
demonstrations. President Dwight D. Eisenhower's plan to visit
Japan was called off amid fear for his safety. Those signing
petitions against the treaty were said to number 13 million; 6
million held protest work stoppages.
   Their argument was not so much anti-American, but more a fear
that the treaty could drag Japan into war.
   The conservative government rammed a bill ratifying the treaty
through Parliament on June 23 that year with the opposition absent
on a protest walkout.
   The United States-Japan Security Treaty of 1960 does not need to
be renewed. Either party may give notice to the other of its
intention to end the agreement and it would expire one year later.
   The treaty's anniversary will be marked with receptions in Tokyo
and Washington, and President Bush and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu
have scheduled a telephone conversation to praise the durable
relationship.
   Yet underneath the self-congratulations lie challenges to the
word and spirit of the treaty:
   _Friction over trade problems and technology could weaken the
web of the alliance. Leaders in both countries cite this danger as
a major reason for making sure the economic frictions are resolved.
   _The diminished Soviet threat undercuts the rationale for the
treaty. Tokyo and Washington say the pact is a geopolitical anchor
on which Japan can negotiate with the Soviets over disputed islands
in the Kuril chain off northern Japan.
   _Japan's Socialists, who oppose the treaty, are enjoying a
political revival. They say that if they took over the government,
they would not abruptly change the treaty, but their long-term aim
is to make Japan a neutral, unarmed nation.
   Socialist lawmaker Tadatoshi Akiba said the treaty ``will not be
necessary sometime in the future. ... Maybe it will disappear
without anyone noticing.''
   Relations with the United States have gone far beyond security
matters, he said, citing recent trade negotiations that seek to
change each country's society to reduce trade frictions.

<TEXT>
   Soviet and U.S.
teen-agers plan to blaze a new trail in international relations
next month when they work together to restore Yellowstone's
fire-scarred landscape.
   The visit by 12 youths from Latvia and Estonia was three years
in the making and began with a trip to Moscow by a National Park
Service delegation.
   ``The politics of getting these crews over here are
incredible,'' said Helen Wellborn, a regional official for the
33-year-old Student Conservation Association, which is coordinating
the exchange.
   Last fall it was decided the first exchange should involve
Yellowstone, which is recovering from 1988 fires that blackened
almost half the 2.2-million-acre park.
   The U.S. and Soviet teen-agers will help repair trails in the
park, doing such things as clearing debris and countering erosion.
   Immediately afterward, the crew of 12 American youths will
travel to the Soviet Union to work on trails in Lahemaa and Gauja
national parks with the Latvian and Estonian teams.
   While the main emphasis is to learn more about each country's
parks, the exchange is ``a gesture of international good will as
much as anything else,'' said Destry Jarvis, the association's
executive vice president in Washington.
   The exchange has involved long, detailed planning. Tensions
between Moscow and the Baltic states, particularly Lithuania, have
caused some worries.
   ``If there was any sense or sign of military activities (against
Latvia or Estonia), we would certainly cancel,'' Jarvis said.
   The Soviets will arrive in Bozeman on July 5 and leave July 28.
During their stay they will also visit nearby Grand Teton National
Park and travel to Cody for a rodeo, Jarvis said.

   Dame Eva Turner, a soprano with extraordinary
range and power and a memorable star of Puccini's ``Turandot,''
died Saturday at age 98.
   Miss Turner, who had suffered a broken hip three months ago,
died at Devonshire Hospital in London, said Katherine Morgan, a
relative.
   Born in Oldham, Lancashire, Miss Turner joined the Royal Carl
Rosa Opera Company in London in 1916. She made her debut a year
later as a page in Wagner's ``Tannhaeuser'' and rapidly took on
lead roles in productions of ``Tosca,'' ``Aida'' and ``Madama
Butterfly.''
   Miss Turner made her debut at La Scala in Milan in 1924 as Freia
in Wagner's ``Das Rheingold.''
   From 1950 to 1959 she was a professor of voice at the University
of Oklahoma. She returned to London and taught voice at the Royal
Academy of Music until 1966.
   She was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire
in 1962, and was awarded honorary doctorates of music by Manchester
and Oxford universities.
   Miss Turner left no immediate survivors.
   Funeral arrangements were to be announced Monday.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If snappy quotes sold for a buck apiece,
Norman J. Ornstein would be a wealthy man.
   A political scientist at the American Enterprise Institute, a
right-of-center think tank, Ornstein is hardly a household name.
But he happens to be one of the most widely quoted people in
Washington.
   At the ring of a telephone, he spouts expert opinions on just
about any topic, from perestroika to peanut subsidies, from ethics
to ethnic restaurants.
   He's the ``King of Quotes,'' the sultan of sound bites, the imam
of instant analysis, the titan of talking heads. He's the darling
of TV producers and the garrulous savior of quote-hungry newspaper
reporters battling a deadline.
   ``If I have an opinion, I'll give it,'' he says.
   Jo-Ann Moriarty remembers her introduction to Ornstein in 1986,
when she was a rookie Washington reporter for States News Service
and needed some quotes for an election-year story she was writing
about Rep. James Broyhill, R-N.C.
   ``The guy at the next desk said, `Have you called Norm Ornstein
yet?' I said, `Norm who?' He said, ``He's Mr. Congressional
Comment.' So I phoned Ornstein, and he returned my call
immediately.''
   She felt flattered, then astonished.
   ``I asked him about Broyhill, and it was like pressing a button.
He just spit it all out, everything I wanted to know,'' said Ms.
Moriarty, who was grateful for Ornstein's punchy one-liners but a
bit embarrassed that she'd never heard of him before.
   ``I just didn't realize he was such a big cheese,'' she said.
   Journalists praise Ornstein for his insider's savvy, his
accessibility and his ability to cut quickly to the essence of a
complex subject in lively, easy-to-understand language.
   ``He's a master of the pithy quote,'' says Peggy Robinson,
senior political producer for public TV's ``MacNeil-Lehrer
NewsHour,'' where Ornstein frequently appears as a guest
commentator.
   ``I try to restrain myself and not quote Ornstein too often,''
says Helen Dewar, congressional correspondent for The Washington
Post. ``But when I'm analyzing a situation, I'm frequently curious
what he thinks. And he will unfailingly say something I just have
to quote. It's too good to pass up. No one puts it so concisely or
so well.''
   How did Ornstein become Washington's most quotable man?
   ``I was sitting in a Laundromat a couple of blocks from near my
apartment on Capitol Hill in the early 1970s, twiddling my thumbs
while my clothes were in the dryer,'' he recalled.
   He'd just finished reading a book about former Harlem
congressman Adam Clayton Powell, and thought it would make for an
interesting book review.
   ``I had a yellow pad and a pen, so I just dashed off a review in
an hour, and sent it to the Post. They printed it on the front page
of the Style section with a picture.''
   A short time later, he talked to a feature writer about his
favorite country inns. His quotes popped up in a Page One story in
the Wall Street Journal. ``I was thunderstruck,'' Ornstein said.
And bitten by the media bug.
   He started writing reviews and Op-Ed pieces for the Post and The
New York Times, which led to stints as a commentator and
documentary editor for public television, which led to appearances
on network TV talk shows.
   As his visibility grew, reporters started calling him for quotes
to lend an authoritative ring to their stories. Ornstein happily
obliged.
   ``I had a pretty good feel for what journalists were looking
for, and I found frankly that it served my own interests,'' he
said. ``I could learn an awful lot by talking to reporters who were
working on stories in ways that I didn't have the time to do
myself. There could be a pooling, a sharing of information.''
   To keep abreast of things, Ornstein, 41, reads voraciously _ at
least five newspapers every day plus stacks of magazines and
academic journals. He goes to Capitol Hill three days a week to
roam the corridors. He spends about two hours a day talking to
journalists.
   He attends luncheons, seminars, receptions and speaking events
to ``schmooze and pick things up.'' He even quizzes fellow airline
passengers and fathers on the sidelines of neighborhood soccer
games.
   Spoofing Ornstein's supposed omniscience, the irreverent New
York magazine Spy peppered a special Washington edition last month
with no fewer than 17 opinions from Ornstein on everything from
taxi fares to sex scandals. President Bush ranked second with 14
references.
   ``One of Spy's editors called to say they'd gotten hundreds of
letters,'' Ornstein said with a chuckle. ``Most of them asked, `Who
the hell is this guy Norman Ornstein?'''

   Here are some quotes from political scientist
Norman Ornstein:
   
   On passage of the congressional pay raise:
   ``It's a zero issue, it's gone. For all of Ralph Nader's
challenges and for all of the radio talk shows, the public is not
paying attention to this issue.''
   
   On a proposal by Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., to cut payroll
taxes:
   ``I don't think Moynihan proposed (it) with the expectation that
it would actually happen. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think he proposed
it for the shock value.''
   
   On special interest groups paying for travel by members of
Congress:
   ``You're going to have much more luck slamming a guy for doing
it on public expense than at the expense of private interests. The
public reaction is `We don't give a damn if it's taken out of
special interests, but don't take it out of our pockets.'''

   Shifting winds pushed an oil slick from
the supertanker Mega Borg northeastward Sunday, buying officials a
little more time to prepare for when it reaches shore, the Coast
Guard said.
   ``It's switched from traveling north-northwest to
north-northeast overnight,'' said Petty Officer Mark Sedwick.
``That was good because it bought us some time, staying parallel to
shore. Now, it's running east of Galveston and towards Louisiana.
But that could change.''
   Officials alerted communities north of Galveston to Louisiana
that the tar balls may not be far away.
   Coast Guard officials late Sunday predicted tar balls from the
spill would hit land Tuesday.
   ``It's moving slow. It didn't move any significant amount
today,'' Petty Officer David Oney said.
   The 30-mile slick, which lingered about 11 miles offshore, had
stretched into a light sheen in places and continued to drift
slowly away from the tanker, crippled 57 miles offshore from
Galveston since a June 8 explosion. But officials said Sunday that
the leaking had apparently stopped and the threat of a new fire had
ebbed.
   Coast Guard officials also lowered the spill estimate from 4.6
million gallons to 3.9 million gallons. Officials said Sunday that
salvage crews found approximately 700,000 gallons of oil in smaller
tanks that catch runoff from the larger tanks on the ship.
   Meanwhile, officials said oil-eating microbes spread over part
of the slick appeared to have done their job, but another
experiment using the bacteria was launched Sunday to make sure.
   Emergency cleanup crews had expected the Angolan crude to begin
washing ashore late Sunday near Galveston, but a morning flyover
showed the slick moving north-northeast of the area.
   The Coast Guard predicted early Sunday that the tar balls could
begin showing up in a 45-mile stretch of coastline from High
Island, some 30 miles north of Galveston, to Sabine Pass at the
Texas-Louisiana border.
   ``It's not as bad as it would have been, if it would have hit
Galveston Bay _ there's not an estuary up there _ but it's still
bad,'' said Houston Audubon Society President Gary Clark.
   The area includes small, sandy beaches and thick marshland, and
contains several national wildlife refuges, including one on the
Louisiana side.
   Meidt said if the slick moved toward the pass, the Sabine River
water flowing into the gulf would act as a natural barrier, pushing
the oil farther into the gulf. But Sedwick said if it hit
marshland, it will be more difficult to clean up.
   ``The best-case scenario is a sandy beach,'' Sedwick said.
``It's easier to clean up a nice, sandy beach than it would be a
marshy area. So that's what we're hoping for.''
   Coastal areas in eastern Texas and western Louisiana are largely
marshland.
   ``If it hits the marshlands, it seeps into the ground and kills
off the vegetation and the eggs in that area,'' Clark said, adding
that birds could starve. ``If it gets into those marshlands, it's
going to be there a while.''
   Still, he said, it could have been much worse if the slick had
hit Galveston Bay, where brown shrimp and many fish-eating sea
birds are breeding.
   Clark said the society has set up a bird-saving team.
   The Texas General Land office has trained hundreds of volunteers
to work on the cleanup in sessions in Galveston and Angleton on
Saturday and in Austin last week. Land Commissioner Garry Mauro
said 1,200 volunteers from the state's Adopt-A-Beach program are
ready to help once the oil comes ashore.
   Salvage crews working on the Norwegian tanker Sunday began
transferring oil from a leaking cargo bin to another holding tank
aboard the vessel, cutting off the flow of oil into the water.
   ``The ship has definitely quit leaking,'' Sedwick said. ``A
reconnaissance crew flew over at 6 this morning and didn't find any
oil within 5 miles of the ship. That's a pretty good indication
that they've stopped the leak.''
   He said crews from Smit America Salvage Inc. also began pumping
water out of another holding tank that had become flooded during
firefighting efforts. Once the oil transfer and the water release
are complete, Sedwick said, crews will decide when to begin moving
the remainder of the ship's 38 million-gallon cargo to a smaller
vessel, a process called lightering. He expected that to begin
Monday.
   On Saturday, crews had continued dousing the hull of the Mega
Borg with cooling water so it would not reignite when the oil
transfers began. Sedwick said Sunday officials believed there was
no longer a threat of a reflash.
   Divers attempting to rescue five loggerhead sea turtles spotted
Saturday near the leading edge of the slick had been unable to
locate the reptiles, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration said. But NOAA planned to continue searching for the
members of the threatened species.

<TEXT>
   The leading right-wing opposition party
appeared headed for control of Congress after voters dealt a major
blow to President Rodrigo Borja in congressional elections,
unofficial returns indicated.
   The results of Sunday's balloting _ the leftist president's
popularity has dropped over his failure to keep down inflation _
were likely to bring an end to several years of political calm in
this small Andean nation.
   The conservative Social Christian Party of former President Leon
Febres Cordero gained 11 seats and will control 18 seats in the
72-member Congress, according to returns compiled by three national
television stations.
   The unofficial returns showed Borja's Democratic Left party
losing half of the 30 seats it held. Official results will not be
available for a week.
   Analysts said the Social Christians would be able to dominate
the legislature through pacts with smaller parties.
   Ecuador has 15 registered political parties and at least a dozen
were expected to win seats in Congress.
   Sixty seats were contested in the elections. The seats have
two-year terms.
   Twelve seats with national constituencies have four-year terms
and will not be contested until 1992.
   Borja, who has served two years of his four-year term, has seen
his popularity undermined by his failure to keep a campaign promise
to reduce inflation from more than 50 percent last year to 25
percent.
   Febres Cordero has warned that when Congress convenes Aug. 10,
his party ``will put President Rodrigo Borja and his incompetent
ministers in their place.''
   Borja and Febres Cordero, a fiery conservative who governed from
1984 to 1988, are bitter political enemies.
   The Democratic Left has dominated the unicameral legislature
through an alliance with seven Christian Democratic congressmen.
That enabled Borja to push through his economic program and avoid a
clash of powers between Congress and the executive branch of
government.
   Democratic rule was restored in 1979 after a decade of
dictatorship. The three presidents who preceded Borja faced
opposition-controlled legislatures that blocked government
initiatives and sparked disputes.
   Borja took office in August 1988 after defeating populist Abdala
Bucaram in an election runoff in May of that year. He pledged to
bring rising inflation under control, but has fallen far short of
his target of 25 percent.
   Inflation hit a record 85.6 percent in 1988. The government was
able to lower it to 54 percent last year by restricting spending.
   In Quito on Sunday, soldiers armed with assault rifles guarded
polling stations as voters, including colorfully dressed highland
Indian women, lined up by the dozens. Many balloters said they
wanted to vote early so they could catch the World Cup soccer
matches on television.
   More than 5.2 million Ecuadorans were registered to cast
ballots. Voting is required by law in this Colorado-sized nation on
the northwest shoulder of South America.
   The were no reports of election violence.

   The death toll from flash floods that
swept through a rural area of eastern Ohio rose to 20 Sunday as
searchers dug along two creeks and dived into the Ohio River.
Sixteen people remained missing.
   Workers used shovels and picks to dig along the creek banks, and
sifted through debris at places marked with red flags, where search
dogs indicated they'd detected human scents, said National Guard
Capt. Jim Boling.
   Divers worked where the two creeks empty into the Ohio.
   Four bodies were found Sunday. But two of those were not
immediately identified, and the list of missing was not revised to
account for them.
   The number missing dropped to 16 with the other two bodies and
the removal of two other names: a woman who called to say she was
safe and a person who authorities weren't sure lived in the area,
said coroner's investigator Chuck Vogt.
   The 20th victim was pulled from the mouth of Pipe Creek at the
Ohio River, about seven miles south of Shadyside, Vogt said.
Another body was found in debris along Wegee Creek, and two bodies
were found earlier in the Ohio, he said.
   That brought the confirmed death toll in Thursday's floods to
20, including five children.
   Twenty-three dog teams from four states were searching for
victims, said Boling. The digging will continue at least through
Tuesday, said Fire Chief Mark Badia.
   ``The thing you find once you start into these brush piles and
piles of trees are cars, and they have to be torn apart and
searched separately,'' Badia said. ``Everything you turn up creates
a different situation.''
   But Vogt said he doubted many of the missing would be found
alive.
   ``It's just been too long. I don't think there's anybody alive
out there,'' he said. ``You can't swim out there that long in the
Ohio River.''
   The Wegee and Pipe creeks overflowed Thursday night during
storms that poured 5{ inches of rain onto eastern Ohio in 3{ hours.
The floods destroyed as many as 70 houses and damaged up to 40
others.
   Authorities said Friday that 60 people were missing; some of
those were later found dead, while others notified authorities that
they were safe.
   Officials also learned that some of those feared missing had
moved out of the area. Officials were comparing county property
lists and data from the Census Bureau with information from
residents and relatives, Boling said.
   Investigators Sunday blamed the flash floods on an unusually
heavy rainstorm that overwhelmed the designed flow capacities of
threebridges over the creeks. Badia said rainwater running down
hillsides forced debris into the creeks, forming dams at each
bridge. The ``dams'' broke under the water pressure.
   ``Eventually the bridges couldn't hold any more. The debris
broke loose, and that's when we got three big gushes of water,'' he
said.
   As rescue efforts continued, the National Guard cleared roads
and bridges leading into the stricken area.
   Eighteen Ohio counties have been declared federal disaster areas
since tornadoes and flooding first struck May 25.
   Across the border in West Virginia, Gov. Gaston Caperton said
Sunday he had no precise dollar figure on damage from flooding
Friday along a five-mile stretch near New Martinsville and in
nearby Ohio County, but estimated it will run into millions of
dollars.
   No deaths or serious injuries were reported.
   Caperton toured flooded areas in Wheeling and the Doolin Run
community near New Martinsville. He said he saw ``tremendous
devastation'' to hundreds of houses, house trailers and cars.
   State Public Safety Secretary Joseph Skaff estimated that
repairing and replaceing bridges and roads will cost about $750,000.
   National Guard soldiers helped with cleanup Sunday.

   Women are still being excluded from groups
studied in federal health research projects despite an official
policy that requires they be represented, congressional
investigators said today.
   The National Institutes of Health ``has funded some projects
that studied only men, even though the diseases being researched
affect both men and women,'' Mark V. Nadel of the General
Accounting Office said in testimony prepared for a congressional
hearing.
   Reps. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., and Olympia Snowe, R-Maine,
who lead the Congressional Caucus for Women, called on NIH to take
immediate action to eliminate sexism in medical practices and
include women in research paid for by the federal government.
   ``The research community and NIH's attitude has been to consider
over half the population as some sort of special case,'' said Ms.
Snowe. ``Their attitude has been like that old song from the
musical `My Fair Lady:' `Why Can't a Woman Be More Like a Man?'''
   In a statement, Mrs. Schroeder told the House Energy and
Commerce health subcommittee that ``gender difference is just not
considered to be good science. And since most research is conducted
on men to begin with, that too often means women get left in the
dark.''
   William F. Raub, acting NIH director, also was called to testify
om his agency's performance.
   Nadel, whose agency is the investigative arm of Congress, said
NIH has made little progress in implementing a 1986 policy that
women be included in research study populations unless it would be
scientifically inappropriate to do so.
   He cited a study of 22,000 male physicians begun in 1981 by the
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute that determined that men
who took an aspirin every other day reduced their incidence of
heart attacks.
   ``Institute officials told us women were not included in this
study, because to do so would have increased the cost,'' Nadel
said. ``However, we now have the dilemma of not knowing whether
this preventive strategy would help women, harm them or have no
effect.''
   Mrs. Schroeder, who with Ms. Snowe requested the study of NIH
practices, said American women are concerned about the low
investment in women's health issues.
   ``Just ask the almost 150,000 women who will develop breast
cancer this year,'' she said. ``One in every nine American women is
currently diagnosed with the disease, compared with one in every 20
in 1961. Yet we currently spend only $17 million a year on basic
breast cancer research.
   ``Earlier this year, the National Cancer Institute refused to
fund a major study on the effect of diet in reducing the risk of
breast cancer and heart disease in women,'' Mrs. Schroeder added.
   She said, too, that American women have fewer contraceptive
options available to them than European women and women in many
developing countries and that there is great need for research into
treatment of infertility.
   ``Sexism in medical practices is a reality,'' Mrs. Schroeder
said. ``For some women, there are fatal consequences.''
   She said the women's issues caucus will propose legislation next
month to bar the arbitrary exclusion of women from federally funded
research.

   Less than a month before Jane Pauley's
prime-time program premieres on NBC, she still doesn't know what to
call it.
   ``You know, my son was almost 4 years old before he got a
name,'' she said in TV Guide's June 23 issue. ``I had a cat that
was a year old before I gave him a name.''
   She knows what she doesn't want to call it _ a newsmagazine.
   ``It's a news variety show,'' said Pauley, who quit the
``Today'' show earlier this year.
   An NBC prime-time news program by any name is a risky venture.
The new show, premiering July 11, follows a host of short-lived
newsmagazines.
   There was ``Prime Time Sunday,'' which became ``Prime Time
Saturday'' before it was canceled, ``NBC Magazine,'' ``Monitor,''

   George Steinbrenner, the shipbuilding
magnate and unpredictable owner of the New York Yankees, told
graduating cadets at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy to dare to
be different.
   ``Be the uncommon man and woman,'' Steinbrenner urged the 119
cadets Sunday. ``Don't worry too much about what you think society
dictates, because it's the uncommon men of this country that have
led it to greatness.''
   Steinbrenner, who has hired 19 managers in the 17 years since he
bought the Yankees, pressed the graduates to ``pursue excellence at
all costs.''
   ``There are those who will teach you that to win is a bad
word,'' said the owner of the last-place ballclub. ``It's not a bad
word, but if you prefer to say pursuit of excellence, that's OK.''
   Steinbrenner was given a honorary doctorate ``in recognition of
his service in the American maritime industry.''
   He is president and chief executive of American Ship Building
and Kinsman Marine Transit.

   Bob Castleberry doesn't have to work
anymore since winning $10 million in the Publishers Clearing House
Sweepstakes, but he's putting in long hours in his new job as mayor.
   After winning the sweepstakes a year ago, Castleberry quit his
sales job with a business forms company and sought the mayor's job
in this city of about 50,000 people 35 miles from Dallas.
   Since his election in May, he said, ``I'm just having a great
time!''
   He attends meetings of every city board and commission _ not to
talk, but to watch and learn, he said.
   ``I know people think I'm crazy, that I should be out somewhere
traveling, taking a trip around the world, instead of coming down
here to City Hall every day,'' Castleberry said in a recent
interview.
   ``But I get bored with traveling and want to come home. This _
being mayor _ you feel as if you are helping people, helping to
make Denton a better place to live.''

   Throat problems have forced Madonna
to cancel or reschedule the final U.S. shows of her ``Blond
Ambition'' tour.
   The singer, who appears in the film ``Dick Tracy,'' which opened
this weekend, has chronic laryngitis, Warner Bros. Records said
Sunday.
   The June 19 concert at the Meadowlands was moved to June 25, and
the June 23 show was canceled. Shows on June 20, 21, and 24 will go
on as scheduled.
   Throat problems also forced the singer to cancel a Friday
concert in Philadelphia. It was the third show canceled in the last
three weeks by the singer, who started the tour six weeks ago.

   NEW YORK _ Gloria Estefan of the Miami Sound Machine, who broke
her back in a bus crash in March, says she had always feared
becoming an invalid.
   ``I've had a premonition all my life that I would become a
burden to the people I love,'' the 32-year-0ld singer said in the
June 25 issue of People. ``That's why when we began building our
house (in 1987), I had an elevator put in.''
   Estefan said when she was lying in her tour bus after it was
rear-ended by a tractor-trailer March 20, ``I thought, `Here it is.
This is the thing I've been waiting for.'''
   The singer has been working out on exercise machines three times
a week and has recovered to the point she can put on her shoes by
herself.
   Although the recovery could take a year, Estefan said he is
anxious to get back on stage ``and be better than before, to show
people that their prayers were not wasted.''

<HEAD>Budget Talks Should Get Serious This Week</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Late this week, budget talks between the Bush
administration and Congress should evolve from preliminary,
technical discussions into hard bargaining with election-year
politics and billions of dollars at stake.
   But none of the participants pretends to know what will happen.
   ``I wouldn't hazard a guess,'' said one, Senate Budget Committee
Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn. ``These things can go on for so
long, and then suddenly as if by magic you seem to reach a critical
mass and then there's an agreement.''
   After five weeks and eight private sessions, the Democratic and
Republican sides agree that somewhere between $45 billion and $60
billion in new taxes and spending cuts are needed for fiscal 1991,
which starts Oct. 1.
   Unless some deal is worked out by that date, the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law will force tens of billions of dollars worth
of spending cuts, an amount both parties say is intolerable.
   Yet neither side is eager to be the first to lay a plan on the
bargaining table at sessions continuing this week, and risk being
accused of championing something that the voters might find
dreadful.
   Among the battlegrounds: will Democrats have to swallow cuts in
some of their favorite social programs? And will President Bush's
campaign mantra of ``No new taxes'' become obsolete?
   Democrats say the bargaining can only begin with a concrete
offer from Bush, who called for the talks early last month.
   ``I thought implicitly at the beginning that the administration
would present a proposal here,'' Sasser said last week.
   But Republicans say there is no need for the White House to lay
down a proposal, and it has no plans to do so.
   If Democrats continue to insist that Bush present a budget
proposal, ``It would be clear at that point that the Democrats
don't intend to work out an agreement,'' said a GOP bargainer, Sen.
Phil Gramm of Texas.
   Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, a Republican negotiator who will
retire from Congress this winter, said he might be willing to push
a plan forward if no one else will.
   ``If they need a fall guy, and it's said that lame ducks are
good at that kind of stuff, I wouldn't mind being put in that
position,'' he said.
   But that's not likely to satisfy Democrats.
   ``We're not interested in hearing from Republican legislative
members,'' said Sasser. ``That's not what it's all about. This is a
negotiation between the executive and legislative branches.''
   Contributing to the unpredictability of the talks is the
schizophrenic outlooks of the Democratic and Republican teams.
   Each side has pragmatists like White House budget director
Richard Darman and House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta,
D-Calif. They seem above all to want a deal that once and for all
takes a bite out of the federal deficit, which some project could
exceed $200 billion next year.
   But the two teams also have highly partisan members, such as
Sasser and White House chief of staff John Sununu, who seem leery
of agreeing to anything that might provide a campaign advantage to
the other party.
   Bargainers say the litmus test for the talks will be whether
they have accomplished anything by the start of Congress' July 4
recess. They argue that agreement is needed by around then for
lawmakers to have time this year to enact a deficit-reduction
package.
   ``Everyone feels that if we work day to day until then, we ought
to be either well on our way to putting an agreement together or be
pretty much facing a task that's harder than everybody thought,''
said Panetta.

   A roadside vendor sells a watermelon for cash.
A doctor treats a plumber in exchange for a faucet repair. A giant
corporation exaggerates a deduction. And the federal tax gap gets
bigger.
   The gap between federal income taxes owed and paid voluntarily
is expected to swell to $100 billion this year and to as high as
$127 billion two years from now. That does not include uncounted
billions more taxes owed on income from illegal sources.
   Although the dollar figure grows, the tax gap is about the same
17 percent of taxes owed that it was when the Internal Revenue
Service began keeping the statistics in 1973.
   Viewed another way, individuals and businesses pay about 83
percent of their income taxes without further prodding by the IRS
and avoid the rest chiefly by under-reporting income and
overstating deductions.
   That is not good enough for Congress, which is interested in any
painless way to reduce the budget deficit, or for the IRS, whose
leaders fear more and more Americans will join the ranks of tax
cheats if they see evidence that others are getting away with it.
   The latest analysis by the IRS indicates that businesses,
ranging from the Mom-and-Pop grocery stores to lawyers to big
corporations, are responsible for more than 60 percent of the gap.
   The worst offenders are one-owner businesses and ``informal
suppliers,'' the IRS's designation for sellers _ child-care
providers, home repairmen and roadside vendors, for example _ who
usually deal in cash and seldom maintain a regular place of
business. Those two groups account for more than one-quarter of the
tax gap.
   Nobody has a quick solution. But lawmakers, IRS officials and
non-government experts agree on the problems:
   _Not enough tax returns are audited. Fewer than 1 percent of
individuals and 2 percent of corporations will be audited this
year. However, IRS officials point out that about 40 percent of
individuals, whose incomes are almost entirely from wages, interest
and dividends, get what amounts to an automatic audit because their
returns are matched by computer against documents that list their
earnings.
   IRS enforcement actions _ mainly audits and stepped-up
collection measures _ reduce the tax gap by about $22 billion a
year.
   _Too few people go to jail for cheating. Despite an almost
legendary reputation for criminal investigation _ it took the IRS
to get Al Capone _ the fact is the IRS brings criminal charges for
tax violations against fewer than 3,000 people a year. The figure
is declining.
   ``There is a general perception in the service (IRS) that
criminal tax enforcement has become too much oriented toward drug
dealers and the illegal sector and as a result, there is not enough
threat to ordinary citizens to be a credible deterrent,'' says
Peter Scott, former acting chief counsel for the IRS who now is
with Coopers &amp; Lybrand accountants.
   _Requiring the IRS to share in budget cuts of the last several
years has been counterproductive, because the agency collects $200
for each $1 it spends. Its collection division has been especially
hurt.
   Over the years, the IRS has built up a backlog of accounts
receivable _ assessed but uncollected taxes _ that totals about $87
billion and involves 13 million taxpayers. The agency says as much
as half that will never be collected because of death, bankruptcy
or other reasons.
   _The IRS is plagued with high turnover, often outgunned by
high-priced corporate lawyers and prone to mistakes. Its computers
crank out erroneous tax-due notices that seem almost impossible to
correct. Employees, many of them temporary workers, give the wrong
answer to at least one of every four tax questions. On average, the
IRS loses 70 percent of additional taxes assessed when a taxpayer
appeals.
   Closing the tax gap requires a better performance, IRS
Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr. told Congress earlier this year.
``Taxpayers are willing to pay what they owe,'' he said. ``They
cannot abide complexity, uncertainty, administrative burdens and
hassles with the IRS that may take months or years to resolve.''
   _IRS computers are woefully outmoded, but a decade-long
modernization costing upwards of $8 billion is under way.
   Any credit-card company can tell a customer the status of his or
her account within seconds. But IRS computers can't ``talk'' to
each other. When a tax return is processed in Austin, Texas, for
example, it must be keyed onto a tape, which then is flown and
trucked to the IRS computer center in Martinsburg, W.Va., to be
entered into a taxpayer's file.
   Slow computers affect more than taxpayer services. The General
Accounting Office says the IRS lacks sufficient data ``to either
identify the issues most responsible for the most troublesome
pockets of the tax gap or to track how well its programs reduce the
tax gap.''
   President Bush's IRS budget for 1991, up $635 million to $6.1
billion, would continue the computer modernization and pay for more
auditors and collectors and further improvements in taxpayer
services. The plan is designed to increase collections by $9
billion over five years.
   But the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents IRS
workers, says the percentage of returns audited would drop and the
total of unpaid accounts would rise under Bush's budget. By
spending $4.2 billion more than proposed over the next five years,
the IRS could collect almost $25 billion more, the union says.

   Individuals and corporations underpaid federal
income taxes on their legal earnings by $94.2 billion in 1987, the
Internal Revenue Service estimates.
   This figure, expected to rise above $100 billion this year, is
called the tax gap: the difference between what is owed and what is
paid voluntarily, without any additional pressure by the IRS.
   Here, according to the IRS, is what accounted for the tax gap in
1987, the latest year for which detailed estimates are available.
The first figure is the dollar value attributable to each factor;
the figure in parentheses is that factor's share of the total gap.

<HEAD>Big Feedlots Continuing to Grow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Huge feedlots that turn out the choicest beef
have been increasing in number for many years, and an Agriculture
Department economist says the trend shows no sign of letting up.
   Fewer than 200 feedlots marketed more than half the nation's fed
cattle last year, said Ken Krause of the department's Economic
Research Service. All had capacities of 16,000 head or more.
   Less than 30 years ago, there were only 23 feedlots with
capacities of 16,000 head or more. And in 1962 those accounted for
only 8.3 percent of the 14.6 million fed cattle marketed.
   ``By 1980, fed cattle output had increased to 23.2 million head
while large lots had become more important in the feeding of the
increased fed cattle herd,'' he said in the June issue of Farmline
magazine.
   The largest feedlots continued to increase in the 1980s. Last
year, 198 of those fed produced about 51 percent of the nation's
output of fed cattle.
   Krause said new information collected by the USDA's National
Agricultural Statistics Service showed that 32 feedlots with
capacities of 50,000 head or more accounted for 17 percent of the
fed cattle marketed last year.
   ``Although NASS confidentiality rules do not permit
identification of the largest existing lots, several operators
indicated that their lots have 100,000-head, one-time capacity,''
he said.
   Typically, feeder cattle weighing 600 to 800 pounds are put in
the pens and fed a balanced diet made up of a ``concentrate''
(often corn or grain sorghum), a protein supplement such as soybean
or cottonseed meal and some silage or hay for roughage.
   After five months or so, the fattened ``finished'' cattle _ now
weighing 1,000 to 1,200 pounds _ are shipped to packing plants for
slaughter and distribution in the consumer pipeline.
   Krause said there has been a significant decrease in the number
of feedlots smaller than 1,000-head capacity. Those are often
associated with family-size farming operations that also produce
crops and perhaps other livestock.
   At the same time, the fed cattle industry _ meaning larger
feedlot operations _ has been shifting to four Great Plains states.
   ``In general, the location shift has been to Colorado, Kansas,
Nebraska and Texas, where over 71 percent of the cattle were
finished in 1989,'' Krause said. ``These four states finished only
28.5 percent of the fed cattle in 1962.''
   The decline of small feedlots, meanwhile, has been mainly in the
Corn Belt states. Iowa, for example, had 50,000 lots in 1962, most
of them small. Those turned out 18 percent of the nation's beef.
   By 1989, Iowa was down to about 16,000 feedlots, accounting for
just 8 percent of the nation's beef cattle.
   Krause said that while the number and importance of small
feedlots have declined the last 30 years, nationally they still
produced more than 16 percent of the fed beef last year.

   The South is the historic home of King Cotton,
but that was long ago. The king, or at least a large part of the
royal family, has moved farther west.
   In 1987, according to an Agriculture Department analysis, six of
the 10 the largest cotton counties _ in terms of value of
production _ were in California and Arizona.
   ``In fact, in that year, the value of cotton sales from Fresno
County (Calif.) alone exceeded the combined sales of Alabama,
Georgia, Florida, the Carolinas and Virginia,'' the report said.
   The top three cotton counties by value of sale in 1987 were
Fresno, Kern and Kings in California's San Joaquin Valley.
   Combined with three other valley counties _ Merced, Madera and
Tulare _ the six California counties ``produced about $890 million
in cotton sales in 1987 _ rivaling the $970 million produced in all
counties east of the Mississippi River,'' the report said.
   Among the other top cotton counties in 1987, eight are in Texas,
five in Mississippi and three in Louisiana.
   Here are the rankings of the top 25 counties in terms of sales
value in 1987:
   1. Fresno, Calif., $293,287,000.
   2. Kern, Calif., $226,281,000.
   3. Kings, Calif., $198,665,000.

<HEAD>PBS Considering Free Air Time for 1992 Presidential Candidates</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Presidential candidates and the major
political parties could get free air time on the PBS in 1992.
   Bruce Christensen, president of the Public Broadcasting Service,
said Sunday the idea would be under discussion for the next few
months.
   ``What we're looking for is the way to increase the political
dialogue,'' Christensen said in a telephone interview from Dallas,
where PBS' board of directors is meeting this week.
   He said the possibilities include several ideas recommended
Friday to top PBS officials by the John and Mary Markle Foundation
of New York.
   The foundation, which will present a study to the PBS board on
Tuesday, has offered to contribute $5 million of the estimated $15
million to $20 million that the project would cost.
   The Markle study recommends that PBS offer free air time in
blocks ranging from 2{ minutes to 15 minutes to the presidential
candidates and-or the political parties.
   The Markle plan was outlined in Sunday editions of The
Washington Post and The New York Times.
   Christensen predicted that most of the 337 public TV channels in
the PBS system ``will sign on to what we are doing.''

<HEAD>AIDS Vaccine Available by End of Decade, Government Expert Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By the end of the decade, a vaccine to combat
the AIDS virus likely will be available for widespread use, a
government AIDS expert says.
   Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of AIDS research at the National
Institutes of Health, said Sunday that ``the decade of the '90s
will see some important advances that will have a positive impact
on HIV-infected individuals.''
   ``Over the next several years, you'll see a real acceleration of
vaccine development, and hopefully by the end of the 1990s there
will be a vaccine that is available for widespread use,'' Fauci
said.
   An estimated 1 million Americans are believed to be infected by
HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, which can develop into the
AIDS disease.
   The Bush administration has come under fire from AIDS activists
and congressional critics for not spending enough money on AIDS
research and moving too slowly in approving new drugs to fight the
disease.
   The federal government is spending $1.16 billion in the current
fiscal year on AIDS research and the administration has recommended
an increase to $1.245 billion in fiscal 1991.
   Fauci appeared on the ABC-TV program ``This Week With David
Brinkley'' in advance of the sixth international AIDS conference,
which starts Wednesday in San Francisco.
   The conference, billed as the largest gathering to date of HIV
scientists, health care workers and policy-makers, will run through
June 24.

<HEAD>Anti-Abortion Leaders Vow to Keep Fighting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite perceived setbacks in opinion
polls, leaders of the country's largest anti-abortion group vowed
to keep fighting in the coming decades.
   The president of the National Right to Life Committee, which
wound up its three-day annual meeting Sunday, urged optimism in the
face of what he said were skewed public opinion polls, bad press
and ``turncoat'' politicians.
   ``You would not be able to tell here that we had suffered any
reverses,'' J.C. Willke said.
   Delegates bought buttons, bumper stickers and watched
anti-abortion videos.
   One poster showed an infant with the words: ``Kill her now and
it's considered murder. Kill her three months ago and it's called
abortion.''
   Willke said the committee's goals and tactics have not changed
since the Supreme Court gave states more power to regulate abortion
last year. The group's ultimate goal remains making abortion
illegal nationwide.
   Unlike groups such as Operation Rescue, the National Right to
Life Committee avoids clinic blockades and other front-line tactics
and focuses on lobbying, legislation and other political activity.
   Susan Smith, the organization's associate legislative director,
said the group is ``working uphill to counter the media hype that
the pro-abortion movement creates.'
   ``Ten, 20 years down the road I expect we'll be a little further
along than we are now,'' Smith said.
   One workshop at the convention was titled ``Working a Biased
Media to the Advantage of the Movement.''
   Public opinion surveys have frightened some politicians away
from the anti-abortion stance, said Richard E. Ryan, senior vice
president of the Texas-based polling company Tarrance &amp; Associates.
But he questioned the surveys' validity.
   Even though about 60 percent of those polled tend to favor
allowing abortion, some 50 percent to 60 percent also tend to favor
placing some controls on abortion, Ryan said.
   ``They are the mushy middle,'' he said. ``They want to have
their cake and eat it too.''

   Florida's electric chair and its ``man-made
lightning'' forever silenced the would-be assassin of Franklin
Roosevelt and jolted the life out of the charming Ted Bundy.
   Dubbed Old Sparky, the three-legged oak chair has killed 219
inmates in 66 years.
   But only the execution of John Spenkelink _ the first person in
the nation to be put to death against his will after the U.S.
Supreme Court reinstated the dealth penalty in 1976 _ has stirred
as much controversy in Florida as the recent botched execution of
Jesse Tafero.
   Because of Tafero's execution, in which 12-inch flames and
sparks leaped through the hood over his head, attorneys for poor
inmates want to ban the chair. They claim Tafero was burned alive
and that the chair is cruel and unusual punishment.
   That is the issue in the appeal of ``Black Widow'' killer Judi
Buenoano. The state Supreme Court on Friday granted her a stay to
give her lawyers time to pursue that argument.
   Ms. Buenoano was condemned for the 1971 poisoning death of her
husband. She is serving a life term for the 1980 drowning murder of
her paralyzed son.
   She stands to become the first woman to die in Florida's
electric chair since it came into use in 1924.
   Hewn from an oak tree by prisoners, the chair, which is at
Florida State Prison, replaced hanging. It has been used to execute
175 people convicted of murder, 43 convicted of rape and one
convicted of a fatal kidnapping.
   One of the most notorious to die in the chair was Giuseppe
Zangara, executed in 1933 for the shooting death that same year of
Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak. Cermak was fatally wounded in an
attempted assassination of President-elect Franklin Roosevelt in
Miami.
   An account of the execution said: ``Zangara muttered in
deliberate, measured tones: `The rich are a bunch of scrum, the
rich are a bunch of' _ Just then, a switch clicked and the man-made
lightning struck through its appointed target and forever silenced
the muttering voice.''
   After a 15-year lull caused in part by a U.S. Supreme Court
ruling that put the death penalty on hold, executions resumed in
Florida in 1979 with Spenkelink. Unlike Utah's Gary Gilmore, the
first person executed after the death penalty's reinstatement,
Spenkelink did not go willingly.
   The best-known killer to die in Florida's electric chair was
Bundy, executed last year for the slaying of a girl. Bundy also was
convicted of murdering two college students in Tallahassee and was
believed to have killed as many as 50 women.
   Florida has executed 22 people since the 1976 U.S. Supreme Court
ruling, second only to Texas' 35. The latest person to die in the
chair was Tafero, on May 4.
   Witnesses said he appeared to breathe and move after the first
and second jolts. The malfunction opened a new avenue of appeals.
   ``An inmate about to be executed in Florida will likely be
burned and tortured during that execution, will be conscious during
the event, and will suffer pain,'' said the appeal filed in the
Buenoano case.
   Color photographs of the bodies of nine executed men accompanied
the appeals filed by state-paid attorneys in Buenoano's case and in
another death row case.
   After Gov. Bob Martinez ordered an investigation, the state
Department of Corrections concluded Tafero's death was instant but
that the mistaken replacement of a natural sponge with a synthetic
sponge had caused the burning.
   But the state-paid attorneys, who are from an agency that
represents poor death row inmates, maintain that the problem lies
with a faulty electrode that reduced the electricity from 2,000
volts to as low as 100 or 90.
   They blasted the department for testing the flammability of the
sponge by using a household toaster and alleged the problem had not
been fixed.
   Spokesmen for Martinez and Corrections Secretary Richard Dugger
said the state stood by its investigation. Dugger called the
allegations absurd.

<HEAD>U.S. War Dead Incorrectly Identified by North Korea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Last month, Communist North Korea
turned over what it said were the remains of five U.S. servicemen
killed in the Korean War. Now American officials say they're not
sure whose remains they have.
   The remains were handed over to to a U.S. congressional
delegation in an emotional Memorial Day ceremony in the truce
village of Panmunjom in what was billed as the first return of U.S.
Korean War dead since 1954.
   Only two of the five bodies were identified by name by the North
Koreans, based on dogtags they said were found with them. They were
U.S. Army 1st Lt. Jack J. Saunders, 27, of Ogden, Utah and Army
Cpl. Arthur Leo Seaton, 20, of Chester, Pa.
   But the United Nations Command said today that the bodies, which
were sent to the Army's Central Identification Laboratory in
Honolulu for identification, were not those of Saunders and Seaton.
   ``While North Korea has indicated name association for two of
the five remains, dental and physical characteristics of the
remains were compared with the dental and physical records of the
those two individuals, with negative results,'' the command said.
   The command said its findings were preliminary, but said it did
not appear that the other remains returned were those of Saunders
or Seaton either.
   ``Until the identification process is complete, we can't even be
sure they were the remains of Americans,'' the command added.
   The soldiers' relatives have been told of the findings, the
command said.
   The other three sets of remains were not identified by North
Korea, but it said at the time of the return that they were
believed to be those of another Army servicemen and two U.S. Air
Force members.
   All five were believed to have been prisoners of war who died in
Hwanghae Pukto province, south of North Korea's capital of
Pyongyang.
   Saunders and Seaton had been listed as missing in February 1951,
the Pentagon said. According to U.S. military, 8,172 U.S. soldiers
remain unaccounted for from the war.
   The return of the remains was widely seen as a sign of healing
and reconciliation after decades of emnity, an effort by North
Korea to improve relations with the United States.
   The two countries do not have diplomatic ties.
   The United Nations Command says 33,629 U.S. soldiers were killed
and 103,284 wounded in the war. More than 2 million Koreans were
killed.
   The 16-nation command, led by an American general, was formed at
the outbreak of the 1950-53 Korean War to help South Korea repel
invaders from the North.
   There were large-scale returns of remains of U.S. war dead in
1953 and 1954. Then, after years of no returns, the North Koreans
announced May 14 that they would turn over the remains of the five.
   Ho Jong, North Korean's deputy permanant representative at its
U.N. mission, said at the time that the Communist government was
prepared to discuss the return of more remains.
   He said the move was an ``eloquent illustration'' of North
Korea's wilingness to ``settle pending issues with the U.S.
government in a good way.''
   North Korea acknowledged for the first time in January 1988 that
it was still holding the remains of U.N. Command war dead.

<HEAD>Report: Traffic Controller Was Overruled Before Avianca Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decision to accept more planes per hour at
Kennedy Airport than an air traffic supervisor recommended may have
contributed to the crash of a fuel-starved Avianca jet, New York
Newsday reported.
   The jet crashed in Cove Neck on Jan. 25, killing 73 people,
after it had been placed in holding patterns for more than an hour
as it flew up the East Coast from Colombia.
   When the weather is good, Kennedy accepts about 60 planes an
hour. But the day of the crash, because of fog and rain, a local
air traffic supervisor recommended a flow of 22 planes an hour,
Newsday reported Sunday.
   However, his recommendation was rejected, the newspaper said.
   After consultations with officials, including the Federal
Aviation Administration's Central Flow headquarters in Washington,
the rate was set at 33 per hour, the newspaper said, citing
unidentified sources.
   Yet because of the bad weather, the airport barely landed 22
planes an hour, the newspaper said.
   ``The flow system fell apart,'' an unidentified source was
quoted as saying. ``It did not work the way it was supposed to
work. They (controllers) were playing a game of catch-up all
afternoon. They never caught up.''
   The jet's crew never declared a fuel emergency, which would have
enabled it to get priority to land before it ran out of fuel.
   An unidentified investigator told the paper that if the airport
had decided to accept fewer planes, there might have been fewer
ahead of the Avianca jet.
   The National Transportation Safety Board will hold hearings
Wednesday and Thursday on the accident.

   The dollar slipped against the Japanese yen today,
while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined in slow
trading in the absence of market-moving factors.
   The dollar closed at 153.88 yen, down 0.64 yen from Friday's
close of 154.52 yen. The U.S. currency opened at 153.77 yen and
ranged between 153.72 yen and 154.18 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed 161.60
points, or 0.50 percent, to close the day at 32,376.80. The index
had lost 129.71 points on Friday.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds fell to 87.70 points as of 3 p.m., down
from Friday's close of 87.79. Their yield rose to 7.035 percent
from Friday's close of 7.015 percent.
   Akihiko Kagawa, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, predicted the
dollar would move in a narrow range for the time being. ``There are
no fresh market-affecting incentives,'' he said.
   On the stock market, traders said many investors stayed on the
sidelines in the absence of market-moving factors.
   Volume traded in the first section totaled 300 million shares,
down from last Friday's 450 million shares.
   The day's trading was thin with small stocks with good movement
drawing buyers' attention, said Masahiro Umemori of Nomura
Securities Co. He said there appeared to be little factors that
would send the prices further downward. ``The (yen-dollar) exchange
rate is stable and there seem to be no big factors that would
bother the investors,'' he said.

   Officials hope the second phase of an
experiment using oil-eating bacteria to break up a slick from the
wrecked Mega Borg will remove any doubts that the process works.
   On Friday, about 100 pounds of the bacteria was spread over an
acre of the slick caused by the Norwegian supertanker that exploded
June 8 in the Gulf of Mexico. The Coast Guard estimates 3.9 million
gallons of light crude spilled.
   A flyover Sunday showed little oil in the treated water, and the
microbes appeared to have done the job, state officials said. But
there was no conclusive proof, and a second test application began
Sunday.
   ``There certainly wasn't any oil over there,'' said Texas Water
Commission Chairman B.J. Wynne. But Wynne said it could not be
determined if the oil was removed by the microbes or currents or if
a buoy marking the treated area had moved.
   It was the first use of the process _ called bioremediation _ on
open water. The process was used this year to clean rocks fouled in
Alaska by the Exxon Valdez spill in March 1989.
   The naturally occurring bacteria break oil down into a harmless
fatty substance that is eaten by fish.
   In the second application, the microbes were to be unleashed in
one area while another area would go untreated.

   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has called on Libyan
researchers to make a new push to develop an atomic bomb, according
to a news report monitored in London.
   The Libyan news agency JANA, as monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corp., quoted Gadhafi as urging scientists Sunday to
``work day and night'' to build a nuclear weapon ``in defiance of
America.''
   He also called for development of Libyan space technology.
   ``America manufactures missiles and puts above our heads
satellites,'' the Libyan leader was quoted as saying. ``This
provokes you and ignites in you the spirit of defiance and
revolution to reach space and manufacture the atom.'' He blamed the
United States for withholding technology Libya needs.
   Gadhafi also accused Israel of aiming nuclear weapons at Arab
cities, saying, ``This is unacceptable and we must work against
it.''

   A stowaway cat that survived a 48-day
journey from London without food or water may wind up being the
most expensive feline in Australia.
   Dozens of cat-lovers have called animal quarantine officials to
say they want custody of the roving feline, which arrived a week
ago in a shipping container with a Mercedes Benz. The shipping line
and the woman who owns the Mercedes are among those interested.
   But the stray's owner-to-be will pay dearly.
   A spokeswoman for the South Australia Department of Agriculture,
which runs Adelaide's animal quarantine station, says the black cat
must remain in quarantine for nine months. Australia has some of
the world's most stringent quarantine laws to keep out rabies and
other animal diseases.
   The tab for looking after the cat will come to at least 1,900
dollars ($1,480 U.S.), the spokeswoman said.
   A special meeting has been called for Tuesday to sort out the
would-be owners.

   An air show director was killed when his
stunt plane failed to come out of an intentional stall and crashed
nose-first in front of an estimated 75,000 people.
   ``When it hit, it just exploded,'' said Kevin Ellis, a spectator
Sunday at Will Rogers World Airport. ``No matter how fast the
trucks got there, he was dead. It was just a ball of fire.''
   Killed was Tom Jones, 46, a former national champion aerobatic
pilot and director of the Aerospace America '90 show.
   The Soviet-made Sukhoi-26M stunt plane never regained power
after Jones performed a straight-up stall called a tail slide.
   The announcer said, ``OK, Tom, OK, looking good _ you can pull
up,'' just before the plane hit the ground in a grassy area 100
yards from the crowd.
   Many in the crowd captured the crash on home video cameras.
   All civilian performances at the air show were immediately
canceled. Military jets, bombers and helicopters performed fly-bys
in a tribute to Jones about two hours later. Jets flew the
missing-man formation.
   Jones was a member of the 1988-89 world champion aerobatic team
and was the national aerobatic champion in 1988, air show spokesman
Mark House said.

   The hardest part after a killer flood, a
coroner's deputy says, is telling relatives a child has been lost.
   ``You expect death in the elderly, and it doesn't bother me,''
Chuck Vogt, the Belmont County Coroner's investigator, said Sunday.
``But death in the young ... that's hard. They've never had a
chance.''
   It is Vogt's job to notify relatives of people who were killed
after 5{ inches of rain fell in about three hours in eastern Ohio's
Belmont County on Thursday and sent a wall of water crashing down
the Wegee and Pipe creek valleys.
   At least 20 people died and 16 were missing.
   Vogt, a lifelong resident of this town of about 4,700, said he
knew most of the dead and knew relatives of the others. He is
responsible for taking survivors to the morgue to identify the
remains of loved ones.
   ``I think that right now, it hasn't hit me yet. It'll hit me
later when all this has calmed down, and I'm sure I'll be a basket
case some time next week,'' Vogt said.
   He said it was especially hard to face the mother of Kerri
Polivka. Kerri was with Amber Colvin, a 9-year-old who was swept
seven miles down a creek and rescued Friday in the Ohio River.
   ``I see that girl's mother, the girl who was with Amber,'' Vogt
said, ``and she gives me that look that says `What have you found?
Can you tell me anything?'''
   Vogt said the worst of his job may still be ahead. He said he
did not expect any of the missing who were swept down the creek to
be found alive.
   ``It's just been too long. I don't think there's anybody alive
out there. You can't swim out there that long in the Ohio River,''
Vogt said.
   He said bodies submerged in the river would probably begin
surfacing today as gases in them accumulate.
   Vogt wasn't the only worker putting in overtime since the flood.
   The sirens that marked the first three days after the storm have
given way to the roar of bulldozers and dump trucks. Automobiles,
crushed by the water or wrapped around trees like bow ties, were
taken out on National Guard flatbeds.
   Pick-and-shovel crews worked ahead of most of the earth-moving
equipment, searching for victims in piles of debris where search
dogs indicated bodies might lie.
   ``If there's enough equipment in there _ I'm talking 'dozers and
trucks to haul it out and loaders to load it _ with enough
equipment and a month's time, they can clean up a lot of this
debris and get it out,'' said Don Keyfer, who drives a backhoe for
a construction company.
   It could take two years before the area is back to normal, he
said.

   A young bank executive broke into
his bank's computer security system and stole nearly $1.5 million
in Malaysia's biggest case ever of computer fraud, police said
today.
   The executive attracted suspicion when he bought a red
Lamborghini, three Porsches and a Mercedes Benz, the New Straits
Times daily newspaper said, citing police and banking sources. It
said the arrest was made Tuesday.
   Police confirmed that they had seized luxury cars the
24-year-old man had purchased. His identity was not disclosed.
   Shamsuri Arshad, deputy director of the criminal investigations
department of the federal police, said bank employees and other
potential witnesses were being interviewed.
   Banking sources said the executive was employed in the bank's
foreign exchange section. He apparently cracked the bank's computer
security system and transferred the money from the accounts of
several clients into his own personal account, they said.
   The money was then withdrawn over a six-month period, and the
bank discovered the funds were missing in a spot check by auditors,
the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Brass Band Festival Big Hit, May Become Annual Affair</HEAD>

   Organizers of the first Great American
Brass Band Festival are already trying to arrange an encore.
   Organizers estimated that more than 10,000 people turned out for
the festival, which featured the music of eight old-time ensembles.
The event ended Sunday.
   ``The measure of success is whether people came and had a good
time,'' festival co-chairman George Foreman said. ``And there's
bound to be some way to do it again next year.''
   Activities at the Centre College campus in town began Thursday
and ranged from displays of antique bicycles to a hot-air balloon
race.
   Groups in Saturday's concert series spanned styles and periods.
The Civil War-era Regiment Band of the 11th North Carolina Troops,
for example, played opposite Danville's Advocate Brass Band,
vintage 1890.
   But the Olympia Brass Band from New Orleans came the farthest
and got the biggest response. When the group led a procession down
Main Street Saturday to the tune of ``When the Saints Come Marching
in,'' some spectators fell in behind and danced along.
   ``The atmosphere of this music can be experienced in Danville,
Ky., or New Orleans, La., just the same, providing people enjoy
it,'' said Milton Batiste, one of the band members. ``If people
enjoy what we do, the atmosphere is right anywhere we play.''

   Churchgoers lying on the floor prayed for
themselves and the gunman collecting their wallets during a holdup
in the middle of a Baptist service.
   The man, carrying a sawed-off shotgun, made off with credit
cards, checkbooks and at least $500 in cash Sunday morning from
more than 130 members of the Faith Way Baptist Church.
   Mary Gregory, the pastor's wife, said the gunman, wearing
sunglasses and a stocking mask, came in through the basement and
walked up the steps to the back of the sanctuary.
   ``He had a gun and he said, `This is a holdup. Everybody get
down,''' Mrs. Gregory said. ``Everybody was down and they were
praying and he was going around the pews and taking billfolds and
purses and things.''
   ``It seemed like he was there for an eternity, but actually it
was about 10 or 15 minutes,'' she said.
   The pastor, the Rev. Downing Gregory, said he ``thought this was
a prank of some sort. I just stood there and looked at him. Then
finally he said, ``Reverend, you bow your head, too.' I got down on
the floor.''
   The robber threatened the church's associate minister, who was
praying more loudly than others, Mrs. Gregory said.
   ``The man was getting irritated. They were praying for him, what
he was doing and that it was wrong,'' she said.
   As he left, the gunman told the congregation to pray for 15
minutes before getting up, the Gregorys said. Members remained on
the floor for two or three minutes, the pastor said.
   ``I had a time of praise and thanksgiving to thank God for
sparing our lives,'' he said.
   The day's collection was in the church office and was not
disturbed.
   ``We have a couple of elderly folks in church. I'm sure that's
what hurt most of all, the financial part,'' Gregory said.
   He said one woman had been saving for a pair of glasses, and a
91-year-old woman lost about $30 in grocery money.

<HEAD>New Party Could Grow From Communist Party Rift</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radical reformers are threatening to walk out of
next month's Communist Party congress if their demands are not met,
opening a rift that could lead to the creation of a new party.
   A conference of the reform faction Democratic Platform on Sunday
instructed its delegates to the party congress that begins July 2
to leave the session if delegates do not eliminate party control
over the armed forces, the KGB security police and other government
bodies.
   If the 4,700 delegates to the congress balk at those and other
demands, as seems likely, the group's estimated 100 delegates are
to quit and organize a new party by September.
   Factions have been banned in the Communist Party since 1922.
   Also Sunday, the mainstream Moscow city party organization
published a pre-congress platform that sharply criticized national
leaders for drifting into ``an ideological and organizational
crisis'' that was costing them support.
   ``The danger for the party today is a split among Communists who
support perestroika,'' said the Moscow party platform. It did not
directly mention Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The moves reflected the growing polarization of party politics
and widening dissatisfaction with Gorbachev's failure to push
reforms past conservatives who retain control of many government
and party bodies.
   Democratic Platform leaders claim to have the general support of
40 percent of the 18 million Communist Party members, a much higher
ratio than reflected in the composition of the party congress.
   But they say that only about 500,000 party members would take
the decisive step of actually leaving the party to form a new one.
   Democratic Platform, founded six months ago, has included Boris
N. Yeltsin, who last month was elected president of the Russian
republic, and also the new mayors of Moscow and Leningrad, Gavriil
Popov and Anatoly Sobchak. But they have cut their activities in
the group since their elections.
   The resolution adopted Sunday by the Democratic Platform, after
two days of often stormy debate, blamed the crisis facing the
Soviet Union in part on ``the inconsistency, indecisiveness, and
either incompetence or unwillingness of the leading (party)
structures to carry out a radical reform.''
   ``The polarization of political forces is accelerating,'' it
said.
   The group told members who are delegates to the party congress
to present a package of demands that include the transformation of
the Communist Party from a ``totalitarian type'' into a
``parliamentary type'' that would compete with other political
groups.
   The resolution demands the Communist Party divide its billions
of dollars worth of buildings, publishing houses, vehicles and
other assets among emerging political groups.
   Those steps would vastly reduce the role of the Communist Party.
Earlier this year, the party agreed to give up its constitutionally
guaranteed monopoly on power but has been slow to surrender its
privileges in society.
   The resolution published Sunday by the Moscow party
organization, the largest and most influential in the nation, was
not as radical as the Democratic Platform resolution. But it also
called for an end to party control over the armed forces, police
and KGB.
   It said that ``during the years of totalitarianism and
stagnation'' from 1929 until 1985, the party had developed ``a
non-democratic structure of power'' and that its mistakes had cost
many lives.

<HEAD>Furniture Designer Nakashima Dies At 85</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HOPE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Nakashima, a renowned designer of
wood furniture, has died at age 85.
   Nakashima, who was born in Spokane, Wash., died Friday evening
at his home. His family said he died after a brief illness.
   He was known for working with untrimmed slabs of wood,
especially black walnut and redwood. He often left holes and cracks
in the final product to capture the trees' character.
   In 1986, Philadelphia Museum of Art director Anne d'Harnoncourt
called Nakashima a ``national treasure.'' His work appeared in the
Museum of Modern Art in New York and in many galleries. The
American Craft Museum in New York last year staged a major
retrospective of his work.
   Nakashima's Altar for Peace at the Episcopal Cathedral of St.
John the Divine in Manhattan was dedicated New Year's Eve 1986 with
a concert directed by Leonard Bernstein.
   Nakashima graduated from the University of Washington and later
traveled to Japan and worked in the Tokyo offices of an American
architect. After designing a monastery dormitory, he married,
returned to the United States with his wife and opened a small
furniture shop in Seattle.
   The couple were imprisoned with other Japanese-Americans during
World War II, but his former employer, Antonin Raymond, arranged
for the Nakashimas to join him at his farm in New Hope in 1943.
   Nakashima is survived by his wife, Marion, a son, Kevin, and a
daughter, Mira Nakashima-Yarnall, who has taken over much of the
design work of her father's firm. Funeral services were scheduled
for today.

<HEAD>Cambodian Rebels Claim To Control Most of Central Province</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Cambodian rebel group said today it
had seized almost all of the central province of Kompong Thom _
just north of the national capital of Phnom Penh _ and briefly held
its capital city.
   The report could not be independently verified. In the past, the
guerrillas in the past have exaggerated military successes.
   If the claim were true, however, it would be a significant
development the provincial capital, Kompong Thom, is just 63 miles
north of Phnom Penh.
   The statement was from the forces of Prince Norodom Sihanouk,
one of three guerrilla armies fighting the country's
Vietnamese-installed government.
   The guerrilla groups have intensified attacks since September,
when Vietnam said it pulled its last troops out of Cambodia.
   The guerrillas seized several strategic areas, mostly in the
west and northwest bordering Thailand, only to have them retaken by
the government.
   Fighting has continued although Sihanouk and Prime Minister Hun
Sen on June 5 signed in Tokyo an agreement calling for military
self-restraint.
   Hopes for an early political settlement were set back with the
failure of talks last week between the deputy foreign ministers of
Vietnam and China. China is the major supplier of arms to the
guerrillas.
   In a statement, the guerrillas claimed they launched a
four-pronged attack on Kompong Thom city and seized it Sunday after
three hours of fighting.
   They said they withdrew after a few hours, though, ``due to the
large civilian population ... and for security reasons.''
   The rebels claimed to have seized three district towns in the
province in the past three weeks.
   ``As of yesterday, the entire province is totally in the hands
of the Cambodian national resistance forces,'' the statement said.

   Police will put homosexual officers and
community leaders on the front lines to handle security at this
week's Sixth International AIDS Conference, which activists have
pledged to disrupt.
   A ``first response team'' of 22 police officers, most of them
gay and lesbian, plus gay community leaders will try to pacify any
overly strident demonstrators inside Moscone Center, San Francisco
police said. The conference is scheduled to begin Wednesday.
   But none of the gay or lesbian officers is expected to make
arrests, said Jill Tregor of Community United Against Violence, a
member of the community squad.
   ``The department is scared of looking like the bad guys. They
are willing to try something new,'' Tregor said.
   ``We'll be trying to read the sentiments of the audience,'' she
added. ``If demonstrators want five minutes on the microphone,
maybe we can give them five minutes on the mike.''
   If the first law enforcement group is unable to deal with
protesters, a second tier ``arrest squad'' will be called from
inside Moscone, San Francisco police said.
   A third wave of security will supervise the throng of activists
expected outside the convention center.
   Police have said officers will be tolerant of peaceful civil
disobedience.
   ``We want to make sure the city looks good,'' Deputy Chief Fred
Lau said during a press briefing Friday. He said about 100 officers
would be based at the conference site, with others on standby.
   A battalion of officers who have undergone special AIDS
``sensitivity'' training will monitor AIDS activists using modified
forms of crowd control, primarily holding batons in less
intimidating positions, police said. But Lau added that officers
wouldn't let demonstrators get out of control.
   ``We'd like to maintain control of the barricade line,'' Lau
said. ``In the past, demonstrators have become overly zealous and
picked up the barricades.''

<HEAD>Latest Cease-Fire Breaks Down; Government, Tamil Rebels Clash</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 2-day-old cease-fire between
government troops and Tamil guerrillas collapsed today amid new
fighting.
   The truce, which began Saturday, had been marred by minor
attacks. By today, both sides reported exchanges of fire along Sri
Lanka's east coast and in the north.
   The government and the Tamil Tiger rebels had already accused
each other of using the cease-fire to fortify their positions and
to bring in supplies and reinforcements.
   Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne told Parliament the
government ``has been compelled'' to fight. A rebel spokesman,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said: ``The war situation
continues.''
   Ethnic Tamil militants took up arms against the
Sinhalese-dominated government in 1983 in their quest for a
separate homeland.
   At least 378 people have been killed since June 11, when the
rebels broke a 13-month-old truce. The death toll was compiled from
reports by witnesses, military sources and Tiger officials.
   Rebels in the east coast town of Batticaloa today set fire to
the police station they captured a week ago and streamed out of
town toward the jungle in jeeps, vans and small trucks, a local
journalist reported. Batticaloa is 140 miles northeast of Colombo.
   On Sunday, the rebels blew up a bridge outside Batticaloa in an
attempt to keep the army from advancing, the Tiger spokesman said.
Government troops hold an airstrip outside the town.
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said government forces
returned fire in at least two areas near Batticaloa and also near
the north central town of Vavuniya. Both areas were the scene of
fighting last week.
   Last week's battles began after the Tigers overran the
Batticaloa police station, then seized other stations in the region.
   At least 850 policemen, ordered by their government not to
return fire, surrendered to the Tigers last week. The fate of most
of them is still unknown.
   A survivor and military sources said at least 137 of the captive
policemen were gunned down by the Tigers after they surrendered.
   The government opened direct negotiations with the Tigers in May
1989 and implemented a cease-fire that had generally held until
last week.
   During the negotiations, the government pledged to delegate
provincial autonomy to the Tamils in the north and east. At the
same time, it allowed the Tigers virtually a free hand in the
region.
   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
are predominantly Hindu and claim the Sinhalese majority, who are
mostly Buddhist, discriminate against them in jobs and education.
Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of the population.
   More than 11,000 people have been killed since the insurrection
began.

   Space shuttle Atlantis was moved out

next month.
   It's the same pad that Columbia occupied until June 12, when the
shuttle was returned to the hangar for repair of a hydrogen leak.
Columbia's astronomy mission with the Astro observatory is
tentatively set for mid-August.
   Atlantis began the 3{-mile trip from the hangar to the launch
pad at 11:16 p.m. EDT Sunday night. The move takes six to eight
hours.
   The five crew members were expected to arrive later today for a
countdown demonstration test Wednesday and Thursday.
   The Pentagon mission, scheduled for mid-July, will be the
seventh of 36 shuttle flights dedicated to a classified, military

   Here is a brief look at the joint economic plan signed Sunday by
five Central American presidents at the conclusion of their
three-day economic summit in Antigua, Guatemala:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MAIN POINTS: The newly formed Central American Economic
Community will try to mesh the region's economies with coordinated
action on foreign trade and debt, on rebuilding infrastructures, on
agricultural and industrial policy and attracting investment.
   The Central American Economic Action Plan calls for creation of
a new set of rules in the region for eliminating obstacles to
integrated economic growth. It calls for the cutting of
bureaucratic red tape in the transportation of passengers and
freight in the region. It also calls for making customs and
migration procedures less complicated.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PARTICIPANTS: Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro
and Costa Rican President Rafael Calderon, both elected this year,
signed the plan as first-time participants in a regional summit.
Signing for Guatemala was President Vinicio Cerezo, for El
Salvador, President Alfredo Cristiani and for Honduras, President
Rafael Callejas. Panamanian President Guillermo Endara signed as an
invited observer.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   TIMING: Ongoing negotiations between the Central American
governments are necessary to turn the plan into action, the
presidents say in a six-page document. They say that within one
month bankers and financiers should set up a forum to handle
Central America's foreign debt.
   Within three months all countries in the region are to present
tariff regulations offering reciprocal treatment on trade duties
and government and private sector councils are to be in place to
allow a dialogue for development. A joint agriculture policy for
food exports and imports is to be designed within three months.
   Within six months, the presidents expect to have a program in
place for improved transportation, telephone, mail, electricity and
customs services. A strategy for boosting research, science and
technology would then be devised.
   Also within six months, a program should be devised to help
small businesses, underground enterprises and less affluent sectors
of society share in regional development.

<TEXT>
   Aides to Foreign Minister David Levy are angry
with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir for rebuffing American proposals
on starting Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, a leading Heberw daily
reported today.
   The Haaretz newspaper also said Levy blocked the delivery of a
message Shamir wanted to send to Egyptian leaders through the
Israeli Embassy in Cairo last week.
   Shamir's new right-wing government assumed power last week.
   Levy is the No. 2 man in the Likud bloc, and his aspirations to
eventually replace Shamir as Likud leader have caused past diputes
between the two.
   In Shamir's last Cabinet, Levy was a chief critic of U.S. peace
plans, but he has taken a more moderate stance since taking over
the Foreign Ministry.
   Levy's spokeswoman, Aliza Goren, said in a telephone interview
today that the reports of disagreement between Shamir and Levy were
``an exaggeration and blown out of proportion.''
   Levy, 52, was hospitalized last week after a mild heart attack.
He has begun working from his sickbed and is expected to be
released this weekend.
   Israeli-U.S. ties have been strained in the past year because of
disagreement over Middle East policies and the American dialogue
with the PLO, which Israel considers a terrorist organization.
   Haaretz said aides to Levy were annoyed by statements made
Friday by Shamir's top political adviser, Yossi Ben-Aharon.
   Ben-Aharon suggested on Army radio that Israel wanted to shelve
peace proposals raised last year by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III as a way to revive Israel's stalled initiative for
Palestinian elections.
   ``We are asking to start from the beginning,'' Ben-Aharon said.
   According to Haaretz, Levy's aides considered the remark, among
others coming from Shamir's office, to be ``unneccesary instigation
at a sensitive moment.''
   Haaretz did not say what was in the censored message to Cairo.
It said Ben-Aharon sent it to the Israeli Embassy in Egypt last
week and that Levy ordered staff members not to deliver it.
   The newspaper said Levy was angry that he had not been consulted
before the message was sent to Egypt, the only Arab country to make
peace with Israel and a key middleman in negotiations with the
Palestinians.
   Shamir himself sharply criticized the United States today for
continuing a dialogue with the PLO despite an aborted seaborne
attack May 30 that was claimed by a PLO faction.
   ``Week after week passes and they are still holding
consultations, there in the political offices in the United States,
about whether indeed the PLO is still a terrorist organization,''
Shamir told students in a speech in a Tel Aviv suburb.
   The United States has demanded that the PLO condemn the aborted
raid as a condition for continuing diplomatic contacts that began
18 months ago in the PLO's home base of Tunis. So far the PLO has
only indirectly criticized the action.

   Cardinal John J. O'Connor says a newspaper
column he wrote last week should not have been interpreted to mean
he supports excommunicating Catholic politicians who support
abortion rights.
   O'Connor said Sunday the column instead was intended to help
prevent excommunications.
   ``We don't want to see people excommunicated,'' O'Connor said at
a news conference. ``We're talking about ... trying in every way
possible to bring it about that individuals won't excommunicate
themselves.''
   ``I have never threatened to excommunicate anybody; I have never
suggested that any other bishop excommunicate anybody; I have no
intention of excommunicating anybody,'' he added.
   In the column in the Archdiocese of New York's weekly paper, the
cardinal said Roman Catholic officials risked being excommunicated
for supporting a woman's right to choose abortion.
   Those at risk, he wrote, are Catholics who ``are perceived not
only as treating Church teaching on abortion with contempt, but
helping to multiply abortions by advocating legislation supporting
abortion, or by making public funds available for abortion.''
   ``If such actions persist,'' he wrote, ``bishops may consider
excommunication the only option.''
   But he also read a portion of the column Sunday that said: ``To
have the power to impose penalties and to use that power ... are
two different things.''
   Excommunication is a rarely used sanction that bars a Catholic
from most sacraments.
   In an interview televised Sunday, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a
Catholic who says he is personally opposed to abortion but supports
abortion funding, reaffirmed his pro-choice position.
   Cuomo said on WNBC-TV's ``News Forum'' program that he still
favored public funding for abortion. But he said no Catholic could
feel good about a cardinal suggesting his soul was in peril.
   ``I love being governor,'' said Cuomo. ``I wouldn't do it if I
thought I were risking my soul.''

   Weekend revelers dancing on a wooden
balcony plunged eight feet to the ground when the rotting structure
collapsed and hit at least two people underneath, officials said.
   Fourteen people were injured Saturday at the fourth annual
Summer Fest, including two women caught under the balcony who were
seriously hurt.
   About 20 people were dancing on the 8-by-10-foot balcony of a
historic building during the arts and wine festival. The two women
caught underneath suffered back injuries and were listed in serious
but stable condition at San Jose Medical Center Sunday.
   A triangular support decayed because it was not treated to
withstand wet weather, said Scott Baker, city director of building
services.
   The accident occurred in the rear of the city's Old Town
shopping center, a historic Spanish-style elementary school
converted to house shops.
   Building officials will inspect Old Town for other structural
problems, but finding the dry rot would have been difficult during
normal maintenance and inspections because it was ``virtually
hidden,'' Baker said.
   Los Gatos is an affluent San Jose suburb on the eastern slope of
the Santa Cruze Mountains, about 60 miles south of San Francisco.
It was hard-hit by the 7.1 magnitude earthquake that hit Northern
California in October.

<HEAD>Party Chief Defends Policies In Letter To California Students</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Associated Press Writer&equals;
   BEIJING (AP) _ Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin, in a long
letter to nine California university students, defended last year's
military suppression of the pro-democracy movement.
   He acknowledged that the disintegration of communist rule in
Eastern Europe was a ``setback'' for socialism but said China will
not tolerate opposition to its socialist system.
   The official Xinhua News Agency today carried the text of the
letter it said was written to nine political science students from
California State Polytechnic University in San Luis Obispo.
   It said Ma Yuzhen, China's consul-general in Los Angeles,
delivered the letter to the students on Friday.
   Xinhua said the students had asked about China's current
policies in a March 8 letter to Jiang.
   Jiang, repeating previous government statements, said
authorities displayed ``maximum patience'' toward student
demonstrators last year. He said the military was only called in
when a small number of agitators used the student unrest in an
attempt to overthrow the Communist Party and the government.
   He said the Western press ``concocted a lot of false,
sensational stories'' about the crackdown, in which hundreds and
perhaps thousands were killed.
   Some foreigners, he said, ``based their judgment merely on their
own values.''
   Jiang said China wants good relations with the United States,
but in an apparent reference to U.S. criticism of China's human
rights record, he denounced ``foreign interference and bullying.''
   Jiang became party general secretary last June after his
predecessor Zhao Ziyang was purged for supporting the students.
   He indirectly criticized Zhao, saying ``divergent views'' on how
to respond to the democracy movement pushed the nation to the brink
of disintegration.
   Jiang said China's people today are ``living and working in
peace and contentment, (with) extensive democratic rights and
freedom unseen in our history.''
   He noted the demise of Communist governments in Eastern Europe
but said ``one should not conclude from this that socialism has
failed or collapsed.''
   Thousands of students and other activists from last year's
democracy movement remain in prisons without being formally
charged. Leaders of the movement have been accused of
``counterrevolutionary'' crimes.
   The closest Jiang came to expressing regret over the bloodshed
was when he said China should learn from the West and ``keep a
certain amount of police force armed with necessary non-lethal
weapons'' to put down disturbances.
   He urged Chinese who participated in pro-democracy
demonstrations while studying in foreign countries to return,
saying they would not be punished.
   It was Jiang's latest defense in the United States of last
year's June 3-4 crackdown. In an interview last month on ABC's
``20-20'' television news program, he said the Western outcry over
the killings was ``like much ado about nothing.''

   The Soviet helicopter pilot hailed as a hero for
trying to douse the meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor was
near death today after a lung infection worsened during leukemia
treatments.
   Anatoly Grishchenko, 53, was listed in critical condition at
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center with a high fever and a lung
infection. He has been on a respirator since early Friday.
   Grishchenko showed no signs of improvement and doctors said his
chance of surviving the infection were poor, center spokeswoman
Susan Edmonds said Sunday.
   ``He's the same, there's been no changes,'' she said. ``My
understanding is he's sedated but cognizant of what's going on
around him. He does recognize people who are there.''
   His wife, Galina, and a cousin were with him, Ms. Edmonds said.
   Grishchenko was stricken by the infection last week, after
undergoing a bone-marrow transplant to fight leukemia linked to
radiation exposure.
   Grishchenko repeatedly flew his heavy-lift copter through the
intensely radioactive gases spewing from the Chernobyl plant,
dumping sand and cement in an overmatched effort to cap the
crippled reactor.
   He and a handful of others in the operation were designated
heroes of the Soviet Union, that country's highest honor.
   At least 31 deaths are officially blamed on the April 26, 1986,
explosion and fire at the plant in the Ukraine, and scientists say
many more people may eventually be stricken with radiation-related
diseases.
   Despite lead shielding on the aircraft and other protective
gear, Grishchenko suffered radiation sickness and was found to have
pre-leukemia in September 1988. He was diagnosed with acute
myelocytic leukemia late last year.
   ``A lot of people are praying for him,'' said Cap Parlier of
Mesa, Ariz., an administrator for McDonnell Douglas Corp. Parlier
arranged for the transplant after hearing of Grishchenko's plight
from a Soviet colleague during the 1989 Paris Air Show.
   He arrived in Seattle April 11 for the marrow transplant, which
was performed April 27, after he underwent chemotherapy and
radiation treatment to kill off his own marrow.
   The pre-transplant therapy leaves patients with no natural
immunity against disease until the new marrow, which is
transplanted intravenously, takes hold, Ms. Edmonds said.
   Grishchenko had been in stable condition and doctors were
expecting a normal recovery when they decided Tuesday to operate to
remove a fungal infection in his right lung. Antibiotics had failed
to knock down the potentially life-threatening infection, which
Grishchenko developed before coming to Seattle, she said.
   The surgery was successful and Grishchenko appeared to be doing
fine until Thursday night, when he developed the high fever and
breathing problems.
   Doctors had waited until Grishchenko appeared strong enough to
tolerate the surgery, but the procedure may have ben too much for
his weakened system.

<DATELINE>MUENSTER, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The West German and Soviet foreign
ministers met today at the site where Germany's divisive Thirty
Years War ended, hoping to resolve issues involving Germany's
latest attempt at unity.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and his Soviet
counterpart, Eduard Shevardnadze, sat down at a table with advisers
in the old armament room of Muenster's town hall. Their talks, the
second in two weeks, were expected to last several hours.
   ``We want our accomplishments to be in the interests of the
German nation and contribute to building up of a new Europe, and we
are moving in that direction,'' Shevardnadze said during a
welcoming ceremony in the Peace Hall.
   The building is where Germany's rival Protestant and Roman
Catholic forces _ along with their respective European allies _
signed a treaty ending the 1618-48 war, fought mainly in Germany.
   Shevardnadze said previous talks on the international aspects of
German unity had gone well, and that he and Genscher would try to
find further common ground at the meeting, which was expected to
focus on the military stance of a united Germany.
   ``We have to ... find a common language on problems that haven't
been solved yet. These problems are complicated, but we're of good
will,'' he said through an interpreter.
   The meeting in Muenster comes one week after Genscher and
Shevardnadze met in the Soviet city of Brest near the border with
Poland.
   It is their second meeting on the international aspects of
German unification since President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev discussed the historic developments at their
Washington summit earlier this month.
   Genscher and Shevardnadze also have held previous discussions on
German unity.
   The Soviet Union and the Western allies have been locked in a
dispute over the military alignment of a unified Germany.
   West Germany, the United States and their allies have insisted
on NATO membership for the new German state, but the Soviet Union
has resisted.
   However, U.S. officials in Washington have said in the last few
weeks the Soviets appear to softening their opposition.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has been promoting a
nine-point program of assurances and incentives to help ease Soviet
concerns.
   Over the weekend, Genscher told a meeting of West and East
German members of his Free Democratic Party that unification could
only be reached with the Soviet Union support.
   The Free Democrats are part of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
governing coalition.
   Genscher said the Soviet Union must become part of Europe. He
said the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe
must produce political, military and cultural structures that will
bind the Soviet Union to a future Europe.

<HEAD>Court to Hear Appeal of Columbia, S.C., Officials and Ad Company</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to hear an
appeal by Columbia, S.C., officials and a billboard company jointly
found to have violated federal antitrust law.
   The court said it will review a ruling that the city and company
conspired to exclude a rival advertising firm from putting up new
billboards.
   The rival company, Omni Outdoor Advertising Inc., was awarded $3
million by a federal jury in 1986.
   The award was overturned by a trial judge but reinstated last
December by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The appeals court ordered Columbia Outdoor Advertising Inc. to
pay the sum, and barred city officials from enforcing an ordinance
the appeals court said was aimed at giving that company a virtual
billboard monopoly in the city.
   Omni's lawsuit said Columbia Outdoor Advertising established its
dominance in the city through the lifelong friendship of its
principal owner, J. Willis Cantey, with Mayor Kirkman Finlay. He no
longer is Columbia's mayor.
   The jury also heard evidence that Columbia Outdoor Advertising
gave Finlay and Columbia City Council members either free or
reduced-rate space on its billboards for their political ads.
   The council in 1982 adopted a moratorium on billboard
construction that blocked Omni from entering the market.
   After a state court declared the moratorium unconstitutional, it
was replaced the same year with an ordinance requiring billboards
be at least 1,000 feet apart. The new law had the effect of
preventing Omni from putting up signs.
   The 4th Circuit court said the Supreme Court has granted cities
a broad exemption from federal antitrust law when they enact
anti-competitive rules in accord with state policies.
   But the appeals court said the exemption does not permit the
type of behavior engaged in by Columbia officials.
   ``Sufficient evidence supports the jury's finding that there was
a conspiracy between the city and Columbia Outdoor Advertising,''
the appeals court said. The city was ``participating in the
conspiracy solely for the purposes of restraint of trade and
monopolization.''
   The appeals court said the city is immune from paying damages
because of a federal law that exempts local governments from such
awards.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the city and Columbia
Outdoor Advertising said the company engaged in ``wholly legitimate
and successful lobbying of city officials'' to restrict outdoor
advertising in the city.
   The case is City of Columbia vs. Omni Outdoor Advertising,
89-1671.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Agrees To Review Ruling on Texas Thrift</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
killing a lawsuit by a Texas businessman who says federal
regulators caused the financial ruin of his failed savings and loan
association.
   The court said it will review a ruling that revived part of
Thomas M. Gaubert's negligence suit against the government.
   The suit alleges the federal regulators who assumed day-to-day
operation of the Irving-based Independent American Savings
Association ran it out of business.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last Oct. 17 reinstated
that part of the suit in which Gaubert is seeking compensation for
$25 million worth of real estate he lost when the thrift went bust.
   The appeals court, however, did not let Gaubert pursue his bid
to collect from the government the $75 million lost value of his
Independent American shares.
   Gaubert, a prominent political fundraiser who persuaded former
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, to intervene with federal
regulators on his behalf, acquired a controlling interest in what
was to be known as Independent American in 1983.
   The rapidly expanding S&amp;L proposed in 1984 to merge with
Investex Savings, a failing Texas thrift, and purchase 22 branch
offices from United Savings Association.
   According to Gaubert's suit, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board
favored the merger but postponed approval. Government lawyers said
regulators were awaiting completion of an investigtion into
Gaubert's dealings with an Iowa thrift, Capitol Savings and Loan.
   Before approving the merger, the bank board persuaded Gaubert to
sign a ``neutralization agreement'' that effectively removed him
from Independent American affairs. Gaubert also personally
guaranteed Independent American's minimal net worth with real
estate worth over $25 million.
   In 1985, he agreed to remove himself permanently from
Independent American's management and not to serve as an officer or
director of any institution insured by the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corporation.
   Federal officials subsequently assisted Independent American in
its merger with Investex.
   ``Federal involvement came as a result of the inherent
persuasive power of the FHLBB, which no doubt rises from the
position of authority it occupies,'' the 5th Circuit court
recounted. ``The government euphemistically refers to this ability
to pressure S&amp;Ls as jawboning.''
   The thrift's board of directors was replaced under bank board
supervision, and in 1986 a former federal regulator was installed
as Independent American's chief operating officer.
   In May 1987, the Texas Savings and Loan Department closed
Independent American, and the bank board appointed the FSLIC as a
receiver.
   After an unsuccessful administrative claim, Gaubert sued under a
law that in some instances waives the federal government's
sovereign immunity.
   The law, the Federal Tort Claims Act, does not allow lawsuits
based on federal employees' discretionary duties _ and government
lawyers cited that exception in seeking to have Gaubert's suit
dismissed.
   A federal trial judge threw out the suit, but the 5th Circuit
court reinstated it.
   The appeals court said past Supreme Court rulings have
distinguished discretionary and day-to-day operational duties when
deciding whether lawsuits against the government should be allowed.
   Federal regulators ``were only protected by the (law's)
discretionary function exception until their actions became
operational in nature and thus crossed the line,'' the appeals
court said.
   The case is U.S. vs. Gaubert, 89-1793.

   The Supreme Court today refused to kill a
lawsuit in which a woman who claims to be Hank Williams Sr.'s
daughter seeks some of the late country music legend's copyright
royalties.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court
ruling that Cathy Yvonne Stone, 37, is entitled to have her legal
fight put before a jury.
   At the same time, the court rejected an appeal by country singer
Hank Williams Jr. that sought to reverse an Alabama Supreme Court
ruling that declared Ms. Stone a legal heir to the elder Williams.
   Named as defendants in Ms. Stone's royalties suit are Hank Jr.
and other copyright owners.
   Ms. Stone was born in Alabama five days after Williams died at
age 29 in 1953.
   Her mother, Bobbie Jett, and Williams had signed an agreement
months earlier in which he acknowledged he might be the father of
the then-unborn child.
   The girl first was adopted by Lillian Stone, Williams' mother.
After Mrs. Stone died, the child was adopted by George and Mary
Deupree. The Deuprees in 1967 refused to be included in court
proceedings to determine whether Williams had fathered any children
other than Hank Jr.
   Mrs. Deupree first told her adopted daughter in 1973 that the
elder Williams might have been her father. But Ms. Stone did not
take any immediate legal action to establish her real parentage.
   Soon after marrying attorney Keith Adkinson in 1985, Ms. Stone
filed federal and state court lawsuits seeking a share of Williams'
songwriting royalties.
   State courts in Alabama initially ruled that she was Williams'
daughter but not a legal heir.
   The federal lawsuit was dismissed by the New York-based 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in April 1989. Presuming that Williams was
Ms. Stone's father, the appeals court said she had waited too long
before suing.
   Ms. Stone then appealed to the nation's highest court, but the
justices rejected her appeal last November.
   Meanwhile, the Alabama Supreme Court last July reversed lower
state court rulings that had denied Ms. Stone status as an heir.
   The state Supreme Court ruled that some of the defendants _ but
not Hank Jr. _ had intentionally and fraudulently concealed Ms.
Stone's identity and legal rights.
   The 2nd Circuit court, citing the Alabama Supreme Court's
ruling, set aside its April 1989 ruling last Dec. 5.
   ``The evidence of fraud'' excuses Ms. Stone's delay in taking
legal action, the appeals court said.
   It added: ``The figure representing justice is blindfolded so
that the scales are held even, but justice is not blind to reality.
(Ms. Stone) therefore should have her day in court and an
opportunity to have a jury determine the merits of her claim.''
   In the royalties case appeal acted on today, lawyers for Hank
Williams Jr. and the other copyright owners argued, among other
things, that the Supreme Court's denial of review last November
should have ended the federal case.
   They said the appeals court was not authorized to grant a
rehearing after the high court turned down Ms. Stone's initial
appeal.
   Ms. Stone has begun her own country-singing career, using the
stage name Jett Williams.
   The cases are Williams vs. Stone, 89-1538 and 89-1563.

<HEAD>Court Leaves Intact Decision on Boston University Professor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact a decision
forcing Boston University to grant a lifetime professor's job to a
woman found to have been a victim of sex bias.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that requiring
the university to grant her tenure interferes with its academic
freedom.
   A key issue in the case of English literature professor Julia
Prewitt Brown was the admissibility of trial evidence allegedly
showing university president John Silber harbored sexist attitudes.
   Silber is on leave from the university to seek the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination in Massachusetts.
   The university argued that evidence of Silber's alleged sexism
should not have been presented to a federal jury that awarded Ms.
Brown $200,000.
   A judge added $15,000 to compensate Ms. Brown for emotional
distress, and ordered the university to reinstate her with lifetime
tenure.
   Ms. Brown currently is teaching at Providence University in
Rhode Island, where she has received tenure. She said she would
return to Boston University if the university lost its Supreme
Court appeal in the decade-long dispute.
   Ms. Brown had been teaching at BU for six years when she became
eligible for tenure in 1979.
   An English department committee voted, 22-0, that she receive
tenure, and its recommendation was supported, 9-2, by a university
committee.
   But Silber opposed tenure and recommended instead that Ms. Brown
remain on probation for three more years.
   Silber relied in part on a report by the university provost
questioning Ms. Brown's scholarly credentials.
   She had published a book of criticism on Jane Austen's novels
that generally was well reviewed by other scholars. But the provost
said the university should await further evidence of Ms. Brown's
abilities before awarding tenure.
   After Ms. Brown rejected the offer of three more years on
probation, the university board of trustees denied her tenure.
   When her lawsuit reached a trial, evidence was introduced of
Silber's alleged sexism.
   It included a remark he made describing the English department
as ``a damn matriarchy'' at a time when the department was headed
by a woman and included six female and 20 male faculty members.
   Silber also had told another woman on the faculty that she
should not be worried about job security since ``your husband is a
parachute,'' an apparent reference to the fact her husband was
employed.
   The jury also heard a portion of an old speech by Silber in
which he lamented the lack of parental supervision in families in
which both husbands and wives work outside the home.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in ruling last year for
Ms. Brown, refused to order a new trial in which the Silber remarks
would be excluded.
   The appeals court also rejected the university's arguments that
awarding Ms. Brown a lifetime job interfered with its academic
freedom.
   ``Academic freedom does not include the freedom to discriminate
against tenure candidates on the basis of sex or other
impermissible grounds,'' the appeals court said. ``Awarding (Ms.
Brown) tenure is the only way to provide her the most complete
relief possible.''
   The American Council on Education, representing some 1,500
colleges and universities, supported the university's appeal.
   The American Association of University Professors urged the high
court to reject the appeal.
   The case is Boston University vs. Brown, 89-1680.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Fine Against Maryland Man for Loud Preaching Against
Abortions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact the
conviction and $250 fine of a man cited for preaching too loudly
outside a Hagerstown, Md., abortion clinic.
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that
the state law used to prosecute Jerry Wayne Eanes violates
free-speech rights.
   Maryland's highest court rejected those arguments by a 4-3 vote
last February.
   The challenged state law makes it a crime to disturb the peace
in public places ``by making loud and unseemly noises.''
   Eanes was arrested outside the Hagerstown Reproductive Clinic on
May 18, 1988 while preaching on the city sidewalk outside the
clinic.
   The police officer who arrested Eanes had previously asked him
to lower his voice, and said Eanes continued to shout.
   There was testimony that Eanes could be heard over a block away.
   Although Eanes was arrested during business hours on a busy
downtown street, the neighborhood has several residential apartment
buildings. Police received complaints from residents about the
loudness of Eanes' voice, but not about his message.
   Eanes did not try to restrain anyone who entered or left the
abortion clinic. He did not try to block access to the clinic,
threaten anyone, trespass on private property or use profanity.
   A day before his arrest, Eanes had been acquitted in the
Washington County Circuit Court for allegedly making ``loud and
unseemly noises'' in front of the same abortion clinic on in July
1987. Eanes had not returned to the clinic until his acquittal.
   Judge Frederick C. Wright III found Eanes guilty of ``willfully
disturbing the peace and tranquility of that particular
neighborhood (on May 18) by making loud and otherwise unacceptable
... noises.''
   The judge said Eanes' loud preaching was ``improper under the
circumstances.''
   The Maryland Court of Appeals last February upheld the
misdemeanor conviction, ruling that the law was aimed at the manner
of Eanes' communication, not its content.
   ``Judge Wright properly balanced Eanes' First Amendment rights
against a substantial public interest protected by a narrowly
drawn, content-neutral regulation,'' the state court said.
   The three dissenting judges voted to overturn Eanes' conviction.
   ``Eanes was entitled to deliver an unamplified speech on the
topic of abortion from a public sidewalk in downtown Hagerstown
during the late morning,'' the dissenters said. ``To punish as
criminal the making of the speech, purportedly because it was too
loud, distorts both the statute and our basic constitutional
guarantees.''
   The case is Eanes vs. Maryland, 89-1745.

   A Soviet pilot landed a small plane on a
beach on the Black Sea coast today and requested political asylum,
a government official said.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass reported in Moscow that an
AN-2 plane was hijacked in Izmail, near the Ukrainian port of
Odessa.
   The Turkish official, who requested anonymity, said the pilot
was alone in the 12-seat Soviet passenger plane when it landed near
Kumcagiz village in Kocaeli province at 1:30 p.m.
   There are no airports in the province, and the plane landed on a
beach known as Kefken, the official said.
   The official said the Soviets immediately asked Turkey to return
the plane and the pilot.
   The semiofficial Anatolia news agency identified the pilot as
Valeri Yurevic, 29. He was reportedly taken to a police station for
questioning.
   Tass said the pilot had resigned several months ago from his job
with an Odessa air crew. It did not give further details.

hero will be greeted by New York City at its best _ and its worst.
   There will be a ticker-tape parade and traffic jams; diplomatic
meetings and media circuses; adoring crowds and hostile protesters;
speeches of sweeping scope and T-shirt proclamations.
   For the deputy leader of the African National Congress, released
in February after 27 years in South African jails, it will be his
first view of the United States.
   And for the city, disrupted at times by its own racial, ethnic,
political and economic animosities, it could be a rare moment of
self-appraisal.
   ``The fact that this is the first stop gives the average New
Yorker a great sense of pride,'' said Jean Owensby, a local
spokeswoman for Mandela's national tour. ``If there's a time to
come together, this is it.''
   In a city so big, togetherness is a relative thing. A Bronx
rabbi, Avi Weiss, announced he will hold a prayer vigil to protest
Mandela's friendly relations with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   But planning for the visit has mainly drawn cooperation. There
are the small details, such as the Trans Lux Corp.'s donation of
100 miles of ticker tape. And there are the major ones, such as
producer Bill Graham's volunteer work organizing a concert and
rally for 60,000 people at Yankee Stadium.
   Like Mandela, ``I came out of a suppressed society,'' said
Graham, a Jew born in Berlin. ``There is something about freedom of
expression that's always meant a great deal to me, and a great deal
to all of us.''
   Mandela also will raise money at star-studded fund-raisers _
including one with Robert De Niro as host _ and lobby for his cause
at a session with business leaders. He will address the U.N.
General Assembly and submit to interviews, including an hour and a
half with ABC's Ted Koppel.
   The proceedings will be similar in the other cities on Mandela's
10-day tour, which is part of a 14-nation, six-week tour of the
world.
   Gatherings are scheduled at Tiger Stadium in Detroit, the Los
Angeles Coliseum and the Oakland Coliseum. Bostonians are planning
a luncheon at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and a public
reception at Boston Common.
   In Miami, he is to address the convention of the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. In Atlanta, he
is expected to stop at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center and will
receive an honorary degree from a group of black colleges.
   The political peak will be in Washington, where he meets with
President Bush and addresses a joint session of Congress.
   The highlights in New York include a motorcade Wednesday morning
through Brooklyn and then the parade up lower Broadway in Manhattan
to City Hall, where Mayor David Dinkins will give Mandela the key
to the city.
   Mandela will spend Wednesday, Thursday and Friday nights at
Gracie Mansion, the mayor's residence.
   ``I would be delighted to be just standing in the throng, just
one of those persons in the audience, listening to him, looking at
him,'' Dinkins said. ``And so to be in a position to welcome him in
an official capacity as mayor of the city and to have him stay at
Gracie Mansion is beyond my fondest dreams. I just never envisioned
anything as wonderful and as great as this.''
   Another major gathering is Thursday evening in Harlem, where
Mandela will address what organizers say will be as many as 100,000
people.
   Then, Thursday night at Yankee Stadium, 60,000 are expected at
an ANC fund-raiser, with tickets selling for $5 to $25.
   Billy Joel, who plays the stadium the next two nights, is
lending the rally his production equipment. Graham and tour
planners have declined to identify which bands will perform, saying
they want the focus to remain on Mandela and his cause.
   That will not be difficult for people like Owensby, who were too
young to have joined the civil rights marches of the 1960s.
   ``This is like me witnessing history for the first time in my
life,'' she said. ``I'm about to bust.''

   India and Pakistan agreed today to hold
talks to try to ease the threat of war over the disputed northern
region of Kashmir.
   An Indian government spokesman said top officials of the nations
will meet early next month but that the date and location had not
been decided. The Foreign Ministry spokesman could not be
indentified under briefing rules.
   In Islamabad, Pakistan's foreign secretary, Tanvir Ahmed Khan,
confirmed the proposed meeting. ``I think this is a welcome
development,'' he said. ``This could be a good beginning.''
   A dispute over the Kashmir Valley has brought the neighbors
close to their fourth war since they gained independence from
Britain in 1947.
   India and Pakistan both claim Kashmir, a predominately Moslem
state that joined mainly Hindu India when Britain partitioned the
subcontinent along religious lines.
   The territory is divided between the nations by a cease-fire
line, and the armies of both countries have massed troops and
artillery along the border.
   Talk of war has disturbed many countries because both nations
are believed to possess nuclear weapons technology. India exploded
an atomic device in 1974. Two of the three previous India-Pakistan
wars, fought in 1948 and 1965, have been over Kashmir. Both were
won by India.
   India accuses Pakistan of arming and training Moslem Kashmiri
militants who are fighting for independence from India.
   Pakistan denies the charges. However, Islamabad has often said
it supports the Kashmiri secession, calling it a movement for
self-determination.
   India launched a crackdown on the separatist movement on Jan.
20. Since then, more than 550 people have died in the valley,
mostly independence activists or their supporters.
   In May, a deputy U.S. national security adviser, Robert Gates,
traveled to Pakistan and India to urge them to open talks. Western
diplomats in New Delhi today credited the Gates' visit and Soviet
pressure with helping to defuse the situation slightly.
   ``The Americans read the Pakistanis the riot act and the Soviets
have done the same to the Indians,'' said a Middle Eastern military
official. ``Now we have some hope.''
   The Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman said the decision today
was taken after a meeting between Indian Foreign Secretary Muchkund
Dubey and Pakistan's ambassador, Bashir Khan Babar.

   A jury was seated today in the cocaine and
perjury trial of Mayor Marion Barry and was immediately placed in
the care of U.S. marshals for the duration of the case.
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson scheduled
opening statements in the case for Tuesday morning and said the
jurors will be sworn in at that time. The judge told them they
would collect their belongings and be sequestered.
   The panel of 12 people plus six alternates includes 13 blacks
and five whites. There are just three men among the 18 people.
Barry, 54, is black, and a number of prospective jurors questioned
in the past two weeks said they thought race and politics played a
role in the investigation and prosecution of the three-term mayor.
   During the trial, the group of 18 won't be told which are jurors
and which are being held as alternates.
   U.S. marshals will transport them between the U.S. Courthouse
and an area hotel, where they will be housed until the trial is
over.
   Barry is charged with 10 counts of cocaine possession, one count
of conspiracy and three felony counts of lying to a federal grand
jury about his alleged involvement with drugs.
   Many of the prospective jurors questioned for Barry's trial
expressed strong opinions about the case and the FBI sting
operation that led to the Washington mayor's arrest.
   The 18 were drawn from a group of 81 people approved during two
weeks of questioning.
   Barry announced last week that he would not seek re-election to
a fourth term as mayor of the District of Columbia.
   Plea bargaining discussions haven't produced any agreement that
would avert a trial. Sources familiar with the case say U.S.
Attorney Jay Stephens is insisting Barry plead guilty to a felony,
which would almost certainly mean at least a short jail term.
   On Friday, defense lawyer R. Kenneth Mundy said there was
``nothing going on'' except preparations for a trial.
   The jury that will sit in judgment of the mayor was drawn from a
group that includes:
   _An art teacher at a private school who said she would have
difficulty presuming Barry's innocence.
   _A retired Census Bureau worker who said the FBI sting operation
aimed at Barry was an invasion of the mayor's privacy.
   _A man who said he thought it was unfair for the FBI to bring
ex-model Rasheeda Moore all the way from Los Angeles to help them
catch Barry smoking crack cocaine in a hotel room. ``The videotape
should not have been done,'' the man said of the undercover
operation.
   Despite these responses and similar answers by numerous other
potential jurors, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson made
them eligible to serve on the jury.
   All said they would be fair and impartial if they sat as jurors,
even though they had strong opinions about aspects of the case and
some voiced concern that the fact that Barry is black and a
Democrat could have figured in the investigation.
   The judge disqualified more than 60 other people whose answers
suggested they couldn't set aside their personal views and focus
only on the evidence presented in the courtroom.
   But some of those who remain expressed doubts about their
ability to be totally impartial.
   Mundy asked the art teacher if it was difficult to overcome a
presumption of guilt.
   ``It is,'' she conceded. ``But I don't think it would be
impossible.''

   The Supreme Court today spared the federal
program protecting the pensions of 30 million American workers from
a potential financial crisis.
   By an 8-1 vote, the court broadened the authority of the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation to order employers to restore
terminated pension plans.
   A federal appeals court limited such authority last year by
setting aside the agency's order that LTV Corp. and its subsidiary,
LTV Steel Co., restore three pension plans with unfunded
liabilities of $2.3 billion. Today's decision reversed the appeals
court ruling.
   Government lawyers told the justices the appeals court ruling,
if not overturned, ``could lead to a financial crisis similar to
that currently facing'' the government insurance program for the
savings and loan industry.
   At issue was the agency's power to shift liability for pension
payments back to an employer in what is called an ``anti-follow-on
policy.''
   Writing for the court, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said the policy
``is not contrary to clear congressional intent and is based on a
permissible construction'' of federal law.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Buttressed the power of police to videotape and record and
responses of suspected drunken drivers.
   By an 8-1 vote, the justices ruled that police did not violate a
Pennsylvania man's rights when _ without warning him of his rights
_ they recorded his answers to questions about his height, weight
and color of his eyes.
   _ Ruled that a federal law reducing patent infringement
protection for drug companies applies to medical devices.
   The court, by a 6-2 vote, refused to reinstate a $26.7 million
award against Medtronic Inc. of Minneapolis. Eli Lilly and Co. of
Indianapolis said Medtronic infringed patents on a device implanted
in patients to correct potentially fatal heart rhythms.
   _ Agreed to consider killing a lawsuit by a Texas businessman
who says federal regulators caused the financial ruin of his failed
savings and loan association.
   The court said it will review a ruling that revived part of
Thomas M. Gaubert's negligence suit against the government. The
suit alleges the federal regulators who assumed day-to-day
operation of the Irving-based Independent American Savings
Association ran it right out of business.
   _ Refused to kill a lawsuit in which a woman who claims to be
Hank Willilams Sr.'s daughter seeks some of the late country music
legend's copyright royalties.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court
ruling that Cathy Yvonne Stone, 37, is entitled to have her legal
fight put before a jury.
   _ Left intact the conviction and $250 fine of a man cited for
preaching too loudly outside a Hagerstown, Md., abortion clinic.
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that
the state law used to prosecute Jerry Wayne Eanes violates
free-speech rights.
   _ Rejected a challenge to California's day-care licensing system
by a religiously affiliated pre-school center.
   The court, without comment, left intact rulings that the
center's religious freedom was not violated by state licensing
rules that include a ban on corporal punishment for children
attending day-care centers.
   The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, modeled after the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp., is wholly owned by the federal government. Its
board of directors is comprised of the secretaries of labor,
treasury and commerce.
   The agency protects the pension benefits of the 30 million
workers who participate in single-employer pension plans.
   When a pension plan is ended with insufficient money to satisfy
promised benefits, the agency becomes the pension plan's trustee,
taking over its assets and liabilities. The agency then pays _ with
taxpayer money _ benefits workers had earned as of the date the
pension plan ended.
   The PBGC in fiscal year 1988 paid $324.7 million in insured
benefits to 113,000 retirees who participated in 1,476 terminated
pension plans.
   The cost of the pension insurance is paid primarily by employers
with active pension plans and by employers who terminate
underfunded pension plans.
   But the PBGC has money problems of its own _ a $1 billion
deficit. It currently lists assets of about $3.2 billion and
liabilities of about $4.2 bilion.
   The PBGC's executive director, James B. Lockhart, told a
congressional subcommittee last week the agency soon could be
unable to meet its obligations.
   Lockhart told the subcommittee, ``The overall pension system is
extremely healthy. We're not an S&amp;L crisis. I don't think we'd have
to go to the taxpayer for a bailout.''
   But lawyers representing the PBGC previously had raised the S&amp;L
crisis analogy in briefs submitted to the Supreme Court.
   The Dallas-based LTV and its Cleveland-based LTV Steel
subsidiary, after filing for reorganization under federal
bankruptcy law in 1986, advised the PBGC that they could not fund
the three pension plans they sponsored. The plans were ended in
1987.
   In a deal with the United Steelworkers union, however, LTV Steel
agreed to what government lawyers contended is a ``follow-on''
arrangement. Under it, LTV agreed to make up any benefits lost to
retirees because of the pension plan's termination _ those benefits
not covered by the federal pension insurance program.
   The result: retirees continued to receive the same benefits they
did before the plans were terminated, and payment of underfunded
pension liabilities was shifted to the PBGC.
   LTV was responsible for $75 million in annual supplemental
retirement benefits, and the federal agency was picking up the tab
for some $400 million in annual obligations to LTV pensioners.
   The PBGC contended such arrangements are abusive, and the agency
ordered LTV to re-assume responsibility for the three pension
plans. When LTV refused, the agency sought to enforce its order in
federal court.
   A federal judge threw out the PBGC's order for restoration, and
the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling. Both
lower courts ruled that Congress never intended to give the agency
the power to order restoration based on the creation of such
``follow-on'' benefit plans.
   In seeking the Supreme Court's help, lawyers for the PBGC said
``other companies will follow LTV's example and use pension
insurance as a subsidy to reduce costs and gain a competitive
edge.''
   The PBGC estimates that the underfunding of pension plans it
insures could run as high as $30 billion.
   Today, the high court ruled for the PBGC.
   Only Justice John Paul Stevens dissented.
   The court's ruling comes against a backdrop of serious problems
in the administration of private pension programs.
   An Associated Press investigation last year found that one in
four of the private pension plans audited by the government is
violating the law. Fraud and mismanagement could wipe out the
retirement nest eggs of millions of workers and saddle taxpayers
with a multibillion-dollar bailout, experts told the AP.
   Nationwide, some 870,000 private pension plans hold assets of
about $2 trillion dollars.
   Most claims for PBGC money have come from the steel industry,
but Lockhart cautioned that his agency's $1 billion deficit could
double if the PBGC has to bail out the financially ailing airlines
industry.
   ``If they go bust, the taxpayer picks up the bill _ just like
the S&amp;Ls,'' said Joe McGowan of the Labor Department's inspector
general's office.
   The case is PBGC vs. LTV, 89-390.

   Police today arrested a man wearing
handcuffs and said he was a suspected Irish Republican Army member
who had escaped from Belgian authorities.
   Police in Belgium had apprehended three people Saturday and
seized a car containing two handguns, an automatic rifle,
ammunition and explosives.
   But two of those arrested and handcuffed managed to escape the
authorities and flee to the Netherlands. Police said they arrested
one of the suspects several hours later near the Dutch town of
Ulvenhout.
   The second escapee was arrested today after a tip by residents,
national police spokesman Stephan Worm said. Worm sad the suspect
was still wearing handcuffs.
   A police bulletin broadcast by Dutch Television identified one
of the two detainees as 27-year-old Gerard Majella Harte. The other
suspect, about 30 years old, was identified only by his alias,
Andrew Edward Thornton.
   Belgian police said the third suspect was a woman, and they
identified her as Donna Maguire of Newry, Northern Ireland.
   Ms. Maguire, 23, was charged on Sunday with possessing a false
U.S. passport, using a false name and criminal association.
   She is wanted in West Germany on IRA-related terrorist charges.
   Ms. Maguire was acquitted in February in Ireland of possessing
explosives and switches used to detonate bombs.
   A companion, Leonard Hardy of Belfast, Northern Ireland, was
convicted and sentenced to five years in prison. The court ruled
there was no evidence Ms. Maguire knew what Hardy was carrying.
   Irish police said the two, arrested July 12 after stepping off a
ferry from France to Rosslare, Ireland, carried several false
passports and that Hardy had photographs of British army bases in
Germany.
   West German authorities are seeking the arrest of Ms. Maguire,
Hardy and three others for IRA attacks in Osnabrueck and Hanover
that killed one British serviceman.
   Harte, of Lurgan, Northern Ireland, served a four-year sentence
in Ireland for IRA-related offenses and was released in 1985.
   The British, meanwhile, had sought his extradition to Northern
Ireland. Harte appealed to Ireland's supreme court and was granted
bail pending a ruling.
   He was later convicted in Craigavon, Northern Ireland, of petrol
bomb and arson charges stemming from incidents in 1979, and was
sentenced to a year in prison.
   The overwhelmingly Roman Catholic IRA seeks to end British rule
of Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite it with the
southern Irish Republic.
   It has conducted dozens of attacks against British military
targets in West Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.
   Last month, the IRA fatally shot two Australian tourists in the
Netherlands because it mistook them for British soldiers.

<HEAD>Court Rules Patent-Infringement Law Applies to Medical Devices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled today that a federal
law reducing patent-infringement protection for drug companies
applies to medical devices.
   The court, by a 6-2 vote, refused to reinstate a $26.7 million
award against Medtronic Inc. of Minneapolis.
   Eli Lilly and Co. of Indianapolis said Medtronic infringed
patents on a device implanted in patients to correct potentially
fatal heart rhythms.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, upheld
Medtronic's interpretation of a 1984 patent-infringement law. The
statute applies to patented inventions as well as generic drugs, he
said.
   Scalia said Medtronic did not infringe on Eli Lilly's patent as
long as the activities of the former firm were reasonably related
to the development of information necessary to obtain federal
approval for its device. The case now goes back to a lower federal
court to determine whether Medtronic met that condition.
   The 1984 law is intended to help generic drug manufacturers
seeking to place their substitutes for patented drugs on the market
as soon as patents expire.
   The law permits the generic drug firms to get information from
the federal Food and Drug Administration and apply to the FDA for
approval of their substitutes prior to expiration of the patented
drugs.
   Also, as long as the purpose is related to its application to
the FDA, the generic companies are allowed by law to ``make, use or
sell a patented invention'' prior to the patent's expiration.
   Eli Lilly, with support from other major medical companies and
patent holders, said applying the law to medical devices could
undermine health care research and development of life-saving
inventions.
   It said the pace of costly, innovative research will be slowed
because patent holders will fear their work soon would be copied.
   But Medtronic said Eli Lilly is distorting economic reality.
   Medtronic said the value of the heart-implant devices it tested
is less than $415,000. By contrast, it said, Eli Lilly is expected
to sell more than $100 million worth of the devices before a
two-year extension of its patent expires on Oct. 26, 1990.
   Medtronic said its new device is intended to treat cardiac
distrubances painlessly with low-energy electrical impulses as a
substitute for the higher-energy shocks that accompany the Lilly
device.
   Lilly's appeal to the Supreme Court was supported by Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, sponsor of the 1984 legislation, and Rep. Carlos
Moorhead, R-Pa., floor manager of the bill in the House.
   The case is Eli Lilly vs. Medtronic Inc, 89-243.

   A cloud of fumes spewing from a chemical
plant forced about 1,500 people from their homes for several hours
today, authorities said. Fifteen people were taken to hospitals.
   The injured were treated for burning eyes and throats, skin
irritation and nausea after fumes vented a tank at the Alcolac Inc.
plant around midnight. All were released, city administrator Irl
Tessendorf said.
   Plant manager Richard Faulkner identified the chemical as allyl
methracylate. Tessendorf said the fumes, which dissipated before
dawn, would cause serious health problems only in strong doses.
   The evacuation order was canceled about 8 a.m., Tessendorf said.
   Pressure from a chemical reaction caused a tank to vent the
fumes into the air, where it formed a cloud and began drifting
southeast, said Fire Chief Mike Ditzfeld.
   A retirement home and other residences on the east side of
Sedalia and several other small communities were evacuated. Medical
teams were called out to treat residents who may have suffered skin
irritations or other problems from the fumes.
   There was no fire at the plant, which manufactures soap and
other cleaning materials.
   Faulkner said the accident was caused by either a mechanical or
employee failure. The state Department of Natural Resources and the
Department of Health were investigating the accident, he said.
   Sedalia is about 85 miles southeast of Kansas City and has a
population of about 21,000.

   The death toll from last week's flash
floods mounted to 21 today when a body was found in the Ohio River,
and authorities said there was little hope for the 14 people still
listed as missing.
   ``It's just been too long. I don't think there's anybody alive
out there. You can't swim out there that long in the Ohio River,''
said Chuck Vogt, Belmont County coroner's investigator.
   The search for the missing was suspended briefly this morning
when a thunderstorm rolled through the area. Heavy rain fell for
about 45 minutes, swelling Wegee Creek, one of two creeks that
overflowed in Thursday night's flash flood.
   By midmorning, the muddy creek was nearly crossing a road about
three miles upstream from where the floods inflicted the most
damage. Lt. Dean Irvin of the Ohio Army National Guard said there
were no immediate reports of additional property damage.
   The body found this morning was in the Ohio River near
Moundsville, W.Va., about 10 miles south of Shadyside, according to
Chuck Vogt, Belmont County coroner's investigator.
   The number of names on the list of missing dropped from 18 to 14
with the identities of three victims and a call by one person
alerting authorities that she was safe, Vogt said. One of the
recovered bodies remains unidentified. Authorities are not ruling
out the possibility that other people not on the list could be
missing.
   Four bodies were recovered Sunday.
   Officials said Friday that 60 people were missing; some of those
later were found dead, while others notified authorities that they
were safe and officials learned that still more had moved out of
the area.
   Wegee and Pipe creeks overflowed during storms that dumped 5{
inches of rain in 3{ hours. The floods destroyed as many as 70
houses and damaged up to 40 others.
   Most of those whose homes and belongings were swept away by the
wall of water will have to put their lives back together largely
without benefit of insurance.
   Few people in the coal-mining and steel-making area carried
flood insurance, and homeowners' insurance will not cover damage
from Thursday's flood, residents and insurers said.
   ``We didn't think we needed to have flood insurance. For what?
That creek never flooded. Then this. Everybody just got wiped
out,'' said Julia Kulazenka.
   Rainwater running down hillsides had forced debris into the
creeks and formed dams at bridges spanning them, Shadyside Fire
Chief Mark Badia said.
   ``Eventually the bridges couldn't hold any more. The debris
broke loose, and that's when we got three big gushes of water,''
Badia said.
   The home Mrs. Kulazenka shared with her husband until his death
last July was damaged as Wegee Creek raged out of control. She said
replacing a machine shop, garage, deck and automobiles she and her
son owned would cost more than $80,000.
   ``They told us homeowners' won't do us no good. So unless the
government helps us rebuild, I don't know what I'll do with this
place,'' Mrs. Kulazenka said.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it will open an
office Tuesday in Shadyside to accept applications from residents
for low-interest loans and grants to help them rebuild.
   Before the flood, land in the Wegee Creek valley fetched
handsome prices, said Kulazenka's son, Charles Kulazenka. That was
especially welcome to residents, many of whom were either retired
or laid off from jobs in coal mines in Belmont County, where
unemployment in April was 6.8 percent.
   ``Ground was at a premium down here before this because it was
just outside the city limits (of Shadyside). It was quiet and
peaceful and people were looking to buy and build new homes out
here. Now, you couldn't give it away,'' Kulazenka said.
   ``But we can't be bitter, though, because we've got our lives,
and a lot of our neighbors, real close buddies, weren't that
lucky.''

   An environmental group called on consumers
today to boycott products containing a chemical used in such items
as hornet sprays and art supplies, which it said is harming Earth's
ozone layer.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council also accused the Bush
administration of ``waffling'' in its position on an international
agreement designed to curb production of the chemical,
1,1,1-trichloroethane,
   The NRDC said approximately 724 million pounds of the chemical,
known as 1,1,1 for short, were produced in the United States in
1988.
   David Doniger, an attorney with the group, said 90 percent of
the substance is used in industry, where it is an ingredient of
solvents used to clean electronic and metal parts.
   Among consumer goods which contain the chemical, the NRDC said,
are some of the varnishes and fixatives marketed by M. Grumbacher
Inc., the art supply firm.
   Godfrey Chambers, technical services manager for Grumbacher,
said by telephone from the firm's headquarters in Cranbury, N.J.,
that the company has eliminated 1,1,1 from some of its products and
is hoping to get it eliminated from the ones listed.
   Chambers said the products _ Damar varnish, Myston, Retouch
varnish and Tuffilm fixative _ are manufactured by a supplier and
purchased by Grumbacher for resale.
   ``The person we purchase it from is continuing research in this
matter to try and eliminate it,'' he said.
   ``Formerly, more of our aerosols did contain it, but through the
process of research, we have been able to eliminate it,'' he said.
   ``It is a concern of the industry at large,'' Chambers said.
   Doniger said substitutes are available for 1,1,1 in most of its
industrial and consumer uses.
   ``We recommend that consumers avoid buying products which
contain 1,1,1-trichloroethane, or any other substance which
contributes to the destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer,''
the council said. ``For most applications, there are alternative
products on the market that serve the same purpose.''
   The NRDC listed 141 products, but said there are more. The ones
listed included hair sprays, spot removers, solvents and cleaners,
furniture polish, water repellents, insecticides, automotive
products and other office and household items.
   Doniger said he will be pressing for phasing out of 1,1,1 when
representatives of more than 70 nations gather in London Wednesday
under sponsorship of the United Nations Environmental Program to
consider revisions to an international agreement on the ozone layer.
   ``The U.S. delegation is still waffling somewhere between a 25
percent rollback and a 100 percent phaseout by 2000,'' he said.
   ``Indications are that the European Community and Japan, and now
the United States, are balking at going farther than 50 percent,''
he added.
   Some environmentalists say manmade chemicals are eating away the
Earth's protective ozone shield, allowing more ultraviolet rays to
reach the planet's surface. They contend this increases the risk of
skin cancer, cataract formation and disruption of the environment.

<TEXT>
   The heirs of the Communist Party have won
control of Parliament in Bulgaria's first free elections in 58
years, but unofficial results today showed the capital firmly in
opposition hands.
   Bulgaria's ruling Socialists are the only reform Communists to
hold onto power in an Eastern Europe where authoritarian rule gave
way to popular elections this year after decades of Soviet
domination.
   Premier Andrei Lukanov today said he was confident he could form
a government with broad support. He said he was encouraged by the
main opposition coalition's support for a government of
non-partisan administrators.
   Members of Bulgaria's Communist Party formed the Socialist Party
and state-run Sofia radio said unofficial final results showed the
Socialists won 39 of the 81 seats at stake in Sunday's run-offs.
That would give them them a total of 211 seats in the 400-member
Parliament.
   The main opposition alliance, the Union of Democratic Forces,
won 37 seats for a total of 144, the radio said. Among those were
six more seats in Sofia to give the alliance 24 of the capital's 26
seats, unofficial counts showed.
   The opposition in this country of 9 million gets much of its
backing from the urban intelligensia, while the Socialists are seen
as a force for stability in the Balkan country's more conservative
countryside.
   The Agrarian Party, a once docile ally of the Communists, won 16
seats in the June 10 first round and had no candidates in the
runoff. Other smaller opposition groups and independents won a
total of six seats.
   Official results were expected Tuesday.
   Non-Communists have triumphed in nationwide elections in East
Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania, although the party
that swept last month's balloting in Romania has many former
Communists in its leadership.
   The Communists have been a strong political force in Bulgaria
for nearly a century and as the Socialist Party, the name they took
in April, have essentially maintained political control of small
towns and villages.
   Opposition leaders have accused the Socialists of using
intimidation and fraud to secure votes.
   Foreign observers say they have not noted significant
irregularities and Sunday's voting appeared to proceed smoothly at
most polling sites. However, state television reported some
irregularities, including illegal canvassing.
   Dimiter Ivanov, an activist from the Association for Fair
Elections, said that in some cases, the number of people voting
exceeded the number of people registered in the respective
precincts.
   Outside a polling station in the town of Stanke Dimitrov, about
40 miles south of Sofia, a young soldier who refused to give his
name said he voted for the Socialists ``because I want security, I
am scared of the UDF.''
   The opposition was only nascent when reform Communists ousted
longtime Communist strongman Todor Zhivkov in November and had
wanted the elections postponed until the fall to give it more time
to organize.
   Shortly before the polls closed, state television said 75
percent of the eligible voters had cast ballots. In the first first
round, 91 percent voted.
   The Socialists have proposed a coalition government of national
unity, but the Union of Democratic Forces has resisted.
   The Socialist leader, Alexander Lilov, said in an interview
published Sunday in the party daily Duma that if the opposition
refuses to join a coalition his party will approach ``respected
personalities'' to form a government of ``experts and
professionals.''
   Petar Beron, a Union of Democratic Forces leader, said today
that his 16-party coalition would favor such a government if it
were temporary: ``Such a government is usually a caretaker
government, but it cannot rule the country for very long.''
   The chief task of the new government will be tackling the
country's $10 billion foreign debt, rising inflation and consumer
goods shortages while gearing the economy toward capitalism.
   The Union of Democratic Forces favors sweeping private ownership
and privatization of agriculture.
   The Socialists would prefer to leave some industry
government-run for the time being and are vague on the future
status of farming, which is currently government-owned or
cooperative.

<HEAD>Experiment Linking Welfare to School Attendance Praised,
Criticized</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Wisconsin experiment aimed at keeping
welfare children in school was praised Monday as a long-term
investment in youth and, at the same time, criticized as cruel and
ineffective.
   The federal government is interested enough in the ``Learnfare''
concept, which cuts off welfare payments to families whose
teen-agers miss class, to authorize an expansion. Supporters
acknowledged it is too early to judge whether the program, begun in
1987, has worked.
   Patricia A. Goodrich, secretary of the Wisconsin Department of
Health and Social Services, told a Senate Finance subcommittee
hearing that Learnfare provides ``the unique opportunity to have a
direct and positive influence on the futures of our children and,
through them, the future of our state and nation.''
   Learnfare covers 27,000 Wisconsin teen-agers whose parents
receive Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and ``92 percent
of those students are meeting the program's attendance
requirements,'' Ms. Goodrich said.
   If a teen-ager whose parents receive welfare has more than two
unexcused absences in a month, the family's welfare payment is cut
by the amount normally included for the teen-ager's needs.
   Carol Croce, executive director of the Wisconsin Nutrition
Project, said Learnfare exacerbates family situations already
strained by poverty and the pressures of single parenting.
   ``Grants reduced by Learnfare sanctions have resulted in
evictions and utility shutoffs and have forced some families into
emergency shelters,'' Ms. Croce told the subcommittee. ``It has had
a perverse and destructive effect on family structure by giving
teens unwarranted control over the family's income.''
   Even with the program, she added, ``We still don't know why
these teens are absent from school.''
   Backers of the program say that requiring teen-agers to stay in
school will help break the cycle of poverty and prepare them for
better jobs.
   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recently
approved Wisconsin's proposal to expand the program to cover
younger children. However, families of these children will not face
a reduction in their welfare payments so long as parents cooperate
with Learnfare case workers.

<TEXT>
   Nine of the 23 U.S. soldiers killed in the
invasion of Panama were accidentally slain by their comrades, and
most of the Americans wounded were probably hit by friendly fire as
well, Newsweek says.
   The apparent reason is that Americans did most of the shooting,
the magazine reported in its June 25 issue, which goes on sale
today.
   As many as 60 percent of the 347 U.S. soldiers wounded in the
Dec. 20 attack were probably hit by fire from their comrades, and
nine were killed by other American servicemen, Newsweek said,
citing unidentified military sources.
   ``We just don't have any comment on that at this time,'' said
Pentagon spokesman Ken Satterfield.
   The magazine also said it had learned the surprise attack was
compromised by up to 15 different security leaks.
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega knew at 10 p.m. the night before the
invasion that there was a chance the United States would attack,
Newsweek said.
   However, Noriega dismissed the reports, Newsweek said.
   The leaks came from girlfriends of U.S. soldiers in Panama,
Panamanian customs agents who warned of arriving cargo planes and a
Panamanian telephone operator at Fort Clayton who monitored calls
about the invasion, the magazine said.
   Newsweek also said it had learned that, contrary to the Bush
administration's insistence that the invasion was a last-minute
response to provocation after a U.S. soldier was shot, plans for
the invasion were approved by President Bush in November.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
declined today to respond to the report and said, ``We continue to
believe that the Panama invasion was very effectively, efficiently
carried out'' given the ``complexity of the operation.''

   An Army private who was demoted and thrown out
of the service after his rifle was stolen will receive an honorable
discharge and back pay, the service said today.
   The action involves Pfc. James Griffin III of Fort Lauderdale,
Fla., whose case was the subject of a ``60 Minutes'' television
report last month.
   Griffin was serving with Task Force Arriba in San Lorenzo,
Honduras, in March 1989 when he was charged with loss of his rifle.
The enlisted man contended that the rifle had been stolen but his
U.S. superiors turned him over to Honduran authorities for
interrogation.
   He was released 18 hours later after undergoing brutal
questioning and was eventually returned to Fort Bragg, N.C., where
five months later he was thrown out of the Army.
   The Army decision to reverse its earlier action was taken by the
Army Board for the Correction of Military Records, according to
Army spokesman Maj. Joe Allred. It calls for giving Griffin an
honorable discharge, dated June 8, 1990, restoration to the rank of
private first class and E-3 pay grade, and lifting a ban on his
reenlistment.
   Allred said Griffin will receive full back pay and allowances
for the period covering his initial discharge date of Sept. 19,
1989, to June 8, 1990, but that the exact amount has not yet been
determined.
   The Army action came after the Pentagon's inspector general
recommended that Griffin receive the honorable discharge.
   The inspector general said Griffin had been the victim of a ruse
devised to obtain information about the lost weapon. Four Army
officers stationed in Honduras with Griffin were involved in the
affair. Three were given letters of reprimand while a fourth
received verbal counseling.

   Barring a last-minute reprieve, John
Edward Swindler tonight will become the first person executed in
Arkansas since 1964.
   Swindler, 46, is scheduled to die in the electric chair at the
state prison near Grady for the 1976 slaying of a policeman during
a shootout while on the run from a double murder he committed in
Columbia, S.C.
   Arkansas would become the 14th state to carry out an execution
and Swindler the 130th inmate put to death since the U.S. Supreme
Court in 1976 let states resume use of capital punishment.
   Arkansas plans another execution on June 25. Ronald Gene Simmons
is to die by injection for the 1987 killings of 16 people,
including 14 family members.
   Because Swindler was sentenced before Arkansas changed its
method of execution from electrocution to injection, he was given a
choice of either method. He left the choice up to prison officials,
who selected the method originally specified in his sentence,
electrocution.
   The U.S. Supreme Court denied a stay on Saturday. Only the
intervention of Gov. Bill Clinton _ who last week denied clemency _
or a last-ditch appeal from Swindler's lawyers or another group
could stop the 9 p.m. execution, Attorney General Steve Clark said.
None of those scenarios appeared likely, Clark said.
   One of Swindler's attorneys, Gerald Coleman, said there would be
no 11th-hour appeal from them. ``I'm not planning on doing
anything. I know of no other plans of anybody else to file
anything,'' Coleman said in a telephone interview today.
   ``We reviewed the case and took our best shot. There's nothing
else that could be done that wouldn't be just a frivolous filing,''
he said. ``You could file most anything, making some allegation in
just trying to delay it.
   Swindler was sentenced to die for the murder of Fort Smith
police officer Randy Basnett, who was killed at a gas station after
recognizing Swindler.
   At the time, Swindler was wanted for killing two people in South
Carolina three days after his release from the federal prison at
Leavenworth, Kan. Swindler, who was driving a stolen car, told
authorities he was headed back to Kansas to kill as many people as
he could for his treatment there.
   While awaiting execution in Arkansas, he was convicted of two
murders in South Carolina and sentenced to four life terms.
   The last person executed in Arkansas was Charles Franklin
Fields, who was electrocuted in 1964 for rape.
   About 50 members of the human rights group Amnesty International
held a 26-minute vigil Sunday night commemorating 26 years without
an execution in the state.
   Amnesty International member Cynthia Crawford read a statement
imploring Clinton ``not to end the decency of the past 26 years by
reinstituting this brutish form of violence.''
   ``The members of Amnesty International in Arkansas are repulsed
at this reactivation of this state's machinery of death,'' Crawford
said. ``Just as Amnesty International opposes any use of torture,
we also oppose executions, the ultimate form of torture.''
   The group urged Clinton to grant clemency to Swindler and
Simmons. Crawford urged citizens who oppose the death penalty to
wear black armbands on the execution days.
   There was no counter-protest, but someone in a passing car
shouted, ``Burn, Swindler, burn.''
   Peggy Basnett, the mother of the policeman Swindler killed, also
welcomed the execution. ``It will be a very happy occasion,'' she
said.

Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today said it will decide
the effective date for a 1986 federal law setting tough new minimum
sentences for drug violations.
   At issue is whether the law's penalty provisions took effect in
1986 or 1987.
   The court agreed to hear an appeal by Moshe Gozlon-Peretz, who
was convicted in New Jersey of conspiracy to distribute heroin and
related offenses and was sentenced to 15 years in prison plus five
years of supervised release after he completes his term. He also
was fined $200,000.
   Gozlon-Peretz was caught in a Drug Enforcement Administration
sting when he sold heroin to a federal agent in Atlantic City in
February 1987.
   Gozlon-Peretz said he should not be subject to the five-year
supervised release provisions of the 1986 law because those
provisions did not become effective until Nov. 1, 1987 _ after the
commission of the crime.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the penalty
provisions of the law took effect Oct. 27, 1986, the date the law
was enacted.
   The case is Gozlon-Peretz vs. U.S., 89-7370.

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 12 grafs to UPDATE with Rostenkowski saying big
increase in money for cities unlikely; pick up 6th graf, `Sunday's
votes ...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief tax-writer of the House of
Representatives today bluntly dashed the hopes of mayors seeking
billions of dollars of the expected peace dividend for their
cash-poor cities.
   ``There's no money to pay for such programs,'' House Ways and
Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski told the U.S. Conference
of Mayors. ``The peace dividend is already going to be swallowed.''
   Rostenkowski said budget negotiations between Congress and the
White House are going ``fairly well.'' But he said the budget is
unlikely to include more money for cities.
   ``We need to slash spending and raise taxes merely to reach
ground zero,'' the Chicago Democrat told more than 200 mayors
meeting in his home city.
   Two Democratic mayors challenged Rostenkowski to confront
President Bush and demand that aid to cities be increased. They
said the $500 billion or more needed to bail out the savings and
loan industry should be found elsewhere.
   ``We haven't got the votes,'' Rostenkowski said. He broke off
the questions and left the meeting after telling the mayors
good-naturedly: ``I'm going to tell you like it is. If you don't
like it, too bad.''
   While the mayors expressed affection for Rostenkowski, a
supporter of their causes, they did not like the message.
   ``The cities are in desperate need,'' said Atlanta Mayor Maynard
Jackson. ``I really don't feel we have a partner in Washington.''
   Rostenkowski said he was prepared to support an array of new
taxes. But he said his fellow Democrats want Bush to be the first
one to propose new taxes.
   Rostenkowski was the first of two congressional Democrats to
address the mayors on the first full day of their summer meeting.
Nebraska Sen. Robert Kerrey was to address the mayors at lunch.
   Rostenkowski delivered the dour message to the mayors a day
after they gave initial approval to a broad, costly domestic agenda
that calls on Congress to abandon the Gramm-Rudman law, complaining
the deficit-reduction measure unfairly chops urban programs first.
   ``We're always first in line when it comes to cuts,'' New
Bedford, Mass., Mayor John K. Bullard said Sunday as the mayors
gave initial approval to a sweeping and costly domestic agenda that
would get most of its money from a Congress that has been cutting
aid to cities for a decade.
   Sunday's votes by the conference's key policy committee must be
ratified by the full conference of more than 200 mayors on
Wednesday, but few changes are expected in a plan that blames many
urban woes on federal cutbacks and warns that urban tensions are at
dangerous levels because cities are too strapped for cash to deal
adequately with drugs and housing.
   The centerpiece of the mayors' agenda is a handful of economic
development proposals that include the demand that Congress repeal
the Gramm-Rudman law.
   The mayors said they were reluctant to take that stance but said
they had little choice because Congress and the Bush administration
have failed to negotiate a comprehensive deficit-reduction plan.
Gramm-Rudman imposes automatic cuts if the deficit eclipses certain
targets.
   ``The mayors across this country have got to say this is a
charade,'' said Mayor Lee Robinson of Macon, Ga. ``We've got to say
enough is enough.''
   Mayor Paul Soglin of Madison, Wis., added, ``Too many of our
members of Congress and the administration are seing this as a
crutch to hide some of the problems of our economy.''
   Conference staff members said the mayors would be the first
national organization of elected officials to call from
Gramm-Rudman's repeal.
   Also included in the blueprint is a call for Congress to reduce
the Social Security payroll taxes paid by nearly 120 million
workers and lift the outside earnings cap on Social Security
recipients.
   The plan given initial approval also calls on Congress to stop
using the balance of the Social Security Trust fund to mask the
true size of the deficit. And if formally adopted Wednesday it will
put the mayors on the record in opposition to a reduction in
capital gains taxes favored by President Bush.
   The mayors' agenda, crafted at three days of committee meetings,
also seeks new powers for cities to regulate and remove billboards
along federal roads. But the conference committee that endorsed the
package refused to adopt a measure that would have put the mayors
on record against all tobacco and alcohol advertising.

   The hottest newspaper in East Berlin on
Monday was a special edition of West Berlin's Tageszeitung, which
listed 9,251 addresses purported to be hideouts of the former
secret police.
   Included were addresses said to be secret police vacation homes,
swimming pools, offices, as well as houses and apartments once used
by agents to spy on the country's 16.6 million citizens.
   The Tageszeitung published the list, despite concerns it could
inflame tensions in East Berlin. A supply of several thousand
newspapers quickly sold out at East Berlin's sprawling
Alexanderplatz.
   Tageszeitung, a far-leftist publication, claimed to have
received the list from a committee overseeing the dissolution of
the Communist regime's secret police.
   East Berlin's Interior Ministry had protested the publication of
the list, which included specific apartment numbers.

   Herds of elephants frightened by noise
from loggers' heavy machinery have destroyed many farms in southern
Gabon while fleeing the jungle, the Gabon News Agency reported
Monday.
   The agency said many people face severe food shortages as a
result of the stampedes and have demanded the government chase the
elephants away.
   Four-fifths of this Central African nation is covered by forest,
providing sanctuary for thousands of elephants who face slaughter
elsewhere on the continent.

<TEXT>
   Norwegian environmentalists pushed past
police and violated Soviet and Finnish borders to protest pollution
in the arctic, reports said Monday.
   About 30 local politicians and other protesters, shouting ``Stop
the Soviet death cloud!'' defied Norwegian police Sunday and
chained themselves around a stone marker at the point where the
three countries meet.
   They told reporters that annual emissions of sulphur dioxide
from the Soviet Kola Peninsula are killing Norway's arctic forests.
   ``If we lose the battle against pollution from Kola, we lose
everything we love,'' activist Arne Ulvang told the national NTB
news agency. ``Nature's threshold of pain has been reached. We just
have a few years to save our wilderness.''
   Soviet and Finnish border guards reportedly watched the protest
from a distance. No arrests were made, but the protesters could
face questioning and fines of up to $2,300 for illegally crossing
the border, the Dagbladet newspaper reported.

   Former Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland
boycotted a 45-nation environment conference for engineers Monday
because it was attended by South Africans, organizers said.
   Brundtland, who chaired the United Nations Commission on the
Environment, canceled her opening address after learning that nine
South Africans were among the 300 delegates, said Tom Rollsve, a
conference spokesman
   Norway was not officially represented, making it the first host
country to snub the annual conference opening, said Svein Erik
Noerholm of the FIDIC consulting engineers association.
   ``If they didn't want these people in Norway, then official
Norway should not have granted them visas. What happened is
ridiculous and regrettable,'' Noerholm told the Dagens Naeringliv
business newspaper.
   Norway has embargoed trade with South Africa to protest its
policy of racial segregation, which denies the black majority a
voice in national affairs.

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The foundation that finances the Nobel
prizes on Monday rejected a proposal from 30 laureates to create a
Nobel environmental prize.
   The laureates, including Peace Prize winners Willy Brandt of
West Germany and Adolfo Perez Esquivel of Argentina, suggested the
prize be awarded in the Netherlands by a committee of the Dutch
Parliament.
   ``We fear an inflation of prizes would seriously diminish the
value of those already existing,'' said Stig Ramel, chairman of the
Nobel Foundation.
   The first Nobel prizes were awarded in 1901 from a trust
bequeathed by Alfred Nobel, the Swedish inventor of dynamite. He
established prizes in medicine, chemistry, physics, literature and
peace.
   A sixth prize in economic sciences was established in 1968,
funded by the Bank of Sweden, and was called a Nobel memorial prize
to distinguish it from the others.
   This year each prize is worth $650,000.
   Ramel said there will be no more prizes. The foundation has
exclusive rights to the Nobel name and will not allow it to be
linked to another prize, he said.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of doctors went on strike Monday
for higher pay and brought state hospitals across the country to a
standstill.
   More than 70 percent of the country's 10,000 doctors walked off
the job, said Vassilis Laopodis, vice president of the Greek
Federation of Hospital Doctors' Unions. The strike was to last four
days.
   ``We just want to be paid for the hours we work. We haven't
received a proper increase since 1983, and many overtime shifts go
unpaid,'' Laopodis said in a telephone interview.
   The doctors are demanding a 30 percent salary increase, in
addition to inflationary adjustments covering the past seven years.
   This year, the State Audit Council ruled that public employees
could not earn more than their monthly salary in overtime pay. The
cost-cutting measure could force some clinics to close unless
doctors are willing to work for no pay, according to the doctors'
union.
   The union said interns receive $212 per month, not quite half
the wage of a factory worker.

   A bomb exploded at a government bookstore
Monday and wounded eight people, officials reported.
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, which occurred at
a store run by the Religious Affairs Foundation. The agency
oversees religious affairs in Turkey and came under criticism last
week from Moslems planning to make the holy pilgrimage this year to
Saudi Arabia.
   The Moslems were angry because the agency collected money from
them in advance for the pilgrimages, even though the Saudi
government decided to restrict the number of Moslems allowed into
the country for the annual pilgrimage.
   The foundation collected $740 from each pilgrim for travel and
accommodation expenses. It said it will return the money to those
who are denied Saudi visas.

<HEAD>Matchmaker Heaven: 5,000 Marriages Set Up at Fair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 25,000 men flocked to India's only
marriage fair for matchmaking negotiations, and news reports said
5,000 couples agreed to tie the knot.
   The fair was held over the weekend in a meadow in Bihar state,
about 550 miles southeast of New Delhi.
   Groups of men in sarongs negotiated with the male guardians of
prospective wives. Lineages were checked, with information supplied
by local priests. Negotiations were limited to points such as what
the man earns and what the bride-to-be looks like. No women were
present.
   If the priest gives the go-ahead _ that is if the bride and
groom are not related by blood ties _ the marriage is on. The
couples will meet for the first time at their weddings.
   According to Press Trust of India, the practice was started by a
14th- century king to make it easier for upper-caste Brahmin
families to fix marriages and eliminate the expensive practice of
giving dowries.
   The marriage fair attracts prospects from Brahmin families all
over northern India. Priests reportedly maintain the lineage
registers of Brahmins from 16,800 villages in the region and check
back seven generations to avoid marriages between couples sharing
blood ties.
   The report said the number of people visiting the annual fair is
declining. A few decades ago at leat 150,000 people would visit the
fair each summer, it said.
   The reason for the decline, the report said, was that more
people prefer private negotiations, where questions of dowries can
be raised.
   Although ostensibly outlawed, the dowry practice is widespread
in India, where about 90 percent of marriages are arranged by
families.
   In India, the family of the bride presents a dowry, usually
consisting of gold, to the family of the groom.

<HEAD>World Cup Fever Brings Periods of Calm to Lebanon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ABIR RIAD TAHA</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World Cup fever is sweeping Lebanon. When
matches begin, rival Christian fighters lay down their guns, switch
on their portable television sets and for a while, the country is
calm.
   The only gunfire comes when excited militiamen shoot in the air
in jubilation when their favorite soccer teams score.
   When West Germany played Yugoslavia last week, a group of
scruffy militiamen from Samir Geagea's Christian militia gathered
around a mobile anti-aircraft gun in east Beirut's Ashrafiyeh
district. They watched the game on a portable TV propped up beside
the weapon.
   A few yards away, their rivals _ the troops of Gen. Michel Aoun
_ also watched the game, on a TV powered by a truck battery.
   When West Germany's Lothar Matthaeus scored his second goal,
both groups whooped for joy and fired off clips of bullets into the
air.
   The Germans' 4-1 victory triggered more celebratory gunfire.
   It was easy to forget for a moment that Aoun's troops and
Geagea's militiamen have been fighting since Jan. 30 in a savage
struggle for control of the Christian enclave north of Beirut.
   ``The World Cup has been a godsend,'' said one man in east
Beirut. ``We really needed a diversion, even if it's only for a
month.
   ``We know we'll be going back to the `salt mines' afterward,''
he said, reflecting fears that a cease-fire between Aoun's troops
and Geagea's militiamen will collapse like others have.
   The uneasy cease-fire reached last month is violated frequently.
But when World Cup is on television, both sides are too engrossed
to skirmish.
   Across the devastated city, in the teeming Shiite Moslem slums
of south Beirut, it is the same. The Hezbollah and Amal movements
have been battling for three years for dominance of Lebanon's
Shiites. But when the soccer matches begin in Italy each day,
television sets in the Shiite battleground and across Lebanon
switch on, and the country's 15-year-old civil war eases for a few
hours.
   Electricity in Beirut has been cut off since early February
because the city's power plants were knocked out in the Aoun-Geagea
fighting, so everyone uses generators. The city hums. The
authorities have allowed generators to run until midnight, or until
the end of the last game, whichever comes first.
   Just before the World Cup telecasts begin, the city of Beirut
shuts down. The streets are virtually deserted. Shops are
shuttered. People go home or congregate in bars to watch the games
on TV.
   Entire streets, for reasons known only to their residents,
support different teams. The choice is usually arbitrary.
   Few Lebanese have particular links with any of the countries
competing in Italy. Tiny Lebanon has not had a national soccer team
for years, and when it did, it never got anywhere near qualifying
for the World Cup.
   But Lebanese, like most Arabs, are big on soccer.
   At the American University of Beirut in the city's Moslem
sector, the campus is festooned with the flags of the competing
soccer nations.
   The night Egypt scored a surprise 1-1 tie with the Netherlands,
Arab emotions erupted.
   When the underdog Egyptians held Ireland to a scoreless draw
Sunday, militiamen let their guns rip with wild abandon.
   Joyful AUB students ran through campus carrying burning torches,
beating drums, waving Egyptian flags and lobbing plastic bags
filled with water at by-standers.
   ``I got at least 30 waterbags on my head when I tried to cross
from the dorms to the classrooms,'' said one student.

   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on

   A weekend raid by ``Dick Tracy'' netted an
estimated $22.6 million in box office receipts, including $1.2
million in sales for T-shirts that served as tickets at midnight
openings.
   The total led all other movies for the weekend but was lower
than the early receipts of some recent blockbusters. Disney stock
fell on the news.
   The ``Tracy'' debut put the cuffs on Warner Bros.' ``Gremlins 2:
The New Batch,'' which finished fourth with $9.8 million for its
first weekend.
   In second place behind ``Tracy'' was ``Another 48 HRS.'' with
$11.1 million, followed by ``Total Recall'' with $10.2 million,
according to estimates this morning from Exhibitor Relations Co.
   In fifth place was ``Back to the Future III,'' with $5 million
in ticket sales.
   The debut weekend box-office championship remains with another
comic-book crime fighter, ``Batman,'' which cleaned up $40.5
million for Warner Bros. on a first weekend last summer.
   ``Dick Tracy'' also failed to top the debut earnings of Arnold
Schwarzenegger's ``Total Recall,'' which earned $25 million in its
opening earlier this month.
   Investors regarded the ``Tracy'' results, as well as those for
``Gremlins,'' as disappointing.
   Common stock in the Walt Disney Co., bid up last week on the New
York Stock Exchange on favorable reviews, fell by $3.37{ per share
in midday trading today to $128.37{. Time Warner Inc. stock fell by
$1.12{ to $105.37{ per share.
   But Dick Cook, president of Disney's Buena Vista Pictures
Distribution, said he believes ``Dick Tracy'' has staying power.
   ``It's never where you start, it's where you end,'' Cook said on
Sunday.
   ``The way it's been reviewed, and the favorable way it has been
received _ it is going to do extraordinarily well,'' Cook said in a
telephone interview Sunday. ``And there's a lot of summer left.''
   And there are a lot of movies yet to be released too, including
Tom Cruise in ``Days of Thunder'' and sequels to ``RoboCop'' and
``Die Hard.''
   Nevertheless, Cook said ``Dick Tracy'' was a record opening for
Disney and had all the signs of a summer winner. The movie,
directed by its star, Warren Beatty, features Madonna and a
thieves' den of other big-name actors. Reviews were mostly
favorable.
   Cook estimated a weekend box-office of between $22 million and
$23 million and said ``Dick Tracy'' would get ``double the amount
of business that any other movie will do this weekend.''
   An industry observer who spoke on condition of anonymity said
the opening was ``not great _ somewhere in between. ... It's not a
bad opening.''
   Both noted ``Dick Tracy'' was opening against ``Total Recall,''
``Back to the Future III'' and ``Another 48 HRS.''
   ``Dick Tracy'' opened at 2,223 theaters around the nation with a
new Roger Rabbit cartoon, ``Rollercoaster Rabbit.'' Admission for
midnight Thursday openings was a T-shirt, sold by theaters for as
much as $20 apiece.
   Disney said it will include the price of the T-shirt in its
box-office gross, despite protests from others in the movie
industry that it would inflate the film's numbers.
   ``It is part of the box office, the ticket to the event,'' said
Cook. ``It didn't amount to that much.''
   One source placed the T-shirt boost at $1.2 million to $1.5
million.
   Cook said the opening of ``Dick Tracy'' outstripped Disney first
weekend earnings for ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' which took in
$14.2 million last year, and ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' which
took in $11 million.
   ``Honey'' went on to earn $130 million domestically; ``Roger''
brought home $160 million as the hit of 1988.

   ``I just thought about that on the way to the hospital: it's
Father's Day. And when I got there, all the nurses were

nice,'' the first-time father said.
   Madeline Gonzalez, 30, and her three newborns _ Amparo Crystal,
Esther Christina and Marilyn (no middle name yet) _ were all doing
well at Brooklyn Hospital, said spokeswoman Carol Rubiano.
   The infants, who were three weeks premature, were put in the
neo-natal intensive care unit because of low birth weights. Amparo
weighs 4 pounds, 10 ounces; Esther Christina is 4 pounds, 7 ounces;
and Marilyn is 3 pounds, 7 ounces.
   Gonzales, 29, said he has no plans to mark any future Father's

<HEAD>Kohl Predicts Germanys Will Unite By End of Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Monday
that full unification of the two Germanys will occur this year, but
an East German leader countered that too many questions remain.
   Kohl's remarks came as Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze met to find what
Shevardnadze called ``a common language'' for settling remaining
questions.
   In Britain, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said she was
apprehensive about German unification. ``It's not surprising if you
look back at the history of this century _ World War I and World
War II,'' she told a BBC radio talk show.
   Kohl spoke to a meeting of Christian Democrats that was attended
by East Germany's prime minister, Lothar de Maiziere. Kohl told his
conservative party the year 1990 ``will be the year of German
unity.''
   The comments followed Sunday's stormy session in East Berlin's
parliament, where lawmakers surprisingly agreed to consider
immediate unification. The legislators later backed away from a
vote to dissolve the country and automatically join West Germany.
   Wolfgang Thierse, the leader of East Germany's Social Democrats,
said too many questions on unification remain to be resolved to
permit it to happen this year. The Social Democrats form part of de
Maiziere's governing coalition but favor slower unification than
the Christian Democrats.
   Thierse said lingering topics include the completion of the
two-plus-four talks between the two Germanys and four victorious
World War II Allies _ the United States, Soviet Union, Britain and
France.
   The foreign ministers of the six nations are scheduled to meet
this week to discuss aspects of unification.
   ``It would show insensitivity to our neighbors'' to complete
unification before the two-plus-four talks are completed, Thierse
said.
   His remarks were in reference to the question of what will
happen to former German land ceded to the Poles after World War II.
   Kohl and de Maiziere have already said their governments are
ready to sign a treaty guaranteeing a united Germany will respect
the existing Polish border.
   At Monday's Christian Democratic meeting in Bonn, a resolution
reiterating that guarantee was passed.
   Kohl's Christian Democrats have also called for united German
elections to take place Dec. 9, replacing West Germany's federal
elections currently set for Dec. 2.
   Both the West German and East German Social Democratic parties
are against holding the ballot this year.
   Kohl's main challenger for the chancellorship, Social Democrat
Oskar Lafonatine, has also said they are against quick economic,
monetary and social union with East Germany, which is to take
effect next month.
   However, Kohl said at Monday's meeting he was completely
confident that the West German Bundestag and Bundesrat, the lower
and upper houses of parliament, would ratify a treaty with East
Germany this week to ensure economic and monetary union begins July
2 as planned.
   ``There are no alternatives,'' Kohl said.
   The symbolic vote of 267-92 in East Berlin's parliament on
Sunday for discussions on immediate unity also bolstered Kohl's
confidence, giving him a preview of how strong support for
unification is in East Germany.
   Among the issues covered by Shevardnadze and Genscher in the
city of Muenster was a united Germany's military alliance once the
two countries have merged.
   The United States, and Kohl and Genscher, support a united
Germany being in NATO. The Soviets oppose NATO membership for the
new country.

   An infant survived a two-story fall
without injury when a baby sitter dropped her from a smoky
apartment into the hands of a former high school basketball player,
authorities said.
   ``I got some sure hands, man. Sure hands,'' James Harris, 39,
said after making the catch of his life Sunday.
   Eight-week-old Heather Lynn Yeckley slept soundly after the
ordeal as firefighters doused the apartment fire.
   Sitter Robin Stilwell said she found herself trapped by heat and
smoke when she awakened from a noontime nap.
   ``I couldn't get out the door,'' she said, so she grabbed the
baby and rushed to a window.
   Firefighters arrived just as the baby was dropped to Harris.
They rescued Ms. Stilwell, 21, from the window with a ladder.
   Paramedics said Ms. Stilwell appeared to be overcome with fear
and didn't heed their shouts no to drop the child. No one was
seriously injured in the blaze.
   Investigators blamed the fire on an old television in another
apartment.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
met today with five Central American presidents and discussed how
to coordinate U.S. and other foreign aid to build the region's
economies.
   He arrived in Antigua on Sunday night to attend the close of the
three-day meeting, in which the Central American leaders agreed to
form a Central American Economic Community to fight poverty.
   Officials said Baker outlined a plan for coordinating aid, trade
and investment in Central America from a variety of nations and
organizations.
   The idea is based on the model adopted by a group of 24
developed nations for helping Poland and Hungary make the
transition to free-market democracies.
   Baker's proposal is seen as a clear affirmation of U.S.
intentions to maintain its traditional influence in the region.
   After a breakfast meeting with Baker, President Rafael Callejas
of Honduras told a joint news conference the Central American
leaders fully expect the U.S. proposal to mean additional aid for
the region, but that no specific sums _ nor the touchy issue of who
would manage the program _ had been discussed.
   The United States has been saying it wants to manage the
program, but the region's leaders have indicated they want to
manage it themselves or have the final decision on who would run it.
   ``We didn't talk about sums or structures,'' Callejas said.
   Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani said there will be more
detailed discussions at the next Central American summit, to be
held sometime within the next three months in Costa Rica.
   He said Baker had committed the United States to further talks
with the donor countries. Among the industrialized nations expected
to provide Central America with aid are Japan, Canada and the
European Economic Community.
   Baker also was to hold individual meetings with each of the
presidents today.
   The presidents _ all elected civilians _ agreed in two accords
Sunday night to try to mesh the region's economies. They pledged
coordinated action on foreign trade and debt, on rebuilding
infrastructures, on agricultural and industrial policy and
attracting investment.
   Costa Rican President Rafael Calderon said the region, deeply
scarred by a decade of civil strife, needs international support.
   ``We don't extend our hand to ask for charity,'' Calderon said.
``But we say to you, here are the Central American people who are
willing to give their labor, their effort and their dedication but
who also need the friendly hand of the developing world.''
   Callejas has said Central America needs at least $2.5 billion in
aid over the next three years to begin rebuilding.
   The task will be immense. According to a study by the U.N.
Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the
regional gross domestic product has fallen 20 percent since 1978.
   The summit marked a turning point for Central America, which has
suffered decades of dictatorship, revolution and political, social
and economic crisis.
   ``War and violence are an act of human cruelty, but poverty is
an act of human abandonment we must confront,'' the presidents of
Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras and Costa Rica said in
their accords.
   ``Violence is a part of our history we will not forget, but we
must not repeat. Now we set out on other roads.''
   The Antigua meeting was the eighth Central American summit, but
the first to deal almost exclusively with economic issues.
   The presidents hope to repeat the success of the Nobel
Prize-winning regional peace plan. In Nicaragua, the plan helped
end the war and brought elections that ousted Central America's
only leftist government.
   The peace plan was also the catalyst for peace talks now under
way between leftist rebels and the governments of El Salvador and
Guatemala.
   The economic accords reflect a search for solutions acceptable
to the region's powerful vested interests.
   Attempts to redistribute wealth have cost tens of thousands of
lives, and the development agenda for the 1990s aims at generating
more wealth instead of at redistribution.
   Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro and Costa Rican
President Calderon, both elected this year, signed the plan as
first-time participants in a regional summit.
   Signing for Guatemala was President Vinicio Cerezo.
   Panamanian President Guillermo Endara signed as an invited
observer.

   A 9-year-old boy had just taken his seat at a
Father's Day family dinner when he slumped suddenly _ a bullet
lodged in his skull.
   ``You are not even safe in our own back yard,'' said the
victim's mother, Christine Philpott.
   After surgery Sunday to remove the slug, Dale Philpott was
alert, talking with his parents and complaining that he was hungry.
   ``It certainly is a mystery,'' said Hillsborough sheriff's
Detective Rich Figueredo. ``We have no idea at this point whether
it was accidental or deliberate.''
   Twenty family members had gathered on an open-air porch in the
back of the boy's grandparents' home for dinner.
   ``We weren't sure what was wrong with him until we looked at the
back of his head and saw the hole,'' said Mary Lou Heyer, the boy's
great aunt.
   At Humana Hospital Brandon, X-rays revealed a bullet lodged in
his skull.
   ``We are real lucky. Another centimeter and the doctor said Dale
would be dead,'' Mrs. Philpott said.

   Crews started laying booms and
volunteers began cleaning up beaches today to make them ready for
an oil slick expected to wash ashore Tuesday from the wrecked
supertanker Mega Borg.
   ``We cannot wait any longer,'' Texas Land Commissioner Gary
Mauro said. ``We don't know if oil or tar balls will ever make it
to the coast, but we have to get ready.''
   Although 200 or more volunteers were expected, only about 60
initially showed up this morning at Sea Rim State Park to get ready
for the slick to hit the beach. They walked the sandy beaches
picking up seaweed and garbage to make it easier to clean up any
tar balls that may wash ashore.
   Tar balls were expected to begin showing up Tuesday along the
45-mile stretch of coastline from High Island, some 30 miles north
of Galveston, to Sabine Pass at the Texas-Louisiana line, the Coast
Guard said.
   Officials tracking the 30-mile slick, situated about 10 miles
offshore Sunday, hoped the oil would hit the area's small, sandy
beaches instead of its marshes, which include wildlife refuges.
   ``If it hits the marshlands, it seeps into the ground and kills
off the vegetation and the eggs in that area,'' said Gary Clark,
president of the Houston Audubon Society. He said birds could then
face starvation.
   Sandy beaches also are easier to clean, officials said.
   Crews on Sunday stretched a boom across the eastern end of
Bolivar Peninsula, between Galveston and High Island, to deflect
any oil from marshy areas.
   Coast Guard officials said the 886-foot Norwegian tanker,
crippled 57 miles off Galveston by an explosion June 8, has stopped
leaking oil. The vessel had been carrying 38 million gallons when
the blast occurred.
   The Coast Guard also lowered the spill estimate from 4.6 million
gallons to 3.9 million, still the fifth-largest U.S. spill.
Officials said salvage crews found about 700,000 gallons in smaller
tanks that catch runoff from the larger tanks on the ship.
   Two crew members died and two are missing and presumed dead. The
cause of the blast, which occurred when the ship was transferring
oil to a smaller vessel, has not been determined.
   Most of the spilled oil either evaporated or burned in fires
that raged on the ship for a week, officials said. Twelve skimmer
vessels have captured 250,000 gallons of the crude, according to
the Coast Guard.
   Cleanup crews had expected the Angolan light crude to begin
washing ashore late Sunday near Galveston, but shifting winds
pushed the slick to the northeast, parallel to the coast.
   In the first open-sea use of a process called bioremediation,
which uses bacteria to break down oil into a harmless fatty
substance, oil-eating microbes spread over part of the slick appear
to have worked, state officials said.
   On Friday, about 100 pounds of bacteria were spread over an
acre. A flyover Sunday showed little oil in the treated water, but
a second experiment was planned to confirm whether the process
worked or whether the oil was removed by the current, officials
said.
   Meanwhile, salvage crews working on the Mega Borg began
transferring oil from a ruptured cargo tank to another holding bin
aboard the vessel.
   Crews from Smit America Salvage Inc. also began pumping water
out of another holding tank that flooded during the firefighting.
   Once those operations are finished, crews will probably start
transferring the rest of the ship's cargo to smaller vessels, the
Coast Guard said.
   By Sunday, crews had stopped dousing the hull of the Mega Borg.
Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Mark Sedwick said officials
believed there was no longer a threat of the fire reigniting.
   Divers attempting to rescue five loggerhead sea turtles spotted
Saturday near the edge of the slick were unable to locate the
reptiles, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.
NOAA planned to continue searching for members of the threatened
species.

<HEAD>Conservative Soviet Politburo Member Critical of Steps Toward
Capitalism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leading conservative on the Soviet Politburo,
Yegor K. Ligachev, on Monday criticized advocates of a free market
and called for a referendum on whether the nation should be
capitalist or socialist.
   Ligachev spoke out in an interview published by the Communist
Party newspaper Pravda. In two weeks, the party is to open a
crucial congress to debate the course of reform.
   ``Let's ask the people what direction restructuring should take
_ to socialism or capitalism. Let's hold a national referendum,''
Ligachev said.
   He outlined a traditional Marxist-Leninist position that
contrasted sharply with calls for reform being heard in the Soviet
media and legislative bodies, and he urged that the nation stick
with a planned market economy.
   ``Those who advocate a free market are pushing us back to
private appropriation of the results of the labor of other people
to their exploitation,'' he said.
   ``We have already realized the destructiveness of such `freedom'
at the macrolevel, when large units and republics try to secede
from an integrated community, thereby harming other republics and
peoples,'' he said, alluding to the steps toward independence by
the Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.
   Meanwhile, the reformist weekly Ogonyok published results of an
opinion poll that indicated diminished support for the Communist
Party among Soviet citizens.
   The poll was conducted by the All-Union Center for the Study of
Public Opinion. It said that of Soviets surveyed last month, 49
percent believed the Communist Party was ``losing the initiative.''
   Ogonyok said 11.2 percent of those surveyed thought the party
was ``leading society on the path to democratic renewal,'' while
13.8 percent thought ``the party was putting the brakes on the
process of democratic renewal.''
   Asked which institutions commanded the most authority in the
Soviet Union, 61.8 percent expressed ``complete faith'' in the
army, 47.9 percent complete faith in the church and 40.8 percent
complete faith in the Supreme Soviet legislation, the three most
respected bodies.
   At the low end of the scale were the Communist Party, with 29.5
percent expressing complete faith, the police with 22.2 percent and
the Young Communist League with 10.1 percent.
   The poll did not say how many people were questioned or give a
margin of error.

<TEXT>
   The state of Florida will test the new
legal climate for abortion restrictions this week when it asks a
federal judge for more authority to regulate abortion clinics.
   Eight years ago, U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez issued a
ruling that limited regulation of private abortion clinics to four
areas. On Tuesday, Gonzalez is to hear testimony and arguments in
his Fort Lauderdale courtroom over proposed changes in that
injunction.
   State officials hope the result will be a ruling that gives them
broader powers to regulate sanitation and other aspects of abortion
clinic operations. Abortion rights activists hope Gonzalez will
continue to give the state only limited authority over the clinics.
   This is the second high-profile case in a month for Gonzalez,
who on June 6 declared an album by the rap group 2 Live Crew to be
obscene.
   In the abortion case, the state has argued that current rules of
Florida's Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services aren't
strong enough to guarantee public health and safety.
   ``Women served by abortion clinics are now treated as
second-class citizens in comparison to similar patients at birthing
centers and ambulatory surgical centers,'' the motion says.
   Charlene Carres, a lawyer representing a Fort Lauderdale clinic
owner named as a plaintiff in the class-action lawsuit, said the
state wants to further regulate a procedure that already is safe
and protected as a fundamental privacy right.
   ``There is no justification for changing the injunction, mainly
because the safety of abortion has not declined since 1982,''
Carres said last week, citing the state's own statistics that
first-trimester abortions are far safer than childbirth.
   While a single abortion-related death is recorded every few
years, she said, anywhere from 15 to 23 childbirth-related deaths
occur each year.
   ``The numbers of death and injuries from abortion is so low it's
even difficult to make a valid statistical comparison,'' Carres
said.
   The state has less faith in that data because women are
reluctant to come forward with complaints about abortions, said Jim
Peters, assistant attorney general.
   In its motion before Gonzalez, the state says it can no longer
rely on the assumption that first-trimester abortions are safer
than childbirth.
   In 1982, Gonzalez said the state can inspect only to see if the
clinic posts its license, maintains records, properly disposes of
fetal remains and allows only physicians to perform abortions.
   Under the judge's order, the state is not allowed to enforce
requirements on minimum care standards, transportation of patients
in emergencies, staffing and equipment.
   The state didn't appeal Gonzalez's ruling, but Peters said that
a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last summer and a Florida newspaper
article last fall justified a change in the order to let the state
inspect abortion clinics for such aspects as sanitation and
infection control, equipment maintenance, staffing, emergency
procedures, medicine storage and administration.
   In its Webster ruling last July, the nation's high court upheld
a Missouri law requiring viability testing of fetuses before
allowing abortions after 20 weeks.
   Two months later, The Miami Herald detailed dirty and dangerous
conditions in South Florida clinics created an unroar, prompting
HRS to use emergency powers under Florida's public health statute
to close four clinics.

<TEXT>
   PLO guerrillas swept through a refugee camp
in southern Lebanon on Monday and disarmed followers of the
notorious terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal, police said.
   The operation followed weekend fighting between supporters and
opponents of Abu Nidal within his Fatah-Revolutionary Council
group. At least five people were killed in the violence.
   Police said about 100 Palestine Liberation Organization military
policemen seized all weapons of Abu Nidal's followers in a
house-to-house search in the Rashidiyeh refugee camp, outside Tyre.
   ``Abu Nidal's base in Rashidiyeh has been dismantled. He has no
followers left here,'' said a police spokesman in Tyre, who cannot
be named under standing rules.
   He said 40 Abu Nidal loyalists surrendered to the PLO on Sunday,
and a dozen were arrested in Monday's operation.
   PLO sources, who refused to give their names, said Abu Nidal
still has about 150 followers in the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp,
which is near the southern port city of Sidon, and in hills east of
Sidon.
   Two kidnapped employees of the International Committee of the
Red Cross are believed held in the Sidon area. The Swiss hostages,
Emmanuel Christen, 32, and Elio Erriquez, 23, were abducted Oct. 6,
1989 near a Red Cross orthopedic center that cared for war victims.
   Lebanese police and the PLO blamed the kidnappings on Abu Nidal.
His group denied responsibility.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, is believed to be
in Libya.
   A U.S. State Department report last year described Abu Nidal as
the world's most dangerous terrorist. It blamed his hirelings for
34 terrorist attacks in 20 countries since he split from Yasser
Arafat's PLO in 1973.
   At least 900 people were killed or wounded in these attacks, the
report said. The atrocities included the December 1985 attacks on
Rome and Vienna airports that killed more than 20 people.

   Businesses caught illegally employing 3,800
youngsters during a one-day federal sweep this month face more than
$1 million in fines, the Labor Department said Monday.
   Most of the child labor violations involved youngsters working
more hours than is allowed under federal labor law, the agency said.
   But there were also 490 minors, mostly 16- and 17-year-olds, who
were working at dangerous tasks such as using power-driven meat
slicers or paper-baling machines.
   The June 6 sweep, in which investigators visited 2,033
businesses, uncovered violations in 753 establishments, or at 37
percent of the companies visited nationwide, the department said.
The names of the companies were not released.
   The most recent sweep is part of an ongoing effort to crack down
on employers illegally using teen-age labor.
   In March, investigators working on a three-day sweep visited
3,400 businesses and found that nearly half were in apparent
violation of child labor laws.
   Investigators have found 15,500 violations as a result of the
March sweep. Fines from that effort are expected to total $5
million.
   Federal law forbids 14-year-olds and 15-year-olds from working
more than three hours on a school day or 18 hours in a week during
the school year. Eight hours are permitted on weekend days and
40-hour weeks are permitted in summer and during school vacations.
   Youngsters under 14 are prohibited from working in all but a few
exempt jobs, such as newspaper delivery workers.

<HEAD>Witnesses Allege Sexual Bias in Medical Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government medical research is so sexually
biased that even male laboratory rats are the preferred animal for
studies, according to congressional testimony Monday.
   ``What it's really saying is, it's OK to put women's health at
risk,'' Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., told the House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee on Health and the Environment.
   She was among critics who say clinical trials and the resulting
data are skewed in favor of men.
   The lack of gender-specific data ``communicates to doctors that
women really aren't that much at risk,'' she said. As a result,
women's problems often aren't taken seriously until they reach a
critical stage.
   The National Institutes of Health has a $7.6 billion research
budget this year. An NIH advisory committee reported in 1987 that
less than 14 percent of the institute's budget went to women's
health issues even though women make up more than half the
population, Schroeder said.
   Only $17 million is spent on basic breast cancer research
annually while less than 2 percent of NIH grants for research went
to obstetric and gynecological programs in 1986 and 1987, she said.
   Heart disease and cancers of the lung and breast are the top
killers of women.
   NIH has only three obstetrician-gynecologists on its permanent
staff, added Schroeder, mentioning also a ``dearth'' of money for
research on infertility and contraception.
   Schroeder also referred to conclusions of a congressionally
mandated study that the National Institutes of Health has made
little progress in implementing its policy of including women in
research study populations.
   The policy, announced in October 1986, has neither been well
communicated nor well understood, the draft study by the
congressional General Accounting Office said. The report was
released at the hearing.
   Although NIH was not given the customary opportunity to review
the draft and have its comments made part of the final report
before its release, the acting head of the institutes said he
generally agreed with its findings.
   ``My colleagues and I agree that the matter warrants sustained,
high priority attention,'' said William Raub, referring to the
``arrogance or indifference'' of scientists who knew the policy but
refused to implement it.
   He acknowledged under questioning by Rep. Henry A. Waxman,
D-Calif., the subcommittee chairman, that most laboratory
researchers begin their work using male animals to rule out the
menstrual cycle as a variable.
   Raub said this ``control'' is usually confined to the early
stages of research. Waxman asked whether such a control skewed the
results from the outset, and Raub acknowledged that the control
argument has been ``an overworked and overused rationale.''
   Dr. Claude L'Enfant, head of the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute, disputed one of the key assertions of the GAO report:
that research on the effects of aspirin in preventing heart attacks
in women was blocked because of cost concerns.
   L'Enfant said the only reason for leaving women out of the study
begun in 1981 on aspirin and heart attacks was that its design was
flawed.

   A fuel oil barge being towed by a
tugboat ran aground in Buzzards Bay this morning, but leaked only
briefly, the Coast Guard said.
   The barge hit within one mile of the site where the cruise ship
the Bermuda Star ran aground in fog June 10, officials said.
   The barge stopped leaking shortly after it hit the rocks and
Coast Guard crews planned to pump remaining fuel out and refloat
the barge, Petty Officer Jim Chenard said.
   The Rea Bouchard was carrying between 7,500 and 8,000 barrels of
fuel oil, Chenard said. It hit bottom about one half-mile northwest
of Cleveland Ledge Light.
   The seagoing crash was first reported about 10:30 a.m. Mello
said the Coast Guard dispatched vessels with oil-catching booms
shortly before 11 a.m.
   The Bermuda Star ran aground with hundreds of passengers and
crew aboard, ripping a 90-foot gash in its hull and spilling
thousands of gallons of diesel fuel. Those on board were ferried to
safety.
   Buzzards Bay fronts the western shore of Cape Cod, about 50
miles southeast of Boston.

<HEAD>Court Will Use Case of California Eye Surgeon to Study Antitrust
Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court said today it will use the
case of an eye surgeon denied staff privileges at a Los Angeles
hospital to study the scope of a key federal antitrust law.
   The justices agreed to hear an appeal by the hospital seeking to
dismiss the doctor's antitrust suit. A ruling is not expected until
next year.
   The case stems from a dispute between Dr. Simon Pinhas and
Midway Hospital Medical Center, which is owned by Summit Health Ltd.
   Pinhas, a member of Midway's staff since 1981, protested in 1986
a hospital requirement that an assistant surgeon be present for the
performance of eye surgery.
   Medicare reimbursement for assistant eye surgeons was
discontinued in 1986, and Pinhas said requiring him to have an
assistant present when he performed operations would cost him
$60,000 a year.
   The hospital refused to abolish the assistant surgeon
requirement but offered Pinhas what he called a sham contract
promising to pay him $60,000 a year for non-existent consulting
services.
   Pinhas refused to sign the contract or to return it to hospital
officials.
   He said that prompted hospital administrators to suspend his
staff privileges at Midway.
   He then sued, accusing hospital officials of engaging in an
anti-competitive conspiracy forbidden by the Sherman Antitrust Act.
He said the officials boycotted his practice and prevented his
continued competition in the marketplace.
   A federal judge threw out the suit. But it was reinstated last
year by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   At issue is whether there is enough of a connection with
interstate commerce to invoke the Sherman Antitrust Act.
   The 9th Circuit court said Pinhas ``need only prove that
peer-review proceedings have an effect on interstate commerce, a
fact that can hardly be disputed. The proceedings affect the entire
staff at Midway and thus affect the hospital's interstate
commerce.''
   Hospital officials said Pinhas should be required to show that
the hospital's alleged anti-competitive conduct affects interstate
commerce, not merely that the hospital is engaged in interstate
commerce.
   The California Association of Hospitals and Health Systems
supported Midway's appeal.
   The case is Summith Health Ltd. vs. Pinhas, 89-1679.

   A man whose car had been repossessed
methodically gunned down customers and employees at a GM financing
agency today, killing seven people and critically wounding six
others before committing suicide, police said.
   ``He just started walking through the building and shooting,''
Jacksonville Sheriff James McMillan said.
   The unidentified gunman used a .30-caliber semiautomatic rifle
and a .38-caliber revolver in the shootings, and may be connected
with two other weekend shootings usin the same kind of rifle, the
sheriff said.
   ``It's just a terrible, terrible, senseless thing,'' said
McMillan.
   The shootings occurred inside the General Motors Acceptance
Corp. building at the Baymeadows Office Park just before 11 a.m.
EDT, said Jacksonville police spokesman Sgt. Steve Weintraub. GMAC
is the car-financing arm of the General Motors Corp. McMillan said
the man's car had been repossessed.
   The sheriff said the man went up to the counter, shot a customer
and then began walking through the office shooting his weapons.
Most of the shots apparently came from the rifle, McMillan said.
   Richard Langille, a GMAC employee, said as soon as employees
heard gunfire, they dived beneath their desks.
   ``And then we realized the guy was pointing his gun underneath
people's desks and killing them one by one,'' said Langille. ``I
just saw the bottom of the carpet and just prayed.''
   Five employees and another customer, along with the gunman, died
at the scene, said John Andrews, a spokesman for GMAC in Detroit.
McMillan said an eighth person _ a GMAC employee whose husband was
a police officer _ died shortly after being transported to a
hospital.
   The gunman killed himself at the end of the shootings, said the
sheriff.
   The wounded were airlifted or taken by ambulance to two local
hospitals, University Hospital and Baptist Medical Center, where
they were all described as in critical condition.
   Jay Edelberg, of Baptist Medical Center, said the three wounded
brought there had been shot repeatedly.
   One man had gunshot wounds on both sides of his chest and in his
abdomen, and was on the operating table, he said. A woman, also in
the operating room was shot on both sides of her chest and bleeding
from her abdomen.
   ``The third one, who is the most stable, probably had the worst
injuries because she got hit about seven times, hitting her arms,
her legs, shattering bones and severing nerves and arteries,'' the
Baptist spokesman said.
   Vince Scolaro, spokesman with University Hospital, said the
facility had three patients from the shooting, all in the trauma
center. They, too, were all in critical condition.
   Ambulances, police and office workers from surrounding companies
circled the office building soon after the shooting.
   Several large corporations have their regional headquarters in
the office park, which lies south of downtown Jacksonville.
   Fred Bateh, owner of a sandwich shop across the street, said a
GMAC employee ran into his store about 10:45 a.m. and said
``somebody's shooting people at close range. A lot of them are
dead.''
   The massacre was the worst since Sept. 14, 1989, when Joseph T.
Wesbecker, a 47-year-old pressman on disability for mental illness,
fatally shot eight people and wounded 12 others at a printing plant
in Louisville, Ky., before taking his own life.

<HEAD>House Sends Zionism Bill to Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Monday passed and sent to
President Bush a bill calling on the United Nations to repeal a
15-year-old resolution equating Zionism with racism.
   On a voice vote, the lawmakers approved a measure rhetorically
asking ``all member states of the United Nations General Assembly
to take immediate action'' to repeal U.N. Resolution 3379, passed
in 1975.
   The congressional legislation, passed May 3 by the Senate, also
requires the president to report to Congress periodically on
progress toward repeal. The administration supports the bill and is
expected to sign it.
   The resolution states that the U.N. action has been used to
justify terrorist attacks, has encouraged anti-semitism and has
been a device to damage Israel's legitimacy.
   Zionism, the movement to establish a Jewish homeland, is opposed
by many of Israel's Arab neighbors and their allies.
   But John Bolton, assistant secretary of state for international
organizations, told Congress in March that some countries which
voted for the resolution now have changed their thinking. He said
U.S. officials are talking with U.N. member nations, including the
Soviet Union, about repeal.
   The administration would like to act on the issue when the
General Assembly reconvenes in the fall, Bolton said, but will not
take up the matter unless repeal is assured.

<HEAD>White House Says Bush Ready to Veto Family Leave Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Candidate George Bush advocated job protection
for parental care, but President Bush is ready to veto a bill that
would offer such protection.
   The White House on Monday denied any conflict between the two
stances, suggesting that Bush _ now as then _ supports such
protection only if it is voluntary for employers.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush stands ready to
cast the 13th veto of his presidency on the parental-care bill.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised to see it this week,'' Fitzwater said.
   The measure, passed by Congress last week, would guarantee
workers as much as 12 weeks' unpaid leave for childbirth, adoption
or serious family illnesses. The measure would apply to all
businesses with 50 or more employees.
   During his presidential campaign, Bush touched on the issue
Sept. 9, 1988.
   ``Look, we also need to assure that women don't have to worry
about getting their jobs back after having a child or caring for a
child during serious illness,'' he told the Illinois Federation of
Republican Women in Rockford.
   Fitzwater, who was President Reagan's spokesman throughout 1988
and did not work in the Bush campaign, said he was unaware of those
Bush comments.
   But, Fitzwater said, the president opposes the present
legislation because ``it is a federally mandated benefit and we're
opposed to federally mandated benefits.''
   Deputy press secretary Alixe Glen, who was a 1988 campaign aide
to Bush, said the president ``supports and encourages'' parental
and medical leave policies designed to meet the needs of individual
companies and employees.
   ``He has always been opposed to the federal government dictating
or mandating what every business in this country should do,'' she
said. ``This particular bill would badly impact a lot of companies.
   ``It reduces small business flexibility, reduces U.S.
competitiveness and really could undermine the current trend toward
flexible policies,'' Ms. Glen said.

   The Bush administration has asked Congress to
add $10 million or $15 million to a secret arms program for rebels
fighting the Soviet-backed government of Angola, a congresional
source said Monday.
   Some of the money would be used to buy Hawk anti-aircraft
missiles, adding to an arsenal of shoulder-fired Stinger rockets
the rebels have used to attack government planes, said the source,
who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   The request for the extra money prompted an angry letter from
the Congressional Black Caucus to Sen. David Boren, D-Okla.,
chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee which oversees the
U.S. aid.
   Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., head of the caucus, said U.S.
weapons were directly responsible for rebel landmines that have
resulted in Angola having the largest population of amputees in the
world, according to Red Cross figures. He called U.S. aid ``morally
indefensible.''
   In the June 12 letter, Dellums told Boren he was writing ``in
advance of reported pending action in your committee which would
again direct United States resources'' to the Angolan rebels.
   He said the caucus ``is unalterably opposed to congressional
action to direct American aid to (rebel) forces'' and asked Boren
and his committee ``to reject all attempts to allow U.S. resources
to enter this war region.''
   Word of the request for extra money came as representatives of
Angola's Marxist government met in Portugal with rebels of the
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to discuss a
cease-fire and an end to their country's 15-year civil war.
   The current annual allocation for the secret program, which is
handled by the CIA and overseen by the House and Senate
intelligence committees, is thought to be $50 million this fiscal
year that ends Sept. 30.
   The program grew from an estimated $30 million two years ago,
partly to make up a shortfall caused by South Africa's agreement to
stop arming UNITA.
   The United States airlifted large quantities of weapons to UNITA
last January to counter a massive government offensive into
rebel-held territory.
   Rebel leaders credit the airlift, which followed a hiatus of
several months in U.S. arms supplies, with helping to turn the tide
against government forces and bring about their retreat from the
strategic town of Mavinga last month.
   But UNITA representatives have said recently that their stocks
were depleted by the battle for Mavinga and that they would require
additional arms.
   The Soviet Union, which supports Angola's government with $800
million annually, according to the State Department, has proposed
to the United States a cessation of arms to both sides.
   Secretary of State James Baker said last week the United States
would only consider stopping its support for UNITA if the
government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos agrees to rebel
demands for free elections in the one-party state.
   But he disclosed that the Americans and Soviets have proposed
joint sponsorship of peace talks between the sides.
   U.S. officials argue that Angolan forces have far bigger
stockpiles of weapons than the rebels, and an arms cutoff now would
place UNITA at a disadvantage.
   UNITA has been fighting the government since shortly after
Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975. An initial
cease-fire mediated by Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko last June
collapsed within days and peace talks only restarted in April in
Evora, Portugal.

<HEAD>21 Tibetans Arrested in Lhasa, Says Dalai Lama's Office</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese authorities arrested 13 monks
and 10 students this month in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, the
Dalai Lama's office in India said Monday.
   A statement by the office quoted an unnamed visitor to Lhasa as
saying the monks were arrested June 8 in central Lhasa when they
tried to demonstrate against Chinese rule of Tibet.
   Later that day, about 100 students of Tibet University held a
pro-independence rally, which armed policemen broke up, the
statement quoted unidentified witnesses as saying. It quoted an
unidentified tourist as saying gunshots were heard during the
police action.
   The reported demonstration coincided with the Tibetan religious
festival of Saka Dawa, the statement said.
   It said no further details of the June 8 incident were available
but added that this was the first reported demonstration since the
lifting of martial law in Lhasa on May 1. China had imposed martial
law in Lhasa 13 months earlier to prevent pro-independence riots.
   Chinese troops marched into Tibet in 1950. Nine years later, an
uprising led by the Dalai Lama, Tibetans' spiritual leader, was
crushed. The Dalai Lama fled with 80,000 followers to India, where
he set up his government-in-exile.
   More than 6 million Tibetans worldwide rever the Dalai Lama, who
won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for his peaceful resistance to
Chinese rule.
   Beijing claims Tibet has been part of China since the 13th
century.

   The House on Monday approved spending up to
$50 million next year to help screen low-income women for breast
and cervical cancer.
   The measure was approved on a voice vote and goes to the Senate.
   It would authorize the Centers for Disease Control to make
grants to states to set up screening programs and educate the
public about the need for screening.
   States seeking the grants would need to provide $1 for every
three federal dollars and give priority in their programs to
low-income women.
   Even if the measure is approved by the Senate and signed into
law, Congress would still have to take additional action to
appropriate the money needed to carry out the programs.
   In separate action, the House also approved a $36 million
reauthorization of the CDC's tuberculosis control program. That
measure also was passed on a voice vote and sent to the Senate.

   A parliamentary chamber on Monday gave
police and soldiers authority to move against government opponents
who re-took a Bucharest square after being brutally routed by
police last week.
   Also Monday, opposition parlimentarians demanded the government
investigate the events that led President-elect Ion Iliescu to
summon thousands of miners to help crush the unrest last week. The
miners, swinging iron bars and sticks, beat anyone they suspected
of opposing Iliescu.
   A student leader who was severely beaten was taken into police
custody Monday and charged with helping incite the unrest.
   Hundreds of people gathered for a second day in University
Square to demand the ouster of Iliescu, and students said they
would go on strike Tuesday.
   Iliescu's inauguration had been scheduled for last week and has
been postponed for later this week amid the turmoil.
   Of the lawmakers present in the newly elected 377-member Chamber
of Deputies, only 72 voted against the motion to have ``the forces
of law and order'' end the University Square demonstration. Seven
abstained.
   The vote split generally along party lines, with deputies of
Iliescu's National Salvation Front and splinter parties supporting
it, and the three main opposition parties against it.
   It was unclear when action might be taken against the
protesters, who numbered about 300 late Monday. Passage was
virtually certain in the Senate, where the Front also holds a clear
majority.
   The unrest began Wednesday, when police broke up a 535-day
sit-in by protesters demanding Iliescu and other Communists be
banned from office. When the unrest continued, Iliescu summoned
thousands of miners to the city to crush the protests.
   Six people were killed and more than 500 injured in the ensuing
violence, the worst since the December uprising that toppled
Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Student leader Marian Munteanu was moved Monday from the
Emergency Hospital to a police hospital after being charged with
``instigation and participation in violence,'' according to his
opposition group, the Students League.
   Munteanu was beaten and suffered a fractured skull and broken
left leg and arm, doctors said.
   The league told a news conference that students and faculty at
the University of Bucharest would go on strike Tuesday to protest
violence directed at them in the past few days.
   On Sunday, force was not used against the demonstrators, and the
government promised dialogue.
   There was no sign Monday of talks between the two sides.
   The protesters, who demand Iliescu and other ex-Communists be
banned from politics, shouted ``Down with Iliescu!''
   Some spectators berated them and urged them to disperse. Two
truckloads of army troops equipped with nightsticks and machine
guns were parked nearby.
   Sen. Radu Campeanu, head of the Liberal Party, told reporters as
lawmakers convened that his party would push for a special
parliametary commission to investigate the clashes. His party's
officies were sacked.
   Outside Parliament, Dan Iosif, a senator close to Iliescu,
defended the government's actions. He said there were ``excesses on
both sides'' but insisted the miners' excesses were ``not so
blameworthy.''
   Iliescu did nothing to stop the attacks, and his tactics cost
the government Western aid.
   The violence ended after he thanked the miners ``with all my
heart'' and ordered them home late Friday.
   That miners were called in to put down Thursday's rioting raised
questions about whether Iliescu commands the loyalty of the police
and army. Some Romanians wondered whether Iliescu's Front might
have provoked the unrest in order to crack down on the opposition.
   The government claims Wednesday's rioting constituted a
right-wing revolt. It has said the miners seized incriminating
material from opposition party headquarters and elsewhere _ but has
yet to produce any evidence.
   The University Square demonstrators accuse Iliescu's Front,
which took power in the December revolution, of running a disguised
version of the old Communist order.
   The Front won May 20 elections by a landslide, but Iliescu and
many other of its leaders are former high-ranking Communist
officials and opposition activists are demanding that former
Communists be barred from holding office.

<TEXT>
   The head of Burma's military junta on
Monday stressed that his government will not be rushed into handing
over power to the civilian opposition that won national elections
on May 27.
   Gen. Saw Maung said a new constitution must be drafted and
emphasized that it will be a complicated and lengthy process. He
spoke to members of historical commission.
   ``A constitution should be sound and stable so that there would
be no subsequent problems arising out of its shortcomings,'' he
said.
   He implied that the constitution adopted in 1947 at the end of
British rule was flawed and led to national strife that climaxed
with the 1988 civilian uprising against the military.
   Burmese took to the streets that year to press for democracy,
briefly triumphed, then were brutally crushed by army gunfire.
Several thousand civilians were killed.
   ``We will not tolerate recurrence of the 1988 situation,'' said
the general, ``and will not tolerate endangerment to our three
basic duties _ preventing disintegration of the union, preventing
disintegration of national solidarity, and perpetuating national
independence and sovereignty.''
   Referring to foreign media comments urging an immediate transfer
of power, Gen. Saw Maung said ``It is not a trivial matter. We are
an independent nation and we are not subservient to any foreign
influence.
   ``We have done what we should do and every person with an
objective mind appreciates it. Except the insurgents, we have no
opposition,'' he said.
   It appeared to be strong warning against pressure for immediate
transfer of power.
   The opposition scored a huge victory over conservative,
pro-military forces in the May 27 vote. Tallies show the Parliament
will be overwhelmingly dominated by the junta's harshest critic,
the National League for Democracy.
   The military has promised to yield power after newly elected
legislators enact a constitution and form a civilian government.
But many are skeptical this promise will be kept.
   Gen. Saw Maung seized power last September, replacing the
26-year socialist system of army strongman Ne Win, who many believe
still holds behind-the-scenes power.
   The tense political scene in Burma is complicated by economic
malaise and insurgencies by groups demanding more autonomy.
Guerrillas of one of the groups, the Karen ethnic minority,
attacked a ferry in eastern Burma on Saturday and wounded 17
passengers, the state-owned Working People's Daily said Monday.
   The paper said 20 guerrillas attacked the double decker ferry on
the Salween River in Karen State, about 100 miles northeast of
Rangoon. They retreated when security personnel aboard the ferry
fired back, it said.
   The Karens have been fighting more than four decades. Rebel
sources say fighting has resumed in the northern part of Karen
State following a two-week lull that coincided with the May
election. The Karens have suffered heavy losses during intensified
government offensives in the past two years.

<HEAD>Rex Harrison Remembered as an Actor of `Charm, Elegance and Wit'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rex Harrison was recalled Monday as an actor of
``charm, elegance and wit'' at a memorial that combined an Anglican
church service, jazz interludes and recollections by colleagues and
Harrison's sons, Carey and Noel.
   The crowd that gathered for the ceremony at the Church of the
Transfiguration included such performers as Claudette Colbert,
Glynis Johns, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Kitty Carlisle Hart, Zoe
Caldwell, Eileen Atkins, Maggie Smith and Cliff Robertson.
   Harrison, who died June 2 at age 82 of pancreatic cancer, was
particularly remembered for portraying Henry Higgins in the stage
and film versions of ``My Fair Lady.'' The role won him both a Tony
and an Oscar.
   ``The craft of acting is a most secret, subtle and complicated
mystery and the art of comedy perhaps the most difficult and
mysterious quality to describe or define,'' said Miss Smith, now
appearing on Broadway in ``Lettice &amp; Lovage.'' ``But Rex Harrison
somehow managed in his long career to master the difficulty and to
understand the mystery.
   ``The charm was, of course, not always evident off-stage,'' she
added as the congregation laughed. ``He seldom suffered fools
gladly and his relationships with certain pompous directors and
many overbearing leading ladies were often stormy. He could be
exceedingly sharp. But to the general audience, whether in London
or New York, he was the total matinee idol.''
   Noel Harrison, the actor's older son, recalled some advice from
his father _ ``Don't cower. Charge.'' _ three words he says he
keeps in his heart as his father's epitaph.
   ``Striding _ that's how I remember him,'' Noel Harrison added.
``He loved to take walks. He didn't saunter. He strode, carrying
himself with style with his head held high, putting the world and
the elements to the test.''
   Carey Harrison spoke of his father's keen sense of himself _
faults and all.
   ``He never preached to anyone, least of all, to his sons,''
Carey Harrison said. ``He forced us _ and God bless him for it, it
was the only thing he forced on us _ to see him clearly as a man
and not blindly as a parent. And that's how he'd want us, his sons,
to talk about him _ as a man.''
   Brendan Gill, retired theater critic of The New Yorker, praised
Harrison's style on stage.
   ``He only had to step from the wings to seize our attention,''
Gill said. ``We leaned forward in our seats to hear the least
utterance of that quirky, enchanting voice. Even before he spoke,
his body language was, in effect, moving us.''
   Gill also apologized on behalf of the American Theater Wing for
not mentioning Harrison's death on the television broadcast of the
1990 Tony Awards. Harrison died the day before the awards ceremony.
   A remembrance by Jessica Tandy was planned, Gill said. ``But TV
is an ill-mannered medium at best'' and because the program ran 20
minutes over schedule, the television tribute was never done.

   An elderly Pennsylvania silk weaver from
Cambodia, a Hawaiian lei maker and a ``cowboy poet'' were among 13
folk artists honored by the government Monday for contributions to
their traditional arts.
   Bun Em, 71, a Cambodian refugee who uses leftover silk from a
Harrisburg, Pa., tie factory, was one of those honored by the
National Endowment for the Arts. The winners each receive a $5,000
National Heritage Grant and will have their work displayed at the
Capitol in the fall.
   There were 197 candidates for the NEA honors, many nominated by
state arts agencies.
   The NEA began the grants in 1982 to honor the nation's most
accomplished folk artists. The winners ``not only reflect the
diversity of our multi-cultural background, but also help to
preserve this richness for ours and generations to come,'' NEA
Chairman John E. Frohmayer said in a prepared statement.
   The other winners were Marie McDonald, a lei maker from Waimea,
Hawaii; Wallace McRae, a ``cowboy poet'' from Forsyth, Mont.;
Howard Armstrong, a string band musician from Detroit; Natividad

   The NEA said Bun Em brought her four daughters and two sons to
Pennsylvania in 1980. Speaking only halting English, she struggled
to assimilate until given a loom and weaving materials by friends
last year. That allowed her to continue a tradition that had
brought status to her family for years in her native land.
   In Cambodia, Bun Em used silk from cocoons. In Pennsylvania, she
uses silk left over from the men's tie factory and adds tapioca and
coconut oil to give her sarong skirts more luster.
   The loom ``made Bun Em truly happy for the first time in nine
years,'' according to a biography supplied by the NEA.

   Police may ask suspected drunken drivers most
routine questions and videotape their answers without warning them
of their rights, the Supreme Court ruled Monday.
   The 8-1 ruling in a Pennsylvania case means slurred responses to
questions about age, height and weight may be used to convict
motorists who have not been told they have a right to a lawyer and
to remain silent.
   But the court said police may not ask a suspect more difficult
questions _ for example, the date of the driver's sixth birthday _
without giving so-called Miranda warnings.
   Justice William J. Brennan, writing for the court, said
responses to questions about height, weight and similar
biographical data are ``admissible because the questions fall
within a routine booking question exception which exempts (them)
from Miranda's coverage.''
   The court ordered a state court to consider reinstating the
drunken-driving conviction of Inocencio Muniz.
   It was the second time in a week the court upheld police tactics
to fight drunken driving. The court ruled last week that sobriety
checkpoints don't violate motorists' rights.
   An Upper Allen Township, Pa., policeman noticed Muniz's car
stopped by the side of the road Nov. 30, 1986, with the motor
running.
   The officer said he smelled alcohol on Muniz's breath and that
the man's eyes were glazed and bloodshot. The officer said he told
Muniz not to drive until he was in a condition to operate the car
safely, but Muniz drove off as the officer returned to his patrol
car.
   The patrolman pursued Muniz, ordered him to stop and told him to
perform some sobriety tests. Muniz failed all the tests.
   The officer took Muniz to a police station where the motorist
was videotaped answering questions about his name, address, height,
weight, eye color, date of birth, age and date of his sixth
birthday.
   Only after those responses was Muniz given the Miranda warnings.
   Muniz, convicted previously of drunken driving, was convicted
again and sentenced to 45 days to 23 months in prison.
   The Supreme Court action Monday reversed a Pennsylvania appeals
court ruling that threw out the latter conviction in 1988.
   Brennan said permitting the judge who convicted Muniz to hear
his slurred responses did not violate Muniz's privilege against
self-incrimination. But Brennan said asking Muniz to state the date
of his sixth birthday falls into a different category.
   Muniz ``was left with the choice of incriminating himself by
admitting that he did not then know the date of his sixth birthday
or answering untruthfully by reporting a date that he did not
believe to be accurate,'' Brennan said.
   He said that unlike Muniz's responses to the other questions,
the suspect's answer to the sixth-birthday question was
incriminating because of its content, not just because of the
delivery.
   Four justices said they would permit the sixth-birthday question
as well. They are Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall dissented, voting to bar Muniz's
conviction.

   Hank Williams' long-lost daughter is
delighted the U.S. Supreme Court thinks she should have the chance
to fight in court for royalties from some of her late father's
country music hits.
   The high court, without comment, on Monday let stand a federal
appeals court ruling that Cathy Yvonne Stone, 37, is entitled to
have her legal fight put before a jury.
   ``I feel wonderful,'' Ms. Stone said in a telephone interview
from her Washington home. ``There's just not words. You really
can't express it.''
   The court also rejected an appeal by country singer Hank
Williams Jr. that sought to reverse an Alabama Supreme Court ruling
declaring Ms. Stone a legal heir to the elder Williams.
   ``I feel it's as big a victory for my father Hank Williams, as
myself,'' she said. ``This is what should have been done in the
beginning.''
   Named as defendants in Ms. Stone's royalties suit are the
younger Williams and other copyright owners.
   Ms. Stone was born in Alabama in 1953, five days after Williams
died at age 29. Her mother, Bobbie Jett, and Williams had signed an
agreement months earlier in which he acknowledged he might be the
father.
   Years went by without her knowing her lineage, but ultimately
she found out. Soon after marrying attorney Keith Adkinson in 1985,
she filed federal and state court lawsuits seeking a share of
Williams' songwriting royalties.

   Former racing champ and auto designer Carroll
Shelby was in fine tune Monday, less than two week after a pit stop
for a heart transplant, a hospital spokesman said.
   ``He's great,'' said Ron Wise, spokesman for Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center. ``He is making an outstanding recovery from his
heart transplant, or as I refer to it, his new engine.
   ``We've changed Carroll Shelby's engine and he's very happy with
it.''
   Shelby, who had been suffering from congestive heart failure for
about a year, got the transplanted heart June 8. Wise said he could
be released next week.
   Shelby, 67, lives on his ranch in Pittsburg, Texas, about 120
miles northeast of Dallas. He was a three-time U.S. Sports Car
Driver of the Year and designed of the famed Cobra muscle car.
   The American-built Cobras, the first affordable performance cars
at $6,000, led to the first and only U.S. victories at LeMans in
the mid-1960s.

   The crowd of 100,000 people who jammed
into the Riverbend Festival had to pay to see Bill Cosby, but
police Sgt. Brian Bergenback got paid for his time with the
down-to-earth TV comedian.
   Cosby took a limousine to the show Friday night, but told
Bergenback he wanted to ride in a patrol car on the trip back to
the Chattanooga airport.
   ``I thought he was kidding, but when he got back from
performing, he got in the car and said, `Let's go,' '' Bergenback
said.
   To avoid festival traffic and give Cosby some sightseeing,
Bergenback drove up Corridor J, a new highway that the comedian
called the last road in the United States without billboards.
   ``He also talked about how he thought Chattanooga was growing,''
Bergenback said. ``He said you can always tell how big a city is by
how many car dealerships you have in one place.''
   Bergenback said he and Cosby discussed ``normal things'' during
the celebrity delivery.
   ``And he talked about the last time he rode in a police car,''
the sergeant said. ``He said they caught a speeder doing 82.
Evidently he's done this before.''

   The bygone days of sock hops and
greasy kid stuff returned at a weekend nostalgia concert by Chubby
Checker and Paul Revere and the Raiders.
   Checker got the crowd swiveling with the invitation, ``Come on
baby, let's do the twist.'' A crowd of more than 4,000 joined in at
the Nebraskaland Days show on Saturday.
   Checker was just 17 when he recorded the song that started a
national dance craze in the 1960s. The singer, wearing
red-and-black checkerboard shoes, told the audience he was unhurt
in a concert tour bus accident in Oklahoma last week.
   ``The bus is totaled but we're still alive, thank God,'' he said.
   Revere and the Raiders wore tight white pants, knee-high silver
boots and Colonial-style jackets. Revere wore his traditional
three-cornered cap.
   Revere showed off a keyboard built into the grill of a Ford
Mustang with renditions of ``Indian Nation,'' ``Shake It Up'' and
``Louie Louie,'' one of the most covered songs of the era.
   ``I'm here to tell you we recorded it first,'' Revere said of
the song made famous by the Kingsmen, ``and I'm going to live long
enough to play it last.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Monday announced his
long-delayed selection of a new director for the Office of
Government Ethics, naming Washington D.C. lawyer Stephen D. Potts.
   Potts, 59, would succeed Frank Q. Nebeker, a holdover appointee.
   The ethics office reviews all personal financial filings of
federal officials and interprets laws and regulations relating to
conflicts of interest.
   During his presidential campaign, Bush vowed to enhance and
expand the powers of the office and to appoint a ``senior
counsellor to the president.''
   Even so, the post has remained under interim management through
the 17 months of Bush's presidency.
   His first choice for the job, Paul Pressler of Houston, a
fundamentalist religious leader, was withdrawn from consideration
after a routine FBI check uncovered what White House aides at the
time called an ``ethics problem.''
   Potts has been a partner with the law firm of Shaw, Pittman,
Potts and Trowbridge since 1961.
   A native of Memphis and graduate of Vanderbilt University, Potts
is a former vice president of the Cherokee Life Insurance Co. in
Nashville, Tenn.
   A White House fact sheet on Potts also notes that ``Mr. Potts
has won five national Father-Son Tennis Championships.''

   A leading congressional Democrat bluntly told the
nation's mayors Monday they stood no chance of getting billions _
or even millions _ more for urban programs from expected federal
defense savings.
   ``There's no money for such programs until the budget blockade
is broken,'' House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski told the U.S. Conference of Mayors. ``The peace
dividend is already going to be swallowed.''
   Rostenkowski's address to the more than 200 mayors quickly
dampened the spirits of a group that for three days had been making
the case that cities need a multibillion dollar infusion from the
federal government to fight drugs, poverty, housing, education and
other problems.
   Rostenkowski came home to Chicago to tell the mayors they would
be going it alone.
   ``Yours is not an easy task,'' the congressman said in a speech
blaming the Reagan administration for most festering urban
problems. He added that Congress, too, was far from ready to come
to the aid of mayors and that taxpayers were unlikely to support
higher taxes to help cities.
   ``He devastated everybody,'' said Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn.
   Later, the mayors heard a somewhat more encouraging talk from
Democratic Sen. Robert Kerrey of Nebraska. Still, even Kerrey said
peace dividend money will not ``fall like manna from heaven'' to
cities. Mayors' hopes rest on selling their ideas to voters, much
like Reagan sold his military buildup in the early 1980s, Kerrey
said.
   During the weekend, the mayors crafted an ambitious, costly
battle plan for attacking urban problems.
   The centerpiece of the plan was a demand that money from the
programs come from expected defense cuts, with the mayors seeking
half of whatever savings materialize. Rostenkowski's speech in
effect made much of the mayors' new lobbying agenda appear moot
even before it gets final approval Wednesday.
   Rostenkowski said he personally would support most of the
mayors' causes but decided in advance of the speech not to offer an
upbeat prognosis.
   ``Lying is not only dishonest it can also be politically
dangerous,'' he said. He closed his speech by saying, ``I'm going
to tell you the way it is. If you don't like it, too bad.''
   The mayors didn't like it.
   ``The cities are in desperate need,'' said Atlanta's Maynard
Jackson. ``I have heard your calls for strong leadership but what
we need are strong answers.''
   When Madison, Wis., Mayor Paul Songlin challenged Rostenkowski
and fellow Democrats to tell President Bush that Congress was
giving billions to cities and that money to bail out failing
savings and loans would have to be found elsewhere, the congressman
was characteristically blunt.
   ``We haven't got the votes,'' he said.
   Rostenkowski said he believed taxpayers would support new taxes
for the environment and perhaps for basic services. But he said
they were ``very suspicious'' about higher taxes to help cities and
their needy residents because of perceived abuses of past programs,
including those at the Reagan-era Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
   As for raising taxes to slash the deficit, Rostenkowski said
taxpayers ``get downright surly when we say we have to raise taxes
to pay for the past before we can even think about the future.''
   Still, he said some new taxes were inevitable, and likely to be
included in a deficit-cutting pact Congress is trying to negotiate
with the White House.
   ``We need to slash spending and raise taxes merely to reach
ground zero,'' Rostenkowski said. ``Until then we will be fiddling
at the margins.''
   Rostenkowski said housing, education and racial problems in the
nation's cities were greatly exacerbated because ``in the last
administration there was ignorance and indifference to America's
cities.''
   In Bush, Rostenkowski said cities have a president whose
rhetoric is full of support but whose programs are little different
from his predecessor.
   ``Unfortunately, will without wallet doesn't yield much of a
result,'' he said.
   Rostenkowski said he and other big-city Democrats in Congress
fail to win more federal support for cities because of powerful
rural lobbies that back huge farm subsidies _ ``even for
millionaires'' _ and rural health care.
   The result, he said, is cities get no help to combat drugs and
violence at the root of so many other urban problems.
   ``Political turf wars can be equally destructive, even if they
are less bloody,'' he said.

   Cable News Network plans live broadcasts of most
events during Nelson Mandela's visit to eight U.S. cities beginning
this week, but other networks will limit most coverage to regular
news programs.
   CNN spokesman John Bianchi said CNN would report live on the
South African black nationalist leader's visits to New York,
Boston, Washington, Atlanta, Miami, Detroit, Los Angeles and
Oakland, June 20-July 1. He said separate scheduled events
involving Winnie Mandela would be taped for showing on regular news
programs.
   Mandela is to be guest at a special ``Town Meeting'' to be taped
Thursday at City College of New York for broadcast that evening on
ABC, and also will appear on the network that night as a guest on
Ted Koppel's ``Nightline.'' ABC was undecided on further live
coverage as of Monday noon, according to spokesman Arnot Walker.
   CBS spokesman Tom Goodman said CBS would cover the Mandela visit
``if news warrants'' but planned no prior announcement.
   NBC planned regular coverage and was undecided whether to cover
live the African leader's scheduled address to a joint session of
Congress next week, said network spokeswoman Catherine McQuay. His
arrival in New York on Wednesday will be broadcast live on the NBC
``Today'' show, she said.
   Mandela is scheduled for two appearances Friday on PBS, a live
15-minute interview with co-host Robert MacNeil on ``The
MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour'' at 7 p.m. and an interview with Charlayne
Hunter-Gault, taped earlier that day for showing at 10 p.m.

   Fourteen scientists from the United States and
the Soviet Union will spend the summer camping in the backcountry
of Siberia to study climate changes, the Agriculture Department
said Monday.
   The joint team will then collect similar information in the
United States. Officials said the objective is to examine the
possible effects of climate change on forests.
   The project is sponsored by the department's Forest Service and
Moscow's State Forest Committee and organized by the Institute for
Resource Management, a non-profit environmental group founded by
actor Robert Redford.
   Field research will be coordinated by the University of
California at Santa Barbara under the direction of Daniel B. Botkin
and the Soviet Union's All-Union Scientific Research Center of the
State Forest Committee, directed by Anatoly Z. Shvidenko.
   Patricia Kearney, acting assistant secretary for natural
resources and environment, said in a statement that the venture is
``a unique opportunity to work cooperatively with the Soviet
Union'' toward improved management of natural resources.
   Kearney and Terrell Minger, president of the institute, are in
Moscow attending a climate change workshop to coordinate procedures
and plans for the project.
   The Soviet research sites are in Yakutsk, in eastern Siberia,
and in the Komi region in western Russia.
   After two months, the team will collect similar information at
U.S. sites in Caribou Creek, Alaska, appoximately 40 miles north of
Fairbanks, and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in the Superior
National Forest, Minnesota.
   The department did not name the U.S. scientists participating in
the joint research project.

   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi may be building
a second chemical weapons factory at a remote underground location
hundreds of miles south of Tripoli, Bush administration officials
disclosed Monday.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said in
interviews with The Associated Press that it's not clear whether
construction is complete.
   ``We're not sure until then'' what exactly the facility will be,
one official said.
   However, the officials declined to say how the activity that
points to work on a second plant was detected or to pinpoint the
exact location.
   Even so, the State Department publicly registered concern.
   ``It's dangerous for the entire region, and for the entire
world, you could say,'' said spokesman Richard Boucher.
   ``There are reports that Libya has already used a weapon of mass
destruction _ chemical weapons _ in combat and because of the
Gadhafi regime's support for terrorism,'' Boucher said.
   He referred to allegations that Libya used chemical weapons in
an invasion of Chad, a neighboring African country, several years
ago.
   U.S. intelligence, with assistance from such friendly countries
as France and Israel, keeps watch over Gadhafi's military
activities.
   ``We don't comment on intelligence matters generally,'' White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said when asked about a report in
Monday's Washington Times that Libya as building a second plant.
   ``On the other hand we are making an assessment. We just don't
have any conclusions to give,'' he said.
   The officials said Gadhafi's purpose in building a second plant
would be to divert some poison gas production from Rabta even
though the purported March fire at the factory, about 40 miles
south of Tripoli, evidently was a hoax.
   ``There was little damage, and we're still talking about the
possibility of a hoax,'' an official said. ``In fact, that's the
only possibility under consideration.''
   Fitzwater also said the Rabta fire apparently was a hoax _ and
also ``a pretty clear indication of intentions and willingness to
deceive the world in order to further their own intents on this
issue,''
   ``We're prepared to believe the worst,'' Fitzwater said.
   Gadhafi says the Rabta plant is a pharmaceutical production
factory. However, U.S. and West German officials have said it was
producing small amounts of chemical weapons and that Libya was on
the verge of bringing production up to full capacity.
   Boucher called Rabta a dangerous facility.
   ``We're very seriously concerned about it,'' he said. ``Were
reports of a second chemical weapons production facility to prove
true, our concern would be that much greater. Our position remains
that any chemical weapons facility in Libya must be dismantled.''
   Boucher said Rabta was still capable of producing chemical
weapons.
   ``We've spoken with many countries capable of supplying
manpower, expertise or equipment to a Libyan chemical weapons
facility,'' he said. ``We have urged them, of course, not to do so.
   Last week, West German businessman Jurgen Hippenstiel-Imhausen
confessed in a regional court in Mannheim that he was responsible
for secretly selling a chemical production plant to Libya for $150
million.
   Meanwhile, the Libyan news agency JANA, monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corp., quoted Gadhafi as urging scientists Sunday to
``work day and night'' to build a nuclear weapon ``in defiance of
America.''
   He also called for development of Libyan space technology.
   ``America manufactures missiles and puts above our heads
satellites,'' Gadhafi was quoted as saying. ``This provokes you and
ignites in you the spirit of defiance and revolution to reach space
and manufacture the atom.''
   He blamed the United States for withholding technology Libya
needs.
   Gadhafi also accused Israel of aiming nuclear weapons at Arab
cities.

<TEXT>
   The third defendant in the Bensonhurst racial
slaying played a key role in assembling the white mob that attacked
and killed a black teen-ager last summer, a prosector said Monday
in her opening argument.
   The 21-year-old defendant, John Vento, also heard Joseph Fama,
convicted of murder in the ase, say he was going to shoot one of
the blacks and knew Fama was carrying a pistol, Assistant District
Attorney Pamela Hayes told the jury.
   The attack, Ms. Hayes said, ``was to be a group project. One for
all and all for one.''
   Vento, she said, was as guilty of the killing as the trigger
man. ``John Vento was no mere follower,'' she said.
   Defense lawyer Gerald DiChiara maintained that Fama, who
prosecutors said was the triggerman, acted independently in
shooting Yusuf Hawkins in the chest. Vento was present and ready to
fight if necessary, DiChiara acknowledged, but neither hurt nor
threatened anyone.
   ``Nobody saw Joey Fama with a gun that night until it was too
late,'' the lawyer said. Fama, he said, acted alone and without
warning when he pulled an automatic pistol and shot the 16-year-old
Hawkins.
   ``Yusuf Hawkins was not kicked to death. Yusuf Hawkins was not
beaten to death. It was not a mob that caused Yusuf Hawkins to
die,'' DiChiara said.
   DiChiara also cited the deal Vento struck with prosecutors after
fleeing New York following the Aug. 23 slaying. In September, Vento
called prosecutors and said he had taken part in the attack in
Brooklyn's Bensonhurst section.
   In exchange for immunity from prosecution, Vento agreed to
testify before a grand jury and said he would take the stand
against his friends. But around Christmas, Vento again fled New
York.
   ``If he was this evil kid they just described in their opening
statement, do you think they would have considered that deal?''
DiChiara asked of the pact Vento made with prosecutors in the weeks
after the slaying.
   In March, Vento surrendered to federal law enforcers in Ohio,
but said he would no longer honor his agreement to cooperate. He
was indicted by a grand jury.
   He was charged with two counts of second-degree murder, riot,
assault, unlawful imprisonment, menacing, aggravated harassment,
discrimination and criminal possession of a weapon, and is being
held without bail.
   Vento faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted of murder.
   Fama was convicted May 17 of murdering Hawkins. The following
day, co-defendant Keith Mondello was acquitted of murder and
manslaughter charges, but was found guilty of several lesser crimes.
   Both 19-year-olds were given the maximum sentences _ 32 and
two-third years to life for Fama, and five and one-third to 16
years in prison for Mondello.

   Militant Kashmiris declared a

   The move complicates already tense relations between the two
countries. Their governments agreed Monday to talks aimed at easing

   Amanullah Khan, chairman of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front,
announced the government-in-exile at a news conference in

spokesman Raja Muzzafar.
   Khan's organization wants the former princely state of Kashmir,
now split between India and Pakistan, to be reunited and granted
independence. Clashes during the 6-month-old uprising, mostly in
India, have left more than 550 people dead.
   Monday's announcement by the secessionists came shortly before
India formally agreed to high-level talks with Pakistan to defuse
tension along their common border.
   Indian officials said delegates from the two nations will meet
early next month but a date and site has not been set.
   In Islamabad, Pakistan's foreign secretary, Tanvir Ahmed Khan,
confirmed the proposed meeting. ``I think this is a welcome
development,'' he said. ``This could be a good beginning.''
   India and Pakistan both claim Kashmir, a predominately Moslem
state that joined mainly Hindu India when Britain partitioned the
subcontinent along religious lines in 1947.
   India and Pakistan fought wars over Kashmir in 1948 and 1965.
The territory is now divided by a cease-fire line, and the armies
of both countries have massed troops and artillery along the border.
   India accuses Pakistan of arming and training Moslem Kashmiri
militants who are fighting for independence from India.
   Pakistan denies the charges but supports the uprising on the
Indian side of the cease-fire line, calling it a movement for
self-determination.
   An Indian official said the new government-in-exile could
endanger the planned talks.
   ``It is certainly not going to help Pakistan or ... relations,
and I hope it has not derailed this process of opening talks,''
said one senior official at the Indian High Commission, the embassy
in Islamabad. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Militant members of Khan's group have warned the uprising could
spill into Pakistan if it refuses demands for independence.
   But Tanvir Ahmed Khan, Pakistan's foreign secretary, rejected
Khan's government and the group's demands for independence.
   Pakistan has instead called for a plebiscite that would allow
Kashmiris to decide whether to join Pakistan or India. ``There was
no question of a third choice,'' Ahmed Khan said Monday.
   Muzzaffar refused to identify the headquarters of his new
government.
   The Indian embassy official warned that peace talks with
Pakistan would be ``very difficult'' if Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto's government allows Khan's provisional government to
establish its headquarters in Pakistan.
   The newly elected president of Pakistan-controlled Azad (Free)
Kashmir, Sultan Mahmood, also rejected Khan's government.
   ``There is already a government; there is no need for his,''
Mahmood said. ``I don't think of myself as only the president of
Azad Kashmir, but also of Indian-occupied Kashmir.''
   Most of India's 880 million people are Hindus. Kashmir is the
country's only Moslem majority state.

<HEAD>Tilt-Rotor V-22 Osprey Makes Emergency Landing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An experimental tilt-rotor aircraft
designed to hover like a helicopter and fly like an airplane made
an emergency landing Monday after one of two engines failed, a
spokesman said.
   The V-22 Osprey lost power in its left engine, but was able to
return safely to Arlington Municipal Airport, said Terry Arnold,
spokesman for Bell Helicopter Textron Inc.
   No injuries or damage to the prototype aircraft were reported
after the 10 a.m. malfunction in the skies about 40 miles southwest
of downtown Dallas, Arnold said.
   ``Actually, we're pleased, because the aircraft did what it was
supposed to do,'' Arnold said. ``The other engine engaged the shaft
and drove both rotor systems and we landed without incident. It was
designed to do just that.''
   Arnold said it was the first emergency landing on record for the
V-22. The cause of the malfunction was not immediately known.
   The Osprey can hover and land like a helicopter but also flies
at up to 340 mph as a fixed-wing airplane _ much faster than a
helicopter. Large rotors on the ends of the wings tilt up for
vertical flight and rotate forward for the long haul.
   Arnold said the aircraft, one of four Osprey prototypes, was in
``airplane mode'' when the engine failed.
   It flew in ``airplane mode'' back to the airport, where it
swooped down and landed like a helicopter, said Bob Leder, another
Bell Helicopter Textron spokesman.
   The four prototypes are among six Ospreys for which the Pentagon
has contracted.
   The Defense Department has spent $2 billion to develop the V-22
Osprey and its predecessor, the XV-15, for military use. But
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney wants to end funding in favor of
conventional helicopter development.

   John S. Niederhauser, dubbed ``Mr.
Potato'' for his work developing a blight-resistant strain of
spuds, won the $200,000 World Food Prize on Monday.
   Niederhauser's work increased potato harvests and helped prevent
famine in developing nations, said Norman Borlaug, founder of the
prize.
   ``His achievements toward developing a blight-resistant potato
variety have affected countries from Mexico to Bangladesh,''
Borlaug said. ``Without a doubt, Dr. Niederhauser's discoveries
have had a dramatic impact on the food-deficient regions of the
world.''
   The World Food Prize rewards research in production or
distribution of food. Niederhauser is the fourth recipient.
   Niederhauser worked for a private agricultural research
foundation in Mexico and by 1982 was working with a similar group
in Poland.
   He developed a strain of potato resistant to late blight
disease, the disease blamed for the great potato famine that
devastated Ireland and other European countries about a century ago.
   Niederhauser also works as a consultant for Biosphere II, a
research program developing a sealed food production environment
that could be self-sustaining.
   ``The challenge is enormous,'' Niederhauser said. ``By 2010, if
there is a trip to Mars, the crew, using some of the technology
developed in the Biosphere II, could produce their own food en
route and eliminate one of the major limiting factors of such a
trip.''
   Borlaug won the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize for his research
fostering the ``green revolution'' in developing nations. The World
Food Prize is funded by private donors.

   Northwest Airlines is investigating a
``paperwork mix-up'' that led to the accidental cremation of the
body of a California newspaper executive.
   A spokesman for the airline said Sunday that the mix-up took
place at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport after a plane
arrived from California carrying John P. Brownell's body and the
body of a South Dakotan.
   Brownell, 33, was a deputy managing editor of the Los Angeles
Times. He was a native of Minnesota.
   His body had been scheduled to be put on a flight to Rochester,
en route to his home town of St. Charles. But the South Dakotan's
body was sent instead, and Brownell's body was taken to a crematory
in Mound, just outside Minneapolis.
   ``It was a paperwork mix-up,'' Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons
said. He added that the airline is trying to find out exactly what
went wrong.
   Brownell's family learned last Wednesday that he had been
cremated. Funeral services were held as scheduled the next day in
St. Charles.
   Brownell's father, Melvin, said a Northwest Airlines
representative called him and said the airline ``knew what had
occurred, but didn't know how it had occurred.''
   The family will continue to look into the incident, he said.
   Brownell, who died of AIDS complications June 9 at a hospital in
Sherman Oaks, Calif., was the youngest journalist to become a top
news executive at the Times.

<TEXT>
   A panel of 18 people was chosen Monday to
weigh the cocaine and perjury charges against Mayor Marion Barry,
including one who opposes police undercover operations.
   Another says she believes race may have played a role in Barry's
prosecution. A third says she's reluctant to judge a fellow human
being.
   Twelve of the 18 will be designated as jurors when deliberations
begin. The other six will be dismissed.
   The panel will be sworn in Tuesday, then hear opening statements.
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered the 18
_ picked from 81 District of Columbia residents _ to be sequestered
for the duration of the trial.
   Jackson did not say why he would wait to announce which six of
the 18 are alternates.
   Barry, who announced last week that he wouldn't seek
re-election, sat facing the jury box during Monday's hour-long
court session.
   The panel includes 13 blacks and five whites. Under court rules,
the prosecution was permitted to dismiss a maximum of nine
prospective jurors, the defense 13. The prosecution dismissed
seven, all of them black. The defense dismissed a dozen, 10 of them
white.
   Barry, 54, is black, and a number of prospective jurors
questioned over the last two weeks said they thought race and
politics had played a role in the investigation and prosecution of
the three-term mayor.
   Many of the 18 expressed reluctance to be jurors and said they
already have formed opinions about the investigation and
prosecution of Barry. But all said, in questioning as prospective
jurors, that they would set aside their personal views if called to
deliberate the mayor's fate.
   One member of the panel, Harriedell Jones, said she regards the
undercover operation against Barry as unfair and added that she
felt race had played a role in the case.
   ``If his race was different, they would go about'' investigating
and prosecuting Barry ``differently,'' she said.
   Barry was arrested at a hotel in January after the FBI
videotaped him allegedly smoking crack cocaine. Barry had been
persuaded to come to the room by ex-model Rasheeda Moore, who was
cooperating with the government.
   Another prospective juror, Marsena Hall, said during questioning
that ``I don't want to be put'' in a situation of having to sit in
judgment of Barry or anyone else.
   ``I really don't feel like I can'' judge a fellow human being,
Hall said when questioned by assistant U.S. attorney Judith
Retchin. She told R. Kenneth Mundy, Barry's lawyer, that she could
be fair and impartial regarding the evidence in the mayor's case.
   Another panel member, Joyce Hines, said ``I think anything done
undercover is wrong.
   ``I think everything should be done out in the open,'' Hines
said at one point in her questioning as a prospective juror.
   But Hines said she would follow the court's instructions. The
judge will instruct the panel that the FBI sting operation was
legal.
   Another prospective juror, Valerie Jackson-Warren, called
undercover operations ``a little sneaky'' and said the ``sting''
against Barry was unfair.
   The FBI videotape is the heart of the government's case. Barry
is charged with 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine possession, one
misdemeanor count of conspiracy and three felony counts of lying to
a federal grand jury about his alleged involvement with drugs.
   Jones expressed an opinion about Barry's grand jury testimony.
   ``I think he might'' have lied to the grand jury, she said.
   The panel members include a high school history teacher, a
courier for a local messenger service, an unemployed school
crossing guard and an accounting assistant at the U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development.

<TEXT>
   The government proposed Monday to give
gay couples many of the same rights as married people in areas such
as taxation, inheritance and divorce.
   If the proposal is passed by parliament, Sweden will be the
second country after Denmark to introduce a kind of marriage for
homosexuals. No U.S. state has such a law.
   In Sweden, the legal union for male and female homosexuals would
be called ``partnership.'' It would include the same rules on
taxation, inheritance, divorce and taking a spouse's last name as
for married heterosexual couples.
   However, it would not let gay couples adopt children.
   Swedish television said that if passed, the measure would take
effect next year.
   ``We will be the second country in the world that in this way
not only legalizes that homosexuals live together, but also gives
the society's blessing through registration and in the form of
legal rights,'' said Carl-Anders Ifvarsson, a director at the
National Health Board. His agency presented the proposal.

   An environmental group called on the Bush
administration Monday to participate in an international effort to
phase out a commonly used chemical that is depleting the ozone
layer.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council also urged consumers to
avoid buying 141 products, ranging from artists' varnishes to
hornet-killing sprays, that contain the chemical
1,1,1-trichloroethane.
   Chloroflourocarbons, or CFCs, have been singled out as the most
potent ozone-destroying substances. But the council said 1,1,1, as
it is known for short, is responsible for a large share of ozone
depletion because it is produced in such large quantities.
   Approximately 724 million pounds of 1,1,1 were produced in 1988
by DOW Chemical, PPG Industries, and Vulcan Chemical, according to
the NRDC.
   The group said 90 percent of the chemical is used in industrial
solvents. Consumer goods that contain it include Scotchgard fabric
protectors manufactured by 3M Products of St. Paul.
   ``For most applications, there are alternative products on the
market that serve the same purpose'' both in industry and
individual homes, the NRDC said.
   Representatives of 70 nations will open a 10-day meeting in
London on Wednesday to consider revisions to an international
agreement that freezes production and consumption of CFCs at their
1986 level. The pact, known as the Montreal Protocol, also calls
for a 50 percent reduction in CFCs by 1998.
   ``The most difficult decisions remaining relate to
1,1,1-trichloroethane,'' said David D. Doniger, director of the
NRDC's ozone protection project. He said options under
consideration range from a 25 percent rollback to a complete
phase-out in the next 10 years.
   Doniger said Japan, the United States and the European Community
are balking at going further than 50 percent. But he said that
would not be sufficient to prevent serious damage to the ozone
layer.
   ``So we call on the nations represented in London _ and
particularly on the United States _ to do all that is needed to
protect the ozone layer,'' the NRDC attorney said. ``Let's not
settle for another treaty that goes only part way.''
   Thomas Snead, special assistant for public affairs in the State
Department's office of environmental affairs, said he was not able
to say what the U.S. proposal would be because it was ``part of the
negotiating position.''
   ``Evidently it will be one of the things that they will be
discussing at the meetings of the parties,'' Snead said.
   The NRDC and other environmental groups have argued that
man-made chemicals are stripping away the Earth's ozone layer,
permitting more of the sun's ultraviolet rays to slip through and
increasing the danger of cancer and environmental damage.
   Rick Renner, a spokesman for 3M, said the company is working on
replacements for 1,1,1.
   ``I have to say that this is not easy,'' Renner said. ``At this
point, the available substitutes tend to be flammable, contribute
to global warming and contribute to smog and are toxic, and we are
not using them.''
   Four varnishes and fixatives marketed by M. Grumbacher Inc., a
Cranbury, N.J.-based art supply firm, were on the NRDC list of
consumer products containing 1,1,1.
   Godfrey Chambers, technical services manager for Grumbacher,
said the four products _ Damar varnish, Myston, Retouch varnish and
Tuffilm fixative - are manufactured by a supplier and purchased by
Grumbacher for resale.
   ``The person we purchase it from is continuing research in this
matter to try and eliminate it,'' Chambers said. He said the
company has already removed 1,1,1 from some of its other aerosols.

   A Soviet pilot landed a passenger plane on
a beach on Turkey's Black Sea coast Monday and asked for political
asylum. Officials quoted him as saying he wanted to flee the
``undemocratic regime'' in Moscow.
   A government announcement said the pilot was alone in the
Antonov-2 plane when it landed near Kumcagiz, a village in Kocaeli
province.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said the 12-seat plane was
seized in Izmail, near the Ukrainian port of Odessa. The report
offered few details.
   The Turkish statement identified the pilot as Valeri Yuricevic.
   Kocaeli Gov. Ihsan Dede said Yuricevic was married and had a
child. He said the pilot recently separated from his wife.
   Tass said the pilot resigned several months ago from his job
with an Odessa air crew.
   Officials quoted Yuricevic as saying during an interrogation
that he escaped ``the undemocratic regime'' in his country and
wanted to live in Turkey.
   Dede told The Associated Press that Yuricevic, 29, complained
about harsh living conditions in the Soviet Union, where shortages
are widespread and economic problems continue. He said the pilot
did not elaborate.
   Dede said Yuricevic's request for political asylum was being
examined.
   State TV showed the plane near the coastline. A village girl
interviewed on television said residents watched the plane land.
She said the pilot approached her after he got out of the plane and
spoke to her in Russian.
   Another villager said the pilot was shaking and looked nervous.
   Villagers brought the pilot to the police station, Dede said.
The plane, flying at low altitude, made the trip in two hours.
   Turkey's announcement said the plane was tracked immediately
after it entered Turkish airspace and military planes were put on
alert.
   However, the plane was allowed to land safely when authorities
determined it posed no threat. There are no airports in the
province.
   A government official, who requested anoynmity, said the Soviets
immediately asked Turkey to return the plane and the pilot.
   Dede said local officials were waiting for a team of technical
experts to move the plane, which sunk into the sand on the beach.
   When a Soviet air force captain defected to this country in a
MIG-29 jet a year ago, Turkey allowed the plane to be flown back to
the Soviet Union but sent the pilot to the United States upon his
request.

<TEXT>
   Volunteers gathered on a beach Monday
to begin searching for a wave of tar balls expected to come ashore
this week from the wrecked super tanker Mega Borg. A Mexican vessel
continued to skim oil off the Gulf of Mexico.
   Although hundreds of volunteers were expected, only about 60
showed up Monday morning at Sea Rim State Park between High Island
and Sabine Pass for the first beach sweep.
   They walked the sandy shoreline picking up seaweed, trash and
tar balls from smaller oil spills to make it easier to clean up any
oil from the Norweigan-owned tanker. Small amounts of tar
frequently wash up on the beach here.
   ``They said they needed volunteers and I said, `Does that mean
me?' And I said, `Why not me?''' said Jo Krose, who drove two hours
from Kirbyville to participate in the beach cleanup.
   ```They need some help and nobody's depending on me today, so I
came down,'' she said.
   State officials expect several hundred more volunteers to help
in the cleanup this week, said Andy Mangan, deputy Texas land
commissioner.
   Tar balls are predicted to begin washing ashore on Tuesday
somewhere along a 45-mile stretch northeast of Galveston. The area
predicted to be hit is between High Island and Sabine Pass, a town
near the Texas-Louisiana line.
   The 30-mile oil slick was about seven miles offshore Monday and
had been moving about two miles a day, the Coast Guard said.
   Officials hoped the oil would hit the sandy beaches rather than
the marshes, where wildlife refuges are located. Sandy beaches are
easier to clean.
   ``The major part of the toxicity has gone (dissipated from the
oil),'' said Sharon Christopherson of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Adminstration. ``The longer it stays out there, the
less oil you'll see come ashore.''
   Although Coast Guard officials said most of the 3.9 million
gallons of oil that has leaked from the vessel has either burned
off or been collected, they conceded they were not sure how much
remained on the water.
   ``It's really hard. I keep telling you 12,000 to 40,000 gallons
and now we've picked up 250,000, and my credibility is waning
here,'' said Coast Guard Capt. Thomas Greene.
   He said 250,000 gallons had been collected d3of Sunday, but the
figure is rising.
   A 200-foot-long skimming vessel owned by Pemex, the national oil
company of Mexico, was being used to suck oil off the water.
   The vessel was first used Sunday to suck about 63,000 gallons of
mostly oil and water from the Gulf. About 12 skimmers have been
used during the past week to get more oil off the water.
   The Mexican vessel works by opening its front end, sucking up
the oil and water and filtering it so the oil can be reused. This
is the first time it has been used on open waters, said Armando
Espinola, a vice admiral with the Mexican Navy.
   The vessel can suction up to 1,000 gallons an hour.
   ``It exceeded my expectations,'' Greene said. ``I had no idea
what it could do.''
   Professional cleanup crews also laid booms Monday to help
protect the shore from oil that leaked from the tanker, now
crippled some 57 miles off Galveston.
   Salvage crews also continued to pump water from the five-ravaged
pump and engine rooms and a cargo tank that spilled the oil. They
also poured more firefighting foam on the cargo tank to keep it
from reigniting.
   Coast Guard Cmdr. Michael Slack said crews plan to begin
transferring oil from the tanker to a smaller vessel on Tuesday.
   The 886-foot Mega Borg was carrying 38 million gallons of light
Angolan crude oil when it was rocked by an explosion June 8. Two
crew members died and two are missing and presumed dead.

<HEAD>Bulgaria Elects Parliament Dominated by ex-Communists</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bulgaria on Monday became the first East
European nation to freely elect a Parliament dominated by the
former Communist Party, opting for a slow changeover to a market
economy.
   While Bulgaria's first free elections in 58 years ends the
Communists' rubber-stamp domination of politics, it also ensures a
sizeable opposition with enough votes to veto constitutional
proposals.
   ``We will resolutely ... move in the direction of a democratic
European leftist party,'' Premier Andrei Lukanov said, expressing
confidence he could form a government of consensus.
   But the leader of the main opposition alliance rejected any deal
with the former Communists.
   According to official results of Sunday's runoff elections, the
ruling Socialist Party, which until April was the Communist Party,
clinched an absolute majority with 211 seats in the 400-seat
Parliament.
   The main opposition Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), a 16-party
alliance, captured 144 seats, the ethnic Turkish Rights and
Freedoms Movement won 23 seats, and the mainstream Agrarian Party
16. Smaller parties and independents won six seats.
   The capital Sofia, going against the nationwide trend, voted
overwhelmingly for the opposition, electing UDF candidates for 24
of 26 available seats.
   Analysts say the Socialists represent stability for many who
feared the loss of jobs and social upheaval in a quick switch to
private ownership favored by the UDF. The Socialists favor leaving
some industry state-run for now.
   Bulgaria has a nearly century-old Communist tradition, more
deeply rooted than elsewhere in Eastern Europe, and the current
Socialist leadership scored points for ousting hard-liner Todor
Zhivkov in November and initiating gradual reforms.
   The Socialist leaders were also seen as more charismatic and
their campaign more professional than the seven-month-old UDF.
   Apart from Bulgaria, non-Communist parties have triumphed in
this year's round of national elections in East Germany,
Czechoslovakia and Hungary following last year's regional
revolutions. In Romania, the National Salvation Front that won a
landslide victory includes many ex-Communists.
   The new government must tackle the country's $10 billion foreign
debt, rising inflation and shortages of basic goods. The newly
elected unicameral Grand National Assembly must also write a
constitution, which requires two-thirds approval for adoption.
   Victorious Socialist Party leaders, many carrying red
carnations, were applauded and kissed by cheering supporters.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Lukanov reiterated
his refusal to head a Cabinet composed only of members of his own
Socialist party.
   He welcomed remarks made by UDF chairman Zhelyu Zhelev about the
possibility of what Lukanov described as ``a government of
responsible and competent personalities.''
   ``This does not mean I accept his idea. I note with great
interest his recognition that a government ... if it is to be
successful has to be supported by all political forces,'' Lukanov
declared.
   But Zhelev told The AP the UDF would not be part of a Socialist
government though another senior UDF official, Petar Beron, said a
government of experts remained a possible consideration.
   The UDF Coordinating Council, the alliance's executive organ,
was scheduled to meet Tuesday to hammer out a joint stand, and
informed sources said heated discussions were expected.
   Zhelev described the outcome of the elections ``means we are a
strong constructive opposition, and the BSP (Socialists) will be a
weak one-party government.''
   He said the idea of a government of non-political professionals
was made when there was a real likelihood of a hung Parliament.
   ``In such a situation, as is usual in theory and practice in the
world, they have to form their own government,'' Zhelev explained.
``If they don't like that, they can form a government of experts of
their own, but we will not be part of it.''
   Lukanov, 51, a multilingual economics expert, suggested a split
in his party _ possibly at a new party congress this fall _ and in
the UDF could change Bulgaria's political landscape and ensure
ultimate stability.
   ``The present distribution of forces is rather artificial,'' the
premier noted. ``It hides the diversity of views, nuances,
ideologies ...''
   The Socialists gained 172 seats in first-round voting June 10
and needed to capture only 29 of the 81 seats at stake in Sunday's
runoff to win a majority.
   According to the official results released by the Central
Electoral Commission, the Socialists won 39 and the UDF won 37. The
remainder went to independents and smaller parties.
   State television reported some voting irregularities in the
runoff. Dimiter Ivanov, an activist from the Association of Fair
Elections, said in some cases the number of people voting exceeded
the number of people registered in the respective precincts.

   Severe thunderstorms rattled parts of the Northeast on Monday,
with severe wind damage reported in upstate New York and heavy
rains, flooding and hail reported in northern Pennsyvlania.
   Elsewhere in the nation, unseasonably hot weather baked the
lower middle South.
   An elderly West Point, Neb., man was found dead Monday, killed
in floods that continued to plague northeast Nebraska.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended by noon over western Maine,
across western New England, much of the southeast half of New York
state, and northeast through north-central and central Pennsylvania.
   A woman in Brownville, N.Y., was injured when
thunderstorm-spawned winds overturned her mobile home. The
fast-moving storms left fires, blackouts and houses crushed by
toppled trees in their wake.
   Mayor Charles Brennan declared a state of emergency after
falling trees crushed houses and blocked streets in Brownville, a
village about 60 miles north of Syracuse.
   Firefighters were treated for minor injuries after battling a
lightning-caused fire at a chemical plant in the Buffalo suburb of
Tonawanda.
   In Buffalo, Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. reported power knocked
out for about 35,000 customers in the region, but said most service
had been restored by afternoon.
   Thunderstorm wind gusts also caused damage over northeast
Pennsylvania. Winds gusted to 52 mph at Erie and }-inch hail fell
at Foster Brook and near Coudersport.
   There was flooding from heavy rain at Bradford and Lobanton,
Pa., where 3 inches of rain fell in one hour.
   Morning thunderstorms also produced golf ball-size hail in and
around Sand Springs, Okla.
   Showers and storms reached from southeastern West Virginia into
northwestern Virginia, as well as in central Florida, southwest
Georgia, northern Alabama, southern Tennessee, east-central
Mississippi, the lower Texas Gulf Coast, and northeast Nevada.
   The heat was on for the southern Plains, parts of the lower
Mississippi Valley, Mississippi and western Tennessee, where
afternoon highs were expected to reach 115 degrees through Tuesday
afternoon.
   The low temperature for the Lower 48 states was 31 degrees at
Truckee, Calif. At 3 p.m. EDT, temperatures around the nation
ranged from 48 degrees at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., to 104 degrees
at Tucson, Ariz.

<HEAD>Pentagon Disputes Newsweek Report on Panama Deaths</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two U.S. soldiers, possibly three, were
accidentally killed by their comrades during the Panama invasion,
the Pentagon said Monday in disputing a Newsweek report that nine
were killed that way.
   The Defense Department also disputed the magazine's contention
that as many as 60 percent of the more than 300 U.S. soldiers
wounded in the Dec. 20 invasion were hit by so-called ``friendly
fire.''
   ``Of the 324 American servicemen wounded in action during
Operation Just Cause, 19 were definitely the result of friendly
fire,'' said the statement.
   The statement added that an additional 21 soldiers were injured
during intense fighting in the vincinity of the Commandancia, the
headquarters of Gen. Manuel Noriega's headquarters, ``by either
friendly or enemy fire.''
   ``We cannot distinguish which of the 21 were hit by friendly or
enemy fire,'' the Pentagon statement said.
   If all 21 in the uncertain category were hit by friendly fire,
the total of 40 wounded that way would be 12 percent of the wounded.
   The statement said that the two soldiers killed as a result of
friendly fire died during the battle at Rio Hato, where U.S.
Rangers were dropped as part of Task Force Red southwest of Panama
City.
   ``In the case of one additional serviceman killed in action, it
has not been determined if his death was a direct result of
friendly or enemy fire. The circumstances of his death are under
investigation,'' the statement said.
   The other 20 servicemen who were killed died as a result of
enemy fire, said Pentagon spokeswoman Maj. Kathy Wood.
   The statement amounted to one of the most detailed reports on
the deaths of U.S. servicemen that has been issued in the six
months since the invasion.
   Normally, very detailed ``after action'' reports are compiled in
the wake of any military action, but they are usually very closely
held.
   In its statement, the Pentagon said it ``has been investigating
every report of injury to U.S. personnel caused by friendly fire
during Operation Just Cause.''
   Pentagon sources, who spoke on condition of not being identified
by name, said confusion over the deaths could have arisen because
Noriega's troops used U.S.-supplied bullets and weapons.
   Given the sensitivity of the issue, the response to the Newsweek
report was approved by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and Gen.
Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, before
being released to reporters, the sources said.
   The Newsweek report, published in the issued dated June 25,
quoted unidentified military officials as the source of its
information.

<HEAD>Bush Spokesman: Administration Encouraged on Lithuania</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds 5 grafs at end with Senate action on Baltics</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration said Monday it was
heartened by recent conciliatory gestures by the Kremlin toward
Lithuania but cautioned that ``there's still much more to be done.''
   ``We're encouraged that both sides have taken some steps to try
to solve the problem, that a dialogue has taken place,'' said White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Legislators in Vilnius, the capital of the rebellious Baltic
republic, were to vote this week on a plan to break the deadlock
with Moscow.
   Last week, Lithuanian Prime Minister Vytautas Landsbergis met
with Soviet Leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to discuss the impasse.
After the meeting, Moscow restored some natural gas supplies to
Lithuania.
   ``We're encouraged that there's been some lifting of the
economic embargo,'' Fitzwater said. ``But it is still in the
first-steps category. There's still much more to be done, and we
wouldn't want to jump to a conclusion in terms of how it's going to
end up yet.''
   Meanwhile, 23 senators urged Bush to consider taking steps to
normalize economic relations with Lithuania and the other renegade
Baltic republics.
   ``We believe that such actions would enhance our 50-year policy
of supporting independence for the people of Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia,'' the senators wrote Monday in a letter to Bush.
   Signers included Sens. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the
Senate Appropriations Committee, and Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the
ranking GOP member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   Earlier in the day, the Senate reiterated its views on the
U.S.-Soviet trade agreement that was signed earlier this month
during the superpower summit.
   Senators voted 74-24 for a resolution asking Bush not to approve
the pact until the Soviet Union lifts its economic embargo on
Lithuania. ``We again urge you not to send the trade agreement to
the Congress until these conditions are met,'' the resolution said.

   Jofi Joseph of Muskegon, Mich., won the fifth
annual Citizen Bee on Monday after correctly outlining the
constitutional provision governing letters of marque and reprisal.
   Joseph, who graduated this month from Muskegon Catholic High
School, plans to enroll this fall at Georgetown University in
Washington, where he will attend the school of foreign service.
   He received a $7,000 scholarship as first prize in the contest,
sponsored by the Close Up Foundation in cooperation with the
Smithsonian Institution's Office of Elementary and Secondary
Education.
   Close Up is a nonprofit organization that provides educational
programs on government and citizenship.
   Second prize, which carries a scholarship of $5,000, went to
Derek Baxter, who will be a senior in the fall at W.T. Woodson High
School in Fairfax, Va.
   Gautam Dutta, a graduate of Cistercian Prep in Irving, Texas,
who plans to go to Yale, won third prize, with a $3,000 scholarship.
   Joseph had a final score of 143 points, based on written and
oral answers. Baxter had a score of 136 and Dutta of 133.
   The final question to Joseph, which was good for 12 points, was
to define letters of marque and reprisal and say what branch of
government the Constitution empowered to grant them.
   The Constitution empowered Congress to grant such letters,
authorizing private ships to attack enemy vessels in wartime.
   Joseph also answered correctly that Puerto Ricans became
American citizens under the Jones Act, passed in 1917 when Woodrow
Wilson was president, and that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
visited Minnesota to encourage people to invest in the Soviet Union.
   He slipped up when asked what states, other than Wyoming and
Illinois, you would pass through if you traveled in a straight line
from Cheyenne, Wyo., to Chicago. He said Colorado and Iowa. The
correct answer is Nebraska and Iowa. Joseph answered correctly that
the river you would cross is the Mississippi.

   Rifle shots rang out along the back nine
of a golf course, sending about 100 golfers scrambling for cover,
but police don't think the shooter was after people.
   ``It appears someone was shooting at targets or birds or
squirrels or something and the shots went over into the golf
course,'' Camillus Police Sgt. Lloyd Perkins said Monday. ``We do
not believe it was a sniper.''
   Dave Rustay and his friends were teeing off on the Westvale Golf

   ``We thought he said, `Nice shot,''' recounted Rustay, 26.
   ``But he was really saying they were shooting at us. We didn't
really know what was going on. That's why it was so frightening.''
   An estimated 20 shots were fired.
   Rustay and his friends took cover, then raced to a nearby pro
shop to summon help.

<HEAD>Safety Board Urges More Action Against Windshear Danger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board said
Monday that federal authorities aren't doing enough to protect
airliners from dangerous winds during takeoff and landing at major
airports.
   The board, which has no regulatory power, recommended that the
Federal Aviation Administration buy additional ground-based
equipment to warn planes of sudden changes of wind speed and
direction known as windshear.
   At least eight passenger plane accidents in the last 17 years
have been blamed at least in part on wind hazards.
   The four-member board noted that the FAA has taken several steps
to protect airplanes against windshear, including future required
installation of detection equipment aboard airliners.
   ``However, the board believes that additional actions are
required by the FAA for maximum protection against this hazard in
the national airspace system,'' said a board announcement.
   Board recommendations were outlined in a 11-page letter to FAA
Administrator James Busey.
   The board called for appointment of an FAA meteorologist at
major airports and purchase of sophisticated weather radar systems
at all airports determined to be susceptible to low-altitude
windshear conditions.
   The invisible hazard, which occurs under thunderstorms or in
connection with weather fronts, is considered most dangerous near
the ground at airports where it can affect planes during takeoff or
landing.
   The board also called for interim improvements at airports where
installation of windshear detection equipment might take some time
to install or where the weather radar systems aren't planned.
   The board said its recommendations were based on a review of
more than 40 safety recommendations it has issued to the FAA over
the past 16 years.
   The safety board, which operates independently from the FAA or
the Transportation Department, investigates accidents and regularly
makes recommendations for safety improvements in transportation
systems. It gave the FAA 90 days to respond.

   With an estimated one million Americans
infected with the AIDS virus, the American Medical Association on
Monday announced plans to teach the public and front-line
physicians about the deadly disease.
   ``Virtually every physician will see AIDS or HIV disease
firsthand within the next 10 years,'' Dr. Roy M. Schwarz, the AMA's
top executive for Medical Education, said in opening the second
annual American Medical Association HIV conference.
   ``The AMA's posture is that every (physician) has to be prepared
to treat cases,'' he said. Schwarz estimated that five percent of
doctors and nurses refuse to treat AIDS patients.
   ``The ethics of the situation are patently clear. You cannot,
according to any ethical code ... refuse to treat anybody solely on
the basis of (positive HIV test), lifestyle, or frank HIV
disease,'' he said.
   The two-day AMA onference, combined with a campaign by the
Centers for Disease Control, came on the eve of the Sixth
International Conference on AIDS in San Francisco, which begins
Wednesday.
   Although ``getting Americans to realize what human
immunodeficiency virus is and the risks involved'' is crucial, said
Schwarz, the goal of the AMA is to instruct the physician to assume
leadership in providing patient counseling, specifically on the HIV
test.
   Schwarz displayed guidelines designed to teach doctors about
blood testing and counseling patients whose behavior may put them
at risk for the disease. Schwarz said an estimated million
Americans are HIV-infected, and that 15 million to 20 million
people may be infected globally by 2000.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   The scientific name for the virus is human immunodeficiency
virus, or HIV.
   The guidelines for physicians are frank. One section discusses
the physician's responsibility to learn beforehand whether a
patient might commit suicide if a blood test turns out positive.
   Dr. Gary Noble, CDC deputy director in charge of the HIV program
and assistant surgeon general of the U.S. Public Health Service,
told plans for a nationwide media blitz to get the AIDS story to
every American.
   Key to the program, dubbed ``Phase 5,'' are public service ads
on television, radio and in print. Four of the ads will be in
Spanish.
   ``We have two main goals in this phase. First, to familiarize
the public with HIV, since we want people to understand that HIV
infection can occur without symptoms and (the patient) can remain
relatively well for years...without developing AIDS,'' he said.
   ``The second goal is to get every American to think about how
much danger of HIV infection they may be at because of their own
behavior ... having sex with someone who has shared a needle with
an infected person,'' he said.
   Noble went on, ``We would hope that each individual would decide
if there is any danger that they have been infected and that urges
them to seek counseling and an appropriate evaluation. ... HIV can
happen to anyone.''

<HEAD>Satellite Woes Trouble Hurricane Specialists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As hurricane season begins,
burned-out light bulbs have forced storm specialists to rely on
one, instead of two, high-orbit weather satellites for the fifth
time in seven years.
   Only one high-orbit U.S. weather satellite is watching U.S.
coastlines, meaning that this year again, hurricane specialists
won't get a full picture of the Atlantic Ocean's hurricane breeding
grounds.
   Efforts to keep two satellites going haven't worked. So the
working one, being nudged into hurricane-season position at a mere
\ mph to save fuel, will have to get through the 1991 season alone.
   If this satellite, GOES 7, fails like three predecessors,
forecasters lose one of their best tools for monitoring everything
from hurricanes threatening the East Coast to typhoons off Hawaii.
   The problem is the satellites' $1,000 light bulbs, which create
the photographic images forecasters use to watch weather systems.
   Only one satellite has outlived its five-year design life before
its light bulbs burned out, and then by just seven months. Two
others lasted only three years before their $1,000 light bulbs
failed.
   A fourth satellite was lost in 1986 when the Delta rocket
carrying it had to be destroyed in flight.
   To solve the light bulb problem, GOES 7 also was equipped with
light-emitting diodes _ similar to what's used in calculators _
that should be more durable, said Gary Davis, NOAA's chief of
satellite operations.
   The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite, placed in
orbit 22,300 miles above Earth, has a speed matching Earth's
rotation, so it appears parked above a particular spot.
   When two GOES satellites work in tandem, forecasters can see
from the coast of Africa out into the Pacific Ocean beyond the
Hawaiian Islands. But NOAA has had trouble keeping two working at
once.
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says the $50
million GOES 7 is the sturdiest of its series.
   For two years, GOES 7 has bounced back and forth across the sky,
spending the hurricane season at 98 degrees longitude, above the
Galapagos Islands, and the rest of the year 611 miles to the west,
at 108 degrees longitude, where there's a better view of the
Pacific Ocean beyond the Hawaiian Islands.
   GOES 7 should be in hurricane position by Aug. 21. The season
runs June 1 to Nov. 30, but historically the worst storms are born
in September and October.
   The satellite's position is a compromise. GOES 7 will not be
able to see all the way to the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of
Africa, where killer hurricanes tend to form. But if it was moved
farther east, it couldn't be used to monitor Pacific Ocean storms.
   If GOES 7 fails, the National Hurricane Center still will be
able to get pictures four times a day from two polar-orbiting
weather satellites. And as a storm approaches land,
hurricane-hunter airplanes could provide updates.
   GOES has a tremendous public relations value, Lawrence said.
``All the news programs show the satellite pictures _ it's such an
excellent way to get people to respond to the threat,'' he said.
   Next summer, NOAA plans to launch the first of a new generation
of more powerful satellites called GOES Next. But that satellite
won't be ready for hurricane duty until 1992.
   Ground controllers hope they can keep GOES 7's fuel burning
slowly enough to keep its lights on until both GOES Next satellites
are up and running.

<TEXT>
   East German officials on Monday arrested
another Red Army Faction suspect, the eighth fugitive of the
terrorist organization taken into custody in 12 days.
   The official news agency ADN reported Silke Maier-Witt, one of
24 remaining top Red Army Faction suspects wanted by West Germany,
was arrested Monday afternoon without resistance.
   Ms. Maier-Witt, 40, is wanted in connection with the
kidnap-slaying of West German industry chief Hans-Martin Schleyer
in October 1977, and an attempted rocket attack against West
Germany's federal prosecutor's office in August 1977.
   ADN, quoting a statement from the East German Interior Ministry,
did not say where in East Germany that the woman's arrest occurred.
   Interior Minister Peter Michael Diestel, in a statement said he
plans to hold a news conference on Ms. Maier-Witt's arrest Tuesday,
ADN said in the short report.
   No one from the West German Federal Prosecutor's office could be
immediately reached late Monday for comment.
   The Red Army Faction has been waging attacks against NATO, U.S.
and West German industrial targets since the early 1970s. Among
those killed were a U.S. Army officer and leading West German
bankers and industrialists.
   The first of the recent arrests took place June 6, when East
German officials announced the apprehension in East Berlin of
Sussanne Albrecht. The 39-year-old suspect is also wanted in the
Schleyer case and for killing prominent Dresdner bank chief Juergen
Ponto in July 1977.
   A week later, officials arrested Inge Viett, 46, in the East
German city of Magdeburg. Ms. Viett has been linked to the murder
of prominent West Berlin Judge Guenter von Drenkmann in 1974, and
the shooting death of a French policeman in 1981.
   On June 15, authorities announced the arrest of four more
suspected terrorists in the East German cities of Frnkfurt an der
Oder and Cottbus.
   They have been identified as Monika Helbing, 36, Ekkehard von
Seckendorff-Gudent, 39, Werner Lotze, 38, and Christine Duemlein,
41.
   Ms. Helbing and Lotze have also been linked to the Schleyer case.
   Seckendorff-Gudent, a doctor, who had a permanent visitor's pass
to a Hamburg prison, is accused of supporting the gang by providing
his pass to other terrorists to visit their jailed comrades.
   Ms. Duemlein was released shortly after her arrest because the
warrant against her, issued in 1980 for being a suspected terrorist
group member, expired in 1985. West German officials said the
warrant will not be renewed.
   On June 16, officials arrested Red Army Faction suspect, Sigrid
Sternebeck, 40, who is wanted in the shooting death of U.S. Army
Spec. 4 Edward Pimental in August 1985.
   Sternebeck allegedly lured the soldier out of a discotheque near
Wiesbaden to steal his identification card.
   The identification card was used the next day to plant a car
bomb at the headquarters building of the U.S. Air Force's
Rhine-Main Air Base. Two more Americans were killed in the Aug. 8,
1985, blast and 20 people were injured.
   West Germany have been infuriated by revelations that some of
its top fugitives were sheltered by the now ousted Communists.
   Both Sternebeck and Albrecht have told investigators they were
provided help and new identification by East German secret police,
ADN reported.
   Eduard Lintner, a leading conservative lawmaker in Bonn, has
called for former East German leader Erich Honecker and his top
lieutenants to be extradited to West Germany to face possible
charges of aiding the terrorists.
   But early Monday, West German Chief Federal Prosecutor,
Alexander von Stahl, said in an interview with Deutschlandfunk
radio in Cologne that ``until now there are only vague
indications'' of official support for West German terrorists during
the Honecker era.
   ``Simply providing the Red Army Faction members with shelter is
insufficient for an indictment against the former leaders of the
German Democratic Republic for supporting a criminal
organization,'' von Stahl said.

<TEXT>
   An Indian tribe can enforce its own hiring
and promotion laws against a non-Indian employer operating within
the reservation, a federal appeals court ruled Monday.
   Reversing a lower-court decision, the panel of the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 3-0 that the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes
on the Fort Hall Reservation in southeastern Idaho could regulate
employment practices at a phosphorus plant owned by FMC Corp. on
private land inside the reservation borders.
   The tribes said FMC, the largest employer on the reservation,
with 600 workers, had violated a 1981 agreement requiring it to
hire and promote more Indians. The tribes' suit sought enforcement
of their ordinance requiring preferential hiring and promotion of
Indians by all employers on the reservation.
   ``This is an extremely important case to Indian tribes,'' said
Melody McCoy, lawyer for the Native American Rights Fund, which
filed papers siding with the Shoshone-Bannocks. She said several
other cases pending in the court raise the same issue of tribal
authority over non-Indian employers.
   ``Most reservations suffer from severe unemployment and Sho-Ban
is no exception,'' McCoy said. ``When there are big employers like
FMC, they are trying to say, `You're on our reservation, taking
tribal resources and making a profit. How about cutting us some of
the pie?'''
   FMC's lawyer in the case did not return telephone calls. The
company could appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.
   The tribes, dissatisfied in late 1986 with FMC's performance
under the 1981 agreement, sued the company in Tribal Court.
   FMC's employment record is ``very bleak,'' the tribes' general
counsel, Jeanette Wolfley, said Monday. ``They only employ a
handful of Indians.'' She said the company also fell far short of
the required standards for promotions and contracting with
Indian-owned firms.
   The Tribal Appellate Court ordered FMC to choose qualified
Indians for 75 percent of new jobs and all new promotions, give
local Indians one-third of all training opportunities, and pay a
$100,000 annual fee.
   FMC went to federal court and won a ruling in April 1988 from
U.S. District Judge Marion Callister that it was not governed by
the tribal ordinance. But the appeals court disagreed.
   The court said the phosphorus plant, though on privately owned
land within the reservation borders, uses minerals from tribal land
under leases with the Indians and is subject to tribal taxation.
   ``FMC actively engaged in commerce with the tribes and so has
subjected itself to the civil jurisdiction of the tribes,'' said
the opinion by Judge Jerome Farris.
   The court did not order immediate enforcement of the tribal
hiring plan, however. Instead, the case was returned to the Tribal
Appellate Court to consider any claims by FMC that its rights would
be violated by the application of the tribal ordinance.

   The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday let stand a
decision that granted a lifetime professorship to a woman whose
sexual bias lawsuit alleged that Boston University President John
Silber harbored sexist attitudes.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the lower
court decision interfered with the school's academic freedom. The
decision required the university to grant tenure to Julia Prewitt
Brown.
   ``I am glad that the Supreme Court has affirmed the longstanding
authority of college faculties to judge scholarship and teaching,
an authority that has been undermined of late by the impositions of
college administrators,'' Ms. Brown said in a statement released by
her attorney.
   Ms. Brown, who now teaches at Providence College, intends to
return to Boston University, said Dahlia Rudavsky, her lawyer.
``She wants to go back. Now that we're at a logical place between
semesters, she'll be back soon.''
   Ms. Brown had been teaching at Boston for six years when she
became eligible for tenure in 1979. An English department committee
voted 22-0 that she receive tenure, and its recommendation was
supported 9-2 by a university committee.
   Silber opposed tenure and recommended instead that she remain on
probation for three more years. Silber relied in part on a report
by the university provost questioning Ms. Brown's scholarly
credentials.
   Silber on Monday said the issue was settled and he wished Ms.
Brown ``all the best.''
   He also defended himself against accusations that he was biased
against women, saying that 25 percent of the full-time faculty at
Boston University are women and that 28 percent of the women have
tenure, figures that compare favorably with many other universities.
   Silber is on leave from the university to run for governor of
Massachusetts as a Democrat. His campaign spokeswoman, Michal
Regunberg, said she was not familiar with the Supreme Court action
and could not comment.
   Ms. Brown had published a book of criticism on Jane Austen's
novels that generally was well reviewed by other scholars. But the
provost said the university should await further evidence of Ms.
Brown's abilities before awarding tenure.
   After Ms. Brown rejected the offer of three more years on
probation, the university board of trustees denied her tenure.
   The university argued that evidence of Silber's alleged sexism
should not have been presented to a federal jury that awarded Ms.
Brown $200,000. A judge added $15,000 to compensate her for
emotional distress, and ordered the university to reinstate her
with lifetime tenure.
   As evidence of Silber's alleged sexism, Ms. Brown introduced
several statements made by Silber.
   One included a remark he made describing the English department
as ``a damn matriarchy'' at a time when the department was headed
by a woman and included six female and 20 male faculty members.
   Silber also had told another woman on the faculty that she
should not be worried about job security since ``your husband is a
parachute,'' an apparent reference to the fact her husband was
employed.
   The jury also heard a portion of an old speech by Silber in
which he lamented the lack of parental supervision in families in
which both husbands and wives work outside the home.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in ruling last year for
Ms. Brown, refused to order a new trial in which the Silber remarks
would be excluded.
   The appeals court also rejected the university's arguments that
awarding Ms. Brown a lifetime job interfered with its academic
freedom.
   ``Academic freedom does not include the freedom to discriminate
against tenure candidates on the basis of sex or other
impermissible grounds,'' the appeals court said. ``Awarding (Ms.
Brown) tenure is the only way to provide her the most complete
relief possible.''

<HEAD>West German Prosecutor: No Charges Against Honecker for Now</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany's chief prosecutor said Monday
there is insufficient evidence for bringing criminal charges
against former East German leader Erich Honecker, despite claims
his regime harbored leftist terrorists.
   However, he indicated that charges could be brought in the
future.
   West Germans have been infuriated by revelations that some of
their most wanted fugitives were once sheltered by the East German
Communists who were ousted in last year's democratic revolution.
   Those disclosures came to light with the recent capture of seven
suspected members of the Red Army Faction terrorist group. Eduard
Lintner, a member Helmut Kohl's governing coalition in West
Germany, has called for Honecker's extradition to face
terrorist-related charges in West Germany.
   This weekend, chief West German prosecutor Alexander von Stahl
was quoted by a newspaper as saying he was investigating whether
there was evidence to bring charges against Honecker and his ousted
deputies.
   However, in a radio interview Monday, von Stahl said that
``until now there are only vague indications'' of official support
for West German terrorists during the Honecker era.
   Von Stahl told Deutschlandfunk Radio of Cologne that he was
ruling out for the time being bringing charges against Honecker,
his security chief Erich Mielke and legendary former spy chief
Markus Wolf. The ex-spy has denied any contacts with Red Army
Faction terrorists.
   ``Simply providing the Red Army Faction members with shelter is
insufficient for an indictment against the former leaders of the
German Democratic Republic for supporting a criminal
organization,'' von Stahl said.
   ``A criminal probe against Honecker, Mielke and their
accomplices could only be started if it can be proved they
knowingly or intentionally provided Red Army Faction members with
active help,'' von Stahl said.
   Honecker, Mielke and other members his regime are already
targets of probes by East German prosecutors investigating charges
of corruption. It is uncertain whether any trials will result,
however.

<HEAD>Government Inquiry in Zaire Confirms Massacre of Students</HEAD>

   Local authorities approved a nighttime
raid by masked commandos who infiltrated a southern university and
reportedly massacred up to 150 students, a parliamentary panel said
Monday.
   The panel report said the commandos entered Lubumubashi
University, in that city near the Zambian border, the night of May
11 after power was cut off. Earlier news reports said the attackers
slit the students' throats with knives and bayonets.
   Monday's parliament report said the attack was ``premeditated
and meticulously prepared.''
   The report said three student informers, all from President
Mobutu Sese Seko's home province of Equateur, persuaded local
officials to launch the attack in revenge because the informers had
been discovered by students and beaten. Students have been at the
vanguard of opposition to one-party rule in this central African
country.
   Although Mobutu said this year he will allow other parties, he
remains in complete control of the government.
   The governor of Shaba Province, Koyagialo Ngbase, ordered the
university campus surrounded by the military to prevent students
from escaping during the attack, the report said.
   Mobutu appoints all governors, and Ngbase is also from Mobutu's
home province.
   The governor has been transferred to another province but
remains free.
   The report by members of parliament said the exact number of
deaths is unknown but may be as high as 150.
   The parliamentarians criticized the local military commander,
saying he made no effort to stop the recruitment of a commando unit
for the attack. The report also says he refused to help students
when they were attacked.
   Members of the committee that wrote the report, speaking during
a parliamentary debate, vowed those responsible will be brought to
justice. Until now, the only people detained are six accused of
spreading rumors about the attack.
   The government ordered the report. In the past, the parliament
has backed the decisions of Mobutu, who has ruled since 1965.
   Angry about the massacres, Belgium, the former colony power, has
frozen all new aid to Zaire.
   The U.S. State Department said in its annual human rights report
that security organizations in Zaire regularly harass, detain and
brutalize citizens.

<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The body of the wife of a West German
industrialist who died in a 1973 IRA kidnapping has washed up on a
beach south of the Irish capital, police said Monday.
   Authorities said there were no indications of foul play.
   The Irish Times said the fully clothed body of Ingeborg
Niedermayer was found on a beach at Greystones, 18 miles south of
Dublin, on Friday afternoon.
   The newspaper said Mrs. Niedermayer, 62, had booked into a hotel
at nearby Bray last week after arriving on a visit from West
Germany.
   A police spokesman confirmed the body was that of Mrs.
Niedermayer.
   In December 1973, Thomas Niedermayer, then 45, was kidnapped
from his home in Belfast, Northern Ireland.
   Niedermayer was the honorary West German consul in Belfast and
head of the Grundig electronic company's plant in the British
province.
   Despite repeated pleas from his family, there was no word of his
fate until 1980, when his body was found buried in a garbage dump
near his home. A member of the Irish Republican Army, John Bradley,
confessed to taking part in the kidnapping.
   Police accepted Bradley's testimony that Niedermayer died of a
heart attack during a struggle soon after being seized. Bradley is
serving a 20-year jail term for manslaughter.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the province with the Catholic Republic of Ireland.
   In London, the Daily Telegraph said Mrs. Niedermayer apparently
walked into the sea. It didn't say whether she died from an
accident or suicide.

<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk and
the leaders of six black tribal homelands agreed Monday that talks
on ending apartheid should begin as soon as possible.
   South African newspapers said de Klerk met the homeland leaders
in a bid to find allies prior to opening formal constitutional
negotiations with black opposition groups such as the African
National Congress.
   De Klerk and the homeland leaders met at the president's office
in Cape Town to discuss prospects for negotiations on the new
constitution that will include the country's 28 million black
majority.
   All parties at the meeting agreed that ``negotiations for a new
constitution should be the highest priority and should start as
soon as possible,'' according to a statement by de Klerk's office.
   De Klerk says he wants to end racial discrimination and bring
blacks into the national government. But he opposes the one-man,
one-vote, majority-rule system that black leaders such as ANC
leader Nelson Mandela have been demanding, saying it will replace
white domination with black domination.
   He envisions a mechanism that will give the 5 million whites
veto power on major policy decisions.
   De Klerk arranged a meeting with homeland leaders earlier this
year, but most canceled at the last moment, reportedly under
pressure from the ANC.
   South Africa has 10 black homelands. None is recognized abroad.
   The ANC considers the homelands part of the country's apartheid
system of racial segregation.
   De Klerk met Monday with the leaders of the six
``self-governing'' territories. The leaders of the four homelands
the South African government considers independent were not present.
   The president has made clear that homeland leaders would be
welcome to participate in negotiations on a new constitution.
   Several homeland leaders, such as KwaZulu Chief Minister
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, are relatively conservative and considered
potential government allies.
   In other developments Monday:
   _ The leader of the ANC's military wing, Chris Hani, returned to
South Africa from the group's exile headquarters in Zambia. Most of
the ANC leadership now is inside South Africa for the first time
since the group was banned in 1960, forcing leaders to go
underground or into exile. De Klerk legalized the ANC in February.
   _ A black man was killed when a grenade he was carrying exploded
prematurely, said police in the black homeland of Bophuthatswana.
The man and two accomplices were confronted by police at a railway
station when the grenade went off, police said. A second suspect
killed himself with a gun and a third suspect escaped, police said.
   Mandela is currently in Canada on a 14-nation tour that will
take him on Wednesday to the United States.

   Townspeople on Monday began burying
victims of flash floods that ravaged a rural area near this
Appalachian village, and the death toll rose to 22.
   Searchers looking for 14 people still listed as missing turned
their attention to the debris-clogged Ohio River and found the body
of a 13-year-old girl who was swept away by flood waters while
playing at a friend's house.
   The body of Kerri Polivka, 13, was found in the river about 3
miles below the mouth of Wegee Creek. Kerri was at the home of a
friend, 9-year-old Amber Colvin, when the storm struck the
one-story house Thursday.
   The two girls jumped into a bathtub for safety, but it was
washed into Wegee Creek. Flood waters carried Amber about seven
miles into the Ohio River, but she survived by clinging to logs for
7{ hours before reaching shore.
   Thirteen people still were listed as missing Monday night.
   The first funeral for a flood victim was held in a funeral home
that was used as a temporary morgue. About 100 people crowded into
three rooms to mourn the death of Roger DeNoon Sr., 51.
   ``It rained and it thundered this morning. And they say when it
rains on the morning of the funeral, the dead go to heaven,'' said
DeNoon's daughter, Kimberly. ``That was his way of saying goodbye,
because he didn't get a chance to say goodbye.''
   ``I'm not sure any of us can prepare for this type of a
tragedy,'' said Capt. Tim Muir, a Salvation Army chaplain who
delivered the eulogy. ``The thing we have to look at is found in
Isaiah 38:1 _ `Thus saith the Lord: ``Set thy house in order, for
thou shalt die and not live.'''
   DeNoon's body was carried out of the Bauknecht Funeral Home in a
casket draped with an American flag. He was to be buried in
Cambridge, about 50 miles west of Shadyside.
   Funerals also were held for John and Edna Andrecht of Shadyside
and for 6-year-old Timmy Gatten in Jacobsburg.
   The Ohio flash flood Thursday night was the most serious in a
series of severe storms that have hit parts of the Midwest and East.
   The National Weather Service meteorologist in charge of the
station responsible for Belmont County said Monday that the storm
developed so rapidly a flood warning would not have helped.
   ``We're dealing with God Almighty here, nature itself. Sometimes
nature just isn't predictable,'' Ed Heath said at a news conference
in Shadyside.
   But the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which
oversees the weather service, planned to investigate why a flood
warning _ which alerts that flooding has occurred or is imminent _
was not issued.
   On Monday, a fast-moving line of thunderstorms whipped across
large portions of New York state, leaving fires, blackouts and
homes crushed by trees.
   In Iowa, a second day of sunshine allowed floodwaters to recede.
At least three deaths were blamed on the storm. Fifteen more Iowa
counties were declared disaster areas, bringing the total to 22.
   Divers on Monday began probing rubble on the bottom of the river
near the mouths of the Wegee and Pipe creeks as well as floating
debris that accumulated at the Hannibal, Ohio, lock and dam, about
25 miles south of Shadyside.
   Automobiles had been pushed down the creek valleys and into the
river by a 25-foot-high wall of water that surged from the
highlands, wiping out homes, bridges, trees and utility poles,
officials said.
   Floating debris such as tree limbs, furniture, natural gas tanks
and toys began to clog the locks and dam, and the Army Corps of
Engineers was asked to help remove it, said Capt. Jim Boling of the
Ohio National Guard.
   Federal officials were trying to assess whether river barge
traffic was impeded by the debris, he said.
   At least 18 divers from West Virginia arrived Monday to help
Ohio divers search for additional bodies.
   Nine horseback officers were brought in from Coshocton County in
east-central Ohio in the search for the first time, according to
Belmont County Sheriff Tom McCort. The horses allow officers search
more of the rugged terrain more quickly, he said.
   Federal Emergency Management Agency officials said a preliminary
estimate showed that 700 homes in Belmont and neighboring Jefferson
and Harrison counties were destroyed or damaged from the deluge, 5{
inches of rain within 3{ hours.
   People whose homes and belongings were swept away say they will
have to begin putting their lives back together largely without the
benefit of insurance.
   Few residents in this eastern Ohio coal-mining and steel-making
area along the Wegee and Pipe creeks felt the need to carry flood
insurance, and homeowners' insurance will not cover damage,
residents and local insurers said.
   ``We didn't think we needed to have flood insurance. For what?
That creek never flooded. Then this. Everybody just got wiped
out,'' said Julia Kulazenka, 62.

   A 21-year-old Israeli on Monday was charged
with the murder of seven Palestinians in an attack that set off
unrest in which 20 other people died.
   A five-man psychiatric panel rejected a claim that the suspect,
Ami Popper, was unfit to stand trial, officials said.
   Prosecutor Nurit Smith said Popper would face a mandatory life
sentence if convicted by a Tel Aviv court of slaying the seven Arab
laborers and wounding 10.
   In the May 20 killings, a gunman ordered about 50 Palestinians
to sit in rows as they waited for day jobs in the Tel Aviv suburb
of Rishon Letzion. He then fired an assault rifle on the unarmed
laborers.
   The attack sparked riots in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip in which 18 Palestinians were killed, most by army gunfire.
Two Israelis also died in what authorities said were revenge
attacks.
   Authorities said at the time that Popper, who was discharged
early from the Israeli army for disciplinary problems, was deranged
and upset by an uphappy love affair. His lawyer, David Ofek,
claimed Popper tried to hang himself in jail.

   Tamil guerrillas withdrew into the
jungles and pledged to continue their violent civil war after a
2-day-old cease-fire broke down Monday.
   Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne told Parliament that
security forces killed 600 fighters of the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam in three days of battles. He gave no information on
government casualties.
   An additional 378 people, including 137 disarmed policemen
massacred by the Tigers, are reported to have been killed since
June 11, when the rebels ended a 13-month-old truce. The death toll
was compiled from reports by witnesses, military officials and
Tiger sources.
   Tamil rebels took up arms against the Sinhalese-dominated
government in 1983 in a quest for a separate homeland for the
country's Tamil minority. More than 11,000 people have died in the
insurrection.
   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
have long accused the Sinhalese majority of discriminating against
them.
   The cease-fire, which started at sundown Saturday, had been
marred by minor attacks over the weekend. By midday Monday, both
sides reported exchanges of fire along the east coast and in the
north.
   A spokesman for the Tamil Tigers, contacted by telephone in the
eastern town of Batticaloa, said ``we continue our retreat into the
jungles. We will fight from there.''
   Batticaloa, 136 miles from Colombo on the east coast, and
Jaffna, 186 miles northeast of the capital, have been the major
flashpoints in the fighting.
   A defense ministry statement said ``since the cease-fire has
been violated by the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam),
security forces are taking all action to restore law and order in
the affected areas.''
   The statement added that military area commanders have been
appointed to ``act resolutely against terrorism.''
   On Monday morning, Tiger fighters in Batticaloa set fire to a
police station they captured a week ago and streamed out of town
toward the jungle in at least 100 jeeps, vans and small trucks, a
local journalist said.
   In reaction, Wijeratne said ``unless they stop this nonsense, we
won't talk to them, we will push them all into the Indian Ocean.''
   Justice Minister Shahul Hameed, who negotiated the truce on
Saturday, told parliament his efforts to bring peace have failed.
   ``My genuine efforts to bring about an end to this carnage have
failed. I appeal to everybody to help restore sanity in this
country,'' Hameed said.
   Since the fighting started, the Tigers have taken over about 20
police stations.
   At least 850 policemen, ordered by their government not to
return fire, surrendered to the Tigers last week. The fate of most
of them is unknown but a lone policeman who escaped and military
sources said at least 137 of the captive policemen were killed by
the militants hours after they surrendered.

   A gunman ``loaded for war'' Monday
stalked through an auto loan company that had repossessed his car,
firing at customers, shooting under desks at hiding employees and
leaving eight dead before killing himself.
   Five others victims were listed in critical but stable condition
after the late morning shootings by semiautomatic gunfire at the
General Motors Acceptance Corp. office south of downtown.
   The gunman also killed two people on the streets near his
Jacksonville home Sunday, authorities said.
   Richard Langille, a GMAC employee, said office workers dived
under desks when the first of about 50 shots rang out in Monday's
attack.
   ``And then we realized the guy was pointing his gun underneath
people's desks and killing them one by one,'' said Langille. ``I
just saw the bottom of the carpet and just prayed.''
   Some of the wounded were shot seven or eight times each,
hospital spokesmen said.
   ``The suspect apparently went in the front door and shot a
couple of customers,'' said Sheriff James McMillan. ``Then he went
right through the office indiscriminately shooting employees, then
turned the weapon on himself.''
   The gunman, James Edward Pough, 42, a day laborer from
Jacksonville, had recently had a vehicle repossessed by GMAC, the
sheriff said. McMillan said it was not known if that was the sole
motive. The company said the car was a 1988 Pontiac Grand Am
repossessed in January.
   Pough began firing almost as soon as he walked through the door,
McMillan said.
   After shooting two customers, one fatally, he methodically went
from desk to desk firing his rifle, witnesses said.
   The gunman used a .30-caliber, clip-fed semiautomatic rifle for
most of the shooting, but also had a .38-caliber revolver,
authorities said. Police found several rifle clips, some empty and
some full, inside the office.
   ``There's numerous magazines, plus numerous rounds in his
pockets,'' said Deputy Ken Bozeman. ``He was loaded for war.''
   A 9mm semiautomatic pistol was found in Pough's car parked
outside of the building, McMillan said. He also had a .357-caliber
Magnum registered to his name, but no information was given on that
weapon's location.
   The .38-caliber revolver used in the shootings was registered
June 4, 1979, McMillan said. Agents from the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were checking whether the rifle was
registered.
   Pough was arrested in 1971 in Duval County on a charge of
homicide, but was never convicted. In July 1971, he was given five
years probation on a charge of aggravated assault, according to
Florida Department of Corrections records.
   The 1971 court records show that adjudication would be withheld
after his probation period, meaning that Pough would not have a
record in that case if he obeyed the terms of probation. That would
mean he could legally possess a gun.
   The sheriff said that Pough also was arrested in 1968 ``for
dangerously displaying a weapon.''
   McMillan said Pough has also been ``positively identified'' by
witnesses as the killer of a man and woman in separate shootings
early Sunday.
   Louis Carl Bacon, 39, and Doretta Drake, 30, were walking
through a northwest section of Jacksonville, near where Pough
lived, and were killed with the same .30-caliber rifle used in the
Monday massacre, McMillan said.
   McMillan said at least one of the Sunday shootings stemmed from
arguments over ``services of a prostitute.'' He did not elaborate.
   Records show that Pough was married, but neighbors told
reporters they had not seen his wife for some time.
   At the GMAC, five employees, a customer and the gunman died at
the scene at the Baymeadows office complex, said John Andrews, a
company spokesman in Detroit. Two other employees died at hospitals.
   The wounded were airlifted or taken by ambulance to University
Hospital, Baptist Medical Center and St. Luke's Hospital, where
they were in critical but stable condition.
   Jay Edelberg, of Baptist Medical, said the three wounded brought
there had been shot repeatedly.
   One man had gunshot wounds on both sides of his chest and in his
abdomen, Edelberg said. A woman was shot eight times, including
both sides of her chest and her abdomen.
   ``The third one, who is the most stable, probably had the worst
injuries because she got hit about seven times, hitting her arms,
her legs, shattering bones and severing nerves and arteries,'' the
Baptist spokesman said.
   A special crisis team was at the shooting scene and police set
up a counseling center in a building next door.
   Investigators were trying to interview witnesses but McMillan
said ``the are all in a state of shock, understandably.''
   Pough was arrested in 1971 in Duval County on a charge of
homicide, but was never convicted. In July 1971, he was given
probation on a charge of aggravated assault, according to Florida
Department of Corrections records.
   In addition to Pough, the dead were identified as Drew Woods,
Denise Highfill, Janice David, Sharon Louise Hall, Barbara Duckwall
Holland, Julia White Burgess, Lee Simonton, and Cynthia Perry.
   The wounded were Ron Ecchevaria, Jewel Belote, Nancy Dill,
Phyllis Griggs and David Hendrix.
   The death total matched the worst single-day episode in Florida,
a 1982 massacre at a Miami machine shop where nine died and three
were wounded.

<HEAD>U.S. Ambassador Criticizes New York City for Honor to IRA Convict</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Ambassador to Britain Henry Catto wrote to
the mayor of New York on Monday to express shock that the city
named a street corner after an IRA member convicted of killing a
British soldier.
   Mayor David Dinkins approved the honor Friday for Joseph
Doherty, who was convicted in the 1980 killing of a British soldier
in Belfast, Northern Ireland.
   The proposal to name the corner after Doherty was championed by
his supporters, some of whom are politically influential in New
York. When Dinkins signed the bill, he pointed out that Doherty has
not been charged with any crime in the United States.
   ``Mr. Doherty is no hero,'' Catto said in a letter to Dinkins
released to the news media. ``The IRA is a gang of murderers, which
deserves New York City's condemnation _ not its commemoration.''
   ``Terrorism is contemptible, regardless of any claimed
justification,'' Catto wrote. ``The IRA is a terrorist organization
whose latest victims have included women, infants and tourists.''
   The outlawed organization, in its latest offensive, has been
aiming mainly at British targets outside Northern Ireland. Seven
people have been killed in those attacks the past few weeks.
   The predominantly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule
in Northern Ireland and unite the 60 percent Protestant province
with the 95 percent Catholic Irish Republic.
   About 900 members of the British security forces have been
killed in IRA attacks since sectarian and political fighting
erupted in Northern Ireland in 1969. Several hundred civilians have
also died in IRA attacks over the same period.
   Doherty escaped from prison in 1983 and fled to the United
States, where he has spent seven years behind bars awaiting an
appeal against extradition.
   In New York, a spokeswoman for Dinkins' office said the bill
proposing the renaming of the street corner after Doherty was put
forward by two city council members and backed by 13 others.
   ``As part of the process, we ask people to speak in favor and
against a bill,'' she said. ``Nobody spoke against this one.''
   About 1,500 of Doherty's supporters rallied in Manhattan on
Saturday to demand his freedom.
   The demonstrators marched past Park Row and Pearl streets, where
a green sign now marks ``Joe Doherty Corner.'' The Metropolitan
Correction Center, at the corner, is where Doherty is held.

<HEAD>About 1,500 Evacuated After Plant Releases Vapor Cloud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEDALIA, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cloud of irritating vapor escaped from a
chemical plant early Monday, forcing the six-hour evacuation of
about 1,500 people and sending 29 to a hospital for treatment. No
one was seriously hurt.
   Authorities sounded sirens and knocked on doors in three small
towns and in part of this western Missouri city to alert people to
the emergency at the Alcolac Inc. chemical plant, at about 2 a.m.
   At about 8 a.m., officials determined the leak from a
10,000-gallon tank of allyl methacrylate no longer posed health
risks and allowed residents to return home.
   The chemical is used in coatings for electronic printed circuit
boards. In vapor form it can irritate the skin, nose, throat and
lungs, officials said.
   ``It's got a very low odor threshold, so you'd smell it a lot
sooner than it would have any health effects,'' said Richard
Faulkner, plant manager at Alcolac, which makes soap, cleaning
materials and specialty chemicals.
   Fire Chief Mike Ditzfeld said the vapor release was caused by a
chemical reaction in a storage tank.

   Hundreds of former resistance fighters joined
political and church leaders Monday at a tribute to Charles De
Gaulle on the 50th anniversary of his historic radio appeal for
armed struggle against the Nazis.
   Notre Dame Cathedral was filled with an audience that included
Premier Michel Rocard, Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac and British
Ambassador Sir Ewen Fergusson. De Gaulle's son, Philippe, also was
there.
   Roman Catholic Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger of Paris praised De
Gaulle's crucial role in the struggle ``for the dignity of all men
aganst inhuman and totalitarian ambition.''
   Later, many dignitaries and resistance veterans looked on as
President Francois Mitterrand unveiled a plaque at the Arc de
Triomphe inscribed with the text of De Gaulle's appeal. Church
bells throughout France chimed to mark the occasion.
   Thousands of tourists and Parisians flocked Monday to the Place
de la Concorde, where a 115-foot-high replica of a 1940s radio
re-broadcast the June 18 call from London and other well-known De
Gaulle speeches.
   Few of De Gaulle's countrymen actually heard his dramatic
appeal, in a voice edged with tension: ``Has the last word been
said? Must we abandon all hope? Is our defeat final? No! ... France
is not alone ... the flame of the resistance must not and shall not
die.''
   Many of those who did manage to tune in the BBC to hear it knew
little about the general claiming to represent France. Instead,
they preferred the grandfatherly reassurances of Philippe Petain, a
World War I field marshal, who urged surrender to the Germans.
Petain became the head of the collaborationist Vichy regime.
   De Gaulle's fervent, four-minute speech helped change the course
of French history.
   The resistance movement played a critical role in the Allied
victory. After the war, De Gaulle founded a political party and
served as president from 1959 to 1969. He died a year later.
   Daylong celebrations of De Gaulle's broadcast culminated Monday
night with a sound and light extravaganza on the Seine River.
   More than 100,000 spectators crowded onto river banks and
bridges to watch as scores of barges floated down the Seine
carrying torches, flags and hundreds of performers in period
costume reenacting the German invasion of France, De Gaulle's
flight to London, D-Day and the liberation.
   The show included simulations of the bombings raids that
terrified civilians when France fell. At that time, three-fifths of
the population took to the roads in cars, wagons, bicycles and even
wheelbarrows to escape the German onslaught.
   The show, which also celebrates the centenary of De Gaulle's
birth, cost $5.7 million, raised from private sources by De Gaulle
Centenary Association.
   Early Monday, vandals demaged and defaced De Gaulle memorials in
three communities on the northern outskirts of Paris, police said.
No arrests were reported.

<HEAD>Three Found Guilty Of Making Weapons For IRA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury on Monday convicted two men and a
woman of conspiring to supply the Irish Republican Army with
sophisticated anti-helicopter missiles and other weapons.
   U.S. District Judge David A. Mazzone scheduled an Aug. 20
sentencing for Richard C. Johnson, 41, of Nashua, N.H.; Martin
Quigley, 27, of Dundalk, Ireland, and Christina L. Reid, 25, a
computer technician from Sunnyvale, Calif.
   The trio was convicted on a range of charges including
conspiracy to violate the federal Arms Export Act and to injure or
destroy property belonging to the United Kingdom; possessing
property to aid foreign insurgents; and aiding an insurgent group
in violation of U.S. laws, said Mazzone's clerk, Deborah Whitney.
   A fourth defendant, Gerald Hoy, of Easton, Pa., pleaded guilty
last week. A fifth, Peter E. MaGuire, is a fugitive believed to be
in Ireland.
   Johnson faces a maximum sentence of 28 years, Quigley 18 years,
and Reid and Hoy 8 years apiece.
   The trial, which began May 1, featured testimony by Irish
nationalist Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, a former member of the
British Parliament.
   Prosecutors introduced secretly taped conversations in which the
defendants allegedly discussed developing a system to shoot down
low-flying helicopters.
   The FBI began watching Johnson in 1983, when the radar
specialist bought detonator switches.
   ``I just got some diodes and I'm going to start experimenting
... and see what kind of range I can get out of them,'' Johnson
told Quigley as they sat in a McDonald's parking lot, according to
the government.
   FBI agents arrested the group in July after Johnson, an engineer
with top-secret security clearance at the Mitre Corp., surprised
federal agents placing a bug in his car as it was parked in the
Bedford company's lot.
   Johnson allegedly used his parents' basement on Cape Cod as an
experimental laboratory in which he made explosive fuses for
anti-helicopter missiles.
   Defense attorneys dismissed such claims and claimed their
clients merely shared an interest in high-technology electronics.
   Quigley's lawyer Richard Bachman told the jurors the case was
like ``16 of you getting together and building a nuclear submarine
in somebody's cellar.''
   McAliskey, who appeared in court Wednesday as the last defense
witness, testified the IRA could not be considered an insurgent
group, because it seeks to overthrow a government imposed by force,
not by democratic vote.

<HEAD>Doe Lifts Ban on Opposition Parties, Declares Amnesty</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Samuel Doe, in a bid to bring
anti-government rebels into the political system, lifted a ban on
opposition parties Monday and declared an amnesty for all his
regime's opponents.
   Doe said he hoped rebel forces, who have been observing an
informal cease-fire with government soldiers, would accept the
amnesty and form a political party.
   There was no immediate response from rebels who have waged a war
since late December to topple Doe. But rebel leader Charles Taylor
refused similar offers from Doe earlier this month.
   Opposition parties say Doe, with his back to the wall and an
army too weak to defeat the rebels, is offering too little, too
late.
   The president said Monday he was granting a general and
unconditional amnesty to all members of the rebel's National
Patriotic Front, as well as all others living at home and abroad
who have been implicated in anti-government activities since 1980.
   A statement from Doe's executive mansion said he was lifting
bans on the Liberian Unification Party and the Liberian People's
Party in ``a further move to heal ... wounds, restore peace and
ensure the full participation of all Liberians in the political
process.''
   The move was ``a further demonstration of the seriousness
government attaches to the ongoing peace process,'' it said.
   Rebels and government troops confronting each other near a
U.S.-managed Firestone rubber plantation 35 miles from Monrovia
have held off fighting since peace talks opens a week ago in
Freetown, Sierra Leone.
   The two sides adjourned talks Saturday for a week after they
were able to agree only to exercise restraint in the fighting.
   The insurgency began with a rebel invasion from the neighboring
West African nation of Ivory Coast and has since escalated into a
tribal conflict. Both groups have murdered thousands of civilians
in attacks on suspected supporters of the other side.
   Rebels accuse Doe of corruption and rights abuses. They say he
should resign. Internal and external government opponents back the
rebel call.
   The Liberian leader announced two weeks ago he would not stand
for re-election. But he has refused to resign immediately, saying
it would leave a dangerous power vacuum in this West African
country during the conflict.
   Doe took power in a violent 1980 coup that ousted descendants of
the freed American slaves who founded Liberia in 1847. They
historically monopolized power and discriminated against indigenous
Liberians in this country of 2.5 million residents.
   It was not clear whether Doe's amnesty includes hundreds of
government soldiers from the Gio and Mano tribes detained in
Monrovia for more than a week. The government has refused to
comment on reports that some of them have been killed.
   Most rebels come from the two tribes.

<HEAD>California Biker Launches Last Leg of Trip Across Great Wall</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A California man who has become the first person
to bicycle any substantial distance along the Great Wall set out
Monday for the final leg of his 1,255-mile journey.
   Kevin Foster, 30, has already peddled 1,065 miles and said he's
having ``the best time I ever had.''
   Foster left Monday from Mutianyu, northeast of Beijing, for the
final 190 miles of his adventure. Mutianyu, about 42 miles from the
capital, is marked by steep mountains and rugged terrain.
   Foster said he plans to reach the eastern end of the Great Wall,
which China's emperors originally built more than 2,000 years ago
to keep out foreigners, at Shanhaiguan Pass on the Bohai Sea, by
about June 27.
   It took Foster, a part-time actor from Ojai, Calif., years of
effort to win Chinese government approval for his trip, which began
May 11 at the wall's westernmost pass, Jiayuguan, about 950 miles
from Beijing.
   The project bogged down for more than a week when the jeep that
was to accompany him failed to show up and he was forced to fly
back to the capital.
   He started again on May 28 and cycled until June 8, when he had
to travel by jeep and train to Beijing to avoid passing through a
closed military area.
   Foster said of the 1,065 miles he's ridden in 19 days,
three-fourths of that has been on top of the wall. In some places
the wall disintegrated into rubble or disappeared altogether, and
he bicycled in its traces.
   He has been accompanied by a driver and jeep carrying supplies
and two young Chinese staffers from his host organization, the
Institute of Geography, who have taken turns cyling with him.
   The group spent some nights in small towns that hundreds of
years ago housed soldiers guarding the frontier. Other nights they
slept on the wall, sometimes finding families living in the towers
of the wall.
   He said the best part was watching the sun set on the Gobi
Desert after a day's cycling.
   ``The sand, the stars, the cool breeze on a tower that's over
1,000 years old _ that's what it's all about.''

<HEAD>Multi-Million Dollar Pollution Suit Filed Against Eight California
Corporations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN DETTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State and federal officials filed a lawsuit
Monday against eight firms that allegedly dumped cancer-causing DDT
and PCB along the Southern California coast since the 1950s.
   The unprecedented suit, filed in U.S. District Court, is an
attempt to enforce federal provisions requiring polluting companies
to restore damaged marine environments, State Controller Gray Davis
said.
   Damages are estimated to range from $50 to $100 million, said
Michael R. Valentine, an attorney for the state Lands Commission.
   ``Cease and desist orders are no longer enough. Mere cleanup
will no longer be enough. Polluters must now restore the marine
life and habitat they have contaminated,'' Davis said at a news
conference in his Los Angeles office.
   State and federal governments agencies claim the toxic dumping
and discharges have caused serious damage to reproductive health of
the bald eagle, peregrine falcon and sea lion. Recreational and
commercial fisheries have also been harmed, the suit claims.
   ``In the past, the state recovered funds for cleanup of ocean
dumping but there's never been an attempt to collect money to
restore the marine habitat,'' Valentine said.
   The targets of the lawsuit were Montrose Chemical Corp., Atkemix
37 Inc., Stauffer Management Co., ICI American Holdings, Inc.,
Chris-Craft Industries, Inc., Westinghouse Electric Corp., Potlatch
Corp. and Simpson Paper Co.
   ``I have no knowledge on this suit,'' said Maureen Frisch, a
spokeswoman at Simpson's headquarters in San Francisco.
   Unidentified officials at Potlatch in Pomona referred calls to
their San Francisco headquarters where no one was available in a
call made after business hours.
   Officials for the other firms named in the suit could not be
reached in calls made to the East Coast after business hours.
   The suit was filed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, a federal agency that oversees research services
that monitor the nation's atmosphere and seas.
   The suit seeks restoration of offshore environments along an
approximately 20-mile stretch of coast from the northern tip Santa
Monica Bay south to Palos Verdes.
   The action alleges the companies discharged DDT, polychlorinated
biphenyls and other toxic chemicals into the Southern California
coastal marine environment during the last 40 years.
   The insecticide DDT and the PCBs, used in electrical
transformers, are associated with skin diseases and genetic
abnormalities, including diminished reproduction capacity.
   The NOAA is joined by the state Lands Commission, Department of
Fish and Game and the Department of Parks and Recreation.
   The complaint cites the companies for natural resource damages
under a provision in the 1980 Superfund law. Under this law, the
government must first conduct a study to assess the full extent of
environmental damage before they can present their case in court.
   ``There are regulations set up by the NOAA to come up with these
dollar figures. We have set up a combined agency task force to
assess those damages,'' Valentine said.
   Under the Reagan administration, the Superfund law was
restricted to ``human health concerns'' and officials were barred
from invoking it in resource-damage cases.
   The Bush administration has restored $2.5 million cut from the
budget during the Reagan administration to pursue litigation that
would force polluters to restore land and wildlife.
   ``We all pay when the environment is damaged. We should all be
likewise concerned in trying to restore the national marine
habitat,'' Davis said.

   The gunman who strode into an auto
financing company and killed eight people and himself Monday owned
a number of registered weapons and has been linked to two slayings
the day before, police said.
   James Edward Pough, 42, entered the GMAC office in an upscale
office park just south of downtown Monday and began
``indiscriminately shooting employees,'' then turned the weapon on
himself, said Sheriff James McMillan.
   Police said witnesses also identified Pough as the person who
killed a man and a woman in separate shootings early Sunday near
Pough's home here. Police said the Sunday killings were done with
the same rifle as that used Monday.
   In 1971, Pough was charged with manslaughter in the shooting
death of a man; he pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and was
sentenced to five years' probation, court records show.
   The court records show that if Pough obeyed the terms of his
probation, he would not have a criminal record in that case.
   McMillan also said Pough had been arrested in 1968 ``for
dangerously displaying a weapon.''
   Besides the rifle, Pough, an unskilled construction laborer,
also fired a .38-caliber revolver at least once in the Monday
killings.
   ``We also found a 9mm pistol in his car and he has other weapons
that are registered in his name,'' McMillan told reporters.
   Asked where and how Pough got his guns, the sheriff said,
``We're trying to find the answer to that right now. And it's
somewhat ironic since he is a convicted felon.''
   Records show that Pough was married, but neighbors said they had
not seen his wife for some time.
   ``He was a nice person, he came in his house, minded his own
business,'' said Lonnie Webster, who lives nearby.
   Another neighbor who refused to give her name said Pough was ``a
nice guy. There were no misunderstandings, no trouble.''
   Police searched Pough's apartment and emerged with a brown bag,
but refused to say what it contained or whether other weapons were
found.
   Pough had several rifle clips and ammunition for the handgun in
his pockets when he walked into the GMAC office just before 11
a.m., police said.
   GMAC had repossessed Pough's 1988 Pontiac Grand Am in January.
The sheriff said the repossession may not have been the sole motive
for the Monday shootings but offered no further suggestions.
   The Sunday shootings took place near Pough's apartment in the
northwest section of the city.
   Louis Carl Bacon, 39, was shot twice in the chest as he stood on
a corner at 12:50 a.m.; the gunman approached on foot, fired two
shots and fled, said police spokesman Steve Weintraub.
   Doretta Drake, 30, was shot in the head as she walked along a
street at about 1 a.m. Weintrub said the gunman drove by, fired a
shot from his car and drove off.
   The sheriff said at least one of the Sunday shootings stemmed
from arguments over ``services of a prostitute,'' but he did not
elaborate.

<HEAD>NTSB Says Not Sure Inspections Would Catch Crak that Caused Iowa
Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal safety investigators said Monday
current inspection methods might not detect a crack in a jet engine
part like the one that caused last summer's air crash in Iowa that
killed 112 people.
   The National Transportation Safety Board, in formal
recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration, called for
the FAA and the engine manufacturer, General Electric Co., to
develop new inspection methods to detect cracks before they reach
dangerous size.
   The middle, tail-mounted engine of a United Air Lines DC-10
exploded in flight on July 19, 1989, cutting all hydraulic lines of
the aircraft control system. The pilots tried to make an emergency
landing at Sioux City Iowa, but the plane crashed during the
attempt, killing 111 or 296 people on board. One of the injured
later died.
   According to the board, the engine exploded because a crack in
the inner bore of the first-stage rotor disk grew so large that the
rapidly spinning 270-pound disk broke apart, spewing shrapnel-like
pieces throughout the tail area of the aircraft. The disk carries
the 38 blades of the fan on the GE CF6-6 engine.
   The flaw that led to the crack could have been detected if the
final surface inspection by chemical etching had been done on the
rotor in its final shape, rather than an intermediate shape as was
done, the board concluded. It recommended that the FAA require this
etching inspection on the final part shape of all rotating parts
made of titanium.
   The FAA has 90 days to respond to the board's recommendations.
   Following the accident, the FAA ordered the six remaining disks
made from the same ingot of titanium removed from service, leaving
55 made from the same raw material and 165 made before the
manufacturing process was changed in 1971.
   Ultrasonic inspections were ordered for the remaining disks,
including those made by the new process.
   But computer models developed by GE show that a surface crack in
the forward area of the inner bore of the rotor disk ``could
propagate from a size just below the level of detectability to a
critical size in significantly fewer that 500'' flights, using one
ultrasonic inspection method, and the second method ordered to be
used ``may not be any more capable'' of catching those cracks, the
board said.
   The manufacturer calls on users to inspect rotor surfaces under
ultraviolet light after a special wash whenever engines are taken
apart. The board said it was concerned that United's engine passed
such an inspection 760 flight before the accident, and was
concerned that there are no requirements for such inspections at
intervals based on expected crack growth rates.
   The board has not determined why the crack was not discovered at
the ultraviolet inspection.
   The board said it concluded that the FAA's post-crash orders
``taken alone, are inadequate to detect these potentially critical
cracks.'' It called on the FAA to require an alternate inspection
method, such as the use of electrical eddy currents in the part
being inspected.
   The board also called on the FAA to adopt for engines the
assumption now used for aircraft structures when calculating
inspection intervals _ not that the part is flawless originally,
but that it contains a flaw just below the level of detectability.

   Some employees dashed through a back
door and ducked into neighboring buildings after a gunman walked
into their auto loan office and opened fire, killing eight people
before he committed suicide.
   ``They were running literally for their lives,'' said Heather
McRae, a worker at American Transtech, near the General Motors
Acceptance Corp., scene of Monday's carnage.
   Police, GMAC employees and emergency workers described a scene
of horrible violence inside the building, with many of the victims
shot as many as eight times.
   ``It was the worst scene I've seen since I've been in the police
department in terms of gruesomeness,'' said Sgt. Steve Weintraub, a
police spokesman with the department for 16 years.
   James Edward Pough, 42, entered the one-story white stone
building about 10:45 a.m. EDT, shot two customers and then began
firing on employees.
   More than 80 employees worked in the 11,000-square-foot GMAC
office, part of a pine-tree laden office park that also houses
several AT&amp;T subsidiaries, State Farm Insurance and a variety of
small businesses.
   GMAC officials would not allow reporters into the office, but it
was described as having several rows of desks laid out in one large
room _ offering few obstacles to the gunman.
   GMAC employee Richard Langille said office workers dived under
desks when the shooting began.
   ``And then we realized the guy was pointing his gun underneath
people's desk and killing them one by one,'' said Langille. ``I
just saw the bottom of the carpet and just prayed.''
   ``He just shot until he saw no one else to shoot,'' said Sheriff
James McMillan said.
   In addition to the dead, five people were injured and remained
hospitalized late Monday with multiple gunshot wounds.
   ``I had to keep stepping over bodies to give victims CPR,'' said
Sheriff's Office patrolman Steve Dubberly, the second officer on
the scene. ``It's the worst slaughter I've ever seen in my life.''
   The gunman carried a .30-caliber, clip-fed semiautomatic rifle
and a .38-caliber pistol. Most of the shots were fired from the
rifle.
   Daniel Mulvaney, an AT&amp;T worker, was outside on a break when he
heard several gunshots.
   ``We saw people running from the building. One had blood on his
leg and another had blood all over his back,'' Mulvaney said.
   As helicopters and ambulances ferried victims to three local
hospitals, office workers from nearby building stood and watched
from the lawns and parking lots of the well-manicured office park.
   At a building next door to GMAC, police counselors consoled
survivors of the attack and the families of those gunned down.

   John Edward Swindler was electrocuted Monday
night for the 1976 murder of a patrolman, becoming the first
Arkansas inmate to be executed since 1964.
   Swindler, 46, was declared dead at 9:05 p.m by Lincoln County
Coroner Keith Griffin. On Saturday, the Supreme Court had denied
Swindler's final request for a stay of execution.
   The inmate spent his final hours at the penitentiary in
southeast Arkansas with one of his lawyers and his spiritual
adviser, Monsignor James O'Donnell of the Immaculate Conception
Church in North Little Rock.
   After the execution, O'Donnell read a statement from Swindler:
   ``I have no animosity toward anyone. No grudges. I appreciate
the care and love others have shown me and other people on death
row. I hope this brings to light the injustice of capital
punishment and the need to abolish it.''
   Swindler was the 130th inmate put to death in the United States
since 1976, when the U.S. Supreme Court let states resume capital
punishment.
   Arkansas became the 14th state to carry out an execution since
the high court ruling. The last person executed in Arkansas was
Charles Franklin Fields, electrocuted in 1964 for rape.
   Swindler calmly spent his final day in a cell adjoining the
death chamber at Cummins Maximum Security Unit, said prison
spokesman David White.
   Swindler was sentenced to die for the Sept. 24, 1976, murder of
Fort Smith police officer Randy Basnett, who was shot to death at a
filling station when he recognized Swindler, a fugitive from a
double murder in South Carolina.
   ``All I can say is justice has been done,'' said Shanon Howard,
daughter of Basnett's widow, Cindy. ``As far as I'm concerned, it's
over and done and let it lie at that.''
   Swindler, sentenced before Arkansas changed its method of
execution from electrocution to injection, left the choice of
method to prison officials, who opted for the means originally
specified in his sentence, electrocution.
   At the time of Basnett's death, Swindler was wanted for killing
a teen-age couple in South Carolina three days after his release
from the federal prison at Leavenworth, Kan.
   While awaiting execution in Arkansas, he was convicted of those
killings and sentenced to four life terms.
   Arkansas plans another execution soon. Ronald Gene Simmons is
scheduled to die by injection on June 25 for the 1987 killings of
16 people, including 14 of his relatives.

<HEAD>Soviet Legislature Passes Country's First Press Freedom Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet legislature on June 12 passed the
country's first law guaranteeing freedom of the press and creating
broad rights for journalists and publishers.
   The measure, which was passed unanimously by the Supreme Soviet
legislature, also gives any citizen the right to start a media
outlet.
   ``The press and other mass media are free,'' the law begins
bluntly, and ``censorship of the mass media is forbidden.''
   After President Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in 1985 and
introduced the policy of glasnost, or openness, political pressure
on the Soviet media began to lighten, but there was still no legal
protection from interference.
   Technically, freedom of the press is guaranteed by a declaration
in the Soviet Constitution, but the new measure was the first law
laying out detailed guarantees of press freedoms, the Tass news
agency reported.
   The law establishes procedures for creating media outlets and
specifies journalists' rights. They include the right to attend
meetings and be present at the scene of disasters, the right to
refuse to prepare reports that go against personal convictions and
the right to hold interviews with officials.
   The provision giving any individual the right to establish a
media outlet created the sharpest debate in the Supreme Soviet,
Tass reported.
   The new law forbids publication of state secrets, but Tass said
penalties would be imposed on the official who leaked them rather
than the journalist who reported them.
   It also forbids slander and ``use of the mass media to interfere
in citizens' private lives, infringement on their honor and
dignity.''

<HEAD>Publisher Says New Paper Making Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kansas City's new evening newspaper
is making money after only a month of publication and will begin
limited home delivery in the suburbs, the tabloid's owner said June
14.
   The Kansas City Evening News, published Monday through Friday,
is selling an average of about 15,000 copies at 50 cents each, said
owner Steve Rose.
   ``That's about what I had projected for circulation _ I would
have been very disappointed if we hadn't made money off of that,''
said Rose, president of Sun Publications, a family-owned string of
suburban weekly newspapers.
   He did not disclose how much money the newspaper was making.
   When he launched the tabloid May 14, with startup costs he said
were just $1 million, Rose estimated that a combination of small
staff, relatively small circulation and no home delivery would keep
costs low.
   But he said June 14 he will start limited home delivery in two
suburbs, Overland Park and Leawood, Kan.
   City ordinances prevent the Evening News from being sold on
street corners in those towns, he said. Rather than go to court, he
decided to begin home delivery there later this month.
   In other parts of the Kansas City area, the Evening News will
continue to be sold only at street corners, newsracks and stores,
said Rose, who spoke in a telephone interview from San Antonio,
where he was attending a newspaper conference.
   Analysts had predicted the paper would have a difficult time in
a city dominated by a morning paper, The Kansas City Star, with
circulation of about 300,000. Last March, The Kansas City Times was
merged with The Kansas City Star because of declining circulation.
   Rose said low costs would help him survive.
   ``We could still sell down to as little as 10,000 (copies) and
make a profit,'' he said. ``Of course, I hope we don't do that.''
   The paper, which averages about 32 pages a day, contains mostly
wire service reports on national and international news and sports.
   It has four editorial employees and shares a building, printing
press and advertising and circulation staff with Sun Publications.

<HEAD>PBS Considering Free Air Time for 1992 Presidential Candidates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Public Broadcasting Service is looking at
ways to provide 1992 presidential candidates and the major
political parties free air time beyond the normal news coverage to
present their views, PBS President Bruce Christensen said June 17.
   ``What we're looking for is the way to increase the political
dialogue,'' Christensen said in a telephone interview from Dallas,
where the PBS board of directors was meeting.
   Christensen said specifics had not been worked out, though
possibilities include several ideas recommended June 15 to top PBS
officials by the John and Mary Markle Foundation of New York.
   The foundation has offered to contribute $5 million of the
estimated $15 million to $20 million that the project would cost.
   Developed by Alvin H. Perlmutter, an independent television
producer, the Markle study recommends that PBS offer free air time
in blocks ranging from 2{ minutes to 15 minutes to the presidential
candidates or the political parties.
   Perlmutter, who has worked for PBS and NBC, recommended creating
a ``Voters Channel'' production company to prepare expanded
political programming for PBS stations that also would include
``character and competence'' profiles of presidential candidates
and an exploration of their debates.
   Regularly scheduled one-hour programs would be broadcast during
September and October 1992, with half-hour programs airing daily
the week before the November general election.
   The report also recommended that the programs include segments
examining political ads and party activities in the campaign and
the media's coverage of it. And it called for a segment in which
voters could voice their views on the candidates and the issues.

<HEAD>Journalists Name Computer Maker in Injury Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight journalists filed a $270 million lawsuit
against a computer maker on June 15, contending they suffered
disabling injuries from using the company's word processors in
newsrooms.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, charged
that Atex Publishing Systems, a subsidiary of the Eastman Kodak
Co., was negligent in marketing the computers and had failed to
warn users of the dangers or to develop substitute systems.
   It also alleged that the company ``ignored, suppressed or
disregarded'' medical studies about ``the causal relationship
between the repetitive use of computer systems and cumulative
trauma disorders.''
   The journalists, each seeking $20 million in punitive damages
and $10 million in compensatory damages, included two from Newsday,
two from American Banker and individual staffers at The Associated
Press, New York Newsday, The Village Voice and Discount Store News.
   Three spouses also asked $10 million each for loss of
companionship, bringing the total number of plaintiffs to 11.
   None of the employers were named as defendants. Ruth Marcus, an
attorney for the plaintiffs, said New York state law provides that
workers cannot sue employers for work-related injuries but must
pursue such claims through workmen's compensation.
   Eastman Kodak spokesman John Labella said the company had no
comment because its lawyers had not seen the suit.
   It was the second lawsuit filed in New York in less than a month
against the company, which manufactures computer systems designed
for use in newsrooms. Three reporters and an editor at New York
Newsday demanded $40 million in a negligence suit filed June 4 in
Manhattan Supreme Court.
   The most recent filing alleged the eight journalists ``developed
and suffered severe, permanent and disabling cumulative trauma
disorders, as well as psychological injuries,'' from repeated use
of the Atex video display terminals.
   It said cumulative trauma disorders included ``repetitive strain
injuries, musculoskeletal and nerve disorders, upper extremity pain
syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome, tendinitis and other injuries to
the upper extremities.''
   The eight journalists named as plaintiffs are: Susan Harrigan of
New York Newsday, Laurie Garrett and Sandra Peddie of Newsday,
Martha Gioumousis of Discount Store News, Kathy Silberger of The
Village Voice, Wendy Grover and David Neustadt of American Banker
and Anne Buckley of The Associated Press.
   The other plaintiffs are Harrigan's husband, Peter Benjaminson;
Peddie's husband, Brian Quinn, and Neustadt's wife, Maisie McAdoo.

<HEAD>Media Duped by Bogus Elizabeth Taylor Story</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hoaxer tricked the news media into running
a bogus story about Elizabeth Taylor on June 10 by gaining access
to messages left with a public relations company's answering
service.
   The story, distributed worldwide by The Associated Press and
United Press International, said Miss Taylor was romantically
involved with a 23-year-old man and had just undergone surgery.
   ``It is a hoax,'' said Miss Taylor's publicist, Chen Sam. ``I
have contacted Miss Taylor's attorneys and we are going to conduct
an investigation. It is apparently somebody using my (telephone)
service.''
   Ms. Sam's New York City public relations firm was the sole media
link during Miss Taylor's nine-week hospitalization for pneumonia
at St. John's Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica.
   The Sam organization discouraged reporters from calling St.
John's about Miss Taylor and instructed the hospital's public
relations staff not to answer reporters' questions. Under
California privacy law, hospitals must abide by the wishes of
patients who don't want information released about them.
   The AP office in Los Angeles had placed calls to the hospital
and to Chen Sam and Associates after receiving a message Sunday
from an AP affiliate in England, the Press Association. Editors at
the British domestic news agency had heard Miss Taylor had
undergone another operation and wanted a story.
   The hoaxer said Miss Taylor underwent an abdominal biopsy and
was expected to be released from the hospital within two weeks on
the arm of Julian Lee Hobbs of Lake Orion, Mich., described as Miss
Taylor's boyfriend.
   The hospital spokeswoman was unavailable for comment. When the
reporter called New York, he was connected to Ms. Sam's answering
service and left a message.
   A short time later, a woman returned the call, saying she was
Lisa Flowers from Chen Sam and Associates. She then gave the
reporter the bogus information about Miss Taylor's romantic
involvement and the surgery.
   The hoaxer also provided the same story to UPI and City News
Service, a metropolitan Los Angeles wire service.
   The AP reporter, in an effort to verify the authenticity of the
source, later placed a second call to Ms. Sam's answering service,
leaving a message for Lisa Flowers. The answering service operator
accepted that message without question.
   Later, an AP reporter placed a third call to Ms. Sam's answering
service. A woman identifying herself as Ms. Sam returned that call
and verified the identity of ``Ms. Flowers'' and the story she had
told.
   Ms. Sam said no one from her organization had talked to
reporters. She said a woman involved in the hoax had telephoned her
answering service and was given the publicist's messages after
somehow providing proper coded identification to the switchboard.
   ``It was all very cleverly done,'' Ms. Sam said. ``It was done
on a Sunday when we weren't around. I can't understand how they got
the code. I've had to change the entire system here.''

<HEAD>Times of London Reluctantly Enters Modern Era With Style Changes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The venerable Times of London has revised its
Victorian-era style guide to include such brash and contemporary
language as the title ``Ms.''
   Editor Simon Jenkins tried to break the news gently to readers
of the 205-year-old newspaper, who tend to regard its
eccentricities as a national treasure on the order of Big Ben.
   ``The mirror that a newspaper holds up to the world is
constantly smudged with jargon, bad usage and verbosity,'' Jenkins
wrote June 12. ``A style guide is a periodic cleansing of that
mirror.''
   The Times style guide, introduced at the turn of the century,
was last revamped in the mid-1960s.
   There were regular updates but the guide remained ``terribly
restrictive and quite Victorian,'' said literary editor Philip
Howard, who helped write the new one.
   The old style guide was replete with arcane treasures such as
The Times' singular spelling of Mikhail S. ``Gorbachov.'' Its
rendering of the Soviet leader's name was based on its
transliteration of the Cyrillic letters.
   ``Our Russian specialists know that our spelling is better, but
if the rest of the world spells it another way, ours looks very
odd,'' Howard said. ``We're right, but we're wrong.''
   So from now on, it's Gorbachev.
   Under the old style, The Times referred to Leonardo da Vinci's
masterpiece as the ``Monna Lisa,'' to show it was derived from
``Madonna.'' It will now be ``Mona Lisa.''
   From now on, ``Ms.'' will be automatically used in Times news
columns for American women, and for others if they request it.
   The Times is also dropping courtesy titles on first reference _
something certain to disappoint readers who enjoyed such prim
designations as Mr. Ringo Starr.
   On subsequent reference, most people continue to get a title,
except criminals, artists, athletes and the long dead.
   The new guide also has a blacklist _ words that ``slip into
journalese as a form of obfuscation and circumlocution and
gobbledygook,'' Howard said.
   These include: problem, provision, very, issue, accommodate,
crisis, interesting, and situation. Especially ``crisis
situation.'' And ``probe.''
   ``Words like probe should be confined to stories about
surgeons,'' he said.

<HEAD>Media Lawyers Say Release of Outtakes Would Threaten News
Gathering</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Media lawyers told Maine's highest court
June 14 that the release of unaired portions of a videotaped
interview would threaten news gathering.
   A prosecutor who wants the tape said she is not trying to
restrict press freedom.
   The Maine Supreme Judicial Court heard arguments on an appeal by
WCSH-TV of Portland, which is challenging an order to surrender
tapes of its 12-minute interview last February with Biddeford
Police Commissioner Denis Letellier.
   Only about 2{ minutes of the tape was broadcast. York County
District Attorney Mary Tousignant wants to present the remaining
footage to the grand jury. That panel is looking into complaints
that Letellier used his position to try to get a motor vehicle
charge against his son reduced.
   Attorney John Paterson, representing the station, argued that
the Superior Court erred when it refused to quash the subpoena
without considering the constitutional issues. Those included fears
that release of the tapes could inhibit potential news sources and
have a chilling effect on the way news is gathered and edited.
   ``The news gathering process itself is a part of the very
freedom of the press that the First Amendment protects,'' said
Paterson. He asserted there was a ``qualified privilege''
protecting unpublished material.
   Tousignant said there was no basis to withhold the tapes because
Letellier's statement was made in public and without any claim to
confidentiality.

<HEAD>Feminist Groups Angered Over Current Issue of Esquire Magazine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Feminist groups announced a boycott June 13
against Esquire magazine, saying they're outraged by an article in
the latest issue titled ``Your Wife: An Owner's Manual.''
   ``We find it to be literally an expression of the degradation of
women,'' said Tammy Bruce, president of the local chapter of the
National Organization for Women.
   ``It puts us into a subhuman level, places women into a thing
mode,'' Bruce said in a telephone interview.
   The June edition of Esquire devotes several articles to wives
and lists ``The Twelve Virtues of the Perfect Wife,'' which
describes the ideal woman as obedient, thrifty and reverent.
   NOW and The Feminist Majority urged members and supporters to
mount a letter-writing and telephone campaign against Esquire. The
groups also urged subscribers to cancel and advertisers to withdraw
their ads.
   Calls to the New York-based magazine seeking comment were met
with busy signals after the campaign was announced.

<HEAD>Sun-Times Drops Columnist for Use of Previously Published Material</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Sun-Times announced June 12 it was
dropping a California-based columnist on aging because portions of
two columns were taken almost verbatim from articles in The New
York Times.
   In a bylined, Page 3 article headlined ``An apology to our
readers,'' Sun-Times Editor Dennis A. Britton wrote that he had the
``embarrassing and sad duty'' of disclosing that portions of two
weekly ``Age Wave'' columns by Ken Dychtwald had not been original.
   In a statement that appeared in the same edition, Dychtwald said
the material was used accidentally.
   ``I deeply regret these two errors and am appreciative of your
calling them to my attention so that I might publicly offer these
apologies and corrections,'' Dychtwald wrote.
   A portion of his Feb. 11 column was subtitled ``Growing Old
Happily'' and contained eight paragraphs taken almost verbatim from
a Jan. 16 article in The New York Times by Daniel Goleman headlined
``Men at 65: New Findings on Well-Being,'' Britton said.
   The second questioned column was published in the Sunday
Sun-Times on April 22, and was headlined ```Wrongful life' lawsuit
raises painful, complex questions.'' Britton wrote that substantial
portions of the five-paragraph item appeared March 1 in The New
York Times in an article by David Margolick. That front-page story
ran under the headline ``Patient's Lawsuit Says Saving Life Ruined
It,'' according to Britton.
   Dychtwald wrote that in the Feb. 11 column, he ``mistakenly
believed it was appropriate to cite only the original source'' of
publicly circulated information included in The New York Times
article.
   Dychtwald said he was on leave after the birth of his son when
his staff ``inadvertently failed to credit The New York Times as
the primary source'' for some of the material in the April 22
column.
   The Sun-Times investigation was prompted by a reader who noticed
the similarities between the April 22 Dychtwald column and the
Margolick piece, Britton said, adding that a library search
revealed the other problem.
   The Sun-Times purchased the column directly from Age Wave Inc.,
Emeryville, Calif., said Penny Williams-Martin, Britton's secretary.
   Hearst Entertainment King Features Syndicate also distributes a
column under the ``Age Wave'' name, but it is not the same column
supplied to the Sun-Times, said Merry Clark, director of editorial
projects for the New York-based syndicate.
   The King-distributed column is produced by a ghost writer under
Dychtwald's byline, Clark said. The column Dychtwald has long
written for the Sun-Times was too Chicago-oriented for a national
audience, she said.

<HEAD>Former Reporter Sues Oregonian</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former sports reporter and columnist
filed suit against The Oregonian on June 12, claiming the newspaper
broke his employment contract by firing him last year.
   David B. Kahn, who covered professional basketball, is seeking
$200,000 in lost wages and benefits and $10,000 for costs incurred
finding other work. He also is asking for $29,869 in overtime pay,
and wants to recover attorney fees and court costs.
   In his five-page lawsuit, Kahn claimed he received no warning of
any improper conduct before he was fired in October 1989 after five
years at the paper. The suit also claims he was not paid for
overtime work.
   Fred A. Stickel, president and publisher of the Oregonian
Publishing Co., said he could not comment specifically on Kahn's
allegations.
   ``The only comment I have with regard to this since it's in
litigation is we don't have many discharges around here,'' Stickel
said. ``The few that we do have are generally for gross
misconduct.''
   Kahn now writes a sports column for the Willamette Week
newspaper in Portland and hosts a local radio sports call-in show.

<HEAD>Editor Says Report of His Quitting Was Wrong</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The founder and editor of Street News, the
newspaper sold by the homeless, said June 12 that reports of his
quitting stemmed from a misunderstanding.
   ``I was just taking a few days off. I was burned out,'' said
Hutchinson Persons, citing an 80-hour work week and other pressures
of the job.
   He said he returned to work on June 11, two days after newspaper
spokesman Jeffrey Sussman reported his departure.
   Sussman has since said he got the information from ``people who
in his absence said he resigned. I think they thought he really had
quit.''
   Asked about a state investigation of his newspaper's finances,
Persons said he had provided the attorney general's office with
information it had requested, but he knew nothing about the status
of the inquiry.
   Press reports have quoted unnamed sources as saying Street News
employees told the attorney general that as much as $250,000 was
unaccounted for.
   Accountings of Street News' income and spending have been
printed in the last two editions of the bimonthly newspaper,
Persons said.

35 has ratified a new three-year contract with The Baltimore Sun
Co. that calls for weekly wage increases ranging from $20 to $36 in
each year for 875 employees.
   The vote June 14 was 290-69 in favor of the contract that covers
employees in the news, commercial, clerical and building
departments.
   The guild was the sixth and final union representing employees
at The Sun and The Evening Sun to approve new labor agreements.
   Top minimum paid to reporters _ the minimum salary paid to the
most experienced reporters _ would rise from the current contract's
$790 a week to $826 a week this month, and to $898 a week in June
1993.

<HEAD>Journal-American Employees Ratify New Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELLEVUE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employees of the Bellevue
Journal-American newspaper reluctantly accepted a new contract
offering annual pay raises of about 2.5 percent through 1993.
   ``It wasn't a happy vote. People just felt they had no choice
but to take it,'' said Art Joyner, administrative officer for the
Pacific Northwest Newspaper Guild.
   The contract was accepted June 14 on a 23-18 vote, which also
ended a lawsuit stemming from the old contract, the newspaper said.
   The guild had filed a federal lawsuit in April charging that the
paper was not deducting union dues from employee paychecks.
   Basic pay increases will be in steps, starting with 2 percent on
July 1, followed by 1 percent Jan. 1, and continuing on that
schedule until April 1993.

   The Omaha World-Herald is donating $150,000
to help start an electronic index of its clip files to be made
available to the public.
   The Douglas County Historical Society installed eight computers
on June 13 for its ``Living Morgue.''
   Roger Reeves, curator of the historical society, said the clips,
which fill three rooms, will first have to be preserved.
   ``When we first got them, they were crunched into small
envelopes. We'll unfold them and put them into acid-free files to
deter any more aging. Those that are too delicate will be
photocopied on acid-free paper.''
   During the second phase, Reeves and a staff of five will enter
brief summaries of each story into the computers, which will be
accessible to colleges and public libraries statewide for a fee.

<HEAD>Striking Journalists Publish Own Newspaper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Journalists stood on street corners hawking
a newspaper they published on their own after launching Norway's
first newspaper strike in 44 years.
   The 32-page tabloid Avisa, the Norwegian word for newspaper,
appeared on June 11, a day after wage negotiations collapsed. It
competed with regular newspapers that succeeded in publishing thin
editions that day.
   The Norwegian Union of Journalists had ordered strikes at eight
major newspapers and the national news service NTB. Norway's
publishers association responded by locking out reporters from 57
other newspapers.
   In all, about 2,000 journalists were on strike or locked out.
   Employers offered less than half the journalists' demand of a
4.57 percent increase on their $34,460 average annual salary,
reports said.

<HEAD>Serbian Journalists Complain of Bias in Belgrade TV News</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Independent journalists' groups in
Serbia complained of bias in Belgrade TV coverage of an
anti-Communist rally and demanded criminal charges be brought
against the Communist director.
   ``We consider that television reports before, during and after
the opposition rally ... represent a drastic violation of
journalistic ethics,'' said a statement released June 15 by
Belgrade Television's independent employees union.
   More than 30,000 people from the one-party state of Serbia, the
largest of Yugoslavia's six republics, demonstrated in Belgrade on
June 13 demanding free elections and an end to Communist rule in
their state.
   The main rally ended peacefully, but police later used clubs to
disperse demonstrators who went to the TV station to demand
coverage of their demands and the resignation of Dusan Mitevic, a
Communist official appointed to head the state-run TV last year.
   Belgrade TV and Serbia's state-run press have described the
rally as ``a betrayal of Serbia'' and its participants as ``fascist
hooligans.'' They demand a purge of reporters from Belgrade's
independent radio station, which gave comprehensive coverage to the
event.
   A similar protest about coverage was made against the newspaper
Politika, an outlet of Serbia's ruling Communists, by 37 Politika
reporters. Its story June 14 on the rally was headlined, ``The
Anti-Serbian Gathering Was Unsuccessful.''

<HEAD>Report: U.S. Lags in Development of High-Definition TV</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States could be damaging its world
position in high technology by falling behind in development of
high-definition television, congressmen say.
   ``The message is clear: Congress and the administration, get
moving,'' said Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif. ``We must recognize the
huge significance of HDTV to our economy.''
   A report issued June 12 by the Office of Technology Assessment,
a research arm of Congress, said the United States lags behind
Japan in development of HDTV. ``Japan considers HDTV to be an
important step into the future information society,'' it said.
   High-definition television promises motion picture-quality
images and compact disc-quality sound. Proponents say its
development could help re-energize the U.S. electronics and
computer industries.

<HEAD>Study Says Cable TV Rates Rising at Twice the Inflation Rate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Basic cable television rates climbed at twice
the rate of inflation last year, according to a report released
June 14.
   The prices for the lowest-cost basic service and most popular
cable services in 1989 increased an average of 10 percent, from
$14.50 to $15.95, the congressional General Accounting Office said.
The total average cable bill went up 5 percent, from $25 to $26.36.
   The inflation rate was 4 percent to 5 percent for the year, said
GAO, the investigative arm of Congress.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., who requested the GAO survey,
said the results showed that Congress ``must consider legislation
that will rein in the renegade operators'' in the cable industry.
   The National Cable Television Association said the GAO report
``reconfirms that the average cable subscriber's monthly bill
increased at about the rate of inflation in 1989, and is still
further evidence that cable rate increases have leveled off.'' It
said cable ``is still a very good buy.''

   Ted Turner apologized on his own Cable News
Network for calling Christianity ``a religion for losers.''
   Turner, appearing on CNN's ``Crossfire'' program June 12, said
he was speaking off the top of his head when he made the comment.
   ``I want to officially apologize to all the Christians for
saying that,'' Turner said. ``That was a very uncalled-for
statement. At one time or another, I've offended just about
everybody. I was making a talk off the cuff when that just popped
out, and I feel very sorry for it.''
   Turner met earlier in the day with Chinese student leader Shen
Tong, 21, who was offended by something Turner said last month.
   Shen said he was unable to persuade Turner to lend support to
his country's democracy movement.
   ``He don't want to be involved. He don't want to contribute,''
Shen said. Shen sought the meeting after Turner said the Chinese
government ``felt forced'' to quell democracy protests with
military strength that left hundreds of demonstrators dead.

<HEAD>NBC Plans To Implement Union-Rejected Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC said June 11 it will implement a proposed
four-year contract rejected in May by members of the network's
major union.
   John Krieger, a spokesman for the National Association of
Broadcast Employees and Technicians, said the union still hoped to
get changes in the contract before the network puts it into effect
June 20.
   The union, which says it has 2,373 members at NBC and NBC-owned
operations, struck NBC in 1987 in a bitter walkout that lasted 17
weeks.
   No walkout is imminent in the current dispute. Union members
have not taken a strike authorization vote and are continuing to
work.
   The main issues are job security and jurisdiction, Krieger said.
The majority of NABET's 1,300 members are engineers and
technicians. The union also represents newswriters, couriers,
building maintenance employees and operations directors.
   NBC says its offer establishes parity with union contracts in
force at CBS and ABC.

   Military police confiscated video from an
``Inside Edition'' television crew taping penned dolphins at a base
where the mammals are trained as guards for nuclear submarines, the
Navy said June 13.
   Reporter Craig Rivera, brother of talk-show host Geraldo Rivera,
two other crew members and Richard O'Barry, best known as a trainer
for the ``Flipper'' television series, were detained briefly June
12 for allegedly crossing into a restricted zone at Key West Naval

   ``They were warned off and in fact crossed the lines anyway,''
Ensign Robin Perkins said. ``They were apprehended because they
were in a restricted naval area.''
   No charges were filed, but she said a report on the incident
will be referred to the U.S. attorney's office for review.
   O'Barry said there were no signs saying the area was off-limits.
``We were told to get out of there and then ordered to hand over
the film. We were surrounded by 15 Navy frogmen.''
   He said the same thing happened last week to a crew for ABC's
``20@20'' newsmagazine show.
   Marcy Baron, a publicist for the show in New York, said Rivera
was obeying the law and did not violate journalistic ethics.

His company bought ABC in 1986.
   Introduced at the center's annual awards luncheon by Ted Koppel,
anchor of ABC's ``Nightline,'' Murphy told his audience that to be
a leader in broadcasting, a company must be a leader in its news
operations.
   Broadcasters must view news ``as a special responsibility,''
said Murphy, who noted the fierce competition among the three
networks in news.
   ``The fun of this competition is that we all fight for the high
ground,'' he said, adding that ``I for one would be pleased to be
associated'' with the news operations of any of the three major
networks.
   The Center for Communications, founded in 1980, is a non-profit
organization supported by print and broadcast companies.
   It holds seminar and teleconferences for college students
interested in all areas of communications, from journalism to
public relations.
   Previous winners of its achievement award include CBS founder
William S. Paley, Washington Post Publisher Katharine Graham, and
former NBC board Chairman Grant Tinker.

   Herb Caen said he has stopped writing Sunday columns for the San
Francisco Chronicle as of June 17, taking advantage of his contract
with the newspaper to cut back to five columns a week. ``Talking
about how great old San Francisco was exposed me as the crank and
grump I was becoming ... the Baghdad-by-the-Bay stuff ... wore thin
as the city changed.'' ... Beetle Bailey, the lazy but lovable GI
who has stumbled through comic pages for the past 40 years, finally
won an admiring salute June 14 from the U.S. Army. In a Flag Day
ceremony at the Pentagon, cartoonist Mort Walker received a framed
``certificate of appreciation for patriotic civilian service,'' and
said he couldn't believe it was finally happening: ``As hard as it
is to find anything in the Pentagon, they finally found a sense of
humor.''

   Five Central American presidents have
fired the first salvo in their war on poverty, ending a three-day
summit with an agreement to form a Central American Economic
Community.
   ``We will never see peace in Central America while hunger exists
in thousands of homes,'' said Costa Rican President Rafael Calderon.
   The presidents _ all elected civilians _ agreed in two accords
Sunday night to try to mesh the region's economies. They pledged
coordinated action on foreign trade and debt, on rebuilding
infrastructures, on agricultural and industrial policy and
attracting investment.
   Calderon said the region, deeply scarred by a decade of civil
strife, needs international support.

   A roadside vendor sells a watermelon for cash.
A doctor treats a plumber in exchange for a faucet repair. A giant
corporation exaggerates a deduction. And the federal tax gap gets
bigger.
   The gap between federal income taxes owed and paid voluntarily
is expected to swell to $100 billion this year and to as high as
$127 billion two years from now. That does not include uncounted
billions more taxes owed on income from illegal sources.
   Although the dollar figure grows, the tax gap is about the same
17 percent of taxes owed that it was when the Internal Revenue
Service began keeping the statistics in 1973.
   Viewed another way, individuals and businesses pay about 83
percent of their income taxes without further prodding by the IRS
and avoid the rest chiefly by under-reporting income and
overstating deductions.

   Late this week, budget talks between the Bush
administration and Congress should evolve from preliminary,
technical discussions into hard bargaining with election-year
politics and billions of dollars at stake.
   But none of the participants pretends to know what will happen.
   ``I wouldn't hazard a guess,'' said one, Senate Budget Committee
Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn. ``These things can go on for so
long, and then suddenly as if by magic you seem to reach a critical
mass and then there's an agreement.''
   After five weeks and eight private sessions, the Democratic and
Republican sides agree that somewhere between $45 billion and $60
billion in new taxes and spending cuts are needed for fiscal 1991,
which starts Oct. 1.

   On the same square where police broke
up an anti-Communist sit-in last week, protesters regrouped to
demand the ouster of President-elect Ion Iliescu and faced police
for hours in a tense standoff.
   But force was not used against the demonstrators _
President-elect Ion Ilescu's most recent strong-arm tactics have
cost his government Western aid _ and most dispersed quietly Sunday
night after the government promised dialogue.
   Some protesters remained on University Square today, but traffic
was again allowed to pass through the plaza. At its largest on
Sunday, the crowd had numbered several hundred.
   ``Down with Iliescu!'' protesters yelled. ``Iliescu should be
put on trial!'' About 80 soldiers with submachine guns and
nightsticks stood on the edge of the square and two buses full of
police were parked nearby.

   The heirs to the long-ruling Communists
today appeared well on their way toward winning control of
Parliament after run-off elections, but the capital was firmly in
opposition hands.
   Bulgaria's ruling Socialists would be the only reformed
Communists to hold onto power in an Eastern Europe where
authoritarian rule gave way to popular elections this year after
decades of Soviet domination.
   The 400-seat Parliament _ the first freely elected legislature
in Bulgaria in 58 years _ is expected, however, to have a strong
opposition.
   The Socialists won 28 of the 81 seats at stake in Sunday's
voting, according to partial results reported by state-run Sofia
radio, giving them a total of 200 seats with results from 25 races
still unannounced.

   People whose homes and belongings were

have to put their lives back together largely without benefit of
insurance.
   Few people in this coal-mining and steel-making area along the
Wegee and Pipe creeks carried flood insurance, and homeowners'
insurance will not cover damage from Thursday's flood, residents
and insurers said.
   Rescue workers, meanwhile, held out little hope that any of the
16 people listed as missing were alive.
   ``It's just been too long. I don't think there's anybody alive
out there. You can't swim out there that long in the Ohio River,''
said Chuck Vogt, Belmont County coroner's investigator.

   Maurice White is thinking a lot about the past
these days. He has someone checking out his family tree _ he knows
his great-grandmother lived in New Orleans, and he wants to go back
further, much further.
   Musically, it's the same story. Earth, Wind &amp; Fire's new album,
``Heritage,'' is another kind of family tree, the tone set by
``Takin' Chances'' and its refrain of ``No risk, No gain.''
   Sly Stone is on it, so is M.C. Hammer, and tributes are paid to
Fats Waller and Charlie Parker. The music features jazz, funk,
rhythm and blues and rap, with time out for one of Philip Bailey's
sweet ballads.
   ``The album was a germ in my mind,'' White, the band's founder
and producer, said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles.
``It's very interesting watching it evolve and come to fruition. It
starts as an idea, and all of a sudden it's a giant thing.
   ``I was thinking, first of all musical heritage, the things we
had drawn from. And we wanted to bring to our fans' attention
things to appreciate, things to be proud of.''
   The LP has 17 songs and runs for an over an hour. The title
track features rappers The Boys. Hammer, whose album ``Please
Hammer Don't Hurt `Em'' has topped the charts, gives raps on two
songs, ``Wanna Be the Man'' and ``For the Love of You,''
   Stone contributes his best James Brown shout to ``Good Time,''
and the brief instrumental ``Interlude: Bird'' features a saxophone
solo influenced by Parker.
   ``The things that really thrill me about the record was having
the opportunity to work with other artists who I had admired from a
distance. Sly Stone I really had only met casually. He was one of
my early influences, he and Ray Charles,'' White said.
   ``My son, Kibran, listens to M.C. all the time _ besides being
hip to what's going on in the streets, M.C. has a positive message
for young people. So it was a way of bringing back two eras
together and getting back on the cutting edge.''
   This is actually the second edition of Earth, Wind &amp; Fire.
White, a former session musician at Chess Records, formed the first
one in the late 1960s; it soon broke up. So White gave it another
try: same name, new members.
   ``I made sure that they understood it was going to be a long,
rocky road,'' recalled White, who recruited Bailey, brother Verdine
White on bass and six others. ``I was looking for people who had
dedication and integrity to the music. Growth takes a long time. I
still have growing pains.''
   Originally a little known jazz group, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire didn't
click until 1975 and their sixth album, ``That's the Way of the
World.'' The fast-paced chant ``Shining Star'' was a No. 1 single,
its story of every man's uniqueness an update of Stone's
``Everybody Is a Star.'' It appealed to just about all audiences.
   Earth, Wind &amp; Fire has since had six double platinum albums and
won seven Grammys, but White isn't satisfied with the band's
reputation as a ``crossover'' act. Listen to him and you wonder
about the chorus of the new album's title song: ``Just be proud of
your land, where your blood comes from.''
   European audiences are more challenging than American ones, he
says. In the states, they just want to hear the hits _ including
``Boogie Wonderland,'' ``September'' and ``Let's Groove'' _ while
Europeans respond to White's more ambitious outlook.
   ``I think in a lot of cases we have been logged as being a black
group musically and that's it. They look at their faces, and say,
`They're black and therefore they do this kind of music.'
   ``In Europe, they're more open to the music and more open to the
culture. They're inquisitive. They don't understand anything about
the culture and so they try to investigate and have an open mind.''
   White and the band push on, surviving a temporary split in 1984,
and adjusting to a music scene that never stops changing. ``We'll
go on `till we drop,'' he says. A recent visit to the Berlin Wall
reminds him how much there is to write about, and thoughts of their
world tour make him anxious to get back on the front line.
   ``The tour will be about musical heritage, artistic heritage,
racial heritage. We have something now which I think the whole
globe is gravitating to, and that is the world beat,'' he said.
   ``With the opening up of all these different countries in
Eastern Europe, we have a lot more people to reach. What we're
gearing up towards is a great world community.''

human being is the ability to bear present frustrations in the
interests of longer purposes.'' _ Helen Merrell Lynd, American
sociologist and educator (1896-1982).

<HEAD>Flag Burning a Ready-Made Issue for Political Ads</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When there is a candidate to sell and 30
seconds to do it, the emotional case for a constitutional amendment
against flag burning fits the format. That's likely to make it a
high-intensity issue, at least until the fireworks season is over.
   It may turn out to be too hot not to cool down before the
congressional and state elections on Nov. 6. This is the second
time around, and the fervor doesn't seem quite so intense as a year
ago, when the Supreme Court's decision to overrule state laws
against flag burning took the political establishment by surprise.
   Still, the issue is back after the high court last week struck
down a federal flag burning statute. It could be significant in a
close race in which an incumbent House member or senator votes
against the flag amendment. The political risk is on that side of
the issue; nobody ever lost an election by waving the American flag.
   And the flag burning vote is made to order for 30-second
campaign ads on television, the shorthand in which candidates make
their case nowadays. That side of the issue can be depicted
visually, with pictures planting the idea that a candidate opposed
to amending the Constitution sides with the demonstrators who burn
flags.
   The other side of the argument is a matter of words and
explanation. It takes some time to tell.
   That's why candidates are nervous.
   When Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., the minority leader, was asked
whether he would try to make the amendment vote a question of
patriotism, he said no, ``But I might make it a 30-second spot.''
   Nobody in Congress favors flag burning. But a Republican
campaign official demonstrated the way the issue can be cast that
way in a campaign.
   ``If your opponent is for flag burning, he's got to go through a
very sophisticated explanation of why he is,'' said Ed Rollins of
the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee.
   President Bush, pushing the amendment he has advocated for a
year, said it was an American, not a partisan, issue. ``I hope it
will be out of the way by the time of the election,'' he said as he
urged approval of the amendment before the Fourth of July.
   But Republican campaigners will be using the roll call votes on
the flag amendment against Democrats who vote no. Bush will be
campaigning for Republican candidates this summer and fall.
   And he's had ample practice with the flag issue. He used it
adroitly against Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in the 1988
presidential campaign over the governor's veto of a bill requiring
that teachers lead the pledge of allegiance in their classrooms.
   ``We're going to go out and tell the American people this is how
people voted on this issue,'' said Dole. He also said explanations
of a vote against the amendment would fare better at bar
association meetings than with real people.
   It is not a party-line issue, but Bush and the Republicans are
the main force for an amendment, while Democratic leaders of the
Senate and House are opposed. There are dissenters on both sides.
   Sen. George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said the
issue is not the flag, but whether the Bill of Rights should be
amended. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington said there
should be no tampering with the First Amendment, the free-speech
guarantee that was the basis of both court decisions against laws
that banned flag burning.
   Those are intellectual arguments, and they take time to express.
The argument for the amendment is short and simple, almost a
slogan: protect the flag.
   ``I think most Americans, the real people out there, are on our
side,'' Dole said. ``We might lose with some of the academicians
and maybe some of the constitutional lawyers and some of the
liberal politicians ....''
   The early House and Senate head counts are said to point to
close votes, because it will take the approval of two-thirds of
those voting in each branch to approve the amendment and send it on
to the state legislatures. Three fourths of the states would have
to approve to a flag-burning ban into the Constitution.
   After the first court ruling, on June 21, 1989, the estimates
were that an amendment would have cleared Congress easily.
Democratic leaders contained the issue, and the political anger
behind it, by drafting a statute to ban flag desecration. That put
a flag vote on the record without a constitutional amendment.
   There's no such option now that the Supreme Court has overturned
that law.
   Opponents of a constitutional amendment are proposing a
resolution condemning flag burning and declaring support for the
Bill of Rights. While it is has no binding effect, it would offer a
way to vote for the flag but not the amendment.
   But that's not much political shelter. On the real vote, it's
yes or no. And members of Congress who plan to vote no already can
envision the campaign commercials that will accuse them of catering
to flag-burning radicals.

<HEAD>`Generations' Finding a Tough Road In Daytime Soaps</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Generations,'' the groundbreaking NBC daytime
drama that made blacks an integral part of its stories, faces a
soap opera situation of its own: It might have only six months to
live.
   Since ``Generations'' began in March 1989 with much hoopla and
critical acclaim, it has progressed to the bottom of the daytime
ratings.
   TV's newest soap ranks 12th among the 12 daytime dramas, despite
daring to undertake plot lines with more than a whiff of whimsy.
   In one of the latest plot lines, wicked old Aunt Mary diguised
herself as a nun and smuggled a moosehead stuffed with $60 million
in diamonds out of Chicago by airplane. She was determined to foil
her pursuers by parachuting into Iowa with the moosehead.
   ``It's kinky. It's a campy change of pace,'' said Sally Sussman,
the show's creator, executive producer and head writer. ``We just
finished a very heavy, emotional series. Now we want to pay her
off.''
   Will Aunt Mary survive?
   Will the moosehead?
   Will ``Generations?''
   At the NBC affiliates' meeting earlier this month, network
President Pier Mapes said the show had six months to get out of the
cellar. ``The show is not making money at this point,'' NBC
spokesman Gene Walsh acknowledged.
   ``Generations'' senior executive Jorn H. Winther is very much
aware his show is under the gun. ``We're certainly not downhearted
about it,'' he said. ``It motivates you.''
   ``Generations'' is about two Chicago families _ one white and
affluent, one black and affluent _ whose lives have been
intertwined for three generations. ``We don't just play things from
a black point of view,'' Winther said. ``We try to cross over black
and white story lines. It's realistic.''
   The show has lost one of its two black writers, but is
interviewing others. ``We also want to get black directors involved
with the show,'' Winther said.
   The 18-member cast includes some of the most distinguished black
performers on television, including Richard Roundtree, remembered
for his title role as ``Shaft,'' Taurean Blaque, who played
detective Neal Washington on ``Hill Street Blues,'' and Debbi
Morgan, the first black actress to win a daytime Emmy Award, for
her work on ``All My Children.''
   ``I think our production is very good,'' Winther said. ``We get
great critical reviews. It's very difficult not to see a good
writeup of us.''
   So why is the show in trouble?
   For the week of June 4-10, ``Generations'' had a 2.5 rating and
a 9 share, meaning it was seen in 2.3 million households by 9
percent of the available audience. By contrast, CBS' top-rated
``The Young and the Restless'' had 7.5 million viewers and 31
percent of the time period's audience.
   The sad truth is that NBC, No. 1 in prime time ratings, is No. 3
in daytime television. Much of the trouble for ``Generations,''
Winther and Walsh contend, derives from its well-established
competition.
   ``When the show went on in a lot of areas, it went on against
the second half-hour of `The Young and the Restless,' '' or
5th-ranked ``The Bold and the Beautiful,'' Winther said.
   ``We've got critical support, but we're up against the No. 1
show,'' Walsh said. ``It's like going up against `The Cosby Show'
with another comedy.''
   And, in many places, the show follows or leads into local news _
a kind of dead-end street for the viewers ``Generations'' wants to
attract. ``In most markets, we pull up the news ratings,'' Winther
said.
   Soaps' audience growth is ``glacial,'' Walsh said. ``The daytime
audiences are amazingly loyal. What you're asking people to do is
break with prior loyalties and establish new ones.''
   ``It takes time to do it,'' Winther said. ``It's not like a game
show that can establish itself in 13 weeks.''
   Finding an audience isn't a question of race. Slightly more than
20 percent of the people who watch ``Generations'' are black.
However, the percentage is the roughly equal among the larger
audiences of higher-rated shows.
   ``We have until December to pull up our socks, so to speak,''
Winther said. ``I really believe that's a blessing, that the show
will do that.''

   Elsewhere in television ...
   HOUSE PARTY GOING DARK: ``House Party with Steve Doocy,'' the
one-hour entertainment and information daytime show that began Jan.
22, will air its final installment on Sept. 14. ``The
comedy-information mix did not deal with the sensibilities of the
daytime audience,'' NBC said.
   The show, a collaboration of NBC and Group W, will alternate
repeats with original shows until the final installment, which will
be taped June 29.
   The network and Group W will continue their business
relationship, with two joint ventures in development, including a
``magazine information show'' slated for early evening.

<DATELINE>BARTLESVILLE, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strains of Mozart from the Solisti
New York Chamber Orchestra whistled across the rolling Osage Hills,
beneath a lodge where oilman Frank Phillips and humorist Will
Rogers once spit tobacco juice on the front porch.
   The outdoor concert at Woolaroc wildlife preserve attracted a
sellout crowd, as it does every year. More than 3,000 people
arrived two hours early to claim the best slate-rock seats or to
set up lawn chairs and blankets for a meal of buffalo burgers and
beer.
   ``We like to clash, as long as everything is authentic and done
in the best quality,'' says Nan Buhlinger, executive director of
the OK Mozart International Festival.
   Quality is not questioned during the nine-day festival, which
has grown so fast ``people are killing for tickets,'' says Ransom
Wilson, a renowned flutist and artist director of the festival.
   The Solisti New York is complemented by Robin Sutherland,
pianist for the San Francisco Symphony, French-born conductor
Catherine Comet, the Boston Chamber Music Society and several other
nationally acclaimed artists from around the nation.
   All of them set aside two weeks in June to come to this northern
Oklahoma town known more as the headquarters for Phillips Petroleum
Co. than for aficionados of fine arts.
   ``All you have to do is come once,'' said Sutherland, who has
been to every festival since it began in 1985. ``I feel sorry for
those who can't come here or won't come here. The high point of my
year is to come here and collaborate with these people.''
   The festival could be considered unique because of the outdoor
concert at Woolaroc, where artists don black and pink T-shirts and
concert-goers smell more of bug spray than perfumes.
   But the concert hall in the Bartlesville Community Center holds
the key to the festival. It was there, in 1982, that Wilson
directed a symphony and fell in love with the acoustics.
   Sutherland, who has known Wilson since they attended the
Juilliard School in New York City, said Wilson asked him to come
for the first OK Mozart festival.
   ``The first year was hard,'' Sutherland said. ``I knew nothing
about this place. Ransom said it was the coolest hall we know of.''
   So how does a city of 35,000 come up with a concert hall that
artists from Boston, New York and San Francisco rave about?
   ``It's a matter of luck,'' Sutherland says. ``There are
accoustians who claim that different scientific factors determine
the quality. But if it comes down to science, why are there so many
rotten walls?''
   Buhlinger said this year's festival drew about 30,000 from 31
states. Because Bartlesville doesn't have the activity of a
metropolitan city, she developed the Festival Showcase, a gamut of
displays and events that blend Mozart with the heritage of Oklahoma.
   The Showcase involves local residents, something Wilson said was
instrumental in the rapid growth and national recognition the
festival has achieved.
   ``What makes this unique is there are two festivals at the same
time,'' Wilson said. ``It's not just the concerts, it's the
showcase events every day. You get a real Oklahoma flavor and the
everyone's participation is the key to the success.''
   If nothing else, Buhlinger said the Mozart festival goes a long
way in dispelling myths of Oklahoma built on the days of Cowboys
and Indians and the dust bowl.
   ``I think most people are absolutely surprised,'' she said.
``Everybody doesn't walk around here with straws in their teeth. I
think some people come here and expect to see wild horses running
through the streets.''
   Sutherland said all he needed was dinner in one resident's home
to remind him that Bartlesville has plenty of culture.
   ``These people may speak with a drawl, but they've got antiques
in their homes from Japan, Belgium,'' he said. ``Phillips is a
worldwide company. It's not like they've never left their homes.''
   The charm of the small-town mixed with an international
corporation leads Wilson to claim that ``all the smart people are
here.''
   ``There's not another town like it that I have come across in
the United States,'' Wilson said. ``It's got a population of
35,000, yet it has its own cultural institution. They are educated
people from all over the world and they demand culture.''
   And, says string bassist Carolyn Davis of the Solisti New York,
they cling to it.
   ``It's unique to have a town where everyone jumps on the
bandwagon and is so enthusiastic,'' said Davis. ``You don't need
that much knowledge to understand the music and enjoy it.
   ``I prefer playing for audiences with enthusiasm. Some sit on
their hands and you don't get feedback, so it's not as special.
There's a certain camaraderie here.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ At a time of growing uneasiness over Japan's
encroachment into the U.S. economy, the Japanese expatriate
community is stressing volunteerism as the key to winning friends
in America. Individuals and corporations alike are getting involved
in local community service projects. That's all the more remarkable
because back home the concept of corporate social concern is rare.

   In America, the gentleman from Japan pursuing ``sogo shoku,''
the career path to the executive suite, is confronted with two
conflicting challenges in the course of a long, long day.
   How to be a good corporate citizen in a host country where the
polls and his own foreign minister assert that people feel more
threatened by Japan's economic power than by the military might of
the Soviet Union?
   And how to maintain Japanese culture within his own family
circle constantly encircled by American lifestyles and values and
the incomprehensible ``kids English'' that his children speak.
   It is a puzzlement, which could lead to ``ensei,'' weariness of
life, because the day indeed is long.
   In the New York metropolitan area, where the Japanese community
is estimated at 60,000 and the 7:36 commuter train out of Hartsdale
is known as the ``Orient Express,'' a typical Japanese executive
will be at his desk by 8:30 a.m. He stays at least until 7:30 p.m.,
which is the best time for phone calls from the shoguns at Tokyo
headquarters.
   At noon, in keeping with the new good-neighbor policy, he may
address a Rotary Club, attend a United Way meeting or teach a
business course at a community college. He may even join the
serving line at an inner-city soup kitchen.
   When he arrives at his home in the suburbs late in the evening,
he may find his wife stuffing envelopes for the American Heart
Association or teaching origami, the ancient art of folding paper
into fanciful animals, to a group of neighbors.
   Before hitting the futon, his sleeping mat, he tries to coax the
kids away from TV long enough to discuss Japanese culture and maybe
help them compose a haiku or two, those exquisite ``snowflakes of
poems,'' written in three lines of 17 syllables.
   On weekends he may umpire a Little League game _ a ``most
humbling experience good for the soul,'' as a Nippon Steel
executive admitted _ or join his son on a camping trip, play in a
company softball game or go on a chartered bus to the Concord, a
Jewish resort in the Catskills, for a round of golf which is so
expensive in Japan.
   He worries about ``koroshi,'' death from overwork, sometimes
diagnosed as ``hari-kari at the water cooler.''
   But these days, he worries most about being ``a good corporate
citizen in America.''
   At a time when Japan's $50 billion annual trade imbalance is
increasing friction with the United States, and a Fortune Magazine
cover story warns that ``for too many Americans the Japanese have
become the people it's OK to hate,'' the growing Japanese
expatriate community is anxiously stressing ``volunteerism'' as the
key to understanding and friendship.
   ``Volunteerism is a significant element of life in the United
States that we in the Japanese community, both as individuals and
corporations, must come to terms with,'' urged Hisao Kondo,
president of Mitsui U.S.A., in his preface to ``Joining In,'' a
how-to book on community involvement issued by the Japanese Chamber
of Commerce and Industry in New York.
   British investors actually control more of America, but the
Japanese seem to be everywhere and into everything _ from 7-Eleven
stores and Mama Leone's restaurant to Rockefeller Center, Columbia
Pictures and CBS Records.
   It was the smiling, elaborately courteous gentlemen from Japan
who plunked down $82 million for van Gogh's ``Portrait of Dr.
Gachet,'' then two days later $78 million for Renoir's ``At the
Moulin de la Galette.''
   They control eight of the world's 10 largest banks, own much of
Waikiki Beach, Anne Klein fashions, Tiffany's, the Arco Plaza and
Riviera country club in Los Angeles and such landmark New York
hotels as the Algonquin, the Stanhope and the Essex House. They are
backing several Broadway shows and peddling America's best-selling
car, the Honda Accord.
   They are buying up Colorado ranches to market an overseas
version of hand-massaged Kobe beef and even television's latest
prime-time blockbuster, ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' is a
spinoff from a Tokyo's ``Fun With Ken and Kaito Chan.''
   They are seen handing out checks on TV to winners of PGA golf
tournaments with names like the Honda Classic, the Nissan Los
Angeles Open and the Isuzu Kapalua International.

   Golf, the old Scottish game invented by the Dutch and embraced
so enthusiastically in the Americas, now holds the Japanese in
thrall.
   The overseas Japanese in particular crave it like chopped sushi.
   Hardly a week goes by without news of Japanese investors
negotiating to buy up another American golf course: La Costa at
Carlsbad, Calif., Valencia, Malibu and the Riviera Club, all in the
Los Angeles area, the Country Club of Louisiana in Baton Rouge and
a number of golf resorts from Hawaii to Florida.
   Dai-ichi has acquired the Lakeover course in upper Westchester
County, N.Y. Mitsui recently purchased 240 acres of Lincoln Hall,
an institution for troubled juveniles, to build an 18-hole course
in New York's Putnam County.
   The corporate membership board in the lobby of the Canyon Club
at Armonk, N.Y., reads like a Tokyo business directory: Bank of
Tokyo, Fujitsu, Honda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Sony, Tokio Marine &amp;
Fire Insurance.
   The 220 members of the venerable Tamarack Club in Greenwich,
Conn., recently made headlines in the opposite direction by voting
down a $50 million offer from Japanese buyers. The sale would have
brought each member nearly a quarter-million dollars before taxes
and playing rights for another year.
   The Japanese passion for the game is more than just the pursuit
of happiness. The golf cart closely follows the career track.
   ``In Japan,'' explains Konosuke Shimizo, manager of Sony
America, ``golf is the sport of high society, a cultural symbol for
successful people.''
   But the ancient game ``is terribly expensive in Japan,'' says
Teruhiko Maruyama, senior vice president of Tokio Marine &amp; Fire
Insurance. ``Membership in a prestigious Tokyo club could cost
upward of a million dollars. Green fees on a weekend might be
something like $250.
   ``Newly developed courses in the countryside are cheaper, but
you would have to travel four hours to get there. At home, it is
possible to play once a month or less, while here golf is very
convenient.''
   In Japan, adds Karie Goto, a Connecticut realtor with a steady
Japanese clientele, ``you must make reservations even at a driving
range.''
   Those five-tiered, floodlit, 24-hour driving ranges often
pictured in golf magazines point up both the Japanese ardor for the
game and the high cost of land there.
   In a nation where a highway right-of-way recently cost the
government $1 million a yard, a golf course would call for
financing worthy of a skyscraper. Commercial property goes for an
average $210,000 a square yard.
   Small wonder that on many Japanese courses the caddies, mostly
girls, carry baskets of grass seed to repair divots and scuff marks
in the world's most expensive turf.
   Or that Japanese players bow reverently on the first tee and
have a reputation for slow play, as if treasuring each moment on
the fairways and greens.
   Those afflicted with ``golf-kichigai,'' golfing madness, find it
more economical to take charter flights to Scotland or Hawaii
several times a year for a ``total immersion, 36-holes-a-day
vacation'' than belong to a local club.
   A Japanese conglomerate has bought land in the Soviet Union for
a links course along the Sea of Japan at Nakhodka, just over an
hour's flight from Tokyo.
   Besides their love of the game, Japanese investors have in the
last decade switched from low-return real estate investments to
high risk, but high return resort development. They realize that
the U.S. population, like their own, is graying statistically and
increased leisure time means increased business opportunities.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ They're the people who have lost jobs and homes,
gone hungry and suffered illness, endured beatings or lived with
disabilities. They've been scarred by foster care, harassed at the
office or traumatized by illegal abortions. They're the people who
testify before congressional hearings, the people who put a human
face on cold statistics.

   Peggy Adams is an expert in raising children
and pulling together ends that don't quite meet. Hunger is no
stranger in her household.
   ``I have seen my children's bodies stop growing like they
should, and I pray it's not their brains as well,'' Mrs. Adams said
earlier this year at a Senate Budget Committee hearing on federal
food and nutrition programs.
   It was an emotional moment.
   ``These senators were glued to their chairs and listening to
every word intently,'' Jeff Coleman, a senior income analyst for
the committee, said later. ``You could see on the spot that people
were being affected. The questions they asked were very, very
thoughtful.''
   Capitol Hill hearings are often characterized by the relentless
recitation of government statistics, the polite drone of think tank
researchers, the familiar arguments of professional lobbyists.
   Even the most sensitive lawmakers can become numbed. That's when
it's time to bring on the victims.
   They're the people who have lost jobs and homes, gone hungry and
suffered illness, endured beatings and lived with disabilities.
They've been scarred by foster care, harassed at the office and
traumatized by illegal abortions.
   ``They're very useful because they're real. They take all the
studies and statistics and make them personal,'' says Rep. George
Miller, D-Calif., whose Select Committee on Children, Youth and
Families showcases victims of everything from domestic violence to
gang warfare.
   Though some may relive their agonies and humiliations to no
avail, the consensus is that any cause is strengthened by the
testimony of an ordinary person with no ax to grind.
   Advocacy and research groups ``certainly have a place and a
role,'' says Judith Lichtman, president of the Women's Legal
Defense Fund. ``But very often real-world hardships are more
persuasive.''
   Lichtman's group is working for a bill that would guarantee
unpaid, job-protected leave for employees needed at home.
   The House recently passed the job-leave bill after three years
of hearings and a parade of people forced out of their jobs by
births, adoptions or medical emergencies.
   One man testified was assigned to a night shift at a doughnut
bakery although he had told his boss he had to drive his infant
daughter to a Washington hospital that night. She was scheduled for
heart surgery the next day. ``I am no hero,'' said David Wilt of
York, Pa. ``I am just a working man who was fired because he loved
his kids.''
   A woman from Charleston, S.C., claimed she was assured she could
return to her job at a retail store after a doctor-ordered medical
leave during a difficult pregnancy. But when she returned six weeks
after having the baby, she said she was told no jobs were
available. ``It hurt,'' said Liberia Johnson. ``My family needed
the income.''
   Dexter Manley, linebacker for the Washington Redskins, was asked
last year to discuss his learning disability at a hearing. When he
realized he could not read his prepared statement, he broke down
and cried before a battery of television cameras.
   At hearings on a bill expanding federal child care programs, a
bereaved couple haltingly recalled the death of their child in
unlicensed day care and a police officer told of finding two
children, left alone by a mother desperate to hold onto her job,
dead inside a dryer.
   Senators heard unusually graphic testimony this year at a
hearing on an abortion-rights bill. One member of the audience
fainted as witnesses described their illegal abortions and
self-induced miscarriages.
   Aides who orchestrate these hearings say politicians find it
difficult to be argumentative or ideological when a victim is
sitting in front of them.
   If a woman says she thwarted the law and risked her health to
get an illegal abortion, ``that decision-making process is
something that's hard to second-guess,'' said Kelly Signs, an aide
to Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio.

   Diane Shust, a Miller aide, said one House member tried to take
on a witness at a hearing on the ``sandwich generation'' _ people
who have to raise kids and care for ailing parents at the same time
_ and got nowhere.
   ``She just fired back at him. She slashed his theories to
shreds,'' Shust recalled. ``There was no way he could counter.
There was the expert sitting in front of him.''
   The perfect victim _ someone who is genuine, articulate and
sympathetic _ often surfaces in a newspaper story, a letter to a
lawmaker or a list kept by an advocacy group.
   Signs, who organized the Senate abortion-rights hearing, said
all the witnesses who told personal stories had already done so at
least once before in a public forum. She said it is hard to find
women willing to talk about long-ago abortions.
   ``They were not legal and were done under secretive conditions.
There may be members of their family who don't know about it,''
Signs said.
   Most advocacy groups can readily point congressional aides
toward people who have experienced the problem they want to
illuminate. And some go even further. The Maryland Food Committee
of Baltimore has developed a ``talent pool'' of sorts _ a stable of
eloquent poor people regularly dispatched to press conferences,
meetings and hearings.
   Coleman said the Baltimore group came up with six or seven
possible witnesses for the Senate hunger hearing in February. The
two chosen were Adams, a white woman with nine children, and Mary
Tamper, a black woman with two children.
   Adams said her family lost its income when she separated from
her husband, who made $55,000 a year as an engineer. He was jailed
on child abuse charges. Tamper's husband, whose annual salary was
$30,000, died of leukemia. She said she had to give up her
teacher's aide job and move the family in with her mother.
   Coleman said the two women, forced to rely on a variety of
federal programs to feed their kids, were picked with an eye toward
breaking stereotypes.
   ``Both had been middle class,'' he said. ``We felt that was a
strong message. There are so many myths about who poor people are _
minorities with lots and lots of kids, on welfare and food stamps
for years. We felt it was important not to perpetuate those myths.''
   From Coleman's viewpoint, the hearing was a success. He said its
major recommendations _ to expand food stamps and a nutrition
program for mothers and children _ won the support of both chairman
Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., and Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., the senior GOP
member of the panel. The extra money may be added to the 1990 farm
bill.
   Lichtman said victim witnesses also helped secure passage of a
1988 fair housing law.
   When women described being denied housing because they had kids,
``that helped make the case about why we needed to prohibit
discrimination against families with children,'' said Lichtman.
   She said the same dynamics were at work when the Voting Rights
Act was extended in 1982. ``People were brought in from Alabama and
Georgia and talked about what it was like to be disenfranchised or
never enfranchised,'' Lichtman said. ``That helped get the law
reauthorized.''
   Lawmakers sympathized with witnesses who said they'd been fired
for taking a couple of weeks off while their children were
hospitalized or dying, and that may be part of the reason the House
recently passed a job-leave bill. But the bill is facing tough
opposition in the Senate and at the White House.
   Parents who testified about the shortcomings of day care also
made an impression, but a compromise child-care bill now in the
works probably won't resolve all of the problems they raised
regarding quality, price and availability.
   And foster children continue to suffer neglect and abuse despite
a little boy's poignant testimony in 1987.
   Marcia Lowry, the ACLU attorney who accompanied the boy to that
hearing, said at the time that agencies were not meeting federal
requirements to monitor foster kids, find permanent homes for them
or provide services to preserve their families. She also alleged an
almost complete lack of federal supervision.
   What has happened since then?
   ``Things have gotten worse,'' said Lowry, director of the ACLU's
Children's Rights Project.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ With the approach of the Fourth of July holiday,
a reporter set out to explore a family legend, kinship with a
signer of the Declaration of Independence. He found his ancestral
roots were tangled. But in the untangling he learned a lot about
two different families in colonial America at the time of the
Revolutionary War.

   YORKTOWN, Va. _ The search for Peggy Nelson led to this charming
colonial town on the bluffs of the York River, to the redoubts and
trenches where the Continental Army won America's independence.
   It was a genealogical wrong turn, the kind I had been warned
about, a textbook example of the pitfalls encountered in pursuing
one's pedigree. You can't always accept what your elders tell you
as fact.
   Peggy Nelson, you see, was my great-great-great-grandmother, the
wife of one Matthew Langford, an adventuresome South Carolinian who
was forever pushing on to new frontiers.
   In the early years of the 19th century, according to family
tradition, Matt and Peggy followed old Indian trails across the
South, traveling by ox cart and on foot, young kids in tow. Their
moves every few years took them from the backwoods of western South
Carolina to southern Illinois to Tennessee to Alabama to
Mississippi and finally to Arkansas.
   So what was I doing in this beautifully restored Virginia
village, a shrine to colonial America, the site of the decisive
battle of the Revolutionary War?
   Family tradition, passed on in letters to my father, held that
Peggy Nelson was a niece of Gen. Thomas Nelson Jr. of Yorktown, a
signer of the Declaration of Independence, the governor of Virginia
during the Revolution and commander of the Virginia militia during
the Siege of Yorktown in 1781.
   Born into a wealthy family of planters and merchants, Thomas
Nelson Jr., was educated in England. He was named for his
grandfather, ``Scotch Tom'' Nelson, an immigrant from England who
became one of Yorktown's most prominent citizens. His father,
William Nelson, served for years as president of the King's Council.
   A rotund man who suffered asthma, Thomas Nelson was a delegate
to the Continental Congress in 1775 and was among the first of the
patriots to sound the call for independence.
   During the Revolutionary War he helped bankroll the Virginia
militia by borrowing heavily on his own considerable assets. As a
consequence, Thomas Nelson Jr. died a pauper in Hanover County,
Va., in 1789. He was buried without a tombstone at the foot of his
father's grave at Grace Episcopal Church in Yorktown. Not until
this century was a stone marker provided.
   Quite a guy, Thomas Nelson was. And quite a handsome ornament in
one's family tree, if it could be proven.
   A few months ago I started to get serious about tracing family
roots. I started spending a lot of time in libraries, thumbing
through indexes of censuses, deeds, wills, military records, family
histories. I joined the National Genealogical Society.
   ``It can become addictive,'' a colleague had warned.
   I bought a home computer and computer software from the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which has perhaps the world's
largest store of genealogical information. While family history is
an important part of the Mormon religion, they welcome an exchange
of information from non-members as well.
   In ``Instructions for Beginners in Genealogy,'' the NGS had
warned, ``Invariably you will come across the belief that the
founders of a particular family were three brothers who came here
at an early date.''
   Strike those ``three brothers from England'' in my father's
notes.
   The NGS booklet also warned against ``association with a famous
person or event.''
   ``Stories like this may have some foundation,'' the booklet
said, ``but often they are impossible to verify.''
   I pushed on looking for the Yorktown link anyway.
   My father's notes identified Peggy Nelson's parents as Dr.
Robert Nelson and his wife, Rebecca, presumably from Virginia.
   In the library of the New York Genealogical Society in
Manhattan, I found a yellowed and fragile copy of the ``Genealogy
of the Page Family in Virginia,'' published in 1893. (The Pages and
the Nelsons committed considerable matrimony together in those
days.)
   According to the Page document, Thomas Nelson did indeed have a
brother named Robert. But neither of Robert Nelson's two wives was
named Rebecca, none of his children was named Peggy, and there was
no ``Dr.'' before his name.
   So who was Peggy's daddy?
   I came on to Yorktown, hoping perhaps to find some old records
at Grace Episcopal Church to prove the Page genealogy inaccurate or
incomplete. Besides, the NGS instructions had warned against
believing everything you read.
   I toured the beautiful old homes of Yorktown, including that of
Thomas C. Nelson Jr., which is supposed to have a couple of cannon
balls lodged in its walls, but I couldn't find any.

   It's part of the family tradition, upheld by some historians,
that Nelson ordered artillery fire on his own estate because the
British commander, Lord Charles Cornwallis, was holed up there.
Cornwallis, it is said, then took refuge in a cave down on the
river bank below the town. The cave is still there, the entrance
guarded by iron bars.
   I toured the battlefield where Gen. George Washington and the
Continental Army, with no little help from the Marquis de Lafayette
and the French fleet, on Oct. 19, 1781 forced the trapped British
and Hessian armies to surrender, 8,300 troops in all. It was the
last major battle of the Revolutionary War.
   I saw the Surrender Field and the restored Moore House where the
terms of the surrender were negotiated.
   But I found no records linking my family with all of this rich
history.
   Since there are no libraries in Yorktown, my next stop was the
library of the National Genealogical Society in Arlington, Va.
   When I suggested that my lost ancestor must have been of age to
serve in the Revolutionary War, the head librarian, Susan Canby,
suggested looking through some rosters.
   Sure enough, in John H. Gwathney's ``Historical Register of
Virginians in the Revolution, 1775-1783,'' there were TWO Robert
Nelsons.
   The first was described as an adjutant in Gen. Nelson's Corps,
Light Dragoons. The other was identified as a corporal in the 9th
Virginia Regiment, Continental Line.
   Then, from back in the stacks, Ms. Canby called out, ``Did he
have a wife named Rebecca?''
   Bingo!
   ``The D.A.R.'s got him,'' she said, looking up from the ``D.A.R.
Patriot Index.'' That meant that one or more women had shown
ancestral links with this same Robert Nelson to qualify for
membership in the Daughters of the American Revolution.
   At the D.A.R.'s imposing library near the White House in
Washington I was allowed (for a $5 fee) to look at microfilm of
three of those applications.
   Another bingo!
   Not only did this Robert have a wife named Rebecca, but he had a
``Dr.'' before his name. He served in the 9th Virginia Regiment,
commanded by Col. George Matthews, from January 1777 to February
1778, attaining the rank of corporal. (But why just corporal, if he
was a doctor?)
   And there was a third clue. While this Robert Nelson lived in
Stafford County, Va., during the war, he later moved to Greenville
County, S.C.
   Enter Matthew Langford.
   Matthew Langford, born in 1775, was the eldest son of Eli
Langford Sr. and his wife, Sarah. Eli Langford, shown in the 1790
federal census as having three sons, three daughters and one slave,
obtained four land grants in western South Carolina between 1786
and 1802, mainly in the 96 and Pendleton Districts. He also bought
several hundred acres on the Broad River in nearby Franklin County,
Ga.
   By 1802, Matthew Langford, now married to Peggy Nelson, was
living in Greenville County, S.C. One transaction recorded that
year shows him buying 50 acres on South Tyger Creek in Marietta,
S.C., from one Robert Nelson Sr.
   Five years later, shortly after the birth of their fifth child,
Matthew and Peggy put their show on the road, first to southern
Illinois where Matthew's brother, Eli Jr., had a boat landing and
ferry on the Mississippi River.
   Then for several years they moved through Tennessee, to Overton
County and Lincoln County. In 1822 they showed up in Marion County,
Ala., where they apparently lived until moving to Choctaw County,
Miss., in 1836. They appear in the 1850 census as residents of
Holmes County, Miss.
   Family tradition holds that they wound up in White County, Ark.,
where they died.
   As church-going Methodists they gave their seven children
biblical names _ Eli, Rebecca, Elijah, Anne, Elisha and John. They
named my great-great-grandfather Lorenzo Dow for the famous
circuit-riding preacher, the one who invented camp meetings.
   Lorenzo Dow Langford would become a circuit rider himself,
appointed a preacher-at-large by the Methodist Conference in
Natchez, Miss., in 1837. He was a preacher for 60 years, working
territory along the Natchez Trace and eventually holding pastorates
in French Camp, Louisville, Coffeeville and Fletcher's Chapel,
Miss., and Greensboro, Ala.
   Three of Lorenzo Dow Langford's sons _ Peggy Nelson's grandsons
_ would fight on the Confederate side in the Civil War.
   For them, there would be no glorious victories. For them, the
Fourth of July would not be celebrated. It would be remembered as
the day Vicksburg fell to the Yankees.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The growing violence among warring black
factions in South Africa has many leaders worried that the country
could lapse into all-out civil war once white rule is ended.
Thousands of blacks die at the hands of other blacks each year as
anarchy spreads though the black townships. Some fear South Africa
could become another Lebanon.

   The daily police reports list
the atrocities: nine black men knifed by a mob, three black women
burned to death, a 9-year-old girl ``necklaced'' with a burning
tire.
   Nearly always, the victims and their killers are black.
   Despite 350 years of black-white racial divisions, one of the
ironies of life in South Africa is that thousands of blacks die
each year fighting other blacks, instead of apartheid.
   At a time when President F.W. de Klerk is moving to end
white-minority rule, black-against-black violence is spinning out
of control, some analysts say. A culture of violence is becoming
part of South African life, they say, threatening hopes of building
a peaceful, democratic society.
   The independent South African Institute of Race Relations
estimates 4,000 people will die in black-against-black violence
this year. About 1,400 blacks died in factional fighting in 1989,
according to the institute.
   Victims are often hacked to death with knives or spears, the
mutilated bodies burned. Dozens have been killed by ``necklacing,''
with gasoline-soaked tires placed around their necks and set afire.
   Some leaders see the threat of a civil war, with South Africa
becoming another Lebanon.
   ``The appalling numbers of people who are dying, it is
absolutely shocking,'' anti-apartheid leader Rev. Allan Boesak said
in an interview with The Associated Press. ``That is the kind of
situation that can lead to the Lebanization of South Africa.''
   Some black leaders worry that the growing rivalry among warring
black factions is the prelude to a struggle for power once white
rule ends. Itumeleng Mosala, president of the Azanian People's
Organization, foresees increasing violence between blacks if
apartheid ends.
   ``It's going to continue because violence has a way of repeating
itself,'' he says. ``So, I would say that we are going to see a
situation of near civil war in this country.''
   White supporters of apartheid cite black violence when defending
white-minority rule. They claim black-majority rule would signal a
massive bloodbath.
   White settlers in Kenya and Rhodesia, before it became Zimbabwe,
used the same argument in opposing the approach of black rule in
those countries. But while rival black groups struggled briefly for
power after independence, there was little killing and whites were
not singled out for revenge.
   Kenya and Zimbabwe, however, did not experience the massive
black-on-black violence now sweeping South Africa.
   The causes of black violence in South Africa are many and
complex. Reasons include apartheid, poverty, anti-government
struggle, school boycotts, political and ideological rivalry, the
collapse of authority, gangs and corruption.
   The bloodshed is compounded by old tribal and clan rivalries
stretching back over generations.
   In the squalid black townships, violence has become a daily part
of life for the millions of blacks forced to compete desperately
for survival, say Boesak and others. Caught by hopeless poverty and
apartheid laws, violence is one of the few ways for blacks to vent
their anger, they say.
   ``One would have to say that the basic problem here is
apartheid, that it has created circumstances in which violence
became not only the norm, but the almost natural action and
reaction,'' Boesak says.
   In the early 1980s, the African National Congress, the main
black opposition group, called for a program of destabilization to
make the country ``ungovernable'' and undermine the white
government. Young blacks became the spearhead, demonstrating,
attacking police and boycotting schools.
   Local administration and control was undermined in many black
townships. Blacks seen as government ``collaborators,'' including
black township councilors and black police, were frequently
attacked and killed.
   But often the anti-government ``struggle'' is little more than
mob violence by youth gangs, says Mohammed Valli Moosa, an
anti-apartheid leader. In some black townships there is now
virtually no authority and rival groups try to wrest control.
   Some black leaders concede these tactics helped create a ``lost
generation,'' young blacks raised in poverty with virtually no
education and a burning hatred for authority _ black and white.
   ``Many of these youths missed out on education and are
unemployed and unemployable,'' says political analyst David Breier.
``They are the generation of `no education before liberation.'''
   But the lawlessness has spread to almost every level, involving
businesses, workers and schoolchildren. A recent ``war'' between
rival taxi companies in a Johannesburg township left more than 20
dead.
   Criminal gangs have exploited the unrest, sparking wars with
radical young blacks. Groups of vigilantes, some linked to police,
have warred with rival ``comrades'' from the ANC and other
political groups.
   Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader recently released from prison,
and others have attempted to halt the violence by appealing to
youths to return to school. But the appeals have been spurned by
many who reject negotiation with the government.
   ``The problem is that many of the youngsters are not really
interested in negotiation. In fact, they have become a little bit
angry,'' said senior ANC leader Walter Sisulu.
   The violence has been exacerbated by increasingly bitter
disputes between rival black political groups. While all are
opposed to apartheid, various factions are competing for support
with conflicting visions for South Africa's future.
   In Natal Province, some 5,000 blacks have been killed in recent
years in vicious fighting between the conservative Inkatha
political movement and allies of the ANC. The struggle pits a
traditional group with strong tribal roots against urban forces
seeking a modern, ethnically integrated society, analysts say.
   The ANC favors confrontational methods such as its guerrilla
campaign, sanctions and boycotts, and rejects black homeland
governments as part of the apartheid system. Inkatha supports the
homeland system, saying blacks must run their own affairs as an
interim step on the road to black majority rule.
   The struggle has tribal overtones, with Inkatha relying on
traditional Zulu followers while the ANC-allied United Democratic
Front combines urbanized Zulus and other tribes, analysts say.
   The ANC, regarded as the largest and most powerful black group,
also faces strong opposition from more militant organizations such
as the Pan African Congress and groups linked to the Black
Consciousness Movement.
   The PAC broke away from the ANC because of its multiracial
foundation. The PAC is an ``Africanist'' group that campaigns for
Africans to control all aspects of life and rejects Western
influences.
   ``Political tolerance is, sadly, not a strong feature of our
country,'' says Alf Stadler, a political science professor at the
University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa's gold-mining and
industrial region.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ On Aug. 4, the Grenadier Guards will march past
the London home of Her Majesty the Queen Mum playing ``Happy
Birthday,'' culminating four months of festivities in honor of
Britain's favorite granny. Queen Mother Elizabeth is turning 90,
but she shows no signs of slackening her crowded schedule of public
appearances.

   She likes fast cars, cricket and betting on
horses. She always wears pearls, even when salmon fishing in
Scotland, and her saintly smile is so popular that she uses a
see-through umbrella.
   She's Queen Mother Elizabeth, diminutive matriarch of the royal
family, favorite granny of the nation, turning 90 this year with a
four-month birthday party.
   Festivities kicked off April 25 with a reception at Cardiff
Castle where Viscount Tonypandy, former speaker of the House of
Commons, predicted ``a tremendous wave of public affection around
the whole country.''
   Well-wishers waited five deep on the streets outside the castle,
including 91-year-old Tryphena Price who walked a mile to see the
queen mother.
   ``She certainly does not look 90,'' enthused Mrs. Price, ``and I
should know.''
   They were rewarded by a sight as familiar as Big Ben or the
White Cliffs of Dover _ Her Majesty the Queen Mum in trademark hat,
three strings of pearls and frothy, pastel dress.
   As she bestowed graceful waves and smiles on her loyal fans, it
was hard to imagine that the mother of Queen Elizabeth II is as old
as the century. But she shows no signs of slackening her crowded
schedule of public appearances.
   This year is especially busy with receptions, dinners and garden
parties, and a gala performance in her honor featuring opera stars
Dame Kiri Te Kanawa and Placido Domingo, the Royal Ballet, Sir John
Gielgud, Dame Peggy Ashcroft and Dame Vera Lynn.
   The 27 military units and the 300 organizations over which she
presides will mass on London's Horse Guards Parade for a
spectacular ceremonial tribute. Commemorative coins and stamps will
feature the royal nonagenarian, along with the inevitable slew of
unauthorized queen mother mugs and tea towels for the tourists.
   On Aug. 1, she will pay a poignant visit to London's East End
where she and her late husband, King George VI, brought comfort
during the dark days of the blitz. During the war the East End was
a working class neighborhood that included the London Docks on the
Thames River, vital to shipping at the time.
   The party culminates on her birthday three days later with the
Grenadier Guards marching past her London home playing ``Happy
Birthday.''
   The queen mother is the oldest member of the royal family ever
to hold the title conferred on a king's widow.
   She was born Lady Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon on Aug.
4, 1900, the ninth child of the Earl and Countess of Strathmore,
whose family home was Glamis Castle, legendary home of
Shakespeare's Macbeth, in northeast Scotland.
   Her family periodically entertained King George V and Queen Mary
and their children. When Elizabeth married their second son,
Albert, in 1923, after twice refusing, she was the first non-royal
bride in centuries to marry so close to the throne.
   No one then dreamed that King Edward VIII would abdicate in 1936
to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson, and that his younger
brother, bashful, stuttering Albert, would become King George VI.
   It was a reign neither Albert nor Elizabeth had sought.
   ``When finally it was known that her husband was to become king,
and she queen, she was in bed with the flu,'' says Tom Corby,
author of a new book about the queen mother. ``She said to a member
of the household, `Well, we've just got to make the best of it,'
and make the best of it she did.''
   She is credited with restoring stability to the royal family,
badly shaken by the abdication, and transforming her shy husband
into a people's king.
   Harold Brooks-Baker of Burke's Peerage, a guide to the
aristocracy, says he doubts the royal family would have permitted
Albert's marriage to a commoner, had it guessed he might become
King George VI.
   Brooks-Baker said in an interview that the queen mother's
enduring popularity is rooted in the way she and her husband rose
to the task of reigning, and made themselves so visible in London
during World War II.
   ``They never flinched,'' he said.
   Elizabeth rejected Winston Churchill's advice to move to Canada,
and after bombs hit Buckingham Palace, the monarchs' London
residence, in September 1940, she said, ``I'm glad we've been
bombed. It makes me feel I can look the East End in the face.''
   George died of lung cancer in 1952, leaving her a widow at age
51, and she went into seclusion until Churchill cajoled her into
returning to public life.
   She still refers to her husband as ``the King'' and declines
public appearances on the anniversaries of his birth, marriage and
death. Most biographers say she believes the strain of being king
hastened his death, and that she never fully forgave Wallis Simpson
for her part in the abdication.
   Today, her image combines angelic virtue with fun-loving
earthiness.
   Alone among a generally abstemious family, the queen mother
enjoys an occasional pint of beer or gin and tonic. She's a deft
hand with card tricks. She's mad about the races and breeds her own
horses.
   A television documentary marking her 85th birthday disclosed
that Clarence House, her London home, is the only private residence
in Britain known to have a ``blower,'' the service providing
betting shops with race results and running commentaries on horse
races.
   Thriller writer Dick Francis, who was her jockey from 1953 to
1956, said in an interview, ``She puts everyone she meets at their
ease straight away and she's so knowledgeable about the things
she's interested in, like racing. ''
   Although the queen mother appears to be in robust health, a 1986
leg injury stubbornly refused to heal and she was hospitalized that
year with a throat spasm suffered during a fish dinner. Four years
earlier, surgeons had to remove a fish bone from her throat.
   Corby attributes her good health and longevity to the fact ``she
can't accept illness and she regards aspirin almost as a dangerous
drug.''
   ``If she gave up and sort of retired, I think that would have a
bad affect on her,'' he said. ``She just keeps going. You see her
walking around on heels which are only slightly less high than ones
she wore when she was a girl.''
   Her routine rarely varies: breakfast and newspapers in bed as a
piper parades outside her window; up at 9 a.m. and on the telephone
to her daughter down the street at Buckingham Palace.
   It's a call relished by palace switchboard operators, who get to
say: ``Your Majesty? I have Her Majesty on the line, Your Majesty.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ For years, Russell Chatham held the professional
art world in contempt, dismissing most dealers as shysters. He
lived modestly in a rented Montana ranch house, painting his
landscapes but refusing to promote his work. But look at Russell
Chatham now. Thirty years worth of his paintings are on display at
the Museum of the Rockies and a Chatham canvas can command a price
in six figures.

   Without even a handshake between them, a
painter and a museum director batted around the idea and came to an
agreement: Together they would stage the biggest one-man show by a
living artist in the history of Montana. The deal was struck, the
deed was done.
   Then the museum director quit and moved away.
   But this is the American West, where a man's word is still
supposed to count. So the painter painted and the idea stayed alive.
   This summer, in the multimillion-dollar new wing of the Museum
of the Rockies on the grounds of Montana State University, 30 years
worth of Russell Chatham's paintings, including 12 major new works
and a companion exhibit, fill more than 9,000 square feet. The huge
show opened June 9 and runs through Oct. 7.
   On every wall in two of the museum's three galleries Chatham's
works are on display. In the third display area there are pictures,
sculpture, and pottery by Chatham's relatives and friends, which
have inspired the 51-year-old painter since he first took up a
brush at the age of 8.
   Chatham, a landscape artist who grew up around San Francisco,
found his artistic vision in the Paradise Valley and environs of
Montana. Headquartered in a frontier-vintage building in
Livingston, he has become well-known and moderately well-fixed.
Collectors wait two or three years for a new acquisition that could
cost up to six figures.
   A modest fellow of down-home bent, Chatham can, however, become
cantankerous when discussing modern art trends. He hates most of
them, and holds nearly all museum curators and art gallery owners
in contempt.
   Therefore, when Mick Hager, the museum's former director who now
heads the Virginia Museum of Natural History in Martinsville, first
broached the idea of a major museum show, Chatham was leery.
   ``The way the so-called professional art world has operated is a
sham,'' Chatham was fond of telling friends and collectors.
``Dealers are mostly shysters, hyping bad art to people in museums
which are filled with absolute trash.''
   That attitude had turned Chatham inward, just as it had turned
off overtures from prominent dealers and art curators.
   Dismissing notions that his art would be in the mainstream, or
bring him any money, Chatham for years swore off self-promotion and
marketing of his work and became absorbed in creating it. He held
scores of one-man shows in small spaces, but refused to participate
in what he called ``everything but the kitchen sink'' art shows.
   Then, about the time Hager gave him his first one-man museum
show in 1983, Chatham got discovered and got solvent, all at the
same time.
   Today, only the artist seems surprised by the recognition.
   ``I think Russell is tremendous as an artist,'' Hager says.
``From the beginning, I knew we had to have a major Chatham in the
new facility, and I designed a space for it. When Russell first saw
it he got excited and frightened at the same time, and said, `My
God, you can see that wall for 70 feet!'
   ``But from the beginning we were clicking, and from the idea of
having one painting the project evolved into a major retrospective,
with the museum purchasing the one huge centerpiece painting and
Russell donating the other 11 in the series.''
   Although the two men agreed on $100,000 for the canvas the
museum would purchase, there was no money to pay for it during the
entire year Chatham worked on the project.
   Then, just two weeks before the show opened, the owner of Brand
S, a Livingston lumber company, donated $50,000 toward the
painting. Steven Jackson, curator of art and photography who took
over arranging the show after Hager departed, said the museum will
apply for a matching grant from the National Endowment for the Arts.
   ``I'm not concerned about the money,'' said Chatham, who never
has been.
   He still keeps his home in the $75-a-month ranch house he rented
when he arrived in the Paradise Valley in 1972. He got there in a
'49 Chevy pickup with five $l bills in his pocket, and in fact
still has the pickup, though its engine is terminally ill.
   Entering the museum, the visitor sees that huge 10-by-12-foot
painting Hager dreamed of, the same one that gave Chatham
nightmares from inception to installation.
   Entitled ``The Headwaters of the Missouri River in April,'' it
is the heart of the dozen new canvasses that will remain in the
museum's permanent collection. Those paintings compose ``The
Seasons'' suite _ one representing each month in the region formed
by the Gallatin, Madison, and Jefferson Rivers that create the
Missouri River.
   Chatham's retrospective is 100 paintings executed from 1959
through 1989. They range from tiny, early oils of Northern
California and fledgling visions of the Yellowstone Country that he
bartered away for baby-sitting services, afghans and firewood when
he was broke, to large pieces commanding thousands of dollars from
the rich and-or famous, such as actors Peter Fonda, Margot Kidder,
Harry Dean Stanton, and Jack Nicholson.
   The third gallery, on the mezzanine above the museum entrance,
features 30 paintings by Chatham's grandfather, Gottardo Piazzoni,
who executed the 14 murals in the San Francisco Library and has
been his grandson's inspiration. There will also be paintings by
his great-uncle, Maurice Del Mue, and other relatives and friends.
   ``This show is a big risk for us because it takes up all the
changing exhibition space,'' said curator Jackson. ``Russell has a
large, loyal following but it is not made up of historians,
curators, or gallery owners because he has intentionally chosen to
shun that world.
   Critic Don Berry, writing in Southwest Art Magazine, said of
Chatham:
   ``His painting concedes nothing whatever to the intellectual
fads that have dominated the fine arts in the past 40 years _ his
style remains solidly consistent, with a palette that has been
compared to a diverse group of artists, including Gauguin, Cezanne,
and Monet.''
   In U.S. Art Magazine, critic Chris Waddington wrote: ``...his
images seem to come from somewhere inside him ... commanding
technique brings him success on all levels.''
   Donna Forbes, director of the Yellowstone Art Center, wrote that
Chatham's work ``evokes the soft, exquisite manipulation of hues
and values that time works upon one special place.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Ghost Dad''</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Film opens June 29.
^By BOB THOMAS</NOTE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Want fast relief from the slam-bang, blast-'em-dead summer
movies? Then you might consider a pleasant little comedy-fantasy,
``Ghost Dad.''
   A large part of its charm lies in its very lack of pretension.
No cast of thousands. No huge sets. The only extravagance is in the
special effect of a spectral body floating on the ceiling and
slipping through floors and walls.
   Bill Cosby and Sidney Poitier stage a welcome reunion with
``Ghost Dad''; probably no director knows Cosby's comedy potential
better than his old friend. Poitier also knows the secrets of
concise storytelling. There is no waste in a Poitier film.
   As with his television counterpart, Cosby plays the father, this
time with three children: a boy-crazy teen-ager (Kimberly Russell),
a wise-eyed boy (Salim Grant) and a bright 5-year-old (Brooke
Fontaine). He's a widower whose fatherly duties sometimes take a
back seat to his demanding career in the financial world.
   Cosby is obviously doomed; after all, it's called ``Ghost Dad.''
Poitier plays with his audience, planting a roller skate at the top
of the stairs, showing elevator cables snapping. But Cosby's end
doesn't come with anything so prosaic. He takes a ride with a
crazed taxi driver (a funny bit by the whimsically named Raynor
Scheine).
   Of course, Cosby doesn't go straight to heaven or the other
place. He lands in the library of an English gent (Ian Bannen) who
tries to straighten his intermediate status. He returns to his
children, who somehow adjust to a father you can see through. It's
more difficult for his girlfriend, Denise Nicholas, when he falls
through her bed.
   Cosby faces another crisis: His children will be penniless
unless he swings a deal for his bombastic boss (Barry Corbin).
Since Cosby is visible only in the dark, it's not easy.
   Special effects aside, ``Ghost Dad'' has the homey feel of an
Andy Hardy movie. Cosby is allowed more schtick than in his TV
series, and he delivers wonderfully. Poitier integrates the flying
scenes with seamless artistry and manages to make the happy ending
believable. He also draws endearing performances from the
offspring. Kimberly Russell (``Head of the Class''), 23, even makes
a convincing teen-ager.
   The screenplay of the Universal Pictures release is credited to
Chris Reese and Brent Maddock &amp; S.S. Wilson (the ampersand denotes
a writing team). The producer: Terry Wilson. The rating is safely
PG, with seemingly little to prevent enjoyment for the whole
family. Running time: a compact 84 minutes.

   ``My Left Foot'' (HBO Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.99. Rated R)
   
   The home viewer can now see two splendid Academy Award-winning
performances on video in ``My Left Foot.''
   Daniel Day-Lewis was named best actor for his inspired portrayal
of Christy Brown, an Irish painter and writer who swilled Guinness
with the best of them while he lived his life in a wheelchair.
Brown had cerebral palsy and could paint and write only with his
left foot.
   Brenda Fricker won the best supporting actress Oscar for her
role as Brown's fiercely devoted and loving mother.
   Jim Sheridan not only molded excellent performances from the
entire cast, but has crafted a concise portrait of working-class
Dublin life. His camera squeezes us into the close living
conditions of struggling and tense families, and let's us taste the
taverns and pubs.
   Day-Lewis twists and contorts his body, face and voice. No film
actor in recent years has so controlled and shaped his acting in so
rigorous a way. It is an outstanding feat. He elicits empathy; he
commands respect.
   The movie is filled with inspirational moments, and they will
leave you breathless.

   ``She-Devil'' (Orion Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98. Rated PG-13)
   
   ``She-Devil'' is an example of ``don't fix it if ain't broke.''
   In this case, Hollywood filmmakers decided they could do a
better job than the BBC did with Faye Weldon's darkly humorous and
frightening tale, ``The Life and Loves of a She-Devil.'' The BBC
miniseries, which ran on PBS, was an awesome study of revenge and
kinkiness. It won critical raves and attracted a good following.
   Susan Seidelman's Hollywood romp with Meryl Streep and Roseanne
Barr has nothing in common with ``The Life and Loves of a
She-Devil'' except the names of the central characters. It is a
tasteless brew of watered-down pablum.
   Ruth (Barr) is a fat housewife whose husband, Bob (Ed Begley
Jr.), falls in lust with a beautiful romance writer named Mary
Fisher (Streep). Ruth decides to get even, springing the kind of
pranks that make it big on television sitcoms.
   Seidelman plays for laughs _ and they are few. She also plays
for froth. There is much. Forget substance.
   In fact, forget this video altogether. Instead, go fetch the PBS
version. This one will give you all the guts Seidelman threw down
the drain.
   In the PBS version, which closely follows Weldon's book, Ruth is
a giant of a woman and truly ugly. After her husband runs off with
the petite and pretty Mary, she burns down their house, dumps their
unruly kids on the two lovers, springs Mary's incontinent mother
from a nursing home so she can further complicate Mary's life and
sends her husband to jail.
   Ruth embarks on a life of strange and kinky crimes and starts
her own employment agency, hiring women like herself who no one
else will touch. Her goal is to raise enough money for her ultimate
plan, which is to have cosmetic surgery on her entire body so she
will look like Mary Fisher.
   The performances are a marvel, and the story will definitely put
a scare into all philanderers.

   Odes by Henry Purcell (Archiv) _ The English Concert and Choir,
directed by Trevor Pinnock.
   
   Trevor Pinnock's tasty rendition of Henry Purcell's festival
odes is among those compelling recordings that sing ``buy me!''
when played in a record shop.
   The precision and vigor of the perfomances, and the clarity and
immediacy of the recording, are instantly impressive. Surely,
however, this owes something to the composer's skills.
   The first and best known of the odes, ``Come, ye sons of art,''
was prepared for the birthday of Queen Mary II in 1694. ``Welcome
to all the pleasures'' was written in honor of the patron of music
for St. Cecilia's Day in 1683, while ``Of old, when heroes thought
it base'' was composed for some municipal bash in Yorkshire in 1690.
   The music has all the gravity, splendor and gaiety of a royal
court, thought the words be as empty as many a crowned head.
Consider this from the first ode:
   ``Strike the viol, touch the lute
   ``Wake the harp, inspire the flute.
   ``Sing your patronesses praise
   ``In cheerful and harmonious lays.''
   Purcell turns this doggerel into a moving aria for countertenor
over a dialogue between strings and woodwinds.
   Mere child's play, really, compared with the last ode, which
ends with a Chamber of Commerce-style screech: ``Long flourish the
city and county of York!''
   Purcell makes it a triumph.

   ``Louisiana Legend'' (Alligator Records) _ Raful Neal
   
   Bayou bluesman Raful Neal sings there'll be ``no cuttin'
loose,'' but that's not exactly true. There's plenty of cuttin'
lose on his ``Louisiana Legend,'' released in 1987 by
Fantastic-King Snake Records to limited distribution and reissued
this year by Alligator Records.
   This is Southern blues, so no matter how powerful the punch _
``Luberta,'' ``No Cuttin' Loose'' or ``Let's Work Together'' _ any
edge is softened by a laid-back feel. Neal's strong vocals roll
along in the same style. The whole package is topped by his fine
harp work, the crisp playing of guitarist and Neal offspring, Kenny
Neal, and the charts from The King Snake Horns.
   Neal is best known across the South, especially in his home
state of Louisiana, so for those not familiar with his 30-year
career, ``Louisiana Legend'' is a good introduction.

   The Museum of Fine Arts in Houston opened a major retrospective
of the graphic art of Jasper Johns.
   ``Jasper Johns: Printed Symbols'' features over 150 prints,
illustrated books, sculpture and proofs.
   ``He used print-making to map out new territory, exploiting the

   Johns created his first lithograph in 1960. His first print,
``Target'' was created in 1960 after he was given two lithograph
stones by the founder of Universal Limited Art Editions.
   Over the next decade, Johns created a large number of prints at
Universal, including his celebrated lithographs based on the
numerals zero through nine.

<HEAD>Star Watch: ``RoboCop'' Star Wouldn't Mind a Stint in One Place</HEAD>

   A friend once told Peter Weller that he was
``really overqualified for this kind of thing,'' referring to the
actor's most noted role, as ``RoboCop.''
   ``What do you mean?'' asked Weller.
   ``Well, you come from the theater, Actors Studio, (drama
teacher) Uta Hagen, Shakespeare and what-have-you. Why do you
always have a pistol in your hand? Why don't you re-create some
strong human dilemma?''
   ``I'll let the chips fall where they may,'' Weller replied. ``If
I read a good script and I like it, I don't look at the label on
it.''
   Weller recounted the exchange during an interview to promote
``RoboCop 2.'' He makes no excuses to his theater pals who
deprecate his portrayal of a once-deceased cop who returns in an
armored, automated body to avenge himself against the Detroit
underworld.
   ``The first `RoboCop' was the best script I'd ever read,'' he
declared. ``Plus which I was a huge fan of (Dutch director) Paul
Verhoeven. I had written his name down some years before on a list
of people I wanted to work with. I really, really wanted to do it.''
   Verhoeven was not convinced. He insisted that Weller make a test
on videotape. Weller insisted that he would not. ``I am absolutely
lousy in auditions,'' he pleaded. No amount of Dutch persuasion
could change his mind. Finally, the director cast him, no test.
   Was he reluctant to attempt a sequel?
   ``Sure. Sure. You want to think that it would be good, but
there's an apprehension about being stuck in a form with no content
_ stuck in the same can of beans with none of the charge that
turned you on to the first one.
   What convinced him was ``a great script.'' In ``RoboCop 2,''
which was directed by Irvin Kershner, Weller is fighting not only
the crime barons but his own obsolescence. Omni Consumer Products,
which created the original machine, has devised a new model without
a human inside, and it is programmed to wipe out its predecessor.
   At least in the first film, Weller had early scenes as patrolman
Alex J. Murphy. In the new one he is inside the RoboCop suit,
acting only with his eyes and voice.
   ``I didn't give that much thought,'' he said. ``I figured if I
was doing the right thing, people would get it. If I didn't, they
wouldn't.''
   Nancy Allen, who portrays his ex-partner, Anne Lewis, agrees
that Weller did the right thing.
   ``Peter made my job a lot easier, because he is very convincing.
The costume is very convincing. There's just that tiny little strip
that I'm constantly trying to see, searching for him in his eyes.
It really works well and makes it that much more believable.''
   Weller had an ever-moving childhood. The son of an Army
helicopter pilot, he was born in Wisconsin and was repeatedly
uprooted as his father changed stations.
   ``I'm sure it's a good background for an actor, makes you pretty
resilient,'' said the slim, tall, 43-year-old actor whose bland
face is dominated by intense blue eyes.
   ``Albert Camus said the only real existentialist is either the
traveler or the actor, because they are constantly superimposing
their existence moment-by-moment on other existences. Maybe they're
hand-in-hand: the traveler and the actor. I don't think there's a
lot of security in either _ our notion of security; in the Zen
sense, it's probably the most secure of all.
   ``(Moving from place to place) was a drag, man, just a drag. It
was a drag leaving people, too. It was sad. But the good news was
that I learned to deal with loss and the moment of change with a
little more facility than other people I know.''
   Weller's travels stopped briefly while he attended North Texas
State University, where he majored in playing trumpet in jazz
bands. He also dabbled in acting and left for a scholarship at the
American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York. Just before
graduating, he drew his first professional acting job, playing the
son in David Rabe's Vietnam play ``Sticks and Bones'' for Joe
Papp's company. He'll return next year for a revival of the play,
this time as the father.
   His film debut came in 1979 with ``Butch and Sundance: The Early
Years.'' After other undistinguished films, he finally registered
in ``The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai: Across the 8th Dimension,''
the eccentric fantasy that attracted a flock of cultists.
   Weller's film and stage assignments continue the pattern of his
youth: ``Man, I haven't stayed in one place yet. I got an airline
ticket in my hand right now. I used to like it that way. Now I
don't. At this very moment in time I don't. Maybe tomorrow I will.
   ``I'd like to have a family, children, be in one place. Or be
grounded in a series of places. Some day.''

   The world's three top tenors, Jose Carreras,
Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti, will sing in concert
together at the Baths of Caracalla in Rome.
   Wow.
   ``That's what everybody says,'' beams Carreras. ``Me, too.''
   The July 7 concert will be filmed and recorded.
   ``Each of us are going to sing arias and songs by ourselves,''
Carreras says. ``Then at the end we prepare a medley of popular
pieces like `O Solo Mio' and `Maria' from `West Side Story' or
`Because.' We'll trade singing a few bars, each of us, and maybe at
the end we finish together, with Pavarotti the highest, of course.
   ``I hope for people all over the world the live broadcast is
going to be fun. For sure, nobody is going to have more fun than we
are going to have. In the meetings we had already, we've had a lot
of fun.''
   Carreras, who plans to donate his part of the proceeds to the
Jose Carreras International Foundation for Leukemia Research, was
interviewed shortly before his June 7 Carnegie Hall recital to
benefit the foundation. Ticket prices ranged from $20 to $600.
   The tenor, who was diagnosed with leukemia in July 1987, started
the foundation in his native Spain in July 1988, after he'd been
successfully treated.
   Some $6 million has been raised. The money is used primarily for
scientific research. ``We're so arrogant, we even gave money to the
United States,'' Carreras said with a laugh, ``two grants of
$25,000 each to the American Society of Hematology.''
   Money also is going to a cooperative bone marrow-transplant
project between a Barcelona hospital and the Fred Hutchinson
Hospital in Seattle where Carreras' bone marrow was removed,
treated and replaced.
   Now he feels good and is back to a normal private and performing
life, except that some 15 of his concerts over the last two years
have been benefits. ``I'm out of any treatment or restriction from
the doctors,'' he says. ``I have a blood test every eight weeks,
for control.'' His hair has returned, with a slightly higher
forehead.
   During his bone marrow removal and replacement, ``Domingo
traveled to Seattle to spend some hours with me, and Luciano kept
calling me, being so funny as he can be, sending messages of moral
support.''
   Carreras, whose first post-leukemia performance was in Barcelona
in July 1988, sang here last summer and was reviewed favorably. At
first, he was frightened to try singing. ``I was so scared I
decided to do it in my bathroom. There the sound is always a little
bit better because of the resonance.
   ``The doctor said, `Don't do it.' How can a singer avoid this
temptation, when you start to feel better at last and you can walk
and talk and you're able to take a shower. You're in there. And
now, let's see.
   ``Slowly, I started singing for myself, at first only 10 or 15
minutes a day. Then with my pianist, until the moment I was able to
sing from beginning to end the first aria in `Aida.' If a tenor can
sing that, he can sing anything else.''
   Carreras has two new recordings out, one of songs by Italian
opera composers and one of Andrew Lloyd Webber songs. He also has
recorded ``Tosca'' with Eva Marton and conductor Michael Tilson
Thomas and ``Samson and Dalila'' with Agnes Balsa and conductor Sir
Colin Davis.
   When he returned to performing, it was in recitals. Then he
added operas, singing in ``Medee'' by Cherubini at an outdoor
amphitheater in Merida, Spain _ ``where the jet set of Roman
society 2,000 years ago used to retire, a kind of Miami.''
   He sang in ``Carmen'' in Tokyo and Vienna and the premiere of
Leonardo Balada's ``Cristobal Colon'' in Barcelona, his first
contemporary music. There are plans for Carreras to sing that title
role again in Washington, Columbus, Ohio, San Antonio and
California.
   After he recorded ``Samson,'' Carreras decided to sing the part
for the first time on stage this summer in Barcelona. ``I think I
have the voice,'' he says. ``The only dramatic moment musically is
the second act duet with Dalila. The density of the orchestra is
great. The second act prayer has sadness and desperation in the
voice but nothing to do with a dramatic orchestra.
   ``There is a cliche Samson has to be 190 pounds,'' says
Carreras, who is more slight than that. ``I think Samson is a
character you can play thinking about his mysticism. He is the
leader of these people because of his spiritual strength and
religious belief.''
   In July, Carreras will sing in Massenet's ``Herodiade'' in
Merida. Next season, he'll sing in ``Pagliacci'' in Barcelona,
``Samson'' in London, ``La Boheme'' and ``Carmen'' in Vienna. In
1992, at La Scala, he'll sing in ``Fedora,'' which he has recorded
with Marton but not sung on stage.
   After his recital here, Carreras went to San Francisco to film
``Missa Creolas'' in a mission. ``I have an appointment with
somebody from the opera. I want to go back to San Francisco, even
if I know that it doesn't pay to come to the United States to sing
opera. This is not the most important thing.''
   He lives in Barcelona, has a wife, and a son, 17, and daughter,
11. ``They both study music but don't show any special talent,'' he
says. ``They're going to be normal people.''
   Carreras did not lose religious faith while he was so sick. ``I
think my faith grew after that. I have to be honest.
   ``At the beginning after you recover, you think your life is
going to change dramatically. Slowly, slowly, slowly, you go back
to the same mistakes. What was your plan for a fantastic new life,
you keep your word for only 20 percent.
   ``But this 20 percent is a big change. In many things, you
probably see things from a more relaxing, quiet, peaceful way. You
have time to think about certain things. Before, they were there
but you didn't notice it maybe.
   ``After such an extreme moment of your life, you become more
mature for the important things in life. What is wonderful is that
after such a bad period, many of the conclusions are very positive,
so that if life was wonderful before, now it is 100 percent
wonderful. In so many aspects, I think I'm richer inside.''

   This really is a scary town. Just ask New Kids
on the Block. They felt safe in their midtown hotel, confident
their fans had camped out elsewhere, and even considered slipping
out for pizza.
   But it wasn't safe. Fourteen girls had staked out the right
hotel. ``Jennifer, I know they're in there right now,'' one girl
said urgently to her comrades as they camped on the street.
   Be brave, Kids; don't panic. In a few years, those girls won't
even remember your names.
   ``By the time tonight is over, they'll catch on where we are and
there'll be 100 girls out here,'' says Jonathan Knight, 21.
   ``We've had girls dress up as maids to try to sneak into our
hotel rooms. Once, in Atlanta, I was on the 25th floor of a hotel,
lying in bed, hearing girls screaming.
   ``I couldn't understand where it was coming from. I looked out.
They had paid construction workers to take them up in a building
being built across the street so they could look in our windows. I
waved and shut my curtains. I think the police had to come.''
   Jordan Knight and Donnie Wahlberg, both 20, and Jonathan Knight
agreed to an interview while Joe McIntyre, 17, slept and Danny
Wood, 20, worked out at a gym. Jordan and Donnie arrived almost two
hours late, ready to drop from the tight tour schedule.
   ``Today we hosted MTV and Saturday Night Videos and did a lot of
IDs for different radio stations across America and for a lot of
video outlets,'' said Jordan. ``It was a busy day. Tomorrow morning
we fly to London.'' They performed in four German cities, seven
British cities and did promotional events in Madrid, Milan,
Amsterdam, Paris and Rome.
   New Kids on the Block is the biggest-selling band in the land,
with a new record and video and another leg of a seemingly endless
tour. Columbia Records shipped a new single, ``Step by Step,'' on
May 9. It sold more than 1 million copies in less than a week.
   The company's initial release of the ``Step by Step'' album on
June 5 was more than 2 million. A 50-minute video also was released
June 5, the biggest initial release in CBS video history, breaking
the record of ``Hangin' Tough Live,'' New Kids on the Block's last
long-form video, which has sold more than 1.1 million copies.
   The tiny tots who love to scream along with New Kids' tunes will
have plenty of time to learn the lyrics because the group will be
touring stadiums through Sept. 15.
   The bucks are pouring in for the test-tube band. They're paid
$125,000 per concert, and sell equally as much offstage in
souvenirs. Merchandise licensed to 25 manufacturers can be found in
stores. The group also will make commercials for Coca-Cola, will
launch New Kids dolls in August, debut in a Saturday morning
cartoon series in September and star in a movie in the fall.
   ``The cartoon people came out on the road with us for a month
and learned our personalities and habits so that the cartoon is
going to be a strong reflection of our personal lives,'' Jonathan
said.
   New Kids on the Block, the idea of Boston-based music
entrepreneur Maurice Starr, who also started New Edition, is
discounted by some as a ``made'' group, and derided by others as
another example of white people taking black music and making the
big money from it.
   Despite all the acclaim and fame (if they're too busy for
television, then TV talk types will interview their mothers) and
money, Wahlberg is bugged by the group getting what he considers a
bum rap. They work hard, always have; they've been on the road for
most of the last four years. Before they were famous, they toured
as an opening act for Tiffany. They don't play instruments but
dance and do their own singing. The group's top management people
are black. So are on-stage musicians, presenting visible racial
harmony.
   Wahlberg eats oysters he has ordered from room service and
launches into a lengthy monologue: ``As I find myself growing up, I
find myself focusing more on trying to speak out and fight more for
things I believe in. I like to show older people I'm not just a
brainless little puppet of Maurice Starr.
   ``I think the media has turned our image into the image of milk
and cookies. I'm not necessarily about milk and cookies. I'm about
positivity. I talk to writers who turn around and write articles of
only criticisms about our young fans and how much money we're
supposed to be making and selling a lot of merchandise and getting
a lot of exposure; and we're clean-cut guys who've been marketed to
suit whoever's needs, and nothing about the positivity of the group.
   ``I haven't been contrived, brainwashed or molded by anyone but
my parents. I'm nobody's puppet.
   ``I think a lot of critics see us as Maurice Starr's brainchild
and any success we have is ... not due to us. He writes songs. I
wrote two songs on the album. I've written on every album. Jordan
and myself produced two songs on Tommy Page's album. I feel like I
shouldn't have to sit here and bring these things up and say I've
done this and that to get critics' respect. If I don't write and
produce every song, why does that irk people so much? Most actors
don't write and direct their movies.
   ``If they say, `These kids have no talent,' that's totally
untrue. ... We have Maurice Starr, but every group has a mentor and
started from an idea. U2 was somebody's idea. Starr isn't on stage
every night. We work. To take so much heat and flack, sometimes it
annoys me.
   ``I read reviews of the show and the first line says, `those
annoying girls.'''
   Wahlberg, who says he reads newspapers every day, wants it known
that he's interested in important things. ``The issue I find myself
dealing with most is racism. America isn't a racist society the way
it used to be, but racism is still flourishing in our society. The
most important thing anyone can do today is try to be open-minded
and try to educate themselves on things like racism.''

   New Kids often receive the same criticism as Elvis Presley, who
sang black performers' songs and became far more famous than those
who first performed them, such as Big Mama Thornton and ``Hound
Dog.'' But he paid to cut his first record, in the style he liked
to sing, as a present for his mother.
   Wahlberg says the New Kids grew up listening to black radio
stations in Boston. ``I respect the roots of the music I perform,''
he said. ``I feel like I'm not stealing it. The music I do is music
I grew up listening to.''
   Adolescent girls loved Elvis in the 1950s, the Beatles in the
'60s and the Rolling Stones in the '70s; now they adore the New
Kids.
   But times have changed. Drugs and promiscuity are no longer in.
The New Kids sing about romance, lasting love and self-reliance.
Wahlberg says from the stage, ``Thank you for staying drug free.''
   Three books about the band are on paperback best-seller lists,
and fans salivate for every nugget about the quintet's personal
lives. Wahlberg isn't in love at the moment. Jonathan Knight has
the same girlfriend he had before the group started.
   The story of New Kids on the Block dates back to 1985 in Boston
where Maurice Starr worked. He was a man of ideas as well as a
facile songwriter, and had put together groups before, none meeting
with wild success. First he thought he and his brothers could be
another Jackson 5. Then he heard four young singers called the New
Edition, signed them and shepherded them through their first album.
They sued him for their release and won, on the basis that they
were minors when they signed.
   Starr put together a trio and managed a funk quartet. Next he
had the idea that a white group, singing music like the New
Edition, with choreography like the Motown groups in their heyday,
could appeal to white as well as the New Edition's black listeners.
He found four boys in Boston high schools, none of them aiming
toward a show business career. He found 12-year-old Joe McIntyre
last, younger and smaller than the rest, the Michael Jackson of the
latter-day Jackson 5 idea he never abandoned.
   New Kids wasn't an overnight success. Its first record was
marketed by Columbia Records to black radio, which wasn't crazy
about it. A station in Tampa, Fla., aimed at white listeners picked
up on ``Please Don't Go, Girl'' from the second album, ``Hangin'
Tough,'' in March 1988, and the group took off.
   Starr, however, isn't resting on his laurels. He put together a
trio, Perfect Gentlemen, which opened New Kids' shows in the winter
tour. ``They're 12, 11 and 13,'' Knight says. ``Just having them
around brings back a lot of memories, stuff they're going through
now that we went through. Their fans are younger than ours. We have
fans from 4 to grandmothers but predominately it's 13 to 18.''
   On this summer's tour, Perfect Gentlemen will open again, along
with Tommy Page, who co-wrote his single ``I'll Be Your
Everything'' with two of the New Kids, and the latest protege,
16-year-old Rick Wes, whom Starr thinks can become another Elvis.
   New Kids on the Block are prisoners of their own fame when
they're on the road, but Jonathan Knight says he doesn't mind. ``We
can't leave the hotel because it's so crazy outside. We usually
sleep most of the day, wake up around 2 and get dressed and lounge
around. The sound check is usually around 4. After the show we'll
all party pretty much all night, eating and watching a movie. It
depends. Sometimes we'll go crash in somebody else's room or in our
own.''
   If the next concert is in a different town, they'll sometimes
get on the bus and travel all night.
   ``We sightsee out the window, that's about it,'' Jonathan said.
``We have our own buses custom built for us, with beds and TVs and
bathrooms and microwaves. We buy microwave pizzas and pre-made
stuff.
   ``Everywhere we go, girls are out in front. We have jealous
boyfriends pull up in front of our houses at 3 in the morning,
screaming at the top of their lungs. We learn to live with it. The
good things far outweigh the bad things.''
   When the first album didn't sell hugely, Jonathan said, ``Our
manager (Starr) was telling us we have to wait our turn. As long as
we keep working hard and doing the best we can do, our dreams will
come true. He's always positive, about everything.''
   During the two-week vacation before going to Europe, Wahlberg
worked on producing two new groups, the West Side Boys and Marky
Mark and the Funky Bunch, the latter his 18-year-old brother, Mark,
who was in New Kids for six months then dropped out because he was
more interested in basketball. Wahlberg also has three sisters and
four brothers older than himself.
   During those two weeks, Jonathan worked in his yard until 4 a.m.
``I've got those night-owl eyes,'' he says. ``I was out there,
putting in a pond, planting bushes, getting the yard ready. Me and
Jordan just bought a house for our family.'' They have two sisters
and two more brothers at home. ``They're not jealous. They know God
carved out my life to do what I'm doing and they have their special
place in life to fulfill their dreams.
   ``We all still live with our families. We want to have our
families benefit from what we've accomplished. I helped one sister
buy a car. Donnie bought a house and Danny, I believe, bought his
parents' house from them and redid it for them. Joe still lives in
an apartment building with his mom.''
   Joe McIntyre, who has one more year of high school, travels with
a tutor who also gives classes to anyone who wants them. Knight
studied computers and Wood studied nutrition.
   ``We'll be together for awhile,'' Knight says. ``Old Kids on the
Block.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: A Happy Family?</HEAD>

   Sue Miller admits she made a ``huge, false
start'' on her new novel. For hundreds of pages she wrote about a
subject she knew would bore herself and readers as well: a happy
family.
   ``It could have been a very happy book where the mother stays at
home and is very happy with the three children,'' Miller said of
``Family Pictures'' ($19.95, Harper and Row), in which a family's
life is disrupted by the birth of an autistic child.
   ``If the child had not been born autistic I wouldn't have
written about the family. People don't write books about happy
families. It is true that fiction focuses on hardship.
   ``I think in some way or another writers are just interested in
watching how people change or don't grow in hardship. That's
usually a premise in every single book,'' said Miller, author of
the best-selling ``The Good Mother.''
   So here's a novel about a family, unique in the way that all
unhappy families are unique. David and Lainey Eberhardt live in
Chicago with their two children, Mack and Liddie. They're
wonderfully, undramatically happy.
   But their third child, Randall, is autistic. It's the 1950s, a
time when little was understood about that condition. David, a
psychiatrist, blames Lainey. Though they have three more children _
Nina, Mary and Sarah _ the marriage falls apart.
   ``I feel the particular time and place, the particular set of
values, the psychiatric wisdom of the time has an unbelieveable
impact on the family. It's absolutely of this world, of its time,''
said Miller, who grew up in Chicago in the '50s and '60s and was
the second of four children.
   ``David has the attitude that orthodox psychiatry had about
autism, and he would have been less likely to sustain those beliefs
in another time,'' she said, referring to his attitude that the
autism was caused by the mother's behavior.
   ``I think also the very life of that family, the father who
works, the mother whose life is her children, is very much that
particular period. Also, the father who is the authoritative figure
who understands the world, who analyzes the world, while women were
supposedly incapacitated by their emotions.''
   ``Family Pictures'' tells of action and reflection, the chapters
arranged in time like the pages of a family album. Miller shows her
characters lying awake in bed, rehashing events; at bars dousing
themselves with beer, or stealing away from parties to be alone
with their thoughts.
   The novel begins with Nina recalling Mack's 14th birthday,
during which Randall, amazingly, utters ``Happy birthday, dear
Mackie.'' At least, that's how Nina remembers it. Her mother
insists it never happened, that Randall stopped speaking when he
was 4, and Liddie is sure she's the one who should be telling the
story.
   ``But that's the way it is in a family, isn't it?'' Miller
writes. ``The stories get passed around, polished, embellished.
Liddie's version or Mack's version changes as it becomes my
version.''
   ``Family Pictures'' is Miller's version. Stories are borrowed
from her own life and others. She writes about family outings,
baseball games, a Chicago college house and the casual cruelty of
teen-age boys.
   ``I do think that it's probably easier for women now to imagine
being male than it was 25 or 35 years ago. The way women are now
raised to think about their sexuality has really shifted
enormously,'' Miller said.
   ``I think that more and more we at least understand and are
familiar with the other sex. Women live more like men. They have
much more freedom. It possibly has made a women fiction writer's
life easier.''
   Miller, a single parent for 12 years now living with her second
husband, rejects the idea that men are more capable of writing
about the ``real'' world _the workplace and wars _ while women are
better off with the ``inner'' world of family novels.
   She observes that classic 19th-century novels such as ``Anna
Karenina'' and ``Madame Bovary'' were ``only'' about families, yet
so rooted in a place and time they defined a whole society as well.
   ``It seems to me the family novel can raise rather large social
issues as well as rather large philosophical issues. In the 19th
century, the people who wrote were often gentlemen, so they didn't
have the rough, tough world to write about.
   ``They didn't write about the office. They tended to write about
dinner parties. They tended to write about adulteries. It's a shame
that it's so divided now. It's seen as this radical, feminist
thing.''
   In ``The Good Mother,'' a woman divorces her lawyer husband and
begins a passionate affair with an artist. When her ex-husband
accuses her lover of ``sexual irregularities,'' a bitter custody
battle ensues for their 4-year-old daughter. The title becomes
ironic. Can a woman be a ``good mother'' and still enjoy full
sexual freedom?
   ``Family Pictures,'' is ironic, too, the story delivering little
of the cozy warmth promised by the title, like finding graffiti on
the back of an old framed portrait.
   In both novels, Miller concentrates on the uneasy partnership of
public and private, moving from office rooms to bedrooms, tracing
the confusing, intricate paths of the legal and medical professions
and showing how they can alter the fine print of the human heart.
   ``I feel very connected to particular social issues,'' Miller
said. ``I'm very interested in the way the law interacts with human
life, the emotional life of human beings. And I think it's almost
criminal the particular stance psychiatry took on autism. This was
an error.''
   ``For every writer, there's the question of what will people
struggle with, what will be the hard thing that happens that people
will have to grow around or be defeated by. In `Family Pictures,' I
wanted it to happen over a long period of time. I wanted the way
they thought about it to shift and change.''

   Travis Tritt figures living off canned
vienna sausages for a few years was worth it while he tried to get
his country music career going.
   Today he's one of several fresh faces on the country-western
scene who are supplanting the old guard like Waylon Jennings and
Johnny Cash at the top of the popularity charts.
   Tritt's ``Help Me Hold On'' was a No. 1 country music single in
May. His debut album, ``Country Club,'' could be a gold LP (sales
of one-half million) by fall.
   The album has reached higher on the country music charts than
the highly promoted ``Highwayman 2'' LP by country kings Willie
Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, Jennings and Cash.
   ``These are guys I've idolized,'' Tritt, 27, said in an
interview during a frenzied 16-hour work day. ``It's almost
mind-boggling. It's like you've cheated nature.''
   Six years ago, Tritt quit his $400-a-week job as an assistant
manager for a Marietta, Ga., company that distributes heating and
air-conditioning equipment.
   He yearned to sing professionally _ a beckoning that began at
age 8 when he taught himself to play guitar. So he gave up job
security to sing at night in American Legion halls for pay that
would hardly cover necessities.
   ``I would go to the grocery store once a week and buy canned
vienna sausage, a head of lettuce, a jar of mayonnaise, a loaf of
bread and two or three cans of soup,'' he recalled. ``This was
breakfast, lunch and dinner for the entire week. It's all I could
afford.''
   Several times, he nearly gave up singing in order to return to a
more normal job with better benefits and pay.
   ``You almost have to have as much patience as you do talent,''
Tritt recalled.
   He finally hooked up with Warner Bros. Records and gained
recognition this year as one of country music's rising stars.
   His album contains mainly blue collar anthems celebrating a
carefree Southern lifestyle characterized by relentless drinking,
the joy of driving pickup trucks and the relaxation of shooting
pool. His lyrical themes are much like those of another Dixie
firebrand, Hank Williams Jr.
   But his No. 1 record had a tender touch _ a plea to his lover
not to leave him.
   His next single release, ``I'm Gonna Be Somebody,'' documents
the struggle of a singer who becomes successful after 10 years and
the subsequent envy of someone just like him.
   His style is hard-core country music with fiddles, steel guitars
and a harmonica.
   ``I do music that turns me on,'' said the bearded, mustachioed
Tritt. ``I figure if it does, it will turn others on too. I think
we've struck a nerve with a part of middle America that really is
looking for honesty in music. We've struck a chord with a younger
audience as well.
   ``The music deals with real situations, real people, everyday,
ordinary life. You don't have to be a poetry major or literature
student to understand country music.''
   Tritt has bought a touring bus owned previously by a succession
of country stars including Randy Travis, Merle Haggard and Conway
Twitty.
   He has been the opening act for several concerts headlined by
the Charlie Daniels Band. Daniels has become a friend and adviser.
   Tritt's ``Help Me Hold On'' was his first No. 1 record and his
second single record released. It's the song that ignited his
career.
   ``That song has tripled or quadrupled our audience. It's
wonderful to have that kind of response,'' he said. ``It makes you
want to stop and pinch yourself.''

   Art from Cuba is exempt from the trade embargo,
say artists, galleries, scholars and a civil liberties group who
are suing the Bush administration for banning it.
   The lawsuit filed June 5 charged that the Treasury Department is
violating a 1988 law that excludes paintings, sculpture and
drawings by Cubans from the 27-year-old U.S. embargo against Cuba's
goods. The suit said the department has infringing on the First
Amendment.
   ``Paintings are as much a part of the First Amendment as books.
They are not, as the administration would have it, commodities like
Cuban sugar or tobacco,'' said Michael Krinsky, a lawyer for the
National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee.
   Joining with the NECLC in the legal action were the New
York-based Center for Cuban Studies, several artists, art scholars,
galleries and private collectors. Sotheby's and Christie's auction
houses also joined as ``friends of the court'' in support of the
plaintiffs.
   The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, asked
that the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control be
required to permit Cuban art works to be brought into the country
under the ``free trade in ideas'' act, adopted by Congress in 1988.

   ``The Godfather, Part III,'' one of the most
talked about movies of the year, has finished principal photography
in Italy, New York and Atlantic City.
   The last in a trilogy about the fictional Corleone family poses
a challenge for filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola since both ``The
Godfather'' (1972) and ``The Godfather, Part II'' (1974) won best
picture Academy Awards.
   But Paramount Pictures thinks it might have yet another winner.
   ``We are excited by the incredible look, texture and intrigue of
the continuing saga,'' said Sidney Ganis, president of Paramount's
Motion Picture Group.
   ``The Godfather, Part III,'' which is scheduled for release at
Christmas, begins in 1979. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is trying
to legitimize the family's dirty money. He's moved from gambling
and casino operations to real estate and media.
   The film began shooting in Rome on Nov. 27, 1989. It ended May
25.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Freshman Lawmaker Sparks Bailout as Political
Issue</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's savings and loan disaster finally
exploded on Capitol Hill as a political issue after a freshman
Republican lawmaker provided the spark.
   Congress has been wrestling with the problem since the S&amp;L
industry's government-backed insurance fund went belly up at the
end of the Reagan administration. Tens of billions of dollars are
being spent to bail out, close down and sell off thrift
institutions.
   Though costly, it seemed for the longest time that President
Bush's effort to keep the issue quiet was the best strategy.
   Oh sure, it's expensive, the White House said. But let's keep it
off the books, not count it against our deficit-reduction efforts,
remember that a lot of it is just ``working capital.''
   Congress, unable to find a good alternative, went along,
although trouble flared up sporadically for some lawmakers.
   A handful of senators _ the so-called Keating Five _ are under
investigation because of their extraordinary efforts on behalf of
one spectacularly failed thrift. Some House members seeking
re-election his year are under attack for their ties to financial
institutions.
   But for the most part, lawmakers who weren't personally involved
in the issue appeared to be standing back.
   Then this spring something changed, and the issue seemed to
reach critical mass.
   Perhaps it was the nearness of the elections. There's a chance
it was the cumulative effect of never-ending bad news and
escalating costs.
   And just maybe the public began to catch on that, whatever the
bookkeeping tricks, more of their federal tax dollars would be
going to bail out inept or crooked thrift operations than, say, to
education.
   Enter Peter Smith, a first-term Republican congressman from
Vermont who reached the House in a three-way race where the
Democrat and a Socialist split the majority of the vote.
   ``I basically blew my stack,'' Smith says.
   Two weeks ago Smith introduced a resolution in the House calling
for the appointment of a special prosecutor, known officially as an
independent counsel, to go after the savings and loans.
   The measure would have no binding effect, and in some ways is
flawed. An independent counsel can be requested simply by a
majority of either the Republicans or the Democrats on the
congressional judiciary committees.
   ``But a freshman doesn't move the committee structure,'' Smith
said.
   And the purpose of the law is to address conflicts of interest
the Justice Department would have investigating the Bush
administration, not to balkanize federal enforcement efforts for
every issue that comes along.
   ``When you're talking about Congress and high-ranking government
officials, I think the conflict exists,'' Smith said.
   His resolution immediately touched off lawmakers starving for a
way to look tough on the issue. By late last week, more than 170
House members were cosponsoring his resolution.
   Even though the resolution could rightly be seen as a vote of no
confidence in the administration and especially Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh, Republicans were embracing Smith as a hero.
   ``My sense is the Justice Department has moved slowly. ... If my
resolution has something to do with (prodding) those people, then I
think it's a good thing,'' Smith said. ``I'm just sorry it took so
long.''
   When Smith scheduled a news conference on his resolution last
week, he expected three colleagues to join him. Instead 17 showed
up, among them House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., a top
backer of the Reagan administration's S&amp;L deregulation that
Democrats say led to the financial disaster.
   Whether or not a special prosecutor is appointed, it now appears
clear that Congress will take some sort of action this year.
   Savings and loan operators now are rivaling drug dealers as
Congress' glamour criminals.
   Top Democrats and Republicans on the House Banking Committee
last week introduced legislation to bolster Justice Department
enforcement and give the federal government new powers to chase
down some of the money embezzled from the savings institutions.
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del.,
announced a crackdown bill of his own and attacked the
administration for cutting back the FBI's budget request for
hundreds of new agents for the crisis.
   ``I have succeeded beyond my wildest dreams,'' Smith said.

   Retail prices rose a modest 0.2 percent in
May, easing the strain on consumers' budgets after a painful spurt
in prices early in the year, the government said.
   The April and May moderation in the Labor Department's Consumer
Price Index curbed inflation for the first five months of the year
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.8 percent.
   That's up significantly from the 4.6 percent rate for all of
last year, but down sharply from the worrisome 8.5 percent rate in
the first quarter. The latest figures were released Friday.

<HEAD>A High-Tech Sense of Touch Promises Bright Future For Young
Company</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interlink Electronics, a young company with
a high-tech sense of touch, has its fingers in everything from
aerospace to computers, music and sports.
   Interlink's biggest problem, in fact, might be developing all
the potential uses of its patented ``force sensing resistors,''
which translate touch into electronic signals.
   ``One of the things that's a plague to us as a small company is
the sensors fit in so many markets that people don't know what to
make of us,'' said Kathryn Stewart, vice president of sales and
marketing of the 5-year-old, Santa Barbara-based company.
   Nicknamed ``the electronic gas pedal,'' a force sensing resistor
is a tactile sensor that responds with variable resistance. The
harder this thick polymer film is pressed, the more its resistance
drops.
   Interlink on Friday introduced its first high-volume consumer
product, an electronic keyboard foot-pedal that is part of the
``Miracle Piano Teaching System.'' The system combines a cartridge
for the Nintendo Entertainment System with a keyboard and home
television to create game-like video piano lessons.
   That modest step into consumer electronics is only a hint of
Interlink's future. The privately held company also is targetting
aerospace, where its sensors are used to determine whether the
various layers of airplane composite materials are being joined
evenly.
   Among the aerospace companies experimenting with the devices are
Boeing Co., Northrop Corp. and McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   That business represents about one-fifth of Interlink's expected
$2.7 million in sales this year, said President E. Michael Thoben
III.
   Three other key markets for Interlink are computer input
devices, such as a stationary mouse for Apple Computer Inc.'s
MacIntosh Portable, sensing components on electronic drums and
musical keyboards, and rugged keypads for automatic teller machines.
   Thoben told the company's shareholders at an annual meeting
Thursday that Interlink will concentrate on those four markets to
build up revenue over the next few years.
   ``We're in transition from a research and development concern to
one driven by the market,'' said Thoben.
   Interlink also makes a touch interpreting sensor for a robot, a
device that fits under the grip of a golf club to analyze a
player's swing, footplates for medical analysis of podiatry
problems, and bed or wheelchair position monitors.
   But even that array of products just hints at the applications
that have been pursued by Interlink, which is backed by the funding
of Grace Ventures Corp., a unit of W.R. Grace &amp; Co.
   Imagine an electronic tennis referee so accurate it could shut
up John McEnroe. Interlink began work on a system proposed by a
customer, which got good reviews from the U.S. Tennis Association.
But the project is on hold until the customer can raise enough
money to fund further research.
   The biomedical industry is interested in Interlink sensors to
provide feedback for dispensing diagnostic and rehabilitative
functions. The sensors also can be applied to the automotive
industry in window, mirror and audio controls, as well as tire,
brake and fuel level sensors.
   The company, which has only 50 U.S. employees, grew out of an
idea developed by inventor Franklin Eventoff in the 1970s. Eventoff
was trying to make a musical toy for his daughter when he created a
way to generate an electronic response when varying degrees of
pressure were applied to a sensor.
   Eventoff patented the invention and formed a company, then sold
off most of the company. He remains a major shareholder.
   Interlink has refined and improved the sensors and now holds 33
patents in 10 countries.

   The midmorning release of the government figures discouraged
buying.

<HEAD>Non-Contract UAL Employees Unhappy With Participation in Buyout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STANLEY D. MILLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a potential setback for a union group seeking
to buy UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, a group of non-contract
employees says time is running out for the buyout group to accept
their proposals.
   The non-contract employees said in a news release Sunday they
had developed a package of wage concessions, benefit modifications
and other elements under which they could support the buyout plan.
   But the United Employee Acquisition Corp., the entity formed by
the unions to handle the proposed $4.54 billion buyout, has not
agreed to the package, a news release from System Roundtable said.
   System Roundtable is the top rung of a series of groups of
non-contract employees which effectively has become the
non-contract employees' bargaining agent in the buyout effort.
   Their support is not essential to the proposed deal but the
opposition of non-contract employees could complicate the unions'
attempts to raise financing.
   The buyout group's contract to buy UAL will lapse if financing
is not obtained by Aug. 10. If financing is secured, the group
would have until the end of the year to close the deal.
   Under the agreement approved April 6 by UAL's board, United's
pilots would own 37.9 percent of the company's stock, machinists
would own 35.7 percent, non-contract employees would get 14.3
percent and United flight attendants would own 12 percent.
   In the news release, System Roundtable said, ``We are very
disappointed. We think it is particularly disturbing that UEAC has
not yet been able to resolve the issues relating to the
non-contract employees.
   ``It is also surprising that agreement on this package, which is
a test of UEAC's check and balance governance system, has not yet
been finalized,'' the release said.
   ``If this package is not agreed to very shortly by UEAC, it does
not bode well for UEAC's ability to make the business judgments
that it will certainly face in trying to finance the proposed
leveraged buyout, and, if that transaction is completed, in running
the airline,'' the release said.
   Hank Krakowski, a spokesman for the UEAC, declined to comment on
System Roundtable's stance and said he was not familiar with the
package of terms.
   Non-contract workers comprise over one-third of UAL's total work
force of about 71,500 people. They include reservations and ticket
agents, professional and technical staffers, and management and
supervisors excluding Chairman Stephen Wolf and other top officers.
   The union group includes the Air Line Pilots Association,
machinists and the Association of Flight Attendants.
   The union group has proposed overall employee wage and benefit
cuts totaling $2 billion over five years to offset buyout costs.
   At UAL Corp.'s annual meeting April 26, Daryl Thorogood, a
United reservations agent from San Francisco, said the exclusion of
salaried and management employees from buyout negotiations was
``rude, illegal and undemocratic.''
   Ms. Thorogood said the non-contract employees have had no voice
in deciding how much they will give up.

   Evangeline Johnson Merrill, the last surviving
child of Johnson &amp; Johnson co-founder Robert Wood Johnson, died at
age 93 in North Carolina, the New York Times reported.
   Mrs. Merrill died Sunday at the Bryan Health Care Center in
Hendersonville, N.C., as a result of injuries suffered in a fall
earlier this year, the report said.
   She was born in New Brunswick, N.J. in 1897. In World War I,
Mrs. Merrill worked in the Red Cross Ambulance Corps and was
decorated by President Woodrow Wilson.
   She was also a prominent figure in the arts. In 1943, she was
made a fellow in perpetuity at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and
she was a patron of the Peabody Museum of Yale University.
   In the 1920s, Mrs. Merrill fought the town of Palm Beach, Fla.,
by protesting a ban on women wearing abbreviated bathing suits. Her
method of protest included dropping handbills on the beach from a
small plane she piloted, The Times said.
   Mrs. Merrill is survived by her third husband, Charles Merrill,
two daughters and five grandchildren.

<HEAD>OPEC Chief Warns of Serious Oil Price Slide if Output Not Cut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC President Sadek Boussena has warned
the cartel that oil prices will collapse if the organization's
members do not adhere to a production cutback agreement, the Middle
East Economic Survey reported Monday.
   The oil industry newsletter, published in Nicosia, said that
Boussena stressed in a June 11 letter to the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries' 13 members that if current
over-production was not curbed, ``things may soon get out of
control.''
   Boussena, Algeria's Mines Minister, stressed that the current
price slide stemming from over-production could lead ``to a serious
price collapse akin to the one experienced in 1986, with its full
consequences on member countries' revenues and economic prospects.''
   Oil prices nosedived to below $10 a barrel in 1986, causing
major economic convulsions for OPEC and other major producers.
   The cartel currently is seeking to maintain prices at around $18
a barrel but prices on world markets have fallen to about $15 a
barrel.
   OPEC members agreed in Geneva on May 2 to trim production to
22.1-22.6 million barrels a day from the April daily level of 23.98
million barrels, far in excess of the ceiling agreed in December.
   But overall OPEC production last month was estimated at 23.68
million barrels a day because several members, particularly Kuwait
and the United Arab Emirates, were continuing to produce well above
their quotas.
   The newsletter quoted Boussena as saying that ``the main driving
factor'' behind the recent downturn in prices ``is undoubtedly the
deep-rooted feeling of the market that the agreement reached in
Geneva is not being implemented by OPEC.''
   He said that this ``is fueling the extreme downward pressure on
prices (and) is now substantiated by the publication of the major
secondary sources' figures on OPEC production for May ... thus
highlighting the fact that reduction pledges have not been
effectively implemented, at least to the extent necessary for the
market to build confidence in the agreement.''
   He cautioned that if action was not taken swiftly to reduce
production ``things may soon get out of control with all the
damaging consequences on OPEC cohesion and credibility and our
member countries' ability to continue working together for the
benefit of all.''
   According to the newsletter, Boussena plans to visit all OPEC
members soon to take soundings on the prospect of working out a
durable agreement on production and prices at the July conference.
   The weekly newsletter noted that despite ``considerable
disquiet'' in OPEC about the production violations, there was no
chance of an emergency OPEC meeting before the scheduled July 25
conference in Geneva.
   The survey reported last week that despite the over-production
in May, output was expected to drop considerably in June.

evidence of a weaker-than-expected economy.
   But analysts say investors also have begun to look at a
potentially darker side of the same story _ the prospect of
continued disappointments in corporate earnings.

fallen in each of the last three earnings reporting months _
October 1989, January 1990 and April 1990.''

encouragement from further declines in interest rates.
   Software Toolworks tumbled 3~ to 20 as the most active issue in

   Donald Trump's tentative debt restructuring
arrangement, which is needed to boltser his troubled real estate
and casino empire, is being jeopardized by ongoing disputes among
small and large creditor banks, a report published today said.
   The New York Times said negotiatons fell apart Saturday when the
big lenders argued over the proposed terms of the loan package
reached earlier this month. At the center of the dispute is how
much each bank should contribute and the collateral to be used, the
newspaper said, quoting unidentified sources.
   Trump's financial problems grew more precarious on Friday, after
he missed the payment on an estimated $31 million in interest and
principal on bonds used to finance his Trump's Castle hotel-casino
in Atlantic City.
   Trump was given a 10-day grace period on Friday. If he doesn't
come up with the money before the grace period expires, he could be
in default, and that might place Trump in jeopardy of losing his
New Jersey casino licenses.
   Banking sources familiar with the talks said last week that
Trump's four major bank lenders _ Citibank, Bank Trust New York
Corp., Chase Manhattan and Manufactueres Hanover _ agreed to
provide an additional $60 million in loans and to temporarily
suspend interest payments.
   The sources had said Citicorp and Bankers Trust would provide
about two-thirds of the new loan.
   The big banks have been trying to persuade some of the smaller
creditors, including some Japanese banks, to go along with the
proposed restructuring, but some of those institutions have been
opposed to the plan. First Fidelity Bancorp of Newark, N.J., and
Midlantic Banks Inc. of Edison, N.J., reportedly were the main
holdouts.
   The ongoing negotiations also have raised speculation that
bankers want more authority over operation of Trump's properties.
   The Wall Street Journal reported today that the banks have been
demanding that Trump appoint two top executives _ a chief executive
officer and a chief financial officer _ to control the daily
operations of the Trump Organization. Dan Klores, a spokesman for
Trump, refused to comment on the negotiations or the reports.
   He said the banks resumed talks today after their meeting broke
off on Saturday. Banks also have refused official comment.
   At his 44th birthday celebration at his Taj Mahal Casino Resort
on Saturday, Trump told throngs of employees that he was confident
he would rise above his financial problems.
   ``Over the years, I've surprised a lot of people. The largest
surprise is yet to come,'' he said.
   The purpose behind the proposed debt restructuring plan was to
give Trump time to wait for his assets to rise in value.
   Trump has been beset by a slumping real estate market in New
York, and disappointing results from his three Atlantic City
casinos and the Trump Shuttle airline.
   His real estate holdings, which also include New York's Plaza
Hotel and Trump Tower, were built largely with the funds from bank
loans and borrowed from junk bonds. Trump owes banks an estimated
$2 billion and bondholders another $1 billion.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
pressured by forecasts for good crop weather this week in the
Midwest.
   The predicted mild temperatures and scattered showers are
considered friendly to the new corn and soybean crops. But selling
pressure was limited by reports of weekend flood damage to fields
in central Iowa, central Ilinois and parts of Nebraska.
   ``I've gotten probably 10 calls this morning from all over''
with reports of crop damage caused by severe weather, said William
Biedermann, director of research for the commodities brokerage
Allendale Inc.
   The opening declines extended fairly steep losses registered
last week in the corn and soybean markets.
   The Agriculture Department's weekly report on planting progress
and crop conditions was due out after the close of trading.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent to 2 cents lower
with the contract for delivery in July at $3.27 a bushel; corn was
1{ cents lower to } cent higher with July at $2.81{ a bushel; oats
were unchanged across the board with July at $1.38{ a bushel;
soybeans were unchanged to 5 cents lower with July at $5.84} a

   Cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were lower
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .28 cent higher with June at 76.92
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent lower to .80 cent higher
with August at 85.45 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent to .52
cent lower with June at 60.65 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .25 cent to the limit 2 cents lower with July at 64.45 cents a

   Cattle futures settled mixed on Friday; pork futures were down

   The number of working oil and natural gas rigs in

   Last week, the rig count had risen by eight to total 991. A year

   Baker Hughes' rig count reflects the number of rotary rigs
actively exploring for oil and gas as of last Friday, not the
number of producing wells.
   The Houston-based oil toolmaker has kept track of the rig count
_ the widely watched index of drilling activity _ since 1940.
   At the height of the oil boom in December 1981, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But the rig count plunged to a low of 663
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986.
   Among major oil-producing states, Oklahoma's count was up by
seven, Pennsylvania was up by five, New Mexico by four, Colorado by
three and Louisiana by one.
   Texas sustained the greatest decline, losing 17 rigs. Ohio lost
four and Kansas and Wyoming each lost three.

<HEAD>CBOE, AMEX and Cincinnati Exchange Pursue After-Hours Trading
Network</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three equities markets announced this morning
they have reached a definitive agreement to trade through the night
using a computer network.
   The Chicago Board Options Exchange, the American Stock Exchange
and the Cincinnati Stock Exchange hope to capture some of the
trading conducted abroad when it is nighttime in the United States.
   The computer network would be provided by Reuters Holdings PLC.
   The exchanges expect the system will begin working in two to
three years, providing a market from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., officials
said at news conferences in New York and Chicago.
   The CBOE and AMEX would handle their stock options through the
system and the Cincinnati Stock Exchange would offer U.S.-traded
stocks. The specific number of issues involved in the system has
not been decided, officials said.
   Many of the details of how the system will work have yet to be
determined, officials of the exchanges said at the press
conferences, which were linked via television. The CBOE would build
and operate the main computer for the system and Reuters would
build the network that provides traders access to the markets'
computer.
   Other exchanges, specifically the New York Stock Exchange and
the Tokyo Exchange, have been invited to join the system, officials
said.
   Although the three exchanges will be cooperating in the
electronic system, James R. Jones, chairman and chief executive of
the American Stock Exchange, said there still will be competition.
   ``We will continue to have great competition in the daytime,''
he said. ``I think this will actually increase competition
globally.''
   The group's intention to work toward an automated after-hours
trading system was first announced in March 1989. Officials said
last week's announcement of plans for late-night trading by the
NYSE did not prompt today's announcement, officials said. They
added, however, they were aware the NYSE was considering
after-hours trading.
   By 1991 the NYSE plans to hold three auctions through the night
of each listed stock. Each stock would trade once at each auction
with trades combined at a single price.
   The definitive agreement was reached about a month ago and the
boards of the companies involved finished approving the plan late
last week.

   Stock prices closed sharply lower on London's
Stock Exchange Monday after a poor early showing on Wall Street.
   Market makers, who buy and sell stocks continuously at posted
prices, marked down shares early in the London session to try to
generate some investor interest, with little success.
   Later in the session, London stocks were pressured by a drop on
Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 22.77 points
to 2,913.12 at late afternoon in London.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was down 21.8 points, or 0.9 percent, at 2,370.5, slightly better
than the session minimum of 2,367.4. The high for the index was
2,394.5.
   The Financial Times 30-share index finished 14 points lower at
1,911.9. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 9.53 points to
close at 1,285.83.
   Volume came to 403.4 million shares, little changed from
Friday's 400.2 million shares.

   Most American workers ``will see their dreams
slip away'' unless society invests far more in improving their
skills in school and on the job, a commission led by two former
labor secretaries warned today.
   The United States also will lose the economic race with other
countries unless business, schools and government take radical
steps to boost worker skills, concluded the report.
   ``Most workers receive no education or training beyond high
school,'' the report said, adding that existing state and federal
training programs are ``haphazard, incoherent and bureaucratic.''
   ``What we are facing is an economic cliff of sorts. And the
front line working people of America are about to fall off it,''
the report said.
   Front-line workers include clerks, secretaries, machinists,
drivers, farm hands and others who are not usually college educated.
   The report offered a blueprint for changing the way schools,
business and government prepare workers for an increasingly complex
economy.
   Among its recommendations: a requirement that U.S. companies
devote at least 1 percent of payroll to skills training and a
mandate that no one under 18 be allowed to hold a job until earning
a certificate proving mastery of basic academic skills and work
qualities.
   It also recommended that states, with federal assistance, create
``local youth centers'' for ensuring that all dropouts ages 14-21
earn mastery certificates. The report estimated such centers would
cost $8.2 billion a year.
   Teacher union leaders praised the commission's findings at a
news conference today. American Federation of Teachers president
Albert Shanker called the report ``the most significant in the
whole reform movement in terms of substance.''
   Commission member John Sculley, chairman of Apple Computer,
Inc., added his support and told reporters, ``I believe America
today is faced with a workforce crisis.''
   The report warned that many with limited skills face the loss of
jobs as U.S. businesses struggle to cut labor costs to stay
competitive with foreign companies.
   ``Higher skills means the jobs stay at home,'' the report said.
   Seventy percent of U.S. workers ``will see their dreams slip
away'' unless society increases the commitment to improved skills,
the report said.
   The study was produced by the 34-member Commission on the Skills
of the American Work Force. The panel included top business,
education and labor executives. Its chairmen were former U.S. Labor
Secretaries Bill Brock and Ray Marshall and Ira Magaziner, an
international business authority.
   The report was based on about 2,000 interviews conducted at over
550 companies and agencies since last July in the United States,
Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland, Japan and Singapore.
   While U.S. businesses spend some $30 billion training workers,
only one-third is spent on non-college educated employees. About
15,000 companies, less than 1 percent of the total, provide over 90
percent of corporate-based training in the U.S., the study said.
   By contrast, the report found foreign education systems far more
committed than U.S. schools to preparing all students for
successful careers, not just the college-bound.
   And the approximately 100 foreign corporations in the study were
generally more inclined to avoid layoffs and provide worker
training than U.S. companies.
   The study was funded with $500,000 in grants from the Carnegie
Corporation of New York, New York state and Towers Perrin, a New
York-based consulting firm.
   The commission was created by the National Center on Education
and the Economy, a Rochester, N.Y.-based group whose president,
Marc Tucker, was another principal author.
   The report's central theme was that U.S. schools and businesses
should strive to ``professionalize'' front-line workers and bolster
skills so they will need less supervision. In turn, companies will
become more efficient, sell more, expand and employ more people at
higher wages.
   In an interview last week, Magaziner expressed optimism that the
recommendations would be realized, especially when Americans
realize that other industrial nations have already adopted many of
the steps.
   ``I think Americans are ultimately very pragmatic once they
realize a problem exists. We operate on fads. When an idea gets
momentum, I think we move pretty quickly,'' he said.

<HEAD>The Chairman's Anti-Inflation Campaign Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixteen years ago the chairman tried to tame
inflation once and for all with a whip. As a member of President
Ford's administration, he helped launch a campaign to Whip
Inflation Now.
   Now, critics say, he is using the same rope in another way: to
tie up the economy.
   To a very limited extent in the 1970s, it might be claimed, the
chairman succeeded. Whereas consumer prices had risen 11 percent in
1974, the increase had dropped to as low as 5.8 percent in 1976.
   Not everyone then was willing to credit the chairman with having
succeeded because the campaign was atrociously planned. It was
launched as the economy was plunging into a recession that would
relieve pressure on prices.
   And critics today are wondering again if something of the sort
might be occurring. Once again the enemy is inflation, or the
threat of it; the goal is to destroy it; and the risk is a descent
into recession.
   As before, the chairman is the same. In 1974, Alan Greenspan was
chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. In 1990,
he is chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, which seeks to control
the money supply.
   Greenspan has a firm, almost unrelenting grip on it, and perhaps
as a direct result _ you can't buy and spend if you haven't got
access to funds _ there is growing evidence of an economy
progressively weakening.
   Consumer demand has shrunk. Real estate sales and building have
almost stopped in some areas. Small businesses, especially those
related in any way to real estate, have trouble borrowing.
Corporate profits are on the skids.
   The evidence shows up all over. Plans for investment in new
plants and equipment have ceased to grow. And private-sector
employment shows signs of shriveling, even when temporary Census
Bureau jobs are included.
   Money is the raw material that powers economic activity, and
when the Fed tightens the spigot, the wheels of commerce slows.
Keep the spigot closed long enough and some of the wheels stop.
Eventually, recession threatens.
   Some economists think that recession is closing in, and that
statistics released over the next month might even show it. But
there seems to be no letup in the chairman's resolve to lick this
monster called inflation.
   Whether he has the right notion or is destined to badly damage
the economy is up for debate. Greenspan has his supporters, even
among business people, who say the nation can never embark on a
real expansion until the job is done.
   That job, of course, is to bury inflation so deeply it cannot
arise again for years.
   The chairman's first effort failed after a few years. After
dropping to 5.8 percent in 1976, the consumer price index reached
double digits in 1979 and helped bring on the deep recession of
1981 and 1982.
   Recovery followed, helped a great deal by a loosening of the
money spigot. As most people know, because they benefited from it,
the economy began a long expansion right through 1989, an expansion
that might be about to end.
   Beginning late in the 1980s, the Fed once again began closing
the spigot, not abruptly or completely, but enough to reduce the
growth of bank reserves _ which govern lending _ and then to bring
about an actual contraction.
   Now the signs of a economy on the edge are showing up
everywhere, and from everywhere the cries for easier money will be
heard. Not just from business either, but from elected officials
who fear for their jobs.
   Greenspan's supporters, and probably the chairman himself, seem
to think, however, that slow growth or even a recession might be
the price to pay to bury inflation for years to come.

<HEAD>Sen. Bentsen Urges Bush to Include Carla Hills in Summit
Delegation. Also moving on general news wires.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, who
would like to be included in the U.S. delegation to next month's
economic summit, got support Monday from an influential Democratic
senator.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, urged President Bush to reconsider his decision
excluding Hills from the summit of the world's seven largest
industrial countries scheduled for July 9-11 in Houston.
   Traditionally, the only members of the president's Cabinet who
attend the annual economic summits are the secretary of state and
the treasury secretary. But Hills has made no secret of the fact
that she would like to make an exception to that rule this year.
   Bentsen said Hills' presence was especially important this year
because of the many unresolved issues in the current Uruguay Round
of global free trade talks, being held under the auspices of the
96-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   ``Most of the issues of greatest importance to the United States
_ investment, intellectual property, services trade _ have not been
resolved,'' Bentsen wrote in a letter to Bush.
   ``Given Ambassador Hills' critical role in the negotiations, I
believe that she should be part of the team that accompanies you to
the summit,'' Bentsen said.
   Hills has said she hopes Bush and the leaders of Japan, West
Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada will use the summit to
search for common ground to break the stalemate in the trade talks.
   The summit will come only a few weeks before a critical
negotiating session in Geneva.
   The Bush administration has made achieving a new agreement its
top trade priority this year. However, it has been unable to
overcome resistance to a key plank in the U.S. proposal that would
eliminate expensive trade-distorting farm subsidies over the next
decade.
   Torie Clarke, Hills' press secretary, said that Hills
``certainly appreciated Chairman Bentsen's input, but now if she
does get invited, it won't be because of her own charm and
persuasiveness.''

   Stock prices fell sharply today in light but
steady selling ascribed to worries about the outlook for corporate
profits.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which edged up to a
record high in a mixed session Friday, tumbled 43.56 to 2,892.33 by
2 p.m. Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 3 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 335 up,
1,167 down and 436 unchanged.
   Stocks have climbed to new peaks this spring as interest rates
have fallen and inflation worries have subsided on pervasive
evidence of a weaker-than-expected economy.
   But analysts say investors also have begun to look at a
potentially darker side of the same story _ the prospect of
continued disappointments in corporate earnings.
   The first earnings reports for the second quarter are due out in
little more than two weeks. As Edward Kerschner at PaineWebber Inc.
observes in a current market commentary, ``the stock market has
fallen in each of the last three earnings reporting months _
October 1989, January 1990 and April 1990.''
   To break that pattern in July, he suggests, investors may need
encouragement from further declines in interest rates.
   Losers among the blue chips included Boeing, down 1&lsqb; at 59;
International Business Machines, down 1&rsqb; at 119; Philip Morris,
down 1 at 43, and American Express, down | at 30{.
   Software Toolworks tumbled 4~ to 19 as the most active issue in
the over-the-counter market. A Barron's magazine article raised
questions about the hopes behind the stock's steep rise since last
year.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 2.38 to 195.48. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 2.88 at 361.15.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 90.37 million shares with two
hours to go.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   PENSIONS
   
   The court spared the federal program protecting the pensions of
30 million American workers from a potential financial crisis.
   By an 8-1 vote, the court broadened the authority of the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation to order employers to restore
terminated pension plans.
   The case is PBGC vs. LTV, 89-390.
   
   PATENTS
   
   The court ruled that a federal law reducing patent infringement
protection for drug companies applies to medical devices.
   The court, by a 6-2 vote, refused to reinstate a $26.7 million
award against Medtronic Inc. of Minneapolis. Eli Lilly and Co. of
Indianapolis said Medtronic infringed patents on a device implanted
in patients to correct potentially fatal heart rhythms.
   The case is Eli Lilly vs. Medtronic Inc., 89-243.
   
   S&amp;L
   
   The court agreed to consider killing a lawsuit by a Texas
businessman who says federal regulators caused the financial ruin
of his failed savings and loan association.
   The court said it will review a ruling that revived part of
Thomas M. Gaubert's negligence suit against the government. The
suit alleges the federal regulators who assumed day-to-day
operation of the Irving-based Independent American Savings
Association ran it right out of business.
   The case is U.S. vs. Gaubert, 89-1793.
   
   HANK WILLIAMS
   
   The court refused to kill a lawsuit in which a woman who claims
to be Hank Williams Sr.'s daughter seeks some of the late country
music legend's copyright royalties.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court
ruling that Cathy Yvonne Stone, 37, is entitled to have her legal
fight put before a jury.
   The cases are Williams vs. Stone, 89-1538 and 89-1563.
   
   TENURE
   
   The court left intact a decision forcing Boston University to
grant a lifetime professor's job to a woman found to have been a
victim of sex bias.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that requiring
the university to grant her tenure interferes with its academic
freedom.
   A key issue in the case of English literature professor Julia
Prewitt Brown was the admissibility of trial evidence allegedly
showing university President John Silber harbored sexist attitudes.
   The case is Boston University vs. Brown, 89-1680.
   
   SECURITIES
   
   The court let the Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulate
a new form of financial trading called index participations.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that gives the
CFTC, rather than the Securities and Exchange Commission, such
regulatory power.
   Index participations are contracts of indefinite duration based
on the value of a group of securities.
   The cases are Investment Company Institute vs. SEC, 89-1484;
American Stock Exchange vs. Chicago Mercantile Exchange, 89-1502;
Philadelphia Stock Exchange vs. Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
89-1503.
   
   ANTITRUST
   
   The court said it will use the case of an eye surgeon denied
staff privileges at a Los Angeles hospital to study the scope of a
key federal antitrust law.
   The justices agreed to hear an appeal by the hospital seeking to
dismiss the doctor's antitrust suit. A ruling is not expected until
next year.
   The case is Summith Health Ltd. vs. Pinhas, 89-1679.

<HEAD>Sears to Open 198 Brand Central Stores This Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. this week will open 198 of
its in-store, brand-name electronics and home appliance outlets in
16 states and Puerto Rico, the country's largest retailer said
Monday.
   The introduction of more than 840 Brand Central outlets, which
will be completed with the new additions this week, is the first
step in Sears' strategy to become a ``store of superstores''
featuring brand name and private-label merchandise, said Michael
Bozic, chairman and chief executive office of Sears Merchandising
Group.
   The next phases will focus on the furniture, children's, men's
and women's clothing, home and yard, and auto departments.
   Sears will open 37 brand-name furniture outlets this year, some
in Sears stores and others free-standing. It will revise 300 auto
centers, adding brand-name merchandise, and also open 50 brand-name
outlets each in the apparel and home and yard departments, Bozic
said.
   Chicago-based Sears is in the third year of overhauling its
merchandising unit to better compete with discount and specialty
retailers. The plan announced in March 1988 also includes
consolidation of management functions, an ``everday low price''
retail strategy, relocation of the merchandise group's headquarters
to the suburbs and refinancing of the downtown Sears Tower, the

   Grain and soybean futures prices rallied Monday
on the Chicago Board of Trade, ending a three-day decline amid
short covering prompted in part by concerns about flood damage to
corn and soybean crops.
   Analysts said most of the buying reflected profit-taking by
traders who sold futures contracts last week, establishing short
positions, and were now buying back contracts at lower prices.
   Further buying was prompted by reports that heavy weekend rains
damaged newly planted corn and soybeans in low-lying areas of
central Iowa, central Illinois and southern Ohio.
   Wheat futures were supported by reports that China was bidding
for 500,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices under a
previously announced Agriculture Department offer.
   Wheat futures settled 2{ cents lower to 2 cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.30 a bushel; corn was 3{ cents

<HEAD>High Court to Review Rulings on Union Election Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court agreed Monday to resolve
conflicting rulings over unions' legal duty to cooperate with
candidates for union office who want to distribute campaign
literature.
   The justices said they will decide whether a maritime industry
union violated federal labor law when in 1988 it refused to give a
membership mailing list to a candidate for the union's presidency.
   Labor law gives candidates for union office a right to have
campaign literature distributed by the union. The court must decide
whether that right is conditioned by the reasonableness of the
request for distribution, or the reasonableness of a union rule
restricting such requests.
   A decision is expected sometime next year.
   The appeal acted on today was filed by the International
Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots, a 7,500 national union
representing ship officers, pilots and other merchant marine
workers.
   The union, based in Baltimore, holds elections every four years.
Prior to the nominating convention for the 1988 election,
presidential candidate Timothy A. Brown, a ship captain from Tampa,
Fla., asked the union for mailing labels containing the names and
addresses of all voting union members.
   Brown wished to distribute literature at his own expense before
the nominating convention.
   He said he sought to attract support from other members before
they were likely to have committed their votes to other candidates.
   The early mailing also would help offset the advantage held by
incumbent union officers who might seek re-election.
   Elwood Kyser, a union officer, turned down Brown's request
because the union's constitution does not authorize distribution of
campaign literature until after a nominating convention.
   Brown sued, and a federal judge in Baltimore ordered the union
to furnish the mailing labels so that Brown's campaign literature
could be distributed.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the order last Nov.
17 by an 8-2 vote.
   ``We believe the test to be not whether the union's rule was
reasonable but whether the candidate's request was reasonable,''
the apeals court said.
   Another federal appeals court ruled otherwise.
   Asked for their views, Bush administration lawyers said the 4th
Circuit court's ruling is correct but urged the high court to use
the case to resolve the conflicting decisions.
   The case is International Organization of Masters, Mates &amp;
Pilots vs. Brown, 89-1330.

<HEAD>Top Bank Regulator Tries To Reassure Northeast Bankers, Consumers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROSS SNEYD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's chief federal bank
regulator, watching credit across the Northeast dry up amid rising
loan losses, tried to reassure jittery bankers and their customers
Monday that the industry is sound.
   Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke told a group of
Providence executives that the federal government has not toughened
its regulations or its audits of banks. What it has done, he said,
is reacted to changes in the economy and in the process has
uncovered bad loans at many institutions.
   ``We're trying to make sure you have a safe and sound banking
system, and at the same time not choke off the availability of
credit,'' he said.
   Clarke conceded that a wave of examination of real
estate-related bank credit have made it tougher get a loan.
Although examiners ordered many of the Northeast's largest banks to
increase their reserves to cover potentially bad loans, regulators
did not advise against continuing to lend money, he said.
   ``I'm concerned about the misconceptions and misperceptions
about what bank supervisors and the (Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency) are doing,'' he said. ``There is no doubt confusion
in the minds of bankers about what we're doing.''
   The comptroller is focusing much of his attention on New
England, where some business leaders say a regional economic
slowdown is being compounded by their inability to get loans.
   Small businesses especially feel they are the victims of
stricter bank lending policies, said James Hagan, president of the
Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce.
   ``They are experiencing a great deal (more) of difficulty in
gaining access to capital than they were a year or two ago,'' Hagan
said.
   Walter McLaughlin, president of McLaughlin Automotive Stores in
Providence, said although he had repaid his loans more quickly than
required he was being hurt by the credit crunch.
   ``Now they want to charge me more money,'' he said.
   McLaughlin said he was especially perturbed because he
anticipated the economic slowdown and cut back more than two years
ago.
   ``Why wasn't the OCC advising bankers to do the same thing?'' he
asked Clarke. ``If a little guy like me saw it coming, why didn't
you?''
   Clarke said regulators also saw that the economy _ especially in
the robust Northeast _ could not sustain the strong growth of the
mid-1980s.
   ``If anyone suggests that the OCC has just gotten religion ...
that's just plain wrong,'' he said. ``We've been on this problem
since 1987.''
   Nevertheless, politicians are demanding election-year
explanations for the regulators' tough examinations.
   Rep. Claudine Schneider, R-R.I., asked the General Accounting
Office on Monday to investigate whether federal regulators
deliberately are trying to stifle lending.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., whom Ms. Schneider is challenging
in the fall election, told a meeting of the Rhode Island Bankers
Association on Monday that Clarke ``needs to be made more aware of
what is happening in Rhode Island and the rest of New England ...
.''
   Clarke said he was familiar with the situation but said lending
changes likely were just a reflection of the slowing economy.
   ``There is understandably a constriction in the amount of credit
and there understandably is a tightening of the terms and
conditions on that credit,'' he said. But in the long run, he
added, that should be good because in many cases, those terms and
conditions ``were pretty loose.''

   Some models of a device designed to warn
parents that an infant has stopped breathing may not work, the Food
and Drug Administration said Monday.
   The device, also used to monitor adults who suffer apnea, is
manufactured by Electronic Monitors Inc. of Euless, Texas, the FDA
said. Those who suffer from apnea temporarily stop breathing during
sleep.
   The models involved are RE-134B and Mon-A-Therm Respirate, for
those older than 4 years old, and Models RE-134C and RE-134D for
infants.
   ``Some models may fail to signal an alarm,'' the FDA said in
issuing a first-class alert, its most serious health warning. The
problem, the agency said, is with a defective time delay switch.
   FDA said the company was recalling the 1,583 monitors it
distributed. Sixty percent went to hospitals and the rest were sent
to home health care agencies that rent or distribute them to the
public.
   The FDA said it did not know how many monitors were still being
used by consumers.

   Code-Alarm Inc. on Monday
announced a new stolen-vehicle locator system to compete against a
system made by LoJack Corp.
   Code-Alarm's system, called Intercept, works with traditional
anti-theft equipment, such as an audible alarm and an ignition
cutoff switch. If a thief gets around the primary system, a
cellular phone transmits the map coordinates of a stolen car.
   The system will retail for $1,495 including a cellular phone,
with a monthly monitoring fee of $19.95. Without the phone, the
system would cost $995.
   ``Unlike other trackers, Intercept does not need to have
additional devices put in police cars,'' said Code-Alarm
spokeswoman Suzanne Berschback, who said the product would be test
marketed in Detroit before being introduced in other cities with
high rates of auto theft.
   A company monitoring station tracks vehicles, and employees
relay information to law enforcement agencies by telephone. A
remote engine shutoff system can be used to disable a stolen car.
   LoJack, marketed by the Needham, Mass., company, costs $595 to
install and uses devices in police cruisers to locate a stolen car.

<HEAD>Foreign Ministers Agree South African Sanctions Could Be Gradually
Eased</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign ministers of the European Community
agreed Monday some economic sanctions against South Africa could be
lifted before the government abolishes entirely its racial policy
of apartheid.
   But the ministers of the 12-nation trading bloc did not announce
the immediate easing of any bans imposed against the white-led
government.
   ``There was not a majority in favor of the lifting of the
sanctions,'' said Irish Foreign Minister Gerry Collins, whose
government has opposed any change in the measures. Ireland
currently holds the rotating presidency of the trading bloc.
   But he said the ministers did agree ``that something very
important is happening in South Africa.''
   In an effort to pressure the government to end its policy of
racial segregation, the community decided in 1986 to halt imports
of South African iron, steel and gold coins and to ban new
investment in that country. It had previously prohibited the sales
of military equipment.
   Britain has been pressing the community to ease the sanctions
because of recent reform measures by South African President F.W.
de Klerk. In February, Britain unilaterally lifted the ban on new
investment.
   Black leader Nelson Mandela has urged the community to continue
pressuring de Klerk's government.
   Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, said all the
community nations now have backed a step-by-step strategy under
which the sanctions could be lifted gradually as progress was made
on scrapping apartheid.
   He said the community's view was: ``You do not have to wait for
apartheid to end before you begin to relax the pressures on the
South African government.''
   ``No one argued that the sanctions should remain until the
complete dismantlement of apartheid,'' agreed a Dutch source, who
demanded anonymity.
   But Hurd said there was no consensus on when the first step
should be taken.
   Sources say only Ireland and Denmark have argued against any
change in the sanctions.
   Hurd said some countries want to send a signal of encouragement
to de Klerk, perhaps by lifting one of the bans next month.
   He said the ``logical first step'' would be to relax the
prohibition on new investment in South Africa.
   But he said other countries ``were not so clear about that and
were not really ready to go that far.''
   ``There is a spectrum of opinion on that subject,'' he said.
   Collins noted that de Klerk had lifted the government's state of
emergency in three of South Africa's four provinces. The decree had
been in effect for four years.
   He said not all the country's political prisoners have been
freed from prison, ``although the prospects seem to be good that
they will be.''
   The leaders of the trading bloc nations will discuss the issue
when they gather next week in Dublin for their summer summit.
   Community members are Belgium, Britain, West Germany, Ireland,
France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, Spain, Portugal,
Italy and Greece.

<HEAD>Court Lets CFTC Regulate New Form of Financial Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday allowed the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission to regulate a type of stock
market investment called an index participation.
   The court, without comment, left intact an appeals court ruling
that gives the CFTC, rather than the Securities and Exchange
Commission, such regulatory power.
   An index participation is a contract of indefinite duration
based on the value of a group of securities. The contract resembles
a basket of stocks because its value is tied to a broad
stock-market index, such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index.
   The appeals court held that such products come under the CFTC's
supervision if they have any element of a futures contract.
   The SEC generally regulates securities, and the CFTC has
jurisdiction over futures contracts.
   The Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said last
year an index participation has elements of both a security and a
futures contract. But the appeals court said the CFTC has exclusive
jurisdiction over the investment instrument.
   The appeals court ruling was challenged by the American Stock
Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange and the Options Clearing Corp. The American and The
latter organization issues options that are traded on the exchanges.
   The president of the Philadelphia exchange, Nicholas A.
Giordano, called the Supreme Court action ``a major step backward
in the regulation and development of innovative new products.''
   ``The real loser here is the individual investor for whom index
participations were originally designed,'' he said in a statement.
``Lost in the debate over legislative authority on these products
was the elemental fact that far fewer brokers are qualified to
trade futures than are to trade securities.''
   Bob Shabazian, a spokesman for the American Stock Exchange, said
the Amex had no comment on the court's action, but added that the
exchange supported a bill before Congress that would shift
regulation of all stock index futures from the CFTC to the SEC.
   The Bush administration, which had urged the Supreme Court not
to disturb the 7th Circuit court ruling, also supports the bill.
But the proposal has received a cool reception on Capitol Hill,
where some critics say the proposal could hinder passage of other
measures designed to give the SEC more power to curb Wall Street
volatility.
   The plan to reduce the CFTC's power was prompted by rulings by
the 7th Circuit and other courts that give the CFTC exclusive
regulatory authority over any financial product with even the
slightest aspect of a futures contract.
   SEC and Treasury Department officials have complained those
rulings have led to long legal battles over jurisdiction while
innovative financial products are being developed or copied in
overseas markets.
   Index participations, for example, are available only on the
Toronto Stock Exchange and not on any U.S. exchange.
   The cases are Investment Company Institute vs. SEC, 89-1484;
American Stock Exchange vs. Chicago Mercantile Exchange, 89-1502;
Philadelphia Stock Exchange vs. Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
89-1503.

   The stock market suffered its sharpest setback
in almost five months Monday, beset by worries about the outlook
for corporate profits.
   Prices came under pressure from light but steady selling
throughout the session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had closed out
last week at a record high, fell 53.71 to 2,882.18, for its largest
loss since it dropped 77.45 points on Jan. 22.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
353 up, 1,230 down and 428 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 133.47 million
shares, down from 205.13 million Friday, when activity was swollen
by a ``triple witching hour'' involving expiring options and
futures on stocks and stock indexes.
   Stocks climbed to new peaks this spring as interest rates fell

<HEAD>Non-Contract UAL Employees Meet With Greenwald</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Representatives of UAL Corp.'s non-union
employees met Monday with the chief of the union group trying to
buy the airline company in hopes of avoiding a setback in the
buyout effort.
   The meeting in Chicago between Gerald Greenwald and leaders of
the non-contract group was their second within a week, said Stephen
Fraidin, a lawyer for the non-union workers.
   It followed a stinging statement Sunday by the 26,000
non-contract workers expressing disappointment that the union group
had not accepted proposed wage concessions and benefit
modifications under which the non-contract workers could support
the buyout plan.
   The unions do not consider the non-union group's support
essential to the proposed $4.54 billion deal for the parent of
United Airlines. But opposition by the non-contract group, which
accounts for more than one-third of UAL's 71,500 employees, could
complicate the unions' attempts to raise financing.
   The buyout group's contract to buy UAL will lapse if financing
is not obtained by Aug. 10. If financing is secured, the group
would have until the end of the year to close the deal.
   ``We continue to be hopeful that an agreement can be reached,''
Fraidin said in a telephone interview.
   Greenwald, formerly vice chairman of Chrysler Corp., agreed
earlier this month to head the buyout group composed of United's
pilots, flight attendants and Machinists unions.
   If they are successful, Greenwald would become chairman and
chief executive of UAL, which is based near Chicago in Elk Grove
Village.
   The non-contract employees said in a news release Sunday they
had developed a package of wage concessions, benefit modifications
and governance agreements during discussions with the United
Employee Acquisition Corp. _ the entity formed by the unions to
handle the proposed buyout.
   But the acquisition firm has not agreed to the package, a news
release from System Roundtable said.
   System Roundtable is an organization of representatives from the
different groups of non-contract employees. It effectively has
become the non-contract employees' bargaining agent in the buyout
plan.
   ``If this package is not agreed to very shortly by UEAC, it does
not bode well for UEAC's ability to make the business judgments
that it will certainly face in trying to finance the proposed
leveraged buyout, and, if that transaction is completed, in running
the airline,'' the release said.
   Among other things, the non-contract workers are looking for
improved pensions and assurance that the agreement with the unions
would be binding and not subject to change by a new UAL managment.
   The non-contract group includes reservations and ticket agents,
professional and technical staffers, and management and supervisors
excluding Chairman Stephen Wolf and other top officers.

servicing portfolio that will triple the size of NCNB Mortgage
Corp., making it one of the 15 largest mortgage companies in the
country, company officials announced Monday.
   The expanded portfolio and the accompanying loan servicing

<TEXT>
   An agreement among several major banks to loan
$60 million to developer Donald Trump was in limbo Monday as the
institutions, once close to a deal, continued haggling over its
terms.
   The deal, aimed at helping the developer continue making
payments to bankers while his $3 billion in bank and bond debts are
restructured, was nearing completion late last week.
   But over the weekend, the deal fell into disarray as several
banks jockeyed for a better position and no agreement could be
reached.
   Meanwhile, the clock ticked away on the grace period for a
roughly $43 million junk bond payment Trump missed on Friday. The
payment was due on bonds used to finance the purchase of Trump's
Castle, one of the developer's three Atlantic City hotel-casinos.
   Trump also did not make a $30 million payment due Manufacturers
Hanover Corp.
   A Trump spokesman, Dan Klores, said talks among the banks and
the Trump Organization continued Monday, but he refused to comment
further and would not say whether the parties were close to a new
agreement.
   Klores also refused to discuss any plans by Trump to make the
missed payment.
   Spokesmen for the major banks _ Citicorp, Manufacturers Hanover,
Chase Manhattan Corp. and Bankers Trust Co. _ either refused to
comment on the talks or did not return a reporter's repeated phone
calls Monday.
   But investors, who have bid down the price of the Trump casino
bonds on the news about his financial problems, did not appear
unnerved by the latest development.
   Traders reported the bonds were little changed in extremely
light volume Monday. The Trump Castle bonds were trading at about
$56 per $100 face amount, down about $2 from Friday, in late
afternoon transactions.
   The debt restructuring plan was aimed at helping Trump to keep
making his debt payments while waiting for his assets to rise in
value so some eventually could be sold.
   Trump's assets, which include hotels and office and apartment
buildings in New York, have fallen in value due to the slumping
real estate and casino markets. The casinos have been affected by
the slowing Atlantic City resort market.
   The developer also owns the Trump shuttle, the Northeastern air
service bought last year from Eastern Airlines.
   The New York Times, quoting unnamed sources, said negotiations
fell apart over the weekend when the big lenders argued over the
proposed terms of the loan package reached earlier this month. At
the center of the dispute is how much each bank should contribute
and the collateral to be used, the newspaper said.
   Banking sources familiar with the talks said last week the four
major banks agreed to provide an additional $60 million in loans
and to temporarily suspend interest payments.
   The sources had said Citicorp and Bankers Trust would provide
about two-thirds of the new loan.
   The negotiations also have raised speculation that bankers want
more authority over operation of Trump's properties.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that the banks have been
demanding Trump appoint two top executives _ a chief executive
officer and a chief financial officer _ to control the daily
operations of the Trump Organization. Although the payment missed
on the Trump Castle bonds placed the developer in technical
default, he had a 10-day grace period that started Friday during
which he can still come up with the money.
   If Trump is unable to make the payment, bondholders could claim
the property or Trump Castle could be forced into bankruptcy, said
Michael Mulvaney, an analyst with Moody's Investors Service.
However, he said, it was more likely that further negotiations
would be held before the situation became that extreme.
   If Trump went into full default, he could run afoul of New
Jersey gaming regulators and could lose his licenses to operate the
casinos, which also include Trump Plaza and the Taj Mahal.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Rally, Ending Three-Day Slide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures rallied Monday on the Chicago Board of
Trade, ending a three-day slide amid buying prompted in part by
concerns about flood damage to corn and soybean crops.
   On other commodity markets, oil futures fell steeply; pork
bellies extended their recent sharp losses while livestock futures
were mixed; orange juice futures plunged again; copper futures
rose; and precious metals were mixed.
   Wheat futures settled 2{ cents lower to 2 cents higher in
Chicago with the contract for delivery in July at $3.30 a bushel;
corn was 3{ cents to 6\ cents higher with July at $2.86{ a bushel;
oats were 2} cents to 3} cents higher with July at $1.42\ a bushel;
soybeans were 2 cents to 11} cents higher with July at $5.96 a
bushel.
   Most of the buying in the corn and soybean markets represented
profit-taking by traders who sold contracts last week, establishing
``short positions,'' and bought them back Monday at lower prices,
analysts said.
   Further buying after the mostly lower opening was prompted by
reports that heavy weekend rains damaged newly planted corn and
soybeans in low-lying areas of central Iowa, central Illinois and
southern Ohio.
   Wheat futures were supported by reports that China was bidding
for 500,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices under a
previously announced Agriculture Department offer.
   But Gerald Zusel, manager of floor operations at the exchange
for Balfour Maclaine Corp., dismissed the prospective sale of wheat
to China as ``expected business, no big deal.''
   After the close, the Agriculture Department released its weekly
crop-condition reports.
   The USDA said corn planting was 97 percent complete as of Sunday
compared with the five-year average of 99 percent for that date.
   Soybean planting was 79 percent finished compared with the
average of 88 percent.
   The USDA said 18 percent of the winter wheat crop was harvested
as of Sunday, compared with the average of 20 percent. The USDA
rated 78 percent of the crop fair to good with 15 percent rated in
excellent condition.
   Crude oil futures dropped below $16 a barrel for the first time
since December 1988 on the New York Mercantile Exchange after OPEC
President Sadek Boussena warned the cartel that oil prices will
collapse if the organization's members do not adhere to their
self-imposed production limits.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 25 cents to 68 cents
lower with July at $15.94 a barrel; heating oil was .63 cent lower
to .11 cent higher with July at 47.86 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .75 cent lower to .15 cent higher with July at 61.56
cents a gallon.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, pork-belly futures for
near-term delivery tumbled the permitted daily limit of 2 cents a
pound for the third straight day.
   Hog futures settled mixed after falling sharply in the two
previous sessions; cattle futures advanced.
   The recent drop in pork futures reflects a pronounced decline in
demand for pork products among retailers, whose pork profit margins
were eroded by last month's near-record-high hog prices, said
Charles Levitt, senior livestock analyst with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc.
   Cattle futures rose amid expectations that Tuesday's monthly
cattle-on-feed report will show light placements and aggressive
marketings of cattle onto feedlots during May, Levitt said.
   Live cattle futures settled .12 cent to .48 cent higher with
June at 76.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent to .72
cent higher with August at 85.37 cents a pound; hogs were .47 cent
lower to .25 cent higher with June at 61.27 cents a pound; frozen
pork beelies were 2 cents lower to .65 cent higher with July at
64.45 cents a pound.
   Orange juice futures plummeted for the second consecutive day on
the New York Cotton Exchange with all contracts except nearby July
down the 5-cent daily limit.
   Analysts said the market was adjusting to Friday's plunge of
more than 10 cents a pound in the limitless July contract, which
collapsed amid unconfirmed rumors of price cuts by Brazilian
orange-juice producers.
   Orange juice settled 3.2 cents to 5 cents lower with July at
$1.763 a pound.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures settled 20 cents
to 30 cents lower with June at $349.30 a troy ounce; silver was 1.2
cents to 2 cents higher with June at $4.825 a troy ounce.

   For just $5 million, you can have the new
business building at the University of Iowa named after you.
   ``Nobody's been asked to give that much,'' said George Daly,
dean of the College of Business Administration. ``But somebody will
be.''
   For $1 million, companies or individuals could put their names
on the computer lab or a 400-seat auditorium. For $25,000, the
names could go on a study alcove.
   The Iowa Legislature has approved $25 million for the building,
but Daly is looking to raise $8 million to $10 million over the
next three years to ensure the college gets the $34 million
building it wants.
   He's also seeking gifts to buy computers, carpet and furniture
to go in it. Daly doesn't look at it as selling parts of the
building.
   ``I would say we're asking people to invest in management
education at the University of Iowa, to invest in our destiny if
you will,'' Daly said.
   Sales have been brisk for some rooms.
   ``If you want to support an executive MBA classroom,'' Daly
said, ``I'm sorry, but you're too late.''

<HEAD>Colorado Senator Promoted Silvarado Chairman for Federal Job</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., wrote letters of
support for the former chairman of the failed Silverado thrift when
the banking executive sought a federal position, according to
copies of the documents.
   In a letter dated Aug. 9, 1984, Wirth called Michael R. Wise
``extremely able,'' and said he would be ``an excellent
appointment'' to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Advisory
Council.
   At the time, Wise was chairman of the Silverado Banking, Savings
and Loan Association of Denver. Wirth was then a House member from
Colorado, but he was not a member of the House Banking Committee.
   In 1985, Wise gave Wirth a $750 campaign contribution for a
Senate race he won the next year, according to the Federal Election
Commission. Wise also gave to Republicans in 1985-1986, including a
total of $1,000 to Wirth's 1986 opponent, Ken Kramer.
   The House Banking Committee is scheduled to hear testimony from
Wise Tuesday at its third session investigating Silverado. The
collapse of the thrift in December 1988 is expected to cost
taxpayers $1 billion.
   The committee staff said one theme of the hearing will be why
regulators didn't act to clean up the thrift until December 1988
even though there were serious problems at the institution in early
1986. Neil Bush, President Bush's son, served three years on the
Silverado board of directors.
   Wirth, who is a member of the Senate Banking Committee, played
down the significance of the letter and blamed its release on
political backbiting.
   He said in a statement that the letter was ``one of hundreds of
letters that I write each year on behalf of my constituents.''
   Wirth added: ``This is the second time in recent months that
documents have been leaked to the press with the obvious intent of
causing political embarrassment to me.''
   Wirth recently co-sponsored legislation to create a separate
Justice Department division charged with investigating and
prosecuting illegal activity in the savings and loan industry.
   ``We must send a strong message to those in the financial
services industry who violate the law that their actions will be
punished,'' he said last week.
   Both letters Wirth wrote in support of Wise were addressed to
Paul Volcker, then chairman of the Board of Directors of the
Federal Reserve Board. The letters were obtained by The Associated
Press by sources in the House.
   In one letter, Wirth said Wise was ``not only qualified but his
experience with the thrift industry and housing will add valuable
perspective to the council's deliberations on consumer and
community affairs.''
   The other letter was hand-written by Wirth to Volcker. ``He is
extremely able and would be an excellent appointment,'' Wirth said
of Wise.
   Wise was not named to the Fed's consumer advisory council, but
he was put on the Fed's Thrift Institutions Advisory Council in
1985. He served on the citizens' advisory group for three years,
culminating as the president in 1987.
   The group meets four times a year with the Fed's Board of
Governors to discuss developments in the thrift industry.

<HEAD>License Requirements Eased</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department said Monday it is
dropping the requirements for export licenses on about $30 billion
worth of trade in computers, telecommunications equipment and other
high technology goods.
   Undersecretary Dennis Kloske said the liberalized requirements,
which will take effect in early July, will eliminate the need for
about 20,000 export licenses a year.
   The new requirements cover products shipped to U.S. allies in
the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls. The
17-nation group, known as COCOM, polices high-technology exports in
an effort to keep militarily sensitive products from being diverted
to communist countries.
   With the toppling of communist governments throughout Eastern
Europe, the United States has been under heavy pressure from its
allies to relax export restrictions.
   ``This new regulation is one of the most significant steps to
relax strategic trade controls with our COCOM allies in the
post-war era,'' Kloske said. ``It means giving U.S. businesses an
even better chance to compete in the international marketplace.''
   The department said it will continue to require licenses for
shipments of some sensitive high-technology items such as
supercomputers. The 20,000 export licenses being eliminated are
among 85,000 total export licenses issued each year by the U.S.
government.
   Still, the relaxed requirement, the outcome of three years of
negotiations, will bring the U.S. and its allies closer to a
``license-free zone'' within their borders.
   The announcement Monday will provide for additional streamlining
of controls beyond changes that were approved at a COCOM meeting
earlier this month in Paris. The Paris meeting dealt with
restrictions on the types of products which could be sold to former
communist bloc countries in Eastern Europe.

   Boeing 737 jetliners are now being produced at a
rate of 17 a month, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group said Monday.
   The company said in a news release that it had met its
previously announced goal of increased production for the small
twinjet, up from 14 per month earlier this year.
   Boeing, which has a backlog of 1,750 passenger jets, has been
increasing production rates throughout its product line. Production
of 747s went from two-and-a-half per month to five a month last
year, while 757 production went from five to seven planes a month
and 767s went from four to five in early 1990.
   Boeing plans to produce 382 jetliners, including five 707s for
military use, in 1990, up from 284 in 1989. The company was hit by
a 48-day machinists' strike last year, which effectively halted
production.

   Oil prices fell Monday under the combined
strength of an oil glut and the approaching end of trading on July
contracts.
   The July contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 68 cents to $15.94 a 42-gallon barrel
on the New York Mercentile Exchange. Later contract months posted
smaller losses. The price of the July contract had fallen 51 cents
Friday.
   ``The expiration of July contracts is putting pressure on the
market for nearby delivery,'' said William Byers, an oil market
analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. ``With a great supply of crude,
nobody wanted to take delivery right away.''
   The deadline for trading on July contracts is Wednesday. The
August contract was off 64 cents at $16.95.
   Home heating oil also dropped, with the July contract falling
.51 cent to 47.86 cents a gallon. Subsequent months fell by similar
amounts. Heating oil was off 0.13 cent Friday.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the New York Merc,
wholesale unleaded gasoline for July delivery rose 0.05 cents a
gallon to 61.56 cents. The contract had risen 1.39 cents Friday.
Subsequent months were also off.
   Prices for natural gas were lower, with the July contract down
to $1.540 1,000 cubic feet, from $1.547 on Friday. Other contracts
were down by similar amounts.

<TEXT>
   Japan and the United States have a long way to
go to improve trade relations, but some U.S. companies are
succeeding in the Japanese marketplace, U.S. Trade Representative
Carla A. Hills said Monday.
   ``Japan is not a completely closed society and the United States
isn't a collection of uncompetitive failing industries,'' Hills
said at the annual dinner of the Japan Society.
   Hills said U.S. exports to Japan last year were greater than our
exports to West Germany, France and Italy combined. Since 1986, she
said, Japan has increased its imports from all nations 64 percent.
   However, she said, ``the problem is that Japan should be doing
more. The United States should be doing more.''
   ``Our entrepreneurs must be permitted to trade and invest in
Japan as freely as Japanese entrepreneurs are able to trade and
invest here in the United States,'' she said.
   ``The American people will not be satisfied until all American
businesses can offer their goods and services in Japan in free and
open competition.''
   She said U.S. companies face obstacles in trying to market
products in Japan in the areas of digital computer networks,
telecommunications, auto parts, semiconductors and construction.
   Mrs. Hills noted that a U.S. company, Motorola, two weeks ago
beat out seven companies from Japan, the United States and Europe
in a contest to set standards for Japan's next generation of
digital cellular telephones.
   Unfortunately, she said, ``Under the rules of the competition,
Motorola must publish the design of its winning system and must
license other companies in Japan free of charge ... The United
States wants assurances that Motorola will be allowed to market its
system and win a piece of the digital cellular market in Japan.''
   The dinner was given in honor of Japan's influential film maker
Akira Kurosawa, who won the 1990 Japan Society Award for increasing
appreciation and understanding of Japanese society and culture.
   The Japan Society is a private, non-profit organization devoted
to cultural, educational and public affairs and improving
U.S.-Japan relations.

   The dollar fell against most other major
currencies Monday, buffeted by technical factors and expectations
of lower U.S. interest rates.
   Gold prices rose modestly overseas, but slipped lower in later
U.S trading.
   The dollar spent most of the day drifting downward in a
continued response to last week's U.S. producer and consumer price
reports. The data indicated weaker U.S. demand and heightened
prospects for interest rate cuts, dealers said.
   Traders believe the Federal Reserve, which sets the nation's
monetary policy, is more likely to nudge interest rates lower to
stimulate the economy amid signs of a slowdown. Such a move would
be bearish for the dollar, which is more attractive to investors
when U.S. rates are higher.
   Jerry Rothman, a trader with Merrill Lynch Futures, said there
was no news to affect the dollar and that investors were testing
the U.S. currency to see how far it will go.
   However, he said, the dollar likely was nearing its lows.
   ``It's really a technical market right now,'' a dealer in London
said.
   In Tokyo, where the dollar begins its day, the U.S. currency
closed at 153.88 yen, down 0.64 yen from Friday's close. Later in
London, the dollar was quoted at 153.75 yen. It fell to 153.65 yen

<HEAD>Motorola Reports Judge's Ruling in Chip Dispute as Temporary
Setback</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorola Inc. said a federal judge
indicated Monday he would require the company to pull a key
computer chip off the market until a lawsuit over the chip's patent
is resolved.
   But Motorola _ engaged in a legal fight over trade secrets with
former partner Hitachi Ltd. _ said it would appeal the decision
immediately after it is reported by U.S. District Judge Lucius
Bunton of Midland.
   In a statement from its Schaumburg, Ill. headquarters, Motorola
said such a decision might temporarily halt the sale of its
market-leading 68030 microprocessor, which is made in Austin.
   But Motorola said it expected the decision would be stayed on
appeal, and that it is confident it would continue to provide an
uninterrupted supply of the microprocessor to customers.
   Bunton's order was to be released through the federal district
clerk's office in Austin, according to his office. But the ruling
was unavailable by the time the office closed Monday at 5 p.m.,
said Deputy U.S. District Clerk Bob Williams.
   Motorola said Bunton had disclosed his intent to sign the order
but had not yet signed it.
   Tokyo-based Hitachi filed the motion with Bunton to temporarily
halt the sale of the Motorola microprocessor. An attorney for
Hitachi in Chicago, Jerry Solovy, had no immediate comment.
   Bunton banned the sale of the chip on March 29 and fined both
companies, saying they violated each other's patents.
   But the prohibition was reversed a day later after Motorola
argued that the chip sales ban could devastate outside computer
makers that depend on its microprocessors to run their machines.
   On Monday, Motorola said Bunton indicated he would lift his stay
on the injunction, thereby preventing Motorola from selling its
microprocessor and Hitachi from selling its own, dubbed the H8-532.
   Tim Kellogg, spokesman for Motorola, said the company would file
its appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
following Bunton's decision. The court is a special appeals court
for patents and customs in Washington.
   ``We are confident that the CAFC will promptly stay the lower
court's decision, pending appeal,'' Motorola said in a statement.
   It added, ``We are dismayed that Judge Bunton made this decision
knowing full well that the two parties have been engaged in earnest
attempts to settle this matter.''

   Namibia, newly independent of South Africa,
has asked to join the International Monetary Fund, the fund
announced Monday.
   Switzerland, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia also are seeking to
join the 152 governments that are now members. The fund lends only
to member countries to help with short-term balance of payments
difficulties.
   Membership in the fund is followed by membership in its sister
organization, the World Bank, the biggest source of long-term
development aid to Third World countries.
