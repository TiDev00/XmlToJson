   The Communist Party agreed to
withdraw 90 to 100 of its deputies before the month is out to
become a minority party, ending 41 years of Communist dominance in
Parliament, a Civic Forum spokesman said Friday.
   Spokesman Petr Pithart told journalists the agreement came late
Thursday at negotiations among the Communists, the Civic Forum
opposition movement and other political parties.
   The Communists now hold more than 200 of the 350 seats in
Parliament.
   The remaining seats are held by members of parties that in the
past were allied with the Communists but have become increasingly
independent, and by some non-party members.
   Negotiators agreed that parliamentary elections will be held
June 8.
   Pithart said, ``It has been agreed that all the vacant seats
will be available to non-party members and candidates will be
proposed by the Civic Forum in the Czech lands and Public Against
Violence in Slovakia.''
   Civic Forum and Public Against Violence are sister
organizations. They represent a loose grouping of reformist forces
and opposition groups in Czechoslovakia trying to eliminate
Communist domination in political life.
   The concession was the latest by the Communists here in the past
two months following revolutionary changes that led to
establishment of a coalition government not dominated by Communists.
   Pithart said the talks produced consensus on ``rough principles
of the new parliamentary elections.''
   Among them:
   _ ``Every party that wants to run its candidates in the
elections must have at least 1O.OOO members or ... enough
signatures to total 10,000,'' with the deadline for registering
mid-April.
   _ Each party will have to obtain a minimum 5 percent of the
national vote to have a deputy in parliament.
   _ ``All these measures represent a way of preventing minute
parties from getting into Parliament. All the participants agreed
on the need for a strong government based on the new Parliament and
that small parties could endanger the future coalition.''
   _ ``The elections will take place on the principle of
proportionate representation in 12 districts, roughly identical
with the present regional structure in Czechoslovakia.''
   _ The state will reimburse campaign costs based on the number of
seats won.

<HEAD>Chicago Ethics Chief Quits After Being Tied to Louisiana Money
Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The newly appointed director of the city's Board
of Ethics resigned Thursday after it was disclosed he had been
named in a lawsuit for alleged violations of Louisiana campaign
financing regulations.
   Gary M. O'Neill, who served about a month as executive director
of the Chicago Board of Ethics, was accused of violating Louisiana
regulations while helping that state's Commissioner of Insurance
Doug Green finance his successful 1987 election campaign.
   In his resignation letter, O'Neill said he was quitting his job
as head of the agency that enforces the city's ethics and financial
disclosure laws ``because of my failure to disclose the fact that I
was named in a civil complaint filed by the Louisiana Ethics
Commission.''
   ``At no time has there been any finding of civil or criminal
wrongdoing,'' his letter said.
   O'Neill said he did not want his failure to discuss the matter
when he was being interviewed for the job ``to reflect adversely on
the Board or the work to be done.''
   After submitting his resignation, O'Neill said it is
``unfortunate that people who aspire to public office have things
happen in their lives that do come back to be a cloud over their
head.''
   Johnnie DeWilde, the ethics board's current deputy director, was
appointed acting executive director effective immediately, the
board announced.
   O'Neill resigned one day after The Morning Advocate, a Baton
Rouge, La., newspaper revealed that he had been named as a
defendant in a lawsuit by the Louisiana Board of Ethics for Elected
Officials.
   The lawsuit accuses Green of attempting to conceal the true
source of $2.2 million in contributions to Green's 1987 campaign.
   The lawsuit said the campaign funds went from O'Neill and others
to a company controlled by the head of a now-defunct insurance
agency. The insurance agency, Champion Insurance Co., was regulated
by Green's office.
   The state's lawsuit was thrown out of a state district court in
Baton Rouge last year when the ethics board's enforcement
provisions were declared unconstitutional by a state judge. A
rehearing of the issue is pending before the Louisiana Supreme
Court.
   O'Neill, 38, had a successful law practice and was active in
Louisiana politics. He said he has been traveling extensively since
he left Baton Rouge on May 1, and did not keep in contact with his
law practice or state affairs.
   The Morning Advocate said he dropped out of sight last spring
shortly before his law firm's chief client, Champion, was placed in
court-ordered liquidation.
   The disclosure about the lawsuit against O'Neill surprised
Chicago officials.
   ``If we had known about the allegations against Mr. O'Neill, we
would not have hired him as executive director,'' Albert Hofeld,
the ethics board's chairman, said Thursday.
   ``It's not that we think he's done anything wrong, but it places
a cloud over the ethics board.''
   O'Neill said he did not mention the Louisiana ethics case during
his interview for the Chicago job because he considered the matter
concluded.
   ``I didn't try to keep any information from them at all,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Former President Says Visit With Paralyzed Patients An Inspiration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SANDRA WALEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Richard M. Nixon mixed a little
football and foreign affairs during a visit Thursday to the Miami
Project to Cure Paralysis, and praised patients for their courage
and tenacity.
   Nixon, a strong supporter of the project and longtime friend of
its founder, Nick Buoniconti, spoke with paralyzed patients working
on state-of-the-art equipment during a 30-minute tour of the
facility located at the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial
Center.
   Nixon, a frequent visitor to Miami during his presidency with a
compound in nearby Key Biscayne and close ties to South Florida
banker Charles G. ``Bebe'' Rebozo, appeared relaxed. He smiled,
asked questions and expressed admiration for those left paralyzed
from spinal cord injuries.
   Buoniconti and his son, Marc, who was left a quadriplegic after
being injured in 1985 during a college football game, were among
those showing Nixon the world-renowned facility.
   ``Sometimes all of us feel life's a little tough,'' Nixon told
reporters later. ``We have some problems, disappointments. Whenever
you get discouraged, you should think of these people. ... It's
been an inspiration to me to go through this facility.''
   On other matters, the former president called the recent lifting
of martial law in China ``an important symbolic step that can have
a significant effect in the future.''
   ``There's no question in my mind this will be followed by other
steps,'' he said. ``It indicates the Chinese don't want to be left
outside of the world community.''
   _ He had no comment about ousted Panamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega,
who is in Miami awaiting trial on drug trafficking charges. But
Nixon noted that getting Noriega out of Panama ``was the easy part.
Now the difficult part comes'' in rebuilding the Central American
country.
   _ On changes in Eastern Europe, Nixon said technological
developments in communication had played a significant role in
releasing the forces of revolt.
   ``Four years ago, you had to go under borders and across
borders. Now you go over borders,'' and there's no stopping the
flow of information, he said.
   _ On Cuba and the effects of upheaval in Eastern Europe and
Panama, ``No question, if I were in Castro's place I'd be
concerned,'' Nixon said.
   Nixon, who says he still visits South Florida occasionally,
heaped accolades on Nick Buoniconti, a friend since 1972 when he
was a linebacker with the Super Bowl champion Miami Dolphins.
   ``He made a difference in the No Name defense,'' said Nixon, who
was presented with a football autographed by the project's doctors
and scientists. ``He's made a difference now in a much bigger way
with this project.''
   About 500,000 Americans are paralyzed every year as a result of
injuries. Each year, there are about 10,000 new injuries. The Miami
Prject was founded in 1985 and serves as a research center as well
as providing clinical treatment.
   Last year, Nixon was chairman of the Great Sports Legends dinner
in New York City, which raised $1.1 million for the Miami Project.

   A study of 643 people killed in New York City
traffic accidents shows that 18.2 percent had used cocaine within
48 hours of the accident.
   Of those 643, blood-alcohol and cocaine tests were available for
378 drivers, and 56 percent had used one or both.
   ``This will be a national problem,'' the lead researcher, Dr.
Peter M. Marzuk, said Thursday. ``I think if you looked at driver
fatalities in other large cities you might find relatively
comparable results.''
   Marzuk and colleagues at Cornell University Medical College in
New York City and at the New York City medical examiner's office
looked at records on all 905 traffic fatalities of passengers or
drivers from 1984 through 1987. The study excluded fatalities
involving pedestrians, bicyclists or people getting out of vehicles.
   Appropriate autopsy findings were available for 643 of the
fatally injured drivers and passengers, and 18.2 percent showed
evidence of cocaine use within 48 hours before the accident, the
researchers reported in Friday's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
   Among the drivers _ 70 percent of the 643 _ the prevalence of
cocaine use was 20 percent. Of the drivers ages 16 to 45, the
prevalence was 24.3 percent, the researchers wrote.
   ``That's high. That's the highest I've seen,'' said Steven Gust,
a research psychologist with the National Institute on Drug Abuse
in Rockville, Md.
   Previous studies have found prevalences ranging from 3 percent
to 11 percent, he said in a telephone interview, adding that
regional differences in cocaine use exist, and New York is one of
the highest-use cities.
   Blood-alcohol tests were available for only 378 of the drivers
killed, and of those, 56 percent showed evidence of cocaine or
alcohol or both in their bodies, the study said.
   By assuming all 262 fatalities excluded from the study were
cocaine free, the most conservative estimate of overall cocaine use
would have been 14.1 percent, the researchers said. But they
believe their results underestimated prevalence because some
individuals who had used low doses of cocaine might have gone
undetected.
   The authors cautioned that their findings do not prove cocaine
use caused accidents.
   ``It could be that cocaine users are lousy drivers ... and it
may have nothing to do with cocaine,'' Marzuk said in a telephone
interview.
   However, the study said there are several reasons to suggest
that cocaine might compromise driving ability.
   ``Minutes after cocaine administration, users report feeling
hyperalert and euphoric, but can also report aggressiveness,
irritability, psychotic distortions, and a tendency toward greater
risk-taking,'' it said.
   Several hours to days after using the drug, addicts report
feeling edgy, anxious, confused and-or sleepy, it added.
   To offset some of cocaine's unpleasant effects, many users
resort to sedatives, most often alcohol, the researchers wrote.
   ``It's still true by far that alcohol is the most important
contributor to motor vehicle fatalities,'' Marzuk said. ``But many
cocaine users, especially crack users, are alcoholics.''
   He called for further study of the effects of cocaine and
alcohol on driving, and the authors said screenings of injured
accident victims could lead to identifying people in need of drug
treatment.
   However, such screening would be difficult, said Robert
Borkenstein, past president of the International Committee on
Alchol, Drugs and Traffic Safety.
   ``The trouble is that there are so many variations of ... drugs.
They all have different pharmacological effects,'' he said in a
telephone interview from Indiana, adding that addicts to
amphetamines and cocaine develop a tolerance to the drugs to a much
greater degree than people do to alcohol.
   ``People are not alike as far as their response to alcohol is
concerned,'' the retired Indiana University professor said. ``But
it is much closer than for any other drug.''

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Redoubt Volcano's tantrums have not
been as destructive as Mount St. Helens', but they have interrupted
oil production and international travel and closed schools for
thousands of youngsters.
   Earlier this week, 10,000 face masks were distributed to
residents of the central Kenai Peninsula worried about inhaling the
fine volcanic ash _ gritty, highly abrasive bits of pulverized lava
_ that the volcano has blown as high as eight miles into the
atmosphere.
   ``The quake activity indicates the volcano is relatively quiet
for now and it does not appear to be building toward stronger
eruptive activity,'' geologist Steve Brantley of the Alaska Volcano
Observatory said Wednesday. Still, a major eruption like last
Monday's is possible, he said.
   There's no telling how long the seismic activity will continue,
and the mountain could spew ash intermittently for years, Brantley
said.
   Mount St. Helens in Washington state erupted explosively in May
1980, levelling hundreds of square miles of forest, blowing ash so
high into the atmosphere it circled the globe, killing 57 people
and causing over $3 billion in damage.
   Redoubt, which roared back to life Dec. 14 after 25 years of
quiet, is not only smaller but also more remote, sitting 115 miles
southwest of Anchorage.
   But it still has the power to disrupt commerce and everyday life.
   Redoubt's threat forced the closure Tuesday of the Drift River
oil storage terminal, 20 miles from the volcano, and much of the
Cook Inlet offshore oil field that the facility serves.
   The terminal, with 38 million gallons of oil in its tanks, sits
near the Drift River, which has overflowed with water from snow and
glaciers melted by Redoubt's internal heat. The river flooded
extensively during the volcano's last eruption.
   The affected fields contributed much of the $23.3 million in
royalties Alaska collected last year from Cook Inlet production,
said said Chuck Logsden, a petroleum economist with the Department
of Revenue.
   Because the airborne ash threatens aircraft engines, traffic at
Anchorage International Airport came to a virtual halt shortly
before Christmas, stranding hundreds of passengers and Christmas
mail deliveries, and was patchy after another eruption Jan. 2.
   Redoubt's ash shut down all four engines on a KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines 747, and the big jet glided from 25,000 to 12,000 feet in
12 minutes before the crew could get the engines restarted.
   Although recent ash eruptions have spared air routes leading to
Anchorage, some international carriers that used Anchorage as a
refueling stop continue to divert planes elsewhere.
   The diversions are being felt in the city, where airline crews
stay in hotels and shop.
   ``It is during December and January that hotels are most
appreciative of the airline business,'' said Forest J. Paulson,
general manager of the Sheraton Anchorage Hotel. Alaska gets few
tourists during the winter.
   There is concern that international carriers that rerouted
because of the volcano will find the alternative refueling stops
desirable and stick with them. Since Redoubt came to life, Soviet
officials have been opening Siberian routes more readily than
before, said Jon Ungar, controller for the Alaska International
Airport System.
   Even on the ground, street traffic on the central Kenai
Peninsula is affected by the ash.
   ``We've had a lot of requests for filter changes,'' said Lewis
Fowler, manager of Tom's Automotive in Soldotna. Engine problems
and auto-body corrosion are among the foremost concerns, he said.
   Health problems have been not been overwhelming, but they
include nosebleeds among people who work outdoors and an increase
in respiratory ailments among the elderly, said Dr. George Garnett,
a health adviser to Kenai Peninsula Borough.
   The ash is like finely broken glass, Garnett said.
   ``Microscopically, it is actually harder than glass,'' he said.
Inhalation can result in tiny, internal cuts that create irritation.
   School closures in effect at least through Thursday affected
more than 5,000 students, partly for health reasons and partly to
keep the dusty grit outside.
   On the other hand, the tourism industry sees a potential ray of
economic sunshine.
   ``We've been talking about the fact that there are some tour
companies that might see Redoubt as an attraction _ `Come see the
little volcano that did,''' said Keith Fernandez, marketing
director for the Anchorage Convention and Visitors Bureau.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if some enterprising business said,
`Yeah, I bet I could make it work.'''

<HEAD>Comatose Woman Who Had Abortion Making Progess</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who went to the U.S. Supreme Court to
obtain an abortion for his comatose wife says she has been making
steady progress since regaining consciousness in June, according to
news reports.
   Martin Klein told WCBS-TV on Thursday that his wife, Nancy, is
making slow but steady progress, that she is talking slowly and
learning to feed herself. WNYW-TV reported that Mrs. Klein was out
of a coma and making progress.
   The Associated Press reported in June that the woman was out of
her coma, making slow progress but still unable to speak.
   The New York Times in its Friday editions reported that Mrs.
Klein is able to talk, is slowly regaining her memory and wants to
go home to her husband and their 4-year-old daughter Arielle.
   Doctors 11 months ago performed an abortion on Mrs. Klein, but
only after her husband fought abortion foes all the way to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   ``She's doing amazingly well,'' Dr. Caroline O. McCagg, medical
director of the Center for Head Injuries at the Robert Wood Johnson
Jr. Rehabilitation Institute in Edison, N.J., told the Times.
``She's made slow constant progress. It's incredible.''
   Mrs. Klein, who was 18 weeks pregnant, lapsed into a coma after
she was in a car accident on Dec. 13, 1988. Although her chances of
emerging from the coma were slim, doctors told her husband that her
chances would improve slightly if she had an abortion.
   But when he sought to have the abortion performed, he was
challenged by anti-abortion factions and a legal battle ensued
which eventually was resolved by the nation's top court.
   The abortion made it safer for Mrs. Klein to receive medication,
McCagg told the Times.
   ``Nancy is a fighter,'' Klein told the newspaper. ``I hate to
say `I told you so,' but it helps to confirm in my mind that I made
the correct decision.''

<TEXT>
   Anti-abortion groups intend to project a more moderate image
this year as they lobby state legislatures in the aftermath of the
Supreme Court's Webster decision. But they will face re-energized
opposition, not just from pro-choice groups but from their own
movement's hard-liners.
   With public opinion polls showing a majority of Americans in
favor of legalized abortion, some anti-abortion groups have scaled
back their goals to restrictions they believe are publicly
acceptable.
   Those measures _ including bills banning abortion as a form of
birth control and requiring minors to get parents' permission for
an abortion _ will face legislators in most states when 1990
sessions begin this month.
   Virtually every legislature that is meeting this year will
consider some form of abortion legislation, and it will be a major
issue in many states, including Alabama, Illinois, Maryland,
Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island and
Virginia.
   ``This issue is the most controversial issue any legislature
will deal with in the next decade,'' said Alabama state Sen. Chip
Bailey, who opposes abortion.
   Alabama's legislature will consider two bills aimed at banning
abortion as a means of birth control, leaving it legal only in
certain cases. Anti-abortion groups already are battling over what
those exceptions should be _ one sign of a rift that seems to be
growing.
   One group, Alabama Citizens for Life, supports a bill that would
allow abortions in four instances: rape, incest, when a woman's
life is in danger, or when a pregnancy would produce an infant with
``profound or irremediable'' deformities.
   But another group, the Alabama Pro-Life Coalition, opposes
abortion in cases involving deformities. Legislators are cught in
the middle _ and not happy to be there.
   ``If I had any advice, I'd say to the people interested in this
to get together and decide on legislation that might get through
the legislature,'' said House Judiciary Committee Chairman G.J.
``Dutch'' Higgenbotham.
   The Alabama split mirrors a national debate about the direction
of the anti-abortion movement, which has been stung by a strong
pro-choice backlash in the six months since the Supreme Court
upheld Missouri's abortion law.
   Some groups remain zealously committed to fighting abortion in
all forms, while others, such as the National Right to Life
Committee, are now willing to compromise.
   Burke Balch, state legislative coordinator for National Right to
Life, said the group is only supporting legislation ``that has
strong support in the polls.''
   ``We think we're putting forth legislation that stands a good
chance of being upheld by the current (Supreme) Court, and that is
legislation that doesn't outright ban abortion but bans some of the
more egregious forms,'' he added.
   More radical anti-abortion groups believe there can be no
compromise in an issue with such strong religious and moral
overtones.
   Brian Young, director of model legislation for the hard-line
American Life League, conceded there was ``perhaps a difference of
opinion'' among anti-abortion groups.
   Young said his group would continue to fight all abortions. ``I
think you'll find, among the grass roots, a sentiment that we don't
abandon some classes of babies out of political expediency,'' he
said.
   Pro-choice advocates tend to dismiss such distinctions, and
recoil at the notion of ``moderate'' anti-abortion legislation.
   ``All of the anti-choice legislation ... is extremist,'' said
Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights
Action League. ``There is nothing moderate in any of these
campaigns. They all are aimed at undoing this right.''
   To strike back, pro-choice advocates are proposing legislation
in at least five states, Illinois, Michigan, Maryland, New
Hampshire and Ohio, that would guarantee a woman's right to an
abortion.
   They also are taking the battle to court, and won an early
victory Thursday when a federal judge blocked sections of
Pennsylvania's tough new abortion law from going into effect. Those
sections require women to notify their husbands and wait 24 hours
before having abortions.
   Most of the action around the country is being propelled by the
anti-abortion movement, however.
   In Michigan, the hottest item on the legislative agenda is a
bill to require minors to get approval from at least one parent
before getting an abortion.
   According to groups that track abortion legislation, at least
eight other states will consider bills to require parental consent
or notification. They are Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri,
New Jersey, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.
   At least seven will consider legislation to ban public funding
of abortion: California, Hawaii, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, New
Mexico and West Virginia.
   And at least nine states will consider legislation to outlaw
abortion as a form of birth control. They are Alabama, California,
Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri and
Tennessee.
   Indiana, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Virginia are
expected to take up bills that mirror the Missouri law that the
Supreme Court upheld last July 3. That law bans abortions in public
hospitals and stops public employees from counseling women about
abortion, among other things.
   The court is still considering the legality of parental consent
laws in Ohio and Minnesota. But it has not yet taken up a case that
poses a direct threat to Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision that
required states to legalize abortion.
   For now, Balch said, the National Right to Life Committee has
set aside its goal of getting legislation passed that directly
challenges Roe. What the group wants, he said, is ``not an outright
assault on Roe, but a very substantial modication of it.''
   That goal is not universally shared. Young said the American
Life League's goal is ``to get a case to the court that will
challenge Roe vs. Wade directly.''
   Speaking about abortion in general, Young added: ``It's going to
be, at this point, a highly politicized issue and _ it's no secret
_ a very emotional, very hot issue. ... It's something that's not
going to be decided in one year. It's going to go on and on.''

   An official of the largest
anti-Sandinista bloc says it has yet to receive a penny of $9
million approved by the U.S. Congress in October to help in its
political campaign, and time is running out.
   Antonio Lacayo of the 14-party United National Opposition (UNO)
accused the leftist Sandinista government of dragging its feet to
release money that was meant to train poll watchers for the Feb. 25
election, just six weeks away.
   ``If for lack of funds these programs cannot take place, it's
impossible for us to say that these elections are free and
honest,'' Lacayo, UNO's campaign manager, said Thursday.
   He said without a UNO representative at each of the 4,394
polling stations nationwide, the opposition will not be able to
effectively monitor voting in the general elections and watch out
for possible fraud.
   UNO's presidential candidate, publisher Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro, is President Daniel Ortega's main rival in his bid for
re-election. Nicaraguans also will choose a National Assembly and
municipal governments.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said Wednesday it was
``troublesome'' that some of the $9 million the United States sent
to help the opposition has been held up in banking bureaucracy and
red tape.
   ``We expect free and fair elections to take place,'' Popadiuk
said. But he added: ``We've noticed that the Nicaraguans have been
harassing the opposition to a great extent, all of which is
counterproductive to an election process going forward smoothly.''
   UNO says it is at a disadvantage in the campaign and accuses the
Sandinistas of using state resources for party purposes.
   The Supreme Electoral Council, responsible for all matters
regarding the elections, last Dec. 20 approved the deposit of
$3,584,370 in the Central Bank.
   This is part of the $9 million in a congressional measure signed
into law by President Bush on Oct. 21. Most of the money is to be
channeled through the National Endowment for Democracy, funded by
the U.S. government.
   Under Nicaraguan law, foreign donations in cash must be split
evenly between the recipient party and the electoral council's Fund
for Democracy, to help defray the cost of the electoral process.
   UNO and the Fund for Democracy are to get $1.8 million each from
the $9 million, Lacayo said.
   An additional $1.5 million is to be split between the Fund for
Democracy and an institute founded by UNO members to help train
poll watchers and promote civic education.
   But only $400,000 has been deposited in the Central Bank, said
electoral council secretary Rosa Marina Zelaya.
   Lacayo said half of that is for UNO's Institute for Electoral
Promotion and Training.
   ``Our donors said there would be no more money until we could
see how that would go through,'' Lacayo said.
   He said a snag developed in trying to get permission from the
Ministry of External Cooperation to release the funds from the
Central Bank.
   Lacayo said that after being shunted from bureaucrat to
bureaucrat for three weeks, the UNO institute people were told by
the ministry's director of donations, Xiomara Ortega, that
institute bylaws did not specify it was a non-profit organization.
   The bylaws would have to be rewritten before the ministry would
agree to authorize release of the money, Lacayo reported, adding:
   ``There won't be enough time for training.''
   Asked exactly how much of the $9 million UNO has received so
far, Lacayo put his index finger and thumb together and looked
through the hole. ``Zero,'' he said. ``That's exactly how much.''
   UNO has been paying for secretaries, vehicles, technical aid,
equipment and the like out of private funds. Grumbling has started.
   One businessman said he is owed nearly $20,000 and ``if they
don't pay me soon, I'm going to have to cut them out. I like them
but I am a businessman. I'm not in this for fun.''
   In the midst of an interview at his office, Lacayo told a
telephone caller, ``Just tell them there isn't any (money) for the
gunpowder, nothing for the musicians or even to buy a Coke.''
   Musicians and gunpowder for firecrackers typically enliven
Nicaraguan political rallies.
   Council spokesman Adolfo Beteta said UNO has received donations,
such as caps, T-shirts and plastic flags, worth at least $73,000.
Electoral law exempts these items from taxation.
   Beteta said one donor was the Miami-based Committee of Friends
of Democracy and another was ``a Guatemalan citizen,'' but that he
had no more information on donors.
   Ms. Zelaya said the Sandinista Front has received $126,000 in
cash donations from abroad, half of it going to the Fund for
Democracy.

<HEAD>Quayle Latin America Trip Already on a Stormy Course</HEAD>

   Vice President Dan Quayle's mission to soothe
Latin American ire over the U.S. invasion of Panama is on a stormy
course even before his itinerary is set, diplomatic sources said.
   ``People are very skeptical about it. You invade and then you
try to convince us that an invasion is not an invasion. He tries to
patronize us,'' said a Costa Rican official, referring to President
Bush.
   Quayle's office said no Latin countries have refused to talk to
the vice president, but other sources said sentiment in Venezuela
is such that Caracas could signal it does not welcome a visit at
this time.
   ``Maybe the government will say, `OK, you are welcome, but in
two or three years,''' said one diplomatic source, laughing to
indicate he was exaggerating the Venezuelan resistance to the
Quayle trip.
   Venezuela has been one of the harshest critics of the military
action.
   Some countries welcomed Bush's gesture in sending Quayle to
explain the invasion of Panama. ``It's a gesture, no?'' asked an
official from one nation.
   But other Latin diplomats predicted Quayle will have a tough
time succeeding at what Bush termed ``very, very important
diplomacy'' in presenting the U.S. rationale for the military
invasion.
   The Costa Rican said in a telephone interview Thursday from San
Jose that his country, because of its pro-U.S. stance, will welcome
Quayle, but predicted reaction in some South American nations will
likely be ``very icy.''
   The White House has not announced what countries Quayle will
visit or a timetable for the trip other than that he will keep a
previous commitment to attend the Jan. 27 presidential inauguration
in Honduras.
   Stops in several Central American and South American nations
could come in a subsequent trip, as well as further opportunities
for discussions with heads of state during Quayle's expected
attendance at the March presidential inaugurations in Brazil and
Chile.
   Bush and other officials have acknowledged the invasion of
Panama strained U.S. relations with Latin nations. The Organization
of American States voted to deplore the military action.
   By sending Quayle to the region, Bush said he hoped to explain
his reasons for the invasion and convince Latins of ``the truth _
and that is that we are not just reverting to just a willful ...
use of force that has no rationale.''
   But Latin officials say it will take some major convincing, and
some say it's not the best time for Quayle to visit.
   ``The people of Latin America will be more comfortable if the
United States gets its troops home as soon as possible and helps
Panama carry out an election,'' said one Latin diplomatic source in
Washington.
   Asked about those rumblings, which also surfaced in Caracas
media reports, one administration official tersely replied: ``Just
as we're always happy to accommodate the visits by Caribbean and
Latin leaders, I'm sure they will be pleased to welcome the vice
president.''
   ``I have no indication that Venezuela or anyone else is not
willing to talk with us,'' said Quayle's press secretary, David
Beckwith.
   Venezuela abstained from the OAS vote deploring the invasion,
saying the resolution was not strong enough and should have tied
recognition of the U.S.-installed government of President Guillermo
Endara to withdrawal of the U.S. invasion troops.
   In 1958, Vice President Richard Nixon was confronted by an
angry, rock-throwing mob in Caracas during a goodwill tour to
several Latin American countries. Rioters attacked the stalled
cars, shattered windows in Nixon's limousine and tried to drag
Nixon and his wife, Patricia, from the car. The motorcade managed
to escape the mob.
   The Latin countries, like the United States, opposed the
dictatorship of Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, but they
have voiced dismay at what they see as U.S. heavy-handedness in
invading to topple him.
   Latin diplomats, whose national economies are tightly interwoven
with U.S. assistance, were cautious in discussing the Quayle trip
and spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   ``Something had to be done with Noriega, but that doesn't mean
an invasion _ an uninvited invasion,'' said a Bolivian diplomatic
source. The source said it was hoped that Quayle's trip would
produce more than the already voiced U.S. explanation.
   ``The symbolism will play a very important role, but if he has
something significant to say, of course that will be very
important,'' the diplomat said.
   Quayle's trip is only one step in mending relations, said
another South American diplomat.
   ``There must be future steps.''

<HEAD>Administration Will Push for Alternative Fuel Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, facing strong
opposition from the auto and oil industries, is trying to revive
its plan to make alternative fuel cars readily available in some of
the most polluted cities and ``break the monopoly'' of gasoline.
   William Rosenberg, associate administrator at the Environmental
Protection Agency, told a Senate hearing Thursday that the
alternative fuel program is ``a vital and integral part'' of hopes
of getting air quality within federal standards in nine urban
centers.
   A phase-in of cars and small trucks powered by fuels other than
gasoline was a key part of President Bush's clean air package sent
to Congress last year. The proposal envisioned up to a million such
cars being sold annually by the late 1990s.
   But the requirement was removed from clean air legislation in
the House and was never included in the Senate because of intense
pressure from both the auto industry and oil companies. Among the
less polluting fuels seen as alternatives to gasoline are methanol,
ethanol, natural gas, propane and various blends.
   Administration officials and environmentalists hope to reinstate
the alternative fuel provision into clean air legislation that is
moving toward floor consideration in both the House and Senate.
   Rosenberg, the administration point man on clean air matters,
told the Senate Environment and Public Works environmental
protection subcommittee that efforts to clean up the worst urban
smog would be fruitless without use of alternative fuel cars.
   The only other way to meet federal air quality requirements at
the turn of the century will be to dramatically restrict automobile
use, an option he said is not considered appropriate.
   Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, the committee's ranking
Republican, said he plans to offer anamendment that would require
automakers to begin making 150,000 alternative fuel vehicles
available in California within four years and phase in similar cars
in eight other urban areas beginning in 1997.
   Under the Chafee proposal, nearly a third of the cars sold in
the nine cities would be powered by fuel or a blend other than
gasoline by 1999 and fleet owners in severely polluted areas would
have to begin phasing in ``ultra clean'' fuel cars, including
electric-powered vehicles, beginning in 1997.
   ``Just cleaning up the tailpipe (emissions) on cars hasn't been
enough to assure healthy air quality,'' said Chafee, who said
tighter pollution controls on individual gasoline powered cars are
often offset by the increasing number of cars on the road.
   The automakers have opposed any federal requirement for
alternative fuel vehicles, arguing the sale of such cars should not
be required by the government unless separate measures such as tax
incentives also are offered to ensure a market for the vehicles.
   ``We know very little about how U.S. consumers will respond to
alternative fuels and the vehicles that use them,'' said James
Fitzpatrick, vice president for General Motors Corp., in testimony
before the subcommittee.
   If Congress requires such cars, it also should require
incentives to stimulate consumer demand and ease stringent tailpipe
emission controls already in the clean air bill in the Senate, said
Donald Buist of the Ford Motor Co.
   But leading Democrats in the Senate say that although they favor
alternative fuel car development, they are not prepared to trade a
clean fuel car program for more relaxed tailpipe emissions
standards already in the Senate bill.
   ``I want to be clear .... one is not a substitute for the
other,'' Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the subcommittee,
said Thursday in commenting on Chafee's proposal.
   But Baucus and other senators expressed concern that consumers
might not buy the alternative fuel cars.
   ``The automakers must have the responsibility to provide
incentives,'' Rosenberg replied. ``We're not talking about crazy
cars. We're talking about cars similar to those already on the road.
   ``We think they'll sell very well.''
   According to the EPA, the cities where air quality is so poor
that alternative fuel cars would be required are: Los Angeles,
where local officials already are development similar requirements;
Houston; New York; Chicago; Milwaukee; Baltimore; Philadelphia; San
Diego; and Hartford, Conn.

<HEAD>Air Force Says Bomber Needs $170 Million More to Fight Fires</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Congress, concerned about the increasing cost
of the B-1 bomber, is facing an additional expense with recent Air
Force estimates that installation of a fire protection system will
cost about $170 million.
   Documents released on Capitol Hill Thursday show that putting a
fire detection and isolation system in the fleet of strategic
aircraft will cost about $99 million and a fire suppression system
is $70 million.
   ``It's amazing that we have to spend this much,'' Rep. John
Kasich, R-Ohio, a member of the House Armed Services Committee who
requested the figures, said in a telephone interview from Ohio.
``That's what happens when we build things too quickly.''
   The Air Force has stressed need for the system as a result of a
November 1988 accident near Dyess Air Force Base in Texas in which
wings sweeping back on the bomber penetrated fuel lines and touched
off a fire.
   ``We did not have sufficient fire suppression in the overwing,''
said Air Force Lt. Richard Cole, referring to the section that
houses the wing where it is attached to the fuselage.
   Cole said the fire detection and suppression system is ``an
outgrowth of the accident.''
   All four crew members ejected safely from the aircraft before
the crash, the third since the B-1 began flying in 1985 as the
nation's first long-range bomber in more than 25 years.
   The Air Force point paper said the service plans to go ahead
with the fire detection and isolation system using money from
existing accounts.
   However, the Air Force is looking to Congress to pay for the
suppression system.
   Asked if Congress will accept the expense, Kasich said: ``The
B-1 clearly has to be fixed. The B-1 preserves our option for
canceling stealth.''
   Kasich has been an outspoken critic of the B-2 stealth bomber,
the radar-evading plane that carries a pricetag of about $530
million apiece.
   The B-1, a four-engine, swing-wing bomber, is designed to fill
the gap between the aging B-52 and the stealth bomber in the Air
Force arsenal.
   The B-1 has a maximum speed of about 1,000 mph and a range of
more than 7,000 miles. It is smaller than the B-52 but capable of
carrying more bombs, and already holds a number of world aviation
speed records for a plane of its size.
   The B-1, killed by President Carter in 1977, was resurrected
four years later by President Reagan, who said the plane was needed
to update the nation's aging force of nuclear-armed bombers.
   Reagan ordered 100 B-1s, at a cost of $20.5 billion. Three have
crashed, leaving the service with 97 of the planes. The Air Force
has already received all the B-1s it intends to buy and is
proceeding with plans to buy the B-2 stealth bomber.
   In addition to needing the fire system, the B-1 has been plagued
with problems over its defensive avionics, or electronic
countermeasures system. The avionics were designed to improve the
bomber's chances of penetrating the Soviet Union by allowing the
aircraft's crew to avoid, degrade and deceive the Soviet air
defenses.
   The problems involve the system's radar warning receiver and
processor function.
   In its fiscal 1990 defense bill, a Congress wary of the B-1
problems imposed strict test-before-you-buy requirements on the Air
Force and its avionics system.
   The House report on the bill said the test program ``will
provide the basis for the Congress to determine whether the
proposed modifications will provide an increase in penetration
capability commensurate with the additional costs, which will be
about $1 billion.''

   Lucille Ball ``was not funny off stage'' and
Desi Arnaz ``ended up a drunk,'' but daughter Lucie Arnaz said she
doesn't resent her parents.
   Her mom was ``a control freak,'' Arnaz said on ``The Joan Rivers
Show'' taped Tuesday. The show will be telecast Monday.
   ``She had to be in charge 24 hours a day,'' Arnaz went on. ``She
loved us in her own way. I'm sure she loved us in the only way she
knew how.''
   Desi used to say that Lucille was ``soooo funny,'' but,
according to his daughter, Desi was ``a lot funnier'' than Lucille.
   ``I mean, as far as doing the physical stuff, she (Lucy) was the
queen. But ... I get my humor from my dad, not from her _ which is
odd, but I do. He's a naturally funny kind of guy. And he always
used to see things funny, so that's kind of depressing that he
ended up a drunk.''
   Arnaz said her father ``never got the acclaim that I think he
deserved, because he was the brains behind all that comedy talent.''
   An actress herself, Arnaz added: ``God knows, I love my parents.
I don't carry a lot of resentment about that because I'm in the
business and I'm doing all right.''

   A producer who specializes in handling
hot-blooded talent has been brought in to smooth relations between
Roseanne Barr and the producers of her top-ranked ABC-TV comedy
series ``Roseanne.''
   Jay Daniel, a former producer at ABC's ``Moonlighting,'' joined
``Roseanne'' with the title of executive producer for Carsey-Werner
Productions, David Brokaw, a spokesman for the company, said
Thursday.
   Miss Barr reportedly has wanted her character to express more
anger than the producers and writers would agree to. She had the
show's creator and original executive producer, Matt Williams,
fired, and recently asked to get rid of his successor, Jeff Harris.
   ``We're looking to make Roseanne happier,'' said Marcy Carsey of
Carsey-Werner. ``Roseanne feels she needs another person to listen
to her. So whatever we can do to make her happy we'll do. The shows
are wonderful, so whatever Roseanne has to go through to get there,
in the end, results in great television.''
   At ``Moonlighting,'' Daniel was credited with settling problems
between the production company and Cybill Shepherd, who starred in
the show with Bruce Willis.
   ``Roseanne'' was in third place in the latest Nielsen ratings
and for the season to date it is in first place.

   Oliver North says the wave of
democratic reform sweeping Eastern Europe should be credited to his
former boss, not the Soviet leader.
   More than 1,000 people collectively paid North's $25,000 fee for
a 75-minute speech Wednesday before the Palm Beach Round Table at
the Palm Hotel.
   North discussed Time magazine's Man of the Decade, Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev: ``I don't trust him, and I don't think you
should trust him.''
   The former White House aide steered away from last month's U.S.
invasion of Panama and his 1989 convictions in the Iran-Contra
scandal, instead heralding the changes in Eastern Europe, which he
credited to former President Ronald Reagan.
   North's pronouncements met with resounding applause from the
crowd, with the exception of one participant in the
question-and-answer period.
   ``How can a convicted felon have the gall to tell us what's good
for the country?'' one woman said. A handful of pickets were
outside the hotel.

   Nixon spoke Thursday to patients at the Miami Project to Cure
Paralysis, founded by former Dolphins linebacker Nick Buoniconti, a

   Buoniconti and his son, Marc, who was left a quadriplegic after
being injured in 1985 during a college football game, were among
those showing Nixon the state-of-the-art treatment facility.
   ``Sometimes all of us feel life's a little tough,'' Nixon said
later. ``We have some problems, disappointments. Whenever you get
discouraged, you should think of these people. ... It's been an
inspiration to me to go through this facility.''
   Nixon heaped accolades on Nick Buoniconti.
   ``He made a difference in the No-Name defense,'' said Nixon, who
was presented with a football autographed by the project's doctors
and scientists. ``He's made a difference now in a much bigger way

   Members of Congress who oversee the defense
budget are giving Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's plan to save
billions of dollars by reforming the Pentagon's purchasing
bureaucracy a skeptical reception.
   ``We'll ultimately find the proof in the Pentagon checkbook,''
Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said Thursday after Cheney updated his plans for
overhauling the massive system.
   Aspin said in a statement that Cheney's defense management
system ``offers no blueprint for implementation.''
   Cheney told reporters he expected billions of dollars to be
saved in the overhaul and 42,000 jobs will be eliminated. But he
acknowledged there is ``no major fix'' for the department's
problems.
   ``This is going to be a continuous process,'' he said. ``This is
the first bite of the apple, if you will.''
   For example, no major departments will be eliminated, and most
of the job cuts are expected to be reached through attrition.
   But Cheney argued that radical reforms were not necessary to
respond to the procurement scandals that resulted in budgets
bloated by overpriced coffee pots, ashtrays and hammers.
   ``The idea that this organization is all fouled up is a totally
fallacious idea,'' he said, saying he wants not simply to cut the
budget, but to obtain ``a more efficient system that can run with
fewer people and greater accountability, and that will result in a
system that costs less to operate.''
   ``Real changes are being made ... that we believe will improve
Pentagon management and help make it possible for us to buy what we
need at lower cost, in less time and with greater assurance of
quality,'' Cheney said.
   The secretary said precise details on how the savings would be
achieved, and where job cuts would come from would await release of
President Bush's fiscal 1991 budget later this month.
   Asked whether there would be additional base closings, Cheney
said the budget will include ``extensive'' closures. When asked to
define ``extensive,'' he quipped, ``more than two.''
   Cheney said ``$600 toilet seats are sexy, and easy to get people
to focus on. The work of getting the Department of Defense to
function in such a way so that we don't have $600 toilet seats is
hard and complex.''
   The reform effort was spurred by weapons-procurement scandals
that rocked the defense establishment in the 1980s. Cheney also has
been eager in the face of congressional budget-cutting pressures to
show he is working to pare the military's fiscal hunger.
   In a letter dated Tuesday, leading members of the House and
Senate Armed Services committees expressed concerns that
``effective implementation ... (of reform) recommendations will be
difficult.''
   ``The Defense Department needs to take these efforts the one
necessary step further and formulate a plan of action to put these
recommendations into practice,'' the lawmakers wrote.
   In his statement, Aspin noted the Congress and administration
agreed on ``an acquisition summit'' to measure the effectiveness of
the reforms and hoped to see progress in savings there.
   In a separate statement, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., warned
against cutting out the ``waste fighters and the whistleblowers.''
   ``It's one thing to reduce the number of players on the bench,
but it's quite another to take the referees out of the game,''
Levin said.
   Weapons purchases account for more than $60 billion of the
department's $305 billion military budget; the management and
logistics work force numbers some 580,000 civilian and military
workers.
   Although reports circulated recently that Cheney's reforms would
include doing away with some duplicative purchasing systems
entrenched in various branches of the military services, the
Pentagon announcement said the savings would be achieved primarily
through:
   _Streamlining each service's purchasing system.
   _Reducing the use of consultants and outside advisers.
   _Creating a full-time acquisition corps in each service that
would report to a ``streamlined chain of command'' to top civilian
department officials.
   _Eliminating unnecessary paperwork.
   According to a statement released to reporters, management
improvements ``will generate $2.3 billion in savings'' in fiscal
1991 and an estimated $39 billion through fiscal 1995.
   ``The improvements make it possible to trim the logistics and
management work force of 580,000 civilians and military personnel
and by as many as 8,000 civilians and 8,000 military personnel in
FY '91 and by 18,000 civilian and 24,000 military personnel by the
end of FY '95,'' the statement said.

   A carpenter who was one of the
first single men in Florida to adopt children pleaded guilty
Thursday to sexually abusing four boys, including three of his
adopted sons.
   David Allen Lindsey Sr., 45, agreed to accept a 15-year prison
sentence under the plea bargain. Palm Beach County Circuit Judge
Thomas Sholts also extended Lindsey's three-year probation on a
separate molestation conviction to 10 years.
   Lindsey declined to comment on the plea deal as he was
fingerprinted in the courtroom, handcuffed and led away to a
courthouse holding cell, but his lawyer, Richard Lubin, said later
that Lindsey maintains he is innocent despite the formal
acknowledgement of guilt.
   ``It was a pragmatic decision that he made,'' Lubin said. ``He
learned at his last trial that whether there's reasonable doubt or
not, you can easily be convicted of child abuse.''
   On Sept. 28, Lindsey was convicted of lewd assault on a
14-year-old boy. He was sentenced Nov. 11 to 5{ years in prison and
three years of probation and forbidden to have contact with
children under age 16.
   David Lindsey Jr., one of 11 boys adopted by Lindsey and his
adopted father's chief accuser, said he was relieved to see the
2{-year legal process end. ``It's been a long-awaited day,'' the
younger Lindsey said, ``and I'm glad it's here and we don't have to
go through a trial.
   ``I think it serves the interests of all of us in the long
run,'' he said of the plea bargain.
   Lindsey faced 17 sex-related charges before Thursday's hearing,
all involving three of his adopted sons and a fourth boy, a friend
of one of the sons.
   Under the plea arrangement, Lindsey pleaded guilty to one charge
each against the four boys, and the remaining 13 charges were
dropped.
   One of those four charges Lindsey pleaded guilty to involved a
boy under 12 and carried a mandatory 25-year sentence. That charge
had been reduced as part of the plea agreement.
   In addition, Lindsey cannot be prosecuted for any illegal sexual
activity occuring before the plea.
   Lindsey's sentence also prohibits any contact with children
under age 16 during his ten years of probation, and includes
psychiatric treatment. Lindsey agreed under the plan to drop his
appeal of the earlier conviction.
   Supporters of the elder Lindsey attending the hearing included
his wife _ whom he married after adopting the boys _ his mother,
his two sisters and four of his other adopted sons, who have backed
him since his arrest in June 1987.
   Single-parent adoptions were a rarity in 1969, when Lindsey
first asked permission to adopt a son. After two years of volunteer
work at an orphanage, he was given his first son.
   By 1981, his family had grown to include five boys, the fifth
being his namesake, David Jr. After a series of quarrels with his
adoptive father in 1987, David. Jr. went to authorities with his
allegations.

<HEAD>Studies Confirm `Great Attractor' Tugging on Milky Way Galaxy</HEAD>

   Like an immense gravitational magnet, a
vast celestial structure nicknamed ``the great attractor'' is
pulling powerfully at the Milky Way and more than 100 other
galaxies, causing a dramatic distortion in the normal expansion of
the nearby universe.
   The structure has been shown in new studies to be pulling on
galaxies from across more than 100 million light years of space,
astronomer Alan Dressler said Thursday at a meeting of the American
Astronomical Society.
   Dressler, with the Carnegie Institution of Washington, said he
and Sandra Faber of the University of California at Santa Cruz have
confirmed the influence of the great attractor by measuring the
movements of about 400 galaxies and comparing that motion with what
is considered normal for an expanding universe.
   More than 100 galaxies were found to have a ``peculiar motion''
that pointed toward the center of what Dressler labeled the great
attractor.
   Current theory is that the universe is expanding at a steady
rate, hence all galaxies are moving in one direction at a constant
rate. Any change in rate or direction is considered ``peculiar
motion.''
   ``The great attractor is a large area of density in which
galaxies are moving toward it from one side and toward it from the
other,'' Dressler said. ``The distortion (in motion) is very marked
and very significant.''
   Dressler said the gravitational pull of the great attractor has
added about 600 kilometers a second, or about 1.3 million miles an
hour, to the motion velocity of the galaxies it is drawing in.
   Dressler, Faber and five other astronomers, called the ``Seven
Samurai'' in the astronomy community, presented preliminary
evidence for the presence of the great attractor in 1987.
   The idea was met then with great skepticism because it went
against theories that matter formed in generally smooth patterns in
the universe.
   ``We had found a rather large lump,'' Dressler said. Their
studies then showed that only galaxies on the same side as the
Milky Way were being drawn toward the attractor.
   Since then, Dressler said, he and Faber have found many
additional star clusters also moving toward the great attractor,
including some moving from beyond the assumed location of the
structure.
   ``There is evidence now that galaxies are falling in from the
other side,'' he said.
   Measurements, he said, have determined that the great attractor
is about 500 million light years across and that the center of the
structure is about 150 million light years away from the Milky Way,
which is the home of the sun and the Earth.
   A light year is the distance in space that light will travel in
one year, about 6 trillion miles.
   Dressler said the structure stretches about 60 degrees across
the Earth's view of the sky, reaching from superclusters of
galaxies known as Hydra and Centaurus, through the plane of the
Milky Way, to the superclusters Pavo and Indus.
   The great attractor is not solid, but rather is an area where
there is a greater than average density of superclusters of
galaxies and the so-called ``dark matter,'' universal material that
cannot be seen, Dressler said. Much of the mass in the universe is
thought by astronomers to be ``dark matter.''
   The new study was presented in a paper at the 175th national
meeting of the AAS.

Guerrillas</HEAD>

   Two elderly Japanese have emerged from 45 years in
the jungle, becoming the most recent of a group of Japanese for
whom World War II stretched on for decades.
   Shigeyuki Hashimoto, now 71, and Kiyoaki Tanaka, 77, were
employees of a Japanese company in Malaysia at the end of the war,
but they joined Communist guerrillas fighting for Malaysia's
independence from Britain, one of Japan's former enemies, rather
than return home.
   The group, the Communist Party of Malaysia, continued its
insurgency after the country became independent in 1957 but
officially laid down its arms Dec. 2 when it signed a peace accord
with Malaysian and Thai officials.
   Hashimoto and Tanaka, who are to return to Tokyo on Saturday,
are unlikely to get the massive hero's welcome given to Japan's
most famous World War II holdouts, Sgt. Shoichi Yokoi and Lt. Hiroo
Onoda, when they emerged in 1972 and 1974 respectively.
   Friends plan welcoming ceremonies for the two, but many Japanese
are uncomfortable with the issues of blind dedication and loyalty
raised by the men's return.
   Wartime Japanese were taught to be loyal to the nation and
emperor, and soldiers were trained to obey a code that said death
was preferable to surrender.
   In interviews televised here, Tanaka and Hashimoto said they
felt a responsibility to stay and help the guerrillas because of
Japan's wartime claim to be saving Asia from European dominance.
   ``We thought Malaysians would think we were taking advantage of
them if we let Britain reclaim their country,'' Hashimoto said.
   Japan's Ministry of Health and Welfare still is estigating the
cases of 48 former Japanese soldiers who could be living in the
vast areas of Asia controlled by Japan during the war.
   The best-known holdout, Onoda, left the Philippine jungle on his
52nd birthday in 1974. An intelligence officer, he received orders
in 1945 to stay behind and spy on the U.S. armed forces. Japan
surrendered in August 1945.
   Onoda refused to give up, despite at least four searches by
Japanese officials in which family members appealed to him over
loudspeakers and leaflets were dropped from airplanes calling on
him to surrender.
   Onoda later said he did not give up because no one had reversed
his order _until his former commander, Maj. Yoshimi Taniguchi,
traveled to the Philippines and ordered him to come out.
   In his formal surrender to then-President Ferdinand Marcos,
broadcast on national Japanese television, Onoda wore his
30-year-old imperial army uniform, cap and sword, all still in good
condition.
   After returning home, Onoda decided he did not have the skills
to live in modern Japanese society and moved to Brazil, where he
danced in discos, got married and lived on a ranch.
   ``I do not consider those 30 years a waste of time,'' he said.
``I was ordered to go there and I carried out the orders to the
best of my ability.''
   A member of Onoda's platoon, Pfc. Shinichi Kozuka, was shot dead
in 1972 after he and Onoda fired on a Philippine Constabulary
patrol on Lubang Island. People there blamed the two for killing at
least 21 people, injuring more than a dozen and burning crops _
apparently in an attempt to aid Japan's war effort.
   Yokoi surfaced in 1972 on Guam, 27 years after plunging into the
jungle, where he tailored his clothes out of tree bark and ate a
diet of shrimp, coconuts, snails, frogs and rats. He called it
``living like a badger in the jungles.''
   Captured by two local fishermen, Yokoi returned to Japan and
made an apparently successful switch to modern life. He got married
and made a living from writing and lecturing.
   In his best-selling memoirs, ``Road to Tomorrow,'' he recounted
that he had thought that leaflets saying the war was over were U.S.
propaganda, and so refused to surrender and give up the rifle that
had been ``entrusted'' to him by the emperor.
   ``It was my belief in the emperor that kept me alive ... kept me
from surrendering and humiliating myself as a prisoner of war,''
Yokoi said.
   The Japanese educational system before and during the war
emphasized ultra-nationalism and allegiance to the emperor, in
whose name soldiers fought. Soldiers were instructed to commit
suicide rather than give themselves up and about 25 of Onoda's and
Kozuka's comrades on Lubang reportedly did so.
   Now the emperor is a figurehead and Japan's constitution forbids
war as an instrument of national policy.
   There have been numerous unconfirmed and false sightings of
former Japanese soldiers in remote jungles.
   Some soldiers have decided to continue their lives away from
Japan. One, Lance Cpl. Chisaburo Bise, said he was content raising
corn and selling banana leaves in a remote village in Thailand,
where he escaped from an Allied prison camp after the war.
   Another, Sakunojo Kitamura, also escaped from a prison camp,
joined the Burmese army in 1949 and after retiring continued to
live in Burma. He visited Japan for the first time in 1985, using
money raised by a veterans' group.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Serious streptococcal infections, including strep
throat and rheumatic fever, have escalated to the point where they
are a re-emerging public health problem, federal health officials
said.
   Group A streptococcus _ the bacteria that cause rheumatic fever,
strep throat and impetigo _ have caused several outbreaks of
disease across the United States, the Centers for Disease Control
said Thursday in its weekly report.
   Among them: an outbreak of streptococcal bacteremia _ a serious,
feverish infection which pervades the bloodstream _ in the Denver,
Colo., area last year.
   Nineteen cases were confirmed in one hospital between January
and August, compared with eight in all of 1988 and three in 1987.
   Some of the Denver cases might have been prevented if doctors
had better treated the original strep infection before it reached
the bloodstream, said Dr. Ben Schwartz, a CDC specialist.
   ``Many of these patients had respiratory infections; others had
skin infections,'' he said. ``It's conceivable that if they had
been treated early, it may not have spread to the severe bacteremia
that occurred.''
   That outbreak followed reports of an outbreak of toxic shocklike
infections in 1987 and clusters of rheumatic fever in 1985 and 1986.
   ``Recently ... streptococcal infections have re-emerged as a
public health problem,'' the Atlanta-based CDC said.
   The CDC also reported an outbreak of strep throat at Texas'
Lackland Air Force Base in December 1988 and January 1989 _ 186
trainees tested positive for strep.
   That outbreak, the CDC said, shows that strep-related disease,
which caused substantial sickness among military recruits in World
Wars I and II, still poses a risk to military training centers.
   ``A number of different, severe strep infections do seem to be
increasing in certain areas,'' Schwartz said. ``We need to gather
similar information from other areas and see if this is a localized
problem or a problem that's more widespread.''
   The CDC has also received reports of streptococcal bacteremia
outbreaks in England and Scandinavia, suggesting ``widespread
changes'' in the pattern of this disease, the agency said.
   Most strep infections are mild, such as the typical case of
strep throat, and most cases can be cleared up with antibiotics
such as penicillin, Schwartz said. ``Very rarely does it spread to
cause an infection in the blood,'' he said.
   Severe strep infections such as bacteremia and scarlet fever
were once much more common than they are today. The decline, in
part, can be attributed to modern antibiotics, the CDC said.
   Streptococcal bacteremia occurs most often among the elderly,
including nursing home residents, the CDC said.
   The Lackland Air Force Base outbreak resulted in precautionary
penicillin treatments for each of the more than 6,000 trainees
there _ the first such program in more than 15 years at that base.

<HEAD>Reagan Forgives, Prays for Hinckley</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan says he forgives
would-be assassin John Hinckley and prays that ``he should have
some healing for himself,''
   ``I found out he wasn't thinking on all cylinders,'' Reagan said
of Hinckley Thursday night during an interview on CNN's ``Larry
King Live.''
   During the hour-long interview, done in Los Angeles and
monitored in Washington, Reagan also said he thinks Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev would make a successful U.S.
politician and said he likes convicted former aide Oliver North,
although he wouldn't discuss the Iran-Contra scandal in detail.
   Asked whether he forgives Hinckley, who was found innocent by
reason of insanity of trying to assassinate the president in March
1981, Reagan said, ``Yes.''
   ``I added him to my prayers that, well, if I wanted healing for
myself and maybe he should have some healing for himself,'' Reagan
said.
   Hinckley wrote a letter published in The Washington Post in 1984
in which he asked that Reagan ``forgive me for my past madness.''
   The former president had little to say about North, a
now-retired Marine lieutenant colonel Reagan fired as a National
Security Council aide over his role in the Iran-Contra affair.
North is appealing his felony conviction for falsifying government
documents and on other charges arising from the affair.
   ``Well, I had difficulty in talking about this situation that he
was directly involved in because it is still before the law and all
and I could create some problems if I made statements,'' Reagan
said.
   But asked if he personally liked North, Reagan said: ``Yes, and
he had a great military record of courage and certainly of taking
care of the men.''
   Reagan said he also liked Gorbachev but did not let that affect
his bargaining position. ``I have to say I think that there was a
kind of a chemistry,'' Reagan said.
   Asked if he thought Gorbachev could be a successful politician
in the United States, Reagan answered, ``Yes, because I think he is
a likable person. You find yourself liking him.''
   Reagan, a movie and television actor before he turned to
politics, said he does not plan to return to his former craft.
   ``I happen to believe that returning to that now would seem as
if I was trying to capitalize on the presidency,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, that complaint was made about Reagan after he and
his wife Nancy accepted a $2 million fee for a trip to Japan last
year.
   Reagan said he earned the money, that he didn't ask for it and
that other people got paid more for doing less.
   ``We were there for nine days and Nancy managed to set up an
anti-drug program as she has in this country,'' he said. ``I felt
that in going to Japan I would help in bringing about a closer
relationship.''

<HEAD>U.S. Sending Envoy to Examine Guerilla Stalemate in Afghanistan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The State Department is sending an envoy to
take a ``fresh look'' at the problems of the U.S.-armed Mujahedeen
guerrillas fighting the Soviet-backed government of Afghanistan.
   Undersecretary of State Robert Kimmitt is leaving Saturday for a
week-long trip to Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and India, the State
Department said Thursday. He is taking along the administration's
special Afghanistan coordinator, Peter Tomsen.
   ``We're taking a fresh look,'' said one U.S. official, in light
of the stalemate in fighting between the Mujahedeen and government
forces since Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan Feb. 15.
   ``Policy must always reflect changing circumstances,'' said the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Kimmitt, the No. 3 official at the State Department, is
scheduled to meet with Pakistani officials and with the heads of an
Afghan coalition that includes the seven major rebel groups.
   In a covert program funded by Congress, the United States
funnels about $600 million worth of weapons through Pakistan to the
Mujahedeen and the Pakistani secret service distributes the arms.
   Saudi Arabia has also been a major contributor to the
Mujahedeen, and Kimmitt is expected to discuss with Saudi officials
the rebels' changed circumstances, a U.S. official said.
   The United States has grown increasingly concerned with the
Mujahedeen's failure to rout the Soviet-installed government of
President Najibullah, contrary to American predictions of victory
following the Soviets' pullout.
   The Kabul government has also not succeeded in capturing the
countryside from the Mujahedeen, although it has held onto the
major cities with the help of what U.S. officials claim are massive
infusions of Soviet arms.
   The Afghan standoff is expected to come up in talks next month
in Moscow between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   ``I'm glad the Bush administration is reassessing our effort,''
said Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., a strong ally of the Mujahedeen.
``Our policy has been on auto-pilot since the end of the Reagan
administration.''
   Humphrey said new training and a different mix of weapons are
called for in light of the military stalemate.
   The United States should also demand that the Pakistani secret
service stop playing the different Afghan groups off against each
other and provide ``an equitable distribution'' of weapons,
Humphrey said.
   ``There's a lot of dissatisfaction in the Senate because we're
not getting much for our money,'' he said. Next time Congress is
asked to approve aid for the Mujahedeen, ``I'm going to insist that
conditions are attached, no more carte blanche.''
   Humphrey said he would insist the CIA bring in Defense
Department experts to help retrain and support the Mujahedeen.

<HEAD>Burger Aligns Himself With Gun-Control Advocates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gun control advocates have a new ally in
retired Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, a man who has owned
sporting guns all his life and once made news by answering his door
armed with a pistol.
   In an article to be published by Parade magazine Sunday, Burger
called for steps to halt the growing number of handgun murders in
America _ 9,000 last year alone.
   ``To keep and bear arms for hunting today is essentially a
recreational activity and not an imperative of survival as it was
200 years ago,'' Burger said.
   ``Saturday night specials and machine guns are not recreational
weapons and surely are as much in need of regulation as motor
vehicles.''
   Burger said tighter restrictions on buying and selling guns
should be considered ``if we are to stop this mindless homicidal
carnage.'' A constitutional right to bear arms, he said, should not
be interpreted to block all gun regulation.
   He proposed requiring gun buyers to fill out an application that
would include any prior criminal convictions and a 10-day waiting
period before a gun license is issued.
   Burger also suggested stricter registration and record-keeping,
such as are required when cars are sold and said it might be
reasonable to require manufacturers to provide authorities with ``a
ballistic fingerprint'' for each gun they make to help police
locate murder weapons.
   While he has owned sporting guns all his life, Burger said he
has done little hunting in recent years. He posed for the Parade
magazine cover with an antique rifle.
   Sixteen years ago, Burger's ownership of a pistol made news when
the armed chief justice confronted a newspaper reporter who had
gone to Burger's home late one night seeking comment.
   Burger retired from the Supreme Court in 1986 when he left to
become chairman of the Commission on the Bicentennial of the United
States Constitution, a position he still holds.
   He said the right to bear arms, spelled out in the
Constitution's Second Amendment, should be understood in context.
   It was approved by the same First Congress that limited the
national army to 840 men and provided that each state maintain its
own militia, Burger said. The founding fathers were concerned
mainly with protecting individuals against abuses by a national
army, he said.
   The right to defend one's home or to own a hunting rifle will
not be impaired by stricter gun controls, Burger said. In some
places, he noted, even bicycles and household dogs must be
registered.

<TEXT>
   After a year on the job, James A. Baker III is
as hard to figure out as the impact of his foreign policy.
   Correction: Make that George Bush's foreign policy.
   Difficult as it may be to isolate Baker's views, his commitment
to his friend, the president, is total.
   Baker is Bush's man at the State Department, not the State
Department's representative to the White House.
   He avoids the limelight and has few news conferences. He's a
good bet to pop up as a Sunday television talk show guest and just
as good a bet not to make news.
   That's not unusual for a Secretary of State. Even those who come
from the heated political arena learn to speak a strange tongue
that reveals virtually nothing about their policies beyond the
broad outlines.
   There is something to be said for quiet diplomacy.
   The Camp David agreement President Carter worked out between
Egypt and Israel in 1978 was accomplished during a news blackout of
nearly two weeks.
   It produced frustrated journalists, but also a landmark peace
treaty in 1979 between the two warring Middle Eastern nations.
   Still, Baker is an extreme case.
   He prefers talking to reporters off the record, which under
Washington rules means he can't be quoted by name or even
identified as a ``senior official.'' He says a little more in that
protective mode, but not much.
   Considering his job and good connections to the president,
Baker's influence is assumed to be large. But he keeps his head
down, makes few speeches and doesn't leave fingerprints.
   He was nearly invisible during the long siege in Panama. His
work in the Middle East is mostly on the telephone. Baker showed a
little irritation this week with the demands Arabs and Israelis are
registering as a precondition to negotiations.
   And yet, the flash of irritation may have been calculated _
designed to pressure the parties to give in. Or Baker may have
momentarily dropped his mask. It's impossible to know.
   As a political strategist who helped engineer Bush's climb to
the White House, Baker was not known to be error-prone.
   He stumbled a little at the start at State, keeping stock in a
Texas bank that had an indirect stake in Third World debt policy.
But once his holdings became public knowledge, he sold the stock
and everything else in his portfolio to avoid any conflict of
interest.
   Also, Baker fibbed a bit by saying on television that the trip
Brent Scowcroft and Lawrence Eagleburger made to Beijing last month
was their first since the June massacre in Tiananmen Square.
   Baker knew the national security adviser and deputy Secretary of
State had also met with Chinese leaders in Beijing in early July.
   Caught in the misstatement, Baker apologized and said he was
simply trying to support the president's secret diplomacy.
   ``I do not think Jim Baker would ever deliberately mislead
somebody,'' Bush said, ``and so I will stand with him.''
   From the little Baker has said about various foreign policy
issues, and judging also by body language, he almost certainly is a
force for moderation in U.S. foreign policy.
   For example, he scuttled a key plank in President Reagan's
Central American policy by refusing to seek renewed military aid
for the Contra rebels in Nicaragua and forged a bipartisan approach
with Congress.
   His view of Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the Soviet Union seems to
have grown more nuanced.
   Initially, Baker and his closest advisers found more in the
nature of public relations and pragmatic tactics in the Soviet
president's quiver.
   But as he listened and looked closer, Baker overcame the doubts
of hardliners in the Bush administration and grew committed to what
Gorbachev is trying to accomplish in the Soviet Union.
   Baker appears to be working as comfortably with Eduard
Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister, as did his predecessor,
George Shultz.
   Shevardnadze's frank account to Baker of the Soviet Union's
economic plight on a long flight to Jackson, Wyo., in September had
a strong impact on the former Treasury Secretary.
   They will meet again in Moscow next month, and probably twice
more before Bush and Gorbachev hold a Washington summit in June.
   They are trying to help U.S. and Soviet negotiators in Geneva
wrap up a treaty to reduce long-range nuclear missiles on both
sides by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   Baker and his close circle of advisers also were instrumental in
framing Bush's proposal to cut U.S. and Soviet ground forces and
non-nuclear arms in Europe.
   The outlook for a treaty in that area is reasonably bright.
   Baker, meanwhile, is giving more emphasis to the political
situation in Europe.
   His most important speech as Secretary of State was an address
to the Berlin Press Club last month in which he urged the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization to reflect the lowering of tensions in
Europe by developing ``a new architecture for a new era.''
   The United States would maintain strong ties with the West
Europeans while NATO took on a broader role that included
monitoring troop reductions and mediating regional disputes.
   ``As Europe changes, the instruments for Western cooperation
must adapt,'' Baker said.
   The same day, Baker ventured into East Germany to show U.S.
support for a struggling reformist regime.
   It was a surprising gesture, and contributed to Baker's mixture
of hope and concern about developments in Eastern and Central
Europe.
   Naturally, he is pleased with the trend toward democracy. But
he's also apprehensive of the violence and retribution that have
surfaced at times.

<HEAD>Angolan Capital Tense After Rebels Attack Beach Resort</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S.-backed UNITA rebels attacked a
popular beach resort earlier this week and 80 people were killed,
according to news reports.
   The reports Thursday said the rebels from UNITA _ the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ attacked the resort of
Cabo Ledo, 62 miles douth of the capital, on Monday night. They
held the town for several hours before retreating ahead of a
government advance backed by tanks, helicopters and Cuban troops,
according to the reports.
   The TPA state television network showed burning buildings and
cited witnesses saying the fighting killed and wounded many people.
An unofficial estimate said 80 people died.
   Cabo Ledo is a resort famed for beaches and seafood restaurants.
It is a favorite weekend retreat for Luanda-based diplomats and
representatives of western companies.
   The reports said about 100 guerrillas were involved in the
attack, concentrating their fire on the small army base in Cabo
Ledo and work sites of a company reparing the road from Luanda to
Porto Amboim, 143 miles south of the capital.
   News of the Cabo Ledo fighting shocked residents of Luanda.
Government officials were reported worried at the rebels' capacity
to strike so close to the capital.
   News of the Cabo Ledo attack followed a bomb blast Tuesday that
injured three people in downtown Luanda. The bomb damaged the
criminal records office and exploded close to other government
buildings.
   Meanwhile, military sources in the capital said government
forces were intensifying an offensive against UNITA strongholds in
southeast Angola.
   The sources said government troops had temporarily halted the
offensive before the stategic rebel base of Mavinga 687 miles
southeast of the capital, but were flying more troops and equipment
to the southeast.
   A statement distributed by the rebels in Lisbon, Portugal,
Thursday claimed 63 government soldiers and 13 rebels died between
Monday and Wednesday in the southeast.
   UNITA has been fighting to share power since a Marxist
government took power in Luanda when Angola gained independence
from Portugal in 1975.
   Efforts to end the 15-year-old civil war have floundered since a
truce last June broke down within weeks.
   Under a Dec. 1988 accord, Cuban troops aiding the government
have pulled out of southern Angola and begun withdrawing from the
country.
   The national news agency ANGOP reported Thursday that 31,000
Cuban troops out of an estimated 50,000 total have left.
   Under the 1988 accord, South Africa agreed to halt aid to UNITA
and grant independence to Angola's southern neighbor, Namibia.

<HEAD>Kemp Trying to Reshape HUD Financial Management</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp is moving ahead with
plans to reshape his department's financial management to ``remove
the poison from the system.''
   Kemp said a team of leading accounting professionals would
search for the most qualified person to manage the billions of
dollars spent each year by the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
   The non-partisan panel also will recommend candidates to serve
as comptrollers in the department's five major divisions: Housing,
Community Development and Planning, Public and Indian Housing,
Government National Mortgage Association and Administration.
   All six of the new officials will be required to be certified
public accountants, Kemp said
   When they are in place and strict systems of financial
accountability are in operation, Kemp said he would insist on an
inflexible standard of ``zero tolerance for ethical lapses.''
   ``I think that is a realistic goal if we are meticulous in
seeking the very highest caliber of people to create HUD's
financial systems for the 1990s,'' Kemp said.
   He said he hoped the system will serve as a model for
departments and agencies throughout the government.
   Kemp made his announcement at a luncheon meeting Thursday of the
Association of Government Accountants.
   ``HUD's new chief financial officer and comptrollers will put
our financial house in order,'' he said. ``They will install
effective financial management for HUD guided by the overriding
requirements of integrity, professional competence and
accountability.
   ``I am totally confident that by placing responsibility for
rebuilding HUD's financial management in the hands of individuals
of integrity we can guarantee that the day of abuse, fraud, waste
and lack of accountability is over. Our goal is to remove the
poison from the system.''
   Kemp said that when he took over the department a year ago from
Secretary Samuel Pierce, HUD had only one actuary to monitor its
$300 billion insurance program, had 77 separate financial
management systems, none of which met official standards, and had
not been audited by outside auditors in 15 years.
   He declined to criticize Pierce by name.
   Kemp began the search for new financial officers under the
authority of legislation, signed into law last month, which is
intended to improve program management and financial accountability
at HUD.
   The legislation grew out of revelations of fraud, influence
peddling and political favoritism at HUD during the Reagan
administration.
   The multibillion scandal has been the subject of congressional
and criminal investigations.

<HEAD>Winter Wheat Plantings Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers have boosted winter wheat plantings
for this year's harvest, but analysts say poor conditions have
raised concerns that reduced yields could mean an even tighter
supply down the line.
   An Agriculture Department report said Thursday that farmers
planted nearly 57 million acres of winter wheat last fall for
harvest in 1990, a 3 percent increase from 1989 and the most
acreage in five years.
   But the increase was much less than the 6 percent to 8 percent
that some analysts had been predicting. Thus, said one, there will
be a thinner cushion against possible poor yields this summer.
   ``This would be the largest wheat area since the 1985 crop''
when plantings totaled 57.8 million acres, the department's
Agricultural Statistics Board said.
   ``Lack of moisture stressed winter wheat in the central and
southern Great Plains during December,'' the report said. ``In
mid-to-late December, cold weather stressed winter wheat in the
southern Great Plains, Delta and Southeast.''
   More recently, much of the protective snow cover in vast areas
of the Plains has melted, raising concerns about damage from
subsequent cold weather.
   Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the next year.
It accounts for about three-fourths of the total U.S. wheat output.
   Last year's winter wheat production declined because of
lingering drought in some major production areas, but total wheat
output increased because of a boost in spring-planted areas.
   Meanwhile, U.S. wheat stockpiles have continued to shrink,
keeping market prices high.
   To help replenish dwindling reserves, the department is
requiring farmers to idle only 5 percent of their wheat base acres
this year, compared with a 10 percent set-aside in 1989 and 27.5
percent previously.
   In another option intended to boost production, wheat farmers
are permitted to plant up to 10 percent more acreage than otherwise
would be permitted under the 1990 program.
   As originally announced May 31, farmers were to plant no more
than 95 percent of their wheat land. But the option announced Sept.
13 lets them plant up to 105 percent, or 10 percent more than
otherwise would be permitted under the basic program.
   Economist John Schnittker, a Washington-based consultant, said
that larger plantings would have provided a better cushion for
possible yield losses later in the season.
   For example, he said, if plantings had been boosted 6 percent to
8 percent as many had expected, that would have helped offset any
major impact from reduced yields caused by poor growing conditions.
   But with only a 3 percent increase in 1990 plantings, that
cushion is thinner and ``leaves very little margin for reduced
yields,'' Schnittker said in a telephone interview. ``We're at
greater risk than expected.''
   The report showed that wheat farmers in Kansas, traditionally
the biggest producer, kept plantings at last year's level _ 12.4
million acres. Increases were reported in Missouri and Montana,
Oklahoma, South Dakota and Washington.
   But Nebraska farmers reduced winter wheat plantings by 2
percent, and Texas producers cut theirs by 3 percent.
   In a supply-and-demand analysis, officials said the U.S. total
wheat stockpile June 1, the beginning of the 1990-91 wheat
marketing year, could be reduced to 468 million bushels from 702
million June 1 and 1.26 billion bushels two years ago.
   However, the new June 1 forecast was up 25 million bushels from
indications in December. No projections were included for 1990-91.
   Export demand has been fed by U.S. price subsidies for a number
of countries, including the Soviet Union and China. Even so, total
wheat exports in 1989-90 are expected to drop to around 1.275
billion bushels, down from 1.419 billion last season.
   Domestic requirements are slightly more than 1 billion bushels
for 1989-90, the report said.
   The analysis said average market prices may average in the range
of $3.80 to $3.90 per bushel over the 12-month marketing year, 5
cents to 10 cents less than the December projection. Wheat prices
averaged $3.72 in 1988-89 and $2.57 in 1987-88.
   Another report showed the Dec. 1 inventory of all U.S. wheat at
1.42 billion bushels, down 17 percent from a year earlier. Farm
holdings at 582 million bushels, were down 6 percent from Dec. 1,
1988, while off-farm stocks at 836 million were down 24 percent.
   The Dec. 1 corn stockpile was estimated at 7.08 billion bushels,
virtually the same as a year earlier. Farm inventories were
reported at 4.7 billion bushels, up 10 percent, while off-farm
holdings dropped 15 percent to 2.38 billion bushels.
   Soybean stocks were reported at 1.61 billion bushels, up 18
percent from a year earlier. Farm inventories, at 793 million
bushels, were up 22 percent, and off-farm stocks rose 14 percent to
817 million.
   A review of 1989 crop production relatively minor adjustments in
USDA's previously announced harvest figures.
   The 1989 wheat crop was reported at 2.04 billion bushels, up 12
percent from 1988; corn, 7.53 billion bushels, up 53 percent;
sorghum, 618 million bushels, up 7 percent; oats, 371 million
bushels, up 72 percent; barley, 403 million bushels, up 39 percent.

<HEAD>Groups Say Many Could Pay Dearly for New Phone Technology</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers and government policy makers should
not be swayed by the phone companies' siren song that, if only
given the chance, they could give all Americans telephone, video
and computer data in one neat package, a new report says.
   Those with low incomes, along with the disabled, elderly and the
rural, should be especially wary about a new ``information age,''
because these groups will be the least able to foot the bill,
according to a report prepared for the Consumer Federation of
America and the American Association for Retired Persons.
   The report says rapid integration of voice, video and data under
a ``centralized'' phone network would add $250 billion in
unnecessary expense _ or about $5 a month for each telephone
subscriber for 33 years.
   ``If these inflated costs are passed along to basic phone
customers, affordable phone service could be jeopardized,'' John
Rother, an AARP executive, said Thursday.
   The groups said the nation should move cautiously to the
information age and maintain the current ``decentralized'' system
in which the phone companies serve as conduits for phone and
computer services to individually owned personal computers, rather
than using large central computers. Video should come into the home
on a separate line, the groups said.
   A Bell Atlantic official said the groups were taking an
``either-or'' position that was not called for.
   ``Rather than gamble on computers alone, we want to increase the
odds that all Americans will have affordable access to information
services,'' said A. Gray Collins Jr., Bell Atlantic's executive
vice president for external affairs. ``The answer lies in network
intelligence _ in linking together phones and computers and
everything in between.''
   The regional Bell telephone companies are trying to persuade
Congress to ``jump start'' new technology by freeing them from the
restrictions of a consent decree that broke up the old Bell system
and from strictures in the 1984 Cable Act that prevent them from
owning cable TV systems.
   Local phone companies are barred from owning information
services, providing long-distance service or manufacturing
equipment, and Congress is expected to consider removing some of
those restrictions this year.
   The phone companies want to rewire the nation with high-capacity
fiber-optic lines that could provide video, telephone and data
services all on hair-thin strands of glass.
   They say the United States is falling behind in providing
services such as the home shopping, banking and reservation
services that are offered by networks such as France's
government-subsidized Minitel system.
   A central network, the phone companies argue, could introduce
these new services quickly and efficiently.
   But the report's author, Mark Cooper of the Citizens Research
public interest group, said the low-income, disabled, rural,
elderly and educational institutions could face a heavy financial
burden if phone companies became the central providers of the
services.
   Gene Kimmelman, legislative director of the consumer federation,
said ``it is quite clear the U.S. is not falling behind other
nations'' in information services. ``Information age infrastructure
development is right on schedule and offers consumers a wealth of
services which will expand in the 1990s,'' he said.
   Kimmelman said if present regulation is maintained through this
decade ``the real price of basic telephone service and cable TV can
be substantially reduced and new technologies and desirable
information-age services introduced'' without spending hundreds of
billions of dollars on a network that many consumers don't want or
need.

   It copies, it collates and to the dismay of a
Capitol Hill office, it was the main course for a hardy, foot-long
rat.
   The staff at the office of the House Legislative Counsel viewed
their sophisticated, $93,000 copying machine as the best ever until
a rodent, elusive to most exterminating efforts, made the machine
his home and restaurant.
   ``He was obviously a smart rat,'' office administrator Lynne
Richardson said Thursday.
   While the staff was away, the rat would play, roaming the office
for leftover food, overturning plants and building a nest inside
the Xerox copier, but far from its moving parts.
   The repairman who came to fix the machine when it jammed just
before adjournment found a nest of shredded paper surrounded by
banana peels, corn cobs, rat droppings and a sealed bag with a
Hostess Twinkie inside.
   He also found that the rodent feasted on the copier's computer
wires but smartly avoided the machine's electrical wires that might
have left the staff smelling a rat.
   Xerox deemed the machine a total loss and impossible to repair,
Richardson said. Efforts to revive the copier were complicated by
the type of wiring, which relied on numbering rather than
color-coding.
   The rodent, nicknamed ``Willard'' by the staff and adopted as an
official mascot, chewed through both the wires and the numbers.
   The end result was a $107,000 replacement for the nearly
3-year-old copier.
   ``It was the best machine we ever had,'' Richardson said of the
lost copier.
   The rat saga was first reported Thursday by Roll Call, a
newspaper that focuses on Capitol Hill news.
   Previous exterminating efforts to rid the office of the furry
visitor included stuffing wall openings for pipes with steel wool,
setting traps with peanut butter and spreading poison powder in
some areas.
   But it wasn't until about two weeks ago that the staff received
encouraging news from Bob Miley, superintendent of the House Office
Buildings, who said three rats had been caught and one was
suspected to be the office's rodent, according to Richardson.
   The office administrator, however, has her doubts.
   ``I'm not entirely convinced. I'm really watching for
evidence,'' she said.

   The FBI settled a pair of complaints by black
agents who said the agency discriminated against them when they
worked in its Chicago and Omaha offices, private attorneys said.
   The settlement gives weight to allegations by a third black
agent, Donald Rochon, who is suing the FBI for alleged racial
discrimination when he worked in those two offices, his attorney
said.
   ``It does confirm that Donald Rochon wasn't the only black who
was harassed and discriminated against by whites in these same two
offices,'' attorney David Kairys said on Thursday.
   Attorneys for Leadell Lee, an agent assigned to the Chicago
field office, and Gertie Armstrong, a clerk in Omaha, said they
reached separate settlements of the complaints last summer.
   Kairys said he plans to call both Ms. Armstrong and Lee as
witnesses if Rochon's case goes to trial. Both could provide
evidence of a pattern of racial harassment that existed in the
Omaha and Chicago field offices, he said.
   Rochon's lawsuit suit in federal court in Washington claims he
was the butt of racial jokes and death threats when he was assigned
to the Chicago field office.
   His claims of harassment in Omaha were upheld in administrative
proceedings and are not part of the lawsuit in federal court in
Washington.
   The lawsuit accuses FBI supervisors of tolerating racial
harassment against Rochon and his family and retaliating against
him for complaining. Rochon is now assigned to the Philadelphia
field office.
   The FBI declined to comment about the settlements. Spokesman
Greg Jones confirmed there were two settlements but would not give
further details, saying bureau policy prohibited disclosure of even
the names of the complainants.
   The settlement last July of Lee's complaint resulted in the
dismissal of his civil rights lawsuit filed in federal court in
Chicago, said the agent's attorney, Patricia Motto.
   Lee, who is now assigned to a suburban Los Angeles FBI office,
claimed that he was denied promotions because he was black. The
lawsuit also claimed that he was the victim of racial pranks.
   Lee testified in a pre-trial deposition that fellow agents
posted on the office's bulletin board a picture of a fat black man
wearing underwear and smoking a cigar.
   Beneath the picture, someone had placed the caption: ``Lee
finally gets his promotion to supervisor in Watts,'' a reference to
the black ghetto in Los Angeles, Ms. Motto said.
   On another occasion, he received a typewritten letter entitled
``Twenty Thousand Niggers in Heaven.''
   Ms. Motto said that her client reached the settlement without
receiving a promotion. She declined to say if Lee was given a
monetary settlement.
   ``All I can say is the matter was resolved satisfactorily,'' she
said.
   Rochon and Lee worked together in the Chicago field office at
the same time for a brief period but were assigned to different
squads, Ms. Motto said.
   The Omaha case involves a black FBI clerk who twice complained
to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission about racial
discrimination that resulted in her being fired twice.
   Following her first dismissal, the EEOC ordered Ms. Armstrong's
reinstatement with back pay, after finding she was the victim of
racial discrimination, said Omaha attorney Clyde Christian.
   After her return to the Omaha field office, the racial
harassment resumed, Christian said.
   Ms. Lee complained, was dismissed again, and filed a second EEOC
complaint, which was settled last August, he said.
   Under the settlement, Ms. Armstrong was rehired ``with all
benefits lost'' and transferred to the Cincinnati field office,
Christian said.
   Christian said the FBI's willingness to settle reflected a
determination by FBI Director William Sessions ``to get the
department a new image.''
   Christian said the bureau's lawyers had been taking a hard-line
position on the case but ``things started to change change in early
1989.
   The settlements occurred shortly before Sessions disclosed that
the FBI would not appeal a sweeping court order to end what a
federal judge in Texas found to be sweeping discrimination against
Hispanic agents.
   In that case, U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton III of Midland,
Texas, ordered an overhaul of promotion practices to ensure that
Hispanics receive consideration for supervisory jobs.
   Since he took office in late 1987, Sessions has reviewed bureau
hiring and promotion policies. Last year he hired an equal
employment opportunity manager whom he says reports directly to him.

<HEAD>Arizona Senator's Ad Selective in Use of Testimony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini's new television
commercial makes brief use of a former banking regulator's
testimony that senators did not influence the Lincoln Savings and
Loan case.
   But the ad leaves out the rest of the regulator's testimony,
including his contention that DeConcini offered a ``quid pro quo''
on behalf of the failing thrift and was made ``gullible'' by the
bank owner's campaign money.
   Most of the five-minute commercial is a direct appeal to
constituents from the Arizona Democrat, one of five senators under
scrutiny by the Senate ethics committee for intervening with
regulators in the massive thrift failure.
   ``I have every confidence in your sense of justice,'' DeConcini
tells viewers, explaining he intervened with regulators because he
believed Lincoln's owner, Charles H. Keating Jr., was being
harassed by the ``Washington bureaucracy.''
   Keating, DeConcini points out in the commercial, was not only
Lincoln's owner but head of a firm (American Continental Corp.)
that ``employed 2,000 Arizona people.''
   For a brief moment, the commercial moves from DeConcini to the
House Banking Committee hearing last November and the testimony of
Edwin J. Gray, formerly the nation's top thrift regulator as
chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   DeConcini spokesman Bob Maynes said it was proper that the
commercial shows only the portion of Gray's testimony that favored
the senator and not the assertion that DeConcini tried to assert
his influence.
   ``People know that Gray was critical'' of DeConcini at the same
hearing, Maynes said. ``That's not the problem. What people don't
know is that under oath, Gray had to admit the senators had no
impact on the regulation of Lincoln.
   ``It's perfectly obvious that he (Gray) didn't want to, but had
to admit that. We picked Gray purposefully because he had been the
most critical.''
   DeConcini and Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., and John Glenn, D-Ohio, met with Gray in DeConcini's
office April 2, 1987, after Keating complained banking regulators
were harassing Lincoln.
   A week later, those senators and Banking Committee Chairman
Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., met at Gray's request with regional
bank board officials from San Francisco who were examining Lincoln.
   Keating or his associates donated $1.3 million to the five
senators' campaigns and causes, $48,000 of it to DeConcini.
   ``Many of you may not know, however, that I gave the money back
out of my personal funds,'' DeConcini told viewers. Several
colleagues also returned Keating's contributions, in each case
after the money became the subject of critical news stories.
   In portions of Gray's testimony not shown, the former regulator
said he was asked by DeConcini at the April 2 meeting to drop a
rule barring risky investments by Lincoln.
   ``Do you believe that Sen. DeConcini was offering you a deal
that if you withdrew the direct investment rule, Keating would make
more home mortgages?'' Rep. Chalmers P. Wylie, R-Ohio, asked Gray.
   Gray said, ``Yes sir. That is exactly what he said.''
   At another point Gray testified, ``It sounded like a quid pro
quo. It was a quid pro quo.''
   Gray also testified, ``The receipt of very substantial gifts
from Charles Keating and his associates had long since put them in
the right frame of mind to ... embrace the notion that there was
somehow a vendetta against Lincoln'' by regulators.
   ``When enough money flows, it's apparently easier to be
gullible.''
   The portion of the Nov. 7, 1989, banking committee hearing in
the commercial shows Rep. Stephen L. Neal, D-N.C. asking Gray:
   ``Did the Federal Home Loan Bank Board ever take any action
based on the comments or this intervention on the part of the
senators?''
   Gray: No.
   Neal: ``How can you blame these senators for $2.8 billion worth
of damage if the Federal Home Loan Bank Board never took any action
based on anything they did?''
   Gray did not respond. The figure referred to some estimates of
the taxpayers' cost of protecting Lincoln depositors.
   The commercial is airing on 10 television stations in Phoenix,
Yuma and Tuscon, according to the political consultant who prepared
it, Raymond D. Strother, of Washington. A newspaper advertisement
with a similar message will be published Sunday.

   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd
Bentsen will conduct trade talks with Soviet officials in Moscow
next week, his office says.
   Bentsen, D-Texas, whose committee has jurisdiction over
international trade matters in the Senate, was invited to the
Soviet Union by government officials there.
   Under current law, a U.S. trade agreement with the Soviet Union
would come before the Finance Committee for approval, according to
Bentsen's office.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told Bentsen's committee
at a hearing last fall that the United States could see
restrictions on Soviet trade lifted within the year, if Moscow
writes its new emigration policy into law.
   ``I think it is important that we actively explore increased
commercial relations as one way to encourage this (improvements in
emigration law),'' Bentsen said.
   ``We must also ensure that our trade relationship with the
Soviet Union makes economic sense _ that any trade agreement
provides us as good a deal as the European Community recently got
from the Soviets,'' Bentsen said.
   Bentsen said the United States needs assurances that U.S. firms
would have access to Soviet consumers.

authorities.
   A new federal mutual association was created to acquire all
deposits and certain assets and liabilities of the Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
savings and loan, which was one of six thrifts seized Thursday,
bringing the total under federal control to 290.
   Atlantic Financial will continue to maintain normal business
hours while the Resolution Trust Corp. negotiates a permanent

failed thrifts.
   Atlantic Financial had about $5.8 billion in assets and $3.7
billion in 411,780 deposit accounts, according to the RTC. Deposits
continue to be federally insured.
   The other thrifts seized on Thursday were: St. Charles Savings

   The air-driven artificial heart failed as a
permanent device but, scientists report, work continues on a new
generation of plastic hearts that would let patients live
independent of external machines.
   Some researchers say the Food and Drug Administration's
withdrawal of approval for the Jarvik-7 device might hurt their
work by creating doubt about the long-term feasibility of
artificial hearts.
   They agree that the future of artificial hearts lies in totally
transplantable devices, such as battery-run devices that also could
use external energy sources.
   Some day, a patient's plastic heart may beat from current
flowing from his car's cigarette lighter, says Dr. Donald Olsen, a
University of Utah researcher developing the Utah-100 hydraulic
heart.
   ``The air-drive heart has failed as a permanent device,'' said
Dr. William Pierce of the Penn State Medical Center in Hershey.
   Pierce implanted Penn State's first total artificial heart, like
the Jarvik-7 a pneumatic device, in 1985. But the risk of strokes
and infection facing recipients of the air-driven heart _ who
remain mostly bedridden in hospitals, linked by tubes to large
compressors _ has sapped early hopes for the device.
   ``It's more than what people want to accept,'' Pierce said
Thursday.
   Recipients of the electric heart, who will wear a battery pack,
will be able to walk, exercise and even work, he said.
   The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute is financing
research at Penn State, the University of Utah, the Texas Heart
Institute and the Cleveland Clinic on electric artificial hearts.
   Gerson Rosenberg, a biomedical engineer who leads Penn State's
electric heart development, said the school is in the third year of
its 5{-year contract from the NHLBI and is testing the device in
calves.
   Penn State's air-driven device now is the only FDA-approved
total heart.
   Rosenberg predicted the FDA will consider a totally implantable,
electric heart by the late 1990s.
   Pierce and Rosenberg said they doubt the decision to pull the
Jarvik heart from the marketplace will hinder research because the
FDA's comments focused on Symbion Inc. of Temple, Ariz., which was
producing the heart as the Symbion-7.
   ``It's regrettable that the Symbion company didn't improve that
device,'' Rosenberg said. ``You shouldn't judge all artificial
hearts by the Jarvik. There was an awful lot learned.''
   The Jarvik had been criticized because recipients often
experienced blood clots and strokes. Some researchers claimed the
problems arose because of design problems in the sacs that pump the
blood; other criticism centered on the tube running to the air
compressor.
   The Penn State total heart has been approved only for temporary
use. Other companies produce assist devices, which aid the heart's
function.
   At the University of Utah, where the Jarvik-7 was developed,
researchers have moved on to study a new generation of heart
replacement devices _ known as the Utah-100, primarily for
temporary use _ as a bridge to human heart transplant.
   Olsen said two models of the Utah-100 are being used in animal
experiments. One is air-driven, requiring external heart drive
hoses; the other, a hydraulically driven version, is fully
contained within the recipient's chest.
   The hydraulic model has generated the most enthusiasm and enjoys
a five-year, $5.6 million National Institutes of Health grant.
Olsen said the NIH has set a goal of having a totally implantable
artifical heart by 1995.
   The Utah-100 is elliptically shaped and smaller than the
Symbion-7. Its design includes an internal battery and a system of
electrical induction coils located under and above the skin of the
chest.
   The coil on the outside could be connected to a variety of power
sources, including a battery pack, a transformer tapping into
residential power, and possibly a device allowing the patient to
draw power from a car battery, perhaps through a cigarette lighter.
   The Jarvik heart first was implanted into 61-year-old dentist
Barney Clark on Dec. 2, 1982, by William DeVries at the University
of Utah. Clark lived for 112 days on the Jarvik-7, and died after
suffering a seizure, pneumonia and kidney failure.
   Carolyn Stadler of St. Charles, Mo., held the record for living
the longest on an artificial heart, 440 days. She received her
second human heart last fall and died last week at 57.
   Experts believe 20,000 to 75,000 Americans could use a
transplant; in 1988 1,630 transplants were performed. Doctors and
officials hope the artificial heart eventually will make up for the
lack of live heart donors.

   Proponents of artificial hearts fear the Food and Drug
Administration's withdrawal of approval for the Jarvik heart could
hurt research toward a totally implantable device, but most see it
as a temporary setback.
   And they don't believe the action will have a serious impact on
heart patients because other temporary heart-assist devices still
are available as a bridge to a heart transplant.
   ``It is a shame because the Jarvik, for its limitation, did make
some positive contributions,'' said Dr. Antonio Gotto, chief of
internal medical services at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston
and past president of the American Heart Association. ``I hope this
will be only a temporary, not a permanent, setback toward the goal
of achieving a totally implantable heart.'' The FDA informed
Symbion Inc. of Tempe, Ariz., this week that it was withdrawing
approval for continued investigational uses of its artificial
heart, both as a permanent replacement and a temporary bridge for
patients awaiting a human heart transplant.
   The Jarvik heart, named after its inventor, Dr. Robert Jarvik,
gained household recognition after it was implanted in Barney Clark
on Dec. 2, 1982. He lived 112 days, his new heart tethered to a
bulky external power system, before he succumbed to multiple organ
failure.
   In revoking Symbion's approval, the FDA said it had found
``serious deficiencies'' in manufacturing quality control,
monitoring of research sites, servicing of equipment, training of
personnel and reporting of adverse reactions to FDA.
   Dr. Donald Olsen, director of the University of Utah's Institute
for Biomedical Engineering, said he was ``surprised and
disappointed'' by the FDA's action and hoped it would not hurt
future federal funding of artificial heart research in general,
particularly for totally implantable devices.
   ``Our concern, of course, is that this particular publicity will
not have a negative influence'' on artificial heart development in
general, said Olsen.
   ``But I would like to make sure (people know) that the
artificial heart did not fail; it was a failure on the part of
Symbion to meet the requirements of the FDA'' for improving the
device.
   Gerson Rosenberg, a biomedical engineer who leads Pennsylvania
State University's efforts to design an electric heart, said he did
not think the decision to pull the Jarvik would hinder research.
   But others felt the decision could slow research in the field.
   ``By removing the Jarvik, you take the first and main artificial
heart player out of the ballgame,'' said Dr. Jacob Kolff, who heads
Temple University's efforts to develop the temporary ``Philadelphia
Heart.''
   ``That leaves a bit of a vacuum for those researchers who think
there may be a future for an artificial heart,'' said the surgeon,
whose father, Dr. Willem Kolff, developed the first artificial
kidney in 1943.
   Withdrawal of the permanent Jarvik heart leaves only one other
natural-heart replacement with FDA investigational approval, but
that device is used only as a temporary bridge and only at Hershey
Medical Center of Penn State.
   Other companies have approvals for temporary implants and for
left ventricular assist pumps that help the natural heart work
without replacement.

   After months on the sidelines because of a
stock-trading scandal, former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe will
attempt a political comeback next week with a trip to Moscow.
   Analysts say he's after Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's job.
   Abe, who helped put Kaifu in power five months ago, is to meet
Monday with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow. The meeting
has produced an avalanche of publicity for Abe, who currently holds
no government or party post.
   The Moscow meeting will coincide with Kaifu's visits to Poland
and Hungary at the end of his current tour of Europe, widely seen
as the prime minister's attempt to demonstrate expertise in foreign
affairs before the crucial parliamentary elections in mid-February.
   Abe, 65, seems to be putting himself firmly in the running if
the governing Liberal Democratic Party fares poorly in the
elections but does not lose its majority _ and Kaifu is shouldered
aside.
   ``He (Abe) had been planning this for a long time, and clearly
hopes to use it as a steppingstone to the top post,'' said
political analyst Asao Yamaguchi.
   Igor Latsyshev, Tokyo bureau chief for the Soviet newspaper
Pravda, said Abe is ``a very well-known person in the Soviet Union
and has met with Mr. Gorbachev before. ... It is only to be
expected that he could meet Mr. Gorbachev.''
   Major newspapers have reported that the government is
considering sending Abe to China in March to resume normal
relations, which were cooled after the bloody suppression of the
pro-democracy movement last year.
   The diplomatic drive marks a strong comeback for Abe, who
analysts say was to succeed former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita
until the Recruit scandal last year shook the foundations of
Japanese politics.
   Abe and Takeshita were among many top politicians tainted by
donations from the Recruit Co. conglomerate, which is accused of
bribing other politicians and bureaucrats with bargain-priced share
deals. Takeshita resigned as prime minister last April and Abe
relinquished the party's No. 2 post, but they maintain control of
party factions.
   They agreed on naming Kaifu to replace Takeshita's hapless
successor, Sousuke Uno, who was embroiled in a sex scandal and
resigned after the party lost badly in an election last summer for
the upper house of Parliament.
   Kaifu, a member of a small party faction, has no personal power
base. Yamaguchi said Kaifu has been reduced to little more than a
spokesman while party power brokers such as Abe, Takeshita and
former Deputy Prime Minister Shin Kanemaru run things.
   ``They have ignored him for most of the past year,'' the analyst
said. ``All he can really hope to do is wait for their decisions
and then try to modify them to include his own ideas.''
   Yamaguchi said Kaifu's weakness has become more apparent
recently because the party elders' desire to shape election
strategy has drawn them out of the shadows.
   Scandal-tainted leaders like Abe and former Finance Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa apparently hope their being re-elected will bury
the Recruit issue and give them a mandate to return to the
political forefront.
   Next month's election is expected to be an uphill battle for the
long-governing party, which has seen its popularity plunge because
of the Recruit scandal, a sales tax it forced through Parliament
and agricultural policies that have alienated farmers.
   Kaifu said his goal is to maintain a simple majority, or 257 of
the 512 lower house seats.
   Analysts point out that just winning a simple majority would be
little cause for the Liberal Democrats to celebrate since it would
actually mean a loss of 37 seats. And Kaifu could be sacrificed to
atone for such a poor showing.
   Abe, a canny politician whose father was a lawmaker and whose
father-in-law was the late Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, will try
to gain attention in Moscow by telling the Soviet leader it's time
for Moscow to resolve a territorial dispute with Japan and agree on
a peace treaty to officially end World War II.
   Abe's backers portray him as the man who will be prime minister
when Gorbachev visits Japan in 1991. ``My feeling is that Gorbachev
thinks Abe is most likely to be Japan's prime minister when he is
to visit Japan next year,'' said lawmaker Toshio Yamaguchi, who
will travel with Abe to Moscow.
   All this planning depends on whether Japanese voters are willing
to forgive Abe and other party leaders for their links to the
Recruit scandal.

<HEAD>Paper Reports Secret Written Syrian Pledge to Withdraw From
Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syria gave Saudi Arabia and other Arab states
an unpublicized written pledge to negotiate a timetable for
withdrawing all of its 40,000 troops from Lebanon as part of an
overall political accord reached with legislators of that country
last October, The Washington Post reported today.
   The paper cited unidentified diplomatic sources in Damascus and
in other Arab capitals.
   The paper said its sources said the secret commitment was signed
by Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Charaa during an Oct. 20 visit to
Damascus by his Saudi counterpart Prince Saud Faisal.
   The sources said the document reflects what is already publicly
stated in the Taif accords: that within two years of the formation
of a ``national unity'' government and the initiation of political
reforms, Syria will redeploy it troops from Beirut to the western
Bekaa valley and then negotiate with the new government on a
timetable for full withdrawal from Lebanon.
   The paper said Syrian officials would not comment when asked
about the secret pledge.
   It said diplomats speculate that Syria fears disclosure would be
widely viewed as a victory for Gen. Michel Aoun, the Lebanese
strongman who has marshaled Christian opposition to the Taif
agreement on grounds it does not lay out a public timetable for
withdrawal of the Syrian military from Lebanon.

   Drew Middleton, a reporter who covered World War
II and post-war Europe for The New York Times and later became the
newspaper's military correspondent, has died at age 76.
   He died late Wednesday in his sleep at his Upper East Side
apartment. The cause of his death was not immediately known, the
Times reported. He suffered a heart attack three years ago, but
continued writing newspaper columns despite his frail health.
   Middleton covered Allied forces in North Africa and on several
European fronts, reported on peace conferences and war-crimes
tribunals at the end of the war, and followed post-war events from
both sides of a divided Europe and at the United Nations.
   He was posted in Germany from 1947 to 1953, then moved to
London, where he was the Times' chief correspondent until 1963. He
later served as bureau chief in Paris, at the United Nations and
Belgium. He returned to the United States in 1970 as military
correspondent until his retirement in 1984.
   Middleton authored several books, including ``The Struggle for
Germany,'' ``These Are the British,'' ``The Atlantic Community,''
``Submarine,'' and ``Crossroads of Modern Warfare.''
   He is survived by his wife, the former Estelle Mansel-Edwards,
and a daughter, Judith.

   Two women who gave birth during a
battle between government troops and Moslem rebels in the southern
Philippines named their babies after weapons used in the firefight,
the military said today.
   Bazooka and Armalite, both boys, were born Sunday during heavy
gunfire between government troops and guerrillas of the Moro
National Liberation Front in Lutayan town in Sultan Kudarat
province, about 600 miles southeast of Manila, the report said.
   The report said the mothers went into labor as soon as the
15-minute firefight began. Both gave birth on the spot and were
brought to a nearby clinic after the shooting stopped.
   The report did not give the babies' surnames or their parents
names.
   The 50 Moslem rebels withdrew after the shooting. There were no
reports of casualties on either side.

<TEXT>
   Kiko Kawashima, a college graduate student,
accepted gifts from the imperial palace today, formally sealing her
engagement to Emperor Akihito's son, Prince Aya.
   ``I humbly state my acceptance,'' Miss Kawashima, wearing a pink
kimono and gold sash, said as imperial chamberlain Yasuo Shigeta
presented her with a list of the gifts.
   The gifts _ two large fish placed face to face, six bottles of
rice wine and three bolts of silken cloth _ had been taken to the
Kawashima residence and carefully arranged on separate tables
before Shigeta's arrival.
   Miss Kawashima and Prince Aya, who is second in line to the
throne after his elder brother, are to be married in late June, and
the government plans to spend about $1 million for the lavish
ceremony and receptions afterward.
   It will be the first royal marriage since 1984, and is expected
to be a welcome respite after a year of mourning Emperor Hirohito's
death last January.
   Today's ceremony, which lasted less than one hour, was to be
followed later in the day by courtesy calls on the emperor, Empress
Michiko and Aya by top government officials, including heads of the
legislature and Supreme Court.
   Shigeta, clad in a black morning coat and carrying a silk top
hat, arrived at the Kawashima in a limousine.
   As more than 100 photographers and reporters watched from a
narrow street below, the graying chamberlain climbed four flights
of outdoor stairs to the Kawashima apartment on the campus of
Gakushuin University, where Miss Kawashima's father teaches
economics.
   Aya and Miss Kawashima, who is studying pyschology, first met at
the university in 1985. Aya, 24, is to complete postgraduate
studies in zoology at Oxford in early June. He is to return to
England on Sunday.
   Shigeta was received in the guest room of the four-room
apartment by Miss Kawashima and her father, Tatsuhiko, and mother,
Kazuyo. Because of her commoner background, Miss Kawashima, 23, has
been nicknamed the Apartment Princess.
   In early February, Miss Kawashima will begin her ``princess
education,'' a series of classes in poetry, the constitution,
history and imperial traditions that will last several months.
   It is common in Japan for a prospective groom to present his
fiance and her family with betrothal presents prior to marriage.
   Though the presents themselves are not extravagant, they have
symbolic significance. For instance, the name of the fish, ``tai,''
recalls the Japanese word for congratulations, ``medetai.''
   More than 1,000 officers were mobilized by the Metropolitan
Police Department to secure the area around the Kawashima residence
from attack by radicals.
   On Monday, a projectile struck the home of Emperor Akihito's
brother, Prince Hitachi, leaving a hole in its roof. No injuries
were reported, but police have stepped up measures to protect
imperial family members.
   The ultra-leftist Middle Core Faction claimed responsibility for
the attack Monday, and vowed to step up its anti-monarchy activity
in the coming months.
   Aya's brother, Crown Prince Naruhito, turns 30 next month and is
reportedly having trouble finding a woman to his liking who is both
suitable and willing to become Japan's next empress.

   For those thirtysomething,
fortysomething and even older, the nominations for the 32nd Annual
Grammy Awards turned out to be really something.
   Led by the triumphant return of Eagles drummer Don Henley with
``The End of the Innocence,'' which collected four top nominations,
seasoned musicians _ and their critically acclaimed works _
dominated key Grammy categories.
   While several fresh faces such as Janet Jackson collected
several leading nominations, many were given on Thursday to such
veterans as Bette Midler, Bonnie Raitt, Tom Petty, Billy Joel,
Linda Ronstadt, Mike Rutherford and Joe Cocker.
   Even the Rolling Stones got a nomination _ for group rock
performance on their ``Mixed Emotions'' single.
   Rising star Richard Marx, on the other hand, was blanked in the
album and record of the year competition, drawing a nomination for
pop male vocal instead.
   Gilda Radner, Roy Orbison, Keith Whitley and Hank Williams Sr.
were posthumous nominees. Orbison was nominated for pop vocal
performance for the single ``You Got It,'' and twice with pals
Petty, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne and Bob Dylan for their
``Traveling Wilburys'' collaboration.
   Album of the year selections were ``The End of the Innocence,''
Petty's ``Full Moon Fever,'' Miss Raitt's ``Nick of Time,''
``Traveling Wilburys Volume One'' by the Traveling Wilburys and
``The Raw &amp; The Cooked'' by the Fine Young Cannibals.
   Of all those groups, only Fine Young Cannibals have emerged in
the last 10 years.
   The late Nat ``King'' Cole will receive a special lifetime
achievement award during the show, presented Feb. 21 at the Shrine
Auditorium.
   The three-hour show will be broadcast live on CBS-TV.
   Henley's brooding ``The End of the Innocence'' album was
nominated for album of the year and best male rock performance. The
title track was put in competition for record and song of the year.
The latter is a songwriting nomination shared with pianist Bruce
Hornsby, of the group Bruce Hornsby and the Range.
   Miss Midler, in the midst of parental concerns, was caught by
surprise when her ``Wind Beneath My Wings'' single from the movie
``Beaches'' earned record, song and female pop performance
nominations.
   ``To tell you the truth, I haven't been paying a lot of
attention _ I have a lot of things going on, with the baby and
everything else,'' Ms. Midler said by phone from her home here as
3-year-old Sophie cried.
   Nominations for male rock performance typified the aging face of
the awards: Henley, Petty, Cocker, Neil Young and Lou Reed.
   Former Genesis guitarist Rutherford and his band Mike and the
Mechanics were nominated for best record and song for the
sentimental single ``The Living Years,'' as well as pop group
performance and short form music video.
   ``The Living Years'' is a personal story about the singer's
relationship with his late father. ``I think it's one of those
songs that sort of reaches anybody,'' Rutherford said from his
cottage in the English countryside.
   Among the more noteworthy nominations, three members of the
Beatles will be factors in this year's Grammys show.
   Paul McCartney will be given a lifetime achievement award.
Harrison was nominated as a member of the Traveling Wilburys, and
Ringo Starr was nominated with Buck Owens for the single ``Act
Naturally.''
   In the unusual nominations derby, Vanessa Williams, the would-be
Miss America, was nominated for rhythm and blues performance for
``Dreamin''' and jailed singer James Brown shared a best R&amp;B duo
nomination with Aretha Franklin.
   The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences announced
the nominations at a Beverly Hilton Hotel press conference hosted
by singer Olivia Newton-John and producer Quincy Jones.
   There were 388 nominees representing 113 record companies.

<HEAD>Turkey Files Federal Complaint Seeking Return Of Ancient Silver
Coins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLISON J. PUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government of Turkey is suing an American
millionaire and his partners for the return of a $10 million
collection of ancient silver coins that were allegedly dug up
illegally and smuggled out of Turkey.
   About 1,900 silver coins were excavated in the region of
Anatolia in 1984 and smuggled to dealers in West Germany, according
to the complaint filed in federal court Dec. 29.
   The coins, which date to the 5th century B.C., are from the
ancient Greek and Lycian cultures. They include a number of
decadrahms, a rare group of Athenian coins.
   The complaint seeks return of the coins or payment of damages in
excess of $10 million, said Lawrence Kaye, a lawyer with the New
York firm representing Turkey.
   Those named in the complaint include William Koch of West Palm
Beach, Fla., his Dedham business, Oxbow Corp., and OKS Partners, a
firm which includes Koch.
   Carey Ramos, a lawyer for Oxbow, said the coins had been
obtained from a Munich dealer who documented his legal ownership.
The Turks have no legal right to the coins, he said.
   ``Athenians traveled throughout the Mediterranean world. Who do
(the coins) belong to? If you want to get into a philosphical
debate, I suppose you'd say they belong to somebody in Athens 2,500
years ago,'' said Ramos.
   But the Turkish government has laid claim to all antiquities
found on Turkish soil since the beginning of the century, Kaye said.
   The coins ``are a unique and invaluable collection. They're a
part of the Turkish heritage,'' Kaye said.
   Turkish law prohibits excavation without a license, said Harry
I. Rand, another attorney representing Turkey.
   The group that excavated the coins has been prosecuted and some
members are serving prison sentences in Turkey, Kaye said.
   Whether or not Koch knew the coins were smuggled out of Turkey
under spurious circumstances is not the point, Rand said, adding,
``It's a question of who has a superior right of possession,
without regard as to whether people acquired them in good faith.''
   Ramos would not disclose how many of the coins were in the
possession of his clients, but Connoisseur magazine, in an article
last year, said the OKS partnership had bought about 1,650 coins
for $2.7 million in 1984. Koch later sold about 60 of the coins,
the magazine said.
   John Klarfeld, an Oxbow spokesman, identified the dealers as a
Turkish family named Telligaoglis and said they had obtained a
legal bill of sale for some of the coins in Massachusetts courts.
   ``The Turks are the ones that say these things. We haven't said
anything. Where they came from is Germany. Where before that? No
comment,'' Klarfeld said.

<HEAD>Adoptive Father Pleads Guilty to Abusing Three Sons, Friend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the first single men to
adopt children in Florida pleaded guilty to sexually abusing three
of his adoptive sons and another boy and got a 15-year prison term.
   One of the three adoptive sons supported the plea arrangement
and said he was relieved the 2{-year-old case would not go to
trial, but another told the judge at Thursday's hearing the
sentence was too lenient.
   David Lindsey Sr., 45, had eight other adoptive sons not
involved in the case, and four of them were at the hearing and
continued to support him.
   Lindsey declined to comment on his plea as he was fingerprinted
in the courtroom, handcuffed and led away to a courthouse holding
cell.
   But defense lawyer Richard Lubin said afterward that despite the
formal acknowledgement of guilt, Lindsey maintained his innocence
on all charges.
   ``It was a pragmatic decision that he made,'' Lubin said.
   Lindsey had been convicted on Sept. 28 of lewd assault on a
14-year-old boy, and Lubin said, ``He learned at his last trial
that whether there's reasonable doubt or not, you can easily be
convicted of child abuse.''
   Lindsey was sentenced Nov. 11 on the previous conviction to 5{
years in prison and three years of probation and was forbidden to
have contact with children younger than 16.
   He first sought permission to adopt a son in 1969, when
single-parent adoptions were a rarity. After two years of volunteer
work at an orphanage, he was given his first son. He eventually
adopted 11 boys.
   In 1987, one of the boys went to authorities with allegations of
sexual abuse after he had a series of quarrels with his adoptive
father.
   That boy supported the plea arrangement.
   ``It's been a long-awaited day, and I'm glad it's here and we
don't have to go through a trial,'' he said. ``I think it serves
the interests of all of us in the long run.''
   But another of the adoptive sons Lindsey pleaded guilty to
abusing said at the hearing the 15-year prison sentence was
insufficient.
   ``I don't agree because I've had some real problems with this
man,'' said the youth, now 15. ``I'm having a real crisis.''
   Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Thomas Sholts said he understood
the boy's fears, but said a plea would be better for him in the
long run.
   Supporters of Lindsey attending the hearing included his wife _
whom he married after adopting the boys _ his mother, his two
sisters and four of his other adopted sons, who have backed Lindsey
since his arrest in June 1987.
   Lindsey had faced 17 sex-related charges, all involving three of
his adopted sons and a fourth boy, a friend of one of the sons.
Lindsey agreed to plea guilty to one charge each against the four
boys, and the remaining 13 charges were dropped.
   One of the charges Lindsey pleaded guilty to involved a boy
under 12 and carried a mandatory 25-year sentence, but that term
was reduced under the agreement.
   In addition, Lindsey cannot be prosecuted for any illegal sexual
activity occurring before the plea, whether prosecutors know about
it or not.
   Lindsey's sentence also includes psychiatric treatment and
prohibits any contact with children under age 16 during his
probation. Lindsey agreed under the plan to drop his appeal of the
earlier conviction.
   The judge also extended Lindsey's probation on the earlier
lewd-assault conviction from three to 10 years.

   China and the Soviet Union, which support
opposing sides in Cambodia's 11-year-old civil war, agree that the
United Nations should help settle the conflict, a senior Soviet
official said today.
   ``We in general are of the same opinion with our Chinese
colleagues that the U.N. should play a very major role in the
process of a settlement,'' Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Rogachev
said at the end of a four-day visit.
   ``Actually I don't know who can deny the role of the United
Nations,'' Rogachev told reporters when asked about an Australian
proposal calling for a U.N. trusteeship to administer Cambodia
until general elections are held.
   The Australian proposal is to be discussed at a meeting of the
five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council in Paris
starting Monday. Rogachev said he will attend for the Soviet side.
The other members of the Security Council are China, the United
States, Britain and France.
   Moscow has provided financial support for Vietnam's invasion of
Cambodia that installed a government in Phnom Penh. China is the
main backer of the anti-Vietnam resistance, in particular the Khmer
Rouge guerrillas.
   China has welcomed the Australian plan but said there is no
change in its support for resistance leader Prince Norodom
Sihanouk's plan calling for a four-party coalition government
including the three factions of the resistance and the
Vietnam-backed Hun Sen government.
   Sihanouk himself has said he would back the U.N. trusteeship
idea if his proposal proves unworkable. Hun Sen has voiced
opposition to the Sihanouk plan, saying he does not want the Khmer
Rouge included.
   The Khmer Rouge held power from 1975 to 1978 and were blamed for
the deaths of up to 1 million Cambodians.
   Rogachev, in a meeting with Hun Sen in Phnom Penh last month,
``expressed firm support'' for Hun Sen's position that he was
willing to discuss setting up a U.N. interim authority, he said.
   Rogachev also denied that Chinese-Soviet relations have
deteriorated because China's hard-line leadership blames Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for the ouster of hard-line leaders
in Eastern Europe.
   ``After these consultations I'm sure everything will go smoothly
in our bilateral relations,'' he said.
   Rogachev said Chinese Premier Li Peng will visit the Soviet
Union ``very soon.'' Li's visit, which follows Gorbachev's trip to
Beijing last May, is likely to be sometime this spring, Soviet
sources have said.
   During his stay, Rogachev held talks with Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen, Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei and Liu Shuqing,
director of the State Council Office of Foreign Affairs.

<HEAD>Khmer Rouge Claim Attacks On Route 5</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodian guerrillas claimed today that
they struck the cross-country Route 5, hampering government
transport, and seized outposts near the fabled temples of Angkor.
   Neither claim could be verified by sources in Thailand, and the
media of the Vietnamese-installed government have claimed the
guerrillas have been routed in recent fighting.
   On the diplomatic front, a Soviet envoy visiting Beijing said
today that China and the Soviet Union _ which support opposing
sides in Cambodia's 11-year civil war _ agree the United Nations
should play a major role in settling the conflict. A U.N. Security
Council meeting on Cambodia begins in Paris on Monday.
   The radio of the Chinese-supported Khmer Rouge said the
guerrillas cut three bridges in the latest attack on Route 5 on
Jan. 7, the 11th anniversary of the downfall of the communist Khmer
Rouge government.
   The attacks have ``nearly choked'' government transport on the
road, and strikes on an adjoining railway line have ``completely
interrupted'' transport there, it said.
   Route 5 runs from the Thai border in the northwest to the
national capital of Phnom Penh about 220 miles away.
   Khmer Rouge radio claims often have exaggerated the success of
the guerrilla strikes.
   The group led by Pol Pot killed hundreds of thousands of people
during its 3{-year rule of terror and famine before Soviet-backed
Vietnam invaded in late 1978 and installed another communist
government.
   The non-communist forces of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, allies of
the Khmer Rouge, said they seized four outposts 25 miles north of
Angkor Wat in simultaneous attacks on Jan. 7. A statement said the
outposts in Varin district had been defending the capital of
western Siem Reap province.
   Angkor Wat, an architectural wonder just outside the provincial
capital, was the capital of a large Cambodian empire that reached
its peak in the 12th and 13th centuries.
   Western diplomats said the Khmer Rouge appeared to be waging
mainly psychological warfare by timing an increase in attacks with
the Jan. 7 anniversary.
   Official reports from Phnom Penh have confirmed that there have
been several explosions in the capital and that the Khmer Rouge had
struck in the area of Battambang, the second-largest city.
   The guerrilla radio said Thursday that after smashing strategic
positions there Jan. 5 and 6, the guerrillas continued attacks
along the Sangke River in the ``east Battambang town battlefield.''
It claimed the guerrillas ``liberated'' 38 villages, killed or
wounded government soldiers and ``freed'' commune and village
officials.
   Igor Rogachev, Soviet deputy foreign minister, said in Beijing
at the end of a four-day visit that Moscow officials ``in general
are of the same opinion with our Chinese colleagues that the U.N.
should play a very major role in the process of a settlement.''
   An Australian proposal, which calls for a U.N. trusteeship to
administer Cambodia until general elections are held, is to be
discussed during the Security Council meeting in Paris.

<HEAD>Report Blasts INS, Seeks Halt to Employer Sanctions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California's civil-rights agency said the
federal Immigration and Naturalization Service isn't doing enough
to stop discrimination against foreign-looking job-seekers.
   The state Fair Employment and Housing Commission said the
federal agency has not educated employers adequately about an
anti-discrimination provision in a 1986 immigration law, leaving
many of them afraid to hire Hispanics and other ethnic applicants
despite proof of legal residency.
   The state commission, in a report issued Thursday, called for a
suspension of penalties against employers who hire illegal aliens
until the INS improves its educational efforts and clears up its
backlog of applications for work-authorization documents.
   ``Motivated by ignorance, confusion and fear of sanctions, some
employers have engaged in citizenship status discrimination,'' the
commission said.
   For example, it said, employers have rejected some types of
valid work-authorization documents, demanded documents only from
applicants who appeared foreign, or sought authorization documents
from employees hired before 1986, whom the law exempted.
   In addition, the report said, ``in its educational contacts with
employers, the INS places undue emphasis on employer sanctions (for
knowingly hiring undocumented workers) and gives little or no
attention to the anti-discrimination obligations of employers.''
   The report accused the INS of inactivity in filing
discrimination complaints. Many immigrants and refugees are
discouraged from filing such complaints by ``lack of knowledge,
fear of governmental authorities and fear of employer
retaliation,'' it said.
   Testimony cited by the commission indicated the INS ``appears to
be targeting Hispanic and other ethnic employers, particularly in
the restaurant industry,'' for investigations and penalties.
   The commission took testimony from employers, workers, unions
and government officials last year at hearings in Oakland, Fresno
and Los Angeles.
   Its report follows other critical studies of the law by a New
York state agency and a task force of the American Civil Liberties
Union and the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.
   INS spokeswoman Virginia Kice defended the agency's performance,
noting that it had spent millions of dollars and thousands of hours
in educating employers about the Immigration Reform and Control Act
of 1986, or IRCA.
   ``The INS has done an excellent job of implementing this law,''
Ms. Kice said. ``I don't think anyone can classify employer
sanctions or IRCA as a failure.''
   But the California commission, whose seven members were
appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian, reported widespread ignorance
of the law's requirements and its anti-discrimination provisions.
   The 1986 law allowed aliens living in the United States since
Jan. 1, 1982, to seek legal residency, provided fines of up to
$10,000 for knowingly hiring undocumented aliens, and prohibited
job discrimination against those seeking legalization.
   The commission called for changes in the law, including a ban on
discriminatory treatment of immigrant farm workers, some of whom
are being paid below the minimum wage.
   At a news conference, commission members said the law's touted
goal of allowing the United States to regain control of its borders
had led the INS to give the ban on job discrimination a low
priority.
   ``The purpose was supposed to be to stem the flow of illegals,''
said commissioner Osias Goren. ``Discrimination became a secondary
thing.''
   The California study has been submitted to the General
Accounting Office, a congressional staff agency, which is scheduled
to report to Congress on the law this month.
   If the GAO finds widespread and pervasive discrimination,
Congress will have 30 days to decide whether to repeal employer
sanctions. The GAO did not make such a finding in a November 1988
report, despite concluding that about 528,000 employers nationwide
were hiring only U.S. citizens or asking only foreign-looking
workers for documentation.

<TEXT>
   A federal court blocked principal
sections of Pennsylvania's 1989 abortion law, the most stringent in
the nation, but abortion foes claimed victory because other
sections were left intact.
   The injunction was issued Thursday, just five days before the
abortion law takes effect. It struck down requirements that women
notify their husbands before having an abortion and wait 24 hours
for the procedure after requesting it.
   Attorneys representing the American Civil Liberties Union,
Planned Parenthood-Pennsylvania Affiliates and the Women's Law
Project said the injunction would preserve women's rights to legal
abortion.
   The ruling ``is an important first step in the battle to
preserve women's rights to choose abortion in Pennsylvania,'' said
lawyer Thomas E. Zemaitis, speaking on behalf of the Women's Law
Project.
   But abortion opponents noted that sections banning abortions
because of a fetus' sex and prohibiting most abortions after 24
weeks of pregnancy were not challenged. They said the injunction
could be counted as a victory for their cause.
   ``The real story today is not what was challenged in court but
rather what was not,'' said Mary Beliveau of the Pennsylvania
Pro-Life Federation. ``This is good news for the pro-life movement
in Pennsylvania.''
   The law's author, Republican state Rep. Stephen Freind, said:
``It's a big step forward for the pro-life side ...Two great
provisions go into effect next week.''
   Judge Daniel H. Huyett III issued the decision only hours after
lawyers for the state and pro-choice advocates met in his chambers
in Reading, Pa. A complaint challenging provisions in the law was
filed by Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania and other
clinics as an amendment to a pending case against the state's 1988
abortion law.
   Freind said he expected the case to go to trial by the middle of
the year.
   Pennsylvania was the first state to take advantage of broader
authority to restrict abortion granted under last year's Supreme
Court ruling in Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services.
   In that Missouri case, the court upheld a law that banned the
use of public funds or facilities for abortion and required tests
after 24 weeks of pregnancy to determine if the fetus could survive
outside the womb.
   Anti-abortion advocates have maintained the Pennsylvania law
could present the court with another avenue to reconsider the
landmark Roe vs. Wade decision, which established abortion as a
constitutional right in 1973.
   But the two provisions most frequently cited as conflicting with
Roe vs. Wade, the ban against sex-selection abortions and a
prohibition on most abortions after 24 weeks, were not challenged.
   Pro-choice attorneys said Pennsylvania women were not seeking
abortions after 24 weeks and that abortions to select the sex of a
fetus have not occured in the state.
   Moreover, they said abortions have effectively been banned after
24 weeks, except to save the life of the mother, since 1974.
   ``We ... are not scared of Stephen Freind or other legislators
who continue to interfere with the private lives of the women in
this state,'' said Kathryn Kolbert, an attorney for the American
Civil Liberties Union.
   In April 1988, a federal judge blocked provisions in the state's
1988 abortion law that required teen-agers to obtain the consent of
at least one parent or a court order for an abortion and set up
reporting requirements for clinics. In 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court
stuck down key sections of the state's 1982 law.

   The snow squalls, high winds and frigid air that spawned
near-blizzard conditions in Michigan churned toward the Northeast
today with gusts over 40 mph.
   Light rain fell late Thursday in the Pacific Northwest after
three days of severe flooding in southwestern Washington and
northwestern Oregon.
   Shortly after sunset Thursday, Muskegon, Mich., reported winds
to 50 mph and visibility near zero. Snow fell at the rate of an
inch an hour on some parts of the state.
   In Wisconsin, winds gusting to more than 50 mph turned discarded
Christmas trees into street hazards, knocked down power lines and
picked up loose soil in areas with no snow cover.
   Gale-force winds in Minnesota prompted a blizzard warning,
produced scattered power outages, wrecked ice-fishing shacks and
blew the bricks off a 100-year-old church in St. Paul.
   Snow and blowing snow advisories continued near Lake Superior
and Lake Michigan, where as much as 7 inches of new snow was
expected by today.
   Strong northwest winds prevailed from the northern and central
Plains to the lower Ohio Valley and upper Great Lakes. Strong
southerly winds continued from the upper Ohio Valley and the lower
Great Lakes to the mid-Atlantic Coast.
   Fog developed in California's valleys and along the western Gulf
Coast. An advisory for dense fog was called for Galveston and
Chambers counties in southeast Texas.
   Thursday's high temperatures were in the 20s and 30s from the
northern Rockies to the northern Atlantic Coast.
   Sunny skies warmed temperatures into the 60s in the South.
   Seven cities reported new record highs for the date: Ely, Nev.,
60 degrees; Flagstaff, Ariz., and Albuquerque, N.M. 63; Greer,
S.C., 67; Asheville, N.C., 68; Bakersfield, Calif., 80, and Austin,
Texas, 85.
   The high for the nation Thursday was 87 degrees at McAllen, Tex.

   A prisoner climbed onto a jail roof and stumped
officials trying to coax him down by making a demand only ardent
students of early 1970s television trivia could meet: Name all six
children on ``The Brady Bunch.''
   Nobody on the Deer Island jail's staff knew that the answer was
Marcia, Greg, Jan, Peter, Cindy and Bobby. But after more than five
hours, the inmate came down anyway, said Deputy Penal Commissioner
George Romanos.
   The inmate, jailed since October for receiving a stolen vehicle,
was not identified because no charges were filed.
   The inmate had wrapped himself in a sheet and used scaffolding
to scale the five-floor prison on Tuesday afternoon, Romanos said.
   ``He did this on a lark,'' Romanos said.

<HEAD>Philippines Says U.S. Violating Bases Pact</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Philippines says the United
States has failed to live up to its commitments under a pact that
allows Washington to maintain military bases in the country.
   A senior foreign department official said Thursday that a list
of the alleged violations of the accord, signed by the countries in
1988, would be delivered to the U.S. Embassy within a few days.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Philippine ambassador to the United States, Emmanuel Pelaez, will
deliver a similar list to U.S. Secretary of State James Baker III.
   Under the accord, the United States would give $962 million to
the Philippines in exchange for using Clark Air Base, Subic Bay
Naval Station and four smaller bases during the last two years of
the 1947 Military Bases Agreement, which expires in 1991.
   A lease extension requires a new treaty to be approved by the
23-member Senate, where there is strong sentiment against the bases.
   But several provisions of the current accord have not been
fulfilled, the foreign official said.
   They include the United States converting $29.5 million of
accumulated foreign military sales credits into grants; providing
$8 million over two years to help Philippine troops in improving
base security; and providing $10 million over two years to relocate
squatters living near the bases.
   ``We assumed good faith,'' the foreign official said. ``We don't
want to quarrel with the Americans. We just want to get the money.''
   He said the Philippines assumed that the United States would do
all it could to fulfill the demands. ``Our understanding of best
efforts is that they will exhaust all channels,'' he added.
   On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus said U.S. budget
cuts might reduce Washington's rental payments for its military
bases.
   President Corazon Aquino said Monday that negotiations on the
future of the bases might begin in March or April. She has refused
to say publicly how she feels about the issue.

   A small band of anti-Noriega
guerrillas ruled this western border post for more than two weeks
after U.S. troops toppled Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, but the
group is now disbanding, its leader says.
   Jose Echever said Thursday he led a small band of men into
Panama from Costa Rica on Dec. 21, the day after the U.S. invasion.
They controlled the border post 230 miles west of Panama City until
last Sunday, he said.
   ``Officials of (U.S.) Southern Command wanted us to join the
public security force, but we weren't interested,'' Echever said in
an interview with The Associated Press.
   The new government has dismantled Noriega's Defense Forces and
is creating a new force made up largely of former members. But
Echever said he never wanted to wear a police uniform.
   Echever said he formed the Hugo Spadafora Liberation Battalion
in 1987, naming it in honor of a Noriega opponent who was killed in
September 1985. Spadafora's mangled body was found in a U.S.
mailbag in Costa Rica.
   ``My idea was to free Panama of Noriega, of his crimes, and end
all persecution,'' said Echever, who dubbed himself Commander
Junior.
   Echever said his group consisted of about 200 men, 60 of them
Nicaraguan Contra guerrillas who had previously been fighting
Nicaragua's leftist government. He said the group was based in the
mountains along the Panama-Costa Rica frontier.
   Echever refused to say how many men took part in the Dec. 21
operation, but reporters who passed through this border post after
Christmas never saw more than 20 men in his group.
   Echever, who is using a local restaurant as a command post, said
that as of Thursday he was down to 11 men.
   ``They're trying to figure out where to go next,'' Echever said.
He said he himself would probably head for Panama City.
   He said members of the U.S.-supported Contra movement had
provided training, but that he had paid for the equipment and
Soviet-designed AK-47 assault rifles his men carried.
   ``Nobody gave us a single peso,'' he said.
   Echever, looking more like a pudgy businessman than a guerrilla
despite his ``Soldier of Fortune'' baseball cap, said he owns a
coffee processing factory 10 miles to the west in Costa Rica and
also owns businesses in Miami and the Panamanian port at Colon.
   His group may have been the source of rumors and unconfirmed
published reports that a U.S.-funded group of Contras was operating
against Noriega.
   Echever said only five Nicaraguans came along when he moved his
men to the border post on the Pan-American Highway.

<HEAD>Ousted Hard-Line Leader Could Be Tried On Fraud, Abuse of Power
Charges</HEAD>

   A parliamentary commission is
investigating allegations that ousted Communist leader Todor
Zhivkov violated the rights of ethnic Turks and embezzled millions
of dollars to build villas.
   Petar Beron, a commission member and pro-democracy activist,
said Thursday that Zhivkov will be charged and brought to trial
after the panel completes its investigation, probably by the end of
January.
   ``We think (the charges) will be abuse of power, fraud ...
crimes against the constitution, depriving the whole people of
their rights,'' Beron said.
   Zhivkov, who ruled Bulgaria for 35 years, has not been seen in
public since his ouster Nov. 10. Government officials have denied
he is under house arrest.
   Beron, a member of the influential independent environmental
group Eco-Glasnost, said Zhivkov was being ``protected from the
wrath of the people,'' at his residence at Boyana near Sofia.
   Beron said Zhivkov would likely face charges of depriving the
Turkish minority of basic human rights. He said Zhivkov's campaign
to assimilate the ethnic Turks had provoked ``hatred on a racial,
ethnic and religious basis.''
   Beron said the commission was looking into ``the drainage of
public money'' by Zhivkov, who he said siphoned millions from
government-run foundations promoting arts and education in order to
build more than 30 villas and luxurious residences around the
country.
   Lyuben Kolishev, a leader of the commission, said Tuesday that
enough evidence had already been gathered on Zhivkov to open
criminal proceedings on charges of embezzlement of state funds.
   Kolishev said he had evidence that Zhivkov had Swiss bank
accounts. He gave no further details.
   Beron said the government asked Swiss authorities to open the
accounts but noted this would only be agreed to once a legal case
was opened for crimes that would also be punishable under Swiss law.
   The former foreign minister, Petar Mladenov, replaced Zhivkov as
party leader Nov. 10. He has promised democratic reforms, including
the removal of the Communists' constitutionally guaranteed leading
role in society and free elections expected before June.
   The investigative commission _ led by the No. 2 party leader,
Andrey Lukanov _ originally was formed by the Communist Party but
was later replaced by a parliamentary commission that includes
members of the opposition.
   Government officials began talks this week with nationalist
leaders, opposition figures and representatives of the ethnic
Turkish minority on how to defuse an outbreak of anti-Turkish
sentiment that followed the Communist leadership's decision Dec. 29
to restore ethnic rights.
   Parliament President Stanko Todorov proposed Thursday that a
commission be established to review national policy. He said it
should be headed by Mladenov, the state BTA news agency reported.
The commission is likely to be set up when Parliament meets Monday.

<TEXT>
   Opposition leaders and Communist
officials have tentatively set national elections for June,
government television reported.
   ``According to unofficial information, the first round of
(parliamentary) elections should take place on June 8,''
Czechoslovak TV said Thursday.
   The report came as the Communists, other political parties and
the opposition Civic Forum met to review procedures for the
elections and the status of independent political parties.
   ``The draft elections law is aimed at having the elections for
the Federal Assembly and both National Councils (parliament) first
... and in the second half of the year the elections to the lower
levels of representative bodies should take place,'' the television
said.
   The 35O-member Czechoslovak Parliament is so far dominated by
Communists. The discussions are expected to produce a solution to
balancing its membership to reflect the current political situation.
   The talks are being attended by all five political parties
existing before the revolution and the loosely organized opposition
group, Civic Forum. About 20 new political parties have been
created in Czechoslovakia the past two months, but none is
represented at the current talks.
   The peaceful revolution in Czechoslovakia led to the ouster of
Communist party chief Milos Jakes and his hard-line colleagues in
late November. Dissident playwright Vaclav Havel became president
last month.

   Two brothers are accused of abducting a
woman and exchanging gunshots with her father in a kidnapping
scheme that fell apart because they had to be home by 10 p.m.,
police said.
   Antwan Robinson, 18, and his 16-year-old brother were charged
Thursday with armed robbery, armed kidnapping and aggravated
assault in the abduction of 18-year-old Adriana Buffington,
Metro-Dade police said.
   Robinson was awaiting trial on an unrelated armed robbery charge
and wore a special beeper around his ankle, police said. It lets
authorities know he's home by 10 each night.
   ``This case was a comedy of errors,'' said Detective Tommy
Robson. ``These two victimized an innocent family and could've
easily killed someone.''
   The brothers allegedly planned to abduct a drug-dealer but
grabbed the 18-year-old at 8:30 p.m. Tuesday outside the wrong
house, police said.
   Ms. Buffington was forced into her father's car as her younger
sister ran screaming for help. Their father, John Buffington, fired
a shot from his .38-caliber revolver and the gunmen fired at least
10 shots at the house with automatic pistols, police said.
   They later made a call from a pay phone demanding $18,000 for
Ms. Buffington's return, police said, but dropped the plan at 9:30
p.m. when the money was not found at the church where it was to be
left, police said.
   Ms. Buffington, who was unharmed, drove home with her hands
cuffed in front after her release.
   Police said fingerprints Robinson left in the car led them to
him and his brother, who was not identified because of his age.

<TEXT>
   The scientists who first posed the ``nuclear
winter'' theory say a new study concludes the aftermath of an
atomic war would be even worse than previously believed.
   R.P. Turco, co-author of a study appearing today in Science
magazine, said the study shows that even a ``modest exchange'' of
nuclear weapons could so fill the sky with smoke and soot that
agriculture would be virtually wiped out for one season and could
be severely affected the second year after such a war.
   Starvation would be widespread, he said, even in Third World
nations that are not likely to be hit by bombs.
   ``It looks like most of the human population would be in
jeopardy from a nuclear exchange,'' Turco said in an interview.
``The basic physical principles have been confirmed by detailed
research in the five years since we first proposed the theory.''
   The new findings concentrate on changes in rainfall patterns, on
the effects of black soot arising from atomic bomb-ignited fires
and on the creation of a vast ozone hole over the northern
hemisphere.
   Turco said the study assumes that in even a small nuclear
exchange the primary target would be oil and gas storage areas
because such material is vital to military defense. He said
igniting those stores at once would put enough soot into the
atmosphere to block the sun and, even in July, cause widespread
freezing and destroy food crops for the year.
   ``We need agriculture every year,'' he said. ``Millions and
millions would die.''
   Smoke would eventually dim the sun all over the globe, reducing
solar intensities on a hemispheric scale by up to 50 percent, the
study estimates.
   Turco said the new studies also suggest that smoke in the upper
atmosphere would ``cook away'' up to 50 percent the normal ozone
layer, creating an ozone hole over much of the northern hemisphere.
   This, he said, would further cripple agriculture because of the
effect of intense ultraviolet rays on plants. Ozone normally
shields the Earth from high levels of ultraviolet radiation.
   ``This could be extremely significant and is something that
hasn't been considered before,'' Turco said.
   Turco said the new studies also suggest the nuclear exchange
would disrupt normal rainfall patterns. Summer monsoons essential
to agriculture in parts of Asia would be wiped out, he said,
causing massive crop failures in China, India and southeast Asia.
   Predictions are less precise into the second year after an
atomic war, he said, but ``some effects could continue for two or
three years. This could be enough to further disrupt agriculture,
which is quite sensitive.''
   Co-authors with Turco in the study were O.B. Toon and J.B.
Pollack of NASA's Ames Research Center in California; T.P. Ackerman
of Pennsylvania State University and Carl Sagan of Cornell
University.

   The dollar was lower against most major currencies
in European trading this morning. Gold was higher.
   Trading was subdued ahead of the release of U.S. monthly
economic figures, including December producer prices and retail
sales.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 145.35 yen, up 0.08 yen from
Thursday's close of 145.27 yen. After opening at 145.42 yen, the
currency ranged between 145.30 yen and 145.55 yen.
   Later in London, the dollar traded at 145.37 yen.
   Kozo Yoshida, a dealer with Mitsui Bank in Tokyo, said an extra
note of caution was injected into the market by Bank of Japan Gov.
Yasuhishi Mieno, who expressed concern about inflationary trends.
   Mieno said in a speech today that continued weakness of the yen
threatened price stability and that every 10-yen drop in the
Japanese currency against the dollar translated into a 1.1 percent
increase in wholesale prices.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Thursday:
   _1.6820 West German marks, up from 1.6800
   _1.5027 Swiss francs, down from 1.5210
   _5.7280 French francs, down from 5.7325

   _1,254.00 Italian lire, down from 1,258.50
   _1.1566 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1575
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6620 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6575 late Thursday.
   London's gold dealers fixed a recommended price of $413.90 an
ounce this morning, up from $412.25 bid late Thursday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $413.80, up from $412.75 bid late
Thursday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $2.85 an ounce today to close at $412.47.
   Silver in London traded at a bid price of $5.32 a troy ounce,
down from Thursday's $5.34.

<HEAD>Fog Hampers Search For Missing Plane in Chile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy fog hampered the search today for a
plane that disappeared with five people aboard, including two U.S.
Food and Drug Administration officials who were inspecting Chile's
agricultural exports.
   The search for the two-engine Cessna 206 began at 8 a.m. near
Copiapo, the desert city 500 miles north of Santiago where the
plane took off Wednesday.
   The aircraft was scheduled to arrive in Santiago on Wednesday
night.
   Heavy fog and cloudy skies grounded some search planes during
the morning, but weather conditions cleared later and the operation
resumed at full strength, an official at the Copiapo airport said
in a telephone interview.
   A day-long search Thursday, involving at least 21 planes and
helicopters and land patrols, turned up no sign of the plane.
   Authorities have said there was no indication of sabotage and
that no guerrillas are believed to operate in the areas the plane
was to fly over.
   The Americans _ FDA officials John Harty Jr. of Silver Spring,
Md., and Patrick Pouzar of Nashville, Tenn. _ arrived in Chile on
Saturday.
   They were checking security procedures in the harvesting,
packing and transport of Chilean fruits being exported to the
United States.
   Last year, two grapes laced with cyanide were found in
Philadelphia in a shipment of fruit from Chile. The finding
prompted a temporary suspension of the sale of all Chilean fruits
in the United States.
   The Chileans aboard the missing plane are Oscar Badilla, a
government agricultural official; Sergio Lazcano, an executive of
the Fruit Exporters Association; and an unidentified pilot, police
officer German Fuentes said.
   Police said the search was covering the 500-mile-long route
between Santiago and Copiapo. But rescue workers were concentrating
on the Copiapo area because the Cessna's last radio contact
occurred only 15 minutes after it took off from that city at 5:10
p.m. Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   U.S. military engineers are replacing
combat soldiers, and Panamanian officials are trying to sweep away
the vestiges of Gen. Manual Antonio Noriega's militarism.
   A contingent of 2,200 troops of the 82nd Airborne returned to
their base at Fort Bragg, N.C., today, cheered by hundreds of
friends and relatives.
   In their stead are 4,400 engineers and civil affairs troops who
have arrived in Panama in recent days to help rebuild areas
destroyed in the U.S. invasion Dec. 20, Army Lt. Col. James Swank
said Thursday.
   ``They're nation-building types of soldiers,'' he said.
   The departure of the contingent from the 82nd Airborne leaves
19,600 troops from the 26,000-strong invading force still in
Panama, Swank said.
   On Thursday, President Guillermo Endara and Vice President
Ricardo Arias Calderon began demolishing Panama's old Defense
Forces headquarters.
   ``From the ashes of militarism, a new era is born in which the
state is for the well-being of the people,'' Endara said as he
swung a sledgehammer at what had been the heart of Noriega's
six-year dictatorship.
   In another sign that the old order had crumbled, the leader of
Noriega's paramilitary troops, the Dignity Battalions, surrendered
to U.S. troops. Benjamin Colamarco, an economist, had been in
hiding since the invasion.
   He joins nearly 4,400 other Panamanians, largely members of the
Defense Forces and Dignity Battalions, in U.S. custody. Swank said
Colamarco, one of the most-wanted men in Panama, surrendered
Wednesday.
   Sources inside the Panamanian Security Force that has replaced
Noriega's army said Colamarco was taken to Fort Clayton, where a
number of other close Noriega associates are being held.
   Colamarco's thugs are blamed for setting fire to the slums
surrounding Defense Forces headquarters and sparking some of the
looting that devastated Panama City after the invasion. More than
20,000 residents in the Chorrillo neighborhood were left homeless.
   Panama's new government plans to rebuild the area and replace
the headquarters with a ``democracy plaza.'' The U.S. government
has said it will donate $35 million to the project.
   Endara said seven buildings would be built around the plaza,
part of a 60-building housing project for Chorrillo.
   The invasion led to Noriega's downfall after six years in power.
He escaped capture and sought refuge in the Vatican embassy on Dec.
24. He surrendered to U.S. troops on Jan. 3 and was flown to Miami
to stand trial on drug-trafficking charges.
   Noriega's wife and children have taken refuge in the Cuban
Embassy. Arias, who also is foreign minister, said they will not be
given safe conduct to go to the Dominican Republic, where another
daughter lives.
   He said Felicidad, Noriega's wife, and their daughters Sandra,
Lorena and Thais are accused of covering up a crime and using goods
obtained illegally.
   ``She is a citizen. If there are complaints against her, her
fate is that of any citizen,'' Arias said.
   Rey Sierra Goitia, a private lawyer, filed the complaint against
Mrs. Noriega, according to sources at the attorney general's
office. The government must investigate the charges.
   The U.S. military says 220 Panamanian civilians died in the
invasion and that 314 members of the Panamanian Defense Forces were
killed. Swank said 23 American soldiers and three U.S. civilians
also were killed.

<TEXT>
   Britain's foreign secretary will begin a
four-day visit Saturday with the difficult mission of reassuring
residents of British support as China prepares to assume control of
this crown colony.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said this week that Hong Kong's
prosperity is in danger as apprehension increases about 1997, when
China takes over.
   Beijing's Communist government has agreed to maintain Hong
Kong's capitalist economy for 50 years.
   ``Hong Kong is suffering a hemorrhage of talent and professional
skills,'' Hurd wrote in London's Daily Telegraph. ``We have a duty
to provide additional reassurance and persuade people to remain in
the territory.''
   Because of China's June 3-4 crackdown of its pro-democracy
movement, relations between Hong Kong and China have hit their
lowest point since China's Cultural Revolution.
   The Basic Law, the blueprint for Chinese rule after 1997, will
be completed by March. The last phase in the critical negotiations
began this week when Hong Kong's governor, Sir David Wilson, went
to Beijing for the first time since June 4.
   Wilson said today that he and Chinese officials explained their
positions on the colony's political future, but neither side
reported concrete agreements in three days of talks.
   ``There is still discussion to take place on how the political
model evolves,'' Wilson said at the airport before flying home.
``We have made considerable progress in trying to explain sensibly
and clearly what the problems are on both sides and trying to reach
understanding about them. I think it's been a useful visit in that
context.''
   China's official Xinhua News Agency quoted Premier Li Peng as
telling Wilson he was ``glad to see that on some issues the two
sides are drawing closer,'' but he did not elaborate.
   Sharp exchanges were reported Thursday between Wilson and Deputy
Foreign Minister Zhou Nan, a hard-line official tapped to become
China's senior representative to Hong Kong.
   London's position in the colony is strained by a widespread
feeling that it has abandoned Hong Kong's 5.7 million people to the
Chinese government. Protests are expected during Hurd's visit.
   Each attempt by London at a confidence-restoring measure has
sparked a strong, negative reaction from Beijing. In Hong Kong,
Britain's moves are criticized as being too little, too late.
   Further complicating the issue is the widely condemned forced
repatriation of Vietnamese boat people, which began in December.
   Political analysts, business leaders and intellectuals say
Hurd's visit, his first to the colony as foreign secretary, will do
little to restore confidence among the people.
   ``We listen much more to what China says than to what Britain
says,'' said Simon Murray, group managing director of Hutchinson
Whampoa Ltd., which runs the colony's port and other key businesses.
   Five years ago, Britain agreed to return Hong Kong to Chinese
rule in 1997 in return for Beijing's promise not to touch the
colony's free-wheeling economic and social system for 50 years.
   But confidence in Beijing's agreement evaporated after it
crushed China's student-led pro-democracy movement in June. About
1,000 people emigrate every week, and the number is believed to be
rising.
   Britain announced last month that it would give about 50,000
British passports to key officials and professionals with the aim
of encouraging them to stay in the colony after 1997. But China
accused Britain of breaking their agreement and hinted it would not
recognize the passports.
   In Hong Kong, businessmen and activists criticized the move as
not going far enough to give the colony's scared citizens a
security net. They said the government should hand out at least
250,000 passports, which would place about 1 million people under
the British flag.
   The establishment of democracy in Hong Kong is another hot topic.
   China wants only 30 percent of the legislature elected after
1997 but Britain has been pushing for about 50 percent and for
expanded elections in 1991.

   A man who fought a court battle to get an
abortion for his comatose wife, saying it might help her recover,
says she has been making steady progress and wants to go home.
   ``I hate to say `I told you so,' but it helps to confirm in my
mind that I made the correct decision,'' Martin Klein told The New
York Times for a story published today.
   Klein told WCBS-TV on Thursday that his wife, Nancy, who
regained consciousness in June, is making slow but steady progress,
talking slowly and learning to feed herself.
   Mrs. Klein, who was 18 weeks pregnant, lapsed into a coma after
a car accident on Dec. 13, 1988. Although her chances of emerging
from the coma were slim, doctors told her husband that her chances
would improve slightly if she had an abortion.
   But when he sought to have the abortion performed, he was
challenged by anti-abortion factions and a legal battle ensued that
eventually was resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   The abortion 11 months ago made it safer for Mrs. Klein to
receive medication, said Dr. Caroline O. McCagg, medical director
of the Center for Head Injuries at the Robert Wood Johnson Jr.
Rehabilitation Institute in Edison, N.J.
   The Times reported in its Friday editions that Mrs. Klein is
able to talk, is slowly regaining her memory and wants to go home
to her husband and their 4-year-old daughter Arielle.
   ``She's doing amazingly well,'' said McCagg. ``She's made slow
constant progress. It's incredible.''
   ``Nancy is a fighter,'' Klein said.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Moslem women calling
themselves the Vanguard of Chastity paraded through Iran's capital
today in a campaign against ``moral decadence,'' which they said is
creeping into Iranian society.
   The demonstration was part of a fundamentalist backlash against
the more liberal attitudes that have emerged in the Islamic
republic since the August 1988 cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war.
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani is seeking to improve ties with the
West to secure badly needed foreign investment for postwar
reconstruction. Iranian hard-liners oppose closer Western ties.
   The protesting women wore black chadors, the cloak-like,
head-to-toe robes that Islamic teachings dictate they wear in
public. The official Islamic Republic News Agency said they marched
through Tehran and to Tehran University campus, where Rafsanjani
was delivering his weekly prayer session.
   The demonstrators expressed support for the government, formed
in August after a presidential election, but demanded it do
everything to ``counter the corrupt culture of the West.''
   Hard-liners fear that allowing Western culture to flourish in
Iran, as it did before the 1979 Islamic revolution, will undermine
the revolution.
   Since the cease-fire and the June 3 death of Iran's
revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, there has been a
visible relaxation in observance of the Islamic code that
revolutionary zealots enforced with such severity in the first 10
years after the revolution.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said today's demonstrators read a
nine-point resolution calling for women to be allowed more
participation in political, social and cultural life.
   It also called on Iranian women to ``avoid the vain, luxurious
mode of life'' and observe the Islamic dress code. It asked the
state broadcasting authorities to clean up their programming,
eschew ``corrupt values ... and propagate Islamic values.''
   The postwar period has seen many young women abandoning the
chador for scarves and using cosmetics that have long been banned.
   Some men also have been dressing more stylishly, turning their
backs on the drab revolutionary garb. Many now wear ties,
considered a symbol of Western decadence.
   The radical publication Jomhuri Islami has condemned the trend
and each day publishes letters calling for strict enforcement of
Islamic values.
   One letter, signed by Qorban Husseini of Tehran, complained:
``It has been observed that Tehran shops now sell neckties,
miniskirts _ a full span above the knee _ and so on. When
shopkeepers are asked why they try to promote corrupt Western
clothing, they say that television is allowed to show them.''
   Under a 1987 law, the punishment for failing to observe the
Islamic dress code is 10-20 lashes or a hefty fine. The newspaper
said that unfortunately, ``the law has been put aside.''
   The magazine Pasdar-e Islam even criticized chess, which
Khomeini decreed two years ago was religiously sanctioned, and
boxing, ``one of the most barbaric manifestations of the deviant
Western culture.''
   ``Which chess player has led or played an influential part in
any revolution?'' the magazine asked. ``What scientist or inventor
has used chess to develop his creativity?''

   Two women had their purses snatched by men
riding in vans in separate incidents, both were dragged and one was
crushed and killed when she fell under the vehicle's wheel, police
said.
   Kim Stapleton, who was wearing her purse slung across her torso,
was dragged when a man in a gray van opened the door and grabbed
her purse as she crossed Park Avenue on Manhattan's Upper East Side
early Wednesday afternoon, police said.
   ``I think she couldn't have released it if she wanted to,'' said
Sgt. Joseph Fornabaio.
   Mrs. Stapleton, 60, died when she fell under the van's wheels,
officials said. An owner of an antiques store in Brownsville, Vt.,
she served on the boards of several charities, friends said.
   About four hours later in Brooklyn, Marie Paolillo, 74, was
slashed with a knife after a man inside a van grabbed her shoulder
bag by the strap, said police spokesman Sgt. Pete Berry.
   Paolillo was dragged about 70 feet by the van during the
incident, police said.
   The thieves managed to wrest Paolillo's purse, but the van's
door slammed onto her hand, and she was dragged by the van until
she fell free.
   Paolillo suffered multiple trauma, a right hip fracture and a
broken rib during the attack, Berry said. She was taken to the
critical-care unit of Coney Island Hospital.
   Edward Paolillo, the victim's son, said the man in the vehicle
began ``punching my mother in the face and stabbing at her coat.''
   ``It was just like that other woman on Park Avenue without the
bad ending,'' Edward Paolillo said.
   Police said the vans' descriptions did not match.
   Police had no suspects in custody and said Thursday night there
were no developments in the case.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's Communist premier today bowed
to opposition demands and dropped a plan to form a new secret
police force before the nation's first multiparty elections in May.
   ``Through May 6, no offices will be created in this area,''
Premier Hans Modrow said, referring to election day and the
controversial plan. Members of East Germany's 500-member Parliament
responded with a round of applause.
   Plans for a new national security agency, including a secret
police force, had drawn bitter opposition from members of Modrow's
coalition government as well as from the opposition.
   The reformist Communist government last month abolished the
hated Stasi secret police, but Modrow had said some kind of
internal security force was needed to guard against alleged dangers
from neo-Nazis and others.
   Opposition leaders said decisions on the sensitive issues of
internal security should wait until a democratically elected
government takes over.
   Modrow still faces further challenges to his leadership before
the elections, including demands of proof that the old secret
police apparatus has been fully dismantled.
   In addition, some of the non-Communist partners in the coalition
government oppose election rules drawn up by the Communists, which
they say could hurt the non-Communists' chances of winning in the
electon.
   ``If the law is passed in its present form, our party may not be
able to stay in the govermnent,'' Christian Democratic Chairman
Lothar de Maiziere said in an interview today with the West Berlin
radio station RIAS.
   The Liberal Democrats, another coalition partner, also oppose
the draft election law.
   Objections focus on a provision of the law that would ban
campaign aid from outside the country. The provision is aimed at
West Germans already gearing up to help the opposition and
non-Communist parties.
   As Parliament met today to discuss the country's woes, more than
200 East Berlin taxi drivers drove in a line to the Parliament
building, honking their horns to show their displeasure with the
government.
   Disputes have been common in East Germany since a pro-democracy
movement ousted hard-line Communist leader Erich Honecker on Oct.
18, touching off a wave of reforms that led to the formation of the
coalition government.
   Thursday evening, 3,000 pro-democracy supporters staged a noisy
protest outside Parliament. ``Down with the Communists!'' and ``Out
with the Stasi!'' they chanted. Stasi, a shortened form of
Staatssicherheit, or ``state security,'' is the popular name for
the secret police force.
   Demonstrators lowered several East German flags from their poles
and ripped out the Communist hammer-and-compass symbol from the
center.
   Thursday's disclosure that the key figure in an East German
financial scandal was a high-ranking secret police officer seemed
likely to increase friction.
   The man, Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, was a colonel in the
East German secret police.
   He is wanted in East Germany on charges of embezzlement, after
reportedly absconding with tens of millions of dollars that ended
up in Swiss bank acounts, says Dietrich Schultz, West Berlin's
prosecutor general.
   Schalck-Golodowski had been the government's chief foreign
trader, and the official in charge of bringing in badly needed
Western currency.
   Schultz cited Schalck-Golodkowski's secret police role as the
reason for the West Berlin prosecutor's refusal to extradite him
back to East Germany, where treason charges and a death sentence
are a possibility.
   Schalck-Golodkowski, who also allegedly ran a ring that
illegally sold weapons to countries in Africa, South America and
the Middle East, turned himself in to West Berlin authorities on
Dec. 6. He was freed on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Grazing Fees on Forest Service Land to be Reduced Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fees for grazing livestock on public land
administered by the Forest Service will be reduced slightly
beginning March 1, the Agriculture Department agency said today.
   F. Dale Robertson, chief of the Forest Service, said monthly
fees for grazing stock on national forests in 15 Western states
will be lowered five cents to $1.81 per ``head month.''
   The decrease will apply to forests in Arizona, California,
Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North
Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and
Wyoming.
   A ``head month'' was defined as a month's use and occupancy of
public range by one weaned or adult cow, bull, steer, heifer,
horse, burro or mule; or five sheep or goats.
   The fee reduction is expected to apply to more than 9,000
livestock owners who hold grazing permits for national forest land.
More than 1.9 million animals, mostly cattle, are grazed on the
ranges each year. Fees are expected to total about $10.2 million.
   Grazing fees are determined by a formula that takes into
consideration the ``fair market value'' of forage involved, along
with changes in private gazing rates, beef cattle prices and the
costs of livestock production.
   Officials said the current reduction is based primarily on
increases in cattle production costs, which in 1989 exceeded gains
in both beef cattle prices and the private grazing rates.
   No fees were announced for 1990 grazing on national grasslands
in nine states. A Forest Service spokeswoman, Diane Hitchings, said
those will be announced in a week or so.

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee said today the U.S. invasion of Panama was a military
success but future incursions into Third World nations may not be
as easy.
   ``Looking at the military operation alone, the men and women who
planned and executed Operation Just Cause can take justified pride.
It was a success,'' Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said in a report to
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.
   The committee chairman said U.S. forces who invaded Panama in
the early hours of Dec. 20 were fortunate because the Panamanian
Defense Forces took few hostages and their leader, Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, did not stay and fight.
   ``We were just plain lucky,'' Aspin said later at a news
conference where he disclosed that at the start of the invasion
Panamanian forces took control of 347 passengers aboard a Brazilian
airliner that had arrived at Torrijos International Airport.
   The Panamanians, however, were talked out of holding the
passengers as hostages, Aspin said.
   Noriega, who eluded U.S. capture for several days, sought asylum
in the Vatican embassy in Panama City on Christmas Eve. He turned
himself over to U.S. authorities last week and is being held in
Miami on drug-trafficking charges.
   Aspin said Noriega had information ahead of time on the U.S.
invasion but evidence indicates he did not act upon it. The
lawmaker suggested that indications of an invasion had become so
routine that Noriega discounted them.
   ``The very success of Operation Just Cause will lead many, I
suspect, to tout it as a model to be applied to other situations,''
Aspin said. ``I believe, however, that there are several aspects of
the Panamanian operation that probably are unique and limit its
applicability.''
   Among the advantages, according to Aspin, was the knowledge of
Panama and its people based on long U.S. involvement there; the
presence of about 13,000 U.S. troops already stationed in the
country and the lengthy time the United States had to practice for
the invasion.
   Aspin, who traveled to Panama on Jan. 4-5 with a congressional
delegation, said that despite recent criticism there were no major
failures of U.S. intelligence.
   The administration came under criticism shortly after the
invasion and while Noriega was still at large that intelligence
efforts failed because the Panamanian leader had not been captured.
   Aspin said these were not intelligence failures, but ``rather
they are typical of the risks associated with any military
operation.''
   ``U.S. military planners did not fail to anticipate their
possible occurrence, but proceeded with Operation Just Cause,
hedging _ reasonably, I believe _ against the risk they might
occur,'' he said.
   However, Aspin said there were errors as U.S. military planners
underestimated the determination of the Panamanian Defense Forces
and the paramilitary Dignity Battalions.
   He also said the U.S. Southern Command in Panama City should
have anticipated that Noriega would flee to the Vatican embassy in
light of the fact that 30 of his supporters had already done so.
   Despite the success militarily, Aspin said, significant problems
remain, including reviving the Panamanian economy, creating a new
security force, ending Panama's role in drug trafficking and
establishing a stable, democratic government.
   ``Obviously, the United States must play a big part in making
this happen; otherwise, its military intervention will have been in
vain,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Wholesale prices jumped 0.7 percent in
December to boost inflation for 1989 to 4.8 percent, the worst
showing in eight years, the government said today.
   The gain in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index for
finished goods, one stop short of retail, topped last year's rate
of 4.0 percent and was more than double the 1987 rate of 2.2
percent.
   It marked the third consecutive year that price increases have
accelerated and was the steepest rise since the index shot up 7.1
percent in 1981.
   For December and all of 1989, inflation was driven largely by
steep gains in energy prices.
   In advance of the report, most analysts were expecting a more
moderate gain of 0.5 percent. Stock prices, unsettled by inflation
worries and by market declines in Tokyo and London, dropped
sharply, with the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling 43.73
points to 2,716.90 in the first 90 minutes of trading.
   In a separate report, the Commerce Department said retail sales
rose a disappointing 0.2 percent in December, producing an annual
gain of 5 percent. That was barely ahead of inflation and was the
most lackluster showing in seven years.
   ``We're starting the year with the worst of both possible
worlds: inflation accelerating and growth slowing,'' said economist
David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co. Inc., a government
securities dealer in New York. ``Normally what you want is strong
growth and low inflation, if you can get it.''
   The wholesale price number for 1989 masked a roller-coaster ride
that had prices rising at better than a 9 percent annual rate in
the first five months of the year, slowing to a 1 percent annual
rate from June through November and then soaring again in December.
   Prices had fallen 0.1 percent in November and risen 0.4 percent
in October.
   Energy prices increased 1.4 percent for the month and 9.6
percent for the entire year, compared with a 3.6 percent drop in
1988.
   The deep freeze that gripped much of the nation last month
helped boost fuel oil prices 7.1 percent and natural gas costs 1.6
percent. Gasoline prices were unchanged after falling 7.1 percent
in November.
   For the year, fuel oil was up 33.9 percent, the biggest rise
since 1979 when fuel oil prices rose 70.5 percent. Gasoline rose
9.2 percent for the year and natural gas, 3.5 percent.
   The cold also played a role in food costs last month, which rose
a moderate 0.5 percent overall. Prices for vegetables shot up 4.1
percent and for eggs, 4.7 percent. But those gains were somewhat
offset by substantial price drops for pasta, pork, turkey and
shortening and cooking oil.
   Food inflation for the year was 5.0 percent, an improvement over
5.7 percent in 1988, when a summer drought seared the nation's farm
regions.
   For the year, egg prices were up 40.9 percent, on top of a 42.1
percent rise in 1988; pork prices rose 19.4 percent and dairy
products, 14.3 percent. However, fresh fruit declined 10.4 percent;
chicken, 8.9 percent; and fish, 5.7 percent.
   The inflation rate excluding the volatile food and energy
sectors shot up 0.6 percent last month, in large part because of a
4.5 percent jump in tobacco prices. Auto prices rose a brisk 0.6
percent, but for the year were up only 2.1 percent because of weak
sales.
   Economists often look to the prices of goods other than food and
energy for an indication of underlying inflation pressures. For the
year, that sector rose 4.2 percent, down slightly from 4.3 percent
in 1988.
   Economists attribute the stability outside food and energy to
the policies of the Federal Reserve Board, which slowed the economy
with higher interest rates until June. Since then, the central bank
has been allowing rates to fall in an effort to stop the country
from toppling into a recession.
   Most analysts expect the sluggishness to persist well into the
first half of this year, taking the edge off price hikes.
   The various changes in December left the price index for
finished goods at 115.3 percent of its 1982 base. That meant that a
hypothetical marketbasket of goods cost $115.30 in December, up
from $110 a year earlier.
   At earlier stages of the production process, prices fell 0.1
percent at the intermediate level, rising 2.4 percent for the year.
At the crude level, they shot up 1.8 percent last month, the
steepest rise since March, and 6.9 percent for the year.
   The annual increase at the crude level was supported largely by
a 35 percent rise in petroleum prices, the sharpest in 10 years.
   An example of the three stages would be bread for finished
goods, flour for intermediate goods and wheat for crude goods.

<TEXT>
   Police swept across the capital on
anti-drug raids and captured nine suspected members of the cocaine
cartel based here, including a top member wanted in the United
States, authorities said today.
   The suspect, Jesus Emilio Zapata, and the eight other alleged
members of the Bogota cartel were arrested in one of 20 raids in
the capital Thursday.
   Police said they also seized five cars, an unspecified quantity
of weapons, communications equipment, and records of bank accounts
holding $60 million.
   A police statement said Zapata led the international operations
of the drug-trafficking group, based on a farm near the northern
Bogota suburb of Suba.
   U.S. authorities want to prosecute Zapata on drug-trafficking
charges, the statement said. However, his name is not on a list the
U.S. Justice Department prepared last year of the top 12 Colombian
drug traffickers it is seeking.
   The government of President Virgilio Barco has already
extradited 11 drug suspects to the United States since it
intensified a campaign against the cocaine cartels in August.
   It is not known if the Bogota cartel has been operating in
cooperation with either of the country's two main cocaine cartels,
which are based in the cities of Medellin and Cali.
   Earlier this week, police arrested Joaquin Oswaldo Gallo
Chamorro, who allegedly directed the Medellin cartel's Atlantic
coast operations after the former director, Jose Rafael Abello
Silva, was arrested and extradited to the United States on Oct. 29.
   Also today, the government announced a new surtax on personal
and corporate income to help finance its war on the drug cartels.
   Colombian businesses and individuals will pay a surtax of 5
percent of their 1989 income tax, according to a presidential
decree.
   The government estimates the surtax will increase its revenues
by up to $33 million. The decree said only the wealthiest
businesses and individuals would pay the tax.

   Classes resumed today at Oakland
University after a one-day shutdown caused by three small pipe bomb
explosions.
   Students reported to their 8 a.m. classes, said a university
receptionist who declined to give her name.
   No arrests were made and no motive had been determined in the
three Wednesday night bombings, athough police said a former
student in custody on other charges was being questioned after
materials to make pipe bombs was found in his apartment.
   One explosion occurred in the Kresge Library and the others in
nearby parking lots. No injuries and only minimal property damage
were reported.
   The 12,000-student school 25 miles north of Detroit was closed
Thursday.
   ``There is no reason to believe there is anything other than
these incidents,'' university spokesman Jim Llewellyn said. ``They
had no timers. They had to light them and run like hell. We have no
reason to believe the whole campus is full of bombs.''
   Authorities were questioning a 19-year-old Pontiac man after
arresting him on stolen property charges. They were seeking the
man's 21-year-old housemate.
   State police investigating the Oct. 30 theft of ski equipment
and clothing from Mount Holly Ski Area obtained a warrant to search
the 19-year-old's apartment in Pontiac. They arrested him after
allegedly finding stolen goods and material to make pipe bombs,
Pontiac Detective Sgt. Gary Muir said.
   The unidentified man attended the university during the fall
semester but was not registered for the current term, Llewellyn
said. He said university records did not indicate any problems
involving the former student.
   The man faced arraignment today on charges of receiving and
concealing stolen property and other unspecified charges, Muir said.

   A paroled child murderer has been charged
with a ninth murder count in a string of slayings and police
reportedly are investigating possible links to the deaths of five
women in Ohio and western Pennsylvania.
   Arthur J. Shawcross was charged Thursday in Wayne County Court
with killing a prostitute, Elizabeth A. Gibson, 29, of Rochester,
whose body was found Nov. 27 in a wooded area of Wayne County, east
of Rochester.
   Shawcross had earlier been charged with eight other slayings. A
Monroe County grand jury is set to consider evidence from two other
slayings next week.
   Police were investigating similarities between those 11 slayings
and the murders of five prostitutes or suspected prostitutes in
Ohio and western Pennsylvania, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   Shawcross, 44, served 15 years in prison after confessing to the
murders of an 8-year-old girl and a 10-year-old boy in Watertown in
1972. He was paroled and moved to Rochester in 1987, about a year
before the serial killings began.
   Wayne County Judge Carmen Parenti granted Wayne County District
Attorney Steve Sirkin's request Thursday that the court deny bail
to Shawcross.
   The next court appearance was set for Jan. 30.
   Shawcross was arrested Jan. 4 after state police spotted him
sitting in a car near the frozen body of one of his alleged victims.
   Shawcross reportedly confessed to killing 11 women and told
police where to find two bodies.
   The Syracuse Post-Standard quoted unidentified police sources as
saying state police and Rochester homicide investigators met
Wednesday with police from Youngstown, Ohio, and Mercer County,
Pa., to discuss similarities between the Rochester slayings and
five murders along the Ohio-Pennsylvania border.
   The Ohio-Pennsylvania bodies were found between June and
November 1989.
   Wayne County Sheriff Richard Pisciotti said Thursday that police
around the country were in contact with Rochester officials about
possible connections to other killings, but have not yet drawn any
conclusions.

   Hundreds of people rioted in the
streets and tried to storm a government building after officials
declared the governing party's candidate had won the city's mayoral
election, a journalist said today.
   Hundreds of people were injured in the unrest, which ended today
after police and soldiers were deployed, said Fabiano Acosta, a
reporter with the local newspaper Diario de Sucre. He said there
were no deaths.
   Carlos Monasterios, of the governing Democratic Action Party,
took office Thursday while police and soldiers fired tear gas to
keep protesters from storming the hall where the swearing-in was
taking place, said Acosta.
   ``They tried to prevent him from taking o were
bottles, fistfights. A big mess,'' he said.
   Juan Marquez of the Copei Party, the country's largest
opposition partyffice, and there, originally was declared the winner in
the Dec. 3
vote. Democratic Action demanded the vote be annulled over a legal
technicality, and nation's Supreme Electoral Council met in late
December and declared Monasterios the winner.
   The elections, the first direct vote for local office in
Venezuela, have resulted in several disputed vote counts, with the
Supreme Electoral Council having to judge the winner by recounting

<HEAD>Mistrial for Couple Accused of Kidnapping Daughter from Religious
Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VISTA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mistrial was declared in the case of a
couple accused of kidnapping their adult daughter from a religious
group, because jurors couldn't resolve 13 counts against the
parents and three others.
   Superior Court Judge David Moon Jr. declared the mistrial
Thursday after the jury said it was deadlocked on kidnap, false
imprisonment and battery charges against the five defendants.
   Earle and Dorothy Brown, both 58, of Santa Cruz, were charged
with abducting their daughter, Ginger, from a northern San Diego
County parking lot in May 1988 and holding her for five days at an
Escondido home to try to ``deprogram'' her.
   Ginger Brown, then 22, had joined a small Coronado-based
religious group called Great Among Nations, which her parents say
is a cult whose leader, Benjamin Altschul, brainwashes his
followers.
   Also charged in the case were the Brown's other daughter, Holly,
25, of San Francisco; Los Angeles deprogrammer Cliff Daniels, 35;
and his associate Hank Erler, 23, of Escondido.
   All five were ordered to return to court today to face a
possible second trial on additional charges of conspiracy,
kidnapping and false imprisonment.
   A pre-trial ruling by Moon split charges against the defendants,
three of whom were acquitted Wednesday of seven other charges,
creating the need for two trials.
   Prosecutor Gary Rempel said he didn't know whether District
Attorney Ed Miller intends to press forward with the second trial
or seek to try the defendants again on the charges jurors were
unable to decide.
   ``I'm incredibly happy that even though we've had every
roadblock put up against us, they still were unable to find 12
people who would convict us,'' Holly Brown said.
   Earle and Dorothy Brown said the mistrial was a hollow victory
because their daughter remains lost to them.
   ``We loved her in the past, we love her now, and we'll never
stop loving her,'' said Earle Brown, who recently began treatment
for cancer.
   Ginger Brown said she would continue her activities with the
group and hoped her parents would understand.
   ``I am continually hoping for reconciliation. It's up to them.
I've told them how I felt,'' she said.
   She also said she had been upset with media coverage of the case.
   ``Put this story right. Show my pastor. Show his wife. Show my
dog. Show what I am, not what Cliff Daniels and his cult awareness
network wants us to be painted as,'' she said.
   The defendants admitted they took Ginger Brown, but contended
they did so to prevent greater harm to her.
   Jurors split evenly on kidnapping and battery charges against
Daniels, and deadlocked 8-4 to acquit him of false imprisonment.
   The panel voted 7-5 to acquit Earle Brown of kidnapping and 8-4
to acquit him of battery, while splitting evenly on a false
imprisonment charge against him.
   The jury also voted 10-2 to acquit Holly Brown of kidnapping and
9-3 to acquit her mother of the same charge.
   Holly and Dorothy Brown each were acquitted Wednesday of false
imprisonment and battery, while Erler was acquitted then of
kidnapping, false imprisonment and battery.

   Attackers set fire to three
houses near Durban, killing at least 13 people in violence blamed
on fighting between black factions, authorities and residents said
today.
   A group that monitors unrest for the anti-apartheid Democratic
Party said as many as 18 people may have been killed.
   Police confirmed only 13 deaths, including six boys, four girls,
and three women. However, residents said they saw 12 burned bodies
and that two other people were missing after the fires Thursday
night in the township of Cottonlands, about 15 miles north of the
port city of Durban.
   Residents said they believed the violence was caused by
factional fighting. Police said they did not know the cause.
   The monitoring group said it appeared the attackers were
supporters of United Democratic Front, a nationwide anti-apartheid
coalition. The victims lived with people linked to Inkatha, a
relatively conservative Zulu organization that has been at odds
with the Front, the monitoring group said.
   Police said two people had been arrested and that an
investigation was continuing.
   Some residents fled the township today foregedly set up by strikers.
   Authorities said workers who did not want to participate in the
strike were reportedly beaten with whips and intimidated. They said
some had their houses burned down.
   More than 20 people have died in strike-related violence since
25,000 rail employees walked off the job 10 weeks ago.

<HEAD>FBI Agent Says Loner, Not Group, May Be Responsible for Mail Bombs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An FBI agent says investigators now believe that
the Ku Klux Klan or other organized white supremacists were not
involved in last month's series of racially motivated mail bombs
that killed two people.
   FBI special agent Charles Archer of Mobile, Ala., said Thursday
that investigators have characterized the likely bomber as a man in
his 50s who is independent of any supremacist group.
   ``We feel he is 50 or older, is a loner and someone not known to
associate with any of the white hate groups,'' Archer told The
Montgomery (Ala.) Advertiser. ``We have no information that the
Klan or any similar groups are involved in any of the bombings.''
   In another development, the Atlanta Constitution reported today
that the type of string used to tie the bomb packages was made by a
textile mill that stopped making the product seven years ago, a
fact that could help investigators narrow their search for the
bomber.
   Authorities previously had indicated that white supremacists
might be behind the bombs sent to Alabama, Georgia and Florida. A
group or person using the name Americans for a Competent Federal
Judicial System claimed responsibility for the bombs that killed
U.S. Circuit Judge Robert Vance and Savannah, Ga., attorney Robert
Robinson last month and made reference to racial motivations.
   Bombs also were intercepted safely at the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court offices in Atlanta and an NAACP office in Jacksonville, Fla.
   William Hinshaw, the FBI agent coordinating the investigation in
Atlanta, cautioned against placing too much credence in any suspect
profile at this point. ``There are suspects all over the place,''
he said.
   The Birmingham (Ala.) News quoted unidentified sources as saying
federal authorities have investigated and rejected about a dozen
suspects since the first pipe bomb exploded Dec. 16, killing Vance
at his Mountain Brook, Ala., home.
   The Constitution said investigators are looking for retail
outlets that carry the cotton-and-rayon string.
   The newspaper also said investigators believe the string was
tied around the packages by an automatic string-tying machine, such
as ones found in textile, printing and mailing facilities.
   Agents are examining machines throughout the state in hopes of
finding one with remnants of the string used on the bombs, the
newspaper said.
   Meanwhile, The FBI confirmed today that threatening letters were
sent to at least five judges or courts in Ohio.
   Douglass Ogden, senior supervisor in charge of the FBI's
Columbus office, said the agency was investigating letters sent to
the Ohio Supreme Court in Columbus, to Common Pleas Court judges in
Crawford and Wyandot counties and to the 3rd and 5th Ohio District
Courts of Appeals in Lima and Canton, respectively.
   The FBI would not say whether the letters contained death
threats.
   The mail bombings will not intimidate black leaders, said Rosa
Parks, the black woman whose refusal in 1955 to give up her seat on
a bus to a white man sparked what became the civil rights movement
of the 1960s.
   ``I won't enslave myself to fear,'' Mrs. Parks said Thursday in
Tallahassee, Fla.
   Mrs. Parks, 76, said the bombings reminded her of ``the very
serious threats of lynching'' in her younger days.
   ``We had no protection whatsoever ... and I lived through
that,'' said Mrs. Parks, who was to speak today at Florida State
University's annual convocation commemorating the birthday of
Martin Luther King Jr.

   Laos will allow the United States to
search for the remains of its servicemen from the Vietnam War in
its country in all areas except those along the border with
Vietnam, a U.S. congressman said Friday.
   Nouhak Phoumsavan, president of the Laotian parliament, made the
comment in a meeting Thursday with six visiting U.S. congressmen,
said Rep. James Inhofe, R-Okla.
   Inhofe said there would be no restrictions on the methods used
to search for the missing servicemen.
   ``The words he used were `a free hand to come in and pursue
excavations and ... search in any area that they had
jurisdiction,''' he said.
   ``We can go virtually at will, from the commitment he made
yesterday,'' he said.
   ``He opened up; he said, `we will allow you to go anywhere
except for the border of Vietnam over which we don't have
jurisdiction,''' Inhofe said.
   U.S. military experts went to Laos this month to excavate two
crash sites in southern Laos. Inhofe said one of the sites appeared
to hold the wreckage of a large aircraft.
   He said it was unlikely any missing soldiers were still alive in
Laos, ``but at least we have the door open for the first time to go
and look.''
   About 2,300 Americans are listed missing from the Vietnam War,
of whom about 545 are believed to be in Laos.

<HEAD>Man Arrested in $20 Million Jewelry Theft From Saudi Royal Palace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man has been arrested in the theft of
$20 million in jewelry from the royal palace in Saudi Arabia,
allegedly stealing it from the bedroom of the prince's consort,
authorities said Friday.
   Kriangkrai Tejamoke is accused of taking the jewelry from the
palace of Prince Faisal Bin Fahad in Riyadh while working as a
cleaner there last year.
   The jewelry belonged to the prince's consort and was kept in
three unlocked safes in her bedroom, said Gen. Sawaeng Theerasawat,
Thailand's national police chief. The Saudi Embassy estimated the
jewelry was worth about $20 million.
   The Saudis want Kriangkrai returned for trial, but Thailand has
refused because it has no extradition treaty with Saudi Arabia,
Sawaeng said.
   Kriangkrai, 32, told reporters he had attempted suicide.
   ``If the police send me to Saudi Arabia, I will be killed,'' he
said. ``I do not want to be on trial there. I am very sorry.''
   Kriangkrai was charged in Thailand with robbery. If convicted,
he will face a maximum sentence of 10 years in jail.
   Kriangkrai, who was arrested Wednesday in a hotel in the
northwestern town of Mae Sot, told police he sold the jewelry for
$200,000 to gold shops in Bangkok, Lumpang and elsewhere, Sawaeng
said. About 80 percent of the jewelry has been recovered, he said.
   Sawaeng said Kriangkrai stole the jewelry from June to August,
then quit his job and returned to Thailand. Thailand began its
manhunt for Kriangkrai on the request of the Saudi interior
minister in December, he said.

<HEAD>Loss Of Government Aid In Madison Parish Will Make Hard Times
Harder</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Of all the rural parishes suffering through
Louisiana's hard economic times, Madison Parish is among the
hardest hit. Boarded-up stores line the streets in the parish seat
and repossessed farms cover the countryside.
   Unemployment is 16 percent. The poverty rate is 42.7 percent in
the parish about 180 miles up the Mississippi River from New
Orleans.
   Nevertheless, as of Thursday, the parish had $22,000 less in
federal money to deal with its problems.
   Madison was one of 126 U.S. counties cut from the Emergency Food
and Shelter National Board Program, and in Tallulah, the parish
seat, Mayor Zelma C. Wyche can't understand it.
   ``If any area needs help it's Madison Parish,'' said Wyche. ``We
see stories about people in San Francisco getting help after the
earthquake and people who were hit by Hurricane Hugo getting help.
Well, let me tell you something, those tragedies only hit every 20
years or so. Mine stays here forever.''
   The parish lost its eligibility because it had fewer than the
required 1,000 unemployed people, according to the program's
figures.
   The figures showed 883 jobless people. Wyche said he was sure
the figures were wrong.
   ``We're going to protest. We're going to try to get a survey to
prove it's wrong. We don't have people sleeping in vacant buildings
or cardboard boxes, but we've got a lot of poor people barely
getting by,'' he said.
   Counties don't apply for grants. Rather, they are told if a
formula qualifies them for money, and then must come up with a
spending plan. The grant money may be used to buy and distribute
food, run homeless shelters, assist with mortgages or help the poor
pay energy bills.
   ``We have a good need in this parish,'' said Pierre A. Scott,
president of the Council on Aging. ``Madison Parish can use any
money it can get. This is a farming community and when farming is
bad everything is bad. And I can tell you, farming has been
definitely bad lately.''
   Madison Parish, made up of rolling fields and woods across the
Mississippi River from Vicksburg, Miss., is home to just over
16,000 people.
   ``It's beautiful country and when the economy was good we had a
lot of happy people here. There's some of the best hunting and
fishing in the world right here. The problem is that's about all
there is now,'' said Sheriff B.B. Harmon.
   He said one of his deputies works seven days a week serving
seizure papers.
   ``There's not much business in town. The stores are boarded up.
It looks like a western ghost town,'' Harmon said. ``You know, if I
wanted to buy a dress shirt I'd have to get some old thing at
Bill's Dollar Store or drive to Vicksburg and that's 20 miles away.
The kids are all moving out of town. There's not even a picture
show. The closest one is 20 miles to the east or 65 miles to the
west.''
   The loss of the money will mean even more hardship, Scott said.
   ``There aren't any real well-off folks in Madison Parish,'' he
said. ``We'll try to take up the slack and the churches will help
out some more, but mainly what you'll have is poor people helping
the ones in poverty.''

   A state appeals court says a legal doctrine that
let victims recover stolen property forcibly should be buried with
the rest of the Old West's frontier justice.
   But a lawyer whose client was convicted of armed robbery says
her client was just doing what police are too busy to do when he
grabbed a bicycle he claims had been stolen from him two years
before.
   ``It isn't the Old West that's dying here,'' says the attorney,
Carol Carrigan. ``It's common sense.''
   The case arose in 1987 when Dale Ira Schaefer, then a
32-year-old landscape worker with a record of petty thefts,
burglary and assaults, spotted a bicycle at a convenience store in
Phoenix.
   Schaefer claimed the bicycle had been stolen from him two years
before, displayed a pistol, and took the bicycle from Charles
Milton, according to trial testimony.
   Milton said the bicycle, originally worth about $200, had been
purchased by a relative at a yard sale for $25 about two years
earlier.
   A jury convicted Schaefer of armed robbery and Judge Armando de
Leon sentenced him to 10{ years in prison.
   Schaefer appealed, saying de Leon should have instructed the
jury on the ``claim of right defense,'' an old doctrine that says
the owner of property can take it back by force if it is stolen.
   Court of Appeals Judge Rudolph Gerber said Thursday in a
decision upholding de Leon that the claim of right defense was
recognized ``more that a half-century ago when self-help remedies
were an accepted part of Arizona's frontier history and culture.''
   Revisions to the state's criminal code since then suggest that
the doctrine is outdated, Gerber said.
   ``From a public policy standpoint, the claim of right defense
remains anachronistic: it encourages disputants to resolve disputes
on the streets through violence instead of through the judicial
system,'' he added.
   ``I just don't think the authorities are available on a 24-hour,
on-call basis for this type of situation,'' Ms. Carrigan replied.
   Gerber's decision ``means you have to find your nearest police
officer and hope to heck it (property) hasn't walked away in the
meantime,'' she said. ``As a taxpayer, I find it rather offensive
paying $30,000 a year to keep in prison a person, a citizen, who
takes back his own property.''

   A former criminal justice student was arrested
for allegedly trying to smuggle 42 heroin-filled condoms he had
swallowed.
   Gosie Mbachu, 26, of Houston was arrested Wednesday night at
Houston Intercontinental Airport.
   U.S. Customs spokeswoman Judy Turner said Mbachu consented to a
hospital X-ray after agents stopped him as he arrived from London.
   After the X-rays, the condoms were flushed from his system. Ms.
Turner said they contained one pound of 90 percent pure heroin
worth about $770,000 on the street.
   Mbachu, a criminal justice student at Texas Southern University
in the mid-1980s, said he works as a security guard. He was held in
the Harris County Jail pending arraignment on charges of possession
with intent to distribute and introducing narcotics into the
country, Ms. Turner said.

   A federal judge has ruled that the city may save
the building where Margaret Mitchell wrote much of ``Gone With the
Wind'' from destruction.
   Developers wanted to tear down the 78-year-old apartment house,
which Miss Mitchell labeled ``The Dump,'' but then-Mayor Andrew
Young refused to sign the demolition permit in 1988. The house was
on the city's list of protected, historic landmarks.
   Developers sued the city and Young and for an ``unconstitutional
taking of property,'' and demanded $136,000 damages and $1,000 a
day until the permit was signed.
   Citing a 1978 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, U.S. District Judge
Horace T. Ward ruled Wednesday that the city ordinance and
protection were ``a permissible and legitimate government goal.''
   The house, where Miss Mitchell lived from 1926 to 1932, violates
city housing codes. But a preservation group, Mitchell House Inc.,
has sought services and material to renovate it and turn it into a
museum.

<HEAD>Moe: Minnesota `Brainpower State' Sign Is Insult to Visitors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A new highway sign proclaiming Minnesota
``the brainpower state'' insults tourists, the Senate majority
leader said.
   ``It's as if we said to them: `Welcome to Minnesota. Too bad
you're not smart enough to live here,''' Roger Moe said Thursday in
a letter to Gov. Rudy Perpich.
   Transportation Commissioner Len Levine said only one sign, on
Interstate 94 near Hudson, Wis., has the slogan. It was added about
three weeks ago to the Minnesota-shaped welcome sign, which also
contains the traditional reference to Minnesota as the ``Land of
10,000 Lakes,'' Levine said.
   Perpich, who is seeking an unprecedented fourth term, often
refers to Minnesota as ``the brainpower state'' to tout its
educational achievements. Moe is expected to announce he is
challenging Perpich later this month.
   Moe said that when he first heard about the sign idea he thought
it was a joke. Now he wonders what visitors will think.
   ``Do they think we're so arrogant we have to brag about how
smart we are? Or do they think it's just a public relations gimmick
by people pretending to be better than they really are? In either
case it's silly, a waste of taxpayers' money and an insult to
tourists from other states we want to see return to Minnesota.''
   Moe asked Perpich to order Levine to remove the sign ``before
our neighboring states demand proof of your claim.''
   Perpich had no immediate comment, Ray Bohn, Perpich's spokesman,
said.
   Levine said the suggestion to advertise the state's educational
status was made a few months ago by a transportation official from
another state. Levine sent the idea along to officials of his
department who oversee highway signs, and they recommended the
brainpower slogan be tested on one sign, he said.
   Motorists are being surveyed about their reaction to the sign,
Levine said. ``After a few days of getting the reaction, we will
then be able to decide whether that slogan should stay up, whether
another should be added, whether the shape of the sign should be
changed, whether it should remain the same, or whether `Land of
10,000 Lakes' should be changed,'' Levine said.

   Authorities have charged 38 people,
including former allies of President Yoweri Museveni, with plotting
to overthrow him.
   Ordered held for trial in the chief magistrate's court were 19
military officers and a like number of civilians.
   Among them were four former officials of the Uganda Federal
Democratic Movement, a guerrilla group which fought alongside
Museveni's National Resistance Army against former President Milton
Obote, who was deposed in 1985.
   The four are Peter Polly Mukiibi, 51, former secretary general
of the guerrilla group; Perez Mukiibi, 51, former head of the
movement's political department; Dr. Martin Kato, 52; and Vincent

   More than 2,000 paratroopers returning
from duty in the Panama invasion jumped from planes today in a
spectacular and triumphant homecoming cheered by family and friends.
   A roar erupted from several thousand spectators as the
parachutes popped open and the soldiers floated 800 feet to the
ground from 20 C-141 transport planes promptly at 8 a.m.
   The 82nd Airborne Division paratroopers had jumped into Panama
during the Dec. 20 invasion that resulted in the arrest of
Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega on federal drug charges.
   The soldiers, clad in battle gear and with black and brown
camouflage paint on their faces, gathered their parachutes after
landing on Sicily Drop Zone, a huge field on the sprawling Fort
Bragg base.
   Lt. Gen. Carl Stiner, who led the 82nd Airborne in the invasion,
was the first to jump.
   ``Everyone knew there would be personal danger but not a single
one hesitated to go or to enter a battle,'' Stiner said during a
welcoming speech. ``You would have been very proud of your
soldiers. ... No one has ever been more disciplined under fire or
more mature in carrying out their duties.''
   Asked why the soldiers returned home by jumping out of planes
instead of walking off them, base spokesman Capt. Lewis Boone said:
``Their primary means of deployment is jumping. They will jump
whenever possible _ over here, over there, anywhere.''
   Crowds were brought to the drop zone before dawn for the
welcoming. A military band played ``God Bless America'' and
marching songs while waiting for the airplanes. Base officials
estimated that 3,000 to 4,000 spectators watched the return, said
Staff Sgt. Cindy Darst.
   ``It's great. I'm trying not to cry,'' said Audrey Frazier, who
was waiting for her fiance, Sgt. Lee Andre Perkins. ``It's just a
great feeling to see them finally touch the ground.''
   Karie Wilkinson, 20, who also was engaged to a paratrooper, said
she planned a quiet welcome with Pfc. William Short, 22, and would
open Christmas presents and gifts for their Jan. 26 wedding.
   Ms. Wilkinson said she had been worried that the wedding would
have to be postponed.
   Staff Sgt Vicki Zamora, 27, one of two women soldiers listed on
the division's manifest, worked as an imagery analyst in Panama and
was stationed in a building that was under mortar fire the day
before she arrived.
   She was greeted by her husband, Gus Zamora, 34, and their three
children. While her children pulled at her uniform and told what
they got for Christmas, she said she felt good about leaving the
children because ``they were in good hands being with their daddy.''
   Asked if women should fight in combat, she replied: ``We all
train as a team and we need to fight as a team.''
   Strong winds forecast for this morning had threatened to cancel
the jump, according to post officials, who said a landing at Pope
Air Force Base was the alternative. The National Weather Service
forecast called for winds of 20 to 25 mph, but wind was calm in
time for the jump.
   The 82nd Airborne Division troops returning today conducted a
night parachute assault onto Tocumen-Torrijos airfield east of
Panama City, secured the airfield, and moved out within hours to
secure other targets, officials said.
   On hand for the ceremony were Gen. Carl E. Vuono, the Army chief
of staff; Gen. Edwin H. Burba Jr., Forces Command commander; and
U.S. Rep. Charles G. Rose III, D-N.C.

<HEAD>Portuguese Leader Suggests Greater Role For His Country In Angola
Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Portugal's Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva
said Friday he suggested to President Bush that Portugal assume an
active role in reviving U.S.-backed peace-making efforts in Angola.
   Cavaco Silva also said he had told Bush it was ``completely
unrealistic'' for the United States to refuse to recognize the
government of Angola's President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos. The
United States is one of only three countries, along with Israel and
South Africa, which have withheld recognition of Angola's
Soviet-backed government, he said.
   Talking with reporters over breakfast, Cavaco Silva said he had
told Bush at their two meetings Thursday that Portugal favors
direct negotiations between the Angolan government and the
U.S.-armed UNITA rebels.
   ``We don't believe too much in mediation,'' he said, although
Portugal had supported the U.S.-backed initiative that appointed
Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko as a mediator between the
warring Angolan parties last June.
   Mobutu's mediation efforts have stalled repeatedly, while a
cease-fire agreed to by the sides last summer broke down.
Government troops last month launched a military offensive against
UNITA forces in southern Angola, and a meeting of eight African
leaders scheduled this week in Luanda to discuss the peace talks
was canceled.
   Both dos Santos and UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi have apparently
lost confidence in Mobutu's neutrality and ability to bridge their
differences.
   Cavaco Silva said ``Portugal knows the area best,'' having ruled
it as part of its network of African colonies for 500 years. ``We
can help, we're accepted by both sides.''
   The United States, too, can help the process along by adopting a
less partisan stand, the Portuguese leader said. Dos Santos asked
that Cavaco Silva urge Bush to be more ``neutral,'' the prime
minister said.
   Dos Santos is expected here next month at the invitation of
several dozen members of Congress critical of the administration's
support for Savimbi. ``We can't ignore dos Santos, it's totally
unrealistic,'' Cavaco Silva said.
   He said ``there didn't seem to be much difference'' between
Portugal's views and those expressed by Bush, although a U.S.
official told reporters Thursday that the two leaders did not
agreed on everything in discussing Angola.
   The administration, under pressure from conservatives in
Congress, has been funneling at least $40 million in covert aid to
Savimbi's forces annually in recent years, mostly through Zaire.
   Cavaco Silva said he told Bush that in order to bring the sides
to the negotiating table, ``it is necessary to reduce all
interference from abroad.''
   The United States contends the Soviet Union continues to arm the
Angolan military and to maintain advisers there to train government
forces. Earlier this week, the State Department criticized the
Soviets for their support of the latest military offensive.
   But Cavaco Silva said the Soviets have reduced their presence in
Angola, along with the pullout of the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops
that began last year, and is advancing ahead of schedule toward its
completion later this year.
   The Portuguese leader left Washington Friday to meet with U.N.
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, before heading home.

<TEXT>
   A Laos court has convicted 38
Vietnamese of infiltrating Laos en route to launching attacks in
their homeland, and they were sentenced to up to 15 years in jail,
it was reported Friday.
   They were part of a group of 68 armed Vietnamese exiles whom
Laotian forces intercepted after they intruded into southern
Saravane province in August 1989, said the KPL agency monitored in
Bangkok.
   At Thursday's trial in the Supreme People's Court in Vientiane,
the defense lawyer asked for clemency ``saying the accused were
simply agents of the Vietnamese reactionary organization whose
leader and headquarters are in California.''
   All were found guilty of ``intruding into territory, encroaching
upon the sovereignty of Laos, carrying out espionage activities,
and sabotaging the peace and tranquility of the Lao people.''
   The agency said the group commander, Capt. Tran Quang Do, 39,
and his deputy, Le Van Tien, were sentenced to 15 years
imprisonment. The others received terms ranging from six to 12
years.
   The agency said Do had served in the U.S.-backed South Vietnam
army before it was defeated by the communists in April 1975.
   The official Vientiane radio said Thursday the Vietnamese had
crossed the Mekong River into Saravane from Thailand's Ubon
Ratchathani Province. Local army and militia units attacked them,
and the 38 surrendered while the rest were ``put out of action,''
it said.
   Laos and Vietnam, close Communist allies, have accused Thailand
of giving sanctuary to anti-Communist insurgents and the United
States of funding them.

<HEAD>Federal Hospital Mortality Rate Study Flawed, Researchers Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SARAH NORDGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A report on hospital mortality rates doesn't take
into account how sick people are when they're admitted, and
therefore high rates may unnecessarily scare patients, say
researchers who analyzed the study.
   The widely used federal report published by the Health Care
Financing Administration uses a computer analysis of Medicare
claims at each of the nation's nearly 6,000 hospitals. The results
compare the mortality rates of each institution.
   Researchers publishing in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association say the HCFA results are misleading.
   ``Without knowing that (the severity of illness), no physician
could make a good judgment about that patient's prognosis,'' lead
researcher Jesse Green said Thursday. ``If a physician can't do it,
there's no way a computer can do it.''
   Green's study said the report may also have an inherent bias
against public and teaching hospitals, since those hospitals treat
more severely ill patients.
   The federal report, called ``Medicare Hospital Mortality
Information,'' has been compiled for the past three years by the
HCFA, an arm of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
It uses statistical techniques to compare predicted hospital
mortality rates with the actual number of deaths.
   The most recent 14-volume report, published last month,
indicated that 3.4 percent of the nation's hospitals, or 196
hospitals, had higher-than-expected death rates in 1988.
   Federal officials have cautioned each year that the report
should not be used as the sole measure of a hospital's quality. The
latest report used revised calculations _ including such factors as
whether a patient was admitted through a hospital's emergency room
_ to more accurately account for the severity of illness.
   But Green and his colleagues at New York University Medical
Center said the report is still seriously misleading.
   ``The improvements are worthwhile, but they should not be called
`severity of illness adjustments' because they are not based on
clinical information about how sick the patient was,'' said Green,
who heads the medical center's Department of Health Policy Research.
   Louis B. Hays, acting HCFA administrator, on Thursday disputed
Green's study, saying the report ``is not perfect, but it reflects,
frankly, the best opinions of the community out there of health
care statisticians and researchers.
   ``The study published in JAMA is of little value to us,'' he
said.
   Hays said refinements in the morbidity report have made it an
increasingly reliable tool for consumers.
   Green's study examined the admission records of 34,252 Medicare
patients discharged from 13 hospitals nationwide in 1986. The
patients were divided into five diagnostic categories and
classified according to how seriously ill they were at the time of
admission.
   ``The number of instances of a mortality rate above the HCFA's
predicted range were reduced to chance levels when patient severity
of illness was taken into account,'' the authors wrote.
   Hays said back-up studies his agency have conducted which
include measures for severity of illness confirm the findings in
the federal report.
   But Green said the government's report should not be used by
patients to decide where they should be hospitalized ``because the
effect of severity of illness is much larger than the effect of
quality. I think that it unnecessarily creates fear in the mind of
consumers.''

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev promised
a national vote on republics' right to secede, but Lithuanian
leaders today rejected it as a ``trap'' and said Gorbachev had
underestimated their republic's desire for freedom.
   Gorbachev, meanwhile, traveled to the Lithuanian countryside in
an effort to stop Lithuania's independence campaign.
   The president, his voice cracking with emotion at times,
predicted on Thursday night that Lithuanians would opt to stay in
the Soviet Union once they realized the difficulty of secession and
the hardships it would place on ethnic groups in their republic.
   ``Now, people don't know what awaits them,'' he said. ``They've
been told fairy tales, Russian fairy tales and Lithuanian fairy
tales.''
   His comments were broadcast today on Lithuanian television.
   The Kremlin leader is in the middle of what so far has been a
futile campaign to stop the secession movement, probably the worst
political crisis Gorbachev has faced in his nearly five years in
office.
   Gorbachev noted the Soviet Constitution guarantees each of the
country's 15 republics the right to secede and disclosed that the
first draft of a law detailing the process of secession has been
written.
   The leader of Lithuania's pro-independence Sajudis movement,
Vytautas Landsbergis, today said of the announcement, ``It's a
propaganda trap.''
   ``If we get entangled in the mechanism of seceding from the
Soviet Union, we automatically act as if we were a legal part of
the Soviet Union.''
   His group maintains that Lithuania's incorporation into the
Soviet Union in 1940 was illegal. Lithuania's Communist Party
already has declared itself independent from the central Communist
Party.
   Gorbachev promised a national discussion and referendum on the
law, which would require republics to hold their own votes on
breaking away.
   ``I favor the existence of a mechanism (to secede) to stop this
speculation ... let there be a choice by the people,'' Gorbachev
said.
   The audience broke into applause and broad smiles.
   He gave no clear details about the draft law but implied it
would require a republic considering secession to make detailed
plans, set out the exact costs, both financial and in terms of
human dislocation, and then hold an election.
   ``You have relations with all the republics, with all states.
You must resolve all the problems, such as what to do with the
people who want to leave, and who will get the homes and the jobs
they leave behind,'' Gorbachev said.
   Instead of euphoric calls for freedom, Gorbachev said, people
should be given concrete information on how secession would take
place and ``what they have to live through.''
   ``They have to know what (secession) is. Then let them decide,''
he added.
   He predicted Lithuanians would reject secession in favor of a
loose Soviet federation, saying they would never feel free if their
lives improved at the expense of ethnic Russians, Poles and other
non-Lithuanians who live in the republic.
   When the audience objected, Gorbachev's voice rose. ``It will
never happen,'' he nearly shouted. ``You are a civilized people.
Your conscience won't let you.''
   Kazimieras Motieka, a Sajudis leader, said Gorbachev had badly
miscalculated Lithuanians.
   ``No economic blockades, no threats, no gloomy predictions will
stop the Lithuanian people,'' Motieka told a news conference.
   Soviet dictator Josef Stalin absorbed Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia in 1940 under a secret agreement with Nazi Germany.
   The main goal of Gorbachev's three-day visit is to reverse the
Lithuanian Communist Party's decision last month to break with the
national party.
   He began Thursday by plunging into crowds in Vilnius, the
capital, and debating Lithuanians one on one.
   Most Lithuanians greeted their president with warm smiles and
handshakes, but they appeared unmoved by his plea. About 300,000
jammed the central square of Vilnius late Thursday in a candlelight
demonstration for independence.
   Gorbachev today went to Siauliai, 125 miles northwest of
Vilnius, to visit a collective farm and a television parts factory,
the official Tass news agency said.
   Siauliai, home to a large concentration of Soviet armed forces
personnel, is closed to foreigners, including reporters.
   Gorbachev also planned to meet with a rival Communist Party
organization created by mostly ethnic non-Lithuanians who profess
loyalty to Moscow and the Soviet Communist Party that Gorbachev
heads.
   Gorbachev appeared to be in good spirits when he arrived
Thursday, but he grew increasingly somber as the day wore on.
   Lithuanian television showed Gorbachev in a confrontation with
an elderly worker at a Vilnius factory, who wore a sign saying
``not more rights, but full independence.''
   Gorbachev told the man Lithuania was provincial before it became
part of the Soviet Union, and since then has become a ``developed
country.''
   The worker replied: ``And do you know how many Lithuanians were
deported in the 1940s, and how many died?''
   A visibly exasperated Gorbachev said: ``I don't want to talk
anymore with this old man. If such attitudes and slogans exist in
Lithuania, then very hard times are coming.''
   There were signs of local defiance toward centralized Soviet
rule elsewhere Thursday.
   In Armenia, the legislature amended the republic's constitution
to give itself veto over national laws it sees as conflicting with
Armenia's interests, said Yerevan activist Rafael Popoyan.
   In Latvia, lawmakers followed the lead of their Lithuanian
colleagues and amended the constitution to create a multiparty
system, the evening TV news program ``Vremya'' reported. The
amendments end the Communist Party's constitutional guarantee of
political power and allow Latvians to form rival parties ``that do
not advocate overthrowing the existing state system or other
anti-constitutional goals,'' the report said.

   The new provisional government today
held a memorial for those who died in the revolution, and thousands
of protesters shouted ``Kill the Communists!'' and booed Romania's
new leaders at a rally.
   On Thursday, French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas became the
first high-ranking Western official to visit since Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's ouster, and he discussed plans to help
Romania's new government.
   Interim President Ion Iliescu declared a day of mourning for
those who died in the army-backed popular revolution that toppled
Ceausescu last month.
   ``This is the Friday of our mourning and national liberty,'' a
priest at the Patriarhie Orthodox Cathedral told worshipers packing
the 300-year-old church in downtown Bucharest. ``Friday will be
from now on a sacred and blessed day for the Romanian people.''
   Iliescu, Premier Petre Roman and other leaders of the
provisional government attended the solemn service, which was
broadcast live on state radio and television. It was conducted by
Patriarch Teoctist, the spiritual leader of the Romanian Orthodox
Church.
   Later in the day, 5,000 demonstrators, mostly young people,
gathered outside the headquarters of the interim government and
shouted slogans such as ``Down With Communism!'' and ``Kill the
Communists!''
   The protesters booed Iliescu, a former Communist, and other
government leaders who tried to address the crowd and burned a
Communist flag and party identification papers at the emotional
demonstration, witnesses said.
   Government critics have said too many people who belonged to the
Communist Party are now serving in the new government.
   The daily Romania Libera carried an appeal from members of the
dissolved Romanian Communist Party calling on members to burn their
party cards ``at places where martyrs of the revolution died as a
public condemnation of any idea of recreating a new Communist
Party.''
   After Ceausescu's ouster, officials said the Romanian Communist
Party, which was totally discredited by the former leader's harsh
rule, had automatically ceased to exist.
   The news agency Rompres quoted Silviu Brucan, a senior member of
the ruling National Salvation Front, as saying that 10,000 people
died in the revolt.
   Dumas conveyed a message from President Francois Mitterrand
pledging support for the ``consolidation of the conquests of the
popular revolution and for political stability,'' the official
Rompres news agency said.
   Dumas later told a news conference that projects under
discussion included a development bank and health-related programs,
but he declined to elaborate.
   Iliescu thanked France for its offer of aid.
   France and Romania have historically strong ties. Before World
War II, many Romanians went to France to study, and French was the
main foreign language spoken in the country.
   Official Bucharest Radio said some people ``stole and sold for
profit goods received as aid from abroad'' following the uprising
and said the National Salvation Front decreed prison terms of three
to 10 years for the offenders.
   The broadcast did not say how many speculators were caught, but
newspapers have been increasingly critical of ``dubious people''
handling distribution of medicine, food and clothing from some
centers in Bucharest.
   ``Some of them, pretending to help in unpacking the foreign
goods, just waited for the right moment when they could steal
something,'' the daily Adevarul said.
   The decree, signed by Iliescu, also provides for confiscation of
private property of the thieves. Attempts to steal or sell such
goods for profit are also punishable.
   Rompres said the Front also reduced the punishment for illegally
crossing the border. Under new regulations, illegally entering or
leaving Romania is punishable by a 15- to 30-day jail sentence or a
fine. Formerly, people caught trying to cross the border illegally
drew lengthy prison terms or were beaten.
   Ceausescu was toppled on Dec. 22. He and his politically
powerful wife, Elena, were executed on Dec. 25 after a secret trial
in which they were convicted of crimes against the state.

   A Marine fighter jet crashed this
morning on a landing approach to Willow Grove Naval Air Station,
injuring the pilot and damaging at least one business and some
nearby homes, the Navy said.
   The pilot of the one-seat jet ejected before the craft hit the
ground and burst into flames, authorities said.
   He was taken to Abington Memorial Hospital, where Linda Miller,
a spokeswoman, said he was in stable condition and alert. She said
the Navy requested that no additional information be given.
   The A-4 Skyhawk attack jet was on a routine training mission
when it crashed just off the base about 10:45 a.m., Navy spokesman
Rich Beth said.
   The crash site was near an intersection in a residential area of
Upper Moreland Township, a Philadelphia suburb in Montgomery County
located north of the city, police said.
   ``We heard a very loud plane, it shook the building,'' said
Leanne Carbohn, who manages a nearby service station. ``Then we
heard this loud bang and all the electricity went out.''
   ``We came outside and there was all this black smoke. We didn't
know if they dropped a bomb or what. It took several fronts of
houses off,'' she said.
   Police and military personnel said they had no word of anyone
injured on the ground. Smoke hampered search efforts by
firefighters and Navy personnel, and there was no immediate
assessment of damage.
   The crash occurred near the Pennsylvania Turnpike, but state
police said the road was not damaged and traffic was not affected.
   The jet belonged to Marine Air Group 49, based at the Willow
Grove station. Beth said the military is withholding all
information about the pilot until relatives are notified of his
condition.

<HEAD>Dutch Drug Policy Deserves Close Study, Embassy Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Holland's approach to drugs, which treats an
abuser not as a criminal but as ``an unfortunate with health and
social problems,'' could teach something to the United States, say
American diplomats in The Hague.
   Dutch policy ``is often mistranslated and misinterpreted as
`indulgent' or `permissive.' In fact, in this society, it operates
as a powerful social control,'' according to a report from the U.S.
Embassy.
   Drugs are illegal in the Netherlands, but possession of an ounce
or less of any drug, including hard drugs such as cocaine, heroin,
LSD and amphetamine, generally is not prosecuted. And marijuana
cases are seldom prosecuted unless very large quantities are
involved, the report said.
   Marijuana and hashish are sold openly at an estimated 650 night
clubs and coffee shops throughout the Netherlands. The sales are
tolerated if the buyer is at least 18 years old and there are no
hard-drug sales, publicity or advertising. And the amounts sold
must be no larger than 30 grams.
   ``In light of our own problems, a ... goal for U.S.
policy-makers might be an educational'' approach, said the report,
dated May 26 and made available this week to The Associated Press.
   Eddy Engelsman, the Dutch director of drug policy, said he found
the embassy report's views ``rather surprising, because we do know
that the official opinion of the United States is not very
positive.''
   Decriminalization of some drugs has been a growing issue in the
United States as the drug market thrives and spawns violence.
Former Secretary of State George Shultz and U.S. District Judge
Robert W. Sweet of New York are among prominent officials who have
said the idea should be seriously studied.
   But William J. Bennett, the U.S. drug policy coordinator,
adamantly opposes any move toward decriminalization, calling it
``stupid and morally atrocious.'' He says providing clean needles
to addicts _ the practice in Holland _ ``muddies the message'' even
though medical experts have said the sharing of dirty needles has
contributed greatly to the spread of AIDS.
   Italy recently reversed its 15-year experiment with drug
legalization, noted Bennett spokesman Don Hamilton, saying former
Prime Minister Bettino Craxi told Bennett the experience was ``a
disaster.''
   ``The European experience as a whole, as opposed to the
reportedly good results in Holland, don't give us reason to think
legalization or decriminalization of possession is likely to
produce any good results in the United States,'' Hamilton said.
   And Catherine Shaw, spokeswoman for the State Department's
Office of International Narcotics Matters, said Thursday that the
department has not officially endorsed the report.
   ``There's no shift in policy from what I can tell that would
look more favorably on a lenient drug policy,'' she said. ``I can't
say that study reflects a U.S. government position.''
   Shaw said she was unsure who wrote the report. The copy obtained
by The Associated Press was unsigned.
   The report said, ``Dutch policy focuses on the drug abuser. It
views him primarily as an unfortunate with health and social
problems rather than primarily as a criminal. It attempts to keep
him `above ground' and it wants him within reach of medical
authority. The policy attempts to stabilize his life and to limit
the damage he causes to society, to family and to himself. It
encourages and provides immediate therapy....''
   ``It is unlikely that many elements of Dutch drug policy
successfully could be wrenched out of their social and cultural
contexts,'' the report said. ``However, certain of the mechanics
such as low-threshhold therapy, mobile treatment units, and needle
exchange might well be adaptable to the American reality.''
   Dutch policy has resulted in low levels of drug abuse and
virtually no crack market.
   A study done in December 1988 showed that in the 10-to-18 age
bracket, only 1.8 percent said they had used cannabis in the
previous month, said Engelsman, who heads the Dutch Ministry of
Health's Alcohol, Drugs and Tobacco branch.
   By contrast, a recent survey of almost 400,000 U.S. students in
grades six through 12 by the National Parents' Resource Institute
for Drug Education Inc. found 9.1 percent of students said they had
smoked marijuana at least once in the previous month.
   ``We just don't push people underground,'' Engelsman said in a
telephone interview Thursday. ``We think the drug problem is a
normal problem, like a lot of other social and health problems.
That's why I'm also responsible for alcohol and tobacco policy.''
   The embassy report said the Dutch contrast their own drug
situation with the growing drug-related violence wracking some
areas of the United States and conclude ``that their national
policy to confront it was on a true course.''
   The Netherlands has only 60 to 80 drug abuse-related deaths per
year in a population of nearly 15 million, the report says, an
average of about one per 214,000 people.
   There were some 6,756 drug abuse-related deaths reported in 1988
to the U.S. Drug Abuse Warning Network by medical examiners in 27
areas of the nation. That sample works out to about one drug death
per 37,000 people.
   Holland also has about 800 AIDS cases, about 65 of them drug
abusers, giving the Netherlands about one AIDS case per 18,750
people. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control says
that as of Nov. 30, AIDS had been diagnosed in 115,158 Americans,
or about one AIDS case per 2,167 people.

   Several hundred Azerbaijani protesters blockaded
government offices and briefly seized the local radio station in
the Caspian Sea port city of Lenkoran, the official news agency
Azerinform said today.
   The protesters were expressing their outrage over an Armenian
parliamentary measure that implied possession of the disputed
territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, said Savili Peretz, deputy director
of Azerinform. He said the protest took place on Thursday but that
the Lenkoran area ``remained tense'' today.
   The official news agency Tass said today that a lieutenant of
the Interior Ministry, which is trying to keep order in
Nagorno-Karabakh, was killed. Lt. I. Tsymbalyuk was shot Thursday
in the village of Akhullu. Tass said a preliminary investigation
determined an Azerbaijani policemen fired the shot.
   Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave in Azerbaijan that is claimed by
both Armenia and Azerbaijan, has been in a state of virtual civil
war for two years.
   The dispute, the most intractable of the Kremlin's ethnic
conflicts, has left more than 200 people dead.
   The Lenkoran protesters objected to a measure approved by the
Armenian Parliament on Tuesday incorporating an economic and social
development plan for Nagorno-Karabakh into that of the Armenian
republic, Peretz said.
   A crowd of several hundred people blockaded the Communist Party
and government headquarters and took over the radio station to
broadcast their opinions about the Armenian move, he said. No one
was injured, and the protest ended peacefully after a few hours
with no arrests, Peretz said.
   Unrest in Azerbaijan also occurred earlier this month on the
border with Iran. Azerbaijanis who wanted to be united with their
ethnic brethren across the frontier rampaged for several days
around New Year's, tearing down border fences and putting guard
towers and communication lines out of commission.
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry says restrictions on border crossing
will be eased, and it is working with Iran to accomplish that and
keep the area calm.
   The Armenian measure that caused the Lenkoran unrest also was
condemned by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other Soviet
leaders on Wednesday.
   They also criticized an Azerbaijani bill that put forth a claim
to Nagorno-Karabakh. The officials said both measures were void.
   The latest unrest comes as Gorbachev is touring Lithuania in a
bid to persuade the restive Baltic republic to drop its demands for
independence.
   Azerbaijanis, who are predominantly Shiite Moslem, have been
holding mass rallies to protest the Armenian legislature's action
and have resumed a railroad blockade of Armenia, which mostly
Christian.
   The national legislature in Moscow in November disbanded a
commission that had imposed direct Kremlin rule on
Nagorno-Karabakh's 160,000 people. The resolution said the area is
part of Azerbaijan and will be controlled by local government
bodies under the supervision of a national commission.

   Charles Stuart tried to enlist two of his brothers
in the plot to murder his pregnant wife, and one became at least an
unwitting partner and the other begged off of ``any sort of crazy
thing,'' a lawyer said.
   Attorney Richard Clayman told reporters Thursday that his
client, Michael Stuart, and another brother, Matthew, were the only
family members who knew of Charles' involvement in the crime before
Jan. 1.
   But he also revealed that Michael Stuart had been approached by
Charles weeks before the Oct. 23 slaying but did not realize the
significance of the overture.
   A grand jury met today to hear testimony in the Stuart case.
   Three days after the shooting that his brother claimed had been
at the hands of a mugger, Matthew Stuart told Michael Stuart that
he had disposed of the suspected murder weapon at his brother's
request. Matthew and Michael Stuart did not share their knowledge
with the rest of the family until shortly before Charles Stuart
committed suicide Jan. 4, Clayman said.
   ``The appearance that has evolved in my judgment is that some
type of conspiratorial scenario existed by and between all of these
family members sitting around talking about keeping something
hidden. That is not true,'' said Clayman.
   Accompanying Clayman at a news conference were Michael and Mark
Stuart and two sisters, Shelley Yandoli and Neysa Porter. Matthew
Stuart did not attend.
   The Boston Globe reported today that Charles Stuart had asked a
truck driver for help in killing his wife, but the man refused.
Stuart told the man his wife refused to get an abortion, the paper
said, citing investigative sources.
   Investigators found a third bullet in the car in which the
shootings occurred, the Boston Herald and the Globe reported today.
The bullet reportedly was either in the roof liner or the left
visor.
   The Herald said investigators were trying to determine if the
bullet had been fired by a third person in the back seat, but the
Globe said authorities believe Stuart fired the shot to back up a
story that the robber fired at his head, missed and fired again.
Stuart was shot in the stomach, his wife in the head.
   The Herald also reported being told by an unidentified family
source that Matthew told family members the gun believed used in
the shootings was passed to him by Charles over the body of his
dying wife.
   Matthew, who was in another car, reportedly told police he had
seen something in the passenger seat of his brother's car but did
not know it was Carol.
   Clayman was asked if Charles Stuart ever asked Michael Stuart
for assistance in killing his wife.
   ``There may have been an early, disjointed, vague conversation
by and between Charles Stuart and my client, Michael Stuart, weeks
before Oct. 23, the day of the homicide, which at that time had no
significance to Mike,'' Clayman said.
   Clayman, who declined to elaborate on the contents of the
discussion, said Michael Stuart's response was, ``a definitive `I
don't know exactly what you're talking about, but I'm not getting
involved in any sort of crazy thing you're talking about.'''
   Clayman said Matthew Stuart had told Michael Stuart of the
homicide within three days of the crime. He said his client would
tell a grand jury investigating the incident anything they want to
know.
   ``I am comfortable that there is no violation of law ... that
his hands are legally clean,'' Clayman said.
   Law experts say there is no legal requirement in Massachusetts
for someone to come forward with knowledge of a crime.
   Clayman also said the Stuart family wanted people to know ``they
loved Carol Stuart'' and that their family and her parents had
suffered greatly.
   Stuart told police after the shooting that he and his wife were
attacked by a black mugger as they left a birthing class at a city
hospital. But last week, Matthew Stuart told authorities he met his
brother at the crime scene, without realizing a shooting had
occurred, and retrieved Mrs. Stuart's handbag, which contained
personal items and the gun.
   Meanwhile, divers searched the Pines River again for a gold
watch and a ruby ring _ items Stuart reportedly said were stolen
when he and his wife were shot. A snub-nosed .38-caliber revolver
believed used in the crime was recovered Tuesday.
   In another development, black state legislators met with
Democratic House Speaker George Keverian on Thursday to ask for a
special legislative commission to look into the dragnet police
conducted in black neighborhoods for the suspect.
   Gov. Michael Dukakis said the commission would be a good idea as
long as it did not interfere with the investigation.
   Investigators have yet to disclose a convincing motive for the
crime, dismissing earlier reports involving drug use or an
extramarital affair.
   One theory is that Stuart wanted to leave the fur store where he
worked and open his own restaurant, but felt his wife and a baby
would be a nuisance.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Friday lauded the
collapse of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe, saying they had
been ``tragic utopias which brought an unprecedented regression in
the tormented history of humanity.''
   In a speech to a meeting of the Pontifical Council for Culture,
the pope gave his most extensive comments to date on the changes
sweeping Eastern Europe, although he did not mention any specific
countries.
   ``A great hope has been raised for freedom, responsibility,
solidarity, spirituality,'' the Polish-born pontiff said, referring
to ``this privileged hour we are now living.''
   ``The great ideologies have shown their failure in the face of
the difficult challenge of events. The so-called scientific systems
of social renewal ... have revealed themselves in the eyes of the
world for what they really were: tragic utopias which brought an
unprecedented regression in the tormented history of humanity.''
   John Paul praised the ``heroic resistance of the Christian
communities against inhuman totalaritarianism.''
   ``Today's world rediscovers that, far from being the opium of
the peoples, faith in Christ is the best guarantee and stimulant of
their freedom,'' he said.
   Much still needs to be done, he said.
   ``Walls have crumbled,'' he said. ``Frontiers have opened. But
huge barriers still stand between hopes for justice and their
realization, between opulence and misery.
   ``The society of tomorrow should be different in a world that no
longer tolerates inhuman static structures. From east to west,
north to south, the history in progress puts in question an order
which was based before on force and fear,'' he said.
   ``All of Europe wonders about its future, while the collapse of
totalitarian systems calls for a deep renewal of politics and
provokes a vigorous return to the spiritual aspirations of peoples.
By necessity, Europe seeks to redefine its own idenity beyond
political systems and military alliances.''
   The pope also referred to the changes in Eastern Europe in
separate remarks to a delegation of Austrians and West Germans.
   ``The extraordinary developments of recent months have
demonstrated in an impressive way how great the significance of
faith and religion is for change of political and social
situations.''

<TEXT>
   Catawba County got only one bid for the
rights to its safe-sex poster that urges, ``If You Can't Keep It
Zipped _ Keep It Covered.''
   The bid came from the same Hickory advertising firm that
designed and printed 2,500 copies of the poster.
   The San Francisco AIDS Foundation has enough posters of its own,
while the National Lesbian and Gay Health Foundation likes the
concept, but has no use for it. And the sign is too tame for the
Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York, where condom use is promoted
by such posters as ``A Rubber Is A Friend In Your Pocket.''
   The county health department developed the poster of an unzipped
pair of blue jeans which advertises free condoms at local health
departments.
   In October, ministers, parents and others protested, saying the
poster was vulgar. Catawba commissioners responded by voting to
sell the copyright.
   Health officials, estimating the poster cost $6,000, hoped a
nationally recognized health group would buy it and promote it.
   ``I was disappointed,'' Catawba health educator Tamara
Dempsey-Tanner said.
   Dempsey-Tanner said she contacted 36 AIDS, adolescent pregnancy
and health-related organizations she thought might be interested.
   ``It was a good poster. I think it will be effective,'' the Rev.
Michael Weeks Weeks, administrative director for the National
Lesbian and Gay Health Foundation in Washington, said Thursday.
``If you've created controversy you probably have a winning piece
of educational material.''
   Weeks said his organization sponsors conferences and answers
people's concerns, but doesn't produce and distribute posters.
   In New York, the Gay Men's Health Crisis wants harder-hitting
messages.
   ``We have our own posters promoting condoms and we distribute
them ourselves,'' said spokesman Carisa Cunningham. ``Ours are
pretty explicit, pretty explicitly gay-oriented.''
   Barringer &amp; Associates offered $2,500 for the poster copyright.
County commissioners are expected to approve the sale Tuesday night.
   Barringer's bid is $1,500 less than the county paid the
advertising firm to produce the poster. Phil Barringer, president
of the firm, said he plans to market the poster to other
organizationsm.
   His wife, Barbara Barringer, a nurse at Valdese General
Hospital, helped develop the poster and won a North Carolina Nurses
Association research award for her work.

   Martin Luther King Jr. ``would be marching
hand-in-hand in the war against drugs'' if he were living,
Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan said today at an observance
of the slain civil rights leader's birthday.
   ``There are no opportunities for people addicted to drugs. There
is no dream,'' Lujan told an overflow crowd in the 850-seat
auditorium of the Interior Department.
   ``There is only the nightmare of the fatal consequences of drug
use,'' he said. ``Martin Luther King would not stand for drug use
and neither should we.''
   ``Part of our commitment to educating young Americans must
include programs to discourage them from the deadly scourge of
drugs,'' Lujan told the audience.
   ``If Dr. King were alive today, he would be marching
hand-in-hand in the war against drugs, fighting to stop the next
generation from destroying itself,'' he said.
   C.T. Vivian, a former member of King's staff who now heads the
Black Action Strategies and Information Center, told the crowd in
which black people were in a slight preponderance, ``We would not
be meeting in this room right now if it were not for Martin King.''
   ``We knew the central prophet of our time,'' said Vivian. ``He
created the atmosphere in which we grew.''
   Later, a slightly smaller crowd gathered for a wreath-laying
ceremony outside the Lincoln Memorial, where King delivered his
celebrated ``I have a dream'' speech in the climax of a civil
rights march in 1963.
   James M. Ridenour, director of the National Park Service, told
the group, ``The sound of Dr. King's words still rings in our ears.
As we stand here again in the place where he stood, we can feel his
presence.''
   King, leader of the black civil rights movement in America, was
shot to death April 4, 1968, in Memphis. James Earl Ray is serving
a life sentence for the slaying. King's birthday is being observed
Monday as a federal holiday. He was born Jan. 15, 1929.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze will hold talks in
Moscow Feb. 6-7 to make preparations for a June superpower summit
in Washington, the two governments announced Friday.
   Baker's agenda includes arms control issues, human rights and
regional conflicts, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said.
   In Moscow, Vadim P. Perfiliev, a spokesman for the Soviet
foreign ministry, said discussion of a new treaty to reduce
strategic nuclear weapons was expected to dominate the
Baker-Shevardnadze talks.
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
isolated three treaty problems for the Moscow talks.
   The most complex concerns how long-range, air-launched cruise
missiles carried by bombers should be counted against a treaty
limit of 6,000 strategic warheads.
   The two other issues are the kind of data from missile tests
that could be encrypted, or disguised, and where surplus, or
non-deployed, missiles would be stored.
   Even settling these three problems would not wrap up the new
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), which Bush and Gorbachev
would like to sign at their June summit in Washington.
   For instance, the two sides are in sharp disagreement over
sea-launched cruise missiles.
   Perfiliev said ``questions of a military-political nature will
be especially deeply discussed, and first of all those connected
with the completion this year of work on a treaty on a 50-percent
cut in strategic offensive weapons.''
   Boucher, responding to questions, said Baker was also likely to
discuss with Shevardnadze developments in Lithuania and Latvia. He
reitered U.S. policy is to support ``self-determination.''
   Asked if this meant the Bush administration supports
independence for the Baltic republics, the spokesman said, ``I
would not want to draw a distinction.''
   Gorbachev is on a three-day visit to Lithuania appealing to the
3.5 million people there to remain in the Soviet Union. He said
Thursday his program for economic rehabilitation of the country
depends on what happens in Lithuania.

   An American pilot for the Colombian
Medellin cocaine cartel was sentenced Friday to two consecutive
life terms and fined $2 million.
   Jack Carlton Reed, 59, already is serving a 15-year prison term
for another drug-conspiracy conviction in a trial with Carlos
Lehder Rivas, a co-founder of the Medellin cocaine cartel.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Moore II ordered one of the life
terms to run at the same time as Reed's current sentence, but each
of the life terms will be consecutive.
   Co-defendant Donald Lady, 41, of Pomona, Calif., was sentenced
to 10 years in federal prison on one count of conspiracy to import
cocaine. He allegedly secured a farm in Mexico for cocaine flights.
   Reed, who was arrested in 1987 in Panama, was convicted in
October of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and operating a
continuing criminal enterprise.
   Prosecutors say Reed was a key player in Lehder's organization.
He worked as a pilot flying large cocaine shipments from Colombia,
hired ground crews and worked with distributors.
   The ``Son of Lehder'' case grew out of testimony in the 1987-88
trial of Lehder, 40, who was convicted and is serving a life term
plus 135 years.
   People alleged to be leaders of the Medellin cartel, including
Pablo Escobar Gaviria and Fabio and Jorge Ochoa, plus U.S. fugitive
Robert Vesco, also are under indictment in the case but remain at
large.
   Nine defendants have pleaded guilty.
   Jorge Mario de la Cuesta, who also is named in the indictment,
has been extradited to Jacksonville from Colombia to stand trial.
De la Cuesta, identified by the government as the private pilot for
Lehder and then Escobar, is to go on trial Feb. 5.

   Jurors who acquitted a woman in a stabbing
case have taken the unusual step of telling the mayor, police chief
and others that the woman should never have been charged and that a
policeman should be suspended.
   ``We believe it was because of cursory, indifferent and racially
biased police work that Betty Burns, one of our Native American
citizens, was maltreated, even incarcerated unjustifiably, for over
four months,'' the jurors said in a letter to Mayor Don Fraser,
Police Chief John Laux and others.
   The letter, signed by all 12 jurors and an alternate, accused
Sgt. Robert Nelson of badgering Burns ``with various forms of
mental cruelty _ lies, blame, guilt, threats of physical violence,
assertions of white dominance and the threat of a lengthy jail term
_ until he got her to confess to something she never did.''
   Nelson, a 20-year veteran of the department, said Thursday that
the allegations are unfounded.
   ``Part of what grabbed me was this could happen to any one of us
at any time and how are we going to get out of this fix that Betty
Burns was in?'' juror Carla Rohwedder said Thursday.
   The jurors acquitted Burns last November and their letter was
sent this week. Rohwedder said Friday it took time for all 13 jury
members to reach a consensus, phoning each other and rewriting the
letter.
   Laux said Thursday that he has turned over the jury's
accusations to the police internal affairs division.
   Deputy Chief Dave Dobrotka, who will conduct the investigation,
said some of the allegations, specifically that Nelson coerced
Burns into confessing to the assault, involve possible criminal
violations. The investigation also will look into whether Burns'
civil rights were violated, he said.
   Laux would not comment on the allegations, except to say that
Nelson ``has an outstanding record in this department.''
   Fraser said he is taking the jury's letter ``very, very
seriously.''
   ``I think the way the letter is written and the amount of detail
that's provided all demand a thorough investigation and that's what
will happen,'' he said.
   Burns, 31, who turned down a plea bargain at the start of her
trial, said she is ``grateful and surprised'' by the jury's action.
   Judge Roland Amundson, who presided over the trial, said, ``Many
of us see things that are unjust, but we rarely act upon them
because we have so many other things to care about or concern
ourselves about.''
   Burns was accused of stabbing her boyfriend, Sheldon Geshick, in
an alley on June 23.
   Geshick had a deep gash that went into his brain and several
other wounds and suffered ``expressive aphasia,'' which made him
unable to say what he wanted to say.
   Nelson said he eventually was able to make out Geshick saying
``Betty stabbed me.'' He later got a confession from Burns, in
which she admitted stabbing Geshick five or six times.
   The jurors' letter said Nelson used ``bullying and coercive
tactics'' to extract the confession from Burns, a ``mild-natured,
quiet and timid person.''
   In an interview Thursday, Burns said she started to tell Nelson
what she had told police earlier _ that she had gone home ahead of
Geshick. But Nelson ``slammed his fist'' and hollered at her to
tell the truth.
   ``I was afraid. I thought he was going to hurt me,'' she said.
   Nelson defended his interrogation. ``A confession obtained that
way wouldn't be worth the paper it was written on. Slamming your
fist on the table just don't work.''

   More than 200 scientists are eager
to examine the bus-sized, experiment-laden space lab retrieved
Friday by Columbia's astronauts.
   The information they'll get should tell much about how various
materials and systems withstood nearly six years of being pounded
by micrometeoroids, blasted by cosmic rays and corroded by atomic
oxygen.
   Knowing this, scientists and engineers will be better able to
design America's space station Freedom and other long-term
spacecraft such as those planned for the ``Star Wars'' missile
defense system.
   The Long Duration Exposure Facility, or LDEF, has 57 experiments
aboard, including one to collect interplanetary dust, and more than
12 million tomato seeds that will be subjected to student testing.
   After an initial survey of the recovered satellite, the
astronauts reported some corrosion damage to a few of the
experiments and said the foil covering a heavy ion collector had
been torn away.
   But shuttle flight director Al Pennington said an initial
television look at LDEF indicates minimal damage.
   ``It's a good-looking spacecraft,'' he said. ``The scientists
I've talked with are very, very pleased. It looks like we have a
very valuable piece of science in our grasp.''
   Mission specialist Bonnie Dunbar snared the lab with Columbia's
50-foot robot arm, then held it above the shuttle's cargo bay for
an exhaustive photo survey of each of the experiments.
   ``Some might have become so eroded or weakened by the long
exposure to space and bombardment by micrometeoroids and atomic
oxygen that they could fall apart during the stress of atmospheric
re-entry or a return to Earth's gravity,'' Dunbar explained. ``So
we want good documentary photos in case that happens.''
   Had the astronauts failed to rescue LDEF, the slowly falling
satellite would have re-entered Earth's atmosphere about March 9
and burned up.
   When the shuttle lands Jan. 19, the satellite will be taken to a
building at the Kennedy Space Center here for analysis by four
teams _ experts in materials, spacecraft systems, radiation and
space debris. Then the experiments will be distributed to their
designers.
   Most scientists will reap a big bonus because the satellite has
been in space five years longer than intended. It was to have been
retrieved 10 months after another shuttle crew put it in orbit in
April 1984. But scheduling problems and the 1986 Challenger
explosion delayed the pickup until now.
   ``LDEF is invaluable to us,'' said Pennington. ``It is chock
full of every material we use in space flight. Metals, graphite
epoxies, antenna designs, polymers, resins, thermal coatings, major
optics have been sitting up there in orbit for six years being
bombarded by atomic oxygen, radiation, micrometeoroids and other
things that come in from outer space.''
   The satellite carries 21 materials, coating and thermal systems
experiments; five power and propulsion experiments, 17 science
experiments and 14 electronics and optics experiments.
   The experiments represent more than 200 investigators, 33
private companies, 21 universities, 7 NASA centers and 8 foreign
countries.
   One experiment was designed to capture tiny particles of
interplanetary dust which give scientists insight about the origin
of the sun and planets.
   Also aboard are 12.5 million tomato seeds which will be
distributed to American students in grades 5 through university
level.
   Kits of 50 LDEF seeds and 50 control seeds, those kept sealed on
the ground throughout the flight, will be made available to
teachers and students for research into such things as germination
rates, chromosome and population genetics studies and full tomato
growth.
   ``Because this is the first opportunity for long-duration space
exposure of living tissues, every classroom experiment will be
significant,'' said NASA administrator Richard H. Truly.

<HEAD>No Agreements Between Hong Kong, China After 3 Days of Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governor of Hong Kong said Friday he and
Chinese officials explained their positions on the colony's
political future, but neither side reported concrete agreements in
three days of talks.
   ``There is still discussion to take place on how the political
model evolves,'' Sir David Wilson said at the airport before flying
home. ``We have made considerable progress in trying to explain
sensibly and clearly what the problems are on both sides and trying
to reach understanding about them. I think it's been a useful visit
in that context.''
   China's official Xinhua News Agency quoted Premier Li Peng as
telling Wilson that he was ``glad to see that on some issues the
two sides are drawing closer,'' but did not elaborate.
   It was Wilson's first visit to Beijing since China violently
crushed pro-democracy protests in June, badly shaking the
confidence of Hong Kong residents about their future after Britain
hands the colony back to China in 1997.
   Hong Kong activists have pressed for more guarantees from China
about their future and a speedier evolution of democratic processes
in their local government before 1997. China has opposed both
demands and moved to put clauses outlawing ``subversion'' in Hong
Kong's post-1997 basic law.
   Both sides commented only generally on the content of Wilson's
meetings, but described them as ``frank,'' which in diplomatic
parlance generally means they disagreed.
   At times they seemed unable to agree even about the weather,
used repeatedly as an analogy for the political climate.
   On arrival in Hong Kong, Wilson described the trip as
``road-building'' and the main achievement was ``to be able to
re-establish a dialogue, talk about problems in a straightforward
way.''
   Emerging from a 90-minute meeting with Wilson on Friday, Li
entertained Hong Kong reporters with a sometimes confusing weather
report.
   ``The weather is a bit chilly but I hope the atmosphere is still
warm,'' he said. ``It's cold outside but the sky is blue and it
feels very comfortable.''
   When Wilson said he had come because ``recently the political
climate has been getting difficult,'' Li answered bluntly: ``Maybe
that's your feeling but I feel fine.''
   On Thursday, Li Hou, deputy director of China's Hong Kong and
Macao Affairs Office, told Wilson that some Hong Kong residents
were trying to ``bring wind and rain'' into the relationship. He
noted a recent Hong Kong demonstration calling for the overthrow of
the ``Ceausescus of China,'' a reference to ousted Romanian
Communist Party leader Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Wilson said distinctions should be made between ``small showers
and typhoons,'' but Li responded: ``If small showers are not looked
after, they can turn into typhoons.''
   At the airport, Wilson said he briefed Chinese officials about
the spectrum of opinions in Hong Kong on how much democracy should
be introduced into local government before and after 1997.
   He said he explained the colony's plan to insert a bill of
rights into its legal code, and its position on allowing Hong Kong
residents to speak out about mainland politics. China has denounced
Hong Kong criticism of its human rights record as subversion.
   ``We in Hong Kong have no intention that Hong Kong should be
used as a base for subversion,'' Wilson said. ``Particularly we
don't want people from outside Hong Kong to come to Hong Kong and
try to use it as a battlefield against China.
   ``At the same time we treasure our own liberties and freedoms
under the law in Hong Kong and I was explaining that we apply the
law equally, that no one has more rights or less under the law,''
he said.
   Guo Fengmin, to be appointed shortly as ambassador to the
Chinese-British Joint Liaison Group on Hong Kong, refused to
respond to a question about whether China would guarantee Hong Kong
residents' right to political dissent.
   Li, asked after his meeting with Wilson how it went, said:
``Your governor can take the message to the Hong Kong people.'' But
Wilson said Li gave him no special message, only expressed concern
that the Hong Kong and Chinese economies should help each other
develop.
   Wilson said in Hong Kong that Li was ``very interested in the
whole concept of the interrelationship of economy between Hong Kong
and China.''

   A federal magistrate set $1 million bond for a
co-defendant of deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega today
and attorneys huddled for discussions about Noriega's detention in
the courthouse basement.
   U.S. Magistrate Peter Palermo set the $1 million bail for Daniel
Miranda, who is charged with flying from Fort Lauderdale to Panama
with $800,000 in laundered drug money. But prosecutors appealed the
bail, meaning that Miranda, 36, could not immediately be released.
   Miranda's attorney, Michael O'Kane was late to court because he
was attacked near his home by a masked man with a foot-long
crowbar. Police arrested a suspect, but would give no details.
   ``I can't think of anybody who would do this,'' O'Kane said.
``Maybe it has to do with the case, maybe not.''
   O'Kane said his attacker offered to tell who sent him only if
assault charges were dropped, but the attorney said he did not plan
to drop the charges.
   O'Kane's head was bandaged but still bleeding when he arrived in
court. His report of the attack prompted federal marshals to
increase security for Palmermo.
   Attorneys met privately with U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler for what The Miami Herald reported would be discussions of
efforts to move Noriega to more secure quarters until his trial on
drug trafficking charges.
   Participants said they were under strict orders not to discuss
any transfer plans publicly. Speculation has centered on federal
prisons in Atlanta and Marion, Ill. as possible destinations.
   A Justice Department security team sent from Washington to
protect classified information in the Noriega trial has told
defense attorneys they may have to pass security clearances before
gaining access to the documents they need.
   The Justice Department is not only deciding which documents are
accessible, but through the U.S. attorney's office is playing the
role of prosecutor of Noriega, who assisted the CIA from the 1970s
until 1985.
   ``It is pretty odd that they're both from the Department of
Justice and yet these people (court security) claim that they're
neutral,'' said Steven Kreisberg, who represents Noriega
co-defendant William Saldarriaga of Colombia, an alleged cocaine
trafficker. ``When they all work in the same department, I question
that.''
   As a sign of the extra security surrounding the case, documents
are being sealed on arrival at federal court for transfer to
Hoeveler.
   O'Kane charged U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen was misapplying
security guidelines and contended he was threatened by government
officials in the name of security.
   O'Kane, as part of a defense motion this week, asked the
government to examine intelligence information collected at a U.S.
military telecommunications listening post dubbed ``The Tunnel'' in
Panama City.
   He attached a map copied from the Panama City telephone book to
specify its location, and was contacted by a member of the security
team and then by a prosecutor in Lehtinen's office ``who tells me
they are very upset in Washington with what I've been filing and if
I don't get on board it will be bad for my client and bad for me
personally.''
   Reacting to O'Kane's comments, Lehtinen spokeswoman Diane Cossin
said, ``Defense counsel should abide by ethical standards and not
try this case in the news media or comment on any discussions with
the U.S. attorney's office.''
   O'Kane met on security issues Thursday with Hoeveler and Justice
officials, and the judge laughed when O'Kane explained the source
of the map.
   Another security provision ``is that no classified information
be discussed even over the telephone because of the danger of
interception of these transmissions, by the Russians or whoever,''
said Kreisberg.
   Meanwhile, the arrival of Noriega in Miami on Jan. 4 to face the
drug indictment has fueled speculation that co-defendants may
pursue plea bargains to avoid sitting through a bombardment of
allegations aimed largely at Noriega.
   The indictment issued in February 1988 accuses Noriega of
protecting cocaine shipments heading north and coca processing
chemicals and drug money headed south.
   Samuel Burstyn, who represents former Noriega intelligence chief
Luis del Cid, said, ``The thought of going to trial in a joint
trial with Mr. Noriega with the prospects of that being a real
dog-and-pony show are not very appealing to us, so to a certain
extent we are motivated to forgo a lengthy and difficult trial.''
   Both Burstyn and Kreisberg are seeking separate trials for their
clients.

   The voice of Martin Luther King rang out once
more at the Lincoln Memorial on Friday as government officials and
school children joined in a birthday observance highlighted by a
recording of the slain civil rights leader's ``I have a dream''
speech.
   ``As we stand here again in the place where he stood, we can
feel his presence,'' James M. Ridenour, director of the National
Park Service, told a crowd of several hundred assembled in chilly,
windy weather at the memorial.
   Effi Barry, wife of District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry,
blinked back tears as the recording came to the climax of King's
speech, ending with the words, ``free at last, free at last, thank
God almighty, we are free at last.''
   Later, Ms. Barry joined Ridenour and two children representing
District of Columbia schools in laying three floral wreaths at the
memorial in honor of King.
   King was shot to death April 4, 1968, in Memphis. Had he lived,
he would be 61 on Monday. His speech at the memorial was the climax
of a civil rights march in 1963.
   As King's voice spoke of his dream that ``little black boys and
black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and
little white girls as sisters and brothers,'' a massed choir from
the district's public elementary schools stood on the memorial
steps. All but a few of the youngsters were black.
   Earlier, Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan Jr. told an
overflow crowd in the 850-seat Interior Department auditorium, ``If
Dr. King were alive today, he would be marching hand-in-hand in the
war against drugs, fighting to stop the next generation from
destroying itself.''
   ``There are no opportunities for people addicted to drugs. There
is no dream,'' Lujan said. ``There is only the nightmare of the
fatal consequences of drug use. Martin Luther King would not stand
for drug use and neither should we.''
   C.T. Vivian, a former member of King's staff who now heads the
Black Action Strategies and Information Center, told the crowd,
``We would not be meeting in this room right now if it were not for
Martin King.''
   ``We knew the central prophet of our time,'' said Vivian. ``He
created the atmosphere in which we grew.''

<TEXT>
   As a group of patients watched,
authorities arrested a doctor for investigation of treating AIDS
victims with injections of what officials believe was lemon extract.
   Stephen D. Herman, 53, was charged Thursday with four violations
of the California Health and Safety Code, which prohibits the sale
or advertisement of unproven AIDS drugs.
   Authorities said they believed Herman was the first physician
arrested in California for investigation of dispensing unproven
remedies for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. There is no known
cure for the deadly disease.
   The treatments have been linked to the death of one man and
serious complications in two others, said Orange and Los Angeles
county health department officials.
   Herman was not charged in connection with the death or
complications, said investigators with the Medical Board of
California.
   Herman was arrested Thursday as he lectured a dozen prospective
patients at his home in Villa Park, about 30 miles southeast of Los
Angeles. He was booked into Orange County Jail.
   Herman claimed the AIDS virus could be stopped by a drug he
called ``viroxan'' that he manufactured in his kitchen, said
Kathleen L. Schmidt, a senior medical board investigator.
   An undercover officer at his lecture left and returned with
several police officers, a witness said.
   Don Hagan, a physician and AIDS activist attending the session,
said several people were terrified they might be arrested and their
conditions publicized.
   Dr. David Dassey, an epidemiologist with the Los Angeles County
Department of Health Services, said he learned of Herman's
treatments when a San Francisco area physician called him inquiring
about a friend's death.
   The man was infected with the AIDS virus but had not suffered
any illnesses associated with the disease and had been in good
health until two weeks before his death, said Dassey.
   He died of septicimia, a toxic disease caused by injection of
microscopic organisms into the bloodstream, he said.
   County health officials analyzed the treatment and found it was
``some kind of lemon extract,'' said Dr. Thomas Prendergast, an
Orange County Health Department epidemiologist.

   A cable television company has dropped the
MTV music video channel from its service because of complaints
about offensive videos, the company manager said.
   ``I don't know if it was an organized effort or people just
decided to call at the same time, but we got a large number of
requests all of a sudden from these areas to remove the service,''
said Doug Bierschbach, manager of Satellite Cable TV Systems.
   Last month, the company stopped offering MTV in Parkston or
Freeman, towns of about 1,300 each.
   ``In the 10 years we've been in operation, we've never had
anything like this cause so many complaints,'' Bierschbach said.
   MTV was replaced by the Discovery Channel. Bierschbach said his
office has since received about a dozen complaints from young
viewers.
   Missy Stork, a Parkston High School senior, said she wrote the
company protesting the change.
   Subscribers ``have the authority to shut it off if they don't
like it,'' she said Wednesday. ``They could have controlled it in
their own houses instead of shutting it off for everybody.''

<HEAD>Aspin Criticizes Use of Stealth Plane in Panama Invasion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee said Friday that the Defense Department's use of the
high-tech, stealth F-117A fighter-bomber in the U.S. invasion of
Panama was ``show biz.''
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., in releasing a report on the Dec. 20
incursion to oust Panamanian dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega, had
nothing but praise for the overall military operation, saying the
armed forces clearly deserved an ``A'' for the effort.
   But the Wisconsin Democrat was highly critical of the Pentagon's
decision to deploy the F-117A stealth fighter to drop two
2,000-pound bombs near infantry barracks at Rio Hato to ``stun,
disorient and confuse'' troops loyal to Noriega.
   Use of the aircraft with its radar-evading capabilities against
a nation that lacks the sophisticated detection technology has been
viewed by some as merely a Pentagon ploy to win support for the
aircraft in Congress.
   The fighter, geared more for use against the Soviet Union in a
nuclear war than against countries fighting a conventional battle,
faces an uphill battle for support on Capitol Hill in light of the
lessening Soviet threat and diminishing military budgets.
   Published reports indicate that the top secret plane costs
somewhat under $50 million apiece.
   ``The military justification was that it was an extremely
accurate weapon,'' Aspin told reporters. ``It looks to me like it's
show biz. We were trying to miss the building. We have lots of
plane that miss them. I think that the issue here was that there
could have been other planes chosen.''
   Shortly after Aspin's comments, Sen. John Warner of Virginia,
the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee,
defended the Pentagon's decision to use the F-117A in the invasion.
   ``We are told this piece of equipment is the best,'' Warner told
a news conference. ``Perhaps another piece could have done a fair
job but we did not want to take the risk of collateral damage.
   ``The military made the right decision,'' Warner said.
   Aspin, in his report on Panama to House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash., and comments to reporters, also said:
   _The United States was lucky in the invasion because the
Panamanian Defense Forces took few hostages and there was a ``lack
of fighting spirit in Mr. Noriega.'' Aspin revealed that at the
start of the invasion Panamanian forces took control of 347
passengers aboard a Brazilian jetliner that had arrived at Torrijos
International Airport. The Panamanians, however, were talked out of
holding the passengers as hostages.
   _Noriega had enough information ahead of time on the U.S.
invasion but evidence indicates the Panamanian leader did not act
upon it. Aspin believes indications of a U.S. invasion had become
so routine that Noriega discounted the latest incident. The
Panamanian dictator eluded U.S. forces for several days before
seeking asylum in the Vatican Embassy on Christmas Eve. He turned
himself in to U.S. authorities last week and is being held in Miami
on drug-trafficking charges.
   _The Bush administration neglected the political aspects of the
operation. Aspin cited the swearing in of the Endara government on
a military base and the Panamanian letter to the Organization of
American States advising of a new ambassador using paper carrying
the U.S. Southern Command label. ``Clearly there was a lack of
sensitivity with the need to build the Endara government, build
democracy,'' Aspin said.
   Warner suggested that members of Congress reserve comment until
after the secretaries of state and defense publicly discuss the
joint effort on the operation. ``Until they've been given an
opportunity to explain the steps they took to coordinate, I think
it's in fairness not wise to criticize,'' Warner said.

<HEAD>Former Boeing Executive Sentenced For Passing Secret Budget
Documents</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Boeing Co. marketing executive
was sentenced on Friday to two years in prison for passing
classified Pentagon budget documents to the aerospace giant and
other defense firms.
   Richard Lee Fowler, 64, a onetime civilian Air Force budget
analyst who worked for Boeing from 1978 to 1986, contended he
didn't know he was breaking the law when he obtained more than 100
classified documents.
   Among the items Fowler passed to Boeing was a five-year Pentagon
budget projection and a National Security Council study of the
Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly known as ``Star Wars.''
   ``I am here today for doing a job I was hired to do by one of
the Fortune 500 companies,'' Fowler told U.S. District Judge Albert
V. Bryan Jr.
   ``They were not aware it was criminal. I was not aware it was
criminal,'' said Fowler, who was held in civil contempt and jailed
earlier in the week for refusing to identify his accomplices during
grand jury testimony.
   Boeing pleaded guilty Nov. 13 to illegally obtaining two secret
Pentagon documents and agreed to pay $5.2 million in fines and
penalties.
   Prosecutors charged the company sought the documents to plan
budgets for future defense contracts.
   Bryan rejected Fowler's argument, saying evidence at the trial
``indicates to me he knew what he was doing with these documents.''
   ``These offenses are serious and they warrant incarceration,''
Bryan said.
   Fowler, convicted last month of 39 felony counts of mail fraud,
conspiracy and unlawful conveyance of government documents, could
have been sentenced up to 310 years in prison and fined $225,000.
   Bryan said Fowler's sentence would not start until he purges
himself of civil contempt for refusing to tell a grand jury who
gave him the documents.
   Fowler, of Springfield, Va., was jailed Wednesday on the
contempt citation after refusing to name his sources of Pentagon
documents.
   Defense attorney John Bray said Fowler could be held for
contempt as long as nine months _ the unexpired portion of the
grand jury's term.
   ``I think it's fair to say he is not likely to change his mind''
about testifying in the grand jury, Bray told reporters outside the
U.S. Courthouse.
   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson said prosecutors could convene a
second grand jury in nine months to try to elicit answers from
Fowler.
   During the sentencing hearing, prosecutor Randy Bellows said
that Fowler deserved imprisonment because he corrupted Pentagon
officials whom he asked to provide secret documents.
   ``For six years Mr. Fowler had people in the Pentagon slipping
and leaking documents to him. These individuals were breaching the
trust of the government,'' Bellows said.
   Bellows cited evidence produced at trial that Fowler ``caused
the dissemination of these documents throughout the industry.''
   Bellows suggested that in spreading the documents around, Fowler
might have given a foreign power the opportunity to intercept
secret information. ``There was a total lack of control of these
documents, who knows where they ended up?'' the prosecutor said.
   Eight other companies were identified during trial testimony as
being part of a network of defense firms that traded Pentagon
budget documents in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
   The other companies were: Honeywell, Bendix, IBM, RCA (which
since merged with General Electric), Grumman, Raytheon, Rockwell
and Martin Marietta.
   Defense attorney Cary Feldman said that Fowler believed all
along that what he was doing was legal.
   ``I don't think there is any question, notwithstanding the
nature of the charges, that Mr. Fowler is loyal to this country,''
the lawyer said.
   Outside the courthouse, Feldman said Fowler would appeal the
conviction.
   The key issue, Feldman said, is: ``Did he know what he was doing
constituted crimes against the United States?''
   ``His position is and our position has always been he did not.''
   Hudson hailed the sentence, saying: `I hope it sends a message
to people in the defense consulting industry that the illegal
procurement of classified documents will not be tolerated.''
   ``Anytime someone illegally obtains classified information and
distributes it, there is a cost to national security,'' Hudson said.

   Roxanne Pulitzer, whose bitter
divorce from publishing heir Herbert Pulitzer became the subject of
a television movie, has won her fight to spend more time with her
twin sons, her attorney said.
   Attorneys on Thursday told a judge they had reached a private
settlement.
   ``We've agreed to keep it private for the children,'' Mrs.
Pulitzer said.
   The settlement gives Mrs. Pulitzer more visitation, said her
attorney Donald Sasser, who did not elaborate.
   Mrs. Pulitzer had asked a judge to modify a 1982 custody order

   Former Cincinnati Bengals running back
Stanley Wilson, expelled from the NFL for life for alleged drug
use, was arrested Friday for investigation of resisting arrest and
possessing drug paraphernalia, authorities said.
   On the night before the Super Bowl a year ago, Wilson, 28, of
Carson was suspended by the Bengals for alleged cocaine use, the
last in a series of suspensions that led to his lifetime ban.
   Authorities here determined Wilson wasn't under the influence of
drugs or alcohol when he was arrested, Deputy George Ducoulombier
said. Deputies patrolling an unincorporated area near Gardena about
1:30 a.m. found Wilson stopped in his car in the middle of an
intersection, Ducoulombier said.
   As deputies approached the car, they spotted a pipe sitting
between the two front seats, said Ducoulombier. The pipe apparently
was used to smoke marijuana, he said.
   Wilson got out of his car and scuffled with deputies, the
sheriff's spokesman said. After a brief struggle, Wilson was
arrested and booked.
   Deputies don't know why Wilson's car was stopped at the
intersection.

   Country singer Tammy Wynette returned to
her adopted hometown in northwestern Alabama for the dedication of
a highway bearing her name.
   Mayor Billy Bolton, friends and family members and Ms. Wynette
watched Thursday as a stretch of Alabama 24 was officially named
the Tammy Wynette Highway.
   ``This is so wonderful,'' said the 47-year-old singer. ``I just
love Red Bay. It's a neat little town.''
   Bolton said the request to rename the highway was in recognition
of Ms. Wynette's contributions to the town, where several of her
relatives live. The 1989 Legislature approved a resolution renaming
the road.
   Ms. Wynette, who lives in Nashville, Tenn., held a concert last
year to benefit Red Bay School. Ms. Wynette said the only other
thing that bears her name is a park in her husband's hometown of
Malden, Mo.

<HEAD>Activists Attack Navy Refusal to Halt Missile Tests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Navy has refused to halt Tomahawk
cruise missile flights over Maine in spite of a statewide
non-binding referendum calling for a ban on the tests.
   Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III said in a letter to
Maine's congressional delegation that three test flights are
planned this year despite last November's election.
   ``Cruise missile test flights over Maine, at least for the
foreseeable future, are absolutely vital to maintaining the
readiness and effectiveness of this important weapons system,''
Garrett wrote.
   ``The Navy's going to do exactly what they intended all along,''
Eric Johnson, spokesman for the Coalition for the Cruise Missile
Referendum, said Thursday.
   Gov. John R. McKernan said he would ``be deciding what further
actions my administration should pursue to ensure that our views on
this matter are heard in Washington.''
   After the referendum, McKernan and members of the congressional
delegation all asked the Navy to halt the flights. The delegation
also asked the Navy to consider at least limiting the number of
flights and confining them to cold-weather months.
   The Navy has said it wanted to fly the missiles over Maine in
order to test them in cold weather over terrain like Maines,
according to Kirk Walder, spokesman for Rep. Olympia J. Snowe,
R-Maine.
   The missiles are launched from submarines at undisclosed
locations and fly a curving path over sparsely populated northern
Maine and southwestward to a Navy survival school near Saddleback
Mountain, northwest of Augusta, where they parachute to the ground.
   In his letter, dated Monday, Garrett told the delegation that
the Navy will ``take very practical steps to limit the number of
flights over Maine'' and ``make every effort to conduct these
flights only during the period of November to May.''
   ``That is not business as usual,'' said Bob Holsapple, spokesman
for the Navy's cruise missile project.
   The Navy will not say when the missile flights are scheduled,
said Holsapple.
   But Garrett's letter to the delegation said ``two flights are
planned during a single six-day launch window in the near future.''

   Socialist leader Takako Doi says she never aspired
to be the country's first female premier, but the idea of fixing
``defects'' left by decades of conservative rule is becoming more
appealing as elections draw near.
   ``There are so many things I would love to change if I were
prime minister,'' the Socialist Party chairwoman said in an
interview Friday. ``I would love to go to Washington and Moscow and
take new initiatives in this drastically changing world.''
   Ms. Doi, 61, has a chance to make history in this male-dominated
society, which votes next month for the crucial lower house of
Parliament, which elects the prime minister.
   Ms. Doi insists she never even held the ambition to be her
party's leader, much less prime minister.
   But as one of only 27 women against 737 men in the two houses of
Parliament, Ms. Doi is a highly visible politician. In addition to
her popularity among women, Ms. Doi's former position as a
university law professor has made her popular among liberal
intellectuals.
   If she becomes prime minister, it would be on the strength of
her popularity, combined with the weakness of the scandal-plagued
Liberal Democratic Party.
   The election, expected Feb. 18, is the most critical in Japan's
recent history because it is ``a once-in-a-lifetime chance for
opposition parties and people to end the 34-year rule by the
Liberal Democratic Party,'' Ms. Doi said, speaking in her Tokyo
office between a string of visitors from companies and media
organizations.
   Ms. Doi offers few specifics on what initiatives she might
propose, a sign of the political education she has gained since
1986, when she became the first woman to lead a major Japanese
party.
   But she has harsh criticism for the current leaderships'
policies, which she said threaten to make Japan a ``money
spreader'' without principles.
   Ms. Doi's personal popularity led her party to an unprecedented
gain in the upper house election last July, forcing the Liberal
Democrats into a minority in the chamber for the first time.
   The lower house is more powerful, and Ms. Doi's Socialists now
have only 85 of the 512 seats in it. The Liberal Democrats hold 295.
   The Socialists so far are fielding only 145 candidates, meaning
Ms. Doi would have to persuade other opposition parties to form a
coalition and back her to be prime minister. Ideological divides so
far have prevented agreement between centrist parties and the
Socialists.
   To attract public support and coalition partners, the Socialists
have given up some radical-leftist policy stances. Last week, the
party decided to withdraw its call for revolution from its
platform. It has also acknowledged Japan's armed forces and its
security treaty with the United States.
   Ms. Doi said she would strictly enforce Japan's non-nuclear
principles, which forbid nuclear weapons coming into the country.
It is widely believed U.S. warships with nuclear weapons move in
and out of naval bases in Japan, but the United States refuses to
confirm or deny the presence of such weapons.
   ``We will probably have to re-examine how the principle is
carried out now, and if there is a suspicion that U.S. forces are
bringing in nuclear arms even for transit purposes, we have to
demand confirmation,'' she said.
   She said she would not seek drastic changes in domestic and
foreign policies, but she has harsh words for the current
leadership.
   ``The long rule by a single party has left us many defects and
we will have to correct them somehow,''she said. ``But trying to
change everything overnight is not something we want.''
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, on a European trip where he
announced a sizable aid package to East European countries, is
``only spreading money around with no principle,'' Ms. Doi said.
   ``I feel Japan is left out of decision-making in the rapidly
changing world because of a lack of principle in our foreign
policy,'' she said. ``It is pitiful for the second-largest economy
not to be part of the decision-making of the world when it seeks
new directions.''
   ``It is time for us to restart with mutual understanding between
the people of Japan and foreign countries before we simply throw
money at them, or we will be always regarded only as a money
spreader,'' she added.
   Japan needs to prove to the world it is ``a democratic nation
and our democracy is fair and trustworthy by realizing a transition
of power in government for the first time in three decades,'' she
said. ``I have long said that transition of power is a proof of
democracy.''
   Ms. Doi, a 20-year veteran of Parliament, became Socialist
leader in 1986 after the party was crushed in the lower house
election and her predecessor resigned. The left and right wings of
the party could not agree on a successor, and Ms. Doi, who avoided
taking sides, was chosen.

   Veteran's Affairs Secretary Edward J.

serving as head of VA benefits programs.
   The decision, made Wednesday in an internal memorandum, follows
the withdrawal of Vogel as Derwinski's choice to become inspector
general for the department.
   A White House advisory panel concluded that Vogel's more than
four years of service as head of the $17-billion-a-year program
would force him to step back from many investigations his staff
would have to run.
   Derwinski said Vogel, 49, will report Feb. 5 to the Baltimore VA
Medical Center to begin preparations to become director of a major
VA medical center later this year.
   Vogel will be replaced Jan. 28 by Raymond Avent, deputy chief
benefits director for field operations. Avent will serve as an

Development</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cape Codders' pleas for someone to rein in
development on their fragile, sandy peninsula were officially
answered Friday with a new law creating the Cape Cod Commission.
   ``In 1991 _ 1992 at the latest, we are going to face a lot of
very, very tough growth pressures,'' Gov. Michael Dukakis said at a
Statehouse news conference before heading south to the ceremonial
signing of the Cape Cod Commission Act.
   Establishing a regulatory commission ``gives everybody a chance
to do it right,'' he said.
   Environmentalists, regular vacationers and homeowners have
worried about the future of the Cape, especially as condominiums
and shopping malls began springing up in profusion.
   The push for a way to regulate it all was led by Paul Tsongas
after he left the U.S. Senate. Now chairman of the Board of Regents
of Higher Education, Tsongas said Friday, that the campaign for
regulation of development was ``an almost evangelical effort to
give this place a sense of difference from every other place.''
   In November 1988, Barnstable County voters approved a referendum
calling for an agency to regulate development. The Legislature
later passed the law creating the commission.
   The panel will include 15 representatives appointed by boards of
selectmen in each of Cape's 15 towns; three appointees by Cape
county commissioners; and one gubernatorial appointee.
   The panel will have authority to reject development projects and
designate environmentally and historically sensitive areas. Any
appeals of its actions would go through the courts.
   Backers of the measure said that about half the Cape's 140,000
acres suitable for construction was already used up and predicted
the rest would be occupied in three decades.

<DATELINE>BRATISLAVA, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Vaclav Havel said
Friday the speedy withdrawal of Soviet troops is only one of a
``large package'' of ideas he'll take to Moscow on his first
official visit next month.
   At a news conference during his first presidential visit to the
Slovak captial of Bratislava, Havel declined to be more specific on
his agenda, saying he prefered to tell Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev his ideas personally.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Lubos Dobrovsky, an old friend of
Havel's in the Charter 77 human rights organization, said Tuesday
that Czechoslovakia's new coalition government wants the estimated
70,000 Soviet troops in the country to leave by the end of 1990.
   The Soviet troops entered Czechoslovakia with the Warsaw Pact
invasion that crushed reform in 1968 and stayed under two
agreements the new Prague government has declared null and void.
   ``The withdrawal of Soviet troops from Czechoslovakia is part of
a large package of interrelated topics and themes'' to be taken to
Moscow in February, Havel said. ``Unfortunately this is all I can
tell you now.''
   Havel said a forthcoming one-day visit to Poland will take him
to Warsaw and Gdansk and that he would discuss with the Poles ``the
return of the nations of the so-called Soviet bloc to Europe.''
   Havel and other former dissidents elevated to state and
government positions by Czechoslovakia's peaceful revolution have
moved swiftly to try to dismantle or alter structures imposed on
their nation by four decades of one-party rule, and to take a
different line in foreign policy.
   Havel's first visit abroad after his Dec. 29 inauguration took
him to East Germany and West Germany rather than the Soviet Union.
For his Communist predecessors, a trip to Moscow usually took
precedence.
   A new, freer atmosphere has pervaded the government and media in
Czechoslovakia.
   Asked by a Czechoslovak journalist what guarantees existed
against a return to totalitarian rule, Havel answered: ``The
guarantees are in yourselves. You are free citizens. You have to
defend the freedom you have won.''
   Havel struck a personal tone throughout the news conference, one
of his first in Czechoslovakia since becoming president.
   Answering a question about his personal life, for example, he
spoke freely of ``a long struggle'' he had to wage to get free of a
dominant mother. At another point, he joked about being banned from
Bratislava during his dissident years.
   ``Bratislava was forbidden for me for many years,'' Havel said.
``If I came here, it was really illegal. Here they even caught me
once and put me in jail for two days. I liked the jail very much in
comparison with the Prague detention cells ... I was very sorry
they let us go because they fed us Slovak dumplings.''
   The same jocular tone rang through his remarks to about 10,000
people who gathered in freezing temperatures to welcome him on the
Bratislava square where many of the anti-Communist demonstrations
took place during the revolution.
   The crowd laughed along with Havel as he and Slovak opposition
leader Milan Knazko joked about his transformation from jailed
dissident to head of state.

<TEXT>
   A colorful, easy-to-read version of the Koran in
comic book form has won approval from some Islamic authorities, but
one scholar has condemned it, calling the author ``a new Salman
Rushdie.''
   ``Si Le Coran M'etait Conte'' _ ``If the Koran Were Told To
Me,'' is geared to readers aged 12 to 16, said its author, Youssef
Seddik.
   The Koran is the sacred book of Islam. According to Islamic
belief, it contains the words of God as revealed to the prophet
Mohammed.
   The comic books, which cost about $10 each, have been approved
and even encouraged by some religious authorities such as Ayatollah
Mehdi Rouhani, spiritual leader of the Shiite Moslem community in
Europe.
   ``I don't see any problem with the comic books, as long as you
know there is a precedent _ an illustrated version of the Koran
published in Iran 15 years ago,'' Rouhani said in an interview at
his Paris home.
   Rouhani called comic books ``the language of the 20th century.''
   ``I'm all for comic books, and would encourage them if they do,
in fact, get across the idea of God to young people,'' he said.
   But Mohammed Faidallah, head of Islamic Jurisprudence at Kuwait
University's Islamic Studies faculty, was quoted Friday as saying
the comic books could spark a furor like that over Rushdie's novel,
``The Satanic Verses.''
   In February 1989, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said Rushdie
should die because his novel blasphemed Islam. Rushdie has been in
hiding ever since.
   Faidallah said the comic books constituted a ``criminal act that
ridicules the sanctity of the holy Koran,'' and called for their
condemnation, the Kuwait newspaper Al-Qabas reported.
   He was quoted as calling Seddik ``a new Salman Rushdie recruited
to carry out this ugly task.'' Faidallah urged Arab and Islamic
embassies in Paris ``to pressure official bodies there with a view
to halting such violation of Islamic values,'' the daily said.
   Seddik, a Tunisian-born journalist who has written extensively
on Arab culture, said Friday he was ``deeply saddened'' by
Faidallah's reaction and disputed the scholar's right to judge the
issue.
   ``Islam is my emotional and spiritual roots. Nothing, no one can
ever take it away from me,'' he said.
   ``I'm deeply attached to the principle that distinguishes Islam
from Judaiism and Christianity: that it does not accept the idea of
the clergy. Only the knowledge, competence and good intentions of
the humblest Moslem can judge our actions.''
   In an earlier interview, Seddik said he was motivated to adapt
the Koran because of his frustration from studying the text as a
child.
   ``I remember feeling very sad that we had to learn the text by
heart, without any comprehension or understanding of what it
meant,'' said Seddik, 46. ``I was one of the lucky ones _ my father
was a learned man and he would explain things to me at home.''
   Seddik said the drawings and simple language can help young
readers follow the narrative development of the Koran's many
episodes, while avoiding its ``inextricable forest of syntactic,
lexical and theological difficulties.''
   Volume One, ``The Cursed Peoples,'' contains vivid pictures of
dessert peoples worshiping idols, living in sin, and deaf to pleas
of the prophets to change their ways and worship a single God.
   The drawings, which Rouhani described as ``naive and
simplistic,'' are accompanied by exact quotations from the Koran,
complete with chapter and verse references. The prophets are not
represented, but evoked by flashes of light.
   Seddik said he was careful not to offend or blaspheme in any
way, and even destroyed 10,000 copies of a 1986 edition that
displeased religious leaders.
   The new version, he said, got the OK from religious bodies in
Algeria and Tunisia.
   A spokesman for the rector of the Grand Mosque in Paris was less
enthusiastic. ``Comic books dealing with transcendental issues have
no instructive value, and, in fact frustrate the development of the
adolescent imagination,'' said Jhaothy Hadjeddine Sari.
   ``Imposing an image of the transcendental on a young person is
tantamount to castration,'' he said. ``I can't see teaching the
Koran in comic books any more than I can imagine teaching
philospohy or math.''
   Seddik said his desire to publish the comic books was
politically motivated.
   ``The rise of Arab fundamentalism is partly a result of the way
the Koran is being taught as something opaque and incantatory,
understood by the elite few who run Islam like a secret society to
which only they have access,'' he said.
   Seddik said the wisdom of the Koran should be available to
everyone ``so people can draw their own conclusions and decide how
to live their lives.''
   Seddik admits that comic books violate one of the key tenants of
Islam: the reproduction of images. ``Of course, it's a taboo, but
I'm willing to assume full responsibility,'' he said.
   Seddik says he respects the sacredness of Islam.
   ``I don't blaspheme, I don't portray Aicha as a prostitute,'' he
said, referring to a passage in ``The Satanic Verses'' about
Mohammed's child bride that offended many Moslems.
   Seddik said the seven-volume project was financed by Hocine
Meddahi, an Algerian industrialist who lives in Paris. Three
volumes have already appeared, in French and Arabic, and an English
translation is in progress.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 2,000 paratroopers filled the sky
with light green parachutes Friday morning as they floated
earthward on their triumphant return home after invading Panama.
   Several thousand spectators roared with delight as the
parachutes popped open and the soldiers drifted 800 feet to the
ground from 20 C-141 transport planes.
   The commanding general, Lt. Gen. Carl Stiner, was the first to
jump as the planes swooped down to Fort Bragg's Sicily Drop Zone.
   ``Our experience gives meaning to the expression that freedom
isn't free,'' Stiner, his face painted with black and brown
camouflage smears and wearing a battle helmet, said during a
welcoming ceremony at the drop zone.
   Stiner praised the 23 soldiers killed in the invasion, including
four from Fort Bragg, as well as those injured.
   ``Everyone knew there would be personal danger but not a single
one hestitated to go or to enter a battle,'' Stiner said. ``You
would have been very proud of your soldiers. No one has ever been
more disciplined under fire or more mature in carrying out their
duties.''
   As the 1,924 soldiers approached the ground, they lowered their
packs and rifles on a line to lighten the load of the landing.
Stiner said the troopers' backpacks weighed 100 pounds when fully
loaded with ammunition, as they were during the invasion.
   The soldiers, wearing battle gear, gathered their parachutes
after landing and got into military formation.
   Four soldiers received minor injuries in the jump. Master Sgt.
Michael H. Hartt, a spokesman, said he had no details but usually
the injuries involve turned ankles.
   Families and soldiers had 30 minutes to greet one another before
the troops resumed formation to march to their barracks and turn in
weapons and gear.
   Staff Sgt. Vicki Zamora, 27, one of two women on the division's
manifest, was stationed in a Panamanian building that was under
mortar fire the day before she arrived.
   She was greeted by her husband, Gus Zamora, 34, and their three
children. While her children tugged at her uniform and told what
they received for Christmas, she said she felt good about leaving
the children because ``they were in good hands being with their
daddy.''
   Asked if women should fight in combat, she replied: ``We all
train as a team and we need to fight as a team.''
   Stiner said everyone in the invasion came under fire because the
troops attacked 27 targets simultaneously.
   ``I'm not going to get into a debate on what women can and
cannot do because they amaze me every day,'' Stiner said at a news
conference.
   Signs dotted the crowd proclaiming welcome messages, including
``Leo: Super Duper Paratrooper,'' and ``Welcome Home, Pookie.''
   The fiancee of one paratrooper said she was told he ``wanted
some pizza'' because he had eaten so many bananas and pineapples in
Panama.
   Karie Wilkinson, 20, said she planned a quiet welcome with Pfc.
William Short, 22, and would open Christmas presents and gifts for
their Jan. 26 wedding.
   Ms. Wilkinson said she often worried that Short wouldn't return
from Panama in time for the wedding.
   Capt. Lewis Boone said the soldiers jumped on their return
because, ``Their primary means of deployment is jumping. They will
jump whenever possible _ over here, over there, anywhere.''
   The homecoming crowd was taken to the drop zone before dawn to
be in place for the soldiers' return. A military band played ``God
Bless America'' and patriotic marching songs while waiting for the
planes to arrive.
   The troops were involved in the Dec. 20 invasion of Panama that
resulted in the ouster of Panamanian dictator Gen. Manuel Noreiga.
   The 82nd Airborne Division troops conducted a night parachute
assault onto Tocumen-Torrijos airfield east of Panama City, secured
the airfield, and moved out within hours to secure other targets,
officials said.

<HEAD>Yugoslav News Agency Reports State of Emergency in Albania</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug
reported Friday that Albanian authorities had imposed ``extremely
strict'' security measures in their isolated Communist country.
   Albanian TV, monitored in Belgrade, did not mention any special
measures.
   Milisav Milic, a reporter for Belgrade TV from Yugoslavia's
Kosovo province that borders Albania, told The Associated Press
that ``frequent sound of firearms'' was heard Friday from the
direction of Albania.
   Tanjug and Belgrade TV said that ``something is apparently
happening'' in Albania and that rare travelers from that country
report of ``brutal'' measures against dissent there.
   ``Albanian authorities in an effort to prevent unrest against
the regime have imposed extremely strict control measures in the
country,'' Tanjug said.
   It said the security measures ``can be termed a state of
emergency,'' but did not say when they were were imposed.
   Tanjug gave no sourcing for its information, but Belgrade TV
said its information came from unconfirmed reports from diplomats
and travelers.
   As the last bastion of Stalinism in Eastern Europe, Albania is
viewed by some Western analysts as the next country to experience
radical change. But its isolation and small population of 3 million
are among the factors that make Albania different from other
Communist countries in the region.
   The Balkan nation's borders are virtually closed to foreign
travelers, although in recent months, some closely supervised tour
groups have been allowed in.
   Albanian media has been silent about reports of possible popular
unrest that have been carried in the past few days in Yugoslav and
Greek media.
   Petrag Simo, an Albanian diplomat in Belgrade on Friday strongly
denied such reports.
   ``All these are regretable rumors which have absolutely no
substance,'' Simo told the AP.
   The nightly news program of Albanian state TV monitored in
Belgrade made no mention of any disturbances or special security
measures having been imposed.
   But Milic said a telephone interview that an ethnic Albanian
returning home to Kosovo from Albania told of demonstrations in the
towns of Durres, Shkoder and Korcha ``in the last couple of days.''
   The Albanian also told Milic that leaflets by ``dissatisfied
Albanian military officers'' had appeared in the capital of Tirana.
No details of their contents were available.
   The Yugoslav newspaper Politika reported Thursday that a state
of emergency had been delcared in Shkoder, Albania's second largest
city. It said that Shkoder, 60 miles northwest of Tirana on the
Yugoslav border, is the center of dissent in Albania and that
several protests were reported in the city over the past three
years.
   On Wednesday, the Albanian daily Zeri I Popullit accused emigres
of trying to foment unrest, saying they wanted to restore the
pre-World War II monarchy and vowing Albania would never abandon
Communism.
   Albania is the last country in Eastern Europe to revere Josef
Stalin, whose giant statue stands in Tirana.

   Vice President Dan Quayle worked Friday to
firm up an itinerary for his fence-mending trip to Latin America,
but many diplomats from the region remained unconvinced that his
personal touch would soothe their governments' ire over the U.S.
invasion of Panama.
   Some, speaking on condition of anonymity, said President Bush
would accomplish more by withdrawing invasion troops from Panama
than by dispatching his vice president on a friendship tour.
   Sentiment ran particularly strong in Venezuela, where some
officials said it was ``inappropriate'' that Quayle be sent to
proffer explanations before the invasion forces leave and a head of
state is installed through elections or congressional appointment.
The current president, Guillermo Endara _ whose previous election
was voided by Gen. Manuel Noriega _ was installed by the United
States the day of the invasion.
   One Venezuelan diplomat said Bush should ``wait more time in
order that the situation in Panama gets better, and then begin new
conversations about the relations between the United States and
Latin Americans _ but not now.''
   It was not clear if Quayle will visit Caracas or simply meet
with the Venezuelan president, Carlos Andres Perez, at one of the
upcoming presidential inaugurations in Uruguay, Brazil or Chile.
All are to take place in March.
   Administration officials on Friday were working on the
itinerary. Only Quayle's previously scheduled trip to the Jan. 27
inauguration in Honduras was announced.
   No country has refused to talk to the vice president, Quayle's
press secretary, David Beckwith, insisted.
   ``No country will refuse to say welcome,'' the Venezuelan source
concurred. ``But maybe they say, `You are welcome, but not today,
maybe tomorrow.' Never, never will any country of Latin America say
you are not welcome. It's not polite.''
   Some countries said Quayle's visits at least would show that
wants to take the sting out of what many Latins viewed as a
violation of Panama's sovereignty.
   But others said Quayle can expect a cool reaction.
   ``It won't be easy,'' said an Uruguayan diplomatic source.
   ``People are very skeptical about it. You invade and then you
try to convince us that an invasion is not an invasion. He tries to
patronize us,'' said a Costa Rican official, referring to President
Bush.
   The official said that Costa Rica, a strongly pro-U.S. country,
will welcome Quayle, nonetheless. The official predicted South
American reaction will be ``very, very cold. Probably they will
tell him that was an invasion and we don't need any explanation.''
   Another Latin diplomatic source said, ``The people of Latin
America will be more comfortable if the United States gets its
troops home as soon as possible and helps Panama carry out an
election.''
   ``Something had to be done with Noriega, but that doesn't mean
an invasion _ an uninvited invasion,'' said a Bolivian diplomat.
The source said it was hoped that Quayle would have ``something
significant to say'' beyond already voiced rationales.
   Bush announced last week that he was dispatching Quayle to try
to convince Latin neighbors of ``the truth _ and that is that we
are not just reverting to just a willful ... use of force that has
no rationale.''
   While the Latin countries shared Bush's disdain for Noriega, now
held on federal drug charges in Miami, they were virtually
unanimous in publicly deploring the use of military force to topple
him.
   Venezuela urged members of the Organization of American States
to withhold their recognition of the Endara government until the
U.S. invasion troops are withdrawn. The OAS didn't go that far, but
nonetheless denounced the U.S. operation.
   In 1958, Vice President Richard Nixon was confronted by a
rock-throwing mob in Caracas during a goodwill tour to Latin
America. Rioters shattered windows in his limousine and tried to
drag him and his wife, Pat, from the car before the motorcade
escaped.
   But one administration official, who also declined
identification, said that ``Just as we're always happy to
accommodate the visits by Caribbean and Latin leaders, I'm sure
they will be pleased to welcome the vice president.''

<TEXT>
   The United States is coming under attack from
some church groups in Latin America for its Dec. 20 invasion of
Panama.
   The Latin American Council of Churches, in a letter addressed to
U.S. Christians, decried the invasion as a ``terrorist action''
that violated Panama's right to control its own destiny.
   In a separate statement, the Ecumenical Committee in Panama, a
2-year-old coalition of Methodists, Episcopalians, Lutherans and
Baptists, said the U.S. invasion was not the most competent way to
solve the crisis, and that it represents a threat to the
sovereignty of the Panamanian nation.
   The letters were released Friday by the National Council of
Churches, the nation's largest ecumenical organization with
membership including most major Protestant denominations. A council
delegation is to visit Panama on Tuesday at the request of the
Ecumenical Committee in Panama.
   The invasion also has been criticized by some U.S. church groups.
   James A. Hamilton, general secretary of the council, said in a
letter to President Bush that the action risked ``pointless losses
of Panamanian and American lives, as well as the isolation of our
nation from a world gradually turning its back on the use of
military might as a means of settling disputes.''
   The Rev. Thom White Wolfe Fassett, general secretary of the
Board of Church and Society for the United Methodist Church, said,
``Unilateral intervention, no matter its validity, can never be
supported.''
   Archbishop Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, chairman of the
International Policy Committee of the United States Catholic
Conference, said U.S. bishops support the plea by Panama's Catholic
bishops for the U.S. government to withdraw its forces from Panama
as soon as possible and to help rebuild the Panamanian economy.
   U.S. officials have said their objectives in the invasion were
to oust Panamanian dictator Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, protect
American lives, safeguard the Panama Canal treaties and restore
democracy to Panama.
   The official death toll by U.S. count is 314 members of the
Panamanian Defense Forces, 220 civilians, 23 American soldiers and
three U.S. civilians. U.S. forces suffered 324 wounded, while 124
Panamanian soldiers are listed as wounded.

<HEAD>Nation's Auction Houses Paint Rosy Picture of Record Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. auction houses sold more than $1.5 billion
worth of art last year and chalked up their best-selling season
ever thanks to a broader, more educated audience, art dealers said.
   Two Pablo Picasso paintings sold for more than $40 million each
to become the third- and fourth-most expensive paintings ever, but
the not-so-wealthy art lover also contributed to the record sales
by buying works that cost thousands rather than than millions.
   When the final bang of the gavel sounded on U.S. art auction
sales for the season, the total came to $1.53 billion, nearly
double last year's total, Leonard's Annual Price Index of Art
Auctions reported this week.
   The total number of art lots sold was 33,000 in 1989, down by
more than 5,000 from the previous year. Experts said both the
limited art supply and increased consumer interest stoked the
season's record-breaking sales.
   ``When my grandfather ran the business, his clientele was the
very top 5 percent of the upper class,'' said Abbot William Vose,
president of Vose Gallery, which opened in Providence, R.I., in
1841 and relocated to Boston 40 years later.
   ``The clientele is very broad-based now, with even the lower
middle-class buying art,'' he said. ``Art education in even grade
schools, up through high schools, has played a good part in
focusing attention on American art and other arts, and has made a
difference in attendance at museums and art shows.''
   Sotheby's Holdings Inc. in New York last year sold the third-and
fourth-top moneymakers ever with ``Yo Picasso,'' a self-portrait of
the artist that earned $47.85 million, and his ``Au Lapin Agile,''
which went for $40.7 million, said Robin Riley-Ahrens, the house's
spokesman.
   Picasso's ``Pierrette's Wedding'' went for $48.9 million in
November to earn the title of the second-most expensive painting
ever, but it was sold at the Drouot-Montaigne auction house in
Paris and thus not included in the U.S. figures.
   The world's most expensive painting, Vincent van Gogh's
``Irises,'' was sold by Sotheby's in 1987 for $53.9 million. The
auction house disclosed Thursday, however, that it lent Australian
tycoon Alan Bond $27 million to buy the 1889 painting; that as
collateral Bond posted the picture he was going to buy, and that
Bond has not paid off the loan. Sotheby's said it was abandoning
the loan policy, which many critics say artificially inflates
artwork prices.
   ``About 20 percent of the art sold at auction went for below
$1,000,'' said Susan Theran, publisher of Leonard's Annual Price
Index, an industry database that provides information annually on
art auction prices.
   ``Art is affordable, and people are finding that out,'' she
said. ``People are developing their tastes and buying books on how
to purchase art.''
   However, sales were still chiefly pushed to their record heights
by purchases in the $1 million-plus market, Theran said.
   Final tally for the 1989 selling season showed 240 lots of
artworks worth more than $1 million were sold, compared with 84
similarly priced lots in the previous year, Theran said. Sales for
the 240 lots was $779 million, more than triple the 1988 figure of
$213.5 million for the 84 lots.

   Columbia's astronauts salvaged a
valuable space laboratory today, snaring it with a 50-foot robot
arm and saving it from a fiery doom in the atmosphere.
   ``You've made several scientists quite happy,'' Mission Control
told the space shuttle crew. ``LDEF is finally coming home.''
   The astronauts rescued the Long Duration Exposure Facility by
steering Columbia alongside it and having mission specialist Bonnie
Dunbar reach out and grab it with the wire fingers of the
spaceship's mechanical arm.
   The capture occurred 201 miles above the Earth as the two
spacecraft raced in formation at more than 17,400 mph.
   While commander Dan Brandenstein held the shuttle steady, Dunbar
used a television camera on the end of the robot to gingerly guide
the fingers to a grappling device on the side of the bus-sized
satellite.
   The television pictures, beamed to Earth, showed the tense final
minutes but Columbia's position kept it from showing the actual
capture.
   After snaring LDEF, Dunbar slowly turned the satellite on the
arm for nearly four hours so all of its exterior experiments could
be photographed. She then used the arm to gently lower the
satellite into the cargo bay this afternoon.
   At 3:50 p.m. EST, Mission Control reported that all five latches
in the cargo bay used to hold LDEF had been secured.
   Astronauts have recovered orbiting satellites before, but never
one as big as LDEF, which is 30 feet long and weighs 11 tons.
   Had they failed to rescue LDEF, trackers said the 57 experiments
on board would have been lost as gravity pulled the satellite to a
flaming re-entry into Earth's atmosphere about March 9.
   Dunbar reported that some experiments had suffered wear and tear
from their six years in space, being pounded by micrometeoroids,
blasted by cosmic rays and corroded by atomic oxygen.
   ``Looks like a couple panels have some loose foil _ loose foil
pulled away from the side,'' she said. ``A lot of coatings look
like they may be gone.''
   Brandenstein later reported, ``We've got a whole lot of little
specks of foil coming at us from LDEF.''
   That's exactly what scientists and engineers want to know. How
many of the materials and experiments withstood the long exposure
will help them design America's space station Freedom and other
future long-duration spacecraft.
   At the control center, flight director Al Pennington said the
loose foil over an experiment to measure heavy ions in space
appeared to be the only damage, based on a preliminary look at the
TV pictures.
   ``It's a good-looking spacecraft,'' he said. ``The scientists
I've talked with are very, very pleased. It looks like we have a
very valuable piece of science there in our grasp.''
   The successful retrieval ended a celestial chase that began with
Columbia's launch on Tuesday and covered 1.3 million miles during
which the astronauts circled the globe 50 times.
   LDEF had traveled 854 million miles since it was launched by
another shuttle crew in 1984.
   Television beamed from the shuttle during the approach showed a
stable LDEF silhouetted strikingly against a blue Earth and looming
ever larger as Brandenstein and pilot Jim Wetherbee made the final
maneuvers. Sunlight gleamed off its trays of science and technology
experiments.
   ``We have a tally-ho on LDEF,'' Mission Control told the crew
when the closeup view of the satellite first appeared on the screen.
   Dunbar initially held the satellite on the end of the arm,
poised above the cargo bay, so it could be photographed extensively.
   After catching up about an hour before the retrieval,
Brandenstein had maneuvered the spaceship to a position about 400
feet directly above the target, with the shuttle flying upside
down, its open cargo bay facing the satellite.
   Brandenstein and Wetherbee then pulsed their steering jets to
gingerly approach the LDEF as Dunbar flexed the arm.
   Before tucking the huge payload into the cargo bay, Dunbar was
to hold it on the end of the robot arm for more than four hours,
twisting it slowly, while mission specialists Marsha Ivins and
David Low photographed the experiments from every angle.
   Brandenstein reported the astronauts first spotted LDEF Thursday
night. It was glinting in the sunlight nearly 200 miles away, he
said, and was ``as bright as could be.''
   When the crew awakened early today, LDEF was 108 miles in front
of them and Brandenstein and Wetherbee gradually narrowed the gap
with a series of intricate engine-firing maneuvers.
   Shortly before 7 a.m., observers at Cape Canaveral watched for
about two minutes as Columbia and LDEF passed directly overhead,
both shining brightly in the reflective rays of the rising sun.
They were about 14 miles apart.
   Two miles out, the astronauts sent to Earth the first television
pictures of the target.
   Early today, a chorus of space center workers sang ``Bring it
home, bring it home, bring it home,'' to the tune of ``Let It
Snow,'' to waken the space travelers early today.
   It was a reminder that Columbia originally was to have been in
orbit at Christmastime and that the astronauts had promised to
bring the satellite back as a holiday gift to all those with
experiments on board.
   Launched in April 1984 by another shuttle crew, it was to have
been retrieved 10 months later. But scheduling problems and the
1986 Challenger disaster combined to delay the rescue
   The five astronauts were to spend a week processing medical
materials, observing Earth and conducting other experiments before
returning home Jan. 19, when a landing in darkness was scheduled
for 2:57 a.m. PST at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.

   The new government of Prime Minister
V.P. Singh said Friday it will support petitioners challenging the
previous leadership's $470 million settlement with Union Carbide
for the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster.
   Law and Justice Minister Dinesh Goswami said the former
government of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had ``no authority or
right to arrive at (a) settlement which extinguishes all rights of
the affected victims in respect of criminal liability.
   ``The government is also of the view that human life in India is
not so cheap that the worst industrial disaster in the world ...
could be compensated by an amount of $470 million,'' he said.
   The Feb. 15, 1989, settlement before India's Supreme Court was
accepted as ``full and final'' from the U.S. multinational for the
gas leak that killed at least 3,598 people and injured 20,000
others in the central city of Bhopal.
   The settlement absolved the Danbury, Conn.-based company of
further civil or criminal liability. Under Indian law, however, it
is subject to review by the court if challenged.
   Gas victims and activists groups challenged the settlement on
two grounds: that the Gandhi government had no right to declare
itself the sole representative of all claims arising from the
disaster; and the settlement itself was unfair.
   On Dec. 22, 20 days after Singh took office, the Supreme Court
ruled the government did indeed have the right to be the claimants'
sole representative.
   Goswami said the government will support the victims in the
other challenge to the settlement, which is pending before the
court.
   ``The government is of the considered view that the
constitutional and legal rights of victims to seek such judicial
remedies as are available to them under the law of the land ...
cannot be bartered away,'' he said.
   ``Neither the Union of India nor a settlement arrived at between
the Union of India and any other party could extinguish this
inalienable right of the victims,'' he said.
   Goswami, however, refused to comment on whether the settlement
would be scrapped, saying that the case was before the Supreme
Court.
   An attorney whose firm represented Union Carbide in the
prolonged legal maneuvering after the disaster said he had no
immediate comment.
   ``I have to communicate the government's statement to my clients
and I am in no position to say anything,'' said the attorney, who
spoke on condition of not being identified further.
   Robert Berzok, Union Carbide's chief spokesman in Danbury, said
the company had only seen news reports of the government's
statements and was not prepared to comment in detail.
   ``All I can tell you is there is no information that suggests
that the assumptions made in ordering the settlement were
incorrect,'' he said.
   The Indian government, acting under a 1985 law making it the
sole representative of the Bhopal victims, originally sued Union
Carbide for $3 billion in damages.
   It also filed charges of criminal negligence against top
executives of the U.S.-based Union Carbide Corp., and of its local
subsidiary, Union Carbide of India Ltd., for allegedly causing the
leak.
   The multinational company said the leak was the result of
sabotage by a disgruntled employee.
   Suits and countersuits ensued in several Indian courts until the
nation's Supreme Court in New Delhi took jurisdiction of the case,
and the criminal charges were eventually dropped. The Gandhi
government and Union Carbide agreed on the $470 million settlement,
which the Supreme Court accepted 11 months ago.
   Union Carbide deposited the full settlement with the court, but
distribution of the money was delayed because of the various
challenges and the bureaucracy involved in deciding who was
entitled to the money.
   At least 500,000 people have asked for compensation, according
to Madhya Pradesh state officials processing the claims in Bhopal,
a city of one million.
   Goswami said the government would pay interim compensation to
victims in areas near the pesticide plant from where the toxic gas
leaked. The amount, he said, would be independent of the amount
deposited by Union Carbide with the Supreme Court.
   Some of the claimants lived thousands of miles from Bhopal but
claimed they suffered ``mental anguish'' over the disaster.
   Most of the undisputed sufferers are the poor shantytown
dwellers who live in mud and burlap huts across the street from the
now-closed Union Carbide plant.

<TEXT>
   Retail sales increased just 5 percent in 1989,
the slowest gain in seven years, and holiday spending was the
weakest since 1985, the government reported Friday.
   Analysts said the figures reflected a steepening slide in
consumer spending, once an area of strength in last year's economy.
   ``It seems that consumer spending is dead in the water,'' said
Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities Inc., in
Chicago.
   ``The consumer basically is in hiding,'' said Walter Loeb,
retail analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., in New York, who credited
bargain promotions for most of the consumer spending which did
occur.
   The Commerce Department said retail sales totaled $1.71 trillion
last year. The 5 percent gain compared with 7.1 percent in 1988,
and was the slowest since the 2.9 percent rise in the recession
year of 1982.
   December sales rose only 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted
$144.4 billion, after rising 0.5 percent in November.
   Because many consumers now begin their Christmas shopping just
after Thanksgiving, many analysts combine sales in both months to
assess holiday spending. Half or more of retail profits come from
business done between Thanksgiving and Christmas.
   The combined November-December sales were just 3.8 percent above
the same period of 1988, which posted a 6.6 percent jump over the
same months of 1987. The 1989 holiday gain was the most sluggish
since the 2.9 percent rise in 1985.
   Economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a New York
government securities dealer, said consumers are spending only when
they get a bargain.
   ``That's obvious in the case of auto incentives and all of the
discounts at Christmas,'' Jones said.``Consumers did come out of
their shell and spend at Christmas but only because department
stores offered them discounts.''
   Many analysts said consumer spending will continue on that
track, at least through the first half of the year.
   Sales of durable goods _ big-ticket items such as cars and
household appliances expected to last more than three years _ fell
0.6 percent in December after edging up 0.1 percent in November.
   Durable goods, which often are financed by loans, have been
particularly affected by tighter Federal Reserve credit policies
and were the subject of vast promotions, especially in the
automobile sector.
   But most auto incentives ended with the introduction of 1990
models in October and motor vehicle sales dropped 0.7 percent in
December on top of a 0.4 percent decline in November.
   Auto sales, which represent about 22 percent of retail sales,
ended the year up just 2.2 percent compared to a 10.3 percent gain
in 1988. It was the lowest since sales actually declined 8.1
percent in 1980.
   Excluding autos, overall sales in December were up 0.4 percent.
   Sales of durable building materials rose 0.1 percent on top of a
0.7 percent rise in November, while furniture and other home
furnishings declined 1 percent after a 0.7 percent increase a month
earlier.
   Sales of non-durable goods rose 0.6 percent after gaining 0.8
percent in November.
   Sales were up 0.6 percent at grocery stores and 1.3 percent at
gasoline stations, both due in part to higher prices. Apparel sales
advanced 0.1 percent.
   But despite the holiday season, department store sales were down
0.4 percent in December. Sales at restaurants and bars were down
0.9 percent, and at drug stores, down 1 percent.
   For the three months from October through December, overall
retail sales were up 3.6 percent.

   Downtown developers are offering a proposal made
in heaven. The Old St. Mary's Catholic Church and Self Park will be
a 12-story blessing to commuters and parishioners _ 10 floors of
parking space on a two-story church.
   The proposed development includes classrooms, priest's quarters,
parish offices and two chapels complete with altars and pews for
425 worshipers. But in place of the traditional spire, the complex
would have parking for 805 vehicles.
   An ersatz bell tower topped with a stainless steel cross
actually will contain the elevator to the 10 open-air parking
floors.
   ``The building will look like a church,'' said William McBride,
the project's architect. ``We want the parking garage to look
secondary.''
   But the economics of high-priced downtown real estate played
more of a role in the creation than did divine inspiration.
   Church officials and their consultants came to Standard Parking
Corp. with the idea for the development to get more value out of
their land.
   Under the deal, Standard Parking and the developer, Stein &amp; Co.,
get a prime downtown site in a growing market for off-street
parking. The parishioners of Old St. Mary's would get a new church
worth $5.5 million, essentially for free.
   ``It's a win-win situation,'' said Rev. Thomas J. Dove, the
pastor.
   The diocese retains ownership of the property and the first two
floors of the development, while Standard Parking and Stein own the
parking deck.
   Besides the free church, the parish would get a 2.5 percent
share of the parking receipts and free parking for churchgoers on
Sunday and selected holy days, said Constance K. Dickinson, vice
president of marketing for Stein.
   Two of the developers' other parking decks play on themes. One
in the theater district has floors named after musicals with tunes
from the shows playing on each level. Another has floors with city
names and theme songs to identify them.
   The collaboration prompted many religious references for floors,
but the developers decided to use titles from famous books to
identify the floors, Ms. Dickinson said.
   ``We gave up on finding 10 saints in Chicago,'' Dove said.
   The need for parking space thwarted another of Dove's
tounge-in-cheek suggestions _ three parking levels named heaven,
purgatory and hell.
   Warshauer said the developers held several meetings with
parishioners to make sure the creation would be acceptable.
   Dove told uncertain parishioners that it would be difficult to
raise the $3 million or $4 million needed to rebuild the old church
already on the lot, which consists of two old commercial buildings
that were converted beginning in 1961.
   The parish itself, founded in 1833, is the oldest Roman Catholic
parish in the city.
   If the City Council approves the plan, demolition of the old
structure could begin by summer and the church would be ready about
18 months later.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told
Lithuanian farmers Friday they would be better off if their
republic stayed in the Soviet Union, but pro-independence
protesters again confronted him and local leaders accused him of
laying a ``propaganda trap.''
   Gorbachev made the pitch at a collective farm in Siauliai, 125
miles northwest of Vilnius, a day after promising a national vote
on secession but predicting Lithuanians would choose to remain in
the Soviet Union once they understood the difficulties involved in
seceding after 50 years.
   The Soviet leader arrived in the tiny Baltic republic of 3.7
million people Thursday for a three-day mission to try to solve one
the biggest crises of his tenure: the swelling tide of independence
and its potential effects nationwide.
   There were signs Lithuanians were not listening to his appeals
to seek a solution not by seceding but by remaining in the union.
   Gorbachev was greeted at the Bridai farm by protesters carrying
banners that read, ``We are for an Independent Lithuania!'' and
``Our Aim is the Independence of Lithuania.''
   After an exasperating day of trying to get his message across,
Gorbachev showed his sense of humor was intact, telling the
demonstrators: ``OK, I have read them all, take a rest.''
   The crowd interrupted him frequently, and by the end of the
discussion, his smile had disappeared and his face was grim. The
scene was broadcast by state-run TV.
   Foreign reporters were not permitted to accompany Gorbachev in
Siauliai because it is a military region closed to foreigners.
   Later, as the president arrived at the Taulus TV factory in
Siauliai, a crowd shouting ``Freedom to Lithuania!'' greeted him.
He shrugged and told them sarcastically, ``And you say you are not
free!''
   Lithuanian activists, who have wide popular support, say they
want to restore the independence their homeland enjoyed between the
world wars. In 1940 dictator Josef Stalin absorbed Lithuania and
the two other Baltic states, Estonia and Latvia, under a secret
deal with Nazi Germany.
   Vytautas Landsbergis, head of the pro-independence Sajudis
political movement, on Friday dismissed Gorbachev's announcement of
a day earlier that a secession law was being prepared.
   ``It's a propaganda trap,'' Landsbergis, who is also a member of
the Congress of People's Deputies parliament in Moscow, told a news
conference. ``If we get entangled in the mechanism of seceding from
the Soviet Union, we automatically act as if we were (now) a legal
part of the Soviet Union.''
   Gorbachev noted Thursday that the Soviet Constitution guarantees
each of the country's 15 republics the right to secede, and
revealed that the first draft of a law detailing the process of
secession has been written. He promised a national discussion and a
referendum on the proposal.
   On Friday, he warned the farmers, huddled around him on a
street, to think about the consequences of secession.
   ``It will be written in the Soviet Constitution (that) there are
14, not 15, union republics. This will mean a split, and there will
be no place for you in that union,'' he said, as his wife, Raisa,
and Lithuanian Communist Party chief Algirdas Brazauskas stood
beside him.
   He then cited economic factors that he implied would make it
better for Lithuanians to remain in the union.
   ``Our ties within the country are very close,'' he said. ``This
cannot be compared with what they have in the European market. We
have a colossal division of labor.''
   Lithuania receives 70 percent to 100 percent of its energy, oil
and metals from the Russian federation, Gorbachev told the farmers.
Brazauskas, who supports the drive for independence, chimed in that
the prices Lithuania receives are far below world levels.
   Gorbachev said he favors restoring the republic's sovereignty
and economic independence but warned that if Lithuania secedes,
``Not only Lithuania will suffer.''
   ``If you think I want to frighten Lithuania, then you are
mistaken,'' Gorbachev said. ``Russia, Byelorussia, everybody will
suffer.''
   On Thursday night, Gorbachev's announcement to Lithuanian
intellectuals that the law on secession was being drafted was met
with applause and broad smiles.
   ``I favor the existence of a mechanism (to secede) to stop this
speculation ... let there be a choice by the people,'' Gorbachev
said in comments broadcast on Lithuanian TV.
   He gave no details of the law, but implied it would require a
republic contemplating secession to make detailed plans, set out
the exact costs, both financial and in terms of human dislocation,
and then hold an election.
   His voice cracking with emotion, Gorbachev told the
intellectuals: ``You have relations with all the republics, with
all states. You must resolve all the problems, such as what to do
with the people who want to leave, and who will get the homes and
the jobs they leave behind.''
   ``Now, people don't know what awaits them,'' he said. ``They've
been told fairy tales, Russian fairy tales and Lithuanian fairy
tales.''
   Instead of euphoric calls for freedom, Gorbachev said, people
should be given concrete information on how secession would take
place and ``what they have to live through.''
   He predicted Lithuanians would reject secession in favor of his
proposal for a loose Soviet federation. He said Lithuanians would
never feel free if their lives improved at the cost of harming
ethnic Russians, Poles and other non-Lithuanians in the republic.
   When his audience objected, Gorbachev's voice rose. ``It will
never happen,'' he nearly shouted. ``You are a civilized people.
Your conscience won't let you.''
   But Kazimieras Motieka, a Sajudis leader and member of the
Supreme Soviet legislature, said Gorbachev had badly miscalculated.
   ``No economic blockades, no threats, no gloomy predictions will
stop the Lithuanian people,'' Motieka told a news conference.
   Gorbachev's announcement is likely to encourage independence
movements in Latvia, Estonia, Georgia and other non-Russian
republics in addition to Lithuania.
   By going to Lithuania, Gorbachev put his personal prestige on
the line as never before in nearly five years in power, appearing
in a republic that openly disagrees with him and is unlikely to be
moved by his appeals. He was sent to the republic by the
Moscow-based Central Committee to seek reversal of the Lithuanian
Communist Party's decision last month to split off from the
national party.

<HEAD>U.S. Joins South Americans in Drafting Drug Summit Resolution</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. delegates met behind closed
doors with their counterparts from three cocaine-producing
countries Friday to craft a tough anti-narcotics resolution for a
February summit.
   Representatives from Bolivia, Peru and Colombia presented the
Americans, who arrived Thursday night in this semitropical city in
the midsection of South America, with a draft document that calls
for more U.S. aid as well as a stepped-up battle against
trafficking, conference sources said.
   Work on a final text was expected to be completed on Saturday,
according to delegates.
   The resolution was to remain confidential until it is formally
signed at the Feb. 15 one-day summit in Cartagena, Colombia, by
Presidents Bush, Virgilio Barco of Colombia and Jaime Paz Zamora of
Bolivia.
   Peruvian President Alan Garcia has said he will attend only if
U.S. occupying troops are withdrawn from Panama.
   But the chief of the Peruvian delegation in Santa Cruz, Foreign
Ministry subsecretary Armando Lecaro, played down Garcia's
ultimatum. He said his country would send a high-level delegation
to the summit in any case and planned to fully participate.
   The pre-summit meeting was being held under strict security at a
hotel in this cocaine-trafficking city 350 miles from La Paz, the
capital of landlocked Bolivia.
   Michael Skol, the State Department's Assistant Under-Secretary
for Inter-American Affairs, headed the U.S. delegation. He declined
any comment to reporters and the U.S. ambassador to Bolivia, Robert
Gelbard, said only that he was optimistic about the outcome of the
conference.
   The three South American countries' representatives have been
gathered since Wednesday making changes in an original resolution
drawn up by the United States.
   The original document recognized the need for more U.S. aid, but
tied it to each country's performance in battling trafficking,
according to a copy obtained by The Associated Press.
   The document also stressed the need for a militarization of the
war on drugs, saying each country must commit armed forces to the
anti-narcotics campaign.
   Some cocaine-producing countries have been reluctant to involve
their military in the battle against traffickers, fearing the
corruption of top officers. In Bolivia, army leaders seized power
in 1980 with the backing of wealthy cocaine dealers and ruled for a
year.
   According to U.S. and Bolivian delegates, speaking on condition
they not be identified, the three South American countries made
several major changes in the U.S. proposal, weakening the link
between economic aid and performance and watering down references
to militarization.
   Informed of the changes, U.S. officials in Washington made an
urgent appeal, through the Bolivian embassy, for the South
Americans to restore the bulk of the original document, and this
was done late Thursday, according to the delegates.
   Bolivia and Peru, impoverished nations where most of the world's
coca leaf is grown, are emphasizing the need for money to develop
their countries and offer growers profitable alternatives.
   Colombia, a richer country that serves as a center for smuggling
and processing, is pushing for more funds for interdiction.
   All three countries maintain the United States must make a
concerted effort to control domestic consumption of cocaine.

<TEXT>
   A tribal leader fighting for a homeland
in northeastern India said Friday his followers will raise a
500,000-member volunteer force to make the state government cave in
to their demands.
   ``We will not compromise for anything less than a separate
homeland,'' said Upendra Kumar Bharma, who heads the homeland
movement of the predominantly animist Bobo tribes.
   Bharma and 15 other Bodo leaders met government officials in New
Delhi on Thursday and demanded a separate state in the Indian
nation. The demand was turned down, and the tribal leaders vowed to
resume their fight.
   The Bodo tribes have been waging a 2-year-old bush war with the
government of India's Assam state for a homeland to preserve their
ancient culture. Their campaign has left 5,000 people dead, 3,000
Bodos behind bars and more than 100,000 homeless, according to
Bharma.
   However, an Assam government official said only 513 people had
been killed since the homeland campaign turned violent in March
1987.
   ``The allegations are not only baseless, but deliberately being
spread to defame the Assam government,'' said Jyotsna Kumar Das,
the state government's chief spokesman in New Delhi.
   Bharma said the proposed 500,000-member volunteer force would be
trained with the sole aim of winning a homeland for the Bodos. ``We
will make the Assam government surrender before us,'' he said.
   He did not explicitly say the force would be armed or outline
how it would be trained. But he said: ``It will be a very powerful
force.''
   Bharma said the campaign would not lack funds. ``We collect two
rupees (12 cents) from each Bodo family every month for the cause,
and that is a lot of money.'' There about 800,000 Bodo families
making up a population of about 4 million.
   Bharma said he has agreed to meet Assam and national government
officials in February for another round of talks.
   ``If that fails, we will resume a more vigorous agitation for
which we will not be responsible.''
   The Bodo issue is one of the problems inherited by the new
government of Prime Minister V.P. Singh, who succeeded Rajiv Gandhi
six weeks ago.
   ``Assam leaders have told us that there is no way they can
accept our separate homeland demand,'' Bharma said. ``But we are
hopeful that Mr. V.P. Singh will understand our problem and will do
something.''
   The Bodos, mostly farmers of Mongol origin, have been demanding
a separate homeland in a hilly area on the northern bank of the
Brahmaputra River in Assam, which borders Bangladesh and Bhutan.
   According to Bodo leaders, 98 percent of their fellow tribesmen
practice the Bathou religion, which honors spirits believed to be
embodied in trees and rocks. They claim they suffer discrimination
by the Assamese, mostly Hindus.

   A $31 million loan to help China repair
earthquake damage is under active consideration at the World Bank _
the first since the June crackdown on pro-democracy forces,
spokesman William Brannigan said Friday.
   Brannigan said World Bank President Barber B. Conable would
decide within a week or 10 days whether to send the loan forward to
the bank's board of executive directors.
   The loan could come before that panel as early as Jan. 30 if
approved by Conable, the spokesman said.
   The bank is owned by 152 countries, with the U.S. government
holding the largest voting power _ 18 percent.
   Consideration of $780 million worth of loans to China was
suspended on June 8, four days after tanks went into Tiananmen
Square as part of a government supression of the pro-democracy
movement. Disbursements continued on loans granted earlier.
   Conable has said loans are granted only on economic grunds and
he hopes to resume lending to China soon.
   The earthquake loan is separate from those suspended in June. It
would be issued by the bank's International Development
Association, which waits 40 years for repayment and charges only
nominal interest. The United States contributes 22 percent of its
funds.
   The Oct. 18 earthquake hit northern China within a short time of
the big shock in San Francisco. The New China News Agency reported
that 29 people were killed around the border between Shanxi and
Hebei provinces and 5,000 to 8,000 houses destroyed. The area is
about 135 miles west of Beijing.
   The World Bank is the biggest source of aid to Third World
countries, lending more than $20 billion dollars a year. In the
year that ended June 30 more than $1.3 billion was approved for
China, one of its biggest borrowers.

   A judge placed the financially troubled
city of East St. Louis on one year's probation Friday for
potentially endangering its police officers by not repairing their
squad car radios.
   The city was convicted Jan. 4 of reckless conduct. That was the
city's second reckless conduct conviction in three months and only
the third known to have occurred against a city in Illinois in more
than 75 years, said St. Clair County State's Attorney John
Baricevic.
   ``The city has made a minor effort to improve the situation,''
Baricevic said. ``I do not know that everybody has a radio. I do
know that many police officers have bought their own radios.''
   The city had also been charged with reckless conduct for
allowing police cars to fall into disrepair, but was not found
guilty on that charge. Baricevic originally filed the charges
against the city in February 1988.
   Since the city could not be given a jail term, it faced a
maximum fine of $1,000 on the reckless conduct charge. Baricevic
recommended a token $1 fine because of the city's huge debt,
estimated at $40 million.
   Instead, St. Clair County Associate Judge Robert P. LeChien
placed the city on probation for one year. He said the city should
be checked regularly to ensure that it is keeping its radios and
patrol cars in good condition. The city also was assessed court and
probation costs.
   LeChien said the evidence showed there is ``pervasive potential
for danger to police officers due to faulty equipment.''
   ``I find, in aggravation, that the city has not met the
obligation of protecting its citizens,'' LeChien said.
   The city has 30 days to appeal, LeChien said. The city's
attorney, Irvin Williamson, said that was being considered.
   ``The judge went as far as he could,'' Baricevic said after the
hearing. ``The city deserves to go to jail but that is physically
... impossible.''
   Sgt. Joseph McCaskill, vice president of the city's police
union, declined to comment on the sentence until it could be
discussed with other union officers.
   Some new patrol cars have been bought but the city still fails
to keep gas in them and the tires repaired, Baricevic noted. ``But
the mayor (Carl Officer) still gets tip-top dollar for operation
for his car.''
   East St. Louis was convicted in October of reckless conduct for
a sewer system failure that flooded a high school with raw sewage.
In that case, Associate Judge C. Glenn Stevens waived the fine
because of the city's debt.
   The last known case in which a city was found guilty on a
similar charge was in 1912 when Chicago was convicted of reckless
conduct for improper operation of a municipal hospital.

   Syrian officials expelled French Nazi hunter Serge
Klarsfeld on Friday after he sought to meet with President Hafez
Assad to demand the extradition of a Nazi war criminal, Klarsfeld's
wife said.
   Beate Klarsfeld said Syrian police arrived at her husband's
hotel Friday, took him to the airport and put him on a flight to
Vienna. She said he was expected to arrive in Paris on Friday night.
   For years, the Klarsfelds have been tracking Alois Brunner,
regarded as the most wanted Nazi criminal. The Austrian-born
Brunner was once an associate of Adolf Eichmann, who headed the
Jewish section of the Gestapo.
   Brunner was sentenced to death in France in absentia in 1954 for
taking part in the deportation to death camps of more than 120,000
Jews. His extradition has also been demanded by West Germany and
Poland.
   Klarsfeld was expelled from Syria in 1982, and his wife was not
allowed to enter the country in 1986.
   He arrived in Damascus on Tuesday on a business visa granted to
him as president of the organization Sons and Daughters of Deported
Jews of France, Mrs. Klarsfeld said.
   She said her husband had tried to rent a hall in Damascus to
hold an open debate and called on the Syrian Bar Association for
help.
   The Klarsfelds' accomplishments include tracking down Klaus
Barbie, the former Gestapo chief of Lyon who was tried and
sentenced to life in prison in 1986.
   Mrs. Klarsfeld said the bar association requested official
permission to hold the debate, which she believed led to her
husband's expulsion.
   Klarsfeld was ordered to stay in his hotel room Thursday night
and was not allowed to make or receive telephone calls, but he told
his wife Friday from Vienna he was not mistreated, Mrs. Klarsfeld
said.
   Mrs. Klarsfeld said Brunner is protected by Assad's personal
bodyguards.
   She said she had no word on whether the Syrian government
responded to a letter her husband wrote to Assad.
   ``I have come to Damascus as a Jew, as a survivor of the Nazi
genocide, to seek justice in the Brunner affair,'' Klarsfeld wrote.
``The argument that (Syrian authorities) know nothing about
Brunner's presence on Syrian territory has convinced no one.''
   Mrs. Klarsfeld made a copy of the letter public Thursday in
Paris. She said it was translated into Arabic by the French Embassy
in Damascus and delivered to the presidential palace and foreign
affairs ministry by an embassy messenger. She said it was refused
at both places.
   Klarsfeld also called on Assad to improve living conditions of
Syrian Jews and to allow them to leave their homeland if they want.

<TEXT>
   A group of young anti-government
protesters on Friday broke a window of the National Assembly and
set a fire at Communist Party headquarters to protest recent price
increases.
   Calling themselves the Intercity Anarchists, the group of about
200 marched to the National Assembly, where the Senate was in
session.
   ``We have had enough of price hikes!'' and ``Soups for Kuron!''
they shouted, a reference to Labor Minister Jacek Kuron who has
established soup kitchens for the poor who are having trouble
making ends meet.
   A radical economic reform program backed by the Solidarity-led
government that went into effect Jan. 1 was accompanied by major
price increases of energy and food to try to bring down inflation.
   The Senate session was interrupted briefly when one of the
windows was broken.
   Rafal Zakrzewski, a spokesman for the Solidarity caucus in the
National Assembly, said the breaking of the window was an accident
and occurred when one of the demonstrators was pushed into the
window during a scuffle outside the building.
   The group marched to the Central Committee building of the
Communist Party, located several blocks away, and set a small fire
in front of one of the entrances.
   They then walked to the Victoria Intercontintal hotel and
shouted ``Down with capitalism!'' in front of one of the
restaurants inside the hotel.
   The demonstrators dispersed peacefully and there were no reports
of any arrests.
   In a statement issued later, Communist party spokesman Jan
Bisztyga said, ``Poland is threatened with lawlessness. After
monuments, books and buildings, the aggrression not stopped in time
will direct itself against people.''
   Bistzyga was referring to attacks on a monument to Vladimir
Ilyich Lenin, founder of the Soviet Union, in Krakow in December
when demonstrators hurled paint and set the statue afire. The
monument was removed soon thereafter.

<HEAD>HUD Raises FHA Mortgage Limit In High-Cost Areas</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Department of Housing and Urban
Development on Friday raised the ceiling on single-family mortgages
backed by its Federal Housing Administration from $101,250 to
$124,875 in a number of areas with high housing costs.
   The increase in the cap, which mostly affects communities on the
East and West Coasts, was called for in recently enacted
legislation as part of an effort by Congress to make FHA loans
available to middle- and moderate-income families in high-cost
housing areas.
   The increase will remain in effect only through Oct. 1 unless
Congress acts to extend the legislation requiring the boost. FHA
loans generally carry a more favorable interest rate than
market-rate bank mortgages and often also require a smaller down
payment than market loans.
   The standard FHA mortgage limit is $67,500; the new $124,875 is
185 percent of the standard cap _ the maximum allowed under the
legislation for high-cost areas.
   The new ceiling applies immediately to FHA loans issued for
parts of New Hampshire and all of Connecticut, Massachusetts and
Rhode Island. Also covered by the higher cap are portions of New
York and New Jersey, the Philadelphia area, Baltimore, Washington
and many of its Maryland and Virginia suburbs.
   Single-family homes in Lake County, Ill., also qualify for the
new cap, as do single-family homes in much of California. St. Croix
in the Virginia Islands also was approved for the new cap.
   Dozens of other high-cost communities nationwide were granted
increases that place the maximum FHA loans for that jurisdiction
above the old $101,250 cap but below the new maximum.

   The country's top opposition leader
said Friday he may visit North Korea to discuss reunification and
ways to ease tension on the divided peninsula.
   If Kim Dae-jung makes the visit, he would be the first South
Korean political leader to visit the Communist country since the
1950-53 Korean War.
   ``The visit will be by myself or a party delegation,'' Kim said.
   Kim, head of the largest opposition political group, the Party

government approval.
   An unauthorized visit would violate National Security Laws.
   Kim declined to elaborate on his plans and said he would
announce further details next week.
   The opposition leader said he raised the possibility of a trip
in talks with President Roh Tae-woo on Thursday and said Roh
responded favorably. There was no comment Friday from Roh's office.
   If Kim visits the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, party
officials said he would expect to contact Communist officials.
Officials of Kim's party said the visit may take place in the first
half of the year.
   Aides to Kim said the primary purpose would be to meet North
Korean President Kim Il Sung and help create a good atmosphere for
an inter-Korea summit.
   Roh has proposed a meeting with the North Korean president
several times in the past two years, but his proposal has not been
addressed specifically by the North Koreans. Two days ago, Roh told
a nationally televised news conference that he wanted to meet Kim
Il Sung to discuss possible free travel between the two nations.
   In a New Year's speech, the North Korean leader invited Roh and
South Korean opposition leaders to the North for unification talks.
Government officials said the invitation was a ploy to lump Roh and
opposition leaders in the same category, thus undermining Roh's
leadership.
   Government officials said the opposition leader's indictment on
charges related to the other lawmaker's secret trip to North Korea
would not pose a problem for his own trip.
   The 64-year-old opposition leader was indicted last summer for
allegedly failing to report to authorities the 1988 secret trip to
North Korea of one of his party's lawmakers. Kim has denied the
charge.
   Several dissident leaders are in jail for making unauthorized
trips to North Korea.
   Vice Unification Minister Song Han-ho said South Korea would
propose creating a hot line with Pyongyang so military leaders can
communicate in an emergency.
   Song also said his government plans to propose peaceful uses for
the demilitarized zone between the two countries, exchanges of
military personnel, prior notification of major military exercises
and invitations for delegates to observe such maneuvers.
   The two nations have opened several channels of talks on
personnel, economic, parliamentary and political exchanges since
the early 1970s but have made little progress.
   Reunification is a frequent demand of anti-government protesters.

   Here is an outline of Lithuania's recent history:
   _ In the 19th century, Lithuania was under the rule of the
Russian czar. Rebellions in 1831 and 1865 failed.
   _ During World War I, German troops occupied Lithuania.
   _ On Feb. 16, 1918, Lithuania declared independence from Russia
and Germany, establishing a democratic government. The Soviets
tried to take over by declaring Lithuania a Soviet republic.
Polish, German, and nationalist Lithuanian forces defeated the
Soviets and a peace treaty was signed in 1920.
   _ Poland occupied part of Lithuania, including the capital
Vilnius, from 1920 to 1939.
   _ In 1926, the democratic republic in Lithuania was overthrown
by a military coup.
   _ In September 1939, dividing Europe in a secret protocol
accompanying their non-aggression pact, Adolf Hitler and Josef
Stalin assigned Lithuania to the Soviet sphere of influence.
   _ In 1940, the Soviets occupied Lithuania, proclaimed
establishment of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic and
forcibly annexed it to the U.S.S.R.
   _ The Germans again occupied Lithuania when they invaded Russia
in 1941, but the Soviets returned in 1944 when the Germans
retreated.
   _ From 1944 to 1952, thousands of Lithuanian guerrillas died
fighting Soviet rule. About 350,000 Lithuanians were banished to
Siberian labor camps.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Prosecutors Seek Noriega Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran-Contra prosecutors have expressed an
interest in documents seized from the headquarters of fallen
Panamanian dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega, the Justice Department
said Friday.
   The office of independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh inquired
Thursday about the documents that were found in Noriega's
headquarters following last month's invasion, said Justice
Department spokesman David Runkel.
   Runkel said Attorney General Dick Thornburgh had directed the
Justice Department's criminal division to cooperate with Walsh's
requests for access to the documents.
   ``We will cooperate with them in providing whatever access they
would like,'' Runkel said. The spokesman did not provide specific
details of Walsh's request.
   Mary Belcher, a spokeswoman for the independent counsel also
declined comment on the nature of the request.
   But Walsh presumably wants to see documents showing Noriega's
dealings in the Iran-Contra affair, particularly with former White
House aide Oliver L. North and John M. Poindexter, who was national
security adviser under President Reagan.
   Poindexter is awaiting trial on charges of lying to Congress
about secret U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Walsh's interest would relate to Noriega's assistance to the
Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, at a time when U.S. aid was
banned by Congress.
   Noriega, now awaiting trial in Miami on cocaine trafficking
charges, once offered to assassinate Sandinista leaders, according
to an uncontested statement, known as a stipulation, filed during
North's Iran-Contra trial last year. Poindexter and North spurned
the offer, but the national security adviser expressed an interest
in Noriega directing sabotage against Nicaraguan facilities, the
stipulation said.
   The documents seized at the Panamanian Defense Forces
headquarters might shed light on Panamanian-based companies used to
funnel covert U.S. assistance to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   A team of a dozen Justice Department attorneys and investigators
are combing through the documents to determine if they contain
evidence of violations of federal law by Noriega or others.
   Some of the material has already been brought to this country
for further review by prosecutors, Runkel said.
   The stipulation agreed to by the government and filed at North's
trial outlines some assistance Noriega gave the Contras. It says
Noriega helped the Contras destroy a Sandinista arsenal in 1985.
   It also states that in 1986 a Noriega representative told North
that Panamanians would assassinate Sandinista leaders in return for
a U.S. promise to improve Panama's image and lift a ban on military
sales.
   North, according to the court statement, responded that U.S. law
barred assassinations and Noriega's representative said the general
``had numerous assets in place in Nicaragua and could accomplish
many essential things.''
   North reported the conversation to Poindexter, who responded
that ``if Noriega had assets inside Nicaragua, he could be
helpful.''
   While assassination was illegal, Poindexter said ``sabotage
would be another story,'' the document said. ``Poindexter
recommended that North speak with Noriega.''
   North met with Noriega in September 1986 in London, where
Noriega offered to take action against the Sandinistas, the
document said.
   The document stated that Noriega offered a list of possible
sabotage targets, including an oil refinery, an airport and an
off-loading facility.
   Jose I. Blandon, a former Noriega confidante who defected in
1988, told a Senate subcommittee that the Panamanian leader and
North met in June 1985 on a boat anchored off Panama City to
discuss what Noriega could do to help the Contras.
   Blandon, who is expected to testify at Noriega's drug
trafficking trial in Miami, said his former boss agreed to help
train the Contras and allow the rebel leaders safe passage in and
out of Panama.

<HEAD>Fundamentalists Say Syrian Faction Blocking Attack on Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pro-Iranian fundamentalist group
claimed Friday it is under siege by a Syrian-backed militia because
that force wants to prevent it from attacking Israeli occupiers.
   An estimated 10,000 backers of the fundamentalist Hezbollah
demonstrated in south Beirut's suburb of Bir el-Abed to protest
what they called the Amal militia's siege on the fundamentalists in
southern Iqlim al-Tuffah province.
   The protesters, including women in black chadors, also chanted
slogans against the United States, France and Israel.
   ``What is happening today in Iqlim al-Tuffah is a big conspiracy
aiming at totally terminating the Islamic resistance and making us
pay the price for confronting the Israeli occupying force in the
region,'' said a Hezbollah statement distributed to reporters at
the demonstration.
   Amal had no comment on the charges by Hezbollah.
   The secular Amal militia and the Hezbollah are vying for control
of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiite Moslems. They have been fighting
each other since Dec. 23 in Iqlim al-Tuffah.
   By police count, more than 97 people have been killed and 277
wounded in the current round of fighting.
   Police reported Friday intermittent clashes with
rocket-propelled grenades and machine gun fire with no casualties
reported.
   But Tehran radio, monitored in Cyprus, reported that an Iranian
delegation in Lebanon trying to mediate a peace accord released a
statement saying ``presently, a cease-fire is being completely
respected by both sides.''
   ``Both sides have expressed a readiness to withdraw their
fighters to pre-conflict borders,'' the statement said. It
predicted such a withdrawal was imminent.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is the largest group in the Islamic
resistance, a coalition of extremist Moslem factions fighting
Israeli troops in the self-declared Israeli ``security zone'' in
the south.
   Israel carved the security zone up to 10 miles deep into Lebanon
in June 1985, when it withdrew most of its invasion army from
Lebanon after a three-year occupation.
   The zone, jointly patrolled by 1,500 Israeli troops and about
2,500 allied militiamen, serves as a buffer against cross-border
guerrilla infiltrations into northern Israeli settlements.
   ``Amal has launched the war in Iqlim al-Tuffah, imposed a siege
on our mujahedeen (fighters) who confront the Israeli enemy,
despite the cold, and has blocked their supply routes,'' the
Hezbollah statement charged.
   It urged Lebanese leaders to work on ending Amal's attacks and
to pressure the secular faction into opening roads so Hezbollah can
continue ``liberating all Israeli-occupied territories.''

<TEXT>
   The police dispatcher hailed as a hero when the
Charles Stuart case broke testified Friday before a grand jury
looking into evidence implicating Stuart in his pregnant wife's
shooting death.
   Gary McLaughlin refused to discuss what he said or even how long
his appearance lasted. He did say that since Charles Stuart's
suicide last week, he had reviewed the transcript of the Oct. 23
call.
   When asked if he found anything suspicious, he said ``not
really,'' but he wouldn't elaborate. McLaughlin added ``on a
personal level, I think the country was duped.''
   ``It's a bizarre and twisted case,'' he said.
   Carol Stuart, 30, who was seven months pregnant, died hours
after the shooting, and her premature baby, Christopher, died 17
days later. Until Stuart's Jan. 4 suicide, most people believed
Stuart's account that he and his wife were victims of a mugger.
   The case drew attention because of a dramatic conversation
between McLaughlin and the wounded Stuart, using his car telephone,
to eventually direct police to him and his wife.
   Investigators learned of the hoax when a younger brother,
Matthew Stuart, told authorities Jan. 3 that he met Charles at the
murder scene and retrieved Mrs. Stuart's handbag, which contained a
gun and some personal items.
   Matthew Stuart, 23, said he was not aware Mrs. Stuart was shot
when his brother passed him the bag, but prosecutors declined to
say whether he or anyone else might face charges.
   Suffolk County District Attorney Newman Flanagan said this week
that no one was granted immunity to testify before the grand jury,
which was hearing evidence off and on since shortly after the
shooting occurred.
   District attorney spokesman John Julian declined to say how many
witnesses would be called, and he said the panel could conclude
that no one _ other than Charles Stuart _ committed any crime.
   ``We're just trying to get at the true story,'' he said.
   While the Stuarts were described as a loving couple by many of
their friends and relatives, reports have surfaced that Charles
Stuart was unhappy with his wife's pregnancy and believed a baby
would interfere with his ambitions.
   Also, statements by attorneys indicate that Stuart not only
enlisted the help of his brother, Matthew, in the scheme, but also
made overtures to another brother, Michael, weeks before the crime.
   A critical piece of evidence, the .38-caliber revolver believed
to be the murder weapon, was recovered this week from the Pines
River in Revere, where Matthew Stuart said the gun was thrown.
   Authorities were waiting for test results to confirm whether the
gun was used in the shooting.

   The San Francisco Main Library reopened for
the first time in nearly four months Friday, only partially healed
from the devastating Oct. 17 earthquake that sent tens of thousands
of books crashing from shelves.
   A driving rain pushed the gala ceremony inside, but about 300
book-lovers attended anyway.
   ``Delighted to be here,'' said a beaming Mayor Art Agnos as he
cut a ribbon officially reopening the ornate, 73-year-old building.
An accordion combo squeezed out music and the crowd of adults and
school children applauded, then stampeded up to the book-crammed
second floor.
   Still closed, however, is the heavily damaged north wing, where
many of the 900,000 volumes crashed to the floor from sheared
stacks during last autumn's quake. The wing housed all of the
circulating books for the history and science departments.
   ``The earthquake didn't discriminate that day _ children's books
fell alongside history books; the science-fiction books fell
together with the repair-manuals ... and everything in between,''
the mayor said.
   Agnos on Friday became the first person to check out books _
politically correct choices including one on the San Francisco
49ers, another on the Giants and a thick tome on classical Greeks.
   Librarians, pages and volunteers were still filling the
circulating collection stacks at midweek.
   ``Exactly how many circulating books were lost in the shaker was
not known,'' said circulating librarian Glenda Goldwater.
   ``We won't know until we generate overdue notices,'' she said,
adding that no fines will be imposed until Feb. 1.
   The quake that struck Northern California last October measured
7.1 on the Richter scale, killed 67 people and caused about $7
billion in damage.

<HEAD>McMartin Judge Wants to Unseal Verdicts, But Attorneys Refuse</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in the McMartin Pre-School
molestation trial said he wants to unseal 52 verdicts to avoid a
mistrial, but attorneys insisted that none be unsealed until all 65
verdicts are rendered.
   Superior Court Judge William Pounders abruptly canceled a
hearing scheduled for Friday to confront the question of reading
partial verdicts after defense and prosecution lawyers telephoned
him to express adamant opposition to a piecemeal return of verdicts.
   The panelists are considering 65 charges, including child
molestation and conspiracy, in the case of Raymond Buckey, 31, and
his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63. They are accused of abusing
11 children at their now-defunct McMartin Pre-School in suburban
Manhattan Beach.
   The 2{-year-old McMartin trial is the longest and costliest
criminal proceeding in U.S. history. With no alternates left to
replace any ailing juror, the absence of even one jury member would
cause a mistrial.
   ``My feeling is I want to take those verdicts,'' Pounders said
Thursday after the panel returned 13 more decisions, bringing their
total to 52. ``But that's not necessarily the right decision. If
the attorneys are unanimously against it, that could end it.''
   The jurors ``are making great progress,'' he said. ``We have
over 78 percent of the verdicts in. But if I lose one juror I lose
all 52 verdicts, which is why I'm on the razor's edge.''
   None of the verdicts is final until jurors affirm in open court
that each was their decision.
   ``My position is what it has always been _ leave the jury
alone,'' said attorney Dean Gits, who represents Mrs. Buckey.
``Unsealing verdicts now will only put undue pressure on them. We
have no indication they are deadlocked, and until we do let's leave
them alone.''
   Sandi Gibbons, spokesperson for District Attorney Ira Reiner,
said prosecutors opposed Pounders' plan as well.
   ``The position of this office has always been that we oppose
reading partial verdicts,'' she said.
   Pounders said he decided to await further word from the jury.
Jurors deliberated only a half day Friday because one of them had a
doctor's appointment, and they chose to take the day off Monday
because of Martin Luther King's birthday, a court holiday.
   Shortly after the jurors resumed their talks Friday, the judge
warned them not to watch Monday night's scheduled ABC-TV show about
child molestation called ``Unspeakable Acts.''

   College students here are getting a
promise of value for their vittles and if they don't like cafeteria
food they won't have to lump it.
   Under a beefed-up food plan, if students at Clark University
aren't satisfied with their meals, they'll get their money back,
school officials say.
   ``Students today want value for their dollar, and this just puts
a little more commitment, a little more muscle, behind our vow of
the highest quality,'' said Jack Foley, the school's business
manager.
   For some students, however, the new plan _ which includes a
bigger selection of meals _ may be too little too late.
   ``I've been eating that food for almost four years. You want to
see sad, you should take a look at it,'' said Dorothy Wohl, a
senior from New York.
   Asked to characterize the food, she said ```mediocre' is a
kindness.''
   The money-back guarantee, which goes into effect when Clark
students return from their winter break on Monday, was made
possible by the opening of a new dining center on campus, Foley
said.
   Clark students, previously served by more traditional
institutional fare, will now be able to get their meals from a wok,
griddle, stove, pizza oven or salad bar, he said.
   Foley said the school was expecting to return some money to
dissatisfied students. Breakfast costs $1.66, lunch or brunch costs
$3.32, and the price of dinner is $4.99. Costs of the refunds will
be borne jointly by the school and Daka Inc., its food services
contractor, he said.

   The maid made out when a judge ruled ``finders
keepers'' on a $30,000 stash of $100 bills she found stuffed behind
a dresser in hotel room.
   The verdict in Fulton County Superior Court on Thursday ended a
6{-year battle over the fistfuls of bills that Diana M.
Merriweather discovered in a room at the Tower Place Hotel in 1983.
   ``I guess I'm a bit surprised,'' Ms. Merriweather said. She said
she hopes to open a small business with the money.
   But a jeweler who contended the money was his said he was even
more surprised.
   William Mackley, 41, of Paris, Texas, said the verdict was
``unbelievable'' and that he would appeal.
   He said he and an associate, Casey Strickland, who couldn't be
located for the trial, each thought the other had used the money to
buy antique jewelry.
   The room was registered to Strickland, and jurors were told that
when he was reached by telephone after several weeks had passed, he
denied having left anything behind.
   Hotel attorney Robert D. Wildstein told jurors that Mackley said
the bills were crisp and new when they were actually old, and he
misidentified the color of the wrappers.
   Judge Leah Sears-Collins ordered the court to hold the money
pending an appeal.

<TEXT>
   A comatose woman who had an abortion after
her husband battled abortion opponents is recovering well through
rehabilitation that would have been impossible if she remained
pregnant, her doctor said Friday.
   Nancy Klein's recovery has been spurred by her determination to
get home to her husband, Martin, and their 4-year-old daughter,
Arielle.
   ``She likes seeing Arielle. That really perks her up,'' said her
physician, Caroline O. McCagg, who described Mrs. Klein's therapy
as a ``boot camp'' regimen from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily.
   Mrs. Klein, 33, doesn't remember the Dec. 13, 1988, car
collision that put her in a coma when she was 18 weeks pregnant.
But she is remembering some things day-to-day and from before the
accident, and she has learned to speak, feed herself and use a
wheelchair to get around the Robert Wood Johnson Jr. Rehabilitation
Institute about 20 miles southwest of New York City.
   Doctors initially believed her recovery prospects were slim, but
told her husband that chances would improve slightly if she had an
abortion. Doctors performed the operation 11 months ago after Klein
fought abortion foes all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``We are all very pleased about Nancy's recovery to date and we
remain hopeful that she'll continue to recover as well in the
future,'' Klein said in a telephone interview from his New York
home. ``We just want people to know that this is one step in a very
long road ahead.''
   ``We think its a miracle,'' said Nancy's mother, Anne Zusselman,
in a telephone interview from another daughter's home in New Jersey.
   ``Nancy has been working so hard at therapy,'' said Mrs.
Zusselman of Delray Beach, Fla. ``She goes slowly but doesn't stop,
doesn't plateau.''
   Mrs. Zusselman said her daughter has made two weekend visits to
her Upper Brookville home on New York's Long Island and has gone on
day visits to her sister's home in New Jersey.
   McCagg, medical director of the institute's Center for Head
Injuries, said Mrs. Klein is able to make it through the tough
therapeutic program when hospital workers tell her, ``This is going
to get you home.''
   McCagg said the pregnancy would have blocked the use of
antibiotics and antiseizure medicines necessary for Mrs. Klein's
recovery.
   John Short, one of the activists who tried to stop the abortion,
said from his Farmingdale, N.Y., home, ``Naturally, I'm happy for
Nancy Klein. I just feel sad the child won't be there to help her
in her recovery.''
   ``I hope she doesn't have to go through the trauma of asking,
`Where is my child,' and having to be told it was killed,'' he said.
   Mrs. Klein was admitted to the institute in March. Her eyes were
open, but she could not communicate. She began answering yes-and-no
questions by pressing a button early last summer. Three months ago
she began using a wheelchair and began talking as long as two
months ago, said McCagg.
   The doctor said complete recovery is unusual in cases involving
such severe head injuries, but added that Mrs. Klein will be able
to become pregnant again and is expected to remain in the hospital
for at least six more months.

   The city of Miami is having fun playing host to
deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega. Noriega humor abounds
on radio stations, and Noriega T-shirts are big sellers.
   T-shirts emblazoned with ``Miami, see it like a dictator'' show
Noriega behind bars. The shirts lampoon the tourism slogan ``Miami,
see it like a native.''
   At the Southern Auto Outlet, a 40-foot wide electric sign
flashes ``Now Manuel, Next Fidel,'' and then ``Welcome to Miami,
Manny.''
   Radio station WHYI-Y100 has been giving away ``Noriega Packs'' _
brown shopping bags containing an acne cream, red underwear, voodoo
trinkets, a one-way bus ticket to Homestead and a pineapple.
   Critics have called Noriega ``pineapple face'' because of his
acne scars, aides said he wore red underwear to ward off evil
spirits, and trinkets were found at his Panamanian headquarters.
Noriega landed at Homestead Air Force Base when he was flown to
Florida on Jan. 4 to face drug trafficking charges.
   The station asked its listeners one morning after Noriega's
arrival, ``Did you hear the one about the new car?''
   ``It's called the Noriega. It comes in Manuel and
semiautomatic.''
   Spanish-language radio station WQBA-FM conducted an
``exclusive'' interview with the ousted leader.
   ``General, how do you feel within the four walls of your cell?''
asked music director Alberto Rodriguez.
   Noriega responds in the romantic voice of Miami resident Julio
Iglesias: ``I'm a lonely man, so very lonely.''
   Noriega's prison number proved unlucky for the 12,139 people who
played 4-1-5-6-8 in Florida's Fantasy 5 lottery game last Friday.
That was the day The Miami Herald put Noriega's mug shot on the
front page with his booking number underneath.
   The number was the highest-played Fantasy 5 number in the
history of the game, said lottery spokesman Ed George. But if those
numbers had been picked, the winners would have split small change.

   A district council on Friday
unveiled plans to build a $133 million amusement park four miles
east of Belfast.
   Castlereagh District Council has chosen an 85-acre site at
Dundonald for the park, whose centerpiece will be a huge glass dome
covering a temperature-controlled boating lake.
   The park will be built next to the Dundonald International Ice
Bowl, a skating rink opened four years ago by the council.
   Construction on the project is to begin this year, and the
project is expected to create 2,000 permanent jobs and 1,500 more
during building.
   The project will include a waterfall, rides, a hotel,
self-catering facilities, conference center, nine-hole golf course,
equestrian center, multiscreen cinema, a museum and craft center.
   Ice Bowl Chairman Peter Robinson, a member of the council, said
negotiations for European Community and private-sector funding were
at an advanced stage.

   President Bush warned Congress on Friday not
to look for big savings from Pentagon spending and complained that
his key domestic initiatives were mired ``in the jungles on Capitol
Hill.''
   While applauding the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe, Bush
cautioned against expectations of any ``peace dividend'' in the
military budget, saying that is ``not money in the bank. It is more
like a possible future inheritance.''
   Meanwhile, he said, ``It's impossible today to know what will
unfold in the next six months, let alone the next six years.''
   Bush said the U.S. invasion of Panama was proof that America
must have a ``ready and highly effective defense force.''
   The president spoke to about 1,500 people at a gathering of the
Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce.
   Later, he met privately with the family of Army Pfc. James
Markwell, a Ranger medic killed by gunfire in his drop zone in the
Panama invasion.
   The White House said Bush expressed his personal sympathy and
gratitude for the sacrifice that Markwell made for his country.
   Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, speaking with reporters later,
said the president's talk with the family of the dead soldier was
``a pretty emotional meeting.''
   Fitzwater said that ``we were all pretty broken up about it,''
referring to the president, as well as several aides and Secret
Service agents.
   Fitzwater said that the soldier's mother, Mrs. William Rouse,
showed the president a poem that her son had written when he was 15
years old about being in the military, as well as a ``death
message'' that he had written before going into combat.
   Fitzwater said that in that message her son ``was proud of what
he was doing. It was a little message for each of the people he
knew in life.''
   ``That was really tough,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush also has sent letters of condolence to the families of all
those killed in Panama, officials said.
   The president's combative stand toward Congress sets the tone
for legislative battles likely to erupt after lawmakers return to
work Jan. 23. Bush will send his budget to Congress on Jan. 29 and
deliver his State of the Union Address on Jan. 30.
   He said the Democratic-controlled Congress had stalled action on
his plans to lower capital gains taxes, beef up education programs,
strengthen clean-air regulations and fight crime.
   ``And these four issues are bogged down in the jungles on
Capitol Hill,'' Bush said.
   ``The clock is running and America's patience is running out,''
Bush said.
   While saying he was not trying to assign any blame, Bush said,
``America wants it done right, America wants it done responsibly
and America wants it done now.''
   The fall of hardline communist governments in Eastern Europe has
prompted calls in Congress and elsewhere for lowering defense
spending and targeting the money for other purposes.
   ``That's like the next-of-kin who spend the inheritance before
the will is read,'' Bush said.
   ``Of course, whenever a potential inheritance looms,'' he said,
``there are those eager to rush out and squander it, to buy new
things, to spend, to spend, to spend _ spending funds they don't
yet have.
   ``Then the bills start coming, and the inheritance may not,''
Bush said. ``And what was promised as a bonus becomes a burden.''
   He won applause by saying, ``most Americans know we not only
must maintain our defenses but still must reduce the deficit.''
   Bush also paid a visit to predominantly black Taft High School,
where he hailed a program of business leaders, government officials
and educators to reduce dropouts and improve academic performance.
   Several speakers told Bush there was a sense of hopelessness
among inner-city youths and asked what he could do about it.
   He said the best answer was ``encouraging the strength of the
family.''
   Bush said federal resources for education were limited but that
he would call for some increases in overall school spending when he
presents his fiscal 1991 budget to Congress on Jan. 23, including
expanding the Head Start program for disadvantaged pre-school
children.
   But, the president added, ``I don't think you can design a
curriculum to lift the self-esteem of a kid. It's got to come from
peers, it's got to come from family, it's got to come from
dedicated volunteers or workers who are saying, `Hey, you are
somebody. You can amount to something.''

<TEXT>
   A prison inmate sued Meridian and state
officials for erroneously diagnosing him as an AIDS virus carrier
after he bit a police officer.
   In a complaint filed this week in U.S. District Court at
Meridian, Lavarn Bounds, an inmate at the Mississippi State
Penitentiary at Parchman, named the Lauderdale County Health
Department and the Police Department as defendants.
   Bounds is seeking damages for defamation and slander, and
violations of his privacy and constitutional rights. He is seeking
$250,000 from the health department and $150,000 from the police
department.
   Bounds was arrested in January 1989 and charged with simple
assault on a police officer as a result of a struggle with
Patrolman Dan Mahla, during which the officer was bitten on the leg.
   Police said they had been pursuing Bounds in a drug
investigation.
   During a subsequent interview from his Lauderdale County Jail
cell, Bounds told a reporter he had received, from someone from the
health department, the results of tests that had been conducted
about three weeks earlier when he sought medical help.
   Bounds said the man confirmed he carried the acquired immune
deficiency syndrome antibody.
   Bounds also claims in his complaint that he was tested for AIDS
on July 21, 1989, at the state Department of Corrections' Rankin
County facility, and again when he arrived at the state
penitentiary, and that the results were negative.
   ``All we can go by is what was told to us'' by health officials
on the original test results, Police Chief Steve Thomas said Friday.
   Thomas said he hadn't seen the lawsuit and couldn't comment
further.
   He said Mahla underwent AIDS tests after the biting incident,
and wasn't found to be a carrier of the disease.
   ``On AIDS tests there's always a slim chance of some kind of
false positive. It's a slim chance, but there is a chance _ any
doctor will tell you that,'' state Health Department spokeswoman
Terri Sasser said Friday.

   The December freeze killed a bald eagle
found near a nest in a wildlife reserve, officials said Friday.
   ``A survey by a volunteer helicopter pilot of 10 eagle nests
this week indicated that no fledglings were killed as a result of
the freeze,'' said Virginia Van Sickle, secretary of the Department
of Wildlife and Fisheries.
   During the record Dec. 17-25 freeze, temperatures dropped as low
as 4 degrees in Louisiana. The dead eagle was found right after the
freeze, in the Salvador Wildlife Management Area near New Orleans,
Van Sickle said.
   Normally, eagles nest and produce young in December and January
``so the department was concerned about their survival status,''
Van Sickle said. ``Apparently the weather had little effect on the
overall eagle population.''
   Louisiana has 45 nesting pairs with some offspring.

<HEAD>Snow In East, Rain Welcomed In Northern California</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow was scattered around the Great Lakes and along the
Appalachians from the Southeast into New England on Friday, and a
new storm loaded with snow and rain rolled onto the West Coast in
northern California.
   The rain was welcome in northern California, where officials
have been fearing drought.
   East Bay Municipal Utility District spokesman Gayle Montgomery
said the Alameda-Contra Costa water district's reservoirs have
about 61 percent of their storage capacity and only about 10 to 12
inches of snow in the Sierra Nevada. The district got about 12
percent of its annual rainfall in November but didn't have any rain
in December, which usually accounts for 16 percent, he said.
   In January, the district counts on getting about 18 percent of
its yearly rainfall and he called Friday's storm ``the first
encouraging thing we've seen in a long time.''
   A winter storm watch was posted for Saturday and Saturday night
over northwestern Nevada.
   A series of small storm systems were expected to be followed
closely by more wet weatherfronts early next week.
   During the day, snow fell from northeastern Minnesota across
northern Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, north-central and
northeastern Tennessee, northwestern North Carolina, western
Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, western Pennsylvania, New York
state, central New England and northern New England.
   Gusty wind and snow flurries caused at least three trucks to
jackknife on icy Michigan roads. Icy roads and poor visibility
closed schools in northwestern Lower Michigan.
   A heavy snow warning was posted into Saturday over northwestern
Pennsylvania, where 8 to 16 inches of snow was possible by morning.
   From Thursday night into Friday, up to 4 inches of snow fell
over parts of Ohio.
   Morning snow squalls produced as much as 2 inches of snow across
north-central West Virginia and the state's northern mountains.
   Friday's low for the Lower 48 states was zero degrees at
Gunnison, Colo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 7
degrees at Warroad, Minn., to 78 at Miami.

   Air pollution data from scores of industrial
plants show high levels of cancer-causing chemicals still are being
released, raising health concerns for those living nearby, the
Environmental Protection Agency said.
   The agency cautioned that the toxic releases should not be
considered a clear measure of an individual's lifetime risk of
getting cancer because the analysis reflects a worst-case situation.
   ``Nevertheless, the estimates for some of the facilities on the
list continue to be of serious concern,'' EPA Administrator William
Reilly said in a letter to Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., whose
office made public the data.
   EPA spokesman David Cohen said Friday auditors have been sent to
a number of plants for close examination of high toxic release
levels.
   The statistics covered toxic chemical releases into the air at
149 operating industrial plants, pulp mills and other facilities in
34 states.
   The findings showed toxic release levels at 52 plants were high
enough that persons living closest to the plant could be exposed to
a lifetime cancer risk of at least 1 in 1,000. The potential risk
was as great as 1 in 10 at the Texaco butadiene plant in Port
Neches, Texas, and 1 in 100 at 6 other plants. The EPA said the
risk was 1 in 10,000 at 97 other plants.
   The government in many cases considers a maximum cancer risk of
1 in 1 million to be unacceptable.
   Chemical industry spokesmen acknowleged that at some plants too
many toxic chemcials are being released but said the latest figures
``confirm ... that the trend of air emission releases from chemical
plants is heading down.''
   ``We are convinced that releases of emissions from chemical
plants are not harmful to residents nearby,'' said the Chemical
Manufacturers Association, an industry trade group, in a statement
responding to the EPA figures.
   The EPA cautioned the cancer risk assessments were in many cases
based on mathematical models and were not intended to reflect the
actual cancer risk to particular individuals. In the risk
assessment, for example, it is presumed a person resides about 200
feet from the source of the release and is exposed over a lifetime.
   ``The data should raise a red warning flag in communities where
these facilities are located and spur prompt action to investigate
the plants further,'' said Waxman. ``It shows that a great number
of plants potentially pose extremely high cancer risks to the
public.''
   Waxman said the data confirms preliminary findings made
available by the EPA last May. Those findings were criticized by
industry after it was found that some of the data had been up to
six years old and included some plants that were no longer
operating.
   The disclosure prompted the EPA to review toxic releases at the
plants and led to the development of the latest figures which the
agency said reflects releases in 1988 or 1989.
   Reilly in his letter to Waxman said the agency was taking ``very
seriously the potential problems these emissions could present''
and that the EPA was working with corporate executives to reduce
the toxic emissions at some of the plants.
   ``I also intend to examine options available to realize other
emission reductions as soon as possible, including use of existing
enforcement authorities to reduce risks associated with toxic air
emissions,'' continued Reilly. He did not elaborate on the
enforcement action.
   In addition to the Texaco Chemical Co., plant in Port Neches,
the facilities where toxic releases posed the highest potential
cancer risk _ all a risk of 1 in 100 _ were: an Asarco Inc., lead
smelting plant in East Helena, Mont.; a Mobil Chemical Co., plant
in Beaumont, Texas; a Shell Oil Co., plant in Deer Park, Texas; a
Uniroyal rubber processing plant in Port Neches, Texas; a Goodyear
plant in Calhoun, Ga.; and an American Chrome chemical plant in
Corpus Christi, Texas.

   Interim President Ion Iliescu told
thousands of anti-Communist demonstrators Friday that Romania's
Communist Party has been outlawed.
   ``Victory, Victory!'' shouted the crowd of 5,000 after Iliescu's
announcement. ``The Front is with us!'' they yelled, referring to
the National Salvation Front, the country's interim leadership.
   Iliescu's announcement was broadcast live on state radio and
television.
   The announcement came hours after the crowd had shouted down
Iliescu and other leaders who tried to speak. Demonstrators yelled
``Down with Communism! Kill the Communists!'' They burned a
Romanian Communist flag and Communist identification papers.
   Friday was a national day of mourning, with religious ceremonies
held across the country in memory of the victims of the violent
revolution that toppled Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu three
weeks ago.
   Iliescu, himself a former Communist, made the announcement from
the window of the building where the interim government has its
headquarters on the Victoria Square.
   ``The Romanian Communist Party is outlawed, considering that it
is against the national spirit and our ancestor's law,'' he said.
   Iliescu however did not say what the decision would mean for
current members of the party. Much of Romania's new leadership is
composed of Communists.
   Before the Communists took power in 1948, Romania was ruled by a
constitutional monarchy.
   Romania's newly appointed General Prosecutor Gheorghe Robu told
Romanian TV Friday all leading members of the Romanian Communist
Party were under arrest and their role in the Ceausescu regime was
under investigation. He said the trials would begin within 10 days.
   He said Ceausescu's children and brothers, who were arrested in
the first days of the revolt, would be brought to trial soon.
   Iliescu also told the crowd that a national referendum would be
held Jan. 28 on whether the death sentence should be reinstated for
members of Ceausescu's hated security police.
   The feared Securitate continued to battle the army even after
Ceausescu was overthrown Dec. 22 by popular revolt.
   Ceausescu was executed with his wife Elena, considered No. 2 in
the party, on Dec. 25. The Front then abolished the death penalty
and said members of the security forces convicted by military
tribunals would be sentenced to lengthy prison terms.
   ``Death to the Securitate'' and ``Death for Death'' the crowd
chanted, referring to the estimated 10,000 who died in the clashes
between security forces and the army during the revolution.
   Iliescu said the referendum on the death penalty was necessary
``for the adequate punishment of those guilty of crimes against the
people.''
   Earlier in an effort to appease the crowd, Iliescu said security
officials would be tried and sentenced ``according to the laws.''
He said the trials would be public and even shown on television.
   The daily Romania Libera carried an appeal Friday from Communist
Party members calling on ``all the honest members'' to burn their
party cards ``at places where martyrs of the revolution died, as a
public condemnation of any idea of recreating a new Communist
Party.''
   Iliescu was repeatedly confronted by angry people in the crowd
who grabbed the microphone to question him.
   ``Do you agree with me that the Front should represent all the
parties and that they should all have at least three members,''
asked painter Augustin Pora, who said he was a leader of an
anti-Communist alliance.
   ``I agree, I agree,'' Iliescu responded. ``The front is the
representative of all the democratic forces in the country,'' he
said at another point.
   An unidentified woman screamed into the microphone, ``Who is Mr.
Iliescu and what has he been doing in the last five years?''
   ``I have been head of the National Council for water,'' Iliescu
said. I am the son of a worker. I have been in prison. In 1971 I
was fired from the leadership of the party. I have spoken out
against Communism.''
   Iliescu was demoted after criticizing Ceausescu's autocratic
rule.
   Friday's demonstration was the largest anti-Communist protest
since Ceausescu was ousted. Under his iron-fisted 24-year rule, any
form of protest or criticism of the leadership or Communist Party
was nipped in the bud.
   The Front comprises former Communist Party members, former
dissidents and intellectuals. It says its main purpose is to lead
the country until the elections, promised as early as April.
   Premier Petre Roman, addressing the crowd Friday, said ``it is
still a question if the ... Front will participate in the
elections.''
   Iliescu declared Friday the day of national mourning for ``all
those who gave their lives in the fight against the dictatorial
regime.'' However, most stores remained open.
   Iliescu and other leaders went out to speak with the protesters
after attending a solemn service at the Patriarhie Orthodox
Cathedral in downtown Bucharest for the victims.
   The service was conducted by Patriarch Teoctist, spiritual
leader of the Romanian Orthodox Church. Under Ceausescu, religious
practices were greatly suppressed.

   Azerbaijanis blockaded government offices and
seized a radio station in a Caspian Sea port, and Georgians
demanding independence drove bureaucrats from their offices in the
Caucasus, according to reports Friday.
   The new ethnic turmoil coincided with a visit to Lithuania by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who is trying to counter an
independence drive in that Baltic republic and has been warning of
ethnic conflicts.
   The protesters in the Azerbaijani city of Lenkoran vented their
anger over an Armenian parliamentary measure that implied
possession of the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, said
Savili Peretz, deputy director of the republic's official news
agency Azerinform.
   He said the protest took place Thursday and the Lenkoran area
remained tense Friday.
   Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous enclave claimed by Armenia and
Azerbaijan, has been in a state of civil war for two years, with
bombings, strikes, sniper fire and hostage-taking. It is the most
intractable ethnic conflict in the country and has killed more than
200 people.
   The official news agency Tass said Friday that Lt. I. Tsymbalyuk
of the Interior Ministry, which is trying to keep order in
Nagorno-Karabakh, was killed Thursday in the Azerbaijani-populated
village of Akhullu. It said a preliminary investigation found that
an Azerbaijani policemen fired the shot.
   The Communist Party chief and several other officials were taken
hostage in the Shaumian district of the republic, bordering
Nagorno-Karabakh, the news service Interfax, a branch of Radio
Moscow, reported. It said all those seized are ethnic Armenians.
   On Friday, Azerbaijanis wearing bulletproof vests and carrying
machine guns attacked Manashid village in the district, Tass
reported. It said there were casualties, but gave no details.
   In Georgia, protesters demanding independence for the southern
republic drove government workers from their offices in Kareli, a
small town 50 miles northwest of the capital, Tbilisi, on Thursday,
activist Irina Sarishvili reported. She said protesters occupied
the town and regional government offices of the area on the banks
of the Kura River.
   ``Soviet power has ceased to function,'' said Sarishvili, a
leader of the pro-independence National Democratic Party of
Georgia, speaking by telephone from Tbilisi.
   A deputy director of Georgia's official news agency, Gruzinform,
Otar Kapanadze, said he had no information about disturbances in
Kareli.
   Tbilisi has been the scene of rallies for days by protesters
demanding that a Politburo member from Moscow come to negotiate
granting the republic independence.
   Troops wielding shovels and clubs attacked a similar
pro-independence rally in Tbilisi in April, killing 19 people. A
20th was killed later.
   Sarishvili said many businesses and most forms of mass transit
were on strike in Tbilisi in support of independence.
   Kapanadze said transit was interrupted only in the morning,
because demonstrators blocked roads. He said some businesses closed
not because of a strike, but because low water levels at
hydroelectric stations caused an electricity shortage.
   The government newspaper Izvestia said Friday that in Lenkoran
``power has fully gone over into the hands of the representatives
of the People's Front,'' a grassroots political group in
Azerbaijan. It said protesters blocked government and party
workers, military officers and police from going to work and formed
their own ``temporary defense committee'' to keep order.
   Peretz said hundreds of people took over the Lenkoran radio
station to broadcast their opinions about the Armenian
parliamentary action.
   No one was hurt and the protest ended peacefully after a few
hours with no arrests, he reported.
   The protesters objected to a measure approved by the Armenian
parliament Tuesday incorporating an economic and social development
plan for Nagorno-Karabakh into that of the Armenian republic,
Peretz said.
   The measure also brought censure from Gorbachev and other Soviet
leaders Wednesday. They condemned it, along with an Azerbaijani
bill that also put forth a claim to Nagorno-Karabakh, and said the
measures were void.
   Azerbaijani unrest broke out earlier this month as well on the
border with Iran, and included Lenkoran. Azerbaijanis yearning to
be united with their ethnic brethren across the frontier tore down
border fences and knocked guard towers and communication lines out
of commission.
   The Foreign Ministry says the border crossing will be eased, and
it is working with Iran on ways to keep the area calm.
   Azerbaijanis, most of them Shiite Moslems, held mass rallies to
protest the Armenian legislature's action and resumed a railroad
blockade of Armenia, which is predominantly Christian.
   Izvestia said that at a rally Thursday in Baku, Azerbaijan's
capital, protesters demanded that the republic leadership resign
for failing to solve the Nagorno-Karabakh problem. Speakers
demanded that all Armenians be deported from Baku and called for a
march to Nagorno-Karbakh.
   The national legislature in Moscow in November disbanded a
commission that imposed direct Kremlin rule on Nagorno-Karabakh, a
hilly region of 160,000 people. The resolution said the area is
part of Azerbaijan and would be controlled by local government
bodies under national supervision.

   The State Department responded Friday to
China's lifting of martial law in Beijing by issuing a notice to
U.S. travelers that some of the precautions it had recommended
beforehand are no longer in effect.
   Prior to China's announcement Thursday, the Department had

there was a significant presence of armed security forces because
of martial law.
   Travelers had been urged to avoid going out after dark in
Beijing and to refrain from photographing troops or military
installations.
   The new advisory deletes these references to the need for
precautions in Beijing but notes the travelers should still be
aware that visits to certain areas of the country are prohibited
without permission.
   It also notes that there are special restrictions on travel to
the Tibetan capital of Lhasa. In addition, visitors should also
ensure that all passports are current and they should avoid
carrying documents or other items that Chinese authorities might
consider objectionable.
   Chinese authorities imposed martial law on sections of central
Beijing last June as part of its effort to quell anti-government
demonstrations.

<HEAD>Ex-Policeman Says He Was Told to `Take Out' Black Activists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A white ex-policeman claims
security forces battling unrest were told to kill anti-government
activists and routinely tortured and assaulted blacks at random,
according to documents.
   Sgt. Barney Horn, who quit the force in October after 13 years,
detailed alleged police misdeeds in a 25-page affidavit obtained by
The Associated Press Friday after his story appeared in the
Afrikaans-language newspaper Free Weekly.
   He is the fourth former policeman in recent months to speak out
about alleged police abuses.
   Horn said that when he was battling unrest near the southern
city of Port Elizabeth in 1984, members of the police Security
Branch circulated pictures of local anti-apartheid activists.
   ``We were told that these people had been identified as
instigators ... and if we saw them we had to take them out,'' Horn
said. ``Everyone present understood that to mean `kill them.'''
   In recent months, three former policemen _ one white and two
black, have said they were part of police hit squads that
assassinated anti-apartheid activists on orders from superiors.
   One of the men, Butana Nofomela, has pleaded guilty to killing
an anti-apartheid attorney in 1981. The two other men, who say they
were part of the same killing, have fled South Africa.
   Opposition groups say there have been more than 60 unsolved
killings of activists the past decade. The opposition has long
accused the security force of killing anti-government activists.
   President F.W. de Klerk said last month he would not appoint a
judicial commission to investigate the alleged police deaths
squads, a decision that has drawn widespread criticism.
   Horn alleged that when he worked in Boksburg, east of
Johannesburg, 90 percent of police interrogators tortured black
suspects. One of the most common methods was to place a wet bag
over the suspect's head so he could not breathe.
   It also was common practice to attach electrodes to suspects'
genitals and administer electric shocks during interrogation, Horn
said.
   When patrolling the townships, he said blacks ``would be
attacked by the (police) members at random ... hit with the long,
thick batons, kicked, punched, rifle-butted.''
   ``The members would jump into the vehicle, the vehicle would go
to another road and the same process would be repeated,'' he said.
``Plenty of people were injured this way. We were never ordered to
stop doing this.''
   Police headquarters in Pretoria said Horn's allegations would be
investigated ``at a high level without delay.''
   Horn left South Africa on a flight Thursday and fears his former
colleagues may try to harm him, said a source who has been in
contact with Horn.
   Horn said he spoke out because, ``to continue a Christian life,
I cannot have these skeletons hanging in my cupboard.''
   In a related development, a British citizen told the Free Weekly
newspaper that he bombed the London offices of the African National
Congress guerrilla movement in 1982 while working for the South
African police.
   Free Weekly said it interviewed Peter Casselton in Pretoria,
where he is in hiding and attempting to leave South Africa.
   Police have denied involvement in the bombing of the ANC office.

   The State Department, in a travel advisory, said the security

for random violence remained. There has been no direct threat to

<HEAD>Cheney Orders Hiring Freeze for Civilian Defense Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered a freeze
on hiring civilians at the Defense Department for the rest of this
fiscal year, the Pentagon announced on Friday.
   Cheney said in a statement he was forced to take the step to cut
costs and because of the sweeping international changes that are
forcing limits on the department.
   ``As the armed forces are reduced over the long term in light of
limited budgets, a changing world situation, and future negotiated
agreements, the department must make corresponding reductions in
the size of the civilian work force that supports the armed
forces,'' Cheney said.
   But the release announcing the step cautioned that ``department
officials do not know how much the work force will be reduced by
the freeze.''
   The hiring freeze _ which will be in effect from now until Sept.
30, 1991 _ applies to all Department of Defense civilians
worldwide, including part-time and temporary employees. The
department currently employs 927,000 civilians on a full-time bases
and another 123,000 on a temporary or part-time basis, the Pentagon
said.
   As many as 80,000 workers normally retire or otherwise leave
that work force each year, the statement said.
   There are 2.1 million armed forces personnel in uniform.
   The hiring freeze came one day after Cheney announced his
program for trimming the Pentagon's huge purchasing bureaucracy,
which he predicted would cut 42,000 military and civilian job slots
and save $39 billion over a five-year period.
   That step is aimed specifically at reducing the complex system
of civlian and military officials who buy equipment and supplies
for the department.
   The prohibition on the hiring of civilians is directed at
cutting the department-wide civilian work force ``by attrition
rather than reductions-in-force, thereby minimizing economic
dislocation of civilian employees,'' the statement said.
   The statement noted that there are exceptions to the freeze,
such as hiring commitments made by appointed officials prior to the
announcement of the freeze; those positions deemed by top DOD
officials to be essential to ``maintain an important national
defense capability'' and those positions essential to meet
``medical, safety or security requirements.''
   The secretary or deputy secretary of defense must personally
authorize all political appointements, the statement added.

<HEAD>Court Says FCC Must Reconsider Approval of TV Station Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission must
reconsider its decision to allow the 1986 sale of six
Spanish-language television stations to a division of Hallmark
Cards, a federal appeals court said Friday.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S Court of Appeals in Washington
said the commission apparently violated its own rules for license
transfers when it allowed the sale to take place before it had
concluded an investigation into claims that foreigners had
excessive influence over the stations.
   Spanish International Communications Corp. and Bahia de San
Francisco sold the stations to Univision Holdings, a subsidiary of
Kansas City, Mo.-based Hallmark, in 1986 for $309.6 million after
an FCC administrative law judge denied SICC and Bahia's license
renewal applications.
   The judge found that foreign interests wielded too much
influence over the stations' financing, programming and management,
the appeals court said.
   The FCC judge said the Azcarraga family, which owns a Mexican
media conglomerate, exerted excessive control over SICC through its
president, Reynald V. Anselmo. Anselmo also was a principal in
Bahia.
   But an FCC review board later approved the renewal applications
of SICC and Bahia, subject to the prompt transfer of the licenses
to Univision. The selection of the Hallmark division arose from the
settlement of an unrelated stockholders' suit against SICC.
   The 9th U.S. District Court in California, which oversaw the
stockholders' suit, subsequently accepted Univision's offer over a
bid from TVL Corp., a party in the suit.
   Hallmark spokesman Charles Hucker on Friday said the case was a
procedural matter and ``We anticipate no impact on us. Univision
continues to operate the stations.''
   Univision has no plans for selling the six stations, which
Hallmark spokesman Steve Doyal said comprised the nation's leading
Spanish-language TV network.
   Univision paid $286 million for SICC stations KMEX-TV, Los
Angeles; WLTV, Miami; KWEX-TV, San Antonio; WXTV, Paterson, N.J.;
and KFTV, Hanford, Calif.
   Univision paid $23.6 million for Bahia's KDTV, San Francisco,
Doyal said.
   Hispanic Broadcasting Limited Partnership and Hispanic
Broadcasting System had challenged the license transfers and asked
the FCC to consider their competing applications for the stations.
The FCC refused.
   TVL also challenged, saying the commission had violated its
rules prohibiting a sale of a station at full value while the
station's licensee is under investigation.
   Appeals court Judge Abner J. Mikva, writing for the majority
Friday, agreed. He said the FCC had made an exception to its
transfer policy ``without articulating a clear rationale for this
departure.''
   TVL also said the commission short-circuited its ``distress
sale'' policy, which allows a broadcaster in danger of losing its
license to sell the station quickly to a minority-owned company for
75 percent of the station's fair-market value.
   The commission ruled that the sale would not unacceptably
diminish ``the deterrence of licensee wrongdoing'' and that it also
should not intervene in the California court's decision.
   The appeals court panel upheld the commission's decision to
decline to accept the competing applications or to review the
actions of the California court, but it said the FCC had departed
from its license transfer policy.
   It remanded the case to the FCC to either complete the license
renewal proceedings or explain a new policy that would modify its
license transfer rules.
   Mikva was joined by Judge Harry T. Edwards. But Judge Stephen F.
Williams dissented in part, saying Hispanic Broadcasting System and
Hispanic Broadcasting Limited had not shown they suffered material
injury.

   A military tribunal Friday convicted a
police major of attempted murder and sentenced him to 19 years in
prison for shooting protesters who toppled Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Defense counsel Lica Magdea said in an interview that hundreds
of other loyalists are awaiting trial or preliminary hearings under
armed guard, confined to a large, unfilled army swimming pool. The
military prison _ the only one large enough for all the suspects _
was destroyed during fighting.
   The panel reached its verdict following two days of sometimes
emotional proceedings after police Maj. Ioan Botarel was identified
by two witnesses as having fired the shots Dec. 22 that wounded
three demonstrators.
   It was the fifth trial of Ceausescu loyalists since last week.
The feared secret police, or Securitate, are accused of crimes
against the people during the 24-year Ceausescu rule and the
violent revolt that ended it.
   Magdea said some of those detained have been confined to the
pool for nearly 24 hours a day for up to two weeks.
   His client, who broke a foot after leaping from a second-story
window during the fighting, had been detained at an infirmary, said
Magdea.
   Military officials did not allow reporters to see the detained
suspects, saying they were not authorized to issue such orders.
   Security was high inside the courtroom, with about 10 soldiers
leaning on submachine guns keeping a watchful eye on the crowd.
   About 1,500 townspeople crowded into the gloomy and curtained
auditorium of Sibiu's infantry officer's academy booed and jeered
as Botarel insisted he had only been following orders.
   His passionate statement ended with ``Long live free Romania,
long live the truth.''
   As Botarel, 45, fumbled with the microphone at one point, an
audience member hissed: ``What's the matter, you don't know how to
handle it because it isn't a gun?''
   Immediately after being sentenced, Botarel announced he would
appeal. The tribunal, presided over by Judge Mircea Badila and
another civilian judge, gave him one year less than the minimum
term for murder, 20 years.
   Romania abolished the death sentence following the executions of
Ceausescu and his wife Elena Dec. 25 for genocide and other crimes.
But some of those in attendance said capital punishment was the
only just penalty for Ceausescu's Securitate henchmen, who last
month killed thousands of civilians and soldiers fighting for
democracy.
   Late Friday in Bucharest, the capital, interim President Ion
Iliescu told thousands of anti-Communist demonstrators that a
referendum would be held Jan. 28 on whether the death penalty
should be reinstated for Securitate members.
   ``These people must be destroyed because they are tyrants
shooting against unarmed children,'' exclaimed Laurean Hagdea, who
attended Friday's trial. ``They don't have the right to defend
themselves, they are dirt.''
   Hagdea, 47, said his 26-year-old daughter was among those
wounded by gunfire from the nearby Securitate headquarters, where
Botarel and others shot at demonstrators.
   Initial euphoria in the wake of the revolution has been tempered
by growing concern that many relatively senior Ceausescu loylists
who switched sides in the first days of the turmoil would never be
tried for earlier crimes.
   In his closing statement, Magdea, the defendant's
court-appointed lawyer, argued along those lines. ``We should first
try to judge those who gave them the orders and then those who
carried them out, because in our opinion those who gave the orders
are the most guilty,'' he said.
   He suggested those who fired from the windows of the Securitate
building _ now a burned-out hulk _ were not local police but
``specialists, brought in from Bucharest by Nicu Ceausescu,'' son
of the dictator and former Communist Party head of Sibiu district,
now awaiting trial in the capital.
   ``We want the terrorists to be judged,'' he exclaimed. ``Those
are the guilty ones.''
   He was alluding to Ceausescu bodyguards, elite units thought to
have been about 2,000 strong. Many of them remained loyal to the
dictator and his family even after the elder Ceausescus were
executed, and continued fighting army troops into early this month.
   Col. Anton Socaciu, the military prosecutor, asked for a harsh
sentence, dismissing the defendant's argument that he shot at gaps
in the crowd instead of into the demonstrators.
   ``The people in this hall will rise in revolt when they hear
such explanations from the defense,'' he proclaimed, to applause
from the crowd.
   ``The gun is made for killing people and not for writing
letters,'' he exclaimed. ``When you shoot, you shoot to kill.''
   In a separate trial expected to extend into Saturday, 46-year
old Constantin Bosotenau, chief administrator of the Sibiu
Communist Party, pleaded innocent to charges of attempting to
embezzle part of the party payroll as the revolution broke out, and
aiding the younger Ceausescu by providing him with false license
plates to escape.
   Sibiu, 150 miles nortwest of Bucharest, was the site of some of
the fiercest fighting during the revolt, and the army warned Friday
of the possibility that snipers remain at large.

   For the second time in recent weeks, the Bush
administration put off issuing an interagency agreement Friday
aimed at more clearly establishing guildelines for protecting
wetlands, prompting criticism from environmentalists.
   The Environmental Protection Agency said in a statement that it
was approving a 15-day extension for further discussions over the
final wording of an agreement between the EPA and the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers. Last month a decision was posponed for 30 days.
   The memorandum of agreement has been the subject of weeks of
discussions within the administration after members of Alaska's
congressional delegation complained to the White House that it
threatens oil and gas development in the state.
   The EPA and Corps of Engineers tentatively agreed last November
on the memorandum, which outlines specific actions and procedures a
developer must take in a wetland area, including actions to
mitigate environmental damages to the wetlands and a requirement
for compensation, possibly by developing other wetlands, if
mitigation is inadequate.
   Environmentalists argue that the Alaskans' concerns are
unfounded and that the actual opposition is coming from the oil
industry, which sees the agreement as making it more expensive to
explore for oil in wetland areas, especially over vast areas across
northern Alaska.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, intervened last month with White
House Chief of Staff John Sununu to try to reach an accommodation,
according to sources, who spoke under the condition that they not
be identified by name.
   The EPA said in a statement Friday that the 15-day extension of
deliberations stemmed from ``the high level of interest'' in the
agreement.
   Environmentalists immediately criticized the delay, suggesting
that Bush was reneging on promises to do everything possible to
stop the dramatic disappearance of wetlands in the country in
recent years.
   ``We can only assume that the delay is intended to give the oil
industry more time to sink the president's clear commitment to a
national policy of no net loss of wetlands,'' complained Jay Hair,
president of the Wildlife Federation in a statement responding to
the continuing delays in approving the agreement.
   EPA spokesman David Cohen said the agency's does not consider
the continuing deliberation over the memorandum of agreement with
the Corps of Engineers as central to the administration's overall
wetlands policy.
   Although Bush repeatedly has said he is committed to a goal of
taking actions to halt the decline of wetlands, specifics on how to
achieve that goal have yet to be developed.

<TEXT>
   A Senate committee chairman has asked for an
investigation of the Food and Drug Administration's review of a
milk cow hormone, alleged to have been inadequate by a fired FDA
veterinarian, it was learned Friday.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Agriculture
Committee, asked the General Accounting Office, the investigative
arm of Congress, to look into allegations made by a Dr. Richard
Burroughs about genetically engineered bovine somatotropin, a
hormone that boosts a cow's milk production.
   The hormone also is produces naturally in the cow's body.
   Leahy also asked the GAO to look into:
   _The adequacy of FDA risk assessment for genetically engineered
products.
   _The process used to evaluate outside comments about the safety
of a product.
   _Whether Congress should be concerned about the overall approach
FDA is taking.
   ``The Congress is being asked with increasing frequency to reach
conclusions about whether particular products of biotechnology have
been adequately reviewed and whether use of these products may
present unacceptable risks to human health, animal health or the
environment,'' Leahy said in his letter to the GAO, which was
provided to The Associated Press on Friday.
   Burroughs met with Agriculture Committee staff in November and
has said in interviews that the FDA has been so eager to approve
the growth hormone that it has ignored flaws in safety studies.
   He said that in 1986 through 1988, when he was assigned to
review private research on the hormone, he noticed problems with
reproduction and mastitis, inflamed udders, among the cows injected
with the hormone.
   Although the FDA has approved milk for human consumption from
cows treated with the hormone, it has not yet given its OK to
commercial use of the drug, which is manufactured by Monsanto, Eli
Lilly, Upjohn and American Cyanamid.
   Burroughs has accused the FDA of toning down criticism of
research on the hormone at the request of the chemical companies.
   Richard Lehmann, director of the division of production drugs at
FDA, said studies by the drug companies had at times been rejected
and that research was conducted into whether cows suffered from the
problems Burroughs raised.
   Lehmann said the hormone could delay breeding, but that is
common among cows that produce a lot of milk. He said that drug
company findings of mastitis were the result of the conditions
under which the studies were performed.
   Manufacturers of the drug say the FDA review has been the most
thorough of any study of animal drugs.
   But Leahy said ``we must take extraordinary steps to guarantee
the safety of this product.''
   He has written three letters to the FDA saying that an
independent scientific body should review the bovine hormone ``in
order to allay public concern.''
   ``I am particularly concerned that human health issues raised by
bovine somatotropin be evaluated thoroughly,'' Leahy said in a
Sept. 7 letter. ``The public concern already expressed about this
product makes imperative additional review and additional
understanding of the risks to human health and safety.''
   Normal milk contains small amounts of bovine somatotropin
produced naturally by the cow. The FDA says milk from cows given
the genetically engineered version of the hormone contains no more
than normal amounts and is safe to drink.

   Communist Premier Hans Modrow on Friday
scrapped bitterly opposed plans to form a new secret police force,
an effort to hold together his coalition government until elections
in May.
   He also promised the old security agency would be dismantled by
June 30 and announced he would fire Peter Koch, who was named to
oversee the dissolution.
   Lawmakers cleared the way for joint ventures with Western
companies for the first time, and the ADN news agency said the
financially scrapped government would close some foreign diplomatic
missions to save money.
   Modrow is struggling to keep four increasingly assertive
non-Communist parties in his coalition and head off severe
opposition criticism.
   Late Friday, he said he could imagine giving to the opposition
deputy ministerial posts in areas such as health or the environment.
   His remarks, in an interview on West Germany's ZDF TV network,
elaborated on a broadly worded offer Thursday to bring reform
groups into a government coalition.
   But Friday's announcements appeared to give Modrow only a
breathing space.
   Threats came of further strikes, and his government partners and
the opposition demanded proof the old state security agency is
being dismantled, and attacked a new draft election law.
   As Parliament convened, taxi drivers honking their horns drove
by to press demands ranging from more democracy to scrapping the
state-run labor union.
   Modrow told legislators, ``Through May 6, no offices will be
created in this area.'' East Germany's first free elections are
scheduled May 6.
   Members of the 500-member Parliament responded with applause.
   The premier's plans to create a new security agency to replace
the hated ``Stasi'' force led to a protest around Parliament on
Thursday, and two non-Communist parties in the coalition government
threatened to quit.
   For decades, East Germany's hard-line leaders used the secret
police to spy on citizens, crush dissent and catch those who dared
to step out of line.
   The agency was dissolved after the fall pro-democracy movement
that led to the ousters of hard-line party leader Erich Honecker
and his cronies.
   Modrow said some kind of internal security force was needed to
guard against neo-Nazis and others, but opponents said decisions on
internal security should wait until a democratically elected
government takes over.
   Parliament on Friday also passed a constitutional change that
will allow joint ventures with foreign companies, but officials
later said foreign shareholding in most cases would be limited to
49 percent.
   East Germany is seeking more foreign capital to help boost its
sagging economy, and ADN said several diplomatic missions abroad
would be closed to help save money.
   Later, the government announced price increases for children's
clothes, whose production is heavily subsidized by the state.
   East Germans will receive higher child support payments from the
government to compensate for the price increases, which are aimed
at foreigners seeking bargains.
   The government also wiped out state subsidies for flowers,
Christmas trees and other plants. The subsidies _ amounting to $73
million at the official exchange rate _ had become symbolic of the
country's economic imbalances.
   The country is facing a budget deficit of up to 7 billion marks,
nearly $1.3 billion at the official rate.
   Also Friday, legislators voted to open disciplinary proceedings
against Supreme Court Chief Judge Guenter Sarge and Harry Harland,
the nation's No. 2 prosecutor. They are accused of dragging their
feet in prosecuting corruption cases against former leaders.
   Non-Communist partners in the coalition government, in addition
to opposition parties, still are at odds with Modrow over a draft
election law that would ban campaign aid from abroad. This would be
a slap in the face to West Germans eager to support the
non-Communists.
   ``An election law in this form is not acceptable to us,'' said
Lothar de Maiziere, chairman of the Christian Democrats, on Friday.
   The Christian Democrats and Liberal Democrats hold seven seats
in the 28-member Cabinet.
   Lothar Pawliczek, a spokesman for the opposition Social
Democrats, called the draft law ``a scandal.''
   Opposition sources said a massive strike was being prepared in
Gera, Karl-Marx-Stadt and other southern cities if a stalemate in
negotiations between Communists and opposition continues at the
next session Monday.

   A Marine fighter jet crashed during a
training flight Friday on approach to Willow Grove Naval Air
Station, injuring the pilot and damaging a business and nearby
houses, the Navy said.
   The pilot ejected before the jet hit the ground and burst into
flames, the Navy said. The pilot, Marine Capt. Duane Pandorf, 35,
was in stable condition at Abington Memorial Hospital, said
hospital spokeswoman Linda Miller.
   There were no other injuries, said Navy Ensign Barbara
MacStravic.
   Navy spokesman Rich Beth said the A-4M Skyhawk attack jet
crashed just off the base about 10:45 a.m. in Upper Moreland
Township, a Philadelphia suburb in Montgomery County north of the
city.
   Beth said he did not know whether the pilot reported trouble
before the crash. The military will handle the investigation, said
Frank Ghiorsi of the National Transportation Safety Board in New
York.
   Police said the plane clipped a one-story commercial building
and a home, then skidded along a city street. The wreckage came to
rest at a stop sign. Four cars were burned and five other houses
received minor damage, police said.
   ``We heard a very loud plane, it shook the building,'' said
Leanne Carbohn, who manages a nearby service station. ``Then we
heard this loud bang and all the electricity went out.''
   The pilot landed in the backyard of a home, his parachute
catching in a tree. One house caught fire, but the blaze was
quickly brought under control, and no one was in the house, fire
officials said.
   Philadelphia Electric Co. said 1,800 customers lost electric
service.
   The jet belonged to Marine Air Group 49, based at the Willow
Grove station. The single-seat jet's estimated value was about
$500,000.
   Marine Capt. Rich Steffens in Washington said there are about 60
A-4's left, all are assigned to Marine reserve units. The aircraft
has been in service since the 1950s and has a good safety record,
he said.
   The Pentagon said it was the second crash in a week involving an
A-4. The pilot walked away from a crash in Yuma, Ariz., with
bruises, the Pentagon said.

<HEAD>NBC Miniseries Controversy Won't Affect Relations, Mexico Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD HERZFELDER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite harsh Mexican criticism of an NBC-TV
series on the killing of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena, the
controversy will not affect working relations between the United
States and Mexico, a government spokesman said Friday.
   ``Now more than ever the relationship between our nations is
friendly, particularly among those dedicated to fighting drug
trafficking,'' said Fernando Arias, chief spokesman for federal
Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo.
   The criticism erupted following the Sunday-to-Tuesday broadcast
of ``Drug Wars,'' based on the 1985 murder of Drug Enforcement
Administration agent Camarena.
   The controversy reached a new pitch Friday when the government
newspaper El Nacional published a front-page story accusing
Camarena of being corrupt _ allegations heated denied by U.S.
officials.
   ``There is not a scintilla of evidence whatsoever that Enrique
Camarena was involved with the traffickers in any way other than an
adversarial role,'' DEA spokesman Frank Shults said in Washington.
   ``This isn't the first time that Mexican officials have tried to
squelch controversy over the Camarena case by asserting that
Camarena was corrupt,'' said Elaine Shannon, author of the book
``Desperados'' on which the miniseries was based.
   ``This is just a sort of desperate and rather pathetic effort to
try to appease the Mexican public,'' Shannon told The Associated
Press in Washington.
   Arias said he did not know anything about the report, but said
the series unfairly portrayed the Mexican criminal justice system
as corrupt from top to bottom. He stressed that President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari's administration has made great strides against
corruption and narcotics trafficking.
   The Mexican government on Wednesday officially protested
statements made on NBC News segments broadcast after the show, and
politicians and newspapers here chimed in.
   Comments about a possible invasion of Mexico, coming after the
Dec. 20 invasion of Panama to arrest Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega on
drug trafficking charges, drew particular anger.
   ``Mexico should not accept pressure on our sovereignty'' under
the pretext of fighting drugs or under any other, said Sen.
Porfirio Munoz Ledo, leader of the left-wing opposition in the
Mexican senate.
   Lloyd Siegel, executive producer for special broadcasts at NBC
News, said the network took pains to see that Mexico's point of
view was represented and ``we do not accept the charge that there
were any inaccuracies or inconsistencies'' in its reporting.
   U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte, speaking in Los Angeles, drew a
distinction between what happened in 1985 and the current situation.
   Arias, in an interview, noted Mexican authorities have seized
more than 36 tons of cocaine base since Salinas took office 13
months ago, surpassing the total seized in the previous 10 years.
   Mexican law enforcement sources said out of about 1,000 federal
narcotics agents at the end of 1988, about 300 have been jailed on
corruption, narcotics and other charges.
   Salinas has shown ``a great deal of political courage,''
commented Shannon. But she said the political and legal system
hasn't changed and Mexico remains an ``extremely dangerous place
for DEA agents.''
   In Mexico, opposition politicians attacked the Salinas
administration for failing to respond stiffly enough to the
``insult'' to Mexico's integrity and sovereignty.
   In what one Mexican source admitted was a ``reply'' to the
Camarena series, the government news agency Notimex transmitted an
unbylined story attributed to ``authoritative sources'' saying
Camarena had actually been killed because he betrayed the drug
traffickers he was working for.
   The report also appeared on the front-page of El Nacional and
other newspapers. U.S. officials noted the rumor was an old one
that had never been supported by evidence.
   Rafael Caro Quintero and Ernesto Fonseca Carrilla have been
sentenced to 40 years in prison in the Camarena killing. Twenty-six
others were also convicted and sentenced to lesser terms. There is
no parole in Mexico for drug-related offenses.

Edzna, in Campeche state, and then fly to Oaxaca.
   The Oaxaca visit also was to include trips to other
pre-Colombian ruins.
   About 3,000 Guatemalan refugees have worked on the Edzna

<HEAD>Mayor's Aide Allegedly Promised Contract For Donation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top aide to Mayor Marion Barry allegedly
promised to deliver a city contract to an undercover FBI agent
posing as a private contractor if the man first contributed to
Barry's 1986 re-election effort, according to court documents
unsealed Friday.
   The official, former city human services head David E. Rivers,
allegedly told an undercover FBI agent during an October 1986
meeting that he would be awarded a contract if he contributed money
to a Barry re-election fundraising effort Rivers was organizing in
Atlanta.
   According to the court records, Rivers said, ``Ya'll just do
this,'' gesturing to invitations to the fundraiser, ``It's (the
contract) done right now.''
   The court records were unsealed after a hearing in which a
federal judge denied a request by Rivers and prominent city
contractor John Clyburn that wiretap evidence gathered against them
be suppressed in their trial on bribery and conspiracy charges.
   The accusations against Rivers and Clyburn are the latest in a
long string that have been lodged against people close to the
mayor. Two deputy mayors and a dozen other officials have been
found guilty of various financial crimes committed in office during
Barry's 11-year administration.
   According to the documents, the FBI agent gave three separate
$500 donations to the Atlanta event.
   In addition, the FBI agent's dummy corporation gave $2,000 to
another fundraising effort after prominent contractor John Clyburn
informed the agent that contributing to and attending the event
would be essential to making ``this connection with the mayor.''
   In return for these awards, Rivers promised that the undercover
agent's company would be given a contract to conduct energy audits
at Saint Elizabeths hospital, a city-run mental health hospital.
   Rivers set the contract amount at just under $25,000, the
threshold for extensive review of proposed contracts, the documents
reveal.
   The government's account of the meeting was summarized in an
affidavit in support of a search warrant for a May 1987 search of
Rivers' home that was unsealed Friday.
   ``I'm sure it is the mayor's position that he would never have
been aware of anything illegal and never would have condoned it,''
said Barry spokeswoman Lurma Rackley. ``He never has condoned any
illegal use of office.''
   U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green ruled that the trials of
Rivers and Clyburn would start on March 20.
   The judge ruled they had no cause to dispute the validity of
wiretap evidence gathered during a 17-month undercover FBI probe
into city contracting practices that ended in May 1987.
   Rivers and Clyburn were indicted in May in connection with their
alleged scheme to steer more than $3 million worth of city
contracts from 1983 to 1987 to a firm headed by undercover FBI
agents. They could be sentenced to 50 years in prison.
   Neither would comment after Friday's hearing.
   Rivers, who left his job as secretary of the city when the probe
was revealed, was given a $79,500-per-year position last year
reviewing capital projects for the city's Public Works Department.

   Attorneys for Manuel Noriega huddled with his trial
judge Friday amid rumblings that the deposed Panamanian dictator
may be moved, and a federal magistrate set $1 million bail for a
co-defendant.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler met with Noriega's
attorneys in a closed-door session. The Miami Herald reported
Friday that they were expected to discuss moving the former
Panamanian dictator to a more secure federal facility until his
trial on drug trafficking charges.
   Miami attorney Frank Rubino has said he would fight efforts to
move Noriega because it would make it difficult to meet with him.
Rubino said the judge has precluded him from even using the word
``transfer'' in his public discussions because of security concerns.
   Speculation has centered on federal prisons in Atlanta and
Marion, Ill., as possible destinations.
   Hoeveler said through his staff that he cannot discuss efforts
to transfer Noriega, who is accused in a February 1988 indictment
of using Panama to protect cocaine shipments heading north and
drug-processing chemicals and drug money headed south.
   Meanwhile, U.S. Magistrate Peter Palermo agreed to $1 million
bail for Daniel Miranda, 36, who is charged with flying $800,000 in
laundered drug money from Fort Lauderdale to Panama. The decision
was immediately appealed by prosecutors, blocking Miranda's release.
   Miranda's attorney, Michael O'Kane, arrived in court with his
head swathed in a large, white bandage after he was attacked by a
masked man with a crowbar.
   Police identified O'Kane's alleged attacker as someone hired by
a former client. A suspect was in custody, but no details were
released on the arrest.
   In another development Friday, Rubino said he and co-counsel
Steven Kollin have added David Lewis of New York City to the
defense team. Lewis was an attorney in the ``Pizza Connection'' mob
case and is considered an expert on the federal Classified
Information Protection Act, which is expected to come into play
because of Noriega's longtime CIA association.
   New York attorney Barry Slotnik, who represented subway gunman
Bernhard Goetz, and Houston attorney Richard ``Racehorse'' Haynes
have mentioned their possible interest in the case. But Slotnick
said Friday he's no longer interested in the Noriega case.
   Rubino, however, told The Associated Press on Friday that he
mentioned their names to Noriega but ``he told me he has not called
them.''
   ``He told me that he is satisfied with our representation and
whoever we get,'' said Rubino. ``David Lewis is the first we've
added, but we're going to get four or six more from all over the
country _ the best in their fields, in their specialties.''

<TEXT>
   The violence of early star formation in
new galaxies may be a major source of cosmic X-rays, a mysterious
radiation that has puzzled astronomers for decades, two Columbia
University scientists said Friday.
   Astrophysicists David Helfand and Thomas Hamilton said they have
found seven galaxies reasonably near the Earth's own Milky Way
galaxy that are spewing out X-rays at a hotter rate than the
so-called background X-rays detectable all over the universe.
   Though they only found seven such galaxies, the scientists said
that further searches may reveal many more, showing perhaps that
such galaxies provide a high percentage of the cosmic X-rays in the
universe.
   ``These galaxies are representative of a larger population at a
greater distance that makes up (or emits) the bulk of the X-ray
background,'' said Hamilton. ``These that we see are only the
nearest neighbors.''
   The galaxies are called ``neighbors,'' said Helfand, because
``they are relatively nearby, only a couple of billion light
years'' away.
   This is considered close, astronomically.
   A light year is the distance that light travels in space in a
year, about 6 trillion miles.
   The discovery of X-ray emitting galaxies so close and seemingly
undergoing star formation, Helfand said, suggests that in the
history of the universe star formation continued up until
relatively recently. Most astronomers believe that star formation
took place in the early part of the 15 to 20 billion-year-old
universe and then tailed off.
   ``These galaxies may be bright X-ray sources because they are
undergoing an early stage of their evolution and still forming
massive stars,'' said Helfand. ``They may be a key link in being
able to study the evolution of galaxies.''
   X-rays are thought to be generated naturally in the universe
when interstellar gas is heated to millions of degrees. Such
heating can occur during the course of star formation when vast
amounts of matter are attracted to a core by gravitational force.
Black holes, bodies massive enough to create a gravitational field
that keeps even light from escaping, can also generate X-rays by
pulling material from nearby stars, Helfand said.
   X-rays cannot be detected on Earth, which is shielded by the
atmosphere. But satellites orbiting above the atmosphere can
measure the radiation.
   To find the X-ray emitters, Helfand and Hamilton gathered data
on 100 faint radio sources in a region of the sky about the size of
the full moon. These sources were then checked to see if they
coincided with X-ray hot spots that had been discovered by
satellites. Seven of the radio emitters were found to be bright in
X-rays, and these later were found by optical telescopes to be very
faint galaxies.
   Helfand and Hamilton presented their study at the 175th national
meeting of the American Astronomical Society.

   Two U.S. mountaineers and a Sherpa guide,
part of an American expedition climbing the world's sixth highest
peak, are missing and believed dead, Nepalese authorities said
Friday.
   The ministry of tourism said Gregory Barber, 21, of Kent, Wash.;
Scott William McGrath, 34, of Milton, Wash.; and Nuru Wangchu
Sherpa, 30; left for the summit of 26,787-foot Dhaulagiri I
mountain on Dec. 19 from a camp at 21,000 feet, telling team
members they planned to return within days.
   After they failed to return, two team members sent to search for
them spotted their companions' equipment but because of adverse
conditions were unable to get to it, the ministry said.
   The missing climbers are likely dead, according to a report from
one of the searchers, James David Yoder, 42, of Spanaway, Wash., it
said.
   The remainder of the seven-member expedition, led by Timothy
Brill, 31, a mountain guide also from Spanaway, left their base
camp for Katmandu en route home Thursday, the ministry said.

FBI announced.
   Spokesman Gregory Jones said three were Irish citizens and one a
Canadian. The four are believed to be members of the
``provisional'' faction of the IRA, he said.
   They were being charged with conspiracy to possess destructive
arms, violations of export control laws and other arms violations,
Jones said.
   The missile involved is the ``Stinger,'' a shoulder-fired weapon
supplied by the United States to troops for anti-aircraft defense.

<HEAD>Four Civilians Killed, Human Rights Official Accuses Military</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A human rights official accused the
Colombian military Friday of intentionally killing four civilians
and of indiscriminate bombing with jets in northern Colombia, where
battles are raging with leftist guerrillas.
   Jorge Gomez, president of the Human Rights Committee in
Barrancabermeja, said in an interview that the private organization
received ``testimony from witnesses and other proof'' that a naval
patrol opened fire Wednesday without provocation on a boat carrying
peasants on the Magdalena River.
   He refused to say what the other evidence was.
   Bogota's daily El Tiempo quoted an unidentified military
official Thursday as saying the patrol was searching the boat, and
found supplies destined for guerrillas, when it was fired on by
rebels.
   The patrol returned fire and the boat's passengers were killed
in the exchange, the official said, according to El Tiempo.
   A Defense Ministry spokeswoman said Friday she had no
information about the battle.
   Gomez said the two fisherman and two women killed in the attack
were buried late Thursday in Barrancabermeja, 149 miles north of
Bogota.
   He said two girls, aged 9 and 10, and a woman were wounded by
the naval patrol. One of the girls was in critical condition in an
area hospital suffering from a shot to the head, he said.
   Barrancabermeja is a few miles south of the zone where the
military has been battling leftist guerrillas this past week after
discovering what it called a rebel base camp.
   The guerrillas reportedly belong to the Colombian Revolutionary
Armed Forces, the National Liberation Army and the People's
Liberation Army, Colombia's three most active insurgent groups.
   Gomez said the air force had been bombing the area
indiscriminately. The radio network Caracol, quoting military
sources, reported this week that the air force was using A-37 jets
to bomb the zone, between Bolivar and Antioquia states.
   The only A-37 jets in Colombia's air force are eight that
arrived in the country last September as part of a $65 million U.S.
aid package to help in the country's fight against drug traffickers.
   The A-37 is a ground support aircraft that can be used for
reconnaissance, strafing and bombing. The Bush administration
placed no restrictions on the use of the aircraft.
   Gomez said several human rights officials have seen jets flying
over Barrancabermeja, then heard distant bombing. He added that
several refugees have provided witness accounts of indiscriminate
bombing by planes and machine gunfire from helicopters.
   Sonya Nevado, a councilwoman for Barrancabermeja, said a flood
of refugees had poured into the town as a result of the fighting.
She said another, larger group of refugees arrived in Yondo, a town
10 miles east.
   Nevado could not give exact refugee figures, but Gomez said at
least 110 peasants were being housed in a temporary shelter.
   Ms. Nevado said many civilians were trapped in the combat zone
because the army had cordoned it off. Gomez said the official
civilian death toll is sure to rise when rights officials and
doctors are allowed into the zone.
   Miguel Cuesta, rights director for the Patriotic Union, said the
leftist party demanded a government commission be allowed to visit
the area, but the military still had not responded to the demand.
   On Wednesday, a Colombian army official said four soldiers, a
police officer and at least 30 guerrillas were killed in battles in
seven states.
   The official, Gen. Hernan Manuel Guzman, said in a radio
interview that the military was carrying on ``the biggest
operations in recent memory'' against guerrillas in Antioquia and
Bolivar states.
   The Defense Ministry has still not released figures on the
number of dead and injured in the operations.
   On Thursday the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC),
the largest of Colombia's guerrilla groups, proposed in a letter to
President Virgilio Barco that a national referendum be held to
solve the country's conflicts.
   The letter, published Friday by El Tiempo, proposed a
constitutional assembly to reform the country's political system
after the referendum, which it said should be held April 29.
   The letter suggested the FARC was prepared to disarm and
transform itself into a political party if the government carried
out the proposed actions.
   Barco had made no response to the letter by late Friday. The
group has an estimated 5,000 armed members.

<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prominent Salvadoran leftist was
kidnappped Friday on his way to the international airport in
Guatemala, party officials said.
   Hector Oqueli Colindres, deputy secretary-general of the
National Revolutionary Movement (MNR), was abducted by armed men
about 7 a.m., the group said in a statement issued in San Salvador.
   The kidnappers also abducted a Guatemalan woman who was giving
Oqueli a ride to the airport, the MNR said.
   The leader of the MNR, Guillermo Ungo, was the presidential
candidate of a leftist coalition in the March elections in El
Salvador.
   Oqueli was on his way to catch a flight to Managua, where he was
to take part in an evaluation of the Nicaraguan electoral process,
said Mario Solorzano Martinez, secretary-general of the Guatemalan
Social Democrat Party.
   ``We condemn the kidnapping of Hector Oqueli Colindres, an
important figure in international socialism. It demonstrates again
the insecurity that exists in our country and we demand that the
authorities find out where he and (Gilda) Flores are being held,''
he said.
   Solorzano said he had spoken with Defense Minister Hector
Alejandro Gramajo, Vice President Roberto Carpio Nicolle and
Interior Minister Carlos Augusto Morales Villatoro and they had
assured him every effort would be made to find Oqueli and Flores.
   Oqueli's kidnapping comes against a backdrop of increasing
political violence both in El Salvador and in Guatemala, where
rightist factions have longstanding ties. The governing rightist
party in El Salvador, known by the Spanish acronym Arena, was
founded in Guatemala in the 1970s.
   The political murders and abductions that once made both
countries international pariahs have been on the rise in both
countries.
   In El Salvador, many labor leaders, liberal church workers,
human rights activists and left-of-center political leaders in El
Salvador, including Ungo, have gone into hiding or left the country
since a government crackdown following a rebel offensive in
November.

<HEAD>Art Director Lyle Wheeler, Winner of Five Oscars, Dead at 84</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lyle L. Wheeler, who won five Oscars for his
art direction on films including ``Gone With the Wind,'' has died
of complications stemming from pneumonia. He was 84.
   Wheeler died Wednesday at the Motion Picture Country Home and
Hospital.
   From the first of his 29 Academy Award nominations, for ``The
Prisoner of Zenda'' (1937), to his last, for ``The Cardinal''
(1963), Wheeler's career spanned some 400 films.
   Wheeler designed sets for many classic films in the late 1930s
to 1950s, and his first Oscars were awarded for ``interior
decoration'' before the award's title was changed to ``art
decoration-set direction.''
   He won his first Oscar for ``Gone With the Wind'' in 1939, but
he often told friends he was most proud of his work in 1945-46 on
``Anna and the King of Siam,'' the tale of an English school
teacher and a disciplinarian monarch. It won him his second Academy
Award.
   Wheeler later received Oscars for ``The Diary of Anne Frank,''
``The Robe'' and ``The King and I'' _ the musical based on ``Anna
and the King of Siam.''
   Other Academy Award nominations came with ``All About Eve,''
``Love is a Many Splendored Thing,'' ``Journey to the Center of the
Earth,'' ``David and Bathsheba'' and ``The Snows of Kilimanjaro.''
   In recent years Wheeler hit hard times and lost his five Oscars
when he could not pay a storage bill to house them. A sympathetic
fan bought and gave Wheeler his 1959 Oscar for ``The Diary of Anne
Frank'' last year.
   Born Feb. 12, 1905, in Woburn, Mass., Wheeler attended the
University of Southern California School of Architecture. He
eventually received an honorary degree there.
   His first film art direction credit came in 1936 for ``The
Garden of Allah,'' an early color experiment. His last was in 1975
for ``Posse.''
   Wheeler also did design work for television, including several
segments of ``Perry Mason'' and ``Lassie.''
   A widower, Wheeler is survived by six children, 13 grandchildren
and nine great-grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   A couple of the boys took a sawed-off shotgun and
tried to whack Butchy Doe again. As usual, the Charlestown
district's most famous hoodlum got a couple of holes put in him,
and as usual, he survived.
   Butchy _ also known as Arthur L. Doe Jr., age 30 _ is a
convicted bank robber. Police say he's a suspect in three murders.
Apparently somebody is very upset with him, too, because they've
tried three times to kill him in the past year.
   In May, he stopped three bullets when gunmen stormed his
girlfriend's apartment in Charlestown, a tough, mostly Irish,
mostly working-class district surrounding Bunker Hill. His
girlfriend was killed.
   In August, he was shot once in the chest outside a neighborhood
deli. At least three shots were fired. But the people working in
the store say they've never heard of Butchy Doe.
   Just after midnight Thursday, Butchy Doe was leaving the
Horseshoe Tavern, getting into a cab with a girlfriend when two men
came at him with the sawed-off shotgun.
   The girl was slightly wounded by the pellets and the taxi's rear
window was shattered. Butchy Doe was hit in his left arm and chest.
   At Massachusetts General Hospital, they'll tell you Doe is
alive. But they won't say anything else and most definitely won't
put your call through.
   ``We don't do this in all cases _ not even in many,'' a
spokeswoman said Friday. ``But we do it in certain cases and this
is one of them.''
   Doe was allowed to receive calls while in the hospital last
August, and no one was the better for it. An unidentified man
called to say, ``Don't bother stitching him up because when he gets
out we're gonna shoot him again.''
   The locals along Bunker Hill Street figure Doe's luck won't hold
out forever. Either Doe will end up in the wrong place at the wrong
time or his foes will develop better aim, they said Friday.
   Police say they've got plenty on Doe's would-be assassins, but
no one to testify. The whole town knows who's shooting at whom, but
no one wants to say. Charlestown's residents have always been
tight-lipped, but these days it's a matter of more than a community
code of silence _ it's a code of fear. The days when no one locked
their doors and most of the men earned their living down at the
Navy Yard are gone.
   These days everyone is fair game.
   ``This is a new generation of drugs and I resent it in a way,
but if you talk, you could get killed,'' said a woman who lives in
one of the lopsided houses along Bunker Hill Street. ``They go
knocking door-to-door.''
   Locals talk about how Doe was stabbed as a 14-year-old and shot
a year later. But they don't talk about much else.
   ``Store owners don't want him in their stores,'' said a lifelong
``townie,'' who like just about everyone wants to remain anonymous.
``But people are quiet about it. They have to be because guys like
this one are animals and they'll come looking for you.''
   There's a great deal of speculation on just why Butchy Doe is so
unpopular.
   ``There are different people trying to shoot him _ a whole
group,'' said Boston Police Sgt. Robert Thompson. ``He's made a lot
of enemies.''
   One theory is that Butchy Doe was involved in the May 1989 armed
robbery of $254,000 from a bank inside Mass General, that he drove
away in the getaway car and refused to share the loot. The robbery
has not been solved and Doe has not been charged in it.
   Another theory is that Butchy is the target of a vendetta for a
murder committed a decade ago.
   Police say they're sure it won't be long before Doe is back on
the street. The only thing more certain, they said, is that his
enemies will be out there too.

   An earthquake centered
between the Queen Charlotte Islands and the British Columbia
mainland struck on Friday, and residents reported seeing furniture
move and rooms shake.
   No damage or casualties were reported in the temblor, which was
centered underwater in Dixon Entrance, 60 miles west of Prince
Rupert on British Columbia's north coast.
   Preliminary estimates from the Pacific Geoscience Center in
Victoria set the tremor at about 5.0 on the Richter scale,
geophysicist Gary Rogers said.
   People in the Smithers and Terrace areas on the mainland and in
Queen Charlotte City felt the quake and said rooms shook and
furniture shifted.
   One woman in Lakelse Lake, south of Terrace, said, ``The house
felt like it was going to fall right off its foundations.
Everything was just sort of swaying. All the plants on the window
were swaying.''
   ``Telephone lines shook and buildings shook a bit, (as well as)
the aerial on my car,'' said Jim Kirkwood, a coordinator with the
provincial emergency program in Masset, on northern Graham Island
on the Queen Charlottes.
   A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake
as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph.

   Pipe bombs exploded before dawn
Friday, breaking windows at a U.S. Marine Corps recruiting office
and a Westinghouse Electric Co. store but causing no injuries,
police said.
   Police Col. Fernando Vazquez Gely declined to speculate on who
placed the explosives, but Friday night a caller to Channel 11
television station claimed responsibility in the name of the
underground pro-independence group the Macheteros.
   Various militant groups seeking independence for Puerto Rico, a
Spanish-speaking U.S. commonwealth, have claimed responsibility for
past pre-dawn, pipe-bomb explosions.
   Windows were blasted out and files damaged at the recruiting
office in the Santurce commercial district of San Juan, police
said. The blast caused $5,000 in damage.
   Owners of the Westinghouse store in Carolina, a town 10 miles
east of San Juan, said the explosion there caused $3,500 in damages
to the administrative office, police said.
   A statement from the police Explosives Division said the two
pipe bombs, which occurred at about 2:30 a.m., were of nearly
identical make.
   The police colonel said the FBI had joined the investigation.

   The search for an airplane carrying two
U.S. FDA officials centered Friday on a remote mountain in northern
Chile after a mule herder reported seeing what looked like ``a
crashed aircraft,'' police said.
   But the search was suspended Friday evening after a rescue plane
flew over El Toro mountain, 586 miles northeast of Santiago, and
found nothing, police said. They said they had dismissed the mule
herder's report.
   The air force said the search would resume Saturday and continue
for at least 10 days.
   The mountain is 50 miles east of Copiapo, a city bordering the
Atacama Desert 500 miles north of Santiago. The desert is one of
the driest areas in the world.
   The plane took off from Copiapo at 5:10 p.m. Wednesday for a
four-hour flight to Santiago.
   Lt. Jose Carreno, a police officer coordinating the search, said
that although the mule herder reported seeing something like a
crashed plane, he may have been confused because police reported
another plane crashing in the same area several years ago.
   The missing Cessna 206 was carrying two American officials of
the Food and Drug Administration and three Chileans. A daylong
search Thursday, involving at least 21 planes and helicopters and
land patrols, yielded no results.
   The search resumed early Friday, hampered for several hours by
unseasonal thick fog.
   The Americans aboard were identified as John Harty Jr. and
Patrick Pouzar, who arrived in Chile Saturday to check security
procedures in the harvesting, packing and transport of Chilean
fruits being exported to the United States.
   The Chileans are a police pilot, a government official and an
executive of the Fruit Exporters Association.
   The search centers around Copiapo because the Cessna's last
radio contact occurred 15 minutes after takeoff.

<TEXT>
   Northern J. Calloway, a Broadway actor and
16-year veteran of the ``Sesame Street'' children's television
program, has died at age 41.
   Calloway played David, the proprietor of Hooper's Store, from
1973 through last year, when he retired for medical reasons, the
show's producer said Friday. ``Sesame Street'' viewers were told
David was moving to Florida.
   Calloway died Tuesday at Stony Lodge Hospital, a private
psychiatric hospital in Ossining, the producer, Children's
Television Workshop, said in a statement.
   Dr. Louis Rowe, a deputy Westchester County medical examiner,
said the cause of death was undetermined as of Friday. Deborah
Hoffman, spokeswoman for Stony Lodge, declined to comment.
   A graduate of the High School for Performing Arts, Calloway
performed early in his career with the Lincoln Center Repertory
Company and at the Stratford, Ontario, Shakespeare Festival.
   Broadway credits included ``Pippin'' and ``Whose Life is it
Anyway?'' and he played the lead in the New Federal Theater's
production of ``The Louis Armstrong Story.''
   In a case that reached the U.S. Supreme Court, Calloway
unsuccessfully sued Marvel Entertainment Group and others for $44
million in 1982, accusing them of copyright violations on a
proposed animated science fiction movie.
   A federal judge dismissed the suit and fined Calloway, his
lawyer and his lawyer's firm under a court rule aimed at preventing
frivolous lawsuits and needless delay. An appeals court upheld the
fines against the lawyer and his firm; in December, the high court
threw out the fine against the firm.
   Calloway is survived by his fiance, Nancy Beaulieu, his mother
and a brother and sister.

   The governor on Friday declared a state
of emergency in 13 counties ravaged by severe windstorms and
flooding that left three dead, closed highways and forced thousands
of residents from water-damaged homes.
   ``The citizens of our state face millions of dollars in
damages,'' Gov. Booth Gardner said. ``Many people's entire lives
have been turned upside down. We need access to every resource
available to make repairs and to return life to normal.''
   The action triggers a state appeal to the federal government for
disaster funds.
   In Oregon, Gov. Neil Goldschmidt took an aerial tour of Clatsop
and Tillamook counties along the state's northern coast and said
the damage from the violent storms rivals that of the 1962 Columbus
Day storm, which left 35 people dead and caused $170 million in
damage.
   ``I think we just had another one,'' said the governor, who
declared a state of emergency in the two counties Tuesday.
   The three storms that battered the Pacific Northwest in the past
week were blamed for three deaths in Oregon and millions of dollars
in damage from falling trees and flooding.
   ``We're no place close to a total estimate of damage, but we'll
know a lot more by the end of next week,'' Goldschmidt said. ``We'd
like to see that everybody who deserves assistance finds some way
to get it.''
   In Washington, the Chehalis River spared Aberdeen from flooding
early Friday when high water began emptying into the ocean, leaving
an 80-mile brown swath in southwestern Washington.
   Flooding along the Chehalis and elsewhere in Washington left
three dead, forced thousands from their homes, closed highways and
caused millions of dollars in damage.
   The Chehalis crested near Aberdeen early Friday, coinciding with
an easterly wind and no more rain to spare the town from flooding,
said Rita Kepner, spokeswoman for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
   The National Weather Service cancelled flood warnings for all
Washington rivers.
   Eight western Washington rivers jumped their banks after four
days of heavy rain, with the worst flooding along the Chehalis and
its tributaries.
   At the height of the flood, an estimated 3,000 of Lewis County's
57,000 residents were forced to leave their homes. The business
area of Centralia, 80 miles south of Seattle, was especially hard
hit.
   Royce Walls, state Transportation Department superintendent at
Chehalis, said two northbound and one southbound lane of Interstate
5 were reopened Friday after being closed by water Tuesday. Some
northbound traffic was able to use city streets to bypass the water
Thursday, but southbound motorists had a 60-mile detour over
secondary roads.
   Mudslides and washouts cut both the north-south and east-west
mainlines for Burlington Northern Railroad. Washouts were near
Vader, south of Centralia, and near U.S. 2 at Stevens Pass,
northeast of Seattle.
   The north-south Burlington Northern mainline between Seattle and
Portland was reopened Friday, after washing out Tuesday near Vader,
railroad spokesman Howard Kallio said.
   Lynn O'Conner, Grays Harbor County spokeswoman, said about half
of the 600 residents in and around Oakville and Porter had been
evacuated. Some 23 county roads in the area were under water and
impassible, officials said.
   Three people were rescued Thursday after spending the night in
the back of a dump truck that became stuck near Oakville. The truck
was loaded with wood, and Karen Layman of Centralia said she, Ron
McNeal of Centralia and Hugh Jameson of Grand Mound were able to
build a fire to keep warm.
   Damage was still being assessed, but Kate Heimbach, state
emergency management director, said losses easily will be ``several
million dollars in each county.'' She said several bridges were
lost and substantial road damage is expected.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Egyptian novelist, short-story writer and
journalist Ihsan Abdel-Kuddous died after suffering a stroke and
spending 10 days in a coma, Misr International Hospital reported
Friday. He was 71.
   The hospital said without elaborating that Abdel-Kuddous, whose
works were translated into several languages, died Thursday night.
After Naguib Mahfouz, who won the 1988 Nobel Prize in literature,
Abdel-Kuddous was among the best-known novelists in the Arabic
language.
   He also wrote regular syndicated columns in Cairo's
government-owned newspapers and magazines. In his column, ``At a
Cafe on Politics Street,'' he tackled current issues through the
device of cafe customers talking.
   Both his parents were actors. His mother also was a writer and
Abdel-Kuddous began his writing career in a magazine she founded.
   He wrote at least 60 novels and collections of short stories,
mostly psychological studies of political and social behavior. Many
became movies. Some of his stories were criticized for their sexual
content.
   The writer also ran into trouble occasionally with the
authorities. He was detained in the late 1940s for articles about
corruption in high places under King Farouk. Gamal Abdel Nasser,
who deposed the king in a 1952 military coup, twice detained
Abdel-Kuddous for articles critical of the military.
   Abdel-Kuddous survived three attempts on his life.
   Among his works translated into English were ``I Am Free,''
``The Bus Thief'' and ``A Boy's Best Friend.''
   He liked to give his books attention-grabbing titles in Arabic _
``My Father Atop a Tree,'' ``Don't Snuff Out the Sun,'' ``She Fell
Into a Sea of Honey'' and ``I Can Think While I Dance.''
   Survivors include his widow and two sons.

filed by one of the four youths he shot on a train five years ago.
   ``It could have been better, it could have been worse,'' Goetz
said after his legal debut in a 30-minute session before state
Supreme Court Judge Barry Salman.
   Attorney William Kunstler, who is representing shooting victim
Darrell Cabey in the civil lawsuit, said ``time will tell'' if
Goetz can become a competent counselor.
   Goetz, 42, looked decidedly un-lawyerlike in a white shirt open
at the neck and blue jeans and spoke softly in making his
arguments. Later he defended himself to reporters during a short
question-and-answer session.
   ``Mr. Cabey's lawyers have repeatedly said race was a major
factor in this case. Just because William Kunstler has repeated it
several times doesn't mean it's true,'' Goetz said.
   ``Darrell Cabey was part of a group that was in the process of
getting ready to mug me,'' Goetz said.
   In court, the judge ordered Kunstler to have a lawyer examine
Cabey to determine whether the plaintiff is competent to be
questioned by Goetz. Cabey, now 24, was paralyzed from the waist
down in the Dec. 22, 1984, shooting.
   Goetz, a self-employed electrical calibrator, has filed a $40
million libel action against Cabey, his mother, and attorneys
Ronald Kuby and Kunstler. Again acting as his own attorney, Goetz
charged the two lawyers libeled him when they described him as a
``walking time bomb and a racist.''
   Goetz served 8{ months in jail on a weapons conviction stemming
from the subway shooting after a legal battle which reached the
U.S. Supreme Court.

   Jampacked roads in 29 U.S. cities cost drivers
$24.25 billion in 1986 through traffic delays, wasted fuel and
higher insurance premiums, according to a study by the Texas
Transportation Institute.
   Los Angeles was the most congested city in the survey, which did
not look at such notoriously jammed cities as New York, Chicago or
Boston.
   The study also concluded that congestion is getting worse
instead of better in all but two of the cities studied.
   A companion survey of business leaders in 13 of the cities found
51 percent who said traffic affected their business, and of those
88 percent said the effect had been negative.
   ``Traffic congestion, expected during the `rush' hour, can now
be encountered much of the day on one or more major freeways in
almost all large urban areas,'' said the study, funded by state and
federal highway departments.
   The survey by the institute, based at Texas A&amp;M University,
reviewed existing traffic data for 1982 through 1986 in seven Texas
cities and 22 outside the state.
   New York, Chicago, Boston and Washington were left out because
researchers were looking for ``automobile-based cities'' comparable
to those in Texas.
   ``Mobility, for almost all Americans, is defined by the
automobile,'' the study said. ``In many cities with significant
population growth since 1950, interstate freeway construction and
other federal and state projects provided excellent urban mobility
during the 1960s and 1970s.
   ``Many urban areas can attribute the rapid increase in
population and economic development, in part, to the good
transportation system provided ... in newer, less dense cities.''
   It said a relative slowdown in road construction in the 1970s
did not allow streets and freeways to keep pace with demand.
   Los Angeles got a 1.42 congestion rating. The rating is the
result of a mathematical formula taking into account such things as
miles traveled daily and available freeway and arterial miles. A
rating of 1.0 or higher is considered to be congested.
   Other cities with a rating of 1.0 or higher were: San
Francisco-Oakland, 1.24; Houston, 1.21; Phoenix, 1.18; Atlanta,
1.15; Miami, 1.10; Seattle-Everett, Wash., 1.09; Dallas, 1.05;
Denver, 1.01; and San Diego, 1.00.
   The least congested cities were: Kansas City, Mo., 0.6; Oklahoma
City, Okla., and Corpus Christi, Texas, 0.71; El Paso, Texas, 0.75;
and Memphis, Tenn., and Salt Lake City, both 0.77.
   A separate congestion cost index figured in such things as
delays _ based on $8.20 an hour in salary, plus increased fuel
costs and higher insurance costs in the congested areas.
   Again Los Angeles topped the list, costing $9.44 billion, more
than a third of it in higher insurance premiums. Next came San
Francisco-Oakland, $2.69 billion; Houston, $1.67 billion; Miami,
$1.3 billion; and Dallas, $1.11 billion.
   At the bottom were Corpus Christi, $20 million; El Paso, $40
million; Indianapolis, $65 million; Salt Lake City, $70 million;
and Albuquerque, N.M., $105 million.
   ``The study was performed in order to help planners and city
administrators, to give them some information they can use,'' said
researcher Diane Bullard. ``It's easy to talk about congestion, but
if you don't have any hard figures, it is more difficult to do
something about it.''
   Congestion has worsened over the years, Ms. Bullard said, as
work centers have dispersed and automobile trips have become more
than just a simple ride to work.
   ``Within the last five to 10 years, we have seen increased
suburb to suburb commuting patterns,'' she said, making it more
difficult to alleviate congestion with mass transit. In addition,
people driving to multiple destinations, such as stopping by the
bank and laundry on the way to work, increase the difficulty of a
solution.
   Overall, congestion in the cities worsened by 12 percent from
1982 to 1986, the researchers said, led by Atlanta, whose index
went from 0.89 to 1.15, a 29 percent increase.
   Louisville and Oklahoma City were the only cities that saw
improvements during the period.

   Shining Path guerrillas killed two local
officials and five peasants in separate incidents in the Andean
highlands, police said Friday.
   The police said six guerrillas broke into the home of the police
chief of Chilca, 140 miles east of Lima, Thursday night and shot
and killed him.
   A note was left next to the body saying ``This is how Apristas
die'' _ a reference to the governing Aprista Party of President
Alan Garcia.
   In a similar incident, seven rebels dressed as police shot and
killed the police chief of Huamachuco, 350 miles northeast of Lima,
after dragging him from his home Thursday night, the police said.
   They said guerrillas also killed five peasants Thursday in the
town of Huanuhuanu, 545 miles southeast of Lima.
   The government says more than 17,500 people have died in
political violence since the Maoist Shining Path launched its armed
insurgency in 1980.
   Police have blamed the Shining Path for Tuesday's murder of
former Defense Minister Enrique Lopez, the most prominent victim of
the 10-year-old guerrilla war.
   Lopez was shot as he was parking his car near a shopping center
in a Lima suburb.

   One of the two officers who allegedly
shot and killed the leader of an abortive coup against Manuel
Antonio Noriega is hiding out in the Peruvian ambassador's
residence, the attorney general said Friday.
   Attorney General Rogelio Cruz identified the man as Maj.
Heraclides Sucre. He said the other officer, Capt. Ramon Diaz, is
in U.S. custody at Ft. Clayton.
   U.S. troops have cordoned off the Peruvian residence, where five
Noriega associates have taken refuge. Peru strenuously protested
the action.
   Cruz said Diaz and Sucre shot coup leader Maj. Moises Giroldi,
40, with semi-automatic rifles shortly after troops loyal to
Noriega put down the Oct. 3 barracks uprising.
   ``We don't know if Diaz or Sucre shot first,'' Cruz told a news
briefing.
   The now-defunct Defense Forces said Giroldi died in fighting
during the uprising, but reports soon surfaced that he and others
were summarily executed.
   Some reports said Noriega personally shot Giroldi.
   The dictator was ousted by the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion of Panama
and now awaits trial in Miami on drug charges.
   Cruz said Giroldi surrendered to Noriega at Defense Forces
headquarters at midday, about five hours after the uprising began
and was taken by helicopter to a barracks in Tinajitas, about six
miles away.
   Noriega's close confidante, Lt. Col. Luis Cordoba, interrogated
Giroldi until the next morning and then Giroldi was shot, Cruz said.
   U.S. troops reportedly searched scores of locations in Panama
City looking for Cordoba, who is one of a number of wanted former
Defense Forces officers.
   Civilian officials of the Noriega government are also on the
wanted list.
   Cruz said his office received more than 70 complaints against
former officials in the last two weeks.
   He said seven allegations were filed against Noriega, including
one accusing him of murdering participants in the Oct. 3 uprising.

<HEAD>New Czech TV Boss Named After Weeks Of Internal Struggle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has appointed a new
interim director of state television after weeks of bitter internal
struggle, the newspaper Lidova Demokracie reported Friday.
   ``The Czechoslovak government recalled Miroslav Pavel from the
position of director general of Czechoslovak television and
entrusted Jindrich Fairaizl with interim leadership of Czechoslovak
television,'' it said.
   It was not clear who requested Pavel's replacement, but
Fairaizl, 57, enjoys broad support from the Civic Forum,
Czechoslovakia's loosely shaped opposition group which is now in
the coalition government with the Communists.
   The appointment appeared to put an end to uncertainty as to
whether reformists wield enough influence to bring about changes at
the top.
   Fairaizl lost his job at Czecholsovak TV 20 years ago after the
``Prague Spring'' reforms were crushed and worked after that mostly
under an assumed name, before getting a job as a film director in
the Kratky Film studios.
   Pavel, a career journalist, was expelled from the Communist
Party after Soviet tanks ended the short-lived reforms of Alexander
Dubcek in 1968. He resurfaced as government spokesman for Premier
Ladislav Adamec in 1988.
   Adamec chose Pavel to head state TV less than two months ago
after revolutionary changes swept into power a new coalition
government not dominated by Communists. But then Adamec resigned as
head of government and Pavel's job security appeared tenuous.
   Some within Czechoslovak televison viewed Pavel as an able
professional, unjustly forced out, and others as a discredited
Communist affiliate.
   ``His main mistake was he did not communicate with any of the
newborn opposition groups inside television and tried to do
everything on his own,'' was TV editor Alena Pavlouskova's comment
about Pavel to The Associated Press.
   ``I have a feeling at least one third of the current TV staff
will have to go now. The situation is intolerable as it is.''
   Vit Spanhel, a TV writer, said, ``The situation inside
television is that of small, isolated groups, expressing mistrust
to one another.''

   Police said Friday at least 13
people were killed when houses were set on fire near the port city
of Durban, an area wracked for three years by fighting between
black factions.
   A group that monitors incidents of unrest for the anti-apartheid
Democratic Party said up to 18 people may have died in the Thursday
night fires in Cottonlands, about 15 miles north of Durban.
   Police said six boys, four girls and three women died. They
reported two arrests and said an investigation continued.
   The monitoring group said the attackers apparently were
supporters of the United Democratic Front, a nationwide
anti-apartheid coalition. It said the victims lived with people
linked to Inkatha, a relatively conservative Zulu organization.
   Some residents left the township Friday fearing further
violence, witnesses said. They said three people were killed Monday.
   Supporters of the Front and Inkatha have fought for supremacy in
Durban and the rest of Natal province for three years. More than
2,500 people have died.
   Both groups oppose South Africa's racial segregation policies,
but their tactics differ. The Front favors boycotts, strikes,
sanctions and other confrontational measures, which Inkatha does
not endorse. Both groups acknowledge they have large numbers of
youthful supporters they cannot control.
   In other developments Friday:
   _ Three people were killed and nine injured, including five
police and a one-year-old, in scattered incidents throughout the
country, police said.
   _ Police said they fired tear gas and rubber bullets in downtown
Johannesburg at lunchtime Friday to break up a demonstration by
about 100 striking black construction workers. No injuries or
arrests were reported.
   _ Officers reported arresting 85 railway strikers in connection
with informal courts allegedly set up by the strikers.
   ``Workers who did not want to participate in the strike were
allegedly beaten with sjamboks (whips), intimidated and some had
their houses burned down,'' police said.
   More than 20 people have died in strike-related violence since
25,000 rail employees walked off the job 10 weeks ago.

the bestseller lists for the Book Review.
   Clymer, 52, joined the Times in 1977 after reporting from
Moscow, New Delhi and Washington for The Sun in Baltimore and from
Washington for the New York Daily News. From 1978 to 1983, he was
the Times' national political correspondent.
   Lewis, 51, joined the Times as an editor in 1978 after holding
writing and editing positions at The Providence Journal, Newsday
and The Boston Globe. He was deputy editor of The Week in Review
from 1980 to 1985. For the last four months, on special assignment,
he has supervised coverage of education and the environment.
   Kagay, 47, joined the Times in 1987, having served as a polling
consultant for the paper. He holds a Ph.D. in political science
from the University of Wisconsin and was a National Science
Foundation post-doctoral fellow at the University of Michigan's
Institute for Social Research.
   From 1972 to 1982 he taught public opinion and survey research
at Princeton University. He then worked as a vice president at
Louis Harris &amp; Associates.

<TEXT>
   President Hosni Mubarak on Friday fired his
controversial interior minister, who has ordered harsh crackdowns
on Islamic militants and was recently quoted as saying they should
be killed.
   Interior Minister Zaki Badr lost his job less than a month after
surviving an apparent assassination attempt blamed on members of
the extremist groups.
   Mubarak replaced him with Mohammed Abdel-Halim Moussa, a career
police officer who had been serving as a provincial governor.
   Badr's sharp tongue and harsh security operations drew criticism
from the militants and from the nation's opposition political
parties.
   On Dec 16, a truck bomb went off in suburban Cairo only seconds
before Badr's motorcade arrived at his sports club. A medical
student from Assiut University was arrested at the site, and about
300 people were rounded up later.
   Almost 500 had been detained in Assiut the week before the
explosion after a provincewide security sweep typical of Badr's
methods.
   It began during an anti-government demonstration by religious
militants, who sought refuge in a mosque. Police moved in and began
arresting the fundamentalists. In the ensuing street battle, 10
policemen and 30 militants were wounded, many by gunfire.
   At one point last year, 6,000 alleged Moslem militants were held
in prison after being arrested during raids on areas considered
militant strongholds. Many militant leaders used their publications
to attack him.
   Mubarak last year praised the Interior Ministry's performance in
fighting extremists and maintaining public order. But the
president, a moderate and careful politician, apparently lost
patience after Badr reportedly insulted opposition groups, lawyers,
journalists and even his own Cabinet colleagues last weekend.
   Badr was quoted as saying in a free-wheeling speech at a rally
in the Nile Delta town of Benha that he wanted to kill all members
of the Moslem Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group with a national
following of hundreds of thousands. Though outlawed, some of its
members serve in Parliament under the umbrella of the opposition
Socialist Labor Party.
   Reports of Badr's comments were published on Tuesday and
Wednesday by the Socialist Labor Party's weekly newspaper Al-Shaab
and the weekly Al-Ahali, organ of the opposition National Unionist
Progressive Party.
   Al-Shaab said it had a tape recording of the speech.
   The minister reportedly cited a saying by Imam Shafei, a leading
Moslem scholar, to the effect that he would not mind killing
one-third of a nation if this ensured the security of the other
two-thirds.
   ``I want to kill only 1 percent of (Egypt's) population,'' Badr
was quoted as saying. This would mean about half a million people,
apparently Badr's estimate of fundamentalist strength.
   Islamic militancy has been a leading cause of domestic unrest
since even before the country became a republic in 1952.

   Alyssa Smith, the nation's first living-donor

   A farewell celebration and news conference were planned at the
University of Chicago's Wyler Children's Hospital Medical Center
for 23-month-old Alyssa and Teresa Smith, 29, who donated part of
her liver to her daughter on Nov. 27.
   Alyssa was released from the hospital on Monday and has been
staying with her mother at a nearby residence for the families of
out-of-town patients.
   Mrs. Smith and her daughter were scheduled to leave O'Hare
International Airport for their home in the San Antonio, Texas,
suburb of Schertz.
   ``I'm looking forward to getting back to normal _ even going
back to work,'' Mrs. Smith, a schoolteacher, told reporters
Thursday.
   The mother said she appreciated everything people did for her
daughter, but it may have been too much. ``We hope to get Alyssa
back to an unspoiled state, so we can live with her for the next 20
years,'' she said.
   Alyssa suffered from biliary atresia, a congenital disorder
which would have been fatal if she hadn't undergone a transplant,
doctors said.
   Alyssa would have to return to Chicago for checkups, said
hospital spokeswoman Mary Fetsch. At home, the child will continue
take drugs to prevent her body from rejecting the new organ, Ms.
Fetsch said.

   Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier of
Czechoslovakia on Thursday asked for the elimination of all
barriers with Poland as cooperation between the non-communist
governments of the two countries intensified.
   He told a news conference Solidarity Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki will visit Prague later this month and Vaclav Havel, the
newly elected president of Czechoslovakia, will visit Warsaw soon
after.
   ``We should turn away from the formalism which dominated our
relations in the past. There is a political necessity to eliminate
all barriers,'' Dienstbier said.
   Dienstbier met with Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski,
Mazowiecki and President Wojciech Jaruzelski. He placed flowers at
the grave of Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, a pro-Solidarity priest
murdered by security police in 1984.
   Skubiszewski told Dienstbier their meeting represented an
important moment in the history of the two countries. ``We
associate great hopes both with the new authorities of
Czechoslovakia and with you as a minister,'' he said.
   Dienstbier said he discussed improvement of economic ties,
relaxation of travel regulations between the two countries, and
environmental pollution.
   He said Czechoslovak and Polish economic experts will gather in
Prague next week to work out ways to improve economic cooperation.
   Dienstbier, sworn in Dec. 10 as a member of the first
non-communist government in Czechoslovakia in 41 years, arrived in
Warsaw on Wednesday.
   Poland's first non-communist government since World War II was
approved by parliament on Sept. 12.
   Dientsbier, Havel and other activists from Charter 77, the main
human rights group in Czechoslovakia, and members of the now
disbanded Polish Committee for the Defense of Workers or KOR, began
a tradition in 1978 of meeting along the border between the two
countries.
   Dienstbier evoked that tradition as one element which allowed
both nations to remove the authoritarian system that dominated all
forms of public and political life for over four decades.
   A proposal to form a confederation between Czechoslovakia and
Poland was discussed but Dienstbier said his government was
interested in the fastest possible building of one Europe and not
in creating new political blocs.
   In Prague, the state CTK news agency said Thursday a group of
Czechoslovak historians asked parliament speaker Alexander Dubcek
to investigate alleged preparations for communist military
intervention against Poland in 198O.
   Dubcek, elected parliament speaker on Dec. 28, 1989, led the
``Prague Spring'' Communist reforms in Czechoslovakia that were
crushed by a Soviet-led invasion of five Warsaw Pact countries in
August 1968.

   New Jersey environmental officials Thursday
asked the state attorney general to sue Exxon Corp. for spilling
more than a half million gallons of fuel in a waterway separating
New York and New Jersey.
   The request came a day after New York gave the oil giant until
Friday evening to admit liability for cleanup and damages to the
environment of the Arthur Kill between New Jersey and Staten
Island, or face legal action.
   Also Thursday, Exxon officials retreated from earlier claims
that a faulty alarm system in its underwater pipeline was
responsible for the magnitude of the Jan. 2 leak.
   The New Jersey lawsuit would charge Exxon with violating the
Clean Water Control Act and the New Jersey Spill Act. The DEP also
requested that Attorney General Peter Perretti consider suing Exxon
to recover state money spent on the cleanup and for damage to the
environment, department spokesman John Hagerty said.
   ``Exxon was not forthcoming or candid or timely in very basic
questions that the DEP had, questions such as `How much?' and
`How?''' Hagerty said. ``It took them close to a week to come up
with very basic answers to our primary questions.
   ``New Jersey's response to those answers was to ask the attorney
general to file a lawsuit.''
   A spokesman for the attorney general said Perretti had received
the DEP's request and could make a decision Friday.
   Exxon spokesman Bill Young said the company would not comment on
the DEP's requested lawsuit, nor on the threatened lawsuit by New
York Attorney General Robert Abrams.
   Abrams likened the waterway separating New York and New Jersey
to a ``mini-Alaska,'' referring to the Exxon Valdez spill of 11
million gallons of crude oil off that state's coast.
   ``It is imperative that Exxon immediately accept its liability
not only to clean up its spill, but also to fully compensate the
state financially for the damage to New York State's natural
resources which has and will occur,'' Abrams wrote in a letter to
Exxon president Lee. R. Raymond.
   If by Friday evening Exxon does not agree to pay for a study to
determine the damage and to restore natural resources, New York
will file suit in federal court, Abrams said.
   When the leak was discovered, the Coast Guard, using information
provided by Exxon, estimated the spill at only 5,000 gallons. That
has since been revised to 567,000 gallons.
   Exxon officials originally blamed a faulty leak-detection alarm
for allowing so much oil to spill, saying workers did not
investigate the alarm thoroughly because it had been issuing wrong
signals for a year. They revised that Tuesday, saying the device
was oversensitive, but not faulty.
   On Thursday, Exxon said the press misunderstood both
explanations, and that company attorneys advised the company not to
comment further.
   ``All we have to say is that workers responded to the
leak-detection system,'' Young said. ``We're not going to say
anything more about it.''

   Lt. Gen. Carl Stiner, the leader of the
U.S. invasion in Panama, is expected to be among the 2,000 soldiers
coming home in a mass parachute drop Friday, military officials
said.
   The jump time for the Fort Bragg paratroopers expected to return
on Friday from Panama was pushed up to 8 a.m. from the original 10
a.m. time, post officials said Thursday.
   The mass drop is expected to involve 20 planes from four Air
Force bases.
   Winds of 20 to 25 forecast for the morning could force
cancellation of the jump, and shift the troops' arrival to Pope Air
Force Base.
   The troops were involved in the Dec. 20 invasion of Panama that
toppled Panamanian dictator Gen. Manuel Noreiga.
   Among those expected to be on hand for the jump are Gen. Carl E.
Vuono, the Army chief of staff; Gen. Edwin H. Burba Jr., Forces
Command commander; and U.S. Rep. Charles G. Rose III, D-N.C.

   An Environmental Protection Agency review of
toxic industrial releases is reviving concerns that persons who
live near scores of chemical or industrial plants may be exposed to
high cancer risks.
   The EPA, in providing toxic chemical release data for nearly 150
industrial plants in 34 states, cautioned it should not be
considered a clear measure of actual cancer risk because it
reflects a worst-case level of exposure over a lifetime.
   But the findings caused the agency to pursue field checks at
some of the plants with the highest release levels and prompted
discussions with industry executives _ including some operators of
the plants involved _ about voluntary cuts in toxic emissions,
according to EPA officials.
   The EPA also indicated it is considering enforcement action
against some of the worst polluters, although no targets of such an
action were disclosed.

   Like an immense gravitational magnet, a
vast celestial structure nicknamed ``the great attractor'' is
pulling powerfully at the Milky Way and more than 100 other
galaxies, causing a dramatic distortion in the normal expansion of
the nearby universe.
   The structure has been shown in new studies to be pulling on
galaxies from across more than 100 million light years of space,
astronomer Alan Dressler said Thursday at a meeting of the American
Astronomical Society.
   Dressler, with the Carnegie Institution of Washington, said he
and Sandra Faber of the University of California at Santa Cruz have
confirmed the influence of the great attractor by measuring the
movements of about 400 galaxies and comparing that motion with what
is considered normal for an expanding universe.
   More than 100 galaxies were found to have a ``peculiar motion''
that pointed toward the center of what Dressler labeled the great
attractor.

   The air-driven artificial heart failed as a
permanent device but, scientists report, work continues on a new
generation of plastic hearts that would let patients live
independent of external machines.
   Some researchers say the Food and Drug Administration's
withdrawal of approval for the Jarvik-7 device might hurt their
work by creating doubt about the long-term feasibility of
artificial hearts.
   They agree that the future of artificial hearts lies in totally
transplantable devices, such as battery-run devices that also could
use external energy sources.
   Some day, a patient's plastic heart may beat from current
flowing from his car's cigarette lighter, says Dr. Donald Olsen, a

   Nine months after a ruling required states
to tax federal pensions the same as other public pensions, few
retired federal pensioners have collected their back taxes, but
states fear losing millions in revenues.
   An Associated Press survey shows that only eight of the 24
states affected by the ruling have agreed to give federal retirees
the same tax break on their pensions that state retirees have
enjoyed.
   The remaining 16 have yet to act or chose to give all public
retirees a minimal exemption rather than lose revenue by exempting
federal pensions. At least 17 states are being sued over the issue.
   A chain reaction of legal and fiscal snarls has grown out of the
lawsuit brought by Paul S. Davis, a retired attorney with the
Securities and Exchange Commission who lives in East Lansing.

<HEAD>India's Government Seeks to Loosen Controls on Radio and TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIJAY JOSHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh, following up
on a campaign promise, is preparing to loosen state controls on
television and radio and end what critics called blatant government
propaganda.
   Since Singh took office Dec. 2, the nightly TV news has been
showing the prime minister only about twice a week _ in sharp
contrast to the lavish daily coverage accorded his predecessor,
Rajiv Gandhi.
   Singh's government has introduced legislation in Parliament to
set up a corporation for the state-owned radio and television
stations, to be headed by a chairman immune to government
interference. The chairman would be chosen from a list of three
prospects submitted by a group made up of top government officials
and people involved in the arts and culture.
   The television network, which was expanded to reach 75 percent
of India's 880 million people during Gandhi's five years in office,
has been controlled by the government since its debut in 1965. All
India Radio, since its founding in 1927, has been under similar
constraints, by British colonial administrators for the first 20
years and then by the government of independent India.
   Under Gandhi, unabashedly pro-government programming reached a
zenith on the Doordarshan TV network. Gandhi's close aides dictated
editorial content over hotlines to TV officials and barked orders
to cameramen accompanying the prime minister.
   Gandhi had to appear every day on the screen ``one way or the
other,'' said one reporter, speaking only on condition of anonymity
out of fear the new legislation might fail. ``If he had no public
engagements, he would be shown meeting delegations at his house.''
   Just before the November elections, another reporter said, a
proposal by Gandhi to transfer more power to village levels was
given 12 minutes on the 20-minute evening news program.
   ``Take away five minutes for the headlines, the signature tune
and the weather forecast, and we were left with only three minutes
for genuine Indian news,'' he said.
   Such instances were the rule, said George Verghese, a media
expert who was instrumental in framing the new legislation for
Doordarshan, which means ``seeing from afar'' in Hindi.
   But now with Gandhi's Congress Party in the opposition, the
``Rajiv-darshan (seeing Rajiv) era is over and the new government
is briskly undoing the damage,'' said independent magazine Sunday.
   ``It was the biggest media heist in history. The country's sole
television network hijacked by a handful of politically motivated
bureaucrats, entire ranks of Doordarshan officials turned into
unresisting yes-men and a heavy dose of programs aimed at
controlling the minds of millions of Indians.''
   Doordarshan started operations in New Delhi in 1965 with
black-and-white broadcasts. The network expanded to other cities in
1972, adding to the country's rapid progress in technology. Color
broadcasts started in 1982.
   Media watchers have concentrated on television in demanding
autonomy for the media because of Doordarshan's omnipotence. Its
500 transmitters can reach about 660 million people and 55 percent
of the land area through 21 million television sets.
   Most Indians are too poor to buy even black-and-white television
sets that cost the equivalent in rupeesa of about $250. But
government-owned community television sets are found in almost
every village and draw large crowds.
   The broadcasting autonomy proposed by Singh's National Front
government has sparked debate. Many have welcomed the move, but the
Congress Party says autonomy will be meaningless if the corporation
continues to be funded by the government.
   The proposed legislation provides for complete financial aid by
the government to the corporation.
   Parvathaneni Upendra, the information and broadcasting minister,
has said privatization of radio and television would lead to a
different kind of control.
   ``We are not going to throw it to the wolves, nor are we going
to ask it to fend for itself,'' Sunday magazine quoted him as
saying in an interview. ``If we do that, big business or big
industry will try to capture it. We cannot allow that.''
   The bill is likely to become law by next Jan. 1. As an interim
measure, the government plans to set up a five-member board to
oversee the functioning of the two networks.
   ``But even now we are not going all-out in attacking the ruling
politicians,'' one of the Doordarshan reporters said. ``We will
sniff before every step until autonomy is actually achieved.''

<HEAD>Beasties of the World Unite: Fans of Canceled Show Refuse to Let
It Die</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The news trickled down into the dim underground
vaults and arcades where fans of ``Beauty and the Beast'' kept
alive the darkly atmospheric CBS romance-adventure series: Finally,
the show had been canceled.
   ``I think everybody is relieved. We don't have to worry about
CBS any more,'' said Stephanie Wiltse, publisher of Pipeline, a
definitive newsletter on the real-world workings of ``Beauty and
the Beast.''
   This is not to say that fans (who call themselves ``Beasties''
and ``Beast-friends'' or just ``Supporters of `Beauty and the
Beast''') will let the series die.
   No, when word leaked early this month that CBS had canceled the
show, fandom began to deluge Fox Broadcasting Co. with calls asking
it to pick up the show.
   ``Now that CBS has canceled `B&amp;B' outright and made it painfully
clear that they want nothing more to do with it, the fans are
saying, `OK, everybody, write to Fox,''' said Kimberly Hartman.
   Ms. Hartman founded of Helper's Network, a information
clearinghouse on the show for the roughly 50 fan clubs and 100 fan
periodicals that have sprung up in North America and Europe since
``B&amp;B'' made its debut in 1987.
   Fox's response, Ms. Hartman said, was that ``We don't have any
specific plans right now, but the door is open.''
   In a prepared statement last week, Fox was not quite that
optimistic. Referring to rumors it and the show's producers had
been discussing a pickup of the series, Fox said this:
   ``We don't know how the rumors got started. There've been no
discussions between the two parties, and at this point there is no
plan for Fox to pick up the show.''
   There also was speculation that cable's USA Network might pick
up the series and keep it going. But USA ``hasn't had any
discussions'' about that with the producers, says USA spokeswoman
Mary Lou O'Callaghan.
   And, she says, with the show costing $1 million an episode,
``it's not very likely'' that the USA Network would want to keep it
in production.
   ``Beauty and the Beast'' began as a love story between
Catherine, a New York City prosecutor, and Vincent, a literary,
leonine half-man who inhabits the city's subterranean world with a
like-minded community of outcasts.
   Critics applauded the show's themes of responsibility and human
kindness, as well as its artistic and production values. But they
also noted that a Shakespeare-quoting man-beast might not be
everyone's cup of tea.
   Low ratings plagued the Witt Thomas production from the start,
despite its winning five Emmy awards in two years. It couldn't find
a mass audience, but it fired the imaginations of people who
previously had no use for mainstream TV.
   ``I think in the very beginning we looked at it and thought,
`This is too beautiful to survive,''' Ms. Hartman said.
   Fans were more than just enthusiastic: They were intensely,
emotionally bound to the series, something unseen in TV since
``Star Trek'' fans took a moribund science fiction series that
ended in September 1969 and created a pop artifact that has spawned
five feature films and yet another series.
   ``It's a very archetypal show,'' Ms. Hartman said, noting that
the basic theme of the show is a few thousand years old. Even when
Catherine was killed off and the romance theme was subordinated to
crime-busting action, fans still loved the show's writing, music,
acting and willingness to tackle tough issues.
   Ms. Wiltse, an Albany, N.Y., graphic designer who's seen her
life and livelihood gradually become a 1,550-subscriber newsletter
and full-time work on ``Beauty and the Beast'' projects, agrees
about the show's appeal.
   ``People can watch `B&amp;B' and see themselves reflected in it,''
she said.
   Its stories about grief, loneliness and loss tend to touch
people intimately, she said. ``They take it very personally and
they take that feeling out into the world.''
   ``That feeling'' also has inspired many fan clubs to get
involved with local charities, especially those for the homeless,
the abused and the outcast. Right now, though, Beast-friends want
their show to survive, said Debi Tolleson, president of
Jacksonville (Fla.) Supporters of Beauty and the Beast.
   ``We've started writing telegrams and letters and phone calls to
the folks at Fox,'' she said. ``The general feeling is that because
Fox is innovative and ... more apt to listen to their viewers than
be strictly under control by the Nielsens, that we might do better
there,'' she said.
   ``We even want a feature film one of these days.''
   Ms. Wiltse allows herself to hope for a happy ending. When
interviewed recently, she said she'd been taking calls for two days
and two nights from concerned fans. ``These people aren't going to
let this thing die. One way or another, it will be with them.''

<HEAD>Here's The Corporate ``Misgiving'' List</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The annual corporate misgivers list is being
readied for publication and, as expected, it will show that
American companies have a tendency to support their ideological
opponents.
   Each company on the list, says the Capital Research Center,
``has been singled out for outstanding contributions to
anti-business lobbying and advocacy groups.''
   In the past, however, such corporate giving has been defended as
being in the spirit of democracy, and that no better commitment to
it could be made than to support pluralistic opinions, the better
to clarify issues.
   The list includes some of the big names in industry, beginning
with Primerica Corp., of Greenwich, Conn., followed by Dayton
Hudson Corp. and General Mills Inc. of Minneapolis and New
York-based American Express Co. and Mobil Oil Corp.
   Primerica was assigned a 2.9 ranking, the ``worst'' for any
company, based on a scale of one to nine. The lowest reading, a
one, is said to be ``radical left,'' a five supposedly is center
and a nine is ``radical right.''
   Cited among Primerica's donations was one to the NOW-Legal
Defense and Education Fund, an organization the center states has
inititated lawsuits to prevent the use of actuarial tables in
determining insurance rates.
   The fund, assigned the rank of two, claims support from ``more
than 150 corporations and institutions'' for its work. Among its
other contributors were American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., Capital
Cities-ABC Inc., Merck &amp; Co. Inc., Chemical Banking Corp., Xerox
Corp. and American Express.
   General Motors Corp., 4.4, contributed to the National Wildlife
Federation, 3.3, which the center described as ``an organization
which seeks tougher (and perhaps unattainable) automobile emissions
standards.''
   Pillsbury Co., 3, and Archer Daniels Midland Co., 4.1, both
heavily dependent on the agricultural industry, contributed to the
American Farmlands Trust, 3, ``a group which advocates centralized
control of American farms.''
   The largest corporate grant the center lists as having been
received by the World Wildlife Fund, ranked 4-3 or ``center-left,
liberal,'' came from Exxon Corp., 3.6, a company involved in major
wildlife disasters in the past year.
   The research center, a not-for-profit, Washingtonbased
organization that receives most of its funds from foundations and
industry, knows that its list is controversial and that it would be
ranked nine by many of those named.
   But, says Willa Ann Johnson, its chairman, ``we bent over
backward to be fair and if someone wants to challenge us we can put
up a defense.''
   The lists are contained in ``Patterns of Corporate
Philanthropy,'' a 320-page volume compiled by James Bennett, George
Mason University economics professor, with a preface by Robert
Malott, chairman of FMC Corp.
   FMC is ranked 6.1, just below SmithKline Beckman Corp. (now
SmithKline Beecham PLC), 6.4, at the top of the list, and just
ahead of Eastman Kodak Co., 5.8, Amoco Corp., 5.6, and Procter &amp;
Gamble Co., 5.3.
   In his preface, Malott observes that corporate support for
public affairs research organizations listed in the book amounted
to $26.3 million in 1987, the latest year for which data was
available.
   Of this sum, he says, $16.2 million, about 61.6 percent, went to
organizations that ``can be classified as left-of-center.'' Only
$8.64 million, less than 33 percent, went to right-of-center groups.
   ``Overall, for every $1 given to right-of-center groups, $1.87
went to support left-of-center causes,'' he states.
   Asked why this was so, Ms. Johnson gave four possible reasons.
First, she said, not enough thought is given to the matter by chief
executives. Secondly, corporate directors appear not to be involved
in the giving process.
   She cited ``short-term or short-sighted'' thinking as another
reason, while conceding that some donations might be made in an
effort to seek cooperation from the recipient.
   Finally, she said, a ``self-selection process'' is at work in
the corporate areas responsible for financial grants. Asked to
explain, she said those who tend to seek such jobs are inclined
toward personal rankings lower than 5.
   The volume, scheduled for publication January 29, is available
for $50, plus $3 postage and handling, from the Capital Research
Center, 1612 K Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20006.

   Quake-related calls to suicide hotlines have dropped to a
fraction after three months, but unsettling reminders of the
earth's fury remain. A shopping mall in a seaside town resembles an
abandoned movie set, hundreds of people are still homeless and
major sections of freeways are still closed or detoured.
   Aftershocks have subsided since the earthquake of 7.1 magnitude
shook Northern California on Oct. 17, but the recovery efforts
expected to take years are apparent as hammering and the hum of
heavy construction equipment fill the air from San Francisco and
downtown Oakland to Watsonville.
   The 15-second temblor injured 2,500 people, killed 67 and left
10,000 homeless; $7 billion damage made it the nation's costliest
quake ever. Almost 70,000 claims have been filed with the Federal
Emergency Management Agency in the San Francisco Bay area for
temporary housing help, home and business loans, grants and other
aid. The American Red Cross says 14,000 families probably will have
received temporary shelter, clothes, blankets, food and other help.
   The eyes of sports fans across the country were on Candlestick
Park and a World Series game between the San Francisco Giants and
the Oakland A's when the quake hit. The ballpark was in the
limelight again this weekend as the 49ers played the Los Angeles
Rams in hopes of a Super Bowl berth.
   ``Life is not as anxious as it was for anyone, but it isn't the
same for anyone ... It'll never be the same again,'' said Eve
Meyer, executive director of the San Francisco Suicide Prevention
Hotline, which saw quake-related calls drop from a peak of about
200 a day to the current average two a day.
   ``They say in about six months, it'll be back to normal and
everyone will forget all about it,'' said Erik Carlson, of Mahopac,
N.Y. The quake damaged his spine and left him paralyzed from the
waist down in the wreckage of the collapsed Cypress section of the
Nimitz Freeway in Oakland.
   ``How could I? Look at what it did to my body,'' he said.
   And while Watsonville's Fox Theater marquee wishes passers-by
``Happy New Year'' in English and Spanish, that prospect remains
dubious for many of the estimated 1,000 people left homeless in the
agricultural community 70 miles south of San Francisco.
   Maria Alvarez and her husband slept in a parking lot with their
five children and several other families for four nights after the
quake. Now they have a trailer supplied by the federal government
for 18 months. But after that, she doesn't know if they can afford
to rent a new home.
   ``I've been living here for about 30 years. Now to move
somewhere else, I wouldn't feel right. To start again, it's hard to
do,'' Alvarez said, standing in the 40-trailer Crestview camp, one
of a half-dozen in the Watsonville area.
   ``At least they're secure now,'' said Mayor Todd Mc Farren.
``But they have a lot of fears about what's going to happen in 18
months ... and I don't have an answer for them.''
   Mc Farren expressed concern for the future of the city that
sustained $60 million in damage and lost $400,000 in sales tax and
$200,000 in property tax. ``A lot of workers have left town and the
canneries are concerned they won't come back in the spring ... the
word's out there's no place left to live.''
   The once quaint and tranquil Pacific Garden Mall is the focal
point for damage in neighboring Santa Cruz, 60 miles from San
Francisco near the quake's Loma Prieta epicenter. Today, it
resembles an abandoned movie set or a ghost town. Most of the
buildings _ with broken windows, chipped walls and tilted frames _
are fenced off. Others have been demolished, leaving huge holes.
   Around the mall's fringe are vinyl ``pods'' where 45 businesses
have set up temporary shop, for what may be a two-year stay. One
shop displayed leftover holiday T-shirts proclaiming, ``Yes,
Virginia, there IS a Santa Cruz.''
   In San Francisco's Marina District, near the Golden Gate Bridge,
``For Rent'' signs _ some vouching for the safety of the premises _
fill apartment windows, and vacant lots abound where buildings were
torn down. The Embarcadero Freeway, once a key entrance to the
waterfront and Chinatown, is closed. Its future is uncertain as
officials debate environmental, economic and public safety
implications of its repair.
   A survey by the San Francisco Economic Development Corp. shows
the city's $3.4 billion tourism industry has been hard hit. The
number of spouses coming with conventioneers and the number of
leisure travelers _ who account for half of all visitors from
outside the region _ is down a third from a year ago.
   It's been hard to convince outsiders the city is safe, that
``this isn't Soviet Armenia,'' said San Francisco Visitors and
Convention Bureau spokeswoman Sharon Rooney. ``We've proven we can
rebound from that _ the cable cars were running within 48 hours
after the earthquake.
   ``We're a city probably better prepared than any other city for
an earthquake.''
   Across the bay in Oakland, where the Cypress section of the
Nimitz Freeway crumpled like a paper fan and killed 42 people, all
but a small portion of the roadway has been demolished. A 1\-mile
swath, like a glaring scar, divides the heavily damaged downtown
and a neighborhood ravaged by drug-related violence.
   City Hall has been vacated as authorities consider spending an
estimated $40 million to $50 million for repairs, and a major
department store long vital to a struggling economy faces $8
million to $10 million in renovation bills.
   In addition, Alameda County needs $20 million to keep homeless
shelters open and up to $100 million to repair residential hotels
closed by the quake, said county supervisors' Chairman Don Perata.
   Erik Carlson, for one, will never be convinced of the region's
safety. ``I would come back, but I wouldn't stay long,'' he said
shortly before leaving to return to New York. ``Live in California?
Out! Completely! No way!''

   You know the voice of the grown-up Kevin
Arnold on ABC's ``The Wonder Years,'' but you probably don't know
the man behind the voice is actor-director Daniel Stern.
   Stern gets no regular screen credit for the narration, and when
he auditioned he was known only as ``No. 6.'' His name does appear
when he directs an episode of the hit comedy that focuses on Kevin
as a 13-year-old in the 1960s. He's directed seven so far.
   ``I'd never done voiceover before so I've had to learn as I went
along,'' said Stern. ``I like my part. There's a lot of emotions
and conflict to be acted out. I think it's good that the narrator
is an adult. It wouldn't be as effective if the narrator was
Kevin's age. It's a good device that helps pull the stories
together.''
   Stern provides the ironic footnotes for ``The Wonder Years,''
which won an Emmy as best comedy series in 1988 after its premiere
that January. Fred Savage stars as 13-year-old Kevin.
   The show wouldn't be nearly as funny, nor as poignant, without
the acerbic comments from Stern.
   He's never appeared in the show. ``I almost did once,'' he said,
``but I don't want to do that. I don't want to goof around with it.
The show means something to a lot of people. You don't want it to
be too in or too jokey.''
   Only once has his name been listed as narrator. That came when
he directed his first episode, called ``Pottery Will Get You
Nowhere.'' It was about a year ago, in the second season.
   ``I did it for my mother,'' he said. ``I think it works out
better not to have my name listed.''
   His brother, David Stern, was the original story consultant for
``The Wonder Years,'' but has since left.
   ``At the time I was auditioning for the show I got my brother a
job as a production assistant on `Born in East L.A.,''' he said.
``I played a great sleazy character. I showed David a copy of the
pilot script and he wrote a script on speculation. They hired him
as a staff writer.''
   Stern has played sleazy characters in other movie roles. In
``Leviathan,'' he was a diver and crew member whose morals were
also at the bottom of the ocean. Despite the numerous underwater
sequences, he said he never got his feet wet. Instead of water,
they made their way through smoke tinted by colored lights to look
like water. Special air vents on their boots blew sand on the floor
so that it appeared to be washed about.
   Stern mostly acts in feature motion pictures, such as ``Diner,''
``Hannah and Her Sisters,'' ``Blue Thunder,'' ``The Milagro
Beanfield War'' and ``One-Trick Pony.'' His only television series
was ``Hometown'' on CBS five years ago.
   He'd hoped to reprise his character of Shrevie from ``Diner''
for Barry Levinson's latest movie, ``Avalon,'' but the one-day role
had to be filmed on Thanksgiving Day on location in Baltimore.
Stern had 10 relatives coming for Thanksgiving dinner and had to
turn it down.
   ``When I was hired to narrate I said I'd like to direct,'' he
said. ``I went to the set and met everyone. I observed Steve Miner
direct the pilot. He sort of invented the style and directed a lot
of the shows the first season.
   ``I feel comfortable directing. I've been in about 30 movies and
the last 15 I've kept my eyes open to the process, as opposed to
just sitting in my trailer when I wasn't needed. I took a role in
`My Blue Heaven' just to watch Herbert Ross work. I did that with
Sidney Lumet and `Daniel' and Woody Allen and `Hannah and Her
Sisters' and `Stardust Memories.'''
   His newest movie is ``Coupe De Ville,'' due in March, about
three brothers who take an old car across country.
   ``They sort of get to know each other on the trip,'' Stern said.
``I was in that car forever. I do all the driving.''
   Stern lived for 12 years in New York before moving to Los
Angeles. He and his wife have three children.

<HEAD>Breaks Appearing In Church Bans Against Ordaining Active
Homosexuals</HEAD>
<NOTE>With Laserphoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Sporadic breaks are occurring in the longtime church positions
against ordaining acknowledged, active homosexuals. They're gaining
their first footholds in the historic Christian ministry.
   It's happening in isolated instances despite denominational
policies and protests.
   In the past, there have been ordinations of some who affirm only
homosexual orientation, but the new cases involve not just that
orientation, but latitude to practice it.
   ``It's a historic breakthrough, a new step,'' said the Rev. John
Frykman, pastor of First United Lutheran Church in San Francisco,
concerning three scheduled Lutheran ordinations there next week.
   In another case, Episcopal Bishop John Spong of Newark, N.J.,
said his ordination last month of a gay man with an acknowleged
male mate was ``a step into honesty and integrity'' for the church.
   Never before, the record indicates, had anyone professedly in a
homosexual relationship been ordained into the mainline Christian
ministry, although some already ordained have later told of
homosexual partners.
   Studies indicate there are many ``closet'' homosexual ministers,
some sexually active, in the historic churches, Protestant and
Roman Catholic. Also ordination of those acknowledging only
homosexual orientation is frequent.
   But major denominations have drawn the line against ordaining
ostensibly active homosexuals. That is the barrier challenged in
the Lutheran ordinations in San Francisco next Saturday, Jan. 20.
   Two congregations of the 5.3-million-member Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America are ordaining an openly committed lesbian couple
and a male homosexual who declines to vow abstinence from
homosexual activity.
   ``It means fuller acceptance of them,'' said the Rev. James
Delange, pastor of St. Francis Lutheran Church in San Francisco,
where the three will be a pastoral team leading a new ministry to
lesbians and gays.
   ``We're saying that homosexuals are to be welcomed into the
church in the fullest sense of the word, that their relationships
are to be honored and respected,'' Delange added.
   Delange, 55, said gays make up about half his centrally located
congregration, where the lesbian couple, Ruth Frost and Phyllis
Zillhart of Minneapolis, and gay man, Jeff Johnson of San
Francisco, will serve.
   Johnson's ordination, however, was authorized by the First
United Lutheran congregation in the city's western part. Pastor
Frkyman, 58, said it has no known gay members, but supports ``more
acceptance'' of them.
   Both congregations risk penalties, ranging from censure to
expulsion from it the denomination, for defying church law.
   Frykman, a pastor for 30 years, said, ``It wouldn't be the
easiest thing to be driven out of the church. I've given my life
for the church. But in this situation, the church hierarchy is
acting against gospel principle.''
   Synod Bishop Lyle Miller foresaw calling a disciplinary
committee about the matter. Denominational policy, like that of
most major Protestant bodies, bars ordination of acknowledged
active homosexuals.
   However, some denominations have no explicit, national rule
about it, notably the United Church of Christ, which leaves it up
to regional units. They've ordained 10 acknowledged homosexuals
since 1980.
   Regarding their behavior patterns, ``that information was
neither asked nor given,'' says denominational news officer Evan
Golder.
   This also was the case when that church, stemming from early
American pilgrims, ordained this country's first publicly
identified homosexual minister, the Rev. William R. Johnson of San
Carlos, Calif., in 1972.
   Many church people feel ``sexual orientation is not a moral
issue,'' Golder said, but that ``sex behavior is of moral
significance.''
   When complaints were lodged in 1986 against a United Methodist
acknowledged homosexual, the Rev. Julian Rush of Denver, he simply
refused to answer questions about sexual activity, thus not overtly
outside church rules.
   The behavioral factor also was not specified in 1977 when New
York's then Episcopal Bishop Paul Moore ordained the Rev. Ellen
Barrett, an acknowledged lesbian, into the Episcopal priesthood.
   But it was specified in the Episcopal ordination last Dec. 16 of
the Rev. J. Robert Williams to direct Oasis, a Hoboken, N.J.,
ministry to homosexuals. His male mate read the litany as picketers
protested.
   That 3-million-member denomination like the Lutheran body and
other major denominations, the United Methodist Church and
Presbyterian Church (USA), have policies against ordaining
acknowledged active homosexuals.
   Those denominations are pursuing extensive sexualty studies.
Episcopal Presiding Bishop Edmond L. Browning said he hopes the
Williams ordination ``will encourage positive debate, rather than
polarization.''
   While ordaining professedly active homosexuals oversteps
mainline church policies, it now is formally accepted in the
Unitarian Universalist Association, which doesn't identify itself
as Christian.
   That 173,000-member, liberal body ordained its first
acknowledged homosexual in 1979 and now has about 50 of them among
950 clergy, says the Rev. Scott Alexander of Boston, its director
of gay-lesbian concerns.
   ``Many live with partners,'' he said. ``It's part of human
wholeness.''
   Such arrangements also are fully accepted in another relatively
small group, the Metropolitan Community Churches, organized
particularly for homosexuals in 1968, now with about 34,000 members.

   Leaders of 10 Protestant denominations urge an
end to polarization and sloganeering about abortion, terming it a
complex moral issue that can't be reduced to ``simple rights and
wrongs, pros and cons.''
   In a joint statement initiated by Episcopal Presiding Bishop
Edmond L. Browning, the church leaders said discussion of abortion
should ``encourage sensitive listening to those on all sides'' of
the issue.
   ``We as religious leaders have the insights to offer from our
various faith traditions about both the sacredness of life and the
importance of informed personal conscience that have come out of
years of prayer, study and debate,'' they said.
   Although the signers hold differing views of abortion, they said
they were united in a ``deep and abiding reverence for both the
mystery of human life and the freedom of human conscience''
grounded in the nurture of churches.

   Is it possible for a TV series to be too clever
for its own good?
   That's the question some British critics have been asking about
Frederic Raphael's ``After the War,'' the 10-hour miniseries from
Granada TV that began Jan. 7 on PBS in the United States.
   The $15 million show spans the years 1942-67 in the life of
Michael Jordan, an English Jew first glimpsed at boarding school at
the age of 12 during World War II.
   He goes on to work as a journalist, playwright and documentary
filmmaker, all the while struggling to define his place in society
as an artist, a Briton and a Jew.
   Thirty-two-year-old English newcomer Adrian Lukis plays the
well-bred, well-heeled Michael, and Clare Higgins is his older
sister, Rachel.
   Robert Reynolds portrays Michael's longtime friend, Joe Hirsch,
a refugee from Nazi Germany. Anton Rodgers, Denis Quilley and
Susannah York head the supporting cast.
   The series examines attitudes towards life, love and politics in
the quarter century following World War II. But many British
observers thought the show's content secondary to form _ a
ceaseless supply of swift, sharp witticisms that exhilarated some
and left others cold.
   Christopher Dunkley in the Financial Times called the show
``entertaining, engrossing, often witty,'' and lauded its ``huge
cast of wonderful actors and actresses.''
   But Thomas Sutcliffe in the Independent lamented the
``self-consciously heightened'' quality of the writing. ``Much has
been written about Raphael's torrent of one-liners, but not enough
to prepare you for the real thing.''
   The 58-year-old Raphael explained his intentions in a telephone
interview from his home in southwest France.
   ``I like to be entertaining,'' he said. ``I like people to speak
with clarity and elegance and wit if possible, but constantly at
the service of reminding people of what is dark.
   ``I'd like to think not everybody (in the show) is witty in the
same way,'' said Raphael, whose six-part 1976 series, ``Glittering
Prizes,'' won acclaim in Britain and the United States.
   ``The point is that this series, and the novel that goes with
it, are fiction, and fictions are not extracted from life,'' he
said.
   ``If people want to hear dialogue as it is actually spoken, they
could take down our conversations and after a very short while,
they would fall asleep. ``I want them to wake up.''
   Raphael said criticisms that his characters could be obnoxious
missed the point about them.
   ``I daresay Michael's not very likable,'' he said. ``But I
distrust books and films in which people wink at the reader.''
   Raphael admired Lukis for refusing to make Michael a ``cutie.''
   ``He never tried to make him charming, or smile away his
surliness,'' he said.
   Born in Chicago, Raphael left the United States when he was 7
years old. He attended Cambridge University and wrote three
important films of the 1960s: ``Two for the Road'' (1966), with
Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney, ``Far From the Madding Crowd''
(1967) and ``Darling'' (1965), both with Julie Christie. He won an
Academy Award for ``Darling,'' which also garnered an Oscar for
Christie, and he was nominated for the prize with ``Two for the
Road.''
   And despite these three decidedly British vehicles, he said the
British misunderstand his sense of humor.
   ``I'm actually quite American,'' Raphael said in impeccably
accented British English. ``That's part of the reason my dialogue
is like it is. They (critics) all think it's a tribute to English
wit, but it's very much to do with a New York way of speaking.''
   Raphael considered ``After the War'' to be more like film than
routine television. He said it captures ``the essence of film
writing and filmmaking in the way of both collapsing time and
extending it: We cover virtually a quarter of a century.
Nevertheless, we do not hurry; we do not summarize.''
   ``After the War'' was made by the same company that backed
``Brideshead Revisited'' and ``The Jewel in the Crown,'' two other
elegantly produced, literate sagas of the 1980s.

   Wall Street isn't making things easy this year
for investors who want to take a cue from the stock market's
performance in early January.
   Since New Year's, the market has zigzagged through a pattern of
almost daily course changes, frustrating would-be bulls and bears
alike.
   In so doing, it has clouded the picture for anyone trying to
make sense of such traditional phenomena as the January barometer,
the January effect and the January ``early warning system.''
   The January barometer, popularized by investment adviser Yale
Hirsch, holds that the trend of stock prices in the first month
sets the tone for the rest of the year.
   Its final verdict won't be in for a while yet. To date, however,
it seems to have signaled only that ``stocks will fluctuate'' as
1990 passes.
   For those who can't bring themselves to sit on their hands until
Jan. 31, Hirsch also has published studies on a supposed
early-warning barometer that covers just the first five sessions of
the year.
   Over that span this month, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials gained 41.17 points, or 1.5 percent. But that advance
was more than wiped out in the next two trading days.
   This erratic behavior also has confounded many followers of the
so-called January effect, a historical tendency toward
better-than-normal performance in the first few weeks of the year
for the market in general, and small stocks in particular.
   Some observers think the January effect, with all the widespread
attention it gets these days, has fallen victim to its own press
clippings.
   Hirsch's monthly letter Smart Money has itself been urging
subscribers not to try to play it this time around, on the
rationale that ``if everyone knows about it, it isn't worth
knowing.''
   A good many analysts also aren't professing much dismay over the
absence of any decisive ``forecast'' so far from the traditional
January indicators.
   The early-warning system in particular, they say, has been
consistently inconsistent in its readings over the last few years.
   In 1989, according to calculations by William LeFevre at Advest
Inc., the Dow average rose 1.42 percent over the first five
sessions, correctly portending an up year. But the average was down
1.42 percent in the first week of 1988, which also wound up a
winner.
   In 1987, it rose 5.61 percent in the first week. By yearend, the
average's net gain had shrunk to 2.26 percent, rendering the
``accurate'' forecast useless for any practical purpose.
   The statistical evidence gives stronger support to the January
effect, which has been attributed to such influences as the
end-of-December tax selling when New Year's arrives.
   According to Joanne Hill and John Kilgannon, analysts at
PaineWebber Inc., January has indeed been the best month of the
year for total return _ dividends plus capital gains _ in the stock
market in the '80s and over the past 22 years.
   In the 22-year span, however, it produced positive results only
55 percent of the time. So even with its historical edge, Hill and
Kilgannon concluded, owning stocks in January ``is far from a sure
thing.''

   Her head lolled sideways like that of a rag doll,
dark hair dangling over a contorted, bloodied face. An emergency
breathing tube, useless, as it turned out, protruded from her mouth.
   Who would not believe the anguished story of Carol Stuart's
husband, who sat next to his pregnant wife, his shoulder cushioning
her head, his blood-splattered shirt torn wide to expose the bullet
hole in his belly?
   Chuck Stuart, teeth gritted with pain, had barely been able to
summon help on his car phone. ``My wife's been shot, I've been
shot. ... Oh, man, it hurts and my wife has stopped gurgling, she's
stopped breathing.''
   Even Carol Stuart's family never doubted his story that a black
gunman with a raspy voice had commandeered their car as they left a
hospital birthing class, then robbed and shot them.
   ``Never, never,'' said her brother, Carl DiMaiti. ``He seemed so
believable. There he was lying in a hospital with tubes and
intravenous and there'd never been any problem that anyone could
see between him and Carol. So why would anyone doubt him?''
   Now, 10 days after Stuart's terrible hoax was exposed with his
suicide leap off a bridge, authorities are sorting rumors and
evidence, both focusing on insurance money, looking for a motive in
Carol Stuart's murder and any partners in the plot.
   One of the most fascinating _ and repellent _ aspects of the
Stuart case is the family involvement. Two of Chuck's younger
brothers, who stood at Carol's wake and carried her casket, had
suspected for 2{ months their sister-in-law had been the victim of
a murder plot. A third brother, two half-sisters and their parents
learned of the crime in the days just before Chuck's suicide.
   In the first week of the new year, Matthew Stuart, 23, told his
attorney he'd suspected Chuck had killed his wife ever since the
Oct. 23 murder, although Matthew said he was not involved in the
shooting.
   On Friday, Richard Clayman, attorney for Michael Stuart, 27,
disclosed to reporters that Matthew told Michael about his
suspicions on Oct. 26.
   In addition, Clayman said, Chuck and Michael had a ``disjointed,
vague conversation'' some weeks before the murder, and Michael told
Chuck: ``I don't know exactly what you're talking about, but I'm
not getting involved with anything, any sort of crazy thing you're
talking about.''
   Under Massachusetts law, no one can be charged with a crime for
failing to report what they suspect, but all over Boston people are
saying that Matthew and Michael had a moral obligation to come
forward.
   ``If they did know and they sat with us and cried, then it is
the ultimate hypocrisy,'' said Carl DiMaiti.
   Details of the plot kept tumbling out last week. Stuart was the
beneficiary of at least two insurance policies on his wife totaling
$182,000, and authorities were said to be checking reports of at
least one other policy worth more than twice that amount. Reports
said Stuart needed the money to realize a dream of starting his own
restaurant but felt his wife and baby would be a hindrance.
   A nickel-plated .38-caliber revolver pulled Tuesday from the
Pines River in suburban Revere, where Chuck Stuart grew up, appears
to be the one stolen from the fur store he managed. Chuck and Carol
Stuart were shot with a .38-caliber gun, although it has not been
determined if the gun from the river was the weapon that shot
either of them. She was 30 when she died; he turned 30 two weeks
before his suicide.
   A grand jury convened Friday to investigate the evidence and
rumors still flying around Boston.
   Carl DiMaiti has heard them all: that some neighbors suspected
Chuck from the beginning, that he stayed out on Friday nights
because he was having an affair, that the couple was heard arguing
loudly.
   ``I would like one of them to come up to me and say (that). (I
would say) `Oh, really, do you think you knew her better or you saw
her more than her parents and her very close friends?'
   ``I hear she was upset because he went out on a Friday night. I
think that's a pretty common occurrence in marriages. Chuck was a
great sports fan. He was often at Celtics or Bruins games. I never
saw them arguing. They were a very loving couple. They did things
together. They went out to eat. They went to shows.''
   Much of the nation saw him that way, too, the suburbanite living
the middle-class American dream, victimized by city crime. People
were outraged by the images of a woman in her death throes, a woman
expecting her first child at Christmastime.
   ``I was shocked out of my mind,'' said Rosemary Leone, an aunt.
``I prayed that she didn't suffer.''
   But a tragedy that might have been treated as a routine urban
crime story took on another dimension because of a dramatic,
tape-recorded 10-minute exchange between the wounded Stuart and
state police dispatcher Gary McLaughlin, who pleaded with Stuart to
hang on until patrol cars could find him.
   ``You can't blank out on me, I need you, man. Chuck? Chuck?
Chuck, can you hear me? Chuck ... Chuck, pick up the phone, I can
hear you breathing there, Chuck, come on, buddy.''
   The drama, which tore at hearts around the world and brought
torrents of sympathy cards from as far away as Italy, remained
riveting for weeks. Stuart wrote a poignant letter that was read at
his wife's funeral. ``I will never again know the feeling of your
hand in mine, but I will always feel you,'' it read in part. ``I
miss you and I love you.''
   He asked forgiveness for her killer. ``For us to truly believe,
we must know that (God's) will was done and that there was some
right in this meanest of acts. In our souls, we must forgive this
sinner because he would, too.''
   Their baby, Christopher, died 17 days after his premature birth.
Stuart, hospitalized six weeks, left his bed to kiss his dying son
goodbye.
   Stuart's dark side now shadows living victims. His father,
Charles Sr., who has Parkinson's disease, and his mother, Dot, who
recently had a cancerous breast removed, apparently were told by
other children of Chuck's involvement in Carol's murder just two
days before his suicide.
   Chuck's mother and two sisters visited Giusto and Evelyn DiMaiti
three or four times in November and early December. Carl DiMaiti
recalled the Stuarts speaking fondly of his sister: ``You know,
what a lovely girl Carol was, how Chuck can never replace her, how
much they loved Carol, how special she was.''

<HEAD>Shadoe Stevens Plays `Loose Cannon' in TV Series</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It isn't entirely by chance that the series
created for Shadoe Stevens is about an unconventional police
detective, a ``Loose Cannon.''
   In the new CBS action-adventure series ``Max Monroe: Loose
Cannon,'' which replaced ``Snoops,'' Stevens stars as a police
officer who will do anything, no matter how wild, in the pursuit of
a criminal suspect.
   Drive a car through a restaurant window? No waiting for a table.
Turn and bark down a snarling Doberman? Arf! Arf!
   Like Max, Stevens is himself unconventional: unique,
exaggerated, offbeat, eccentric, radical. Did we say out of the
ordinary? Definitely.
   The relative newcomer to national television already has been
declared the newest hearthrob. The blond, ruggedly handsome Stevens
is a cult phenomenon. He was mobbed like a rock star when he taped
a regular appearance on ``Hollywood Squares'' in New York. He's an
internationally known radio personality through his ``American Top
40'' show, heard on 1,200 stations in 67 countries.
   Critics have called Stevens, who was born Terry Ingstad in
Jamestown, N.D., the ``male Vanna White.'' He turns that to his
advantage, declaring he really is Vanna White. ``I use a lot of
makeup.''
   His satirical TV commercials for the Federated Group, in which
he played Fred Rated, sent sales up 300 percent the first weekend.
During four years and 1,200 commercials Federated went from 14
electronics stores in Los Angeles to 70 stores in five states.
Three times, as a disc jockey and program director, he put rock
radio stations in first place in the Los Angeles market.
   Stevens talked about himself and his show while having his hair
shampooed and makeup applied on location at the just-closed Queen
of Angels Hospital.
   ``Max Monroe is a guy who will do whatever is necessary to get
the job done. He'll take his hands off the steering wheel at 110
miles an hour to scare a drug dealer. He'll get on the ground and
bark at a charging Doberman. That was the most terrifying thing
I've ever done. I knew the dog was trained, but still it was
frightening.
   ``Max is a fatalist. He's fearless. Yet, beneath it all he's not
psychotic. He's got a terrific sense of humor. He's seeking the joy
and fun in life. He's interested in everything. He's a master chess
player and a master of disguise.''
   No one wants to work with him, but on these kind of shows
there's always one guy who'll risk life and career. Bruce Young
plays Max's more conventional partner, Charlie Ivers. He also has a
boss who goes around pulling his hair and saying things like:
``Max, I'm warning you, I went on on a limb for you. One more time
and I'll have your badge!''
   ``Max Monroe'' has a stylish look, in the manner of ``Miami
Vice,'' and a sense of humor, in the manner of ``The Rockford
Files.'' When he sat down to brainstorm the series with producers
Fred Silverman and Dean Hargrove, Stevens mentioned those shows.
Like ``Miami Vice,'' it's also propelled along by contemporary
music _ selected by Stevens.
   Stevens got into radio at the age of 10 when he built a station
in his home in Jamestown. The signal could be heard only about a
mile, but station KEYJ signed him at 11 for his own Saturday
morning show.
   ``I've always been a rocker, although I have done classic,
rhythm and blues and bad middle of the road. I worked on a station
in Grand Forks while going to the University of North Dakota. In my
fourth year I transferred to the University of Arizona and studied
drama and journalism.
   ``After college I went to WRKO in Boston and for the first time
devoted myself with no diversions to becoming a radio personality.
I did well. I had the highest rating in the history of Boston. Then
I came to Los Angeles.''
   Stevens had a series of jobs in Los Angeles, but as program
director he made first KRLA, then KROQ and finally KMET the No. 1
stations.
   ``I loved what I was doing. I'm a fanatic for detail. I've
always approached everything with enthusiasm and I won't quit. I
came up with a very uplifting, high-energy, personality-driven,
theatrical approach to radio.''
   Stevens, who now does ``Max Monroe,'' ``Hollywood Squares,'' and
``American Top 40,'' said, ``I can't call doing a series work.
   ``Working on a railroad section gang like I did once is work.
But I tell you, at the end of a week I'm absolutely defused. The
only down side, keeping it from being bliss, is I don't get to see
my wife and daughter enough.''

   Nobody talks.
   In this tough working-class city, family and friends come first.
It's a matter of honor to guard secrets. So while family and
friends of Charles Stuart knew the awful truth or had their
suspicions, no one talked _ at least not to outsiders.
   Not the brother who hid evidence, including the alleged murder
weapon. Not the friend Stuart reportedly asked about arranging his
wife's death. Not the others in Stuart's hometown who gossiped for
weeks, adding to the buzz on the street that Chuckie did it.
   The police heard the buzz but couldn't crack the silence.
Reporters, who count on the human tendency to blab, couldn't pry
out the truth about Charles Stuart's life and Carol DiMaiti
Stuart's death.
   ``It's a very difficult situation to turn a relative in, or a
neighbor,'' said a DiMaiti family neighbor. ``I would say, `Do you
know that I know what you did?' I wouldn't turn them in. I would
tell them that.''
   Those who knew the secret kept it for 71 days, from the night of
Oct. 23, when Carol Stuart, a lawyer seven months pregnant, was
shot in the back of the head, until shortly before the chilly dawn
of Jan. 4, when her husband leaped to his death from a bridge over
the Mystic River.
   Few doubted Stuart's story that a mugger had shot him and his
wife after they left a childbirth class at Boston's Brigham and
Women's Hospital. His corroboration was a near fatal bullet in his
gut.
   But Stuart's terrible secret eventually unraveled.
   Matthew Stuart went to police Jan. 3, telling detectives his big
brother had him dispose of a gun and Carol Stuart's belongings.
   Charles Stuart, who knew of his brother's discussions with
police, threw himself off the bridge, trying to take with him
details of a plot to kill his wife, perhaps for insurance money to
start a restaurant.
   But the secret wasn't just Matt's and Chuck's.
   Other family members knew. Chuck apparently approached another
brother, Michael, weeks before the murder, but Michael spurned a
proposal made in a ``disjointed, vague conversation,'' according to
family attorney Richard Clayman. On Oct. 26, Matthew shared with
Michael what had happened with Chuck three days before.
   And on Jan. 2, a firehouse recording system taped a telephone
conversation between Michael, a firefighter, and a half-sister,
Shelley Yandoli. They decided to tell their parents that Chuck was
involved but not to say that they feared he had killed Carol.
   Police quizzed a Stuart friend about a conversation he'd had
with Chuck a few months ago about ``taking care of'' Carol, but
they said he refused to confirm the story until Stuart's suicide.
And there was Matthew's friend who reportedly threw the gun into a
Revere river. He, too, kept silent.
   Yet the secret's smoldering ember created a smoke of gossip that
drifted through this city and others circling Boston.
   ``I heard maybe two weeks after it, `Oh, he killed her, he
killed her.' But it was brushed off,'' said Dede Zorzy, a waitress
at Snack Time Restaurant.
   The rumors reached reporters in mid-December. A rumor that a
radio station had reported Stuart a suspect prompted a flood of
calls to Boston police, who called the rumor absurd. But in Revere,
it persisted.
   ``That was the talk in my beauty parlor weeks ago _ that he did
it for the insurance money,'' said one woman on her way out of a
convenience store with a gallon of milk. ``I said `Come on,' but
the girls said it was true, that they heard it.''
   Like many people encountered in the area, she wouldn't give her
name.
   ``Revere has a long history of keeping secrets,'' said the
manager of a local shop. The man, a Midwesterner who settled here
more than 40 years ago, still feels the outsider.
   Now, a week and a half after the truth ricocheted around the
nation, people are more tight-lipped than ever.
   From the bars to the beauty parlors, out-of-town inquisitors
meet opaque denials. ``No comment,'' they mostly say, with a
knowing lift of the eyebrow, or an icy smile as they escort callers
to the door.
   Children grow up in this city of 50,000 learning that it's best
to keep what you know to yourself, said Jon Cinelli, who works in a
video store.
   ``This is a rough city, a tough city,'' Cinelli said. Keeping
your mouth shut, he said, ``that's the way to survive.''
   ``The bars have gotten so that the guys are (playing)
ignorant,'' said Bobby, a 31-year-old Revere native. ``It's more
for the (Stuart) family. They've been through enough.''
   This protectiveness helps explain why the horrible secret was
kept so long. The blue-collar communities north of Boston are
places where people marry high school sweethearts and never really
leave. A neighbor might well be a family member; pretty soon
everyone gets the same protection.
   Carol Stuart came from that kind of place, growing up in
Medford, 10 miles to the northwest. A neighbor said that in that
tight-knit community a person is judged by their trustworthiness.
   ``We are all protective,'' he said, ``and if I knew my neighbor
well, I would do anything to help them.''

   The board of Campeau Corp. voted to separate
control of its U.S. retailing operations from the parent company,
removing Chairman Robert Campeau from involvement in the
restructuring of the troubled businesses.
   In a statement issued Thursday from its Toronto headquarters,
the company said it was transferring majority control of the U.S.
retailers _ Federated Department Stores Inc., Allied Stores Corp.
and Ralphs Grocery Co. _ to a voting trust that eventually will
appoint a separate board of directors for those businesses.
   Robert Campeau, the company's founder who led it on the
expansion strategy that analysts say caused its financial mess,
stated he would be involved only in the management and development
of real estate.

   Campeau Corp. painted a gloomy sales picture

   The Canadian corporation disclosed its best- and worst-case
scenarios for the next five years in a filing with the Securities

   In the document, released Thursday, Campeau projected that
Allied Stores Corp. and Federated Department Stores Inc. earnings
could fall by as much as 6.4 percent in the 1990 fiscal year.

   The Interior Department, responding to
protests from coal-producing states, said it would move to reverse
a rule that cost federal and state government millions of dollars
in royalty payments.
   Former Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel had approved the
change in the way royalties are calculated during the Reagan
administration. But Assistant Interior Secretary David C. O'Neal
said in a statement Thursday that the department was ``proposing a
return to the historic formula.''
   At present, before paying the government for coal taken out of
public land, producers are allowed to deduct taxes and fees,
including ``black lung'' taxes, mine reclamation fees and state
severence taxes.
   During the first six months after the change, government
royalties dropped by 15 percent, or more than $16 million, the
Interior Department said. Half of that money goes back to coal
producing states, and the Western Governors Association had led the
charge to have the rule rescinded.
   O'Neal emphasized that the rollback was merely a proposal and
that the department will be asking public comment before making any
actual change.

<TEXT>
   With $675, you could buy some nice things on The
Ginza, Tokyo's glittery shopping district.
   But if you're looking to rent commercial space there, $675 will
fetch one square foot for a year, according to a private survey of
the world's priciest streets released Thursday.
   The Ginza topped the list for the second straight year,
according to Huberth &amp; Peters Inc., a commercial real estate firm.
   Moving into second place was Nathan Road-Queens Road in Hong
Kong, bumping New York's East 57th Street to third. Another Asian
thoroughfare, Orchard Road in Singapore, replaced Toronto's Bloor
Street in the top 10.
   New York continued to have the most streets on the list, with
four.
   The top 10, with annual cost of a square foot of space:
   _The Ginza, Tokyo, $675.
   _Nathan Road-Queens Road, Hong Kong, $575.
   _East 57th Street, New York, $550.
   _Fifth Avenue, New York, $500.
   _Madison Avenue, New York, $400.
   _Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills, Calif., $275.
   _Lexington Avenue, New York, $225.
   _Bond Street, London, $200.
   _Rue du Faubourg, Paris, $175.
   _Orchard Road, Singapore, $175.
   ``If there's a common denominator in the most expensive streets,
it's that they almost always contain designer names and upscale
shops,'' said Michael Hirschfeld, chief marketing officer of
Huberth &amp; Peters.
   Hirschfeld said several streets resembled the upscale top 10,
but have rents below the others.
   They include Michigan Avenue, Chicago; Champs Elysee, Paris; Via
Condotti, Rome; Regent Street, London; Newbury Street, Boston;
Union Square, San Francisco; Columbus Avenue, New York; Worth
Avenue, Palm Beach, Fla.; Bloor Street, Toronto; and Rue du Rhone,
Geneva.
   Average rents on those streets range from $160 on the Champs
Elysee to $95 on Worth Avenue.

<TEXT>
   Eric Gleacher, head of the mergers and
acquisitions department at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., has resigned from
the investment banking firm to form his own company.
   Gleacher said Thursday his firm, Gleacher &amp; Co., would advise
clients on mergers and acquisitions and would itself be an investor
in selected transactions.
   During six years at Morgan Stanley, Gleacher helped advise the
leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. in its $24.53
billion buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. and Bank of New York Co. in its
$1.5 billion buyout of Irving Bank Corp.
   He also assisted Texaco Inc. in its defense against takeover
strategist Carl Icahn and Gillette Co. in its battles against
Revlon Inc. and Coniston Partners.
   Gleacher, 49, spent 16 years at Lehman Brothers, a predecessor
to Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., before moving to Morgan Stanley in
1983.
   Morgan Stanley said Gleacher would be succeeded by Bruce
Fiedorek and Stephen Waters, who would serve as co-heads of mergers
and acquisitions.
   Fiedorek, 38, joined Morgan Stanley in 1976 and has been in
mergers and acquisitions since then, the company said in a
statement.
   Waters, 43, joined Morgan Stanley in 1988 afer co-directing the
mergers and acquisitions department at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   Morgan Stanley led investment bankers in 1989 in terms of the
dollar amount of deals closed, according to the financial research
firm Securities Data Corp. Morgan Stanley completed 167
transactions worth a total of $119.8 billion.
   But investors did not appear concerned that Gleacher's departure
would take a heavy toll on the firm. Morgan Stanley's stock rose
12{ cents to $65.62{ a share in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading Thursday.
   Gleacher's resignation recalled the decision by First Boston
Corp. superstars Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph Perella to resign and
start their own investment boutique in 1988.
   But Wasserstein and Perella left following a shakeup at First
Boston, and analysts said it appeared that Gleacher was leaving on
better terms from Morgan Stanley.
   In a statement, Gleacher praised his co-workers at Morgan
Stanley, saying he regretted leaving the company, but ``after 22
years of working for major investment banks, I felt the urge to
build a business from the ground up.''

<HEAD>U.S., Japan Launch Industrial Cooperation Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Japan have launched a
program to identify opportunities for industrial cooperation
between the two nations.
   Also, President Bush and Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher
praised a Japanese plan to reduce its huge trade surplus and become
an ``import superpower.''
   The developments Thursday came during a visit by Japanese trade
minister Hikaru Matsunaga.
   Mosbacher said a Japanese program of tax and tariff incentives
``sounds like an impressive start on the road to building
imports.'' He said the Commerce Department will help U.S. exporters
take advantage of the program.
   Bush told Matsunaga in a brief meeting that the United States
``highly appreciated'' the Japanese import expansion program, the
Japanese Embassy said. Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu told
Bush last year he wanted to transform export-wealthy Japan into an
``import superpower.''
   Bush also praised the Joint Industrial Cooperation Initiative
announced by Mosbacher and stressed the importance of U.S.-Japanese
cooperation in policies toward China and Eastern Europe, embassy
spokeswoman Yoshiko Arima said.
   The agreement is between the Commerce Department and Japan's
Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
   Mosbacher said he hoped the initiative would ``promote a better
understanding of the policy development process that ... will help
to reduce the potential for bilateral friction and enhance our
prospects for expanded and fruitful commercial ties.''
   A Japanese official said Bush told Matsunaga on Wednesday he
favors free trade with Japan and opposes a system of managed trade
and quotas favored by some members of Congress.

   Both the commercial and residential real estate
markets will remain in the dumps in early part of this decade, two
economists told mortgage bankers.
   Home construction will be affected not only by the turmoil on
the savings and loan industry but also by dramatic demographic
changes as the baby boom generation ages into its prime home-owning
years, said Lynn O. Michaelis, chief economist at Weyerhaeuser Co.
   Michaelis said Thursday that the baby boom generation ``is not
experiencing the ... real income growth of the previous group'' of
homeowners a decade earlier.
   He predicted housing starts would drift to 1.26 million
single-and multi-family units this year, down from about 1.5
million units built in 1988, but could rise to 1.31 million in 1991.
   Michaelis, who spoke at the fifth annual economic outlook
conference sponsored by the Mortgage Bankers Association of
America, said the problem was more complex than simply slowing
sales.
   ``There is a dramatic shift in who is originating mortgages,''
he said. The upheaval in the savings and loan industry, which had
been the major originator of adjustable rate mortgages that made
homebuying affordable for many, will make purchasing a home a more
difficult exercise.
   ``Rates and qualifying rules are getting tougher,'' Michaelis
said, as commercial banks eat into the mortgage turf that once
belonged to the savings and loans. In addition, because single
family homes are appreciating at roughly 3.6 percent a year,
potential buyers simply do not see their house as a great
investment.
   ``Home sales suggest the industry is stable, but it does not
lead me to a bullish view'' that more than one million
single-family homes will be built this year, Michaelis said.
   On the commercial front, prospects were considered gloomier.
Although commercial construction has been in a steady decline since
its 1985 peak, there continues to be a big surplus of offices,
shopping centers, apartments and hotels, said George Christie, vice
president and chief economist of McGraw-Hill Construction
Information Group.
   ``By the end of 1987, the surplus of aggregate commercial space
was about 800 million square feet,'' Christie said. Of that, 50
percent represents office space, 40 percent represents condominiums
and apartments and 10 percent is in retail space and hotels.
   Despite the oversupply, contracting for the building of even
more commercial space had been running at just under 1 billion
square feet a year even though demand was deteriorating.
   ``The only implication is that more underbuilding is the
prescription,'' Christie said. ``We're only beginning the process
of cleaning up the excesses of the 1980s.''
   He predicted the industry would reach relative supply-demand
equilibrium sometime between 1993 and 1994 if building continues to
slow.
   The good news is that the construction of public works, which
had been put on the back burner during the 1980s, ``out of sheer
necessity will see some reordering of priorities,'' Christie said.
He cited schools and health-care facilities as likely areas of
construction.

<HEAD>Campeau Board Placing U.S. Operations Under Trustees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL MENEZES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Directors of Campeau Corp. have removed control
of the company's U.S. retailing operations from the parent company,
ending founder Robert Campeau's direction of the department stores
in apparent bid to appease creditors.
   In a statement issued Thursday night from its Toronto
headquarters, the company said it was transferring majority control
of the U.S. retailers _ Federated Department Stores Inc., Allied
Stores Corp. and Ralphs Grocery Co. _ to a voting trust that
eventually will appoint a separate board of directors for those
businesses.
   Until the trustees are appointed, the retailers' daily
operations and restructuring will be managed by Campeau's six
independent directors, the company said.
   Robert Campeau, who led the company on an expansion strategy
that analysts say caused its downfall, stated he would be involved
only in the management and development of the company's real estate.
   The board's moves appeared to be further steps to assure
creditors of Federated and Allied that the companies could work out
their financial woes.
   Carol Sanger, a spokeswoman for Campeau at the retailers'
Cincinnati headquarters, said she could not comment on why the
board took its actions. She also said she did not know whether
Robert Campeau voluntarily removed himself from management of the
U.S. retailing divisions or had been asked to do so by the board.
   There has been wide speculation in the retail trade that Campeau
might place Federated and Allied under bankruptcy court protection
from creditors. The divisions have been struggling to pay their
bills under the weight of huge debts.
   But on Wednesday, Campeau said it was sending some $100 million
in payments on schedule to numerous merchandise suppliers,
signaling its interest in maintaining good relations with
manufacturers that do business with its nearly 260 U.S. department
stores.
   Also on Wednesday, the restructuring committee of the Campeau
board announced the appointment of a new chief financial officer to
take charge of rebuilding Campeau's U.S. holdings, which in
addition to the retailing businesses include shopping malls and
other commercial real estate.
   Campeau's financial problems were caused chiefly by the heavy
debt it incurred when it bought Federated in 1988 for $6.6 billion
and Allied two years earlier for $3.4 billion. In a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission this week, Campeau indicated the
combined debts for Federated and Allied totaled about $8 billion.
   That filing indicated that even if all the assets of the retail
divisions were sold in a liquidation, the debt may not be covered.
   The Canadian property company Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd.
provided a $250 million cash infusion last year to enable the
company to meet its debt payments and Campeau agreed to restructure
its operations and attempt to reorganize its finances.
   However, problems have continued. Citibank and other members of
a group owed $2.34 billion by Allied and Federated have indicated
they believed the companies were in default on the loan, and gave
them until Monday to give assurance that was not the case.
   Last week, National Bank of Canada acquired a 29 percent stake
in Campeau after Robert Campeau defaulted on a bank loan to two of
his private investment companies.
   In its statement on Thursday, Campeau Corp. said its board
approved resolutions placing the responsibility for the management
and financial restructuring of Federated and Allied with the
yet-to-be-appointed board of Campeau (U.S.) and a chief executive,
to be named by that board.
   The New York Times reported in today's editions that Campeau
approached the president and chief executive of Neiman-Marcus
Stores, Allen I. Questrom, to be that chief executive. But it
quoted a Neiman-Marcus official as saying that Questrom was not
interested in the offer.
   The new board of Campeau (U.S.) is to be composed of U.S.
residents who are independent of Campeau Corp.
   Campeau had indicated it would appoint a chief executive officer
and chief financial officer as one of the conditions of its $250
million loan from Olympia &amp; York, a major Campeau shareholder.
   Part of the restructuring plan already mapped out involves
selling the Bloomingdale's department store chain, considered one
of Campeau's most valuable possessions.
   The Times, citing unidentified sources, reported that Campeau's
board had considered a plan to offer a 75 percent ownership stake
in all its department stores to bondholders in exchange for a large
portion of their high-yield ``junk'' bonds. That plan, which
apparently was rejected, would have lowered Campeau's interest
payments.
   Besides the 17 Bloomingdale's, Federated operates: 14 Abraham &amp;
Straus stores; 30 Burdines; 43 Lazarus stores; and 26
Rich's-Goldsmith's.
   Under the Allied umbrella are: 39 Bon Marche stores; 26 Jordan
Marsh stores; 38 Maas Brothers-Jordan Marsh stores; and 24 Stern's.
   Campeau also operates 134 Ralphs supermarkets in California.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp. is telling its major lenders and
creditors that it expects sales to drop for the next two years at
its retailing businesses.
   Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission also
disclosed that a total liquidation of Campeau's two major American
retailing divisions, Allied Stores Corp. and Federated Department
Stores Inc., might not be enough to pay off the two divisions'
combined debts of $8 billion.
   The Canadian corporation, which amassed the huge debt in
acquiring Allied and Federated, disclosed its best and worse-case
scenarios for the next five years in the SEC filing, which was
released Thursday.
   Campeau projected that Allied and Federated earnings could fall
by up to 6.4 percent in the 1990 fiscal year.
   The SEC papers were peppered with disclaimers that the
projections ``may or may not prove to be correct'' and had been
prepared only to inform major creditors about ``possible
restructuring.''
   Both Allied and Federated face a Monday deadline to renegotiate
a $2.34 billion loan from a syndicate headed by Citibank.
   There was no mention in the documents of plans to seek U.S.
Bankruptcy Code protection from creditors. However, the document
noted, ``There can be no assurance that restructurings can be
completed on satisfactory terms, within a satisfactory time frame,
if at all.''
   On Thursday, Campeau's board said it would transfer control of
its U.S. division to trustees. It also said the division would
appoint its own chairman and board of independent directors.
   Campeau's problems stem chiefly from the debt it acquired when
it bought Federated in 1988 for $6.6 billion and Allied two years
earlier for $3.4 billion.
   In its filing, Campeau projected earnings for Allied and
Federated would fall as much as 6.4 percent in fiscal year 1990 due
to ``management distraction, limitations on the company's ability
to negotiate better prices with vendors and increased promotions
needed to stimulate business.'' It said earnings would recover in
1991.
   The corporation projected that it would return to a normal
operating environment by the beginning of fiscal year 1992.
   Campeau projected Federated would have operating earnings of
$483 million on sales of $4.92 billion for fiscal 1989 and Allied
would have operating earnings of $273 million on sales of $2.74
billion.
   Campeau also stated that its projections had not been updated
since it opened talks Dec. 13 with major creditors about possible
financial restructurings.
   The documents also stressed that the unusual operating problems
facing the company made the projections highly uncertain.
   Another set of projections assumed that Allied and Federated
might have to operate under increased restrictions imposed by
suppliers and factors _ the middlemen who finance purchases _ which
in turn could ``significantly impair their ability to obtain
inventory.''
   Inventory could be off by as much as $400 million retail
compared to the projection for fiscal year 1990.
   The SEC document projected an after-tax price of $3.40 billion
to $3.70 billion if all of Federated's divisions were sold
individually under the best circumstances. The price would fall to
$2.55 billion to $2.70 billion if the divisions were sold under
``distressed'' circumstances, such as in a bankruptcy
reorganization.
   A fire sale of Allied's divisions would net $1.2 billion to
$1.35 billion, Campeau projected, compared with $1.60 billion to
$1.80 billion in an ``orderly process.''
   According to the documents, Federated has a total debt and
accrued interest of $5.19 billion, while Allied's debt with
interest is $2.99 billion.
   The documents projected an after-tax liquidation deficit of
$1.68 billion to $835 million for Federated and $1.79 billion to
$1.39 billion for Allied, depending upon the circumstances of a
sell-off.
   Allied alone is expected to pay $113 million in debt service
next year, $106 million in 1991, $379 million in 1992, $6 million
in 1993 and $4 million in 1994, assuming refinancing.

<HEAD>GM May Be First U.S. Automaker Into Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. says it is in the final leg
of talks with Hungary to establish a joint venture, possibly making
it the first U.S. carmaker to enter the recently liberalized
markets of Eastern Europe.
   If GM completes the deal, which company spokesman John Pekarek
said Thursday was in ``advanced stages,'' it could represent one of
the largest U.S. projects in the Eastern bloc.
   Pekarek declined to give details of the talks, other than to say
a decision about the project should be reached soon. He would not
confirm or deny a report from London in Thursday's Wall Street
Journal saying the negotiations centered on a $180-million project
to build cars and engines in Hungary.
   Pekarek said GM had no other negotiations under way involving
any other Eastern European project.
   GM would not be the first automaker to announce a deal with
Hungary. Suzuki Motor Co. of Japan said Tuesday it would build a
$138.9.million assembly plant near Budapest, the Hungarian capital,
to make Suzuki Swift subcompact cars beginning in 1992.
   A potential GM-Hungarian deal was news to auto analyst Kathleen
Heaney of Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. of New York.
   ``I'm just surprised at how quickly they (GM) moved because of
their nature,'' she said. ``Europe is a whole 'nother world for
them. Their (European) products look good and they're profitable.''
   However, she said, establishing a factory in Hungary would be
good for GM by giving it needed capacity.
   GM and Ford Motor Co. each have profitable businesses in Europe,
which recently have been bolstering sagging U.S. operations.
Chrysler Corp. markets some of its cars on the Continent, but has
no independent manufacturing plants there.
   Last month, GM agreed to acquire half of the car business of
Sweden's Saab-Scania AB for about $600 million. That announcement
came on the heels of Ford's acquisition of the British luxury
carmaker Jaguar PLC for $2.5 billion.
   GM already makes and sells Opel and Vauxhall vehicles in Europe.
It also owns all of Britain's Group Lotus PLC. Ford, which has the
largest European presence of any U.S. automaker, makes cars and
vans there carrying the Ford nameplate.
   Ford has no active negotiations involving Eastern European
production, said spokeswoman Lin Cummins. She said, however, that
the world's second-largest automaker behind GM is watching
developments closely.
   ``There would seem to be a good chance that multinational
companies will find opportunities for major business deals there in
the course of the next several years,'' she said.
   Chrysler officials also have said they have been surprised at
the speed of change in Eastern Europe and that later it would
provide a large market for vehicles.
   Heaney speculated it would be five years before any U.S.
automaker could begin making cars in Eastern Europe, partly because
of difficulties in converting the communist nations' currency into
dollars and partly because of the lack of personal wealth in
Eastern Europe.
   ``The consumers just don't have the money,'' she said.
   Other U.S. corporations also have moved to take advantage of the
rapid changes in Eastern Europe. General Electric Co. in November
agreed to pay $150 million for a majority stake in Tungsram,
Hungary's state-owned lighting manufacturer.

   A German company has agreed to buy a small U.S.
distributor of printing machinery. What's unique about the deal is
that the buyer is a state-owned company in East Germany.
   Veb Kombinat Polygraph Leipzig Werner Lambertz, a maker of
printing machinery for the graphic arts industry, has agreed to buy
its U.S. importer and distributor, Royal Zenith Inc. of Great Neck,
N.Y., for $25 million, the West German bank financing the
transaction said Thursday.
   Royal Zenith, which has been renamed Planeta North America Inc.,
has been Polygraph's sole U.S. distributor for about 30 years, said
Allan Malachuk, president of the U.S. company.
   Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel Bank Ag (Hypobank), which
announced the deal in Munich, said it is the first time a
state-owned East German firm has bought a foreign company.
   A bank official who requested anonymity said negotiations began
last year while the government of Erich Honecker was still in
power. But the acquisition would not have been possible without the
peaceful revolution that deposed the hardline Communist regime in
the fall, he said.
   Royal Zenith was sold by Dyson-Kissner-Moran Corp., a New
York-based investment firm. DKM did not require any U.S. government
approval to sell Royal Zenith, which it had owned for about 10
years, said John Fitzsimons, DKM's general counsel.
   Fitzsimons and Malachuk declined to comment on the reasons for
the sale.
   Polygraph is a trading company for five state-run East German
factories, one of which is named Planeta and makes the equipment
that is sold in the United States, Malachuk said.
   The equipment includes printing machinery for the folding carton
industry, Malachuk said. He declined to disclose Royal Zenith's
sales.
   Standard &amp; Poor's 1989 register of U.S. corporates said Royal
Zenith had sales of about $80 million. The company employs around
300 people, Hypo-bank said.

<HEAD>Government May Have To Ensure Margins High Enough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Bush administration official has
suggested that the federal government may have to step in to ensure
that margin requirements on stock index futures are set high enough
to prevent a market free fall.
   Margins for stocks and stock options already are set by the
government, but private futures exchanges set their own margins. A
margin is the deposit required by a brokerage firm from an investor
to buy a stock, stock option or stock futures contract.
   ``Shouldn't futures margins bear the same public scrutiny?''
Treasury Undersecretary Robert R. Glauber asked Thursday. ``Why
should ... a handful of people be able to to drive the entire
market into free fall?''
   The Federal Reserve requires professional securities traders to
make a down payment of 20 percent to 25 percent of the amount of
stock they purchase. But futures markets speculators can control an
equivalent stock position by putting up as little as 4 percent.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Richard Breeden have called on the futures
markets to raise their margins.
   But Glauber, speaking at a seminar sponsored by the American
Legal Institute-American Bar Association, said: ``We have seen
little progress.''
   Although he declined to endorse a specific level for futures
margins, Glauber said the need for ``harmonized margins'' was
``critical ... to prevent the market system from generating
excessive volatility.''
   Members of Congress have supported expanding the power of the
Federal Reserve to stock index futures margins. Glauber said the
Working Group on Financial Markets, an inter-agency committee, will
examine the possibility of giving this authority to the Fed, the
SEC or the Treasury.
   The futures exchanges have vigorously defended their power to
set their own margins, arguing that the nature of futures trading
requires a smaller margin than stock trading. The exchanges also
say higher margins would drive business to overseas markets.
   Glauber rejected that, saying, ``The key to preserving U.S.
leadership in global financial markets is effective regulation, not
competition in laxity.''
   On a related matter, Glauber said futures and stock exchanges
needed to do a better job coordinating ``circuit-breakers,'' which
automatically halt trading for a brief time when prices fall
precipitously.
   He did not suggest government should take that role, but he said
the 190-point stock slide last Oct. 13 pointed to the need for some
changes in the private arrangement between the New York Stock
Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   The circuit-breaker in the Chicago market kicked in when the
futures market fell the equivalent of 100 points on the Dow Jones
industrial average. But the New York circuit breaker, set to halt
trading after a 250-point fall, never took effect.
   That can permit selling pressure to be transferred from the
closed futures markets to open stock markets, Glauber said.

<HEAD>Government Seeks To Trim Razor Blade Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is seeking a court order to
halt Gillette Co.'s acquisition of part of Wilkinson Sword's
worldwide razor-blade business.
   In asking Thursday for a temporary restraining order in U.S.
District Court, the antitrust division of the Justice Department
said Gillette would sell more than 53 percent of razor blades sold
in the United States if the deal were completed.
   Gillette is the dominant supplier of wet shaving razor blades in
the United States and Wilkinson Sword (USA) is one of only four
other significant competitors.
   In announcing its intention Tuesday to file suit, the department
said Gillette had 65 percent of the personal shaving blade market
and Wilkinson had 3 percent, and a combination posed the threat of
lesser competition and significantly higher prices for U.S.
consumers. There was no explanation given for the lower market
share figure cited in Thursday's petition to the court.
   Kenneth M. Frankel, a Justice Department attorney, disclosed at
a court hearing that a memorandum written at one of the companies
says Wilkinson's European plant ``will cease production'' for the
American market once the transaction is completed. He did not say
where the memo was written.
   Thomas Cullen, an attorney representing Gillette, said the
document is a draft that is ``not final'' and he immediately asked
that the document stamped ``confidential'' not be available for
public inspection. Cullen said any decision to close the European
plant would not be made by Gillette, but by a Dutch concern
operated by the current managers of Wilkinson.
   Judge Thomas Hogan agreed to place the memo under seal. He said
he will rule next Tuesday on the request for a temporary
restraining order.
   At a court hearing, Gillette asserted that no temporary
restraining order is warranted because the deal with Wilkinson
won't be completed until mid-March, leaving plenty of time for the
government to seek a regular injunction against it.
   Frankel argued that the transaction could be accelerated.
   The question regarding Wilkinson's operations is ``will they
wither'' under Gillette's control ``and the answer is likely
`yes,''' said Frankel.
   Cullen disagreed, saying the result will be U.S. sales of the
``same product at the same stand.''

   Nine months after a ruling required states
to tax federal pensions the same as other public pensions, few
retired federal pensioners have collected their back taxes, but
states fear losing millions in revenues.
   An Associated Press survey shows that only eight of the 24
states affected by the ruling have agreed to give federal retirees
the same tax break on their pensions that state retirees have
enjoyed.
   The remaining 16 have yet to act or chose to give all public
retirees a minimal exemption rather than lose revenue by exempting
federal pensions. At least 17 states are being sued over the issue.
   A chain reaction of legal and fiscal snarls has grown out of the
lawsuit brought by Paul S. Davis, a retired attorney with the
Securities and Exchange Commission who lives in East Lansing.
   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in March that states can't tax the
pensions of retired federal workers while exempting some or all of
the pensions of state and local retirees. Davis, who represented
himself, won $4,299 in back taxes from Michigan.
   States' choices included giving federal retirees the same tax
break as state and local ones, or repealing the tax break for state
and local retirees and taxing all public pensions equally.
   In Michigan, where the suit originated, the state Court of
Appeals ordered the state to exempt all federal pensions from
taxes, a decision that will cost the Michigan treasury about $6
million a year and will affect about 24,000 federal retirees.
   Tax breaks also were given to federal retirees in Montana, North
Dakota, New Mexico, Wisconsin, New York, West Virginia and
Louisiana.
   In 11 other states _ Virginia, Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia,
Oregon, South Carolina, Iowa, Colorado, Missouri, Oklahoma and Utah
_ lawmakers chose to provide the same limited tax exemption for all
public pensions.
   But in Virginia, which also gave the same $16,000 exemption to
private pensions, the cost is pegged at $250 million over the next
two years, eating up the state's $70 million reserve and
complicating the budget-writing process.
   The issue has been forced onto the November ballot in Oregon by
federal retirees who call the state's response a sham. Lawmakers
agreed to tax state pensions equally with the federal ones but then
voted a benefit increase to state retirees to make up the
difference.
   Legislatures in Alabama, Kentucky and Mississippi have yet to
decide what to do, while Arkansas and Kansas argue the law doesn't
apply to them and are being sued by federal retirees.
   Lawsuits have been filed in 17 states by chapters of the
National Association of Retired Federal Employees, seeking refunds
of taxes paid as far back as 10 years, said association spokesman
Denis Harrington.
   A pair of cases pending before the U.S. Supreme Court could
decide whether states must pay refunds if tax laws are declared
unconstitutional.
   If the refunds are approved, ``that's going to be the thing that
eats states alive,'' said Marcia Howard, research director for the
National Association of State Budget Officers.
   Figures from an August survey by the National Conference of
State Legislatures said the hardest-hit states will be those with
large numbers of federal retirees, such as Virginia, which could
owe $370 million in tax refunds to its 200,000 federal retirees.
   In Missouri, lawmakers approved $120 million in temporary sales
and corporate income tax increases to pay refunds to 65,000 federal
retirees ordered by the Missouri Supreme Court.
   Processing those refunds would be a headache in itself, said Tim
Leathers, Arkansas state revenue commissioner, who estimates the
state could receive 100,000 amended returns seeking $25 million if
it agreed to the refunds.
   The state normally processes 11,000 amended returns, he said.
``We're talking about eight years worth of extra work. It may take
a couple of years or so to get them done,'' he said.
   In Georgia, state retirees sued when their pensions were taxed,
arguing it was a breach of their contract with the state. They
vowed to appeal after losing the first round of the court battle.
   In Montana, a group of private retirees went to court in
November contending the state's decision to treat government
retirees differently from private retirees was inequitable and
unconstitutional. A similar lawsuit is pending in Alabama.

   U.S. automakers have announced another round of
temporary layoffs scheduled to begin later this month and into
February, showing a continued downturn in the industry.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. each
said Thursday that slumping sales and high inventories were the
reasons behind the temporary layoffs, which affect about 56,800
workers.
   In addition to those layoffs, GM and Chrysler plan to
indefinitely idle entire plants or single shifts in two-shift
operations beginning Feb. 2. The indefinite layoffs involve about
13,000 workers.
   Some workers will be part of a temporary layoff and then,
without going back to work, be laid off indefinitely. The
distinction is important in the calculation of benefits.
   During the first two weeks of January, more than 127,000 workers
at the Big Three automakers were laid off for at least a week.
Additional layoff time indicates that inventories still are too
high and the sales rate still is too low to suit the automakers.
   General Motors Corp. said nine of its 31 U.S. assembly plants
will be down between Jan. 16-22, affecting about 25,500 workers.
   Ford Motor Co. said four of its 15 assembly plants would be down
in late January and early February, affecting about 9,700 employees.
   And Chrysler Corp. said six of its eight plants would not be
making cars or trucks for at least a week apiece between Monday and
the first two weeks of next month. About 21,600 workers are
affected.
   ``All of the temporary plant idlings are due to inventory
adjustment,'' a Chrysler news release said.
   In the first indication that the industry's downturn may begin
affecting a Japanese-owned plant in the United States, Mazda Motor
Corp. said it would trim production at its factory in Flat Rock,
Mich., later this month.
   Mazda spokesman Jim Gill said Wednesday line speed at the plant
south of Detroit would be reduced to 55 cars an hour from the
current 62-cars-an-hour rate.
   Gill said temporary jobs at the plant would be eliminated and
assembly employees displaced by the production cut would be
transferred to other departments or into training programs. There
are about 2,800 employees at the factory.
   Car and truck sales began falling in October, as the 1990 model
year began. But months before, auto analysts had predicted
production cuts in the first quarter of this year, mainly because
of continued high production levels in the face of slumping demand.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Share Prices Post Biggest Drop In Two Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar gained ground slightly against the
Japanese yen Friday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange registered its biggest drop in over two years.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
473.62 points Thursday, lost 653.36 points, or 1.71 percent,
closing the week at 37,516.77.
   It was the biggest single-day loss in the Nikkei index since it
shed 731.91 points on Nov. 10, 1987.
   The dollar closed at 145.35 yen, up 0.08 yen from Thursday's
close of 145.27 yen. After opening at 145.42 yen, the currency
ranged between 145.30 yen and 145.55 yen.
   Currency dealers said the exchange market was mainly focused on
cross-trading, such as between the yen and the West German mark,
and the yen and the Swiss franc.
   Naoto Kawamura, a senior dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, said the
Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, stepped into the market
at 150.50 yen and sold dollars to support the Japanese currency
against its recent decline.
   On the stock market, the dollar's strength against the yen
deepened profit-taking sentiment, securities dealers said.

   Kellogg Co., the nation's largest
maker of ready-to-eat cereals, plans a 5 percent cut in its U.S.
white-collar work force of about 2,900 by year's end, the company
said.
   The approximately 145 jobs to be cut will be achieved
selectively, mainly through attrition, said Kellogg spokesman Neil
Nyberg.
   ``We'll be examining all our U.S. operations and making
determinations about how our organization needs to be best staffed
to meet competitive challenges,'' he said.
   Kellogg has 1,400 salaried employees based at its Battle Creek,
Mich., headquarters. The total U.S. work force of the country's
largest cereal maker is 9,000.
   Kellogg's cereal market lead has been eroded this year by No. 2
General Mills Inc., and company officials have said they expect
1989 earnings, due out this month, to show the first decline in
annual earnings in 37 years.
   Kellogg's brand cereals include, among others, Rice Krispies,
Frosted Flakes, Special K and Froot Loops.
   Nyberg said Wednesday the reductions began in late 1989.

   Stock prices took a sharp drop today, unsettled
by new inflation worries and market declines in Tokyo and London.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 34.77 points to
2,725.90 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 10 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 117 up,
1,151 down and 280 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 31.06 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of
finished goods rose 0.7 percent in December, exceeding most advance
estimates for that measure of inflationary pressures.
   The index finished 1989 with an increase of 4.8 percent, its
biggest in eight years.
   Analysts said the news dealt an abrupt setback to hopes on Wall
Street for any further moves soon by the Federal Reserve to relax
its credit policy and encourage lower interest rates.
   Stock traders also were absorbing word of overnight declines in
the Japanese and British markets, where interest-rate and inflation
worries have also been weighing down enthusiasm lately.
   Among actively traded blue chips, General Electric dropped 1&lsqb; to
63|; Exxon } to 48\; International Business Machines ~ to 99;
Philip Morris { to 39{, and McDonald's &rsqb; to 32&rsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
2.37 to 190.41. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 2.99 at 376.36.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 10.03 to
2,760.67.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 on the
NYSE, with 877 up, 570 down and 517 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 154.39 million shares, against 175.99

   Retail sales, reflecting a sluggish economy,
rose just 5 percent in 1989, the smallest gain in seven years, the
government said today.
   The Commerce Department said sales for all of 1989 totaled $1.71
trillion, down from 1988's 7.1 percent gain. It was the smallest
advance since a 2.9 percent increase in 1982.
   The economy was pinched through much of last year by high
interest rates caused by the Federal Reserve's tight credit
policies designed to contain inflation.
   Retail sales account for about one-third of the nation's
economic activity and thus are one barometer of the extent to which
the Fed's anti-inflation policies have slowed the economy.
   The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.2 percent in
December to a seasonally adjusted $144.4 billion after rising 0.5
percent in November.
   Part of the November increase was attributed by analysts to the
early start of the Christmas shopping during the weekend after
Thanksgiving and raised expectations of many merchants and analysts.
   But the December sales turned out to be modest and Commerce said
spending during the November-December period rose only 3.8 percent
over the same period in 1988, when sales were up 6.6 percent over
the previous two-month period. It was the lowest November-December
gain since sales rose 2.9 percent in 1985.
   Half or more of retail profits come from business done between
Thaksgiving and Christmas.
   Sales of durable goods _ big-ticket items such as cars and
household appliances expected to last more than three years _ fell
0.6 percent after edging up 0.1 percent in November.
   Durable goods, which often are financed by loans and thus are
susceptible to interest rates, have been hit hardest by Fed
policies.
   Auto sales, which have been in the doldrums since the 1990
models were introduced in October, fell 0.7 percent in December
after a 0.4 percent decline in November. Auto sales represent about
22 percent of retail spending.
   Auto sales finished the year up just 2.2 percent compared to a
10.3 percent gain in 1988. It was the lowest since sales declined
8.1 percent in 1980.
   Excluding autos, overall sales in December were up 0.4 percent.
   Among other durable sales, building materials rose 0.1 percent
on top of a 0.7 percent rise in November, while furniture and other
home furnishings declined 1 percent after a 0.7 percent increase a
month earlier.
   Sales of non-durable goods rose 0.6 percent after gaining 0.8
percent in November.
   Gains were posted in grocery stores, up 0.6 percent, and
gasoline stations, up 1.3 percent, due in part to higher prices.
Apparel sales advanced 0.1 percent.
   Declines were posted in department store sales, down 0.4
percent; restaurants and bars, down 0.9 percent, and drug stores,
down 1 percent.
   For the three months from October through December, overall
retail sales were up 3.6 percent.

   The nation's two largest airlines are raising
most cargo rates to help offset surging jet fuel costs, and other
big carriers say they are considering such a move.
   American Airlines and United Airlines said Thursday they are
increasing airport-to-airport cargo rates 5 percent in the
continental United States and are making steeper hikes for Hawaii,
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Industry leader American
and No. 2 United also are applying for government approval to raise
cargo rates for foreign countries.
   Rates for door-to-door cargo service, in which the airlines
compete with courier companies such as Federal Express, won't
change.
   American and United blamed the increases on the rising cost of
jet fuel, which has jumped to nearly $1 a gallon from 64 cents at
the end of October as oil prices have climbed.
   ``Because of the astonishing increase in fuel costs, we have no
other choice than to increase our (cargo) rates,'' William R.
Boesch, American's vice president for cargo, said in a statement.
   Last week, many major airlines raised domestic passenger fares 4
percent to cover fuel costs, and some carriers added a special fuel
surcharge ranging from $5 to $20 per ticket. The surcharges were
the first such levies since the 1970s oil crisis.
   Spokesmen for Northwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines said
Thursday those carriers are weighing an increase in cargo rates.
   ``We are reviewing that right now but we haven't made a decision
yet,'' said Delta spokeswoman Jackie Pate in Atlanta.
   American's domestic rate increases are effective Feb. 15, while
United's are slated to begin March 1.
   American is raising cargo rates 8 percent to and from Puerto
Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and 12 percent for Hawaii.
American, based in Fort Worth, Texas, said it also has applied to
the Department of Transportation for a 12 percent hike for the
Caribbean and Mexico, 8 percent for Europe and Asia, and 5 percent
for Canada, effective April 1.
   Chicago-based United is raising rates 10 percent for Hawaii and
is applying for 5 percent for Canada, Mexico and Asia.

<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Are the credit markets ready for a 40-year
government bond?
   An indication could come Wednesday, when the agency established
to fund the bailout of failed savings and loans is scheduled to
announce details of its second bond offering.
   The Resolution Funding Corp., or Refcorp, has said it is
considering a 40-year bond, and many market watchers expect such an
issue to be among the bond offerings it discloses Wednesday.
   Some analysts are less than enthusiastic about the prospect of
government bond that is 10 years longer in maturity than any
current government issue.
   ``Given the problems that the 30-year Treasury bond is having,
there might be some doubt as to what type of reception this
particular maturity will receive,'' said John Lonski, senior
economist for Moody's Investors Service Inc.
   The 30-year Treasury, called the long bond, is considered the
benchmark issue for the trend of long-term interest rates. Its
yield is the figure most often quoted when someone asks how the
bond market did on a particular day.
   A 40-year bond would be even more sensitive to changes in
inflation, since the investor's money is tied up 10 years longer.
   ``You're really locking yourself into a position where a
disappointment regarding inflation will incur a greater loss,''
Lonski said.
   He said a 40-year bond would be almost as volatile in price as a
zero-coupon bond. Zero-coupon bonds pay no interest until they
reach maturity, and because of the delayed payout they are
extremely sensitive to inflation and changes in market interest
rates.
   Lonski said there are a number of 40-year telephone company
bonds on the market ``and their prices are the most sensitive of
any corporate bonds to interest rates.''
   Despite the drawbacks, Lonksi said there might be demand for
40-year government bonds among such long-term investors as pension
funds.
   A 40-year bond would have several advantages for Refcorp.
Chiefly, it would allow the agency to get more bang for its bucks.
   Refcorp must back its own bonds with zero-coupon Treasury bonds
it buys in the market. Forty-year bonds would cost about half as
much to collateralize as 30-year issues, according to Merrill Lynch
&amp; Co. Inc.
   The lower collateralization cost would allow Refcorp to issue
more bonds with the money available to it.
   Though investors would be tying up their money longer, a 40-year
Refcorp bond may yield less than the agency's 30-year issue,
Merrill Lynch projects.
   That's because of the market demand for zero-coupon bonds of
greater than 30 years' maturity, which are not currently available.
Zero-coupon bonds often are created by ``stripping'' the
interest-bearing coupon from an issue, such as a Refcorp, and then
selling the stripped bond and the coupons separately.
   Merrill Lynch estimates a 40-year Refcorp would yield 20-25
basis points more than the benchmark 30-year Treasury, while a
30-year Refcorp would yield about 30 basis points more than the
long bond. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
   Refcorp bonds yield more than Treasuries because of their
slightly greater risk. Treasuries are the standard for security
because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the
government.
   Salomon Brothers Inc., for one, thinks 40-year bonds wouldn't be
a good idea for Refcorp. It said in a recent commentary that they
could cannibalize demand for 30-year issues, which would raise the
yield of those bonds and thus make them more costly for the agency
to sell. That might eliminate any expected savings from the 40-year
issues.
   In addition, Salomon said, ``Little evidence exists of a huge
untapped pool of long-duration demand.''
   The Treasury also is exploring the possibility of a 40-year bond
of its own, said Art Siddon, the Treasury's chief spokesman.
   ``We're discussing it with people in the market, whether they
think there's demand for it,'' he said last week.
   If the Treasury goes ahead with a 40-year issue, it would not be
breaking new ground. The department issued 40-year bonds until
1955, when they were discontinued due to flagging demand, Siddon
said.
   In fact, the government early in this century even issued a
50-year bond, to fund the Panama Canal, he added.
   The duration of government securities in large part is
determined by market demand, he said. For example, he said, the
Treasury stopped issuing 20-year bonds four years ago when the
market lost interest in them.

<HEAD>Grains, Soybeans Higher in Wake of Crop Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened sharply higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to the release
Thursday of the latest U.S. Department of Agriculture crop report.
   The report shows that the nation's farmers planted less winter
wheat and harvested less corn and fewer soybeans last fall.
   Farmers planted about 57 million acres of winter wheat for
harvest this year, up 3 percent from the previous crop, according
to the USDA.
   The department estimated the 1989 corn crop at 7.5 billion
bushels and soybean production at 1.9 billion bushels.
   Analysts say the limited rise in winter wheat planting means the
nation's drought-depleted wheat stockpile will remain low. That
could be bullish for wheat futures if the recent dry weather
adversely affected wheat seedlings.
   Corn futures were higher due to strong demand amidst low stocks.
Soybeans were higher despite what analysts called a relatively
neutral USDA report on the crop.
   In early trading, wheat was 1{ cents to 3{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.06\ a bushel; corn was 3}
cents to 4} cents higher with March at $2.43 a bushel; oats were 1
cent to 1{ cents higher with March at $1.44{ a bushel; soybeans
were 1} cents to 4\ cents higher with January at $5.74 cents a
bushel.
   Livestock futures were higher and pork was mixed in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Follow-through buying from Thursday's strong close supported
cattle prices.
   Pork futures were pressured by profit-taking.
   Live cattle were .03 cent to .28 cent higher with February at
77.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .15 cent higher
with January at 84.42 cents a pound; hogs were .07 cent lower to
.18 cent higher with February at 51.20 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .02 cent lower to .23 cent higher with February at
57.55 cents a pound.
   Livestock and pork futures settled higher in Thursday's trading.

<TEXT>
   The Belzbergs, a Canadian family known for
takeover forays, became the latest bidder for Koor Industries on
Friday, offering to purchase Israel's troubled industrial concern
for $130 million.
   Israel radio reported the offer by financier Mark Belzberg
requires the Finance Ministry to provide $50 million it promised
Koor last year to reduce interest debt.
   Koor is owned by the Histadrut, Israel's largest trade unions
federation, and employs 11,000 workers, many of whom oppose a sale
to foreigners.
   However, Koor owes $950 million to creditors abroad. It has
received an extension to pay interest to bondholders until
mid-January. Any offer to purchase Koor has to be approved by the
government and by Koor's creditors.
   An offer to purchase 51 percent of Koor's stocks had been made
earlier by Michael Geiger on behalf of the U.S.-based Shamrock Corp.
   The company reportedly wants the Finance Ministry to guarantee
80 percent of the price it is willing to pay for the ownership of
Koor, and freedom to withdraw from the purchase and receive Israeli
government compensation within five years.
   Israeli media reports say the Finance Ministry prefers the offer
made by the Belzberg family, while Koor leaders favor the Shamrock
one, said to guarantee jobs for the concern's present management.

   The Christmas freeze was even more
devastating to Florida's citrus crop than the freeze of 1983,
federal analysts have confirmed.
   ``It is worse in terms of what we have left to work with,'' said
Bill Becker, chairman of the Florida Citrus Commission. ``In 1983,
we started with a larger crop and salvaged more fruit.''
   The 1989-90 orange harvest, projected before the December cold
wave at only 130 million 90-pound boxes, has now been slashed 29
percent to 92 million boxes, the smallest estimated production
since the 1964-65 season, according to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's monthly crop forecast.
   It was the first USDA monthly report since the Dec. 24-26 freeze
that iced fruit throughout the 700,000-acre citrus belt
   Gov. Bob Martinez on Thursday asked President Bush to declare
disaster areas in seven primarily vegetable-growing counties, and
said he would seek the declaration for more counties once citrus
and sugarcane salvage operations are complete.
   The 1983-84 loss was set at 30 percent, but the forecast had
been 168 million boxes and final production was 116.7 million. The
harvest after the 1985 freeze was 103.9 million boxes of oranges.
   ``We were just getting back on our feet since the last two
freezes,'' said John Smoak, president of Smoak Groves in Lake
Placid.
   USDA analysts said Thursday that the losses to the current crop
may go higher because of heavy spoilage of early and midseason
oranges still being harvested for processing, and indications that
the still immature Valencia variety may have suffered extensive
damage.
   The full extent of the financial damage cannot be calculated for
months, until a full assessment is made of damage to trees,
officials say.
   The state's citrus crop was worth $1.4 billion last season.
   The USDA's monthly crop forecast also estimated that the
grapefruit harvest would be down 14 percent, from 44 million boxes
to 38 million.
   The orange crop last season was 146 million boxes, and the
grapefruit crop was almost 55 million boxes.
   ``This probably will rank as one of the worst freezes of the
century,'' said Robert R. Terry, who heads the citrus section of
the Florida Agricultural Statistics Service.

   The new government said today its
predecessor was wrong to agree to absolve Union Carbide of criminal
liability in the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster, and it called the $470
million settlement inadequate.
   Justice Minister Dinesh Goswami said the 6-week-old government
of Prime Minister V.P. Singh would support gas victims and
activists in Supreme Court petitions challenging the right of
former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's government to settle the case.
However, Goswami did not say whether the government would try to
reopen legal proceedings.
   ``An important point made in the review petitions is that ...
India has no authority or right to arrive at a settlement which
extinguishes all rights of the affected victims in respect of
criminal liability,'' Goswami said at his news conference.
   ``The government is also of the view that human life in India is
not so cheap that the worst industrial disaster of the world ...
could be compensated by an amount of $470 million,'' he added.
   Goswami said the new government would make an interim relief
payment to gas victims from additional funds, but he gave no amount
or number of recipients.
   Robert Berzok, Union Carbide's chief spokesman in Connecticut,
said the company had only seen news reports of the new government's
statements and was unprepared to comment in detail.
   ``All I can tell you is there is no information that suggests
that the assumptions made in ordering the settlement were
incorrect,'' he said.
   The Indian government has said Union Carbide was negligent in
allowing the gas leak to happen. The multinational said the leak
was the result of sabotage by a disgruntled employee.
   On Feb. 15, the Supreme Court accepted the $470 million
settlement from the multinational Union Carbide as ``full and final
compensation'' for the gas leak that killed at least 3,598 people
and injured 20,000 in the central Indian city of Bhopal.
   At the same time, the court ruled the firm based in Danbury,
Conn., was freed from all criminal liability and any future claims
arising from the disaster on Dec. 3, 1984.
   Gas victims and activist groups challenged the settlement,
claiming the Gandhi government had no right to declare itself the
sole representative of all claims arising from the disaster.
   On Dec. 22, the Supreme Court ruled that the government did
indeed have the right to be the claimants' sole representative.
   The Indian government, acting under a 1985 law making it the
sole representative of the Bhopal victims, originally sued Union
Carbide for $3 billion in damages.
   It also filed charges of criminal negligence against top
executives of the U.S.-based Union Carbide Corp. and of its local
subsidiary, Union Carbide of India Ltd. Those charges were
eventually dropped.
   Union Carbide has deposited the full settlement with the court,
but distribution of the money was delayed because of the challenges
and decisions about who is entitled to the money.
   At least 500,000 people have submitted claims, according to
Madhya Pradesh state officials processing the claims in Bhopal, a
city of 1 million. Some claimants lived thousands of miles away but
said they suffered ``mental anguish.''
   Most of the undisputed sufferers are poor shantytown dwellers
who live in mud and burlap huts across the street from the
now-closed Union Carbide plant.
   Many of them inhaled the deadly methyl isocyanate gas as they
slept or fled the choking white cloud that wafted over the teeming
slums.
   Some survivors still suffer from eye and lung problems and say
they no longer have the stamina to hold regular jobs.

   Federal regulators say it may be time to
provide more price regulation for local cable TV operators.
   Virtually all communities with cable TV have had essentially
deregulated systems since 1985 because of a 1984 law that freed
cable systems of rate regulation by local franchisers if there were
three broadcast stations serving the locality.
   But the Federal Communications Commission said Thursday that a
review of ``effective competition'' for cable TV was needed because
of ``changed circumstances in the video marketplace'' and that
cable's market power may have grown substantially since 1984.
   FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes said the inquiry was designed ``to
stimulate a more competitive environment'' in the cable industry
``and provide some assurance, some safeguard, for the public.''
   The FCC said today's cable systems, rather than merely
retransmitting the signals of local stations, offer a wide range of
programming in their lowest-priced ``basic'' service _ and cable
companies are charging more for the service.
   The commission said recent rate hikes indicate cable's market
power may be greater than it was when the three-signal, effective
competition standard was adopted.
   The National Cable Television Association welcomed the new
inquiry. The association said it expected the study ``will
reintroduce a note of reality into the debate over cable rates,
which during 1989 rose at a rate only about half of the overall
Consumer Price Index.''
   Thursday's action was the second major cable regulatory
initiative the FCC has launched in a month as pressure builds to
rein in what cable's harshest critics call an unregulated monopoly.
   On Dec. 12, the commission began a study, as required under the
1984 Cable Act, to determine how the law has affected competition.
   Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., introduced a bill late last year that
would give local authorities the right to regulate cable prices if
there were only one cable provider in the community. Danforth would
also make it easier for cities to revoke a cable franchise if the
operator provides consistently poor service.
   The commission said the new inquiry would consider, among other
questions:
   _Should effective competition be redefined to mean four or more
broadcast stations in a cable market, instead of three?
   _Do cable systems have competition from other systems such as
satellites and microwave systems?
   _Does high cable viewership mean undue market power or indicate,
on the other hand, that a valuable service is being provided?
   _Should viewers be allowed to order cable service on a
per-channel basis?
   The commission also said it would consider reimposing financial
reporting requirements for cable operators that were discontinued
in 1983 and require local authorities to use a specific rate-making
method.
   The commission said it hoped to finish the inquiry by July, when
it said it will report to Congress.
   Among other actions Thursday, the commission proposed easing
application requirements to speed cellular phone service in areas
not being served by a community's two major cellular providers.

   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
497,750 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices for delivery
next month under a long-term grain supply agreement, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said nine private companies shared in
the sales.
   The wheat was sold under the department's Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP, which provides subsidies to exporters selling U.S.
commodities to designated foreign markets.
   Dickerson said 1,036,650 tons of wheat remain in the Soviet
Union's current EEP allocation _ about half of a new purchase line
of 2 million tons was announced on Dec. 19, in addition to 14,200
tons remaining in a previous allocation.
   Only wheat has been approved for sale to the Soviet Union under
the price subsidy program.
   The seventh year of the U.S.-Soviet grain agreement began on
Oct. 1. With the latest sales, the Soviet Union has bought about
1.8 million tons of wheat for 1989-90 delivery and more than 11
million tons of corn, plus some soybeans and soybean meal. All of
the wheat was sold under EEP arrangements.
   In 1988-89, the sixth year of the agreement, the Soviet Union
bought about 5.4 million tons of wheat and more than 16.3 million
tons of corn, plus soybeans, soybean meal and grain sorghums. All
but about 700,000 tons of the wheat was bought under EEP.
   A metric tons is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 497,750 tons are equal to 18.3 million bushels worth
around $69 million at recent U.S. farm prices.
   Dickerson reported the subsidies at an average of $20.67 per
ton, or about 56 cents per bushel.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Dickerson said the latest wheat was sold by Continental Grain
Co., 198,000 tons; Central States Enterprises Inc., 50,000;
Coprostates Inc., 50,000; Tradigrain Inc., 49,750; Harvest States
Cooperatives, 45,000; Cargill Inc., 30,000; Granplex Inc., 25,000;
Louis Dreyfus Corp., 25,000; and Mitsubishi International Corp.,
25,000.

   Sales of U.S. savings bonds totaled $593
million in December, bringing to $7.64 billion the total amount of
sales for the year, the Treasury Department reported Friday.
   The 3 percent increase of sales over calendar 1988 also
increased the amount of bonds held by the public to a record $117.7
billion.
   Saings bonds currently earn interest at a rate of 6.98 percent
when held five years or longer.
   Beginning Jan. 1, the interest may be tax-free if the bonds are
used for education and the interest is no more than tuition and
fees paid to colleges, universities and certain technical schools
during the year of redemption.

<HEAD>Air France Agrees to Buy Controlling Interest in UTA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air France said Friday it has agreed to acquire a
controlling interest in the privately held airline Union de
Transports Aeriens, in a move that values UTA at almost 7 billion
French francs, or around $1.2 billion.
   Air France, the government-owned airline, said it will buy
initially a block of 930,000 UTA shares representing 54.58 percent
of UTA's capital from Chargeurs SA, a holding company with
transportation and textile interests.
   Air France said it will pay 4,083 francs, or $714, for each UTA
share. Trading in UTA shares was suspended on the Paris Stock
Exchange Friday at 2,770 francs, or $484.
   The Societe des Bourses Francaises, which regulates securities
trading, announced the halt amid rumors that Air France would be
purchasing a major stake in UTA, France's biggest private airline.
   Air France said it is offering the same terms to UTA's minority
shareholders.
   Chargeurs controls 82.9 percent of UTA's capital, and Air France
will have first refusal rights if Chargeurs decides on any future
dilution of its stake in UTA.
   UTA has a fleet of only 19 jets, six of which are owned by its
charter subsidiary Aeromaritime. UTA operates on long-haul routes,
mainly to the Pacific and Africa.
   Chargeurs Chairman Jerome Seydoux had said on several occasions
that he would sell UTA if the French government did not authorize
it to operate on European and transatlantic routes.
   In late 1988, the French government rejected UTA's request for
new routes and said it was opposed to allowing UTA to fly to
Newark, N.J., although two years ago UTA won the right to operate
between Paris and San Francisco.
   Air France said the takeover will create an air transport group
that will be able to compete on an even footing with big
international competitors.
   Several of Air France's European rivals, notably British Airways
PLC and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, have considered or made
investments in foreign airlines as a way to position themselves to
exploit the Common Market deregulation set to begin in 1992.
   The deal also gives Air France control of the French domestic
airline Air Inter. UTA holds 35.8 percent of Air Inter stock and
Air France has 37 percent.
   Transport Minister Michel Delebarre issued a statement praising
the deal. But the takeover could spark a political debate, because
Socialist President Francois Mitterrand had promised there would be
neither nationalizations nor privatizations during his current
7-year term.
   As part of the deal, UTA will acquire the 49 percent minority
stake in Aeromaritime that is held by Chargeurs, giving UTA full
control of the charter operation.
   Financial analysts said Air France's purchase of 54.6 percent of
UTA will give Chargeurs an immediate cash injection of almost 3.8
billion francs, or $665 million.
   Chargeurs' 1989 earnings were affected by a strike by UTA pilots
that lasted several months.

   Share prices fell sharply Friday on London's Stock
Exchange under the weight of Tokyo's earlier losses and renewed
worries over Btitish inflation.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index sank 37.8
points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,380.1, its largest single-day loss
since a 38.3-point drop on Nov. 20.
   Volume was 523.4 million shares, down from 578.8 million shares
Thursday but still among the most active sessions in recent weeks.
   Dealers said Tokyo's sharp drop earlier Friday, coupled with
jitters over British inflation, helped accelerate broad-based
selling ahead of the expiration of a two-week trading account
Friday afternoon.
   London's Stock Exchange divides trading into two- and three-week
periods for accounting purposes.
   Some buying emerged when the new account began in the afternoon,
helping push London off the day's lows, but sharp losses on Wall
Street kept aggressive buying in check, London dealers said.

   Disneyland marked a yearlong celebration
of its 35th anniversary with an appearance by former President
Reagan, dozens of dancers and thousands of balloons and of course
the cast of cartoon characters.
   The event was kicked off before a mass of media, with three
participants from the opening-day telecast on July 17, 1955:
Reagan, then a movie actor with a fading career; television emcee
Art Linkletter and actor Robert Cummings.
   Standing before a spangled backdrop Thursday at the Disneyland
railroad station, the former president saluted his late friend,
Walt Disney, and declared, ``Disneyland exemplifies the essence of
the American spirit and continues to show us the way to follow our
dreams.''
   Reagan was part of an extravaganza that included scores of
dancers, singers, as well as Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald
Duck and the rest of the cartoon clan.
   The opening show was followed by a ``Party Gras Parade''
featuring New Orleans-style floats and five-story high balloons of
the Disney characters, including Minnie in a Carmen Miranda
headdress. The parade will continue daily through the anniversary
on July 17.
   Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman and chief executive, presided
over the Disneyland festivities. Eisner is expected to announce
plans for an aggressive 10-year expansion in Anaheim.
   The development has been characterized as Disneyland's first
major expansion since 1972, although Splash Mountain, Star Tours
and other attractions have been added in recent years.
   In an interview following Thursday's events, Eisner was asked
whether there have been complaints about the increase in admission
prices, now $25.50 for adults. Ticket prices have risen 10 times
since 1982.
   ``Certainly we don't want to price ourselves out of a market but
our research shows that the value people are getting today is
greater than last year and the value last year was greater than the
year before,'' he said.
   He added that increases were necessary to continue the high
capital investment required for adding new attractions.
   Disney operates theme parks and resorts in Anaheim, Orlando,
Fla., Tokyo and one under construction in Paris. The Burbank-based
company has pumped an estimated $1.5 billion into its expanding
parks during the past five years.
   Disney's theme parks and resorts constitute the most lucrative
portion of the Magic Kingdom, generating about two-thirds of the
company's operating profits in recent years.
   The parks and resorts accounted for 64 percent of Disney's $1.2
billion in operating profits in 1989.

   Stock prices gave way to widespread selling
today as new inflation worries and market declines in Tokyo and
London set a gloomy mood for Wall Street.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 53.33 points to
2,707.34 by 2 p.m. in New York.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 7 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 196 up,
1,435 down and 313 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of
finished goods rose 0.7 percent in December, exceeding most advance
estimates for that measure of inflationary pressures.
   The index finished 1989 with an increase of 4.8 percent, its
biggest in eight years.
   Analysts said the news dealt an abrupt setback to hopes on Wall
Street for any further moves soon by the Federal Reserve to relax
its credit policy and encourage lower interest rates.
   Stock traders also were absorbing word of overnight declines in
the Japanese and British markets, where interest-rate and inflation
worries have also been weighing down enthusiasm lately.
   Among the blue chips, General Electric dropped 1&lsqb; to 63|; Exxon
1 to 48; International Business Machines 1 to 98~; Coca-Cola 1~ to
74}, and Philip Morris ~ to 39&lsqb;.
   Philips Industries fell 2\ to 15}. Late Thursday a management
group that had been planning a $24-a-share buyout of the company
said it dropped the bid after failing to get financing for it.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
3.25 to 189.53. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 5.07 at 374.28.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 128.14 million shares with two
hours to go.

<TEXT>
   The predictions of doom date to the start of
Robert Campeau's attempt to build an American retailing empire, and
the prospects of its loss caused little mourning Friday among
Canadians who long have said they told him so.
   The flamboyant Campeau was a celebrity among Canadian
businessmen in the United States, the poor boy from decidedly
unglamorous Sudbury, Ontario, who made his Canadian fortune in real
estate and then bought the parent of New York-based Bloomingdale's
as the crown jewel of his new retailing strategy.
   The $6.6 billion takeover of Federated Department Stores Inc. in
April 1988 was the biggest Canadian acquisition ever in the United
States. It followed Campeau's 1986 acquisition of New York-based
Allied Stores Corp. for $3.6 billion.
   On Thursday night, the directors of Campeau Corp. announced they
planned to give up control of their U.S. retailing operations,
which are struggling to regroup under the mountain of debt incurred
when Campeau bought them.
   Robert Campeau said he would be involved only in the company's
real estate operations, removing himself from leadership of the 260
U.S. department stores.
   Campeau's fall has not generated much evident sympathy in his
native country.
   Canadians frequently tend to view with a certain amount of
skepticism their countrymen who succeed too well, especially if
they make too much noise about it.
   ``It gave me a great feeling as a Canadian to reverse the fact
Americans have always bought a great deal of Canada,'' Campeau said
in an interview with the Toronto Star at the time of the Federated
takeover. ``Canada is still my favorite country. It's not Canada's
fault we have messed it up.''
   Harold Crookell, a professor at the University of Western
Ontario's business school, said Canadians seem to have less
patience than Americans for the ``Donald Trump syndrome'' of
flaunting wealth and power.
   ``Americans tend to laugh it off, but Canadians see that as
threatening to the poor, threatening to those in need,'' Crookell
said in a phone interview. ``There is a somewhat more egalitarian
feeling in Canada than the United States.''
   But, he said, ``I don't think anyone particularly has strong
positive emotions toward the multimillionaires in life. I don't
know that Canada is unique.''
   Financial analysts suggested for some time that Campeau paid too
much for Federated, and the extent of his difficulties surfaced in
September when Bloomingdale's was put up for sale.
   Canadian Business magazine dropped Campeau from 12th to 36th
place on its annual ``power list'' of the nation's business leaders
last fall after he started relinquishing control of the corporation
and allowed a restructuring committee to take control of solving
the financial crisis.
   Toronto, Canada's business center, has a notably
English-Canadian traditional elite. Campeau, a French-Canadian with
an eighth-grade education, moved here after spectacular success in
real estate in Ottawa, the federal capital.
   Despite his 11,000-square foot mansion at Toronto's most
prestigious address, he never lost his image as an outsider.
Campeau complained about it, in what some said was a form of
boasting.
   Yet the plans announced Thursday night apparently intended to
separate the U.S. division from the Toronto-based parent let
Campeau retain a role in Canadian business, and few people of
influence here are willing to speak publicly about him.
   Memories linger of his 1980 clash with the WASP elite of Bay
Street, Canada's Wall Street, which blocked him from taking over
the financial institution Royal Trustco Ltd. Campeau then went on
to seek bigger targets in the United States.
   ``I tend to think that privately they are (gloating),'' Michael
Babad, co-author of a book published in Canada last fall about
Campeau, said Friday. ``He caused them a lot of trouble in 1980.''
   Campeau came back from that and other setbacks, leading to
speculation that even the serious difficulties on his biggest deal
might not be his finale.
   ``If anyone can bounce back, it's Bob Campeau, because his
history has always shown that he can,'' Babad said in an interview.
   Canadian investment has increased sharply in the United States
and is expected to grow more under the free trade agreement that
took effect a year ago. Major successes can be tracked in real
estate, communications and other areas, but Campeau's difficulty is
only the latest and biggest in a series of Canadian misadventures
in American retailing.
   For example, Imasco Ltd. of Montreal had problems with the
Peoples Drug Store chain in the United States and Toronto-based
Canadian Tire ran into difficulty with an auto stores investment in
the southwestern United States.

<HEAD>Citing New York Crime, Sock Shop Is Moving to the Suburbs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sock Shop International PLC, the British retailer
that recently closed its 14 New York stores, on Friday blamed high
security costs caused by drug-related crime, and said it would seek
to reopen stores in safer malls instead.
   ``The outlets have experienced increasing difficulties due, in
particular, to drug-related crime in New York which has
necessitated substantial security costs,'' the company said.
   It also cited a deteriorating retail environment and continuing
high rents in the New York market.
   Sock Shop said it it negotiating with a third party over what it
called ``selective reopenings'' of its U.S. outlets in ``secure
regional malls.''
   It also said it was seeking a partner that would take a
controlling stake in the U.S. operation.
   Sock Shop also said it was in talks that might lead to a
refinancing of Sock Shop, which would be used to cut debt and
bolster expansion in Europe. It didn't elaborate.
   It added that the restructuring of the U.S. operations will
result in an extraordinary charge for the year. It didn't specify
the amount.
   ``Although it is encouraging to note that the core U.K. business
traded well before Christmas, trading suffered during 1989 as a
result of a combination of high interest rates, record hot weather
and the (British) train and tube (subway) strikes,'' Sock Shop said.
   Sock Shop confirmed Dec. 29 that two days earlier it had closed
its 17 U.S. stores, three of which are located in New Jersey and
Pennsylvania.
   Sock Shop operates 105 stores in Britain and 15 in continental
Europe.

<TEXT>
   President Bush complained to a business group
today that key parts of his legislative agenda remain ``bogged down
in the jungles of Capitol Hill.''
   ``The clock is running. America's patience is running out,'' the
president told the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce.
   Bush complained that the Democratic-controlled Congress was
dragging its feet on his plans to lower capital gains taxes, beef
up education programs, strengthen clean-air regulations and fight
crime.
   The audience of several hundred applauded vigorously when he
mentioned his proposal to cut capital gains taxes. Bush also said
he would not allow reduced military tensions because of changes in
Eastern Europe be an excuse ``to naively cut the muscle out of our
defense posture.''
   The president did not mention a dispute with Democrats over a
proposal by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., to lower Social
Security taxes _ a plan gaining support among conservative and
business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   ``On Capitol Hill some important business remains unfinished,
promises have gone unfilled,'' he said, claiming his agenda was
``bogged down in the jungles of Capital Hill.''
   Earlier, Bush told students at a Cincinnati high school he was
optimistic about the future. But he said federal resources to give
more to education were limited.
   In a question-and-answer session in the library of Taft High
School, the president said budget restraints would prevent him from
proposing large increases in federal aid.
   However, he said he would call for some increases in overall
school spending when he presents his fiscal 1991 budget to Congress
on Jan. 23, including expanding the Head Start program fo0r
disadvantaged pre-school children.
   But, the president added, ``I don't think you can design a
curriculum to lift the self-esteem of a kid. It's got to come from
peers, from family, from dedicated volunteers _ who are saying,
`You are somebody.'''
   Bush also met with members of the Cincinnati Youth
Collaborative, a volunteer organization that tutors children and
tries to keep students from dropping out of school.
   In a speech to a school assembly, he announced he was awarding
the Collaborative his 40th daily ``Point of Light'' award, an honor
he bestows on organizations and individuals that best exemplifying
his ``thousand points of light'' theme.
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been a longtime Bush ally on
the capital gains cut. But the group said Thursday that it would
also welcome lower Social Security taxes _ despite the president's
objections.
   Don Levin, director of federal budget policy for the national
business organization, called the Moynihan proposal ``a positive
first step'' toward strengthening the Social Security system.
   Although the chamber has concerns about paying for such a tax
cut, Levin said the administration and ``Republicans in general''
would be ``missing a golden opportunity'' by not backing it.
   ``How can you go against such a good idea? It's a populist idea.
And it will do a lot of good for economic growth,'' Levin said.
   On Thursday, Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was asked about the
Moynihan proposal _ in light of Bush's repeated opposition to
higher taxes.
   ``We don't anticipate any changes in Social Security. Democrats
seem to want to fiddle around with the Social Security system; we
do not,'' Fitzwater said.
   Moynihan would cancel the Jan. 1 increase that raised the Social
Security tax rate to 7.65 percent from 7.51 percent. The tax covers
both retirement and Medicare programs.
   The rate would then decrease even further, to 6.55 percent, on
Jan. 1, 1991. Moynihan says large surpluses in the Social Security
trust funds justify the rollback, which he calls a ``$55 billion
tax cut for working people.''
   Moynihan's proposal would reduce the rate paid by both employees
and employers.
   Social Security taxes jumped this year by as much as $320 _ the
increase paid by Americans with salaries of $51,300 or more. At
$48,000 and below, the increase is 0.14 percent, or $67 for someone
earning $48,000; $42 for someone earning $30,000, $28 for someone
earning $20,000, and so on.
   Ed Lopez, an aide to Moynihan, said the senator intends to
introduce the legislation Jan. 23, when Congress returns from its
winter recess. He said the measure is picking up wide support.
   ``We expected it would have bipartisan support. But it's a bit
surprising, the extent to which the right wing has climbed all over
it,'' Lopez said.
   Increases this year and next in Social Security taxes were
mandated by 1983 legislation that carried out recommendations of a
blue-ribbon commission headed by Alan Greenspan to overhaul the
financing of the nation's retirement program.
   There is about a $65 billion surplus in Social Security trust
funds. This surplus _ kept in Treasury securities _ tends to mask
the size of the true U.S. budget deficit, making it easier for the
administration to meet deficit-reducing targets of the Gramm-Rudman
budget balancing law.

   The prestigious Porsche enters its 42nd year
feeling a twinge of midlife crisis.
   The 1987 stock market crash that alarmed affluent buyers, the
dollar's weakness against the German mark and increased competition
cut into sales of the pricey ground-hugging roadster, prompting the
company to trim production in Germany and slash exports to the
United States.
   In response to the cutbacks, Reno-based Porsche Cars of North
America, Inc., has begun what it calls a unique campaign to inflame
the desire of would-be Porsche owners.
   ``Porsche is still very much a car of aspiration. We're trying
to renew that interest,'' said David W. Wager, vice president and
director of marketing for Porsche Cars of North America.
   ``This company really produces nothing. Our function is sales
and marketing. We wanted a piece of creativity that would be really
different, get people involved,'' he said.
   The result was six-page booklets inserted in 16 national
magazines including The New Yorker, Forbes, Yachting and Esquire
and two-minute television commercials.
   The campaign underscores the car's handling and reliability in
auto racing and the research and development that go into the
finished product.
   Many of the words in the brochures and commercials are those of
80-year-old Ferdinand ``Ferry'' Porsche, who in 1948 developed the
car that bears his name.
   ``If I build a car that gives me satisfaction, then there must
be others with the same sort of dreams who would be prepared to buy
such a car,'' he says. ``The Porsche ... is simply more than an
automobile; it embodies my philosophy of freedom of individual
progression, serving mankind without burdening it.''
   The television commercials also center on what Porsche calls the
philosophy of independence and timelessness that go into its cars,
which range in price from $42,000 to $75,000.
   The company opted for the unusually long commercials ``produced
like a piece of cinema'' so they would not look like other
commercials, said Brian Bowler, president and chief executive
officer of Porsche Cars of North America.
   ``Our customers are increasingly entrepreneurial. That ties in
because Porsche is the product of Ferry Porsche, an entrepreneur
himself,'' Wager said.
   ``In reality, part of the rationale for doing this kind of
campaign is not just to reach the target audience. Even the ones
who cannot afford it now will dream and aspire to want to own a
Porsche as well,'' he said.
   In 1986, Porsche shipped about two-thirds of its 45,000 cars to
the United States.
   Since the stock crash of 1987 and the decline of the dollar
against the mark, Porsche has trimmed overall production to
30,000-40,000 cars a year, exporting about one-third of those to
Porsche NA.
   ``I suppose our U.S. sales are going to be in the 11,000-12,000
range for the next couple of years. We'd like eventually to move
sales up a little closer to 15,000, but that's not going to come
any time soon,'' Wager said.
   Bowler and Wager brought an extensive marketing background to
Porsche. Bowler joined the company in December 1988 after 21 years'
association with Volkswagen in Europe and America. Wager's resume
includes work with Subaru and Saab-Scandia before moving to Reno in
March.
   Wager said he and Bowler immediately decided on a dramatic
change in the company's direction focusing on sales and marketing.
   ``Advertising is consistency of message ... to change somebody's
thought patterns or processes,'' he said. ``We think we're in real
danger of doing some pretty good advertising.''

<HEAD>Stage Set For Joint Ventures, Price Hikes Announced</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY CZUCZKA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's parliament on Friday cleared
the way for joint ventures with Western companies for the first
time, although officials said foreigners generally would be limited
to minority shareholdings.
   In a near-unanimous vote, the 500-seat People's Chamber passed a
constitutional revision needed to allow private ownership,
including foreign shareholdings, of East German companies.
   The government also announced price hikes for several items, to
foil foreign bargain seekers and start cutting state supports that
the strapped economy can't afford.
   Government officials said foreign ownership would be limited to
49 percent to avoid a sellout of the country's industry, but that
foreign companies could buy controlling stakes under special
circumstances.
   The Communist-led government plans to approve a detailed
proposal on joint ventures on Jan. 25 and submit it to parliament
in October.
   East Germany has been seeking injections of foreign capital to
modernize its stalling economy. Foreign companies, especially West
German interests, have expressed keen interest in moving into the
new market.
   Economics Minister Christa Luft told parliament that the
constitutional change paves the way for new forms of property in
East Germany.
   But, she said, ``It does not change the domination of public
ownership of the key means of production.''
   Finance Minister Uta Nickel told her West German counterpart
Theo Waigel at a meeting in East Berlin that foreigners might be
allowed at some point to hold a majority stake in certain ventures.
   Waigel, who also met with East German Prime Minister Hans
Modrow, urged East Germany to permit majority ownership if it wants
private West German capital to flow in on a large scale.
   The East German government announced it will raise prices for
children's clothes and shoes Monday to prevent major buying by
foreigners. The hikes will be matched by a rise in state child
support payments, the government said.
   Prices of children's items have been kept extremely cheap with
government subsidies and were favored especially by bargain-seeking
Polish buyers.
   Conversely, the government ordered price cuts for sheer
stockings, saying production was efficient enough to allow the move.
   Subsidies were eliminated for flowers, Christmas trees and
household plants. The subsidies were a symbol of often wasteful
state support of prices.

   Stock prices took a steep drop today as new
inflation worries and market declines in Tokyo and London set a
gloomy mood for Wall Street.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 66.56 points to
2,694.11 by 3 p.m. in New York. That marked the average's worst
one-day showing since the 190.58 ``mini-crash'' last Oct. 13.
   Losers overwhelmed gainers by more than 7 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 190 up,
1,490 down and 290 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of
finished goods rose 0.7 percent in December, exceeding advance
estimates for that measure of inflationary pressures.
   The index finished 1989 with an increase of 4.8 percent, its
biggest in eight years.
   Analysts said the news dealt an abrupt setback to hopes on Wall
Street for any further moves soon by the Federal Reserve to relax
its credit policy and encourage lower interest rates.
   Stock traders also were absorbing word of overnight declines in
the Japanese and British markets, where interest-rate and inflation
worries have also been unsettled investors lately.
   Tightening credit conditions overseas have raised fears that the
U.S. Treasury will have to pay higher interest rates to attract
buyers for its securities.

   Grain futures prices closed mixed and soybeans
were lower Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade as investors
reacted to the release of an Agriculture Department crop report.
   The report, released Thursday, showed that the nation's farmers
planted less winter wheat and harvested less corn and fewer
soybeans last fall.
   Farmers planted about 57 million acres of winter wheat for
harvest this year, up 3 percent from the previous crop, according
to the USDA. The department estimated the 1989 corn crop at 7.5
billion bushels and soybean production at 1.9 billion bushels.
   Soybeans were sharply higher at the open, but fell back because
of weak cash prices and very good growing conditions in South
America.
   Analyst William Biedermann of Allendale Inc. in Chicago said the
USDA report on soybeans was ``neutral to friendly, adding that
traders hoped soybeans were rise on the backs of corn and wheat.
   The smaller than expected corn harvest proved to be a boost to
corn futures.
   The reduced number of seedings sent wheat futures higher at the
open, but only the July new-crop contract sustained its advance due
to somewhat dry condition in pockets of the winter wheat crop area.
   At the close, wheat was 2{ cents lower to a { cent higher with
March at $4.02 a bushel; corn was 3{ cents to 4\ cents higher with
March at $2.42 a bushel; oats were } cent lower to a \ cent higher

<HEAD>$31 Million Earthquake Loan to China Considered</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Bank said Friday it is considering a
$31 million loan to help China repair earthquake damage in what
would be the first aid by the bank since last year's democracy
movement crackdown.
   World Bank spokesman William Brannigan said the group's
president, Barber Conable, would decide within the next 10 days
whether to send the loan to the bank's executive directors for
consideration.
   The bank is owned by 152 countries, with the U.S. government
holding the largest voting power, 18 percent. White House spokesman
Roman Popadiuk said earlier this week the bank would consider loans
to China on a case-by-case basis.
   Conable suspended consideration of $780 million in loans to
China in June, four days after tanks crushed a student-led
uprising. Disbursements continued on loans granted earlier.
   Conable has said that loans are granted only on economic grunds
and he hoped to resume lending to China soon.
   The New China News Agency reported that 29 people were killed
near the border between Shanxi and Hebei provinces in northern
China in an earthquake Oct. 18 and 5,000 to 8,000 houses destroyed.
The area is about 135 miles west of Beijing.
   The earthquake loan is separate from those suspended in June. It
would be issued by the bank's International Development
Association, which waits 40 years for repayment and charges nominal
interest. The United States contributes 22 percent of its funds.
   Brannigan said the China loan would not be considered at an
executive board meeting scheduled for Tuesday but could be
discussed at the following meeting, on Jan. 30.

<HEAD>Tonkin Reluctantly Ends Year As Dealers' President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year ago the folks at automakers who deal with
dealers tightened their seat belts. Ron Tonkin was on the way.
   After a year of rebuking manufacturers for handcuffing dealers
with too many rebates, mandatory advertising and subsidies, Tonkin
is concluding his term as head of the National Automobile Dealers
Association.
   He doesn't want to go.
   ``I'm not ready yet,'' said Tonkin, who owns several dealerships
in his hometown of Portland, Ore. and elsewhere. ``The job just
isn't done. That's my frustration.''
   Tonkin may feel his chores are unfinished, but automakers and
dealers acknowledge that manufacturer-retailer relationships
changed during his tenure as president of the association.
   ``He's certainly succeeded in bringing the level of awareness of
dealer concerns up a notch or two,'' Chrysler Corp. marketing Vice
President John Damoose said. ``Frankly, that's good.''
   Today's relationship can be called adversarial.
   ``It is not a partnership,'' Tonkin said in a recent interview.
``Whatever may have once been a partnership unraveled long before
my time.''
   Tonkin said he hopes his blunt attitude continues when Ray Green
of Jacksonville, Ill., takes over the presidency at the
organization's annual convention next month in Las Vegas.
   Tonkin got off to a fast start as association president. On the
day he was installed in New Orleans, he formed the ``Rough
Riders,'' a group of 2,000 dealers assigned to scrutinize
manufacturers like watchdogs.
   ``I'm more proud of the Rough Riders than anything else,''
Tonkin said. ``They alert us to anything that we should be
addressing on behalf of the dealers. That's been accomplished.''
   Other problems Tonkin saw when he took office remain. Among them:
   _Rebates. Tonkin said cash-back offers cripple dealers' chances
to bargain with customers and erode the dealer's profit margin and
the consumer's chance to get a car at the best price.
   ``Not only the dealers, but the public is sick and tired of
playing the games,'' he said.
   _Mandatory advertising associations. Tonkin decried automakers
for imposing a system that required dealers to pay for regional
advertising. BMW recently dropped the requirement of its dealers,
who were paying $300 a car into advertising associations.
   ``That was a small victory for us at NADA, but it is a
victory,'' Tonkin said.
   _Fleet subsidies. Dealers handling large fleet sales to
corporations or rental car companies, for example, get subsidies
from automakers because of the large orders. Tonkin claimed the
manufacturers recover those costs by tacking hundreds of dollars
onto the price of every new car.
   ``We haven't broken their will to maintain their fleet
subsidies, but we're having some dialogue,'' he said.
   Tonkin said he thinks his successor and others will ``keep the
automakers' feet to the fire.'' Otherwise, he said he'll run again.
   On Feb. 1, less than two weeks before he leaves office, Tonkin
will address the board of directors of Chrysler Corp., the first
dealer association president to directly meet with a Big Three
board.
   Tonkin said he thinks the automakers will be seeing a lot of the
NADA in the years to come.
   ``I think Ray will end up being a very effective president,'' he
said. ``And I think we have a very effective man following Ray
(Frank Anderson of Raleigh, N.C., in 1991). And if I don't think
they're effective, then I'll run again.
   ``And in three years, (manufacturers) will have to look at me in
Detroit again. The automakers don't want that. So they sure better
get along with these two.''

<HEAD>Ford Selling Aerospace Subsidiary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. said Friday it plans to sell its
Ford Aerospace Corp. subsidiary and concentrate on its core
businesses, attempting to divest the defense contractor at a time
the Pentagon is eyeing major spending cuts.
   The decision to sell Ford Aerospace, a 17,000-worker operation
that gets about two-thirds of its business from defense contracts,
marks the second recent move by a Big Three automaker to sell a
major non-automotive subsidiary.
   Chrysler Corp. put its Chrysler Technologies Corp., including
Gulfstream Aerospace Inc., up for sale last month, stating it
wanted to concentrate on businesses linked directly to cars and
trucks.
   ``The decision to sell Ford Aerospace reflects the intention to
concentrate our resources on our other businesses,'' Ford Chairman
Donald Petersen said in a news release.
   Ford Aerospace is involved primarily in space- and ground-based
command, control, communications and intelligence systems; tactical
weapons systems and professional services.
   Ford Aerospace built the Johnson Space Center Mission Control
Center in Houston, first used for the 1969 Moon landing. It also
built the Mariner IV satellite which sent the first fly-by pictures
of Mars back to Earth.
   Currently, the 34-year-old company is involved in building the
INTELSAT VII, a communications satellite commissioned by a
consortium of nations.
   ``I think the philosophy of the business community today is that
business strategies should be deeper and narrower than they were
during the conglomerate days because it's very difficult for
management to stay close to a diverse group of businesses,'' said
Ford spokesman Bill Peacock.
   ``Automotive and financial services is our heritage,'' he said.
``They require lots of resources to remain competitive in the sense
of capital, management attention and so forth.''
   Analysts said Ford may have to seek a lower price for the
subsidiary than it might have a few months ago, before East-West
tensions began easing dramatically and the government began talking
about substantial cuts in defense spending.
   Sixty-six percent of Ford Aerospace's business last year came
from defense contracts, 15 percent in international business, 14
percent in civilian government contracts and the rest in U.S.
commercial operations, said spokesman Norman Black.
   Ford declines to reveal earnings of the subsidiary, but said
Ford Aerospace signed $1.83 billion worth of contracts last year
and that it has a $2 billion backlog, some of which is included in
new 1989 contracts.
   Ford Aerospace has three large units: the Aeronutronics Division
in Newport Beach, Calif., which builds tactical weapons systems; a
commercial communications satellite and telemetry systems division
in Palo Alto and Sunnyvale, Calif.; and BDM Inc., a Washington,
D.C.-area defense consulting and engineering organization.
   Lawrence Harris, an aerospace analyst with the Bateman, Eichler,
Hill Richards brokerage in Los Angeles, speculated the company
might be sold in parts because the operations are so different.
   Harris speculated that Ford Aerospace had about $1.7 billion in
revenue last year. Using an aerospace industry rule of thumb that
properties sell for 70 percent to 75 percent of revenue, he
estimated Ford Aerospace might fetch $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion
in its entirety.
   ``But that all depends on profits, and there's no profit data
here,'' he said.
   Ford still retains a large non-automotive operation _ First
Nationwide Bank based in San Francisco.
   While Chrysler is attempting to sell Chrysler Technologies,
there have been no indications the biggest of the Big Three,
General Motors Corp., wants to sell its aerospace business.
   GM owns Hughes Aircraft Co. as part of its GM-Hughes Electronics
Corp. subsidiary.
   Much of GM-Hughes Electronics' profits are tied up in automotive
business. In 1988, the latest annual figures available, GM-Hughes
made $160.2 million on its defense business and $618.7 million in
its automotive operations.
   Ford Aerospace dates to the creation of Ford's Aeronutronic
Division in 1956, which was expanded with the acquisition of Philco
Corp. in 1961. It acquired BDM International Inc. in 1988.
   Ford Aerospace is based in Newport Beach, Calif., and has most
of its operations in Colorado, Pennsylvania, Texas, California and
the Washington, D.C., area.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Higher at Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wave of uncertainty over Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's political future pushed the dollar mostly
higher in domestic dealings Friday, overshadowing two bearish
reports on the U.S. economy.
   Gold prices generally rose. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a late bid price of $414.50, up 90 cents an ounce. On New
York's Commodity Exchange, however, gold bullion for current
delivery slipped 80 cents a troy ounce to $413.20.
   The dollar took a hit overseas and traded sharply lower in
domestic dealings following negative reports on U.S. inflation and
retail sales.
   But late in the session, traders said talk that Gorbachev may
not survive the intenese political pressure surrounding Lithuanian
demands for secession pushed the dollar higher.
   During a trip to Lithuania, Gorbachev promised a referendum on a
law that would require republics to hold their own votes on
breaking away, but currency traders said there were rumors he was
not supported by Moscow.
   ``The speculation is that Gorbachev is not dealing from a large
power base anymore,'' said Kevin Lawrie, a vice president at the
Bank of Boston's New York office.
   ``And when in doubt, buy the buck,'' he said, referring to the
dollar as the ``safe-haven'' currency during times of political
instability.
   Despite the uncertainty, Marc Chandler, an analyst with
Chicago-based Money Market Services International, stressed that
``the economic fundamentals continue to work against the dollar.''
   Indeed, the Labor Department reported wholesale prices rose by a
higher-than-expected 0.7 percent in December, boosting 1989
inflation to 4.8 percent for the worst annual showing in eight
years. Separately, the government said retail sales edged by just
0.2 percent in December after rising 0.5 percent in November.
   The reports, which point jointly to higher inflation and an
economic slowdown, initially rocked the dollar and took their toll
on stock prices, pushing the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
down by more than 71 points at the closing bell.
   The financial markets interpreted the reports as a sign the
Federal Reserve would not lower interest rates in the near future.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 145.35 Japanese yen, up from
145.27. Later in London, the dollar closed higher at 145.40 yen. In
New York, the dollar finished at 145.74 yen, up from 145.45 yen on
Thursday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6705 late Friday, more
expensive for buyers than Thursday's late $1.6575. In New York, it
cost $1.6610 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.6598 on
Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's
late rates included: 1.6860 West German marks, up from 1.6795;
1.4975 Swiss francs, down from 1.5065; 5.7410 French francs, up
from 5.7215; 1,256.00 Italian lire, up 1,253.75; and 1.1573
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1563.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Thursday's late
rates included: 1.6785 West German marks, down from 1.6800; 1.4940
Swiss francs, down from 1.5210; 5.7155 French francs, down from
5.7325; 1.8870 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9021; 1,252.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,258.50; and 1.1560 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1575.
   Gold prices ended the week at a bid $416.25 a troy ounce in
London and $416.75 dollars in Zurich, a $4-an-ounce rise in both
centers. Dealers said trading was active. Earlier in Hong Kong gold
closed at $414.35 a troy ounce, up from $411.75.
   Silver prices rose. On New York's Comex, silver for current
delivery finished at $5.330 a troy ounce, up from $5.306 on
Thursday. In London the metal traded at a late bid price of $5.36 a
troy ounce, up from $5.34.

   Adolph Coors Co. on Friday announced record
beer sales for fiscal 1989, including a 15 percent increase in

   For the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, the company's Coors Brewing

record, increasing 32 percent to 4.4 million barrels compared to
the same quarter a year earlier.
   ``We are delighted with the strong performance of our brands in
1989, particularly Coors Light, which surpassed the
10-million-barrel mark before year-end,'' said Coors Brewing Co.
President Peter H. Coors.
   ``This phenomenal growth of more than 15 percent made Coors
Light the fastest growing premium light beer in America last year,
and all indicators suggest that this trend continues.''
   Coors said the company also was encouraged by the fourth-quarter
sales performance of its new Keystone and Keystone Light brands.
   Despite the strong sales results, Coors said, the company
expects ``intense price competition and higher packaging costs in
the beer industry to place continued pressure on earnings.''

   Continental Airlines is laying off about 150
workers nationwide in what the carrier is calling a belt-tightening
program.
   The layoffs, which began Tuesday, involve administrative
employees but no passenger service workers, said Art Kent, a
spokesman for Continental's parent Texas Air Corp.
   ``There were no pilots, no stewardesses, no gate agents and
certainly no mechanics,'' he said Thursday.
   ``The whole point was to get more cost-efficient. We have
reached the point where it is obvious to us we are too fat in the
middle. The restructuring is minimal, less than one-half of 1
percent of the total workforce were furloughed.''
   The airline employs about 35,000 people, including 11,000 in
Houston.
   ``I suppose the number is really so small compared with the size
of our company,'' Kent said. ``We didn't think it was significant
enough that we make a public announcement about it.''
   Continental's sister carrier, Eastern Airlines, has been
restructured as a smaller airline in the wake of a crippling strike
that started last March 4. Eastern has about 20,000 employees,
mostly non-union replacement workers, down from 32,000 before the
strike.

   General Motors Corp. said Friday it will offer
early retirement incentives, limit new hiring and reduce
advertising spending in a sweeping cost-cutting plan tied to an
industry slump.
   The program has no target or deadline, spokesman Terry Sullivan
said. It is separate from GM's ``Action Plan'' of 1987 that aims to
slash up to $13 billion in costs by the end of this year.
   ``Because of the increasing competitive nature of the automotive
industry, we are intensifying our cost-reduction activities
throughout General Motors,'' he said.
   The new cost-cutting is another sign of concern about the
industry conditions. Car and truck sales have been slumping since
October, when the 1990 model year began, and officials believe the
downturn will last through the first half of the year.
   ``I think it's a classic reaction to structural change in the
industry,'' said auto analyst John Kirnan of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
in New York, referring to recent moves to trim costs and
concentrate on car- and truck-making.
   GM, along with its Big Three cousins Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp., on Thursday announced temporary plant closings for later
this month and into February that will idle 58,600 employees for at
least a week.
   The shutdowns resulted from swelling inventories of new cars and
slow sales.
   No. 3 Chrysler Corp. is trying to trim at least $1 billion from
its $26-billion annual budget by the end of 1990. Ford Motor Co.
has no formal cost-cutting program, but spokesman Tom Foote said
the automaker is examining expenses and eliminating redundancies
and excess.
   GM already has cut more than $11 billion under its
cost-reduction plan, Sullivan said.
   Under the new plan, some employees younger than 53 will be
offered bonuses to quit between March 1 and June 30. Older workers
will be offered early retirement packages between April 1 and Sept.
30, spokeswoman Patricia Malloy said.
   Hiring will be limited to about 500 recent college graduates in
technical fields during the first half of the year, she said. In
1989, GM hired about 1,700 college graduates and a smaller number
of other workers, Malloy said.
   ``Right now, it looks as if our recruiting on college campuses
this year will definitely be more limited than it was last year,''
she said.
   GM, the world's largest automaker, currently has 107,000
salaried and 345,500 hourly workers in the United States and
Canada. It has about 33,000 salaried employees overseas.
   Malloy said either the company or an employee could refuse or
accept the early buyouts.
   Advertising spending this year is likely to be lower than last
year, GM said, but like other automakers, it declind to release
advertising figures.
   Sullivan said nothing is exempt in the latest cost-cutting wave,
but some essential new-product programs will feel the sting less.
He denied a report in The Wall Street Journal on Friday that GM
hopes to make $1 billion worth of cuts.
   ``We are re-emphasizing the activities and programs that are
critical to the future competiveness of General Motors,'' he said.
``That's to go in and make sure that they stay in existence.''
   But he added: ``I'm not saying there are no product programs
that aren't being affected.''
   The bulk of the cuts are expected to be made in North America,
where GM does most of its business. Company profits have been
buoyed by overseas earnings, principally in Europe.
   The company declines to separate its North American earnings
figures, but analysts speculated GM lost money in North America
during the third quarter of last year.

   Soaring energy costs pushed wholesale prices
up 0.7 percent in December, bringing inflation in 1989 to an
eight-year high of 4.8 percent, the government said Friday.
   The sharp, seasonally adjusted monthly rise helped spook
financial markets, which read it as a sign the Federal Reserve
Board would not lower interest rates anytime soon.
   Markets also were reacting to stock plunges earlier in London
and Tokyo. By the close of trading, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks had tumbled 71.46 points to 2,689.21.
   In a separate report, the Commerce Department said retail sales
in December rose a lackluster, seasonally-adjusted 0.2 percent. For
the year, sales rose 5 percent, a seven-year low and barely
outpacing inflation.
   ``We're starting the year with the worst of both possible
worlds: inflation accelerating and growth slowing,'' said economist
David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co. Inc., a government
securities dealer in New York.
   The 1989 gain in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index for
finished goods, one stop short of retail, topped the previous
year's rate of 4 percent and was more than double the 1987 pace of
2.2 percent.
   It marked the third consecutive acceleration of wholesale
inflation and was the steepest rise since a 7.1 percent rise in
1981.
   The primary factor driving prices higher in December and for all
of 1989 was energy, which climbed 1.4 percent for the month and 9.6
percent for the year.
   The deep freeze over much of the nation last month helped boost
fuel oil prices 7.1 percent and natural gas costs 1.6 percent.
Gasoline prices were unchanged after falling 7.7 percent in
November.
   For the year, fuel oil climbed 33.9 percent, the biggest jump
since 1979. Gasoline rose 9.2 percent and natural gas, 3.5 percent.
   Analysts foresee energy prices increasing substantially again
this month, and perhaps in February, but then subsiding with warmer
temperatures in the spring.
   Economist Robert G. Dederick, of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago,
said prices also might retreat if the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries did not cut back on its recent, heavy
production.
   Food inflation rose at a 5 percent annual pace compared with 5.7
percent in 1988, when a summer drought seared the nation's
midsection.
   Egg prices rose 40.9 percent, on top of a 42.1 percent increase
in 1988; pork prices jumped 19.4 percent and dairy products 14.3
percent. However, fresh fruit declined 10.4 percent; chicken 8.9
percent; and fish 5.7 percent.
   December food prices, which rose a moderate 0.5 percent, did not
reflect the full force of the cold snap. Vegetable prices shot up
4.1 percent, but fruit prices fell 1.7 percent.
   ``Watch out for next month,'' said economist Stacy Kottman of
Georgia State University. ``This is not a pretty report but it will
look better than what we think is hitting us in January.''
   The inflation rate excluding the volatile food and energy
sectors, viewed as a good indicator of underlying inflation
pressures, shot up 0.6 percent last month.
   But much of that was attributed to a 4.5 percent jump in tobacco
prices. Auto prices rose a brisk 0.6 percent, but for the year were
up only 2.1 percent because of weak sales.
   Prices excluding food and energy rose 4.2 percent in 1989, down
slightly from 4.3 percent in 1988.
   Economists attribute this stability to the policies of the
Federal Reserve Board, which slowed the economy with higher
interest rates until June. Since then, the central bank has been
allowing rates to fall in an effort to prevent a recession.
   However, the credit easing moves have been made cautiously and
usually not while inflation signs were evident.
   Most analysts expect economic sluggishness to persist well into
the first half of this year, taking the edge off prices for many
goods and commodities and offsetting problems in energy and food.
   ``After a first quarter food and energy bubble, I think you can
find some hope ... we won't see a lot in the way of price
appreciation,'' Kottman said.
   The various changes in December left the price index for
finished goods at 115.3 percent of its 1982 base. That meant a
hypothetical marketbasket of goods cost $115.30 in December, up
from $110 a year earlier.
   Earlier in the production process, prices fell 0.1 percent at
the intermediate level, rising 2.4 percent for the year.
   At the crude level, they rose 1.8 percent last month, the
steepest rise since March, and 6.9 percent for the year. The annual
gain was supported largely by a 35 percent rise in petroleum
prices, the sharpest in 10 years.
   An example of the three stages of production would be bread for
finished goods, flour for intermediate goods and wheat for crude
goods.

<HEAD>Campeau Split-Up Seen Reflecting Strategy For Saving Its Stores</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp.'s decision to give U.S. operations
more independence underscored a determination to prevent business
from unraveling at its department stores, attorneys and analysts
said Friday.
   Regardless whether Campeau places its retailers under bankruptcy
court protection, the health of the stores could be crucial.
   A fall-off in sales could further dim creditors' chances of
getting anything close to what they are owed and possibly threaten
the continued prominence of some prestigious names in retailing,
such as Bloomingdale's, a chain put on the auction block to raise
cash for its debt-encumbered parent. There were mixed reactions to
a Thursday announcement that Allied Stores Corp., Federated
Department Stores Inc., Ralphs Grocery Co. and the Canadian
company's other American holdings would be overseen by a new group
of trustees, composed mostly of independent U.S. residents.
   The Campeau board of directors also announced in Toronto that
they recommended the appointment of a new chief executive officer
for the U.S. operations.
   In addition, the board said Robert Campeau, the Canadian
entreprenuer who founded the company, will no longer have any
involvement in retailing, limiting his role to real estate
management and development.
   Until the trustees are designated, Campeau's U.S. businesses
will be run by the company's six independent directors. A
restructuring committee of four directors will be dissolved.
   Opinions differed on the implications of the moves.
   An attorney representing a group of Federated bondholders said
the transfer of control plus the prompt payment on Wednesday of
about $100 million in bills for Christmas merchandise indicated
that Campeau hasn't thrown in the towel yet by deciding to seek
bankruptcy court protection for its retailers.
   Robert M. Miller, a partner at the law firm Berlack, Israels &amp;
Liberman, said: ``The company is trying to obtain an out-of-court
settlement with its creditors.''
   He said as long as suppliers feel comfortable enough to ship
spring goods when the time comes in a few weeks and as long as
Citibank and other bank lenders don't declare Allied and Federated
in default on a $2.34 billion loan, negotiations can continue
between Campeau and creditors.
   Herman Gordon, senior vice president and general counsel of
Leslie Fay Cos. Inc., a large apparel maker, said the news this
past week from Campeau suggests the company is ``trying to keep the
stores intact and viable and that's good news for us.''
   Like other merchandise suppliers, Leslie Fay decided after being
paid for late 1989 shipments to fill spot orders placed by
Campeau's stores while continuing to monitor developments.
   A Citibank-led syndicate has given Campeau until Monday to prove
that Allied and Federated are solvent and making progress in
restructuring. If they cannot give the assurance they could be
declared in default and forced to file for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.
   It is widely speculated, however, that the banking syndicate
might be willing to wait longer, having extended the deadline once
already past the original Dec. 31 date.
   A Citibank spokeswoman declined to comment on the speculation.
   Geoffrey Lurie, a consultant with G.D.L. Management Inc. who has
specialized in corporate turnarounds, said he still believed that
the bankruptcy route was best.
   A Chapter 11 filing would allow the retailers to keep their
doors open while enabling them to get out of leases with
unfavorable terms and close poorly performing stores.
   Retailers have an easier time operating under Chapter 11
supervision than other types of businesses, he contended. Stores
can more readily convert assets into cash by slashing prices on
unwanted inventory.
   Janet Mangano, director of research at Josephthal &amp; Co. Inc.
said the odds of a bankruptcy filing have increased. Campeau may
have temporarily appeased suppliers but its bigger creditors aren't
satisfied.
   She said Campeau's attempt to repurchase 75 percent of the face
value of certain Federated and Allied bonds seems to be in
jeopardy. Campeau still doesn't appear able to cope with the
crushing debt burden acquired when it bought Federated in 1988 for
$6.6 billion and Allied in 1986 for $3.4 billion.
   Allied and Federated operate a combined total of 257 department
stores.
   The Allied stores are: Seattle-based Bon Marche, Boston-based
Jordan Marsh, Tampa, Fla.-based Maas Brothers and Stern's, Paramus,
N.J.
   Federated's stores include: New York-based Abraham &amp; Straus and
Bloomingdale's, Miami-based Burdines, Cincinnati-based Lazarus, and
Rich's-Goldsmith's in Atlanta.

   The biggest selloff since the October
``mini-crash'' hit the stock market Friday as new inflation worries
and market declines in Tokyo and London set a gloomy mood for Wall
Street.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 71.46 points to
2,689.21, for its largest loss since it plunged 190.58 last Oct. 13.
   Declining issues swamped advances by nearly 7 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 217 up,
1,483 down and 302 unchanged.
   The Dow Jones industrials lost 84.04 points for the week, wiping
out a 20.05-point advance in the first trading week of 1990.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of
finished goods rose 0.7 percent in December, exceeding advance
estimates for that measure of inflationary pressures.
   The index finished 1989 with an increase of 4.8 percent, its
biggest in eight years.
   Analysts said the news dealt an abrupt setback to hopes on Wall
Street for any further moves soon by the Federal Reserve to relax
its credit policy and encourage lower interest rates.
   Stock traders also were absorbing word of overnight declines in
the Japanese and British markets, where interest-rate and inflation
worries have also been unsettled investors lately.
   Tightening credit conditions overseas have raised fears that the
U.S. Treasury will have to pay higher interest rates to attract
buyers for its securities.
   International interest-rate competition, in turn, could pose
what some analysts describe as the threat of a business slump
through much or all of the industrialized world.
   Point-plus losers among the blue chips included General
Electric, down 1| at 63&lsqb;; International Business Machines, down 2
at 97~; Coca-Cola, down 2} at 73|; DuPont, down 2| at 123\, and
Philip Morris, down 1\ at 38}.
   Among leading overseas stocks traded in this country, British
Telecom dropped 1{ to 49&lsqb;; Matsushita Electric 1{ to 161{; British
Petroleum 1\ to 65&rsqb;, and Honda Motor \ to 24~.
   In the recently hot single-country fund group, Thai Fund lost 2|
to 31|; Helvetia Fund 1&rsqb; to 15\; Portugal Fund 2 to 18\; Austria
Fund } to 23\, and Mexico Fund 1&lsqb; to 12|.
   Philips Industries fell 2&rsqb; to 15|. Late Thursday a management
group that had been planning a $24-a-share buyout of the company
said it dropped the bid after failing to get financing for it.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 183.88 million
shares, against 154.39 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 220.10 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $77.14 billion, or 2.28
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 4.46 to 188.32.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 9.85 to 390.72, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 8.60 at 339.93.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slumped 9.14 to 439.72. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 372.23, down 7.12.

   Energy futures prices finished mostly lower
Friday after what analysts described as a volatile session.
   The February contract for West Texas Intermediate, the leading
grade of U.S. crude oil, lost 1 cent to settle at $23.13 per
42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The February
contract had risen 24 cents a barrel on Thursday. Other contract
months showed slight declines in Friday's trading.
   The February contract for No. 2 heating oil, which rose 2.44
cents on Thursday, rose 0.33 cent to settle at 69.65 cents a
gallon. But other contract months for heating oil posted declines.
   The February contract for unleaded gasoline traded on the Merc
fell 0.41 cent to settle at 65.09 cents a gallon, after rising 1.17
cents on Thursday.
   ``We ended basically nowhere after moving around all day,'' said
William Byers, who follows the oil futures market for the
investment firm Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. ``It was relatively volatile
during the day.''
   He said prices rallied at midday, but the rally fell apart and
prices skidded toward the end of the trading day.
   Byers attributed the heating oil increase to anticipation of
unusually cold weather in the Northeast.
   Gasoline prices had surged earlier this week in reaction to a
big decline in gasoline inventories, and some analysts said
Friday's pullback may have simply reflected profit-taking after the
runup.
   William Randol, who follows the oil futures market for First
Boston Corp., said the low inventory figure will likely continue to
drive gasoline prices higher.

<TEXT>
   Fotomat Corp., the Japanese-owned
film processor known for its tiny, parking-lot kiosks, has
announced plans to move its headquarters back to Hartford, Conn.
   The move is the latest in the decline of the company, whose
practice of processing film overnight at a central location was
made nearly obsolete by the arrival of one-hour processing labs.
   Fotomat at one time had nearly 3,800 yellow-and-red parking lot
kiosks and storefronts, but that has dwindled to 800 outlets. The
payroll at its St. Petersburg headquarters has plummeted to about
60 jobs from more than 200.
   When Fotomat moves to its new headquarters in Hartford this
spring, it will have only 18 workers as part of a decentralized
management structure.
   Fotomat moved to Florida from Connecticut in 1983. In 1986,
Konica Corp., the Japanese photography giant, increased its
minority ownership in Fotomat and took the company private.
   Konica's management held out hope for a comeback, but it could
not compete with drug store chains and rapid processing technology.
   Most of Fotomat's business now comes from wholesale work done at
seven regional photo labs.

<HEAD>U.S. Donates 75 Percent of Contraceptives to Third World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In over two decades the government has given
nearly 7 billion condoms to Third World countries, the Agency for
International Development reported.
   The agency said that about three-quarters of all the
contraceptives donated to developing countries come from the United
States.
   ``Since 1968 USAID has purchased $567.7 million worth of
contraceptives for distribution to 75 countries _ 6.9 billion
condoms, 1.6 billion cycles of oral contraceptives, 49.7
intrauterine devices (IUDs) and 16.5 million vaginal foaming
tablets,'' it reported.
   Duff Gillespie, the agency's director for population, said in an
interview that its orders for condoms have risen, from 535 million
in the year ended Sept. 30, 1988 to 735 million in the following
year. He added that the increase was due in part to the fight
against AIDS, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome, but also to
the expansion of the agency's population activities.
   Details of the population program appeared in the Fall 1989
edition of ``USAID Highlights,'' an agency publication distributed
to reporters this week.
   In the past, many Third World leaders were hostile to family
planning. They suspected a hidden policy of western countries to
keep down their influence by reducing their population. That has
been largely overcome, said Gillespie.
   ``These countries have had growth that's historically
unprecedented,'' he said in an interview.
   He pointed out that in Africa the population is expected to
double in 24 years at the present rate of increase, while in the
United States it will take 97 years.
   Third World leaders have been driven to act by their economic
situation, and the realization of how much more they will need to
spend on schools, housing and social services.
   ``In places like Kenya the government is enthusiastic for family
planning,'' said agency spokesman Jerry Lipscomb.
   Kenya, in east Africa, has one of the world's highest birth
rates. The Central Intelligence Agency estimated that its
population of more than 23 million people is growing by 4.4 percent
a year _ eight times as fast as the population of Japan, for
example.
   The agency cited one program in Kenya that serves an area of
350,000 people. It said 43 percent of the married women there now
practice birth control, compared with only 17 percent in the
country as a whole and women there average only 5.2 children
compared with 7.7.
   It said that in 1959 India was the only Third World country with
a population policy. Today there are such policies in 63
governments. Gillespie said that even governments with no official
policy are now receptive to outside efforts to hold down the number
of their citizens.
   The publication noted that the U.S. government does not support
abortion or what it called coercive family planning.
   Since 1981 the agency has spent $2.9 billion on population
activitiess. They cover a range from research on a hormone called
inhibin, which could be the basis for a contraceptive for men, to
financing popular songs about the dangers of pregnancy.
   ``In 1986, the first of the agency's six `hits' produced so far
were number one in Mexico and Peru and reached the top 10 in nine
other Latin American countries,'' the publication said.
   It claimed success for the agency's efforts, reporting that in
20 countries where it spent the most money, the average number of
children per family has dropped from 6.1 in the 1960s to 4.5 today.
   ``Whether or not they're absolutely responsible for bringing
down the birth rate in those 20 countries, they certainly can take
some credit,'' said Alex de Sherbinin of the Population Reference
Bureau.

   Federal regulators said Thursday they have
penalized the former chairman of Silverado Banking, Savings and
Loan Association of Denver and confirmed they met this week with
President Bush's son, who was a director of the thrift.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision barred Michael R. Wise, former
chairman and chief executive officer of the S&amp;L, from working for
any bank, S&amp;L or credit union without prior approval from
regulators.
   Meanwhile, thrift office spokesman William Fulwider said Neil
Bush, who served on Silverado's board from 1985 until August 1988,
met with the agency's enforcement officials on Monday.
   ``He's been here ... as have other associates of Silverado,''
Fulwider said, confirming a report in Thursday's editions of The
Houston Post.
   He declined to disclose the purpose of the meeting. But the
thrift office said it anticipates taking action against other
former directors and senior managers at Silverado.
   Wise is the third of the S&amp;L's officers to accept a penalty from
the thrift office. On Wednesday, Richard K. Vandapool, formerly
vice chairman and chief operating office of the thrift, and Robert
M. Lewis, formerly vice chairman and chief financial officer,
consented to similar orders.
   Wise, in agreeing to the order, denied any wrongdoing and said
he consented to avoid the expense of fighting the charge.
   Before regulators closed Silverado in December 1988, they cited
``grave conerns'' about Silverado's management, which steered the
thrift into risky commercial lending in the depressed Denver market
and permitted ``problem transactions'' with related parties such s
shareholders, officers and directors.
   Regulators sold Silverado to First Nationwide Financial Corp., a
subsidiary of Ford Motor Co. Its name was changed to Mile High
Federal Savings and Loan Association, which later merged with
Columbia Savings and now operates under that name.
   Another agency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., is
considering filing a civil suit against Silverado officers to
recover taxpayers' losses from the thrift's failure.

<HEAD>Tire Distributor Sues Goodyear for $153 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Florida tire distributor said Friday it has filed
a $153 million lawsuit against Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. for
allegedly fixing prices and supplies of imports.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Miami by Meldeau
International Inc., alleges Goodyear interfered with the Boca
Raton-based company's five-year agreement with Gummiwerke Fulda
GMBH, a West German subsidiary of Goodyear, to serve as exclusive
U.S. distributor of Fulda high-performance tires.
   ``As a direct and proximate result of Goodyear's actions,
Meldeau International's U.S. distribution business has been
destroyed,'' the suit said.
   Meldeau claims losses of more than $51 million because of
Goodyear. The antitrust suit also seeks interest costs and
attorneys' fees.
   The suit charges that Goodyear influenced Fluda to limit the
number of tires shipped to Meldeau and raise their prices.
   Akron, Ohio-based Goodyear said it has not seen the suit yet and
declined comment.

   Grain futures prices closed mixed and soybeans were lower Friday
on the Chicago Board of Trade as investors reacted to the release
of an Agriculture Department crop report.
   On other markets, orange juice was higher, precious metals were
mixed, copper fell, energy futures dropped, and livestock and meat
futures declined.
   Wheat settled 3\ cents lower to } cent higher with the contract
for delivery in March at $4.01{ a bushel; corn was 3} cents to 4\
cents higher with March at $2.42\ a bushel; oats were a { cent to }
cent lower with March at $1.43 a bushel; soybeans were a { cent to
4\ cents lower with January at $5.65{ a bushel.
   The USDA report, released Thursday, showed that the nation's
farmers planted less winter wheat and harvested less corn and fewer
soybeans last fall.
   Farmers planted about 57 million acres of winter wheat for
harvest this year, up 3 percent from the previous crop. The
department estimated the 1989 corn crop at 7.5 billion bushels and
soybean production at 1.9 billion bushels.
   Soybeans were sharply higher at the open, but fell back because
of weak cash prices and very good growing conditions in South
America.
   The smaller-than-expected corn harvest proved to be a boost to
corn futures.
   The reduced number of seedings sent wheat futures higher at the
open, but only the July new-crop contract ended on the plus side
due to somewhat dry conditions in pockets of winter wheat.
   Orange juice futures were sharply higher on New York's Cotton
Exchange as the USDA's first estimate on the orange juice crop
since the December freeze indicated losses were as severe as
anticipated.
   The Agriculture Department projected a 1989-90 orange harvest of
just 130 million 90-pound boxes. The estimate has been slashed 29
percent to 92 million boxes, the smallest estimated production
since the 1964-65 season.
   USDA analysts said losses to the current crop may go higher
because of heavy spoilage of early and midseason oranges still
being harvested for processing. There are indications that the
still-immature Valencia variety may have suffered extensive damage.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice was 5 cents to 12 cents higher
with January at $1.975 a pound.
   Gold closed lower on New York's Commodity Exchange, falling back
from when technical fund selling set in near the close.
   Gold had moved higher in response to the decline on the Tokyo
and London stock exchanges and a 71.46-point drop on the New York
Stock Exchange, said Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   But she said selling set in when the metal approached the $420
resistance level.
   Gold was 70 cents to 90 cents lower with February at $414.70 a
troy ounce. Silver was 2.3 cents to 3.3 cents higher with March at
$5.388 a troy ounce.
   Copper prices were off sharply on the Comex as concerns about
the economy and the slumping stock market triggered selling.
   Traders believe the decline of the stock market is an indication
there will be less industrial demand for copper, Ms. Raptopoulos
said. Adding to the pressure on the copper futures were forecasts
of increased stocks in London Metal Exchange-approved warehouses.
   Copper was 2.40 cents to 3.30 cents lower with February at
$1.063 a pound.
   Energy futures were lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 1 cent to 41 cents lower
with February at $23.13 a gallon; heating oil was .57 cent lower to
.33 cent higher with February at 69.65 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .50 cent lower to .01 cent higher with February at
65.09 cents a gallon.
   Livestock and pork futures were lower on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, as profit-taking hit the market.
   Live cattle were .20 cent to .32 cent lower with February at
77.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 80 cent lower to unchanged
with January at 83.85 cents a pound; hogs were .37 cent to .63 cent
lower with February at 50.67 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were 1.65 cents to 2 cents lower with February at 55.47 cents a
pound.

<HEAD>UAL Board Says Wolf Still Involved in Negotiations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp. Chairman Stephen M. Wolf remains
actively involved in talks with employee unions over a possible
buyout, the company's board said Friday, disputing reports Wolf had
been replaced in the discussions.
   The board ``has not precluded and, in fact, continues to
encourage Mr. Wolf to lead an ESOP proposal, and that process is
continuing,'' UAL spokesman Rob Doughty said, reading a prepared
statement.
   In trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, UAL tumbled
$4.75 a share to $159.50.
   The statement follows reports in Friday's Wall Street Journal
that the board asked Wolf to drop out of talks because of its
concern over the lack of progress Wolf has made in putting together
a new offer. It has been four months since an earlier employee
buyout bid fell apart.
   A securities analyst who follows the airline industry said
Friday the next major indicator for UAL's future should come after
its scheduled Jan. 25 board meeting, when a recapitalization plan
is to be completed.
   ``We've seen other deadlines come and go in this process,
though,'' said Robert Decker, an analyst for Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in
Chicago.
   The Journal reported that the board told its legal advisers,
Davis Polk &amp; Wardell of New York, and its financial advisers, First
Boston Corp., to take Wolf's place in negotiations.
   But in its statement Friday, the board said other parties have
always been involved in the talks.
   ``The fact that the board's representatives are also meeting
with union representatives is not new and is consistent with the
board's obligation to maximize shareholder value,'' the board said.
   The Journal said Wolf was believed to have had increasingly
strained relations with the head of the pilots' union, Frederick C.
Dubinsky, who had complained that the latest proposals to the union
asked employees to overpay for the company.
   Meanwhile, in a letter many of the company's 70,000 workers
received Thursday, Wolf said an employee buyout would improve labor
relations, strengthen the company and end the recurring threat of a
hostile takeover.
   He contended in the letter that Coniston Partners, the
investment firm that owns 11.8 percent of UAL, is trying to force a
recapitalization that could result in cutbacks in new aircraft
spending and a loss of United's market share.
   But Paul Tierney Jr. of Coniston countered, ``There is a lot of
politics in this situation. The letter is part of that.''
   He insisted Thursday that Coniston supports an employee buyout
and considers a recapitalization a second choice.
   At a meeting Thursday at the company's headquarters, Wolf told
about 100 management and nonunion employees that there was no new
buyout offer ready to submit to UAL's board, according to officials
who attended the session.
   Wolf suggested that any new bid would probably be at a lower
price than the $6.75 billion employee bid that failed in October
for lack of financing, said Sean McGrady, an official who attended
the meeting.
   UAL's directors asked their advisers on Monday to come up with a
recapitalization plan to present at the board's Jan. 25 meeting.

   Federal regulators on Thursday seized Atlantic
Financial Federal, Pennsylvania's largest savings institution,
transferring control to a new agency created to handle failing or
troubled thrifts.
   A new federal mutual association was created to acquire all
deposits and certain assets and liabilities of the Bala Cynwyd,
Pa., savings and loan, which was one of nine thrifts seized
Thursday to bring the total under government control to 293.
   Atlantic Financial will continue to maintain normal business
hours while the Resolution Trust Corp. negotiates a permanent
resolution. The RTC was created last August to dispose of about 600
failed thrifts.
   The RTC will be the conservator of the new federal mutual
assocation, which will be called Atlantic Financial Savings. The
association will inherit as assets three thrifts _ in California,
Nevada and West Virginia _ that had been held by Atlantic Financial
Federal.
   The seizure follows by three days the resignation of Atlantic
Financial President Donald R. Caldwell. His announcement came on
the day Atlantic was to submit a business plan showing federal
regulators why they should let the thrift remain independent
instead of being taken over by federal regulators.
   Atlantic Financial had about $5.8 billion in assets and $3.7
billion in 411,780 deposit accounts, according to the RTC. Deposits
continue to be federally insured.
   But the thrift was struggling to try to meet new financial
requirements instituted by the federal government in December. The
standards require savings and loans to make hefty increases in
capital, or net worth. Capital is the cushion available to cover
potential losses.
   Atlantic Financial's troubles stemmed partly from its
acquisition of failing thrifts.
   In the past months, the thrift sought to raise the cash
necessary to meet financial requirements, including offering to
sell six branch offices in Southern California. Those sales were
never consummated, according to William Eayre of the Pittsburgh
office of the Office of Thrift Supervision.
   The other thrifts seized on Thursday were: Investment Savings
and Loan Association of Chatsworth, Calif., $272.6 million in
assets; St. Charles Savings and Loan Association, St. Charles,
Ill., $158.1 million; Certified Savings Association, Georgetown,
Texas, $135.3 million; Deposit Trust Savings Bank, Monroe, La.,
$101.5 million; Wilshire Savings and Loan Association of Los
Angeles, $96.7 million; St. Louis County Federal Savings and Loan
Association of Ferguson, Ferguson, Mo., $87.8 million; American
Bank, Sanford, Maine, $55.1 million; and Financial Savings and Loan
Association of Fresno, Calif., $31.2 million.

   One Bancorp will try to recover from its
losses by selling virtually everything it owns except Maine Savings
Bank, which made the bad real estate loans that got the holding
company into trouble, officials said Thursday.
   The plan, reached in an agreement with federal and state
regulators, calls for One Bancorp to sell Bank of Hartford, Conn.,
with $435 million in assets; Southstate Bank for Savings, in
Massachusetts, with $345 million in assets; Winslow Investment Co.
and Winslow Asset Management, which operate five investment offices
in Maine; and nine branch offices of Maine Savings Bank in Maine.
   ``All of the major assets are going to be disposed of,''
President and Chief Executive Officer Vincent E. Furey Jr. said at
a news conference. ``The One Bancorp will essentially be the Maine
Savings Bank, and that will be a bank that will have somewehere
between $1 billion to $1.1 billion in assets.''
   As of Thursday, One Bancorp listed assets of $2.4 billion. It
declined to say how much it hoped to gain through the divestitures.
   One Bancorp reported losses of $74 million in the first nine
months of 1989. The company has postponed announcing its
fourth-quarter losses from late January until late February.
   Maine's banking superintendent, H. Donald DeMatteis, expressed
optimism for the recovery plan, which was part of an order from the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. that was approved by the Maine
Bureau of Banking.
   But DeMatteis acknowledged that the future of Maine Savings Bank
will be closely tied to the fortunes of the regional real estate
market, which has a bleak outlook.
   Federal and state regulators have set targets for the company to
improve its capital ratio. It will have to pump $20 million into
Maine Savings Bank, and proceeds from the bank sales will go to
Maine Savings Bank as well.
   The company is also prohibited from declaring or paying
dividends or taking on any new debt without approval from the
Federal Reserve.

<HEAD>Big Decline in Tokyo Sends Markets Tumbling in London, New York</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM BUERKLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The biggest decline in more than two years on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange sent a chill through London and Wall Street Friday as
investors reacted to growing concern about inflation and higher
interest rates.
   The chain reaction also demonstrated that tremors in Tokyo's
financial markets can have big repercussions overseas _ especially
in the United States _ because Japan is the world's largest
creditor.
   ``Maybe this is the first example that our dependence of capital
is making us catch cold when someone sneezes,'' said Robert Brusca,
chief financial economist at Nikko Securities Co. International
Inc. in New York.
   A big drop in Japanese government bond prices and weakness in
the yen sent share prices tumbling in Tokyo early Friday. The
Nikkei average of 225 stocks plummeted 653.36 points, the biggest
one-day point decline since a loss of 731.91 points on Nov. 10,
1987.
   In the first seven sessions of the new year, the index has lost
almost 1,400 points, or 3.7 percent.
   Later, stocks fell sharply in London with the FT-SE 100 share
index falling 37.8 points to 2,380.1, the biggest drop in seven
weeks.
   The selloff continued in New York, where the Dow Jones
industrial average plunged 71.46 points, or 2.59 percent, to
2,689.21. It was the biggest point drop since last October's
mini-crash, which knocked 190.58 points off the average, and the
13th biggest ever.
   The weakness of the yen and expectations that Japan's interest
rates will have to go still higher to make the currency more
attractive have hurt bonds and stocks, Tokyo analysts said. Bank of
Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno helped accelerate the fall Friday by
saying the yen's weakness could boost inflation by raising the
prices of imported fuel and raw materials.
   ``The market started falling as players realized that a higher
yen and lower interest rates, the keys to last year's booming
market, won't come true,'' said Hironobu Hagio, a securities
analyst with Nippon Life Insurance Co. in Tokyo.
   There was more bad inflation news in the United States Friday
with the report that the producer price index rose 0.7 percent in
December. That brought inflation at the wholesale level to 4.8
percent in 1989, the highest since 1980.
   David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities
International Inc. in New York, said any rise in inflation should
be short-lived, stemming mainly from cold-induced runups in the
price of oil and produce.
   A more serious problem for the U.S. stock and bond markets is
that they are less attractive today to international investors,
Resler said.
   Interest rates have risen recently in Europe as well as Japan
because of a perception that inflation is increasing. Higher rates
abroad could force a similar move in the United States because of
the need to attract foreign capital to finance the country's large
deficits.
   Nikko's Brusca said yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds now
are only about 1.85 percentage points higher than yields on 10-year
Japanese government bonds. That's one of the smallest differentials
of the past decade and down from a margin of more than 4 percentage
points early in 1989, he said.
   ``The fear is that the U.S. is not an attractive place for
foreigners to invest now,'' Brusca said.
   Domestic investors haven't shown a willingness to take up the
slack, Resler said. ``The key is that there seems to be relatively
little activity coming from the institutional investors in the U.S.
at a time when institutional investors overseas are inclined to
liquidate to their dollar holdings,'' he said.
   There were a few bright spots Friday.
   West Germany withstood the selloff with stocks finishing mixed
in Frankfurt. Hopes that the democratization of Eastern Europe will
pay off with a big growth dividend for West Germany have supported
the Frankfurt market and the German mark.
   In New York, the American Stock Exchange won regulatory approval
to begin trading a type of put option on Japan's Nikkei stock
average. The puts allow investors to profit from a decline in the
index, and Friday's plunge in Tokyo sparked heavy interest.
   The options rose to $5 apiece from $4.125 at the opening. Volume
totaled more than 3.1 million options, ``far above expectations,''
said Benjamin D. Krause, senior vice president of the securities
division at the Amex.

   The biggest sell-off since the October

market declines in Tokyo and London set a gloomy mood for Wall
Street.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 71.46 points
Friday to 2,689.21, for its largest loss since it plunged 190.58
last Oct. 13.
   Declining issues swamped advances by nearly 7 to 1 in nationwide

   Soaring energy costs pushed wholesale prices
up 0.7 percent in December, bringing inflation in 1989 to an
eight-year high of 4.8 percent, the government said.
   The sharp, seasonally adjusted monthly rise helped spook
financial markets, which read it as a sign the Federal Reserve
would not lower interest rates anytime soon.
   Markets also were reacting Friday to stock plunges earlier in
London and Tokyo.

   Retail sales increased just 5 percent in 1989,

   The program has no target or deadline, spokesman Terry Sullivan
said Friday. It is separate from GM's ``Action Plan'' of 1987 that
aims to slash up to $13 billion in costs by the end of this year.
   The new cost-cutting is another sign of concern about industry
conditions. Car and truck sales have been slumping since October,
when the 1990 model year began.

   Bond prices fell sharply Friday, reflecting
investor discouragement over a government report showing inflation
at its worst level in eight years during 1989.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond fell 21-32 point, or
$6.56 for every $1,000 in face value. The bond's yield, which rises
when its price declines, surged to 8.17 percent from 8.11 percent
late Thursday.
   The government's report that producer prices rose 0.7 percent in
December took a toll on the credit markets.
   Raymond Stone, a bond market analyst with Stone &amp; McCarthy
Research Associates Inc., said traders were particularly
discouraged by the fact that prices exclusive of the volatile food
and energy segments rose a sharp 0.6 percent.
   ``It would reduce any inclination of the (Federal Reserve)
toward easing'' credit, Stone said.
   The Fed generally tightens credit _ moving interest rates higher
in the process _ to try to control inflation. If interest rates
move up, bond prices fall. Higher inflation also is a negative sign
for bond traders because it erodes the value of fixed-income
securities.
   The government also issued a report showing retail sales rose a
sluggish 0.2 percent last month, indicating a slowing of the
economy. But the news, which ordinarily might be bullish for the
bond market, was not enough to offset the downbeat inflation report.
   Paul W. Boltz, an economist with T. Rowe Price Associates, a
financial services firm in Baltimore, said inflation is generally
expected to slow if other indicators show the economy is sluggish.
   The wholesale price report helped send the stock market sharply
lower, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 71.46 to
2,689.21, but the bond market generally did not benefit, as it
sometimes does, from losses on Wall Street.
   When stocks are down, bonds are sometimes seen as a safer haven,
and many investors pick up Treasury issues in what is called a
``flight to quality.''
   Prices fell in the junk bond market in response to the decline
on Wall Street.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, short-term
government issues were unchanged, intermediate maturities fell 1-32
point to 5-16 point and long-term issues dropped | point, according
to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial information
service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 2.57 to 1,179.39.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills declined to 7.72 percent as
the discount slipped 7 basis points to 7.48 percent. Yields on
six-month bills rose to 7.82 percent as the discount rose 3 basis
points to 7.43 percent. Yields on newly issued one-year bills were
unchanged from their level at auction Thursday at 7.74 percent as
the discount rose 1 basis point to 7.22 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 8 1-16 percent, unchanged from late Thursday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 3-16 point to 92 31-32. The average
yield to maturity rose to 7.29 percent from 7.27 percent late
Thursday.
