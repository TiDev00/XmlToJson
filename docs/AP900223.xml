   The opposition coalition will
recognize an election victory by President Daniel Ortega's
Sandinista party if the vote is fair and the count is honest, vice
presidential candidate Virgilio Godoy said Friday.
   ``We will forget all the unfair campaign practices of the FLSN
(Sandinistas) if the final voting process Sunday is clean,'' Godoy
told a news conference.
   ``If there is fraud _ and we are not saying now that there will
be _ we will issue a public protest and then consider other forms
of passive resistance,'' Godoy said.
   Elliott Richardson, the head of the U.N. observer mission, told
a news conference he expects a fair election.
   ``I've given a lot of thought to how the system could be beat,''
he said. ``I haven't yet been able to come up with a good scheme.''
Richardson is a former U.S. attorney general.
   The final U.N. pre-election report he released concludes that
the election has done much to move Nicaragua toward becoming a
pluralistic society.
   Meanwhile, former President Jimmy Carter, perhaps the most
important of the estimated 2,000 observers of Sunday's vote,
arrived in Managua. He was meeting the main presidential candidates
as well as other leading observers during the afternoon.
   Carter drove through streets filled with Sandinista banners,
posters and placards, past people wearing ``Daniel Presidente''
caps, backpacks, and T-shirts. Eight feet in the air, black-and-red
Sandinista helium balloons decorated the fronts of many businesses.
   In contrast, a lone red-and-white UNO (United National
Opposition) banner hung across one boulevard. The minor Social
Christian Party's blue fish symbol was more evident, drawn by hand
on walls.
   Ortega, his voice hoarse and gravelly after days of publicly
speaking, maintained his conciliatory attitude towards the
opposition he expects to beat soundly on Sunday.
   ``The Sandinista National Liberation Front is in agreement with
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's call to avoid violence,'' said Ortega
after meeting with Joao Baena Soares, secretary-general of the
Organization of American States and another top observer.
   Ortega and Mrs. Chamorro of the opposition coalition are the
leading presidential candidates. Eight others are running but are
given little chance.
   Also at stake are the vice presidency, a 90-member National
Assembly and 146 city, town and regional councils. About 1.75
million people are registered to vote.
   Godoy dismissed a recent poll by the Washington Post that
indicated a big Sandinista lead as ``lacking credibility.''
   ``Nicaraguans are afraid. When the Nicaraguan is polled, he is
always trying to figure who is conducting the poll and his
motives,'' he said.
   Ortega said he was certain of victory and trusted Mrs.
Chamorro's desire to avoid violence, but that he was still worried
about more radical elements of the opposition.
   Military sources said Friday that a large contingent of Contra
rebels, perhaps as many as 300, has descended from mountain camps
in the central province of Chontales.
   Adolfo Vargas, a member of the Villa Sandino city council, said
groups of 20 rebel fighters had been spotted in the bush and fields
near the main road to the Atlantic coast.
   He said the government fears they may try to provoke violence or
intimidate voters on election day, although the Contra leadership
has said the guerrillas have been told only to defend themselves
and not to interfere in the election process.
   On Thursday, Ortega said the Sandinistas have spent about $7
million on their campaign.
   He said any complaints about the illegal use of government
property should be filed with the Supreme Electoral Council or the
international observers.
   Godoy said the opposition coalition spent less than $1 million
``because the money promised by the United States never arrived.''
   However, other political sources said the coalition did receive
money from the United States through private donations and other
channels.
   U.S. officials have said that if Ortega wins a free and fair
election, the Bush administration would consider normalizing
relations with Managua, as long as other conditions are fulfilled
as well. Those include stopping the export of arms to leftist
guerrillas in El Salvador and honoring human rights.
   Ortega, in an interview published in Saturday editions of The
New York Times, was quoted as saying that if re-elected he would
not provide arms to the Salvadoran guerrillas. In the past, Ortega
has said he would respect regional agreements prohibiting giving
arms to the guerrillas.

<HEAD>Shell Spill: 672,000 Gallons, 16 Times Greater Than Suspected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROXANA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pipeline break at a Shell oil refinery
near the Mississippi river spilled an estimated 672,000 gallons of
crude oil, 16 times more than the company originally said, the
state announced Thursday.
   Monday's accident was the latest in a series of mishaps at the
refinery in the last two years.
   ``In pipeline leaks alone, there has been more than a million
gallons of product loss since mid-December,'' said Will Flower, a
spokesman for the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. ``There
was a 300,000-gallon gasoline spill.''
   The new estimate of Monday's spill was released by the state
EPA, which is calling for a multimillion dollar study of a series
of leaks, spills and fires at the refinery near St. Louis, Mo.
   ``Shell called us this morning with the updated figure,'' Flower
said.
   He said no oil reached the river or a nearby marsh after the
rupture in the pipeline, which leads from a storage tank at the
refinery.
   ``The cleanup could take weeks, if not months,'' Flower said.
   Calls to the Shell refinery went unanswered late Thursday
afternoon.
   Clean-up crews on Thursday used absorbent booms to soak up oil
that washed into a retention pond built to catch spills, Flower
said.
   The pond discharges into a marshy area, but there wasn't any
noticeable oil in the marshy area, he said.
   On Wednesday, the Illinois EPA called for a study of the
refinery to discover the cause of its recurring accidents.
   ``At this time, the entire Shell facility is a prime candidate
for a hazard and operability study,'' Flower said. ``They do seem
to be getting worse, and we feel a real strong need to get a study
under way.''
   Illinois Attorney General Neil F. Hartigan filed a lawsuit in
September against Shell, seeking $1.2 million in penalties for the
various environmental mishaps. Last week, Hartigan amended the suit
to include nine other accidents at the refinery since late November.

<HEAD>Women, Men's Survival After Heart Attacks Equivalent, Researchers
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contrary to previous findings, women survive as
well as men after heart attacks if their age and other illnesses
are taken into account, a new study says.
   ``Merely being a woman in and of itself does not appear to be a
risk factor'' in connection with heart attacks, said lead
researcher Dr. Nicholas H. Fiebach of Yale University School of
Medicine.
   Fiebach and his colleagues explored the issue after two previous
studies yielded conflicting results.
   The new study involved 332 women and 790 men who had suffered
heart attacks, and found that 29 percent of the women and 23
percent of the men died within the three years after the attack.
   But ``when we did a statistical analysis that took into account
differences in age, diabetes and hypertension, the differences in
mortality weren't there anymore,'' Fiebach said in a telephone
interview Thursday.
   Heart disease is the leading killer of men and women, but women
tend to be stricken when they are older and have more health
problems, said Fiebach, whose study appears in Friday's Journal of
the American Medical Association.
   Women were more critically ill when they were admitted to the
hospital, and a greater proportion of them died there than did men,
the researchers found.
   After being discharged from the hospital, however, the women's
adjusted death rate appeared to be a little better than men's,
though the difference was not statistically significant, Fiebach
said.
   That finding is consistent with the fact that women in general
tend to outlive men, he said.
   Critics of government-funded research have said recently that it
has focused too heavily on middle-aged white men, leaving a gap in
knowledge about women's health risks.
   ``It looks, from all of the studies we have to date, like the
main risk factors for coronary heart disease in men are probably
similar to the risk factors in women,'' Fiebach said.
   He said researchers need to study whether risk factors _ traits
that correspond with above-average risk _ exist in women when they
don't in men.
   ``We know there is some relationship between female hormones and
coronary heart disease and menopause,'' he said.

<HEAD>Trial Judge Upholds Release On Bond Of Noriega Co-Defendant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILL LESTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trial judge in the drug trafficking case
against ousted Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega upheld the
release on bond of co-defendant Daniel Miranda on Thursday, but
changed his bail conditions.
   Miranda and defendant Eduardo Pardo, who has pleaded guilty to a
charge of illegal travel, were accused of flying $800,000 in drug
money from Fort Lauderdale to Panama in 1983. A week ago, Pardo
became the first of Noriega's co-defendants to plead guilty.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler upheld the pretrial release
order of federal Magistrate Peter Palermo, but changed the amount
of corporate surety bond from $100,000 to $200,000, while lowering
the level of personal surety bond from $900,000 to $800,000, said
Miranda's attorney, Michael O'Kane.
   O'Kane said the change in the corporate surety bond has doubled
the 15 percent Miranda's family will have to pay to get him out.
The personal surety bond will be backed by mortgages, he said.
   ``If the family can come up with $30,000 then he can get out. I
thought that (Hoeveler) would uphold Palermo's decision,'' O'Kane
said. ``But it increases the money he has to come up with, and that
will make it a little harder.''
   Miranda, who has been held at the federal Metropolitan
Correctional Center south of Miami, would be the second Noriega
co-defendant released on bond. Brian Alden Davidow, who surrendered
in February 1988, was released on bond four days after the
indictment was handed down.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from the
cartel. The Panamanian leader, who surrendered to U.S. troops after
the December invasion of his country, has disputed the right of a
U.S. civilian court to judge him.
   That question and other pending motions will be considered when
Noriega and four co-defendants are to appear before Hoeveler Monday.
   Pardo faces up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine and
will face sentencing April 25 on the single count of illegal travel.
   Prosecutors say Pardo and Miranda flew a Lear jet fitted with
secret compartments so that money could be hidden.
   But O'Kane said when Pardo pleaded that Miranda didn't know the
money came from drugs.
   ``I guess Pardo's guilty. That doesn't mean that Miranda is,''
O'Kane said at the time.

<TEXT>
   A pickup truck loaded with drums of suspected
explosive material erupted in flames near an Internal Revenue
Service office Thursday, snarling traffic and forcing the
evacuation of thousands.
   The abandoned truck burned itself out shortly after the fire was
reported at 5 a.m., but police closed off a 15-block area for at
least 13{ hours as a police bomb squad worked to defuse what
appeared to be a makeshift bomb.
   ``The potential danger was very great,'' Assistant Police Chief
Robert Vernon said Thursday afternoon.
   Vernon said material in the five drums appeared to be extremely
dangerous, but it was not immediately identified. As he spoke, a
fork lift operator was lifting the barrels out of the back of the
truck.
   ``We can't say at this moment that it would have flattened so
many blocks, but we have to assume the worst,'' Vernon said. The
assistant chief added he could not remember an explosive situation
``quite this large. It looked to experts that it had the potential
of being a large explosive device.''
   The truck was parked outside a City National Bank building that
also houses an IRS annex and other offices.
   Several explosions accompanied the early morning fire, said
Cmdr. William Booth.
   ``It was shooting out flames,'' said Jim Nord, a 21-year-old tow
truck driver who said he saw the truck burning early Thursday.
``There were explosions that sounded like shotgun blasts.''
   Officers allowed the fire to burn itself out, called in bomb
squad and hazardous materials experts and cordoned off the area.
Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms also were
called in.
   Booth said the substance in drums ``can be easily ignited and
can explode.'' He said the material ``is something our people know
how to handle.''
   The street closure created nightmares for rush hour commuters in
the heavily commercial district.
   A fifth-floor window in the IRS office was broken, said Officer
Sylvia Palacio of the West Los Angeles station. But it was unknown
whether the broken window was related to the truck fire.
   IRS spokesman Robert Giannangeli said the agency had received no
bomb threats. He said up to 250 agency personnel, including
auditors, return examiners and criminal investigators, were based
at the office.
   While the investigation took place, several thousand workers and
residents were asked to evacuate the area. The Red Cross set up a
shelter for evacuees at the Westwood Park &amp; Recreation Center, said
Red Cross spokeswoman Barbara Wilks.

<DATELINE>BUGINA VILLAGE, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From across a gurgling brook,
Abrahim Baht can see the house of his brother inside India but
cannot go over to visit.
   When someone marries, Baht can hear the celebration from the
house, which is about 10 yards away. When there's a death, the
mournful wailing also reaches his ears.
   Baht, 80, is banned from the house of his brother, Suleiman, by
a cease-fire line that separates India from Pakistan.
   Indian troops man bunkers opposite Baht's corn fields where the
snow-capped mountains of the Himalayas stretch into the heavens.
Pakistani trenches line the hills behind him. Sometimes a rattle of
automatic weapons fire cuts through the peace of Bugina.
   Baht and his 70-year-old brother are Kashmiris, the people who
have inhabited this Himalayan village for centuries.
   Their land was split between India and Pakistan in 1947
following the end of British colonial rule. The two countries
fought wars over the region in 1948 and 1965. Now, although few
fear another conflict, tensions are heating up again on the line.
   On Jan. 20, Indian troops launched a crackdown on Moslem
separatists in India's state of Jammu-Kashmir, the only state in
predominantly Hindu India with a Moslem majority. The separatists
want either an independent Kashmir or union with Pakistan, a Moslem
nation.
   Tensions escalated when Indian troops killed several Pakistani
students Feb. 11 on the border after the students tried to cross
into India in solidarity with the separatists.
   The recent troubles have made it even harder for Baht and his
brother.
   When times were good, the men would meet on a small rock in the
middle of the stream and gossip about life on either side.
Sometimes they would bring dishes for each other, made by their
wives. There are no telephones.
   Now, Pakistan and Indian troops have forbidden them from even
talking.
   ``Don't let me catch you sneaking to the brook, old man!''
Pakistan army Lt. Raza Aqeel shouted at Baht one recent day near
the cease-fire line. ``You've lived a long time. Don't end it with
an Indian bullet.''
   ``They are my people, how can I ignore them?'' Baht growled as
his beard, dyed red with henna, bobbed up and down. ``Politics has
divided my house in two. My heart is weeping.''
   Aqeel commands the posts above Baht's house and is responsible
for security in Bugina, a village of about 500 people.
   ``We are ready for the enemy,'' Aqeel said, full of a soldier's
bravado. ``We have all the newest weapons and we are sure to win.''
   The young lieutenant's bluster is not shared by Mohammed Arfan,
a 45-year-old farmer who lives in a big blue house just yards from
the Baht clan.
   Arfan fled to Pakistan after the 1965 war, which like the 1948
conflict, was lost by Islamabad. He joined the Pakistan army,
traveled throughout the country but chose to settle in Bugina
because it was the nearest he could get to his native home.
   ``This is my valley and fighting would only make us poorer,''
said the 45-year-old father of six. ``I wish the politicians would
forget us and then maybe we could live in peace.''
   Arfan grew up on the Indian side of the cease-fire line. To this
day, his father and three brothers live in a small compound across
the creek in India.
   ``I came back in 1970. I was homesick for the Kashmir but living
here mixes happiness with pain,'' he said. ``I am so close to my

   Two weeks ago, one of his nephews was married on the Indian side.
   ``Listening to the noise was like a dagger splitting you in

   Bugina is populated by devout Moslems. Men often conduct their
noon prayers on rocks amid the roaring blue waters of the Neelum
River, which means turquoise in the Urdu language. Women cover
their heads in public and are generally banned from the bazaar in
the nearest town, about a mile away.
   Thus, it is to their god, Allah, that many in Bugina look to
solve the problems of Kashmir.
   India is not expected to give up its portion and Pakistan would
not tolerate an independence movement on its side of the cease-fire
line.
   Says Baht, pointing to his brother who has come out of his house
on the other side of the line: ``All we can do is pray.''

   Nicaraguan voters will mark three
separate ballots in Sunday's election, then dip a thumb in nearly
indelible blue ink to ensure they won't vote again.
   More than 1.7 million people have registered to vote in the
elections for president, National Assembly and municipal councils.
The voting age is 16.
   Voting in the nation's 4,394 polling precincts begins at 7 a.m.
and ends at 6 p.m. Anyone in line to vote at closing time will be
allowed to mark the paper ballots that bear party or coalition
symbols as well as the names of the candidates and their
affiliation.
   Election officials will check voter registration cards against a
master list of voters before permitting people to vote.
   The registration cards do not bear a photo of the voter but they
indicate each citizen's name, address, age and a registration
number. They also indicate where the bearer is allowed to vote and
where his or her name should be on the master registration list
prepared by the Supreme Electoral Council, the national election
authority.
   The ballots are cast in a booth to assure privacy, then put into
boxes, one for each race. Then each voter is required to dip a
thumb in bright blue ink, donated by Venezuela. Election observers
who have sampled the ink say it takes days to wash off.
   Once the polls close, the ballot boxes will be opened and
counted in each precinct in the presence of poll watchers from each
party, election officials and any accredited international
observers who are present.
   The results and other information, such as who witnessed the
count, will be compiled on official tally sheets and the results
will be telegraphed to central office of the Supreme Electoral
Council in the capital as well as the regional council.
   Officials say they will begin releasing preliminary results on
election night.
   The president of each precinct will deliver the ballots,
registration lists, tally sheets and other materials to one of the
nine regional election centers for a second count.
   Observers from both the United Nations and the Organization of
America States will be present in each of the nine regional centers
as well as many local precincts and they will also be given copies
of the official tally sheets.
   There are more than 1,000 official observers accredited by the
Supreme Electoral Council. Both the United Nations and the OAS will
do parallel tallies to check against the official results.
   Many of the voting procedures were designed with input from the
observer teams and the political parties, each of which is
represented on the Supreme Electoral Council.

   The nose gear of a Canadian Air Force
jet carrying some members of the Canadian Parliament collapsed when
the plane landed at the Charleston International Airport late
Thursday, authorities said.
   There were no injuries among the 62 people aboard the Boeing 707
in the 4:37 p.m. accident, said John Whiteside, a spokesman for the
Federal Aviation Administration in Atlanta.
   ``It slid to a stop on the runway after the landing gear
collapsed,'' said Whiteside. ``There was slight damage to the nose
of the aircraft.''
   Capt. Alain Francois, the public information officer for the
Canadian Forces in Ottawa, said a number of members of the Canadian
Parliament were among the 53 passengers on the craft. He did not
say how many.
   He said the plane had left Ottawa earlier in the day but did not
know the purpose of the trip to Charleston.
   Capt. Paul Tessyman, a spokesman for the Canadian Air Force Base
in Trenton, said the families of the parliamentarians had been
notified that they are safe and the legislators will be returning
to Canada on Monday.
   The Air Force Base and the Charleston International Airport
share the same runways.
   Officials said the accident would be investigated by both
American and Canadian aviation officials.

<HEAD>FBI Begins Inquiry Into Stuart Shootings Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI has begun a preliminary inquiry into the
way Boston police investigated the circumstances surrounding the
shooting of Carol Stuart, who was apparently the victim of a fatal
plot concocted by her husband.
   Initiated at the request of U.S. Attorney Wayne Budd, the probe
was undertaken ``concerning allegations that individuals were
coerced or intimidated into making statements implicating Willie
Bennett,'' according to a statement issued Thursday by FBI special
agent Thomas Hughes.
   Bennett was named as a suspect after the pregnant attorney was
shot Oct. 23 and her husband, Charles Stuart, was seriously
wounded. His name was cleared after Stuart apparently committed
suicide Jan. 4 upon learning that his brother had implicated him in
the crime.
   Stuart originally told police a black gunman had murdered his
wife in the city's Mission Hill neighborhood, touching off a
massive search in which black residents allege their civil rights
were violated and witnesses were coerced.
   Police Commissioner Francis M. Roache was advised of the inquiry
and has promised the department's cooperation, the statement said.
   Roache and Suffolk County District Attorney Newman Flanagan did
not immediately return messages late Thursday night.
   Mayor Raymond Flynn, in an interview with television station
WGBH, said he welcomed the probe and vowed to take disciplinary
action if any police officers were charged with wrongdoing.

   Pop star Stevie Wonder says justice is sweet
following a jury's rejection of a $25 million claim that his
Oscar-winner song ``I Just Called to Say I Love You'' was stolen
from another songwriter.
   The plaintiff, Lloyd Chiate, claimed Wonder's song, part of the
movie soundtrack for ``Woman in Red,'' was taken from a song he
co-wrote titled, ``I Just Called To Say.''
   ``I knew the truth in my heart all along,'' said Wonder. ``I'm
very sorry a lot of people had to spend a lot of precious time in
this courtroom. But I do appreciate and respect justice.''
   Wonder, 39, offered to try to smooth over the dispute by writing
a song with Chiate and Lee Garrett, co-author of ``I Just Called To
Say,'' and donate the proceeds to charity.
   ``Then we all really win,'' Wonder said.
   Chiate wasn't present when the jury announced its verdict
Thursday. His attorney, Herbert Dodell, said his client was wronged
by a star-struck jury and a biased judge.

   Doug Mays, 40, of Moss Point, Miss., wanted the bodyguards
arrested after the scuffle Wednesday, but police officer Richard
Baily said he couldn't file charges because the parties involved
gave conflicting statements.
   Mays and his wife, Sammie, 32, said they were headed for the
15th floor of the hotel to meet ``Good Morning America'' host
Charlie Gibson who was doing his television program from Pensacola.
   Mays said they tried to get off the elevator on the 14th floor,
reserved for members of the Jackson tour, in search of a soft drink
machine. The photographer said he didn't know Jackson was in town.
   The bodyguards ``shoved me back in the elevator,'' said Mays,
whom police said was not hurt.
   The bodyguards, Jack Colen, 56, of Palos Verdes Estates, Calif.,
and Marcus David Johnson, 30, of Huntington Beach, Calif., told
police they pushed Mays after he used racial slurs when they told
him to leave.

   King is seeking several million dollars in damages and also is

prevent Douglas from fighting without his involvement.
   Douglas won the title with a shocking 10th-round knockout of
Mike Tyson on Feb. 11 in Tokyo. Douglas has said he will not fight
for King because the promoter challenged the result of the bout by
claiming that Douglas got a long count after being knocked down in

   Israeli warplanes on Friday blasted a guerrilla
base in southern Lebanon in Israel's fourth air raid in less than a
week in the same area, the military command said.
   It was the second attack within 24 hours at the base near the

targets were hit and the planes returned safely to base, the
command said.
   The statement said the base was used by a terrorist organization

   The same base was hit Thursday, and Beirut radio stations
reported at the time Israeli warplanes struck a base belonging to a
Lebanese fundamentalist Moslem militia known as the Islamic
Grouping. Three guerrillas were reported injured in Thursday's raid.
   On Saturday, Israeli aircraft attacked a position near Sidon
used by the mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal militia.
   On Monday, Israeli jets bombed a base near Sidon belonging to
the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist PLO

   The drive to unify Germany, which has the
enthusiastic support of the Bush administration, may have to slow
down to deal with some painful questions about borders and with
echoes of a horrible past.
   The pace has picked up to the point Secretary of State James A.
Baker III would not be surprised if there is union of West Germany
with East Germany by the end of the year. Many West Germans say
they are sure of it.
   As Baker and his key advisers see it, free elections in East
Germany in mid-March will legitimize the government that emerges.
The elected leaders then could begin unification talks quickly with
West Germany.
   The catchy ``Two-Plus-Four'' formula that Baker persuaded the
Soviet Union, Britain and France to approve at an Open Skies
conference last week in Ottawa gives the Germans a lot of room to
decide their country's future.
   The Big Four allies of World War II then would meet to discuss
security issues. But the formula is vague on how much influence the
four _ the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France _
would have over sovereign German policy.
   So far, the main U.S. goal is that Germany remain in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization. However, there is a lot more on the
minds of the Soviet Union and Poland, bloodied victims of German
invasion a half-century ago.
   They are seeking reassurance the mighty country about to emerge
is not looking eastward to recover territory lost at the end of
World War II.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev acknowledged again on
Tuesday that the two Germanys had a right to unify. But he stressed
the Soviet Union's own ``inalienable right'' to make sure
unification does not lead to ``moral, political or economic
damage.''
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, meanwhile, suggested
unification would not happen ``as quickly as they imagine in
Bonn,'' adding that ``it requires several years.''
   The German lebensraum that drove the world into its costliest
war in 1939 is on the minds of lots of Europeans.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher has said
repeatedly the new Germany would encompass West Germany, East
Germany and the now-divided city of Berlin, but it would seek no
other territory.
   The two Germanys have signed agreements recognizing Poland's
western border. But West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who will
visit President Bush this weekend at Camp David, has said he cannot
make promises about the border on behalf of a united Germany.
   Other victims of Nazi aggression also are anxious.
   Moshe Arad, the Israeli ambassador to Washington, told the
American Jewish Congress in West Palm Beach, Fla., Monday that
Israel recognizes the right of the German people to determine their
own destiny.
   At the same time, Arad said, ``we are totally justified in
observing with trepidation the movement toward German unification.''
   The Nazis and their accomplices tried to extinguish European
Jewry in World War II. They nearly reached their goal, killing 6
million.
   Poland, which was crushed by the German war machine, is seeking
a peace treaty to secure its western border.
   ``We are demanding that before the reunification,'' Prime
Minister Tadeausz Mazowiecki said Wednesday. ``The total removal of
those ambiguities must take place.''
   So far, the Bush administration will not expand the group of
four to include Poland or other European countries. The U.S.
position rests on the agreement at the end of World War II that
gave the Big Four allies special rights over vanquished Germany.
   But Mazowiecki said ``it is unthinkable in today's democratic
world to have this form of Yalta, where one group of countries
could decide about another.''
   West Germany has rejected a role for Poland, but approval of the
``Two-Plus-Four'' plan in Ottawa does not deter the Soviet Union
from supporting Warsaw's claim.
   The uncertain situation has had an ironic twist. The
Solidarity-dominated Warsaw government wants to keep Soviet troops
in Poland as insurance against the new Germany even as it breaks
away from Leninism.
   Genscher, with U.S. support, has offered to keep NATO forces
from moving into what is now East German territory after
unification. But evidently the offer is not enough to quiet
everyone's nerves.
   Kohl's talks with Bush and Baker will have to take these
concerns into account.

<HEAD>Landfill Fight Latest in War Between Cape Community and Uncle Sam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stop dumping your trash on our national
seashore, the federal government is telling the Cape Cod, Mass.,
community of Provincetown.
   Stop playing Big Brother with our land, is the town's response.
   What began as a squabble over the future of the Provincetown
landfill has escalated to a Cabinet and congressional-level fight.
   On the surface is a dispute over the future of a town dump
located on federal property. Underneath, according to some
participants, is the latest skirmish in a dispute between a small
community and the federal government over one of the nation's most
popular seacoast attractions _ the Cape Cod National Seashore.
   ``The seashore has an `I don't care' attitude,'' Sandra Turner,
Provincetown's public works director, said Thursday. ``This is Big
Brother _ the federal government _ and it's picking on this tiny
community.''
   The federal government no longer wants Provincetown to use
National Seashore land for its town landfill. Seashore officials
have given the community of 3,200 year-round residents on the tip
of Cape Cod until October to find another place to dump their trash.
   Seashore officials say the landfill threatens the pristine sand
dunes and scrub pine forests that form the spectacular landscape on
the tip of Cape Cod.
   The dump ``has adverse impacts on groundwater, wetlands and
ponds,'' said Andrew Ringgold, superintendent of the Cape Cod
National Seashore. ``There's windblown litter all through adjacent
areas ... It's just totally incompatible with the mission of the
National Park Service.''
   The town argues it may use the landfill under an agreement
reached in 1961 when the National Park Service established the
National Seashore _ a move that swallowed up 80 percent of
Provincetown's land area.
   The rancor over the landfill dispute has much deeper roots,
according to local and regional officials. The town has feuded with
the seashore over beach access for local fishermen driving off-road
vehicles, over the extension of a commission designed to hear local
concerns about the seashore management, and over a federal plan to
demolish dune shacks viewed by locals as historic relics.
   Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., met with Constance Harriman, an
official in the Department of Interior, regarding the landfill
dispute.
   ``Should this decision stand,'' Studds said, ``it would worsen
the already strained relationship between the town and the federal
agency.''
   Ringgold said his first responsibility is to the environmental
integrity of the seashore. But he conceded that good public
relations with the six communities that encompass the seashore are
crucial.
   ``One of my biggest responsibilities is to develop and maintain
cooperative working relationships with officials of these
communities,'' Ringgold said. But he added, ``cooperative working
relationships doesn't always mean we're going to agree on
everything.''
   Ringgold, who took over his job in November, was not around
during the earlier battles between the town and the park service.
On July 4, 1989, a parade of four-wheel-drive vehicles drove
through Provincetown to underscore the local popularity of motor
access to the dunes.
   There have been delays in recent years in receiving federal
approval for meetings of the Seashore Advisory Commission, a
sounding board for local concerns about the seashore and its
management.
   And only after a long battle did local preservationists save
dune shacks _ some of which were used by famous authors and artists
_ from demolition.
   But Ringgold said he resents the efforts by locals to portray
the seashore as a faceless bureaucracy beating up on a tiny
community.
   ``I don't think that this ought to be painted as a P.R. problem
or a battle with the town,'' Ringgold said. ``It's just an accident
of geography.''

<HEAD>Infant Seat Rule Could Increase Travel Cost For Young Families</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Air travel for families with young children
could become more costly under the airline industry's proposed
infant safety seat requirement.
   In an unusual step, the Air Transport Association asked the
Federal Aviation Administration to set a tougher requirement than
the agency itself is considering.
   The FAA on Thursday proposed regulations to require airlines to
allow passengers to use safety seats if they want to _ airlines now
have the option of barring them _ and said it would consider making
the seats mandatory after receiving public comment on the issue.
   The ATA, which represents major air carriers, wants the seats
required for all passengers under 2 years old. The ATA proposes
that the rule change go into effect a year after it is adopted.
   The proposal, if adopted by the FAA, could require thousands of
parents each day to buy tickets for children who now fly free.
Airlines, however, still would have the option of offering free
rides or reduced fares.
   ``If you buckle your children up at 50 miles per hour, why not
at 550 miles per hour?'' asked ATA President Robert Aaronson.
   He referred to laws in all states that require safety seats for
infants in automobiles. FAA rules say children under 2 may be
carried in adult airline passengers' laps.
   Airlines previously encouraged infant seat use but opposed rules
to require them.
   FAA Administrator James Busey said he welcomed the industry's
``willingness to enhance passenger safety.''
   The airline group also announced a campaign to distribute cards
advising parents to buy tickets for their youngsters and take along
car safety seats when they fly, even though they are not now
required.
   Concern over infant safety seats increased after the July 19
crash of a United Airlines DC-10 at Sioux City, Iowa, in which an
unsecured infant was among 112 people killed. Scores of other
passengers escaped.
   In the Avianca crash that killed 73 people in New York a month
ago, 17 infants were among the 159 passengers. One child was killed
and six were injured.
   Aaronson told a news conference that the 5,000 to 10,000 infants
carried by U.S. airlines daily would be ``far safer'' strapped into
car seats than in adults' laps. Nearly all car seats carry labels
saying they are approved for planes by the FAA.
   If the rule is imposed, Airlines likely would continue to accept
infants free on flights when extra seats are available, he said,
acknowledging that parents might have to pay full or discount fares
to take them on heavily booked flights.
   Asked why the industry does not adopt the infant seat
requirement on its own, Aaronson said there is a growing consensus
among airlines, medical organizations, consumer groups and others
that a uniform FAA rule would be best.
   Just before the ATA news conference, Rep. Jim Lightfoot, R-Iowa,
and Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., told a news conference they will
push legislation that would order the FAA to require the seats.
   ``If you have a corpse on an airplane, it has to be tied down,''
said Lightfoot, ``but a kid can be left to fly free around the
cabin.''
   Bond said that when he was Missouri governor he had difficulty
getting airlines to allow him to use a car seat for his infant son.
   Bond held a lifelike doll against his chest and, to demonstrate
what could happen aboard an airliner, tossed it out of his hands.
``A baby becomes a ballistic,'' he said.
   The FAA has resisted calls for tougher rules, partly because of
the cost to parents and the low number of infant casualties in
airliner accidents. A Harvard Medical School study estimated in the
early 1980s that three lives could have been saved over five years
with the use of safety seats.

   The witness was affable. He took the oath,
took the stand, winked at the defendant, stated his name, spelled
it out, ``Ronald R-E-A-G-A-N,'' and said he used to be in politics
and before that in the movies and ``prior to that I was a sports
announcer in radio.''
   But in his command performance for the cameras of the court,
Ronald Reagan had trouble remembering.
   Dates. Pictures. Documents. Memoes. Aides. Meetings.
   He is 79 years old now, and some of the events he was questioned
about took place years ago. He has always denied directing them.
   ``There were so many meetings and so many different places,'' he
said on the witness stand.
   ``I know it is tough, Mr. President,'' said lawyer Richard
Beckler.
   Asked if he had dispatched John Vessey to Central America,
Reagan had trouble identifying Vessey, who served as chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff from June 1982 to September 1985.
   Counsel: ``Could you explain to the members of the jury who
General Vessey was?''
   Reagan: ``Oh, dear. I could ask for help here. The name I know
is very familiar. I am wondering if _''
   Counsel: ``This is in connection with a trip by the Joint Chiefs
of Staff.''
   Reagan: ``Well, that _ I don't _ I don't think this was my
military aide, but obviously he was in a position to do this if he
was the chief of staff.''
   Questioned in his videotaped deposition last week, to be used in
the trial of his former national security adviser, John M.
Poindexter, Reagan was treated with deference.
   ``Mr. President,'' he was called. At one point, a lawyer went
too far _ directing the witness, ``perhaps you could tell the
jurors as much as you can remember about that whole scene right
there with Mr. Jacobson'' _ and Judge Harold Greene interrupted.
   ``No,'' said Greene, ``No, no, no, no, no. We're not here to
inquest the entire Contra affair.''
   Greene himself is a testament to the democratic system. He was
born Heinz Grunhaus in 1923 in Frankfurt an der Oder in what is now
East Germany. He presided over one of the most important cases _
the breakup of AT&amp;T _ in American commercial history.
   Now he is presiding over a trial of a former top presidential
aide charged with obstructing Congress, conspiracy and making false
statements about the sale of arms to Iran and the transfer of the
proceeds to the Contras.
   Poindexter wants to show he was following Reagan's orders.
   Reagan was generally relaxed, genial, occasionally testy. He
offered a broad wink to defendant Poindexter. He talked directly
into the camera.
   It was vintage Reagan: a man of iron conviction on the big
picture, but fading on the details.
   He told anew of Lenin's plot to take over Eastern Europe, then
``the hordes of Asia,'' then Latin America so America would be left
alone, ``the last bastion of capitalism.''
   But he was rusty about the role of Col. Oliver North. Asked what
he thought North had been doing, he said: ``You have to have people
that can be available to make contact with the leaders of the
Contras and so forth, sometimes closer than just writing a letter.
... It was my understanding because his name would crop up in memos
and so forth that that's what he was doing.''
   He was asked if he remembered what position Rep. Lee Hamilton,
D-Ind., took on Contra aid when he ran the House Intelligence
Committee.
   ``I don't recall what position he was taking or where he was.
There are 435 of them, remember.''
   He was asked about a meeting with a European prime minister.
   ``Since I met with 400 heads of state, heads of government,
foreign ministers and so forth in the eight years, no I can't
recall what I particularly said to any of them.''
   He was asked if he remembered reading a memo which bore his
initials on the bottom.
   He said the papers generated in his White House were numerous.
``There are 50 million pieces of paper.''
   He was asked if he recalled meeting Contra leader Adolfo Calero,
who posed with him in a White House picture.
   ``I hate to keep throwing figures at you,'' he said, ``but I
have been told that because of the business of our Hollywood
photographers, I have got something over a million photos of people
that came in there as visitors.''

   Here are some of the highlights from former
President Reagan's testimony for John Poindexter's upcoming trial
in the Iran-Contra affair:
   _Reagan said he never ``had any inkling'' his aides were
secretly arming the Nicaraguan Contras.
   _He said he remained unconvinced there had been a diversion of
Iran arms sale money to the rebels until prosecutors confronted him
with the report of the Tower Commission he appointed.
   _Reagan said he would have expected Poindexter, his former
national security adviser, to inform him of any diversion of funds
to the Contras ``unless maybe he thought he was protecting me from
something.''
   _Reagan said he agreed with a letter Poindexter sent to Congress
saying the White House was complying with the congressional ban on
help for the Contras _ a letter that forms part of the basis for
one charge Poindexter faces. However, Reagan said he was unfamiliar
with references in the letter to earlier denials that North was
raising funds or supplying the Contras with military advice.
   _During cross-examination, prosecutors introduced evidence that
Poindexter lied to Reagan about the secret aid operation after a
C-123 cargo plane was shot down over Nicaragua during a supply
flight on Oct. 5, 1986. In written interrogatories to the
Iran-Contra grand jury earlier, Reagan said Poindexter first told
him that the sole survivor of the crash, Eugene Hasenfus, was not
connected with the U.S. government.
   _Reagan may have helped Poindexter by testifying that he could
not recall when he knew about a November 1985 shipment of Hawk
missiles to Iran. The shipment figures in four of the five criminal
charges against Poindexter. Poindexter is accused of telling
Congress in November 1986 that U.S. officials didn't find out that
Hawks were aboard the 1985 shipment until January 1986.

   The city wants ``Oh! Calcutta!,''
Broadway's long-running nude revue, to bare all somewhere else.
   Officials filed suit Thursday in Hamilton County Chancery Court
to block the showing of ``Oh! Calcutta!'' at the Tivoli Theater on
grounds the musical is obscene and lewd.
   ``Oh! Calcutta!,'' the second-longest Broadway musical with
5,959 performances, raised eyebrows and was threatened with banning
when it opened in 1969, when nudity on stage and screen was still
something of a novelty.
   Many critics consider ``Oh! Calcutta!'' a fairly tame show, but
its current six-month tour of more than 90 cities has shown the
passions it aroused 20 years ago still linger.
   On Feb. 7, the city authorities of Springfield, Mo., forced the
actors to wear bras, flesh-colored underwear and G-strings during a
performance before 5,000 people _ the first time the Calcutta cast
had been clad.
   A Chattanooga promoter wants to stage the play May 2 or May 6,
but the Memorial Auditorium Board, which runs the Tivoli, voted
last week against bringing in the production.
   Al Stewart, spokesman for the musical's promoter, Singer
Entertainment Consultants of Port Murray, N.J., said the play was
not obscene.
   ``Something that has been around for 21 years and has played in
15 countries before 60 million people, I wouldn't go that far ...
to say it is obscene,'' said Stewart. ``It is done in art. It's
theater.''
   City Attorney Randy Nelson said the board ``just wants to do
what it feels is best for the community and have shows that are in
tune with community tastes.''
   The 10-page lawsuit contends the musical violates the state's
obscenity law, as well as state and local laws against indecent
exposure and a local ordinance against lewd and indecent conduct.
The musical includes simulated intercourse.
   Officials filed the lawsuit because the Tivoli is publicly owned
and can only deny use if an event violates local laws or business
criteria.
   It is not the first time in recent history that city officials
tried to ban a theatrical production. In 1975, an effort to block a
production of the rock musical ``Hair'' went all the way to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
   The justices did not rule on whether ``Hair'' was obscene, but
they did strike down the ban on grounds that officials did not have
sufficient evidence to halt the play.
   ``The reason the city lost the `Hair' case was, they (banned the
play) without first-hand information. They did so on hearsay,''
said David Johnson, manager of the Tivoli. ``Here, they have read
the actual script of this particular presentation.''

   There are 270 dead sheep, 100 aborted
calves, six sick people, traces of chemicals and sightings of a
mysterious crop duster airplane.
   And while some tantalizing hints have been raised, no one really
knows the solution to this rural whodunit in southeastern
Washington's cattle and potato-growing country.
   ``How to poison that many animals that fast is still a
mystery,'' said Clarke Brown, a state Department of Agriculture
investigator. ``For that many to get poisoned without finding the
obvious source is extremely unusual.''
   Investigators are focusing on two farm chemicals but say they
don't account for all the problems. In fact, they say the animal
deaths, which occurred in adjacent fields, could be unrelated.
   According to the investigators, some evidence was initially
withheld by witnesses, and so much time passed before a
veterinarian was called after the mid-January cow abortions that
any chemical traces had disappeared.
   ``All I know is a bunch of cattle died, and sheep,'' said Len
McIrvin, the rancher who lost 15 cows and about 100 calves in the
spontaneous abortions.
   One possible culprit, the Hanford nuclear weapons plant, has
been ruled out by investigators. The government plant, the most
contaminated nuclear waste site in the nation, is a few miles west
of Burbank.
   Its proximity seems to have made residents of the Snake River
town of 700 immune to sudden panic. ``We've lived around a nuclear
plant all our lives,'' John Hash of Burbank said. ``Why worry about
a few sheep dying?''
   Investigators admit they may never know the full story.
   ``I've been involved in looking at cases for 15 years and I've
never seen anything like it,'' said Lynden Baum, an investigator
for the state Department of Health.
   This much is known:
   _ About 270 sheep were found dead in a field near Burbank on
Nov. 21. Investigators have ruled out overeating, bad water, weeds
or diseases. Tests of the animals' stomach fluids found traces of
the pesticide aldicarb, used to kill insects in potatoes.
   Investigators don't know how the chemical got there, but there
is some suspicion that the sheep may have eaten from bags of
aldicarb that had not yet been used, Brown said.
   ``The bags were not mentioned for the first full week. We were
well into the investigation when we learned that some bags were out
there,'' Brown said.
   The only known farm chemicals being applied at the time the
sheep died was Telone, used to control worms in potatoes. It was
found in the kidney of only one sampled sheep, Brown said.
   _ Six people who traveled in the vicinity of the field that day
have reported becoming ill with respiratory problems. Three are
still reporting breathing problems, the Agriculture Department
said. ``We don't know what hurt the people,'' Baum said.
   _ One dead Hereford cow was found in an adjacent field the day
after the sheep died, along with signs that four pregnant cows had
aborted. In mid-January, two weeks before the calving season, about
half the 226 heifers on McIrvin's nearby Diamond M Ranch had
miscarriages. The normal miscarriage rate that late would be almost
zero, McIrvin said. About 15 cows also died in January.
   Ranchers did not call a veterinarian into the case until last
week, Brown said. By then it was impossible to find traces of
chemicals in the animals, he said.
   ``We assumed what was killing the sheep killed the cattle,''
McIrvin said.
   _ A ranch employee who became ill waited several months before
reporting the sighting of a propeller-driven airplane dropping a
white powder near the cows on Nov. 21. Others nearby saw no
airplane. Officials aren't sure why the plane was not reported
before.

   Prince Charles makes it plain as the nose on
his royal face that he isn't very fond of modern British
architecture. What then, an American asked, does he think of
Washington's gleaming new skyline of glass and steel?
   The 41-year-old heir to the British throne rocked on his heels
at the embassy reception Thursday, paused a long moment and smiled
mischievously. ``I prefer Paris,'' he said.
   His reply foreshadowed the indictment of modern urban design
that he delivered a few hours later at a black-tie awards gala of
the American Institute of Architects at the National Building
Museum, where roast beef was served by candlelight at $250 a plate.
   If the 1,200 architects and their guests wanted their dessert
laced with princely scorn, Charles scorn, Charles didn't disappoint
them.
   ``Much of the commercial building of today bears as much
relation to architecture as advertising slogans bear to
literature,'' he said, charging that their designers ``ransack
history as if it were a wardrobe full of old clothes.''
   Charles challenged American architects to reverse the trend
toward cities that are ``the epitome of the throwaway society'' _
torn down and rebuilt by successive generations _ and design
buildings of lasting beauty that are fit for human beings.
   ``It sometimes seems to me that the richer we get, the uglier we
tend to make our surroundings,'' he said. ``What is worse, not only
do we seem to have mislaid the ability to create beauty, but we
also set out to destroy what beauty there is left in the world.''
   The prince said his invitation to speak was mystifying,
considering his criticism of the ``Frankenstein monsters'' created
by some British architects. ``Is there an epidemic of masochism
sweeping the ranks of the AIA?'' he asked. The audience roared.
   Charles' speech was the highlight of a one-day Washington visit
that also included lunch with President Bush and his top advisers
at the White House, a visit to AIA headquarters and a British
Embassy reception.
   Outside the banquet hall, about two dozen protesters stood
behind police lines silently holding placards demanding withdrawal
of British troops from Northern Ireland.
   But Charles was greeted by friendly demonstrators when he
arrived at the AIA's Octagon Museum in midafternoon to open an
exhibition of artifacts from Sir Christopher Wren's design and
construction of St. Paul's Cathedral in London.
   ``Gee, whiz,'' Charles said as he emerged from his Rolls-Royce
limousine and saw picketers waving signs that read, ``Our Knight in
Shining Armor'' and ``Humane Architecture _ Happy People.''
   As he left AIA headquarters, the prince shook hands with
10-year-old Christopher Wren of Chevy Chase, Md., whose mother,
Sherry, said he decided to become an architect when he learned
about his famous 17th century English namesake.
   ``I hear you're a practicing architect,'' Charles said.
   ``Well, I'd like to be someday,'' young Christopher replied,
adding that he already had a drafting table and a portfolio of
designs.
   ``It was really neat meeting him,'' the boy said after Charles
left for the embassy reception honoring alumni of the Marshall
Scholars program.
   Under the program that began in 1954, a small group of
exceptional American students _ currently 30 each year _ are chosen
to spend two or three years at British universities, with all
expenses paid by the British government.
   Charles urged the alumni to ``use the power of the lobby'' to
carry out his goals of improving education, protecting the
environment and encouraging private investment to revitalize
deteriorating urban neighborhoods.
   Embassy sources said the prince's luncheon discussion with Bush
dealt with environmental concerns and Charles' plan to visit
Hungary in early May. One purpose of that trip, they said, will be
to explore opportunities for private investments aimed to building
a free-market economy in that country.
   Charles returns to London today after meeting at the embassy
with a group of U.S. environmental experts.

<HEAD>Ag Department Sees Farmers Sowing More Debt This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The typical farmer may be ready to buy
something new for the first time in seven years instead of paying
off old debts.
   It could be additional land, machinery or other items needed to
produce crops and livestock, says the Agriculture Department. In
any case, the purchases probably will require at least some
borrowed money.
   Farm debt nationally is expected to grow slightly in 1990,
ending an unprecedented paydown that began in the mid-1980s. For
most farmers, there was little choice as heavy debt loads and
declining land values shrank their options.
   But now, after several years of financial recovery, the
department's Economic Research Service says 1990 will be a turning
point and farm debt will grow again.
   Economist Jerry Stam said Thursday it will be a ``real weak''
turnaround, certainly not the thunderous kickoff of another boom
era. That happened in the 1970s, when soaring farmland prices and
quick credit convinced thousands of farmers prosperity was around
the corner.
   It wasn't, and in the early 1980s the financial crunch was on.
As land values plummeted, so did credit ratings and farmers had to
reorganize to survive. Paying off some of the old debt was part of
the drill.
   Total U.S. farm debt peaked at $192.7 billion in 1983, more than
double what it was a decade earlier.
   Since 1983, farm debt has declined for six straight years to an
estimated $135.6 billion in 1989, at $57.1 billion the biggest
paydown on record.
   Now, Stam said, ``The lenders are really competing for
top-quality loans, so they're starting to fight over market share
again.''
   ``But the farmers have so adjusted to the way they're operating
that I don't see any great change (in total debt). It wouldn't
surprise me if it didn't do much at all,'' he said.
   Until the six-year paydown, there had been only one year _ 1953
_ since 1945 in which farm debt did not increase. The figures by
themselves are boggling. In 1945, farmers owed $6.7 billion. It
took until 1977 for farm debt to top $100 billion.
   The figures do not include ``operator household'' debt owed for
consumer items such as cars, furniture and other family items
bought on credit.
   Stam said an end to farm debt increases in 1990 depend on a
number of factors, including farmland values, net cash income and
decisions by farmers to buy additional land or replace worn
machinery.
   The record $57.1 paydown in the six years after farm debt peaked
in 1983 was also spurred by writeoffs of bad loans by major
lenders, Stam said. In all, those totaled about $13.8 billion.
   Stam said the Farmers Home Administration accounted for about
half of the writeoffs, with commercial banks and the Farm Credit
System the remainder.
   The historical upward creep of farm debt, culminating in the
recent tumble, is not necessarily an indicator of good times or bad
for farmers.
   ``I think you have to compare it with income, cash flow and a
lot of other things,'' he said. ``Of course, in the condition we
had in the '70s everybody said it was a good thing to leverage and
all that. We got fooled. It's neither good nor bad by itself.''
   Stam said that in the final analysis, farmers must have enough
cash flow to cover expenses. But, he added, ``In modern
agriculture, it's hard to operate without the use of debt capital.''

   An Agriculture Department analysis shows
cattle producers are headed for another year of record-high market
prices. And consumers will pay more for burgers, steaks and chops.
   Total beef production by slaughter plants is expected to rise
about 2 percent because of increased cattle marketings and heavier
weights, the department's Economics Research Service said Thursday.
   But an expanding U.S. population and increases in net beef
exports will more than offset the larger output, the report said.
That will mean less beef available on a per capita basis.
   Consequently, market prices of Choice-grade fed steers sold on
the Omaha, Neb., market in 1990 may average about $1 more than last
year's record of $72.50 per pound, the report said. That would push
retail prices up 1 percent to 3 percent.
   Hog prices also are going up and may average in the range of $47
to $53 per 100 pounds in 1990, compared with a little more than $44
last year at the major markets.
   ``Retail pork prices have risen in recent months, reflecting
higher hog prices and wider farm-to-retail (marketing) spreads,''
the report said. ``Retail pork prices for the year may increase 6
percent to 8 percent from last year.''

   Production of farm-grown catfish continues to
rise from year-earlier levels, but the Agriculture Department says
prices paid to growers are down.
   Processors turned out 33.1 million pounds of catfish in January,
up 23 percent from a year earlier, a monthly report said. Prices
paid to growers for fish delivered to plants averaged 73 cents per
pound, down five cents from January 1989.

   Vice President Dan Quayle told a
gathering of Republican members of Congress that the revolutions in
Eastern Europe were a testament to American democracy, but he said
American society was troubled.
   The United States is confronting a growing underclass of
impoverished, single-parent households that threatens the workforce
of tomorrow _ a labor pool that will have to be highly trained and
educated, Quayle said Thursday night.
   His speech was briefly interupted when several hecklers shouted
from the balcony, ``Stop the killing'' and ``Dan Quayle, there is
blood on your hands,'' apparently in reference to American
involvement in Central America.
   Two of the hecklers were arrested, charged with disorderly
conduct and disrupting a meeting and later released. A third
demonstrator was detained when he allegedly lunged at Quayle
outside the building where the speech was held.
   Quayle said 15 million children are growing up in homes with no
father, 25 percent of the nation's children live in single-parent
households, and a majority of black children live with only one
parent.
   ``How will we compete with Japan and Germany and other nations
that do not have this underclass?'' he said to a gathering of about
200. ``How will we produce a skilled workforce without
strengthening the family structure.''
   Quayle's speech opened a retreat of Republican members of
Congress sponsored by The Congressional Institute.
   The Institute is a Republican think tank set up several years
ago to study public policy issues. The Princeton conference is
focusing on long-range economic, social and demographic changes.
   ``The revolution of 1989 was no accident. It erupted from a
swelling realization that Democratic values are the wave of the
future, economic freedom generates wealth, and political freedom is
a requisite for peace and prosperity,'' Quayle said.
   ``The Cold War is not over but its funeral is close,'' he said.
   A protest outside the hall was waged by activists for homosexual
rights, AIDS research, a stop to American involvement in Panama and
Central America, and abortion rights.
   As he left the auditorium, Quayle greeted some of the
protesters, one of whom was grabbed by police after lunging at the
vice president, said Princeton police.
   Christopher Paciorek, an 18-year-old Princeton University
student, was released with a complaint summons, police said.

   U.S. officials are confused over a Soviet
proposal for troop cuts that they say is a step backward from an
earlier agreement.
   Soviet negotiators in Vienna suggested Thursday the East and
West blocs agree to a ceiling of 700,000 and 750,000 soldiers each
in Central Europe, say American and East German diplomats.
   But U.S. and Soviet officials involved in the conventional force
reduction talks already had agreed not to set an overall ceiling
and instead to limit the Americans to 225,000 and the Soviets to
195,000 troops in Europe.
   ``We are so confused we cannot be indignant,'' said one
administration source in Washington, commenting on the latest
Soviet suggestion. He spoke on condition he not be further
identified.
   Soviet envoys floated the idea as a suggestion but met with such
opposition they decided not to make it a formal proposal, the
official said.
   ``They could not even get their Warsaw Pact allies to agree to
it. And the Western response was, `this is a non-starter,''' said
the official.
   The issue of troop levels in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact has been complicated by
the announcement by three members of the Eastern Bloc,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, that they were cutting the
armed forces.
   The Soviets and East Germans argue the combination of troop cuts
would leave NATO with a maximum of 1 million soldiers, compared to
700,000 for the Warsaw Pact.
   ``That situation is totally unsatisfactory,'' Ernst told
reporters in Vienna. Ernst said the overall ceiling suggested by
the Kremlin would include national armies and Soviet troops
stationed on foreign soil.
   Last week, Soviet and American officials cleared the way for the
16 NATO and seven Warsaw Pact nations to sign a conventional force
reduction agreement by the end of the year, as proposed by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Under that deal, the Soviet Union and United States would reduce
to 195,000 each their forces stationed in Germany, Belgium,
Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and
Poland.
   Another 30,000 U.S. soldiers would be allowed in Britain and
southern Europe to compensate for the distance between the United
States and Europe.
   Hungary and Czechoslovakia are negotiating for total withdrawal
of Soviet forces from their territory. About 50,000 Soviet troops
are in Hungary and 75,000 in Czechoslovakia.
   The alliances have not agreed on how to define some types of
weapons to be covered in the proposed pact, or on rules for
counting attack aircraft.

   Former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
says it is too soon to seek a ``peace dividend'' because of the
fall of communist regimes in Eastern Europe and warming relations
with the Soviet Union.
   Accepting the annual ``Statesman of the Year'' award at George
Washington University on Thursday, Weinberger said, ``I think it is
vital that we remember that it was a strong defense and a greatly
strengthened defense that led to a lot of these changes.''
   Weinberger led the Pentagon during most of the Reagan
administration, a period that saw a large increase in American
military spending.
   Reagan and his supporters argued it was the military buildup
that forced the Soviets to seek accommodation.
   ``It's awfully early for us to assume that things are such that
we can, in effect, dismantle the military strength that helped
bring the situation about and hunt around for a peace dividend,''
Weinberger said.
   He said any such shift of money from the military, ``is not
going to be used to reduce our deficit; it will be used for ...
federal programs that are perceived to be more popular'' than
military spending.
   The former secretary said the Soviets ``have not yet dismantled
their military. What they are doing is taking out their oldest
tanks and oldest artillery and oldest planes and their oldest
nuclear weapons and they are modernizing all of those categories.
   ``And the Soviet Union remains the only country in the world
that can destroy the United States overnight,'' he said.
   Weinberger also argued that Americans ``ought to worry a little
bit about the effect on our economy of these very deep cuts.''
   ``You don't do a defense budget because it's a very good jobs
bill,'' he said. ``You don't do it to help the economy. It does not
hurt the economy, however.
   ``The fact is that the defense spending we did was a substantial
help to the economy, and if you reduce the armed forces sizably and
if you stop weapons systems you are going to affect employment.''
   Weinberger, now publisher of Forbes magazine, was the third
person to receive the statesmanship award. It is presented by the
alumni association of the school of government and business
administration and by the National Law Center at the university.
   The previous recipients were Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and former Secretary of State George P.
Shultz.

<HEAD>Parties Line Up on Opposite Sides in Campaign Finance Reform</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A veteran Senate Republican says his party
will fight against strict campaign spending limits because the
curbs would favor the majority Democrats.
   ``It's not going to happen,'' Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said
Thursday as the Senate Rules Committee began hearings on the
politically divisive issue of campaign finance reform.
   Stevens, the ranking Republican on the committee, told two
Democratic witnesses that spending curbs on all candidates would
allow incumbents to win ``99 percent of the time.'' Challengers, he
said, have to outspend incumbents to win elections.
   ``I don't think our side of the aisle is going to change,'' he
said, while Democrats control the Senate 55-45 and the House
257-175.
   Stevens suggested Democrats drop proposals for spending limits
and public financing, and pass legislation that would curb mailing,
broadcast fees and other costs that would win wide bipartisan
support.
   Stevens added public financing wouldn't curb runaway costs
because the government money would only become a substitute for
private donations.
   But Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz. and Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan.
told the committee campaign spending limits and public financing
were essential to any agreement on campaign finance reform.
   DeConcini, testifying on a bill he introduced this week, told
the panel, ``Reform without spending limits is no reform at all.
From 1976 to 1986 the cost of running a Senate campaign didn't
double, didn't triple, but increased fivefold.''
   DeConcini's proposal, which would apply only to the Senate,
would base general election spending limits on a state's voting age
population. The general election limit would be no lower than
$400,000 and no more than $5.5 million. The primary limit would be
50 percent of the general election figure.
   ``Fully half of the Senate races would be kept below $1.5
million for the total spending cycle,'' DeConcini said. He conceded
the figure was high but said it would be ``a great improvement''
over the average of $3.7 million in 1988.
   A formula based on the amount of small contributions received
would determine the amount of public financing.
   ``This would substantially reduce the amount of time a candidate
is forced to spend on fund-raising, and would return the focus of a
campaign to the issues of the day,'' DeConcini said.
   Glickman backed DeConcini and urged that spending limits and
public financing also apply to House races.
   ``A potential challenger often must be a millionaire in order to
stand a chance against a sitting incumbent,'' Glickman said, noting
``most of my colleagues in the House have few serious challengers.''

<HEAD>`Peace Dividend' Should be Used to Cut Deficit: Governors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Governors would like more federal money for
education, health care, transportation and repairing bridges and
roads. But most of the state officials say they'd just as soon see
any ``peace dividend'' used to reduce the federal deficit.
   With few exceptions, the governors responding to an Associated
Press survey said they expect defense spending to drop as a result
of the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe where communist regimes
have crumbled in recent months.
   They sounded much more confident that federal funds would be
freed for domestic needs than has President Bush or his budget
director, Richard G. Darman.
   Gov. William Donald Schaefer, a Democrat from Maryland, has
drafted a letter to congressional leaders urging that any defense
savings be used to ``ease the pain of transition for the workers
and businesses most affected by the reductions.''
   An aide to Schaefer said Thursday that several other governors,
including Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, Richard Celeste of Ohio
and L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, were joining the Maryland
governor in the appeal.
   Schaefer hoped to use the annual winter meeting of the National
Governors' Association, opening Saturday, to argue his case.
   Schaefer wants money for retraining displaced workers,
increasing research and development, and rebuilding the nation's
infrastructure.
   Bush has brushed aside suggestions that a substantial ``peace
dividend'' is in the offing.
   ``Many speak of the peace dividend. Few discuss the short-term
cost of peace,'' he said in an address to the Commonwealth Club in
San Francisco earlier this month.
   ``There will be costs as we cross the bridge to a better
future,'' he added.
   In an introduction to the Bush's 1991 budget, Darman, director
of the Office of Management and Budget, said people were
overestimating the dividend. He portrayed members of Congress as
devising spending plans that would total ``about 10 times the
overestimated dividend.''
   Gov. Buddy Roemer of Louisiana, a Democrat, predicted the
savings from reduced military spending could total $100 billion
over the next three years.
   ``The thing that can help Louisiana the most is to lower the
deficit,'' he said.
   ``There's no question there's going to be a dividend if you're
using that term in the sense that the defense budget will come
down,'' said Republican Gov. William Clements of Texas, a former
deputy defense secretary.
   Arguing that any such savings should go toward reducing the
deficit, Clements said, ``The proliferation of our domestic
programs is a no-no as far as I'm concerned.''
   Clements' emphasis on reducing the budget deficit was echoed in
the responses of most of the governors.
   ``First and foremost, we should reduce the national budget
deficit,'' said Republican George Deukmejian of California.
   ``Any peace dividend should go primarily to balancing the
budget,'' said Democrat George Sinner of North Dakota.
   A few governors were hesitant about advocating sharp cuts in
defense spending.
   ``I believe the peace dividend is probably overstated,'' said
Gov. Mike Hayden, a Republican from Kansas. ``If there is one, it
should be used to lower the deficit.''
   Republican Gov. Stan Stephens of Montana warned against getting
``carried away with the euphoria of what is happening in Eastern
Europe.''
   Stephens said that if there was a peace dividend it should be
used to lower taxes. ``It belongs to the people,'' he said. ``I
think we should give the taxpayers of this country a break.''
   Among the dissenters from the call for earmarking the money for
deficit reduction were Govs. Robert Casey of Pennsylvania and Neil
Goldschmidt of Oregon, both Democrats.
   Goldschmidt called for ``shifting resources to those things we
care about in life _ arts, science, health, education and, above
all, children.''
   ``As billions are pared from the Pentagon budget, it's time for
the federal government to return a substantial portion of that
dividend to the states,'' said Casey.
   He singled out mass transit as an area where federal funds are
needed. He said the budget proposed by Bush includes no money for
the Philadelphia area transit system, which was receiving $27.4
million this year.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the opening of the Berlin Wall, West
Germans are crossing the border to press thousands of claims on
land or buildings East Germans live in.
   The claims may even affect some of East Berlin's most important
public buildings. They are another reminder of the difficulty of
uniting the two Germanys despite recent political progress.
   According to the Hamburg-based newsmagazine Spiegel, the East
German Foreign Ministry is built on land claimed by a West Berlin
lawyer, and the ground below East Berlin's huge TV reception tower
is claimed by a Swiss insurance company.
   At least 500,000 West Germans have claims on buildings or land
in East Germany that was confiscated with little or no compensation
by Communist authorities, West German officials say.
   Many of those making claims escaped to the West during the
postwar Soviet occupation or after Communist East Germany was
founded. Others are the children of refugees or West Germans who
have inherited property from relatives in the East.
   Now, after years of silence, some of those owners are trying to
get their possessions back.
   The issue rests on complicated legal ground and could lead to
lawsuits, authorities on both sides of the border say.
   ``A whole morass of property problems is coming down on us that
we'll somehow have to solve,'' said Jutta Probst, a spokeswoman for
the Gesamtdeutsches Institut in West Berlin. The institute is a
branch of the Bonn government that monitors East Germany.
   A special commission has been set up with representatives from
both German governments to consider property disputes, Ms. Probst
said in an interview.
   ``Aggression is mounting on both sides, from the owners who want
their property back on the one hand and East Germans who fear the
consequences on the other,'' she said. Most of the confiscated
property is owned or controlled by the East German government.
   But officials say that little can be done before East Germany's
first free elections set for March 18 and the replacement of state
ownership with private property.
   Meanwhile, confrontations between West German owners and their
tenants across the border are becoming increasingly common.
   ``Several of my friends have had owners from the West suddenly
drop by and are really frightened now,'' said Liselotte Nikolenko,
an East Berlin retiree.
   ``They're worried that either their rents will be hiked so high
they can't pay or they'll be forced out because the owner decides
to do something else with his property,'' Ms. Nikolenko said.
   Deputy Mayor Reinhild Zagrodnik said ``hundreds of calls daily''
are coming in from worried renters.
   ``There have been incidents of owners just appearing on the
doorstep, and there were _ I'll put it very politely _
discussions,'' she said.
   Spiegel, in the Feb. 12 article entitled ``Fear of Rent
Sharks,'' said a West German homeowner had armed himself with a
special spray to fend off his East German tenant's ferocious dog.
   Fear of rent increases is well founded. Held down by the
government to immediate postwar levels, rents are inexpensive even
by East German standards. An East German employee rarely spends
even 10 percent of his monthly income on rent.
   The West German government has paid $3.2 billion in compensation
to people and companies who have lost property in East Germany, a
spokesman of the Federal Compensation Office in Bad Homburg said.
Those payments, however, have not covered all claims.
   Any people who later recover property have to pay back
compensation, the office said.

   The Pentagon should delay buying the B-2
bomber until it is certain the aircraft can pass critical flight
tests, says an investigative agency that forecasts the program will
cost more than its estimated $70 billion.
   In its first unclassified report on the radar-evading aircraft,
the General Accounting Office said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is
reviewing a revised cost estimate for the program due to changes in
the inflation rate and a recent strike at the Boeing Co., a major
subcontractor.
   ``We estimate that the changes will add another several billion
dollars to the B-2's estimated cost,'' said Frank C. Conahan,
assistant comptroller general and a member of the GAO, the
investigative arm of Congress.
   Questioned after the House Armed Services Committee hearing
about the increase, Conahan said that due to inflation, the revised
five-year plan for defense spending beginning in fiscal 1992 shows
a jump of $51 billion for all defense programs.
   Conahan said he did not know how much of the $51 billion was for
the stealth bomber.
   The Air Force was forced to raise the cost of buying 132 B-2
bombers due to a redesign of the plane to enable it to fly at low
altitudes, extensions in the production schedule and underestimates
of material costs.
   In 1981, the service said the planes would cost $32.7 billion,
but by june 1989 the cost had risen to $70 billion.
   The GAO official also told the committee the cost of the
electronic navigation and communications systems for the B-2 had
increased from $1.9 billion in 1986 to $5.7 billion in 1989.
   The GAO recommended Cheney and the plane's contractor, Northrop
Corp., analyze the cost of a production delay and provide Congress
with the study of alternative plans for acquiring the plane.
   The bat-winged, stealth bomber is considered the most expensive
in history at $530 million apiece.
   ``We believe that it would be prudent to reduce the pace of
funding and production for the B-2, to limit up-front investment
until the critical performance elements of the aircraft are
adequately evaluated,'' Conahan said.
   The GAO official said he did not have any estimates on what a
production delay would cost, but several members of the panel said
Northrop Corp., has determined a one-year slowdown would cost $4.2
billion.
   Rep. Norman Dicks, D-Wash., a guest of the committee, lashed out
at Conahan's assessment for failing to include the cost to the
American taxpayer of a production delay.
   ``Why don't you go back and do the job right,'' said Dicks,
whose district includes the Boeing Co.
   ``We have responded to what we were asked to do,'' Conahan
answered.
   Dicks said Congress already scaled back the program in fiscal
1990 when it reduced the Bush administration's request for three
bombers to two and trimmed about $400 million from the program.
   The administration, in its $292 billion defense budget for the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, has requested $5.5 billion for five
B-2 stealth bombers.
   Under the current plan, critical performance tests on the
aircraft won't be done for at least three years.
   ``It has been during this critical performance testing that
significant performance problems have been discovered in other
advanced weapon system programs,'' Conahan said.
   The buying schedule during that testing period raised concerns
among the committee members.
   ``We would have bought 31 aircraft and spent $48 billion and we
won't know whether it's performing,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
chairman of the Armed Services Committee.
   ``This flyway robbery is being done of the taxpayers money ...
$48 billion before we have any idea whether the B-2 aircraft is
going to work,'' said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a member of
the panel, said on the House floor.

<HEAD>Investment in Eastern Europe Driving Up Interest Rates, Says Fed
Chairman</HEAD>

   Investors flocking to take part in tremendous
investment opportunities in Eastern Europe are driving up long-term
interest rates around the world, Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Alan Greenspan says.
   However, the central bank chairman said the trend probably won't
continue.
   Greenspan, presenting the central bank's semiannual report to
Congress on Thursday, said money is flowing to nations emerging
from 40 years of communist rule because ``the potential for growth
is extraordinary.''
   The resulting competition is driving up interest rates in the
United States and other countries. Long-term rates started heading
up in early January, with the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond hitting a
nine-month high of 8.66 percent on Tuesday.
   ``This is an extraordinary change in the nature of world savings
and investment and I don't think it has any exact historical
precedent,'' he said. ``It's the most important financial issue of
the decade.''
   But Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee rates probably
would not continue rising unless some currently unknown need for
investment is revealed.
   ``There is a very general knowledge of the size of the potential
investment and I would suspect that most of the information about
this is already in the markets. Hence, unless something
fundamentally new occurs ... I'm not that concerned that interest
rates would just continue up,'' he said.
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the committee,
said that by relying on foreigners to help finance trade and
federal budget deficits, the United States is in danger of losing
control over domestic interest rates and of its economy in general.
   ``I must tell you I think we are boxing ourselves in,'' he said.
Riegle said research by his staff shows foreigners last fall held
about 20 percent of outstanding U.S. government debt, up from 15
percent five years earlier.

   Winter Carnival organizers here in the

   The 1960s movie, ``Back to the Beach,'' starring Frankie Avalon
and Annette Funicello, will be projected against a 15-foot-high
snowbank in Valdez's civic center parking lot on March 11, right
after a fireworks display.
   ``The idea came from two of the staff members at the civic

said Thursday. ``One of them was just driving by one day and
noticed a sharply cut snowbank and came up with the idea.''
   This season's snowfall of 423 inches _ over 35 feet _ already

winter, the National Weather Service said.

   The campaign posters, stickers and buttons

   The shoppers who came to the Building 19 store this week bought

   The thousands of items included an old-style newspaper stand,
campaign paraphernalia bearing the name Kennedy, typewriters and

   ``You name it. Whatever you saw in the movie, and most of it is

<HEAD>Dole Will Keep Pushing for Vote on Armenian Genocide Resolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole says he'll
keep pressing his reluctant colleagues for a floor vote on a
resolution to designate a day commemorating an Armenian genocide.
   Dole, R-Kan., failed to cut off debate on the controversial
measure Thursday as the Senate refused by a 49-49 vote to break a
filibuster. Sixty votes are needed to invoke cloture.
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., led a filibuster for three days,
arguing the resolution could irreparably damage U.S. relations with
Turkey, a member of NATO.
   ``Senate approval of this resolution would offend a trusted and
loyal ally ... an ally that protects NATO's southern flank, an ally
that provides access to a variety of important military
facilities,'' Byrd said.
   Another cloture vote is scheduled next Tuesday. If he fails to
break the filibuster and bring the measure to the Senate floor,
Dole has said he'll try to find other ways to force a vote on the
resolution.
   The House might be able to tackle a companion bill or ``perhaps
creative minds can concoct an amendment to some upcoming bill,'' he
said.
   Addressing senators who may want to skirt a vote on the
resolution by keeping it off the floor, Dole said: ``I hate to
burst any bubbles, but _ to paraphrase a comment a champion boxer
once made about his opponent _ you can run, but you can't hide.''
   Democrats and Republicans showed little party loyalty on the
procedural vote.
   The Bush administration opposes the resolution, although it is
favored by Dole and several GOP senators, such as Pete Wilson of
California and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.
   Members of Byrd's party also went against him, including Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine and Claiborne Pell of
Rhode Island, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   The resolution would designate April 24 as a ``national day of
remembrance'' of the ``Armenian genocide of 1915-1923.''
   A massacre of 1.5 million Armenians allegedly occurred in the
Ottoman Empire before the establishment of the Republic of Turkey.
But the Turks contend at most 600,000 Armenians died, some of
disease, famine or attacks by marauding bands during World War I.
   Although Dole said he is willing to compromise on language in
the resolution _ the Turks are furious about the word ``genocide''
_ he said he won't sacrifice principles.
   The Bush administration, meantime, issued a statement saying it
opposed the Senate resolution because it ``lacks balance.''
Officials said President Bush would veto it if it passed both the
Senate and the House. A companion measure is in a House committee.
   The administration said it ``supports commemorating the victims
of that tragic period. Such a commemorative resolution must be
balanced, however, in recognition of the differing views of how the
terrible events of 1915-1923 should be characterized.''
   Turkish officials call the resolution a national insult,
objected strenuously to the word ``genocide'' and threatened to
retaliate if the measure passes.
   In Ankara, Premier Yildirim Akbulut did not specify what Turkey
would do, but added: ``The United States will lose its respected
position in the eyes of the Turkish people.''

   Only four states _ Hawaii, Mississippi, South
Dakota and Vermont _ have enough unemployment insurance in reserve
to maintain jobless benefits for 18 months in a severe recession,
congressional auditors say.
   And only 22 state programs could survive a year without raising
unemployment compensation taxes, curtailing eligibility or
borrowing heavily from the federal government, as they did in the
last downturn in 1981-82.
   Three states _ Illinois, Michigan and Ohio _ with the highest
concentration of the manufacturing workers who would be most
subject to layoffs in a recession have reserves of six months or
less, a House subcommittee was told Thursday.
   Nonetheless, the Bush administration and the National Governors
Association told the panel they oppose a bill by House tax writers
to raise the federal unemployment insurance taxable wage base from
$7,000 to $10,000 by 1993.
   ``We see no programmatic justification for such an increase,''
Deputy Assistant Labor Secretary Carolyn Golding told the House
Ways and Means Committee's subcommittee on human resources.
   She testified that as of Dec. 1, overall state accounts had
reserves totalling nearly $38 billion, compared with just $8.6
billion a decade ago.
   Employers must now pay $434 in combined state and federal taxes
a year on the first $7,000 of each covered worker's wages. About
$56 goes to the federal government and the states get the rest.
   Thirty-six states have adopted bases above the $7,000 level _
ranging from $7,100 in Connecticut to $20,900 in Alaska _ subject
to state taxes. The federal base was last raised in 1983, when it
was $6,000.
   Subcommittee Chairman Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., and other tax
writers want to raise the base to $10,000 over the next three years
to avert a repeat of the eligibility cutbacks by many states at the
depth of the last recession.
   By 1983, the system had run up a $21 billion debt. It was paid
off last year with the exception of Michigan, which still owed $800
million as of last June, after the Reagan administration began
charging states interest on their borrowings.
   Although the state and federal Unemployment Trust Funds now have
combined reserves of $45 billion, the General Accounting Office
said that would last only 11 months in a recession similar to the
16-month downturn in 1981-82.
   The reserves ``still appear to be inadequate to handle a severe
recession,'' Assistant Comptroller General Lawrence Thompson told
the subcommittee.
   Using a model developed by the Labor Department, congressional
auditors projected 13 state funds becoming insolvent to the tune of
$8.9 billion if a similar recession begins next year.
   The governors expressed anger at having to close unemployment
offices and spend more to run the program because of a $124 million
shortfall in fiscal year 1990 from budget cuts and more claims as a
result of greater joblessness than they had anticipated.
   But they said through a representative at the hearing, Ohio
Employment Services Administrator Ellen O'Brien, states should get
a larger share of the existing taxes rather than have to raise
taxes.
   ``Employers who finance this system through the Federal
Unemployment Tax Act are investing enough money to provide adequate
service,'' she said. ``No new taxes are necessary to return the
program to its proper funding level.''

   The Senate appears set to confirm conservative
civil rights official Clarence Thomas as a federal appeals judge,
but his progress still is being plagued by doubts about his record
in the Reagan administration.
   ``Mr. Thomas has the ability to serve with distinction on the
Court of Appeals,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said Thursday
as the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 12-1 in favor of the
nomination.
   Opponents said it seemed certain that the full Senate would
confirm Thomas, who as head of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission over the last eight years was one of the Reagan
administration's most visible blacks.
   The solitary vote against Thomas on the committee came from Sen.
Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, who said the nominee's remarks at his
confirmation hearing two weeks ago left him ``flabbergasted.''
   But efforts by civil rights forces to block Thomas lost momentum
when Benjamin Hooks, head of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, announced that he would not stand in
the nominee's way.
   The chief complaint has been that thousands of age
discrimination cases expired without government action in recent
years.
   Thomas said that state fair employment commissions were to blame.
   He came in for renewed criticism late Thursday, however, as Sen.
David Pryor, D-Ark., inserted a statement in the Congressional
Record, complaining that several thousand age discrimination
claimants ``during Chairman Thomas' watch lost their rights largely
due to EEOC neglect and mismanagement.''
   Pryor echoed civil rights groups in saying that Thomas fell
short in estimating at his confirmation hearing that the number of
lapsed cases was around 900.
   Pryor, chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, said many answers
that Thomas gave at the hearing ``appeared to be shaky attempts at
revisionist history.'' Pryor said he had not yet decided how to
vote on confirmation.
   Congressional liberals did not hide their concern over
speculation that within a few years Thomas could be ripe for
advancement to the Supreme Court. ``I have some concerns about this
man in terms of whether I could support him for the Supreme
Court,'' said Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis.
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., said
standards for a Supreme Court justice are different from those for
the appeals bench.
   The Senate is considering Thomas for the vacancy left by the
resignation of Robert Bork from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia. Bork resigned after the Senate rejected him
for the Supreme Court in the most embittered confirmation fight in
decades.
   Thomas, who climbed from an impoverished childhood in rural
Georgia to graduation from Yale Law School, is an outspoken critic
of racial hiring quotas and affirmative action programs. Civil
rights forces have long been cool to him because of these views.
   The Alliance for Justice, a liberal court-watcher group that was
among the severest critics of the nomination, issued a statement
Thursday saying it was ``clear that senators hold grave doubts
about the nominee's qualifications.''
   The organization said his performance on the bench ``will be
watched carefully to determine whether he is truly committed to the
rule of law.''
   Metzenbaum, a leading congressional liberal, told the committee
he had initially expected to vote to confirm Thomas but changed his
mind at the confirmation hearing when Thomas blamed state fair
employment agencies for problems involving numerous age
discrimination cases. In these cases, the statute of limitations
for action expired before the complaints were processed.
   ``I was flabbergasted that he did not know that the state
agencies are under contract to process state age discrimination
claims,'' Metzenbaum said. He said the federal commission is
responsible for enforcing the contract and regulating the actions
of the state agencies.

<HEAD>BMW Recalls 62,000 Cars to Repair Seat Belts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is recalling 62,000 BMW
automobiles because of flaws in some seat belts that might endanger
riders who mistakenly think the belts are fastened.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in its
monthly report of automobile defect investigations, also announced
Thursday nearly 600,000 child safety seats were being recalled
because the handles sometimes loosen when the seats are carried by
hand.
   The BMW problem has been detected in 525i, 535i, 735iL and 750iL
cars from the 1989 and 1990 model years, the agency said in its
monthly report of automobile defect investigations.
   The center arm rest sometimes comes in contact with the front
seat belt buckle and prevents it from latching, said Tom McGurn,
spokesman for BMW of North America Inc.
   ``It gives the driver or passenger the impression that the belt
is secured when in fact it's not, and in the event of a crash it
wouldn't be secure,'' he said.
   The company will begin notifying owners March 2, he said.
   Also being recalled are 595,127 Century brand child restraint
and carrying seats, model 580, agency spokesman Tim Hurd said. The
seats work fine as a restraining device in automobiles, but the
handle sometimes works loose when the seat is removed from the
vehicle and carried.
   ``The child can fall out of the seat when that happens,'' he
said.
   The government has received 85 reports of loose handles and one
injury resulting from the problem, Hurd said.
   Also reported was a recall of 213 Chevrolet Corvettes with LT5
engines from the 1990 model year. A company engineer discovered
cracked fuel line ends that could cause leaks and engine fires,
although no fires have been reported, company spokesman Dave
Hudgens said.
   The agency also reported the following new investigations, which
could lead to recalls:
   _A probe of three complaints of breaking cables designed to hold
spare tires in place underneath Dodge Caravans and Plymouth
Voyagers. Affected are up to 1.2 million vehicles from the 1984
through 1988 model years.
   _Frame cracks or breaks in Dodge Ram trucks. There have been
three complaints, one of which blamed the problem for severing
brake lines and causing an accident.
   _Rear suspension tie rod socket failures in 1984 through 1988
Chevrolet Corvettes. There have been three complaints, two
accidents and one injury. About 180,000 of the cars are on the road.
   _Anti-lock brake failure in the 1989 Jeep Cherokee, the subject
of three complaints, one alleging an accident and injury.
   _A missing steering shaft bolt in the 1990 Mitsubishi Montero,
blamed for one accident with an injury.
   _Engine fires in 1985 through 1990 model school buses with Ford
Motor Co. medium-duty truck chassis. Rubber hoses that connect
emission control components are believed to be catching fire.
   _Floorboard cracks in the Ford Bronco, 1989 and 1990 models.
There have been two complaints of cracks where the driver's seat is
attached to the floorboard.
   _Power brake loss in Ford E250 and E350 vans. The problem is
limited to about 7,500 vehicles with a particular type of
alternator.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Seeks to Revise Disability Proposal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's proposal to modify a
proposed civil rights bill for disabled Americans would deny them
the protection given blacks, other minorities and women, critics
say.
   ``We are incredulous that the administration would be willing to
treat persons with disabilities differently from other victims of
intentional discrimination,'' civil rights advocate Ralph G. Neas
said Thursday after hearing of the administration's proposal to
alter the Americans With Disabilities Act.
   ``The premise of this law is parity with other civil rights
law,'' said Arlene B. Mayerson, a law professor and directing
attorney of the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, a
group that has worked on the bill.
   In testimony Thursday before a House committee, the acting U.S.
attorney general for civil rights reiterated the administration's
support of the proposed law. But James P. Turner said its provision
governing remedies for job discrimination should be rewritten.
   ``A new impediment to the quick passage of the ADA has arisen
and the administration seeks to resolve affirmatively this
difficulty,'' Turner told the House Small Business Committee. ``I
speak, of course, of the remedies provisions of the recently
introduced Civil Rights Act of 1990.''
   Turner said the administration opposes that proposal, which
seeks to strengthen the landmark 1964 civil rights law which
forbids discrimination because of race or creed. The new proposal
would allow lawsuits for compensatory and punitive damages in cases
of intentional job discrimination.
   Turner said that to avoid delays in passing the disabilities
law, its reliance on that section of the civil rights act should be
deleted. Instead, the disabilities bill should outline specific
remedies for violations, including court injunctions, reinstatement
and back pay, he said.
   The proposed law would guarantee the rights of disabled people
to employment, goods and services. The Senate version,
overwhelmingly passed in September, was a compromise with the White
House.
   Turner suggested the new civil rights bill could upset that
compromise.
   ``Inclusion of such extraordinary relief as punitive damages is
simply unwarranted in a statutory scheme as new, bold, and complex
as the provision of disabilities rights concepts to the American
business community,'' Turner said.
   Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil
Rights, countered: ``We cannot understand why the Bush
administration would oppose monetary damages for victims of
intentional discrimination.''
   The conference is an umbrella group for 185 civil rights
organizations and is actively supporting both bills.
   Neas said he believed the House will pass the disabilities act
in the spring and will pass the civil rights act in the summer.

<HEAD>Indictment Says Clines Didn't Report Contra Arms Income</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former CIA agent who worked in Oliver
North's arms supply network to the Contras is accused in an
indictment of failing to report some of his income from the
operation.
   Thomas G. Clines, a business partner of Iran-Contra figures
Richard Secord and Albert Hakim, was accused Thursday of
under-reporting his earnings to the Internal Revenue Service and of
falsely stating that he had no foreign financial accounts.
   Clines reported receipts of $265,000 for tax year 1985 and
$402,513 for 1986, according to the federal grand jury indictment
returned in Baltimore, Md.
   During the period in question, Hakim set aside more than
$972,000 in commissions for Clines in an offshore entity code-named
C. Tea, according to a congressional report on the Iran-Contra
affair issued in 1987.
   Two counts of the indictment accuse him of under-reporting his
gross receipts. Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years
imprisonment and $100,000 in fines on conviction.
   The other two counts accuse Clines of failing to report his
foreign accounts, with maximum penalties on conviction for each
charge of 10 years in prison and $500,000 in fines.
   Clines and his lawyer regard the decision to bring the case as
an ``ill-advised'' step taken by ``overzealous prosecutors,'' said
his attorney, Paula Junghans. Clines intends to defend himself ``to
the fullest,'' she added.
   Sources familiar with the matter say Clines filed an amended tax
return for 1985 in the fall of 1987, nearly a year after the
Iran-Contra affair came into public view, reporting additional
expenses and additional income.
   Clines takes the position that he has reported all his income
from the Contra transactions, say sources familiar with Clines'
situation.
   Clines collected the money in connection with his work for ``the
Enterprise,'' the complex of foreign corporations and Swiss
accounts which Hakim and Secord used to move money in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Hakim is a key witness in the investigation of Clines, according
to sources familiar with the investigation. Hakim was placed on two
years' probation and fined $5,000 on Feb. 1 for his role in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   At the request of his friend Secord, Clines helped procure arms
for the Contra rebels starting in 1985. In addition to locating a
European arms dealer as a source of weapons, Clines helped arrange
for shipping and lined up crews to transport the supplies to the
rebels.
   Clines worked for the CIA for 30 years. He was an agent in
Southeast Asia, was involved in the Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba
and became director of training in the directorate of operations,
also known as the clandestine services.
   He also was a close associate of Edwin Wilson, the former CIA
agent who is serving 52 years in federal prison for illegally
selling guns and explosives to Libya.
   Clines pleaded guilty in 1984 on behalf of his wholly owned
company to inflating bills submitted to the Defense Department for
shipping U.S. military equipment to Egypt. He was fined the maximum
$10,000 and paid the government $100,000 on behalf of his firm,
Systems Services International.

<HEAD>Ethics Committee Votes for Trial-Like Hearing for Durenberger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Ethics Committee plans to begin
trial-like hearings on ``substantial credible evidence'' that Sen.
Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., broke Senate rules and federal law.
   Most of the allegations stem from a book promotion arrangement
that the Minnesota Republican used to raise $100,000 in possible
violation of Senate honoraria limits.
   Durenberger called on the committee to reach a conclusion ``with
all possible speed'' and said, ``It was never my intent to
circumvent Senate rules for my own benefit.'' An aide characterized
most of the alleged violations as bookkeeping mistakes.
   Committee Chairman Howell Heflin, D-Ala. said the vote Thursday
to proceed from the committee's grand jury phase to the trial stage
was unanimous.
   During the trial stage, the committee will decide whether to
recommend disciplinary action to the full Senate. The possible
punishments ranges from a reprimand to expulsion.
   The six-member committee said Durenberger may have:
   _Violated outside income limits by being paid for speeches in
1985 and 1986. Durenberger made numerous appearances which he
characterized as book promotion speeches for his publisher, Piranha
Press Inc. of Minneapolis.
   _Failed to report on his financial disclosure forms for 1985 and
1986 reimbursement for trips he made in connection with the book
publishing deal.
   _Violated a rule by converting a campaign contribution to
personal use, and violated federal election law by failing to
report and deposit the contribution, which he transferred to his
publisher. The check of $5,000 was made out to ``Durenberger for
U.S. Senate.''
   _Violated federal law and a Senate Rules Committee regulation
prohibiting the commercial use of Senate space. The committee said
he was paid an honorarium or other fee for six appearances in
Senate-controlled areas.
   _Failed to disclose that he accepted limousine service in the
Boston area during 1985 and 1986, in connection with personal
travel to Concord, Mass., where he visited a marriage counselor.
   The committee said it was continuing its investigation into
Senate reimbursement that Durenberger received for stays in a
Minneapolis condominium he partly owned.
   The committee's hearings, which could be open to the public,
probably will not start before mid-March, said New Hampshire Sen.
Warren Rudman, the panel's ranking Republican.
   The panel has not investigated recently published reports that
Durenberger received preferential treatment on $1.3 million in
unsecured loans from a St. Paul bank, Rudman said.
   ``Nothing's closed,'' Rudman said at a news conference.
   The committee said it failed to find ``substantial credible
evidence'' that Durenberger violated rules in obtaining speaking
engagements in Boston. He combined the trips with visits to the
marriage counselor.
   The committee said there was an ``absence of evidence'' that
Durenberger used Senate staff in connection with his book deal.
   Durenberger appeared before the committee Feb. 8 at his request
and later told reporters: ``The cloud of questions that has been
hanging over my head ... has finally started to clear.''
   He said in a statement Thursday, ``I made every effort to seek
opinion from the appropriate bodies and from legal counsel. And I
believed that I had fully disclosed all income received under my
financial arrangements.''
   Durenberger spokeswoman Carrie Collins said the ethics committee
had ``narrowed the focus'' of its investigation. She characterized
all the allegations except the possible outside income rule
breaking as ``alleged bookkeeping violations.''
   The senator's travel reimbursements for his book promotion
appearances were added to his disclosure statements last July, only
after the Ethics Committee began its investigation. The committee
was concerned that ``he didn't disclose them in a timely manner,''
Ms. Collins said.
   She said the $5,000 check to Durenberger's campaign committee
was supposed to be made out to the publisher. ``That was a
mistake,'' Ms. Collins said.
   Groups that sponsored Durenberger appearances in the Boston area
provided the limousine service to the Concord, Mass., office of the
senator's marriage counselor, the spokeswoman said. ``He regarded
it as a convenience and not a gift.''

<HEAD>Defense Secretary Sees 12,000 American Troops Leaving Pacific</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney confirmed for the
first time today that the Pentagon wants to cut in its forces in
Asia by withdrawing about 12,000 military personnel over the next
three years.
   Cheney wrapped up his two-week visit in the Pacific Rim with a
major policy address before the National Press Club, stressing the
proposed reductions are ``moderate'' and should not be seen as a
``first step towards withdrawal'' from the Pacific.
   Cheney is scheduled to return Saturday to the United States.
   ``The United States intends to remain involved in Asia,'' said
Cheney, attempting to reassure governments in the region that have
relied on U.S. forces to maintain peace and stability.
   The defense chief spoke with the governments in Japan, South
Korea and the Philippines about proposals for troop reductions and
sought increased support for the 120,000 American forces based in
Asia, spurred by a Congress that is eager to trim defense spending.
The new message has been stark _ there will be fewer troops and
less money to pay for them.
   Amid the lessening of superpower tensions in Europe, Cheney has
been pressed by Congress to slash his defense budget and reassess
the reasons for keeping U.S. troops in the region.
   In a question-and-answer session, Cheney declined to cite a
specific figure for the proposed withdrawal, but said he'd been
discussing ``a range'' of cuts with the host governments.
   Cheney spoke about such cuts during his trip, but he never spoke
openly of any figure.
   ``It is on the order of 10 percent, scattered about the
region,'' Cheney explained. ``The first phase (for the withdrawal)
is approximately three years.''
   The secretary said there will be more talks with military
commanders and Congress before final decisions are made. But he
said he believed Congress would resist pressure from some lawmakers
for 20 percent to 30 percent cuts and maintain ``a major U.S.
presence in the Pacific.''
   Increased support for U.S. troops has been the other key topic
of discussions with Asian leaders.
   Asked how much more he had requested from Japanese officials,
Cheney said, ``We'd like as much support as we can get.'' The
secretary said Japan has ``significantly increased'' its funding
for American forces in Japan recently, adding, ``We think that is a
very positive trend.''
   Cheney met Thursday with Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu,
Defense Minister Juro Matsumoto and Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama.
   In the daylong meetings, Cheney sought increases in the $2.4
billion annual support toward the $7 billion cost of the American
deployment in Japan.
   Japanese officials, following daylong discussions Thursday with
Cheney, called plans for reducing the 50,000 U.S. troops in Japan
``prudent and appropriate.''
   And Cheney hinted in his speech there might even be more changes
in store.
   ``We are thinking about some force adjustments,'' Cheney said in
his speech, emphasizing they would be ``moderate ... adjustments''
that would not harm the security balance in the region.
   ``We are not talking about a first step toward withdrawal,''
Cheney said. ``In the future, if there are solid indications that
regional stability will not be threatened, we may _ in consultation
with our allies _ make other adjustments that would be
appropriate.''
   To emphasize America's commitment to the region, the secretary
announced the aircraft carrier USS Midway, now based in Yokosuka,
Japan and due to be retired, will be replaced by the carrier USS
Independence in the summer of 1991.
   The Midway was commissioned in 1945. The Independence,
commissioned in 1960, will leave its current home port in San
Diego, Calif.
   Cheney, in a message for Washington lawmakers, also said ``it
would be a mistake'' to reduce the U.S. presence in Asia just
because of the lessening of tensions in Europe.
   America must ``look at the region on its own terms,'' Cheney
said.
   The Soviet Union hasn't acted to reduce tensions in Asia as it
has in Europe, Cheney said, and he called on Moscow to help calm
the region's flashpoints.
   ``I would welcome Soviet acts that would contribute genuinely to
a reduction of tensions in the Asia-Pacific region,'' Cheney said.

<HEAD>Eight Friends Subpoenaed, Sources Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight close friends of Mayor Marion Barry are
under subpoena in an expanding investigation into Barry's alleged
drug use, law enforcement and city government sources say.
   The eight men, described by one top city official as ``late
night traveling companions'' of Barry's, were subpoenaed Thursday,
the sources said.
   The action came as Barry, according to his press aide, left a
Florida rehabilitation center to start a second phase of his
treatment for alcoholism.
   Barry, who had been a patient at the Hanley-Hazelden Center in
West Palm Beach, Fla., since Jan. 21, was moved to the Fenwick Hall
treatment center off the coast of South Carolina, according to a
statement issued by his spokeswoman, Lurma Rackley.
   A law enforcement source said the eight men would be asked
whether they have ever used drugs with the mayor, who was indicted
last week on cocaine possession and perjury charges.
   Barry has repeatedly denied ever using drugs.
   In addition, subpoenas were served on the city government for
records of any city contracts issued to any of those individuals,
the source said.
   Prosecutors want to know whether the mayor ever offered city
contracts in exchange for drugs or whether he improperly steered
contracts to his friends, the source said.
   Barry is scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court on Wednesday
to enter pleas to the eight-count felony perjury and misdemeanor
cocaine possession indictment returned against him last Thursday.
The indictment stemmed from an arrest that followed a sting
operation in which FBI agents reportedly videotaped the mayor
smoking cocaine.
   Barry's attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy, has said the mayor will
plead innocent to all eight charges.
   Rackley said the mayor chose Fenwick Hall after he and his wife
Effi consulted with specialists and others familiar with the
numerous treatment facilities in the country.
   The South Carolina center was chosen because it provided what
was called ``an adult chemical dependency inpatient family
treatment program,'' according to Rackley's statement.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's proposal to slow the growth
of Medicare by $5.5 billion next year would hit hospitals too hard
and should be rejected, according to letters signed by a majority
of the House and Senate.
   Signed by members of both parties and sent to the House and
Senate budget committees, the two letters complained that hospitals
are already under financial pressures.
   One letter was signed by 51 of the 100 senators, another by 227
of the 435 House members.
   Medicare is one of the fastest-growing federal programs. It is
expected to cost $104 billion this year _ about one-twelfth of the
entire federal budget _ and grow to $183 billion by 1995.
   Last year, Bush proposed restraining Medicare spending by $5
billion. Congress eventually approved $2.8 billion in savings.
   Of the $37 billion in deficit cuts the president proposed in the
1991 budget he released last month, the largest piece was the $5.5
billion in reduced Medicare spending.

   Vice President Dan Quayle will travel to South
America for presidential inaugurations in Chile and Brazil next
month and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy will join the delegation to Chile.
   Quayle also is expected during his March 9-16 trip to stop in
Argentina, Paraguay and Barbados to continue U.S. efforts to
overcome Latin resentment lingering from the U.S. invasion of
Panama in December. Many Latin countries still have not given
formal diplomatic recognition to the U.S.-installed government of
President Guillermo Endara.
   Quayle and Kennedy, D-Mass., will attend the inauguration of
Patricio Aylwin on March 11 in Chile.
   Brazil holds its inauguration March 15, installing Fernando
Collar de Mello. Elected Dec. 20, Collor de Mello recently made a
pre-inaugural trip to Washington, where he met with both Quayle and
President Bush.
   Kennedy, who has long been interested in Chilean affairs, will
go only on that part of the trip.
   Chile's Dec. 14 elections marked a return of democracy to the
last South American nation still ruled by the military.

<HEAD>Panel Approves Black Revolutionary Statue For Mall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A foundation honoring Black History Month has
won initial approval for the design of a memorial to black
Americans who participated in the American Revolution.
   The memorial, which would be the first on the Washington Mall
dedicated to blacks, honors some 5,000 soldiers and freedom-seekers
who have received relatively little recognition from historians.
   ``It was the beginning of the struggle for freedom in America,''
said Maurice Barboza, a Plainville, Conn., native and president of
The Patriots Foundation, the group promoting the memorial proposal.
``The Declaration of Independence galvanized the struggle for
freedom in America.''
   The National Capital Memorial Commission on Thursday unanimously
approved the design for the memorial, which is to be located on the
Mall near the reflecting pool, midway between the Lincoln Memorial
and the Washington Monument and not far from the Vietnam War
Memorial.

   The leading presidential candidates,
top election observers and the Roman Catholic church endorsed
efforts to reduce the possibility of violence in Sunday's elections.
   ``All parties and alliances should let Feb. 25's voting take
place without demonstrations or victory celebrations that could
provoke violence,'' said opposition presidential candidate Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro.
   Mrs. Chamorro's United National Opposition and President Daniel
Ortega's Sandinista party have accused each other of planning
violence, but their rhetoric has toned down as election day
approaches.
   Ortega said he believes Mrs. Chamorro is sincere in her wish to
avoid violence, but said he was not so certain of others in her
14-party coalition.
   ``We need to create a climate of reconciliation and speak a
language of peace,'' said Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo,
Nicaragua's Roman Catholic prelate. ``If Nicaragua does not put an
end to violence, violence will put an end to Nicaragua.''
   Joao Baena Soares, the secretary-general of the Organization of
American States, addressed a special appeal to ``those involved in
military activities,'' which would include the Sandinista army and
the U.S.-backed Contra guerrillas.
   Baena Soares and other observers said conditions for a fair vote
Sunday exist, although Secretary of State James Baker said in
Washington that the United States would have to make up its own
mind about that.
   Baker ruled out normal ties with a Sandinista Nicaragua unless
it maintains the democratic opening to the opposition and refrains
for a ``sustained period'' from supporting leftist rebels in El
Salvador.
   Ortega has struck conciliatory notes toward both the opposition
and the United States as he sniffs victory, especially after a
massive Wednesday night rally by 300,000 people, one-tenth of the
nation's population.
   ``After the election I will propose a political truce so that we
can concentrate all our forces and resources on lifting the
economy,'' Ortega said at a news conference.
   When asked about Baker's comments, Ortega said: ``I expect Mr.
Baker will be disposed to discuss the fundamental problems between
us. We have to do away with political rhetoric and work for peace.''
   Nicaragua's 1.75 million voters will elect a president, vice
president, a 90-member assembly, 144 town and city councils and two
regional councils on Sunday.
   The main face-off is between Mrs. Chamorro and Ortega, who is
seeking re-election to a six-year term.
   Eight other candidates are running for president, but only Erick
Ramirez's Social Christians are considered significant. Ramirez's
party expects the 14-party UNO coalition to founder whether it wins
or loses and hopes to end up as the second largest single party in
Nicaragua.
   With campaigning legally halted as of Wednesday night,
candidates and official observers made a round of appearances for
the benefit of the international media.
   Former U.S. Attorney General Elliot Richardson, representing the
United Nations, made a trip to the northern countryside and said
the elections ``are a step towards reconciliation and unity for all
Nicaraguans, who need peace.''
   Other observers were already spreading out across the country in
anticipation of Sunday's voting. Violence was considered most
likely to occur in small towns and rural areas where local feuds
combine with politics in a volatile brew.
   Ortega drew the largest crowd, more than 300 reporters and at
least another 100 photographers and television crew members.
   Actor Ed Asner, singer Jackson Browne and Bianca Jagger, ex-wife
of rock star Mick Jagger, were among the celebrities at various
functions, drawing considerable attention from press and
politicians.

<HEAD>Polar Bears Digging Dens In Refuge Targeted for Oil, Gas
Exploration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Biologists say polar bears seem to be
making their dens more often on the coastal plain of the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge, where oil companies want to start
exploration drilling.
   Caribou have been the primary wildlife concern in the debate
thus far, with environmentalists arguing that the coastal plain is
a key calving area.
   The discovery of the bears' use of the land gives opponents to
drilling more ammunition in the debate, environmentalists said.
   The Interior Department has recommended opening the refuge to
drilling. It has called the area the most promising, unexplored
prospect for a major oil find in the country.
   Congressional action on the refuge has been stymied since the
Exxon Valdez ran aground March 24 in Prince William Sound, spilling
nearly 11 million gallons of oil.
   But the push to open the refuge is expected to resume as early
as late this year, and the Bush administration is counting on $2.6
billion in oil revenues from the refuge by 1993.
   The continuing research shows that the 1.5-million-acre coastal
plain is the most suitable terrain in the region for pregnant polar
bears to make their dens.
   Because bears that den on land are much more likely to produce
surviving cubs, the research suggests that disturbance of denning
patterns in the refuge could result in population declines for the
species.
   ``This is more evidence of the tremendous biological values that
would be compromised by oil development on the coastal plain,''
said Allen Smith, Alaska director of The Wilderness Society. ``We
are on the threshold of seeing impacts that go well beyond what the
oil industry is saying.''
   Mark Fraker, senior environmental scientist for British
Petroleum, said the research does point to the importance of the
refuge for polar bears. But Fraker said good planning should
protect them from harm.
   ``By knowing about areas used for denning, it should be possible
to place facilities where they avoid dens,'' Fraker said.
   The polar bear research was conducted by Steven Amstrup, polar
bear project leader for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, who
stressed that his findings are tentative.
   Amstrup was the first wildlife biologist to successfully outfit
polar bears with radio collars for satellite tracking. His research
findings are a result of that trackin.
   He said most pregnant bears choose to den on pack ice, where
harsher weather conditions and ice break-ups lessen the chances of
cub survival.
   ``The greatest concentration of recent land dens has been on''
the wildlife refuge, he said. ``If oil and gas development in ANWR
and around barrier islands of Alaska's north coast caused polar
bears to avoid current land denning areas, annual production of
cubs would be compromised.''
   Previous research has identified about 2,000 Beaufort Sea polar
bears. Of that number, about 450 are sexually active females.
   Females get pregnant about every three years, meaning that in
any given year about 150 females will dig dens. As many as 15
percent of those will show up on the refuge, Amstrup said.
   Amstrup's research also raises questions about whether
disturbing the polar bears would be acceptable under an
international treaty that the United States signed in 1976.
   The International Agreement for the Conservation of Polar Bears
binds the country to protecting females and their young and polar
bear ecosystems.
   Fraker said that treaty is a consideration. ``But it doesn't
mean you can't do anything,'' he said.

<HEAD>Thefts Of Torahs in Metropolitan Philadelpia Investigated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Torah that survived the Holocaust was
among six sacred scrolls stolen this month from synagogues in New
Jersey and Pennsylvania and authorities said they suspect a ring
that targets religious artificats.
   John H. Kundts, a FBI spokesman, said Thursday that
investigators believe the thefts this month may be related. All
occurred in or around Philadelphia.
   Investigators also are looking into a possible connection
between the stolen Torahs and silver pieces with Hebrew writing
that turned up at a pawn shop in Runnemede, N.J.
   It wasn't known if the silver pieces had been removed from any
of the synagogues in question.
   Police and religious leaders said they doubt the thefts are the
result of anti-Semitism or vandalism.
   ``There is no indication of defamation or desecration. They're
not painting swastikas or damaging property,'' Kundts said. ``This
is a specific criminal act to steal a specific religious object.''
   The Torah is a sacred scroll, handwritten on parchment, that
contains many of the basic teachings of Judaism. A Torah inside its
special holder can fetch up to $35,000, religious leaders said.
   Two Torahs were taken Feb. 10 from Congregation M'kor Shalom in
Mount Laurel, N.J. said Rabbi Fred Neulander. One of the scrolls
was known as the Milevsko Torah and was recovered after World War
II in Prague, Czechoslovakia.
   ``The congregation feels violated _ individually and
collectively,'' Neulander said. ``Their reactions are very similar
to reactions of death.''
   Neulander said it would cost between $15,000 and $40,000 each to
replace the Torahs. He said he was doubtful they would be recovered
because the only means of distinction is the handwriting.
   ``These are the most sacred possessions we have,'' Neulander
said. ``To lose one is devastating.''
   Several Jewish institutions, including a school, community
center and a synagogue were burglarized in Cherry Hill. N.J.,
between Feb. 1 and Feb. 3, said Police Sgt. Richard Tomlinson. A
Torah was taken from the synagogue.
   Last Saturday, two Torahs were discovered missing from a
synagogue in northeast Philadelphia, and another Torah was reported
missing Feb. 5 in the suburb of Cheltenham.
   There was no sign of a break-in in either case, said
Philadelphia Police Capt. Jim Nocco.
   ``Obviously, it was someone who had free access to come and go
without suspicion,'' Nocco said.

<HEAD>Last Stalin Statue Falls, Exhibit Opens on His Era</HEAD>

   Mongolians renounced the legacy of
dictator Josef Stalin, toppling his last statue in the capital and
opening an exhibit displaying a torture chamber model and other
horrors of the purges he inspired.
   Cheers broke out Thursday when the 51-foot granite statue was
lifted from its pedestal onto a truck and carted away. Some people
applauded its removal; some even kicked it.
   ``The whole people wanted this,'' said Hortsbar, 36, an
electrician who passed the statue every day on his way to work.
   It had stood in front of the national library in the city center
since 1951. Workers said they did not know where the statue was
taken or what would happen to it.
   Last month, the ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party
bowed to public pressure and removed a smaller statue of Stalin
from in front of an army club.
   It was one of its few concessions to a new, vocal opposition
movement that has staged repeated rallies for democratic reform.
The movement organized itself this week as the Mongolian Democratic
Party.
   The larger statue's removal under cover of darkness may have
been to avoid confrontations in this nation where officials say
more than 38,000 people were purged or killed during a
Stalin-inspired era of terror in the 1930s and 1940s.
   At the Revolutionary Museum, just across the city's central
square from the library, the nation's first exhibit about that era
opened Wednesday. It was organized jointly by the museum and the
Ministry of State Security.
   Titled ``History Will Not Forget Them,'' the exhibit contains
pictures of purge victims and documents from the once-secret
ministry archives. Its aim is to ``tell the truth of history,''
museum officials said Thursday.
   Stalin came under criticism in the Soviet Union more than 30
years ago, but until 1984 Mongolia remained in the grip of Stalin
protege Yumjaagiyn Tsedenbal, who now lives in Moscow.
   The purges began under Tsedenbal's predecessor, Horloogiyn
Choybalsan, when a northern minority group on the Soviet-Mongolian
border was accused of spying for the Japanese.
   One chart in the exhibit said 19,895 people were executed from
1937 to 1939 alone. Most were ordinary workers and herdsmen, but
Buddhist monks, called lamas, were key targets and even some
high-ranking officials were accused of being enemies of the
revolution.
   The exhibit included a mock torture room, with a 4-foot-high
stool that prisoners were forced to sit on. The room was said to be
soundproof.
   The exhibit dedicated one section to attacks on religion,
showing scorched and scarred Buddhist scriptures. It said all of
Mongolia's 761 monasteries were destroyed during the purges. Only
three or four have been reopened.
   Although they had no figures, museum officials said attendance
was high. At noon Thursday, about 75 people were slowly moving
through the small room, studying each display.
   ``It's the wish of the people to get the truth about what really
happened during Stalin's time,'' said Oilzibaatar, a historian at
the State Security Ministry who was a consultant for the exhibit.
   Outside, in temperatures of about 4 degrees below zero
Fahrenheit, small crowds watched as workers with hammers and drills
dismantled Stalin's pedestal.
   ``From childhood, I believed that (Stalin) was a good man who
did many great things,'' said Lchawgsuren, a 45-year-old member of
the ruling party. ``Because of the new policy of restructuring, it
enabled us to see also the shadows of this man and his policies.''

<TEXT>
   Since taking over the commercial end of the Ariane
space program 10 years ago, Arianespace has rejected starry visions
like the 1960s moon race for the down-to-earth goal of making money.
   The 31 successful Ariane launches _ five rockets have exploded
including Thursday's 44-L launcher _ have brought the company more
than $2.5 billion in contracts to put 43 satellites in orbit.
   Thirty-two more satellites are on the schedule for future
launches, worth $2.36 billion.
   The program got off to a rough start Dec. 24, 1979, when the
European Space Agency's first Ariane rocket exploded after liftoff
at the launch site in French Guiana.
   But luck changed after Arianespace took over commercialization
of the program from the European Space Agency in 1980, just as
private satellites became a vital link in communications.
   Despite three rocket explosions through 1986, Arianespace
successfully focused on turning itself into a cheaper alternative
than its main competitor, the U.S. space shuttle.
   The Challenger disaster in 1986 left Ariane with an enviable
monopoly on the satellite launch business, exploiting America's
failure to develop unmanned launchers during the shuttle years.
   Though the shuttle returned to the skies in 1988, Ariane retains
a commanding grip on commercial launch services, holding more than
50 percent of all satellites in the lucrative market.
   Flexibility is part of the success. The series 4 rocket can be
configured eight different ways to boost varying payloads into
orbit in a more cost-effective mode than the manned shuttle.
   The larger series 5, due to hit the launch pad in the mid-1990s,
will enable Arianespace to put up larger and bigger satellites. The
rockets are built by 100 companies in 11 countries.
   The European Space Agency, which started the Ariane program in
1973, still maintains dreams of a building a Soviet-style European
space station and an American-style Hermes space shuttle.
   Prohibitive costs have kept such projects on the ground while
the Ariane rockets have grown into unglamourous but profitable
stars.
   Whether that remains so may depend on how fast Arianespace can
identify and correct what caused Thursday's explosion.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa has
told the sister of one of the American hostages in Lebanon that he
will visit Iran soon to push for a hostage release.
   In a meeting late Thursday, Sharaa said Syria has already told
Iran's leaders ``that it is their interest to work with us in
gaining the release of the hostages.''
   He told Peggy Say, sister of hostage Terry Anderson, that he
would ``work intensely with the top Iranian leaders'' on the
hostage issue.
   ``I hope we will be able to arrive at good results,'' he said.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest held of the 18 Western hostages in Lebanon.
He was abducted March 16, 1985.
   Mrs. Say, of Cadiz, Ky., and an Associated Press delegation was
in Damascus as part of trip to discuss with world leaders her
campaign to free her brother.
   The meeting came the same day as an editorial in the English
language Tehran Times in Iran said the hostages in Lebanon should
be released without conditions. The paper is close to Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   The hostages' fate is believed linked to a power struggle within
the Iranian government. The Times is close to President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, who has offered to help free the hostages before but
has been criticized for such moves by hard-line government factions.
   Sharaa called the editorial ``a good sign'' and Mrs. Say added
she found the newspaper's viewpoint ``encouraging.''
   Syria has good ties with Iran. It was the only major Arab
country to back Iran in its eight-year war with Iraq, which is
ruled by a rival wing of the Arab Baath Socialist party.
   Sharaa told her that a hostage release will be difficult until
the clashes between various Lebanese factions ends.
   Syria is the major power broker in Lebanon. It has 40,000 troops
in the country under a 1976 Arab League provision to end the
Christian-Moslem civil war.
   Sharaa said the hostage-takers ``must be isolated. Then they
would rush to give up the hostages.'' He said the kidnappers feel
comfortable in the ``blackout'' of security in Lebanon.
   He said the United States was not using its influence
sufficiently to bring peace to Lebanon or to encourage Iran to
press the kidnapping groups to release their captives. He did not
give specifics of what action the United States should take.
   Mrs. Say thanked Sharaa for Syria's efforts and said hundreds of
thousands of Americans are ``praying for Syria and its role as a
mediator.''
   In its editorial, the Tehran Times said the struggle against
Western influence in the Middle East was legitimate and should
continue, but that all forces in Lebanon should work to free
hostages of whatever nationality.
   It said the release should be on Islamic and humanitarian
grounds, adding, ``Maybe 1990 will be the year for the release of
all the hostages.''

<HEAD>Study: Surgery to Correct Nearsightedness Helps Many, But

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A surgical procedure that corrects
nearsightedness gives an unacceptable variety of outcomes, although
two-thirds of people who undergo it eventually are able to see
without glasses, doctors say.
   The procedure, called radial keratotomy, changes the curve of
the cornea, which acts as a lens for the eye. Surgeons make tiny
incisions in the cornea resembling the pattern of spokes in a wheel
in a painless outpatient procedure.
   For four years, researchers tracked 390 patients who underwent
the surgery on one eye between March 1982 and October 1983. Visual
sharpness was improved to better than 20-40 in 76 percent of the
eyes, the researchers reported.
   Most patients _ 69 percent _ had visual sharpness of 20-200 or
worse before the operation, and no one had sharpness better than
20-40, the researchers reported in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   But eleven patients who had 20-20 vision or better with
corrective lenses before the surgery suffered a significant loss of
visual sharpness after the procedure, even with glasses or contact
lenses, they reported.
   However, ``everybody _ all except one _ became less nearsighted
(without corrective lenses), so the operation obviously works,''
said Dr. George O. Waring III, national director of the study.
   The one patient whose acuity did not improve stayed the same,
Waring said in a telephone interview Thursday.
   Infections developed in two patients, who were successfully
treated with antibiotics without losing visual acuity, said John
Carter, coordinator of the study, based at Emory University in
Atlanta.
   ``Our study and others have demonstrated fairly well that there
are some adverse outcomes, but they are relatively rare,'' said
Carter, also in a telephone interview.
   The surgery, costing about $2,000 per eye, was introduced in the
United States in 1976. It is most widely practiced in the Soviet
Union.
   Most patients also saw lines around lights at night because of
light bouncing off the scars in the cornea, but it didn't bother
them, said Waring. ``It was like dirty glasses or contact lenses,''
he said.
   One year after the surgery, 48 percent of the patients said they
were ``very satisfied'' with it, 42 percent were ``moderately
satisfied'' and 10 percent were dissatisfied, the researchers said.
   Among the 323 patients who had both eyes operated on, 64 percent
said they wore no visual correction four years after the surgery,
the researchers said.
   However, the unpredictability of the outcomes remains
``unacceptable,'' 14 years after the procedure was introduced,
despite improvements in surgery techniques, the researchers said.
   ``I think it's safe to say that the predictablity is better now
than it was, but there's still a range of outcomes,'' Carter said.
   Dr. Perry S. Binder of the University of California at San
Diego, cautioned that radial keratotomy ``is not intended for all
myopic patients just because they wish to see without spectacles or
contacts.''
   Surgeons who don't specialize in the procedure are leery of it
because the tissue being operated on is healthy, Binder said in an
editorial in Friday's Journal.
   An estimated 80 million people in the United States are
nearsighted.

<HEAD>Israeli Warplanes Attack Guerrilla Base Near Southern Lebanese
Port</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli warplanes blasted a Palestinian
guerrilla base before dawn near this southern port city in the
fourth Israeli attack on bases in Lebanon in eight days.
   Witnesses said the planes drew heavy fire from the guerrillas
while they fired rockets at the base and released balloons to
detract ground-to-air missiles.
   There was no immediate word on casualties.
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army said the jets returned to base
safely.
   It said the base was used by a terrorist organization to launch
attacks on Israel. It did not identify the group.
   A police spokesman said the raid targeted a base manned by
guerrillas of George Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine in hills east of Sidon.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named in line with regulations,
said at least three Israeli jet fighters carried out the
five-minute attack.
   The jets fired six air-to-surface missiles against the base, he
said.
   At dawn, around three hours after the air attack, smoke still
billowed from the stricken target, a two-story building used by
Palestinian guerrillas for about four years.
   Witnesses in Sidon, 20 miles from Beirut, said the jets roared
low over the city, shaking them out of bed.
   ``We rushed to basements and air raid shelters assuming the city
was under attack,'' Fatima Hableh said.
   Her husband, Hassan Hableh, said he watched the planes releasing
scarlet balloons to deflect heat-seeking anti-aircraft missiles.
   The raiding jets, Hableh said, also released parachute flares
that illuminated the area.
   Guerrilla defenders fired at the planes from anti-aircraft guns.
   ``I could see tracer anti-aircraft rounds in the sky, exploding
around the planes into small puffs of white smoke. But none of the
planes was hit,'' he said.
   Police said the attack came less than 10 hours after a raid that
targeted pro-Iranian Moslem guerrillas in the nearby village of
Libaa, wounding three fighters. Friday's attack was Israel's
seventh air raid this year.
   On Monday, Israeli jets bombed a base near Sidon belonging to
the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, another
Marxist PLO faction.
   On Feb. 16, Israeli aircraft attacked a position near Sidon used
by the mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal militia.
   Guerrillas have launched attacks this year in Israel's buffer
zone in southern Lebanon, established in an effort to prevent
incursions into Israel. The zone, six-to-10 miles deep, was set up
when Israel withdrew the bulk of its army from Lebanon in 1985,
three years after it invaded.

   Inflation is running at 70
percent. Rio's crime is so bad, pizza companies have suspended
deliveries because their drivers are getting mugged. The whole
country, in fact, seems headed for catastrophe.
   But many of Brazil's 150 million residents wouldn't dream of
letting all that spoil Carnival, billed as the world's largest
party.
   From the steamy Amazon jungle to the Southern Pampas, they are
donning sequined and feathered costumes in preparation for the
pre-Lenten revelry, which begins Saturday and runs through Ash
Wednesday.
   ``I work all year long until my body aches. The world's so full
of misery and suffering, but Carnival lets me let it all hang
out,'' said Leila de Souza, 32. She works at odd jobs, makes $20 a
week and plans to parade with one of Rio's famous ``samba schools''
_ clubs from largely black slums.
   Carnival in Rio features grand balls at exclusive clubs and a
costume parade that costs millions to produce. In the northeast,
large outdoor dances are led by bands playing on the back of trucks.
   For the rich, there are balls that attract from 6,000 to 10,000
people each.
   Rio's Monte Libano Club is charging $10,000 for a reserved box
for 12 at its ``Night in Baghdad Ball.'' The club hired 120
security guards to protect drunken partygoers from themselves and
each other. It expects guests to swill down more than 2,000 gallons
of beer and 1,000 bottles of whiskey.
   Other popular dances are the ``Grande Gala G,'' for homosexuals,
and the ``Girl from Ipanema Ball,'' known for its glorification of
the female posterior.
   ``The soul of Carnival here is the same as it is in other places
_ a cry for liberty. We just have a slightly different way of
expressing ourselves,'' said Jose Geraldo Machado, a director of
Rio's municipal tourism board.
   Machado said the special nature of Brazil's Carnival derived
from the population's diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds.
   ``The samba rythmn descends from our African roots, the melodic
line comes from Europe, and the visual beauty from the Indians,''
he said.
   The undeniable highlight of Rio's Carnival, the ``samba school''
parade, is held in two 15-hour marathon sessions on Sunday and
Monday nights.
   Sixteen ``schools'' take part, each with 5,000 dancers and
percussionists, who perform original samba music with floats and
costumes based on the musical theme.
   The schools, which compete for a top prize based on points
awarded for lyrics, dancing, rhythm, floats, and other categories,
march down a six-block outdoor paradeway known as the
``Sambadrome.''
   Female paraders usually wear little more than rhinestone bikinis
and feather headresses, but some dancers spend as much as $15,000
on their attire.
   As always, there are complaints that Carnival is in danger of
becoming a commercialized ``Brazil Follies,'' not a popular
celebration but a show for tourists.
   ``The poor are the greatest samba performers, but they are
increasingly shut out. The cost of a costume is so high, they can't
afford to take part,'' said Rio City Councilman Sergio Cabral.
   But many disagree: ``Samba's in my blood. I'll be out there
dancing every year until I drop,'' said Jose Menezes Ferreira, 50,
who has paraded with the Villa Isabel Samba School for 40 years.
   Machado said that depite a bad year for tourism in Rio, the
13,200 parade tickets reserved for overseas visitors, ranging in
price from $116 to $170, were sold out.

<HEAD>FBI Begins Inquiry Into Police Handling of Stuart Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI is investigating claims that city police
mishandled their probe into the murder of Carol Stuart by
intimidating and coercing witnesses into implicating an early
suspect.
   Police Commissioner Francis M. Roache promised the his
department's cooperation with the investigation, according to a
statement Thursday from FBI agent Thomas Hughes.
   Mayor Raymond Flynn said he welcomed the probe and vowed to take
disciplinary action if any police officers were charged with
wrongdoing.
   Police named William Bennett as a suspect after the pregnant
Mrs. Stuart was shot Oct. 23 and her husband, Charles Stuart, was
seriously wounded in the city's Mission Hill neighborhood.
   Stuart's statement to police that a black gunman shot him and
his wife touched off a massive manhunt that many black residents
said violated their civil rights.
   Bennett was cleared of suspicion after Stuart apparently
committed suicide Jan. 4, after learning that his brother had
implicated him in the crime.
   The FBI investigation stems from statements by several people
who claim police coerced them into implicating Bennett.
   Derek Jackson, 17, has claimed that police threatened him with
20 years in prison if he did not tell them under oath about an
alleged confession made by Bennett. He claims also to have been
threatened with a beating.
   Jackson said he recanted his story when he voluntarily appeared
before the grand jury investigation into the Stuart case in
November.
   Three other teen-agers that police said were present when
Bennett made his alleged confession also have said they were forced
into making false statements.
   Mary Smith, 43, has claimed that police offered to release her
son from juvenile custody and relocate her family if she cooperated
in the Stuart investigation.
   Ms. Smith told police she had seen Bennett on the night of the
shooting with what appeared to be a gun, but noted that his
clothing was not similar to the description originally offered by
Stuart.
   She said the police threatened to put her daughter in juvenile
detention if she did not amend her statement to make it match
Stuart's description.

   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland and
Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole sat side by side, anxious for a
phone call to go through to coal miners in Castlewood, Va.
   Rich Trumka, president of the United Mine Workers, placed the
conference call at 9 a.m. Thursday so miners who'd been without a
paycheck for 10 months could hear him officially announce that the
Pittston strike was over.
   Kirkland, Mrs. Dole, Trumka and three others on a platform for
the carefully staged event _ viewed as a coup for both labor and
Mrs. Dole _ held phones to their ears. Trumka made the call and was
put on hold.
   Minutes ticked by. Aides rolled their eyes. Reporters moved
about restlessly. The line was still dead.
   ``Some day,'' Kirkland cracked with a grin, ``we've got to get
organized.''

   Leaders of the 14.1 million member AFL-CIO who held their annual
meeting here Monday through Thursday know they took a beating in
the 1980s, and they good-naturedly admit they have some patching up
to do in the coming decade.
   Union presidents, staff and local labor leaders from around the
nation flock south to Florida every winter for the nation's biggest
labor meeting, as the AFL-CIO's 33-member board sets policy and
maps strategy for the coming year.
   At a reception for reporters on the eve of the opening day, a
New York journalist noted that the shrimp, cheese and wine was a
step up from last year's beer-and-pretzel fare served to the press.
   ``It's a new labor movement for the '90s,'' quipped AFL-CIO
spokesman Rex Hardesty, who has pushed for tight-lipped union
officials to improve their dealings with reporters.

   It was easy to find a party. Even the hotel put one on,
apparently in appreciation for labor's loyalty. The AFL-CIO has
used the same Bal Harbour beachside resort since 1956.
   At the biggest spread of the week, held to honor newly elected
vice presidents like Trumka, piles of crab and oysters were served
under several huge ice sculptures carved in the shape of union
acronyms such as UMW and AFL-CIO.
   At another event sponsored by an insurance company for unions,
bright green cloth bags with the company's logo were free.
   One union worker said she was ordered to take one by her boss,
even though she didn't want to cart it around. ``He said, `Take the
bag. They raised our premiums 300 percent.'''

   Hardesty bristles at occasional stories written about the
opulence of the Bal Harbour resort, where a thatch-roofed cabana
ringed by palm trees is just footsteps from the ocean.
   ``They should just try to keep up with the pace,'' he said.
   Jo-Ann Mort, a spokeswoman for the Amalgamated Clothing and
Textile Workers Union, agreed: ``Not many people are here on
vacation,'' she said. ``You have to be on all the time.''

<TEXT>
   Police clashed with students who staged a
weeklong sit-in at universities to protest living conditions and
police presence on campuses, the official news agency TAP reported.
Hundreds were arrested, it said.
   In a dispatch late Thursday, TAP reported that officers arrested
about 470 people in the raids at the University of Tunis and at
other universities throughout the country Wednesday. No injuries
were reported.
   The sit-in was called by the General Union of Tunisian Students
to protest poor living conditions and the police presence,
according to TAP and Western diplomatic sources in Tunis, who spoke
on condition they not be named.
   Reports in Tunisia newspapers said a ``minority'' of students
associated with the Islamic fundamentalist student union were
trying to use the university ``as a means of exerting political
pressure.'' It did not elaborate.
   Other arrests were reported in the town of Souss, 90 miles south
of the capital. No details were immediately available.

<HEAD>Results Negative on Children's Second Test for Gonorrhea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three children who initially tested
positive for gonorrhea apparently do not have the disease, which
means speculation about the owner of the day-care center they
attended should stop, the man's attorney said.
   J. David Bogenschutz, who is defending John Shaver against
charges of child pornography, said Thursday that subsequent,
negative tests on the children brings the accuracy of the previous
examination into question.
   ``Now the case has gone from something with the stigma of
gonorrhea and possible child molesting to the fact the state has
some pictures they don't like,'' he said. ``And maybe it's time to
take a look at how the testing is being done before someone really
dangerous does fall through the cracks.''
   Police have not charged Shaver, 56, with molesting children. He
was arrested Jan. 28 and charged with five counts of possessing
child pornography for magazines police say they found in his home.
Police also seized hundreds of nude photos of children.
   Shaver was tested for gonorrhea this month, and proved negative,
after police said the children who attended his now-closed Rainbow
Learning Center had positive throat cultures for the disease.
   Police spokesman Ott Cefkin said health officials have told
police that false negatives are not uncommon on gonorrhea tests.
   ``We were told that the health department was 100 percent sure
when they found the gonorrhea that they were certain that that was
what it was,'' Cefkin said. ``They said it was virtually impossible
to have a false positive.
   ``And now you have a negative. It could be a false negative,''
he said.
   Prosecutors were considering having a third test done on the
children, Bogenschutz said.
   Police Capt. Bruce Smith said Thursday that even if John Shaver
had tested positive for the disease, police wouldn't have charged
him with child molestation because the three children have not
incriminated Shaver.
   Shaver was hospitalized briefly following a suicide attempt
before being arrested again on charges of using photos of children
to make pornographic montages. He later posted bond and was
released from jail.

<HEAD>Sihanouk Returns To Live In Cambodia After 11-Year Exile</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRUNNSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ODDAR MEANCHEY, Cambodia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Norodom Sihanouk today
ended 11 years of exile and returned to the land he once ruled,
greeted by Cambodians who waved flags and chanted ``long live his
royal highness.''
   ``All Cambodians want to live in Cambodia and die in Cambodia,''
the guerrilla leader told about 100 reporters bused in for the
homecoming. ``I am 68 years old and I feel more and more I could
die on foreign soil, even if it is friendly foreign soil like China
or North Korea.''
   Since fleeing after Vietnamese invasion in December 1978,
Sihanouk has lived in palaces and luxury hotels in China, North
Korea, Thailand, France and other countries that back his guerrilla
movement.
   Starting today, the prince was to take up residence in a
one-room house without running water or central heating, said his
spokesman, Ek Sereywath.
   The prince smiled and waved as his car crossed from Thailand to
parched scrubland about 300 feet inside the western border province
of Oddar Meanchey, where his guerrillas have made significant
inroads in recent months. About 100 civilians greeted him, as did
dozens of rifle-toting guerrillas.
   Sihanouk said he would live in the ``liberated zone'' until the
entire country was liberated from the Vietnamese-backed government.
   Officials said the prince is to live with his wife, Monique, and
two aides. Cooks will be on hand, and food and supplies will be
brought in from Thailand.
   Ek said the prince will divide his time between two newly
liberated villages that have been renamed Sereipheap, or Freedom,
and Ekareach, or Independence.
   Officials said Sereipheap was about 12 miles from the Thai
frontier but did not give a location for Ekareach. Reporters were
not allowed go to see either village.
   ``They have artillery not far from my house so I have to keep
the location secret,'' the prince explained.
   Sihanouk said he would not command his army from his new home,
but instead concentrate on helping civilians in the liberated zone
with food, medicine and clothing.
   Sihanouk ascended the throne in 1941 and led Cambodia to
independence from the French in 1953. His rule ended in a 1970
military coup after he resisted U.S. attempts to draw Cambodia into
the Indochina War.
   He spent 1975-78 under house arrest as the Communist Khmer Rouge
group embarked on a radical agrarian revolution in which hundreds
of thousands of people died of famine and in slave labor camps and
execution chambers.
   Since 1982, Sihanouk has led the guerrilla coalition that also
includes the Khmer Rouge and the Khmer People's National Liberation
Front. He resigned as coalition president recently, citing charges
that he was ``an accomplice'' of the Khmer Rouge.
   Sihanouk's return home came after peace talks in Bangkok
Wednesday with Hun Sen, prime minister of the Vietnamese-installed
government. Their joint communique vaguely agreed on the need for a
U.N. presence in the country and formation of a ``supreme national
body,'' but there apparantly were no breakthroughs.
   Sihanouk said he repeated his demand for dismantling of the
Phnom Penh government and installing an interim authority
comprising personnel from the United Nations and from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations. But he said the Khmer Rouge
opposed a U.N. administration.
   The guerrillas, the Hun Sen government, Vietnam, France and
Southeast Asian countries are to meet in Cambodian peace talks
starting Monday in Jakarta, Indonesia.

<HEAD>Suit by Smoker's Widow Against Cigarette Company Dismissed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by a
smoker's widow despite a state Supreme Court ruling that she had
the right to sue R.J. Reynolds Co. for failing to warn her late
husband of smoking risks.
   Ann Forster claimed that her husband, John Forster of Golden
Valley, who died of lung cancer in 1985 at age 46, had relied on
representations by Reynolds that cigarette smoking was not
hazardous. He had smoked Camel cigarettes for more than 30 years.
   In the ruling filed earlier this month, Hennepin County District
Judge Jonathan Lebedoff said Forster could not show that her
husband had relied on the slogan, ``I'd walk a mile for a Camel''
as an indication that smoking was not harmful.
   Forster claimed that the cumulative effect of 30 years of
advertising, promotion and public relations was to convince
consumers that there were no health dangers associated with smoking.
   Also dismissed was her claim for breach of express warranty on
the product. Lebedoff ruled that because John Forster was expected
to know about the hazards of smoking, he could not have relied on
any promise to the contrary.
   Forster claimed that R.J. Reynolds had a duty to warn about the
hazards of smoking before 1966, when the Federal Cigarette Labeling
and Advertising Act, requiring such warnings, went into effect.
Lebedoff said the company was not obliged to warn consumers of
health risks before 1966.
   The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled a year ago that the labeling
law made cigarette companies immune from lawsuits claiming that
customers were not warned, but said that it did not relieve them of
the duty to tell the truth in their advertising.
   Lebedoff said he was reluctant to dispose of the case as he did
and was not insensitive to the effect it will have on the Forster
family.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The general secretary of the South African Council
of Churches today said Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has moved
too soon to lift sanctions against South Africa.
   ``The key issue is the dismantling of apartheid and when we have
reached the stage where the dismantling of apartheid is
irreversible, we will blow the whistle,'' the Rev. Frank Chikane
said as he arrived at Heathrow airport.
   ``We are saying that no one has the right to blow the whistle _
particularly the prime minister of this country.''
   Britain split with its partners in the European Community
earlier this week and announced it would lift a ban on new
investment in South Africa.
   Mrs. Thatcher has argued that it is important to make a gesture
of support for South African President F.W. de Klerk following his
decision to release black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela from
prison.
   ``We have asked for sanctions. We have understood that anything
we do to remove apartheid is costly and we are prepared to face
that,'' Chikane said.
   ``Our concern is that Mrs. Thatcher's position has been that of
consent for the leadership of the apartheid system, rather than the
people's organizations.
   ``It is clear she is operating at a level of the interests of
business rather than the interests of the victims of apartheid.'
   Chikane plans to go to Parliament on Tuesday for an
anti-apartheid protest.

<TEXT>
   North Korea will hold a parliamentary election in
April, six months before the scheduled end of the lawmakers'
four-year terms, its official news agency announced today.
   The Korean Central News Agency said the decision by the Standing
Committee of the eighth Supreme People's Assembly to hold the
assembly election was made in a meeting Thursday.
   Members of the current assembly were chosen in an election held
in November 1986. The report, monitored in Tokyo, did not say why
the election was being held six months early.
   The assembly, North Korea's legislature, officially is the
highest government body, but generally serves only to ratify
decisions made by the Communist Party.
   In the past, the assembly usually has met only twice a year,
each time for a few days. A 15-member Standing Committee elected by
the assembly performs legislative functions when the assembly is
not in session.
   At the first assembly session after the election, the assembly's
key posts, including chairman and vice chairman, are elected, and
the new Cabinet is formed.

<TEXT>
   Bitter cold began its assault on the eastern half of the nation
today, creeping into the upper Great Lakes from Canada. Rain
continued, prompting parts of the water-logged South to stack
sandbags in preparation for a wet weekend.
   An arctic snap was due from Minnesota to Georgia to Maine by
Sunday morning with readings as many as 25 degrees below normal.
   Tornadoes touched down Thursday along the Gulf Coast of
Mississippi and in Alabama, devastating dozens of homes, snapping
trees and utility lines and injuring about 30 people.
   Wreckage from Thursday's storms littered a 12-county area
extending south of Montgomery to the Florida state line and east to
the Georgia line.
   Sub-zero temeratures were due today and Saturday from eastern
North Dakota to northern Wisconsin. The East Coast soaked in mild,
humid air in advance of the approaching arctic blast. Rain extended
from Michigan to Florida.
   Snow continued in northern Maine while southern New England
received more rain. New York state and areas near the nation's
capital were swathed in fog. On Thursday, Helena, Mont., broke a
109-year-old record high for Feb. 22 by one degree with a reading
of 55.
   Other highs shattered for the date included 57 in Concord, N.H.;
58 in Portland, Maine; 61 in Providence, R.I.; 63 in Boston; 78 in
Charleston, S.C.; and 80 in Columbia, S.C.
   The warm spell was broken later in the day, with clouds and
cooler temperatures. Rain soaked many of the Atlantic states, and
snow hit Portland today.
   A threat of showers and occasional locally heavy rain continued.
Flood watches were posted for northwestern Pennsylvania, eastern
New York state and southern Vermont.
   Winds from afternoon thunderstorms gusted to 70 mph at
Charlotte, N.C., toppling trees that triggered scattered power
outages. Thunderstorm gusts caused damage near Mooreville, N.C.,
and in Savannah, Ga.
   The National Weather Service in Columbia said a 70 percent
chance of rain and scattered thunderstorms are expected today, but
should end by tonight.
   The coldest temperatures in the nation Thursday was 57 below at
Chandalar, Alaska, and in the lower 48 states, minus 1 at Duchesne,
Utah.
   Thursday's hot spot was Sarasota-Bradenton, Fla., with a reading
of 88.

   The United Nations has developed a
drug-fighting plan that calls for global cooperation in targeting
smuggling, money-laundering and illicit crops.
   The battle plan shaped during a four-day special session on
drugs and expected to be approved today is ``another blow against
those trying to peddle drugs around the world,'' said Melvin
Levitsky, assistant U.S. secretary of state for narcotics matters.
   The plan urges countries plagued by trafficking to establish
joint border checkpoints. It also encourages national drug
enforcement agencies to work with Interpol, the international law
enforcement organization, to help investigate drug-linked
activities and train personnel in countries facing mounting
narcotics problems and related crimes.
   The document, however, stresses that the anti-drug efforts must
not violate the international rights of any countries.
   ``It is very important to create an international code against
drugs so that those who either take drugs or sell drugs are
considered pariahs in the international community,'' Levitsky said.
   A senior U.S. administration official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said some of the measures were not as strong as American
negotiators had hoped they would be.
   He said the U.S. government wanted more precise language
outlining the obligations of all countries in the areas of law
enforcement and economic aid for nations battling powerful drug
traffickers.
   ``But it's a document we can support,'' the official said.
   The plan stresses the need to prevent the international banking
system and other financial institutions from being used for
laundering profits from the illicit drug trade.
   It also calls for prompt eradication and substitution of crops
that produce raw material for illicit narcotics, such as coca
plants used in making cocaine and opium poppy plants that yield
heroin.
   Measures to expand opportunities for trade and investment for
countries where illegal drug production has led to severe economic
problems should be high priorities, the document said.
   The plan also calls for steps to prevent covert transfers of
arms and explosives to drug traffickers, and urged strict measures
to prevent private aircraft and ships from engaging in illicit
trade.

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 3 grafs to UPDATE with East Berlin mayor
resigning; picks up 3rd pvs, `Communist Premier...'</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Panic-buying by East Germans is emptying
store shelves of flour, sugar and meat, but the government promised
emergency measures to keep up basic food supplies and called in the
army to help with food deliveries.
   In East Berlin, Communist Mayor Erhard Krack resigned today,
assuming political responsibility for a rigged election in May. He
was the latest Communist official to quit under pressure in recent
weeks.
   Others have defected to the left-wing Social Democratic Party,
widely expected to be the dominant political force in East Germany
after elections March 18. The party on Thursday opened its first
national convention in Leipzig.
   Communist Premier Hans Modrow and other East German leaders have
called for an end to the hoarding and panic-shopping that have hit
the nation's already poorly stocked stores.
   ``We are in an extraordinary situation in which emergency
measures have become necessary,'' Commerce Minister Manfred Flegel
told a news conference Thursday in East Berlin.
   He said the government has ordered stepped-up slaughtering of
animals for more meat and more shifts in food production. He said
it was considering extra imports.
   Officials may have to dip into the national emergency food
reserves the government keeps on hand in case of a major crisis,
Flegel said, but he declined to elaborate.
   ``The government will maintain a stable food supply under all
circumstances,'' Flegel said. ``The army has already had to provide
vehicles to help with food deliveries.''
   Flegel said the government-run food stores were reporting
``three to four'' times their normal revenue as consumers rush to
buy flour, sugar, meat, butter and jam.
   Tens of thousands of East Germans also have bought food in
neighboring West Germany and West Berlin.
   A cut in subsidies for food production has helped to trigger the
run on food. East Germans also are concerned about the expected
adoption of the West German mark as a first step toward a unified
Germany, and the rate at which they will be able to exchange their
savings.
   In Leipzig, Social Democratic chief Ibrahim Boehme told more
than 500 party delegates that the Social Democrats ``are asking
people to stay in this country and to work together in building up
a democracy.''
   Boehme was referring to the continuing daily drain of about
2,000 East Germans to the West despite moves toward reform and
German unification since the hard-line Communist government of
Erich Honecker was ousted in October.
   East Germany's Social Democrats will make former Bonn Chancellor
Willy Brandt an honorary chairman during the convention. The
leftist West German Social Democrats under Brandt's guidance have
been providing support to their East German sister party.
   West German politicians have been become increasingly active in
the East German election campaign, leading to protests from the
Communists.
   Modrow's caretaker government called for slashing the armed
forces of the unified Germany by two-thirds of present combined
forces, and called for some U.S. and Soviet troops to remain during
the unification process.
   East Germany's defense minister, Adm. Theodor Hoffmann, said a
joint German military should be reduced to about 300,000 members
initially, and later to 150,000-200,000.
   West Germany belongs to NATO and East Germany is in the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. About 380,000 Soviet soldiers are stationed
in East Germany and NATO has more than 300,000 in West Germany,
including about 250,000 Americans.
   In Munich, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily newspaper said Modrow
had decided against being the embattled Communists' top candidate
in next month's national elections. However, a party spokesman said
no final decision had been made.
   In Bonn, a West German government spokesman said only the
government of a united Germany could give Poland a guarantee of its
borders, West German television reported.
   The ZDF television report quoted government spokesman Dieter
Vogel as saying the formula for achieving German unification had
been set by the victorious World War II Allies in Ottawa last week.
   Under the plan, the Allies and the two Germanys would take part
in unification talks.
   But he said this would include consultations with Poland's
government, according to the TV report.
   Poland, invaded by a unified Germany in World War II, has
demanded West Germany guarantee that the existing borders of the
Germanys would not change under unification.
   Some West German conservatives believe that Germany maintains a
claim on Polish territory that belonged to Germany before the war.

<TEXT>
   The dollar was higher against other major
currencies in moderately active trading in Europe late this
morning, but traders said the U.S. currency was expected to remain
in a narrow range.
   Gold prices fell.
   The main feature of the foreign exchange market was that the
Bank of Japan moved twice to support the yen in Europe through the
sale of dollars, selling the dollar at 147 yen, market sources said.
   Traders said it appeared the Bank of Japan was trying to force
the dollar to hold at or move below 147 yen and might intervene
directly or through other central banks throughout the day.
   The yen support in Europe follows dollar sales by the Bank of
Japan in Tokyo earlier in the day, dealers said.
   Reports that Japan's Ministry of Finance has come out against a
further rise in the country's discount rate against the judgment of
the Bank of Japan had led to dollar buying by investors throughout
the Asian day.
   In Tokyo, the dollar was up strongly against the Japanese yen,
closing at 146.47 yen, up 1.24 yen from Thursday's close. Later in
London, the dollar was quoted at 147.05 yen.
   In Europe, the dollar benefited from a sudden weakness in the
West German mark, traders said.
   But traders said the dollar ran into strong resistance as
profit-taking set in.
   Traders said the dollar was viewed as weak from a fundamental
point of view.
   ``The U.S. economy seems to be entering into a situation of
stagflation and that's not good,'' one Milan trader said.
   The mark has lost some of its attraction because of indications
that the German monetary unification might not be as smooth as
believed earlier.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Thursday:
   _1.6764 West German marks, up from 1.6695
   _1.4747 Swiss francs, up from 1.4725
   _5.6748 French francs, up from 5.6580
   _1.8915 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8845
   _1,238.85 Italian lire, up from 1,234.25
   _1.2010 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1945
   In London, the dollar traded at $1.7081, compared with $1.7145
late Thursday.
   Gold opened at $414.50 in London and by midmorning, London's
major gold dealers fixed a recommend price of $415 a troy ounce,
down from $417.45 bid late Thursday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $415.25, down from $417.25 late
Thursday.
   Gold in Hong Kong dropped $3.14 an ounce today to close at
$413.69.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.24 a troy ounce from
Thursday's $5.28.

   Dale Layton wasted no time when he spotted a
train bearing down on a man in a wheelchair stuck on railroad
tracks.
   ``I knew if I was going to get there I was going to have to get
with it,'' said Layton, one of 19 Americans and Canadians
recognized Thursday by the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission for
risking their lives to save others.
   Layton, a retired funeral director from Canby, Ore., heard the
train's whistle blaring non-stop, and saw the train careening
toward Lawrence Supnet, 28, of Portland, stuck in the tracks at a
crossing on Nov. 17, 1988.
   ``I turned and ran just as fast as I could run,'' Layton said in
a telephone interview.
   ``I just gave the chair one yank and tilted it back. I bet it
wasn't five heartbeats from the time I grabbed it and the time the
train was there.''
   Layton and the winners received a medal and $2,500. The
commission has honored 7,424 people since its founding in 1904 by
industrialist Andrew Carnegie.
   Five of those honored Thursday died in their rescue attempts.
   One recipient, James Stack III _ who had recently left prison
after serving two years on a rape conviction _ was honored for
coming to the rescue of a stabbing victim during an attack March
14, 1989, on a bus in Bloomington, Ill.
   The others recognized were:
   _Garry W. Proffit, 34, of Hollywood, Md., drowned trying to pull
a man from a water storage tank in Lusby, Md., on Sept. 15, 1988.
   _Michael G. Martinez, 40, of Hialeah, Fla., died of a heart
attack after saving an unidentified woman from drowning in the
Atlantic Ocean at Miami Beach, Fla., May 29, 1989.
   _John K. Aiena, 44, of Beaumont, Texas, died trying to save a
man from drowning in a Port Arthur, Texas, marina May 26, 1989.
   _Betty B. Lamb, 69, of Sacramento, Calif., died trying to save
her 3-year-old grandson from drowning in the Pacific Ocean July 12,
1989, in Jenner, Calif. The child also died.
   _Keith A. Jensen, 33, of New Denmark, New Brunswick, died trying
to save his parents from their burning home Jan. 31, 1988, in New
Brunswick.
   _James K. Webb of Fishkill, N.Y., and Richard Gustin of
Lagrangeville, N.Y., both 25, helped rescue three men from a
burning car in Buchanan, N.Y., on April 11, 1989.

two vehicles that caught fire after colliding in Antioch on March
23, 1989.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Bob Martinez called for a criminal
investigation of a rap group because of its hot-selling album with
sexually explicit lyrics.
   Martinez asked Peter Antonacci, Florida's statewide prosecutor,
to conduct an investigation into whether Florida's Racketeer
Influenced, Corrupt Organizations Act and obscenity laws have been
violated by the widespread distribution of records by ``The 2 Live
Crew'' and other rap groups.
   A Fort Myers judge ruled two weeks ago that there was probable
cause to find that ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' was obscene and
ordered the album, which has sold more than 1 million copies,
pulled from the shelves in Lee County.
   Shortly after Martinez released his letter Thursday, a jury
acquitted an Alexander City, Ala., record store owner of obscenity
charges for selling a sexually explicit tape of ``Move Somethin'''
by 2 Live Crew.
   The Circuit Court jury took less than 1{ hours to decide in
favor of Tommy Hammond, who earlier was found guilty in Municipal
Court in what the American Civil Liberties Union called the
nation's first obscenity conviction for music. Hammond had appealed
that conviction and was granted a trial in the higher court.
   In Martinez' letter, he said he was appalled that music a judge
has already determined may be obscene was easily available to
Florida children. He said he was horrified by reports that
seventh-graders can recite some of the lyrics.
   Some of the four-member band's lyrics include descriptions of
gang rapes, sex acts and sadomasochism.
   A spokeswoman for Skyywalker Records, the Miami record company
that produced the album, referred inquiries to the company's
lawyer, who was unavailable for comment Thursday.
   Martinez said he did not think the state should try to censor
``the kind of legitimate public expression protected by the First
Amendment.'' He claimed that 2 Live Crew's album doesn't meet that
standard.
   Under state law, the penalty for distributing an obscene record
or tape is a maximum five-year sentence and a $1,000 fine.
   The state Racketeer Influenced, Corrupt Organizations statute,
which includes obscenity violations, carries a maximum prison term
of 30 years.
   ``Since the sale of the recording apparently has numbered in the
tens of thousands, the pattern of racketeering activity is arguably
present,'' Martinez wrote Antonacci.
   But Charlene Carres, a Tallahassee attorney for the ACLU, said
works with literary, artistic, political or scientific value were
not covered by the obscenity statute.
   From Washington, People for the American Way issued a scathing
statement, noting Martinez' failed attempt last year to pass an
anti-abortion statute.
   ``First Governor Martinez tried to rob women of their
reproductive rights,'' said Elliot Mincberg, legal director of the
organization. ``Now he's advocating censorship and taking aim at
the First Amendment. One wonders what fundamental right is next on
his hit parade.''

<HEAD>Law Faculty Votes to End School Payment of Professors' ABA Dues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS P. WYMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Law professors at the University of
Notre Dame voted to end the school's payment of their American Bar
Association dues to protest the association's vote to condemn
curtailment of abortion rights.
   The school traditionally has paid the $1,900 ABA dues for each
of the 30 law faculty members. But they voted Monday to end the
perquisite and leave each law professor the decision to maintain
membership at their own expense.
   ``We're not saying they should have taken the opposite
position,'' said law dean David T. Link of a bar association vote
opposing government intervention in a woman's decision to end a
pregnancy.
   ``They just shouldn't be in this when you think of the division
that still exists among members of the bar association and in the
courts,'' he said Thursday.
   No other law school or legal organization has taken a similar
step, said Nancy Slonim, a spokeswoman at the ABA's Chicago
headquarters. The Texas state bar has scheduled a vote to decide
whether to withdraw from the ABA's policy-making house of delegates
over the abortion issue.
   The delegates, meeting Feb. 13 in Los Angeles, voted by a 2-1
margin to oppose legislation or other government action ``that
interferes with the confidential relationship between a pregnant
woman and a physician, or with the decision to terminate the
pregnancy.''
   Supporters of the resolution were reacting to the Supreme
Court's Webster decision in 1989 affirming Missouri efforts to
restrict access to abortion.
   Link said the faculty stand should not be interpreted as
opposition to women's rights. ``Like any other constitutional
question, it's not a matter of whether rights exist, but how do you
balance competing rights,'' he said.
   About 80 percent of the law faculty at the Catholic school are
members of the Roman Catholic Church, Link said. But the faculty
vote represented a professional, not a religious, objection, he
said.
   Link did not disclose totals of the vote.
   ``The ABA ought to take positions in things unifying to the ABA,
rather than divisive, because it interferes with the rights of some
minority members,'' Link said.
   The ABA has received about 80 resignations from among 365,000
members nationwide since approving the abortion policy, Ms. Slonim
said. The association has taken stands on controversial, unresolved
issues, including opposition to discrimination against homosexuals
and opposition to the death penalty for juveniles and the mentally
disturbed, she said.
   Link said he may resign his personal membership if the ABA
resolution is allowed to stand.
   Notre Dame enrolls 510 students in its 121-year-old law school,
the nation's oldest Catholic law school.

<HEAD>Governor Tries to Dissuade Local Opposition to Pesticide Spraying</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gov. George Deukmejian unsuccessfully tried
to persuade local officials to abandon their newest legal
challenges to the state's aerial pesticide spraying program to
eradicate the Medfly.
   The Republican governor met in Pasadena on Thursday with
Pasadena and Glendale city officials, but the discussion yielded no
agreements on the state's pesticide spraying program or on a new
Pasadena ordinance prohibiting low-level nighttime helicopter
formation flights.
   Deukmejian said spraying of the pesticide malathion will
continue despite local leaders' growing opposition and their
concerns the pesticide could cause health risks.
   ``I know in my own heart that what we are doing is not harmful
to the people. Not only in my heart, but in my mind based on the
evidence,'' he said.
   After the meeting, Pasadena and Glendale city leaders said they
will continue to oppose spraying because of health concerns.
   ``There continues to be a very honest difference of opinion,''
said Glendale Councilman Carl Raggio. ``We went into the meeting
with that and came out of the meeting with the same feelings.''
   A joint lawsuit by the cities of Los Angeles, Burbank and
Glendale was filed against the state in Superior Court Thursday,
seeking an immediate halt to helicopter missions raining malathion
on Southern California communities.
   The Orange County cities of Garden Grove, Huntington Beach and
Westminster recently failed in a similar suit heard by a Sacramento
County Superior Court Judge.
   The suit filed Thursday alleges the missions violate residents'
civil rights because they have a right to be free of health risks
from toxic chemicals.
   Helicopters took to the skies overnight to spray a
30-square-mile area of the Verdugo hills in Burbank and Glendale as
part of the state's $30 million Medfly eradication campaign, which
covers over 400 square miles of Los Angeles and Orange counties.
   Pasadena City Attorney Victor Kaleta was awaiting a police
report that could enable him to file criminal misdemeanor
complaints against helicopter pilots who sprayed malathion over the
city early Thursday.
   Agriculture officials maintain malathion is safe and its use
necessary to prevent the Medfly from causing up to $200 million in
annual losses to the state's agricultural industry.
   The Medfly lays its eggs in more than 250 varieties of fruits,
vegetables and nuts grown in California. The crops are destroyed
when the larvae hatch and growing maggots eat their way out.

   The state Senate passed a bill giving
California one of the earliest presidential primaries in the
nation, but political leaders said the real fight over the bill was
still to come.
   The bill approved in the Senate on Thursday would jolt the
nation's candidate-selection process.
   It had been bottled up in the Senate since September and was
approved only after its supporters promised to send it to a
Democrat-dominated two-house conference committee for more
negotiations.
   But Democrat and Republican leaders expressed doubt that the
committee could draft a bipartisan compromise the bill appears to
need to become law.
   ``It's not looking very good right now,'' said Senate Republican
leader Ken Maddy.
   In June, the Assembly approved a version of the bill that would
schedule California's primary election on the first Tuesday in
March during presidential election years, with the change beginning
in 1992.
   That would place the primary of the nation's most populous
state, now one of the last to be held, on the heels of the Iowa
caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. According to the latest
state Finance Department figures, California has about 29.1 million
people.
   California has not played a key role in a presidential primary
since 1972, when George McGovern's victory propelled him to the
Democratic nomination. Supporters of the bill say a June primary
usually gives California voters little voice in selecting
presidential nominees.
   In non-presidential years, the primary would remain on its
current date, the first Tuesday after the first Monday in June.
   The vote Thursday in the Democrat-controlled Senate was 24-11.
Six Republicans joined 17 Democrats and an independent in
supporting the bill. Seven Republicans and four Democrats voted no.
   The bill has hit a series of snags since it was introduced.
Senate Republicans fear the reapportionment of their legislative
districts following the 1990 census may not be completed by March
1992. They do not want to run for re-election in 1992 in the
current districts, which were drawn up by Democrats.
   One solution would be to hold two primaries, one in March for
presidential candidates and another later in the year, probably
June or September, for state and congressional candidates.
   But Senate leader David Roberti, a Democrat, is strongly opposed
to the idea of two primaries, saying three statewide elections in a
year _ a general election and two primaries _ would boost costs and
reduce voter turnout.
   ``I am opposed; I am very opposed,'' he said, adding that a
two-primary bill would face ``rough sledding'' in the Senate.
   Whatever the conference committee produces would need final
approval from both houses to go to Republican Gov. George
Deukmejian, who has said he favors the idea of two primaries.

   A police officer shot an apparently homeless
man to death in a scuffle just across Pennsylvania Avenue from the
White House.
   U.S. Park Police officer Katherine Heller came across a man in
Lafayette Park on Thursday evening who had been assaulted, said Lt.
Reginald L. Smith, spokesman for District of Columbia police.
   Heller then radioed a description of the alleged attacker and
another Park Police officer, Scott Dahl, spotted a man fitting the
description of the suspect, Smith said.
   Dahl approached the man, who began fighting with the officer and
managed to take the officer's pistol away from him, Smith said. At
that point, Ms. Heller approached and shot the man in the chest, he
said.
   The wounded man, who was not identified, was pronounced dead at
George Washington University Hospital. The officers were treated
for minor injuries and released.
   On most evenings, homeless men and women are scattered through
Lafayette Park, sleeping on benches or huddled near its information
center.
   A Park Police official told The Washington Post that the slain
man was a regular in the park.

   An opposition lawmaker said
today the government should investigate a magistrate's decision to
impose only a small fine on a white farmer convicted of beating a
black worker who died the next day.
   The farmer, Wilhelm Rabe, was fined the equivalent of $40 on
Feb. 12 for assaulting Ekati Xaba last year on a farm near the
eastern border with Swaziland.
   Magistrate J.D. Jacquire accepted evidence that Rabe had beaten
Xaba with an electric cord, but rejected testimony that the worker
also was thrown to the ground and kicked.
   Jacquire said there was no proof that the beating caused the
brain haemmorrhage and ruptured spleen that were blamed for Xaba's
death the day after the beating.
   Lester Fuchs, a Parliament member for the anti-apartheid
Democratic Party, said the sentence was excessively lenient and
could cause negative publicity for South Africa at a time when the
government is promoting racial reconciliation. He asked that
Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee account for the magistrate's ruling.
   According to The Sowetan, the country's largest black-oriented
daily newspaper, two people who witnessed the beating had given
statements to police but were never called to testify in court.
   The Sowetan said Xaba's widow and six children were forced to
leave the farm after his death and now live in a one-room cardboard
shack.
   There have been at least two other similar cases in the past
three years, in which white farmers avoided prison despite being
convicted of fatal assaults of black employees.
   Several blacks convicted of murdering white farmers are on Death
Row, facing hanging if the government lifts a recently declared
moratorium on executions.

   The Communist Party today repeated an appeal for
Soviets to avoid ``chaos'' during nationwide rallies planned this
weekend, indicating a growing concern the protests might lead to
renewed unrest.
   The party's policy-making Central Committee urged ``the Soviet
working people'' to ``rebuff all who push people to chaos, provoke
conflicts, ethnic strife and enmity and create instability in
society.''
   The appeal was issued Thursday and repeated on radio and TV
today.
   Rallies are planned Sunday, a week before the balloting in some
republics, and grew out of the success of a Feb. 4 protest when
tens of thousands paraded through Moscow demanding the Communist
Party give up its grip on power.
   The rallies and demonstrations will be the first major public
gatherings since the Central Committee voted to renounce its
monopoly on power Feb. 7, paving the way for establishment of a
multi-party democracy.
   Many of the rallies are being organized by Popular Front
movements striving for greater pluralism since they sprang up in
the last two years.
   On Tuesday, the Soviet legislature issued a decree calling on
local authorities to crack down on illegal protests Sunday and to
strictly control those demonstrations that are permitted.
   Organizers of Sunday's rally in Moscow have received permission
to gather, and the official news agency Tass quoted Vladimir
Kamchatov of the Elector's Association as saying that up to 300,000
people could turn out.
   Demonstrations are planned in a number of provincial cities in
the sweeping Russian republic, which stretches from Finland to the
Sea of Japan, and come shortly before elections to the local
legislatures in Russia on March 4. Elections are scheduled in the
Ukraine and Byelorussia on that day as well.
   Groups in the Uzbekistan capital of Tashkent have been denied
permission to hold an outdoor rally, although an indoor meeting
will be allowed. Leningrad activists were denied a request to stage
a march and instead will hold a rally at a sports complex.
   Mikhail Tkachev, leader of the Byelorussian Popular Front, said
his movement will demand registration of candidates that local
authorities have refused to place on the ballot at the meeting in
the capital of Minsk.
   At the rally, he said, demonstrators will ``express our distrust
in the republic's political leadership and press for their
resignation and the banishing of party organizations from
enterprises, colleges, army and law enforcement organs.''
   Demonstrations are planned throughout the Ukraine, which last
summer was rocked by strikes and where regional party leaders have
been resigning with growing regularity under public pressure.
   All independent political groups have been invited to take part
in a rally in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, while the regional
strike committee formed last summer is leading the rally in Donetsk.
   In Azerbaijan, where a state of emergency imposed Jan. 20
following a bloody week of ethnic unrest is still in effect, Yusis
Samed Oglu of the Popular Front said no rallies were planned out of
fear that soldiers would use force against the crowd.
   The three Baltic republics where the drive for independence is
strong and the achievements in gaining autonomy have been greatest
of all 15 republics are so far taking a low-key approach to the day
of demonstrations.
   Rallies are not scheduled in Lithuania, which is holding
elections Saturday, or in neighboring Latvia, which is gearing up
for elections to the republican legislature on March 18.
   However, activists in the third and smallest Baltic republic of
Estonia said a gathering was being organized for Sunday.

   Hundreds of demonstrators clashed with
police outside the Vienna State Opera as socialites waltzed inside,
and authorities said today that at least 69 people were injured.
   The 1,300 demonstrators were demanding that funds raised to
finance the annual opera ball be spent for social programs to help
the poor and homeless.
   The violence outside the opera peaked as President Kurt Waldheim
and his wife arrived to attend the event Thursday night. But the
nearly 3,000 police officers on hand ushered them and other
dignitaries safely inside.
   Although two leftist groups received permits for the protest,
police said they were not responsible for the violence. Police
President Guenter Boegl said the clashes were triggered by
right-wing radicals who joined the protest.
   A police communique today said at least 69 people were injured
in clashes around the opera, including 60 policemen and nine
demonstrators. Ten other demonstrators were taken into custody, it
said.
   The demonstrators were protesting the display of wealth and
pageantry at the ball. Some posters said, ``Gobble up the rich.''
   Police used shields to ward off stones and bottles as they
charged the crowd with clubs and dogs, witnesses and reporters
said. Scuffles also broke out between demonstrators and groups of
right-wingers, police reported.
   Reporters watching the scene said police action at times
appeared uncoordinated and haphazard, with some officers rounding
up inactive demonstrators and others driving into the crowd on
motorcycles.
   Some of the chaos may have resulted from police radio contact
being briefly disrupted by pirate transmitters, deriding or abusing
police officials.
   Radical demonstrators smashed shopwindows and damaged cars in
streets near the opera, a police statement said.
   Cordons of police ringed the opera, blocking access to the
building.
   In demonstrations last year, about 40 people were reported
injured.
   Inside the opera, an unsmiling Princess Caroline of Monaco was
almost crushed by more pushing and shoving by scores of news
photographers trying to get the best shot. One stepped on her gown.
   Caroline ascended to her box, trying to ignore the
photographers. She later refused an interview for Austrian state
television, sitting stolidly in a box.
   About 7,000 people attended the opera ball. The price of a
ticket was $183. The most expensive box cost more than $12,000.

   Taxi driver Alie Dura Kamara got divorced this
week _ from all three of his wives. His lawyer says he wants to
marry again.
   ``The gentleman is from West Africa, and I had to tell him that
Americans have some strange and quaint habits about wives _ only
one at a time,'' said Kamara's attorney, Gregory Z. Schroeder.
   ``It's the first time I've granted three divorces at the same
time to one man,'' Fulton Superior Court Senior Judge Charles A.
Wofford said Thursday.
   Wofford said he wondered how Kamara, 40, had avoided being
charged with bigamy. Asked about that, District Attorney Lewis R.
Slaton was frank about it. ``We don't have any room in our jail for
bigamists,'' he said. ``They're just going to have to wait their
turn. We'll get to them when we can.''
   Kamara married his first wife in 1976 in his native Sierra
Leone, where having multiple wives is a sign of prosperity. The
couple moved to the United States, then separated in 1981,
according to court documents. He married a second woman in 1983,
and separated from her before marrying in Atlanta for a third time
in 1986. None of the women contested the divorce.
   Kamara retained custody of two children.
   Schroeder said Kamara wanted the divorces because he wants to
``clean up his life.''
   ``I think he wants to get married again,'' Schroeder added.

<TEXT>
   A record medical malpractice award is
causing some West Virginia obstetricians to turn away new patients
and consider leaving the state, where their ranks already have been
halved in five years.
   ``Some will probably leave if they get a chance. I would
leave,'' Dr. Ujjal Sandhu said Thursday. ``I don't want to worry
about losing my shirt. The patients will have to go out of state
just like the doctors are leaving.''
   A county jury in Charleston last week awarded a couple $15.25
million after they claimed their obstetrician failed to perform a
Caesarean section to prevent brain damage to their newborn. It was
the state's highest malpractice award against an obstetrician.
   Mark and Julie Robinson of Cabin Creek, about 15 miles east of
Charleston, said Dr. Kanoj K. Biswas, a Charleston obstetrician,
should have performed the Caesarean section on July 31, 1987, after
their son, who weighed more than 10 pounds, became stuck in the
birth canal.
   Instead, the couple said Biswas used forceps to remove the baby,
causing fetal asphyxia and a brain hemorrhage. The doctor's lawyer
had argued that the child had an abnormal heart and the his
treatment during birth was not the cause of his medical problems.
   ``We're working scared,'' Sandhu said. ``Malpractice awards are
skyrocketing. There should be some reasonable compensation to
victims, but they shouldn't be made millionaires overnight.''
   Sandhu and at least seven other Charleston obstetricians have
decided not to take new patients, he said. Some are leaving to
practice in neighboring states with lower insurance costs and
limits on medical malpractice awards.
   The decline in obstetricians has worsened in the state in recent
years, said Dr. Bruce Berry, chairman of West Virginia's section of
the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.
   Berry said the state now has 65 registered obstetricians, down
from 135 five years ago. Twenty-one family practioners also deliver
babies, but the state hasn't been able to recruit new physicians,
Berry said.
   There were 23,045 babies born in West Virginia last year,
according to state figures.
   West Virginia has been troubled by problems keeping physicians
of all kinds. Last year, the state had 152 doctors per 100,000
residents, 37th among the states, according to the American Medical
Association. Some counties have no doctors at all.
   Berry said he quit practicing obstetrics 14 months ago in
Charleston mainly because of the high cost of malpractice insurance.
   West Virginia Medical Association officials are trying to
determine how other obstetricians are reacting to the malpractice
award, said Executive Director George Rider.
   Dr. Paul Fulcher of Charleston, who also stopped taking new
pregnant patients because of the recent case, said such malpractice
awards leave him ``virtually uninsured.''
   Fulcher said most obstetricians carry a minimum $1 million
malpractice insurance. The maximum coverage is $10 million, Berry
said.
   West Virginia physicians pay about $63,000 in liability
insurance annually, sometimes twice as much as doctors in Virginia
and Kentucky, Rider said. He said he is uncertain why malpractice
insurance costs more in West Virginia.
   High insurance costs are making it harder for pregnant women to
find a physician, Fulcher said.
   ``The main thing is we want to ensure the availability of health
care and provide our expertise without our personal and family
assets being on the line,'' Fulcher said. ``I want to continue
practicing in this state, but I won't make my family liable.''
   Berry said the average delivery costs $1,200 to $1,500. Patients
would have to pay $500 more to cover liability insurance if an
obstetrician took out a $10 million policy, he said.
   The medical association has been unsuccessful in attempts to cap
malpractice awards; other states' caps have been declared
unconstitutional, officials said.
   Instead, Fulcher said, some obstetricians have proposed a
reserve fund to cover large malpractice awards. But he said another
$15 million award would wipe out the fund.
   Del. Bobby Hatfield of Kanawha, chairwoman of the House Health
and Human Resources Committee, said the state will consider
legislation establishing excess insurance funds to help physicians.
   Obstetricians said they need help soon.
   ``I love my job and delivering babies, but I want better
protection,'' Sandhu said. ``They may just quit delivering babies
in this state.''

<HEAD>Los Angeles Harbor Closed by Cargo Ship's Propane Leak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Busy Los Angeles Harbor was closed to ship
traffic while authorities pondered how to remove a leaking canister
of propane gas from a cargo ship today without sparking an
explosion or fire.
   The harbor was closed to incoming and outgoing vessels about
11:30 p.m. Thursday after officials discovered propane leaking from
a canister in the cargo hold of the Evergroup, said Coast Guard
spokeswoman Elizabeth Fleming.
   No evacuations from nearby ships and no injuries were reported.
   Crew members who left the ship when the leak was discovered
reboarded the vessel at Berth 229 ``to shut down all the ship's
systems ... anything that might cause a spark,'' Ms. Fleming said.
   ``The gas is not poisonous, but it is flammable,'' said Coast
Guard Petty Officer Robert Beals. ``They're thinking about flooding
it with (carbon dioxide) in the moring, to prevent a fire or
explosion in the port.''
   Coast Guard and city fire officials planned to huddle this
morning to determine the safest way to remove the canister, said
Fire Capt. Craig Fletcher.
   Fire officials first began receiving reports about a strange
smell in the harbor late Wednesday, but were not able to discover
its source until late Thursday, Fletcher said.
   ``It was really hard to find because the winds kept changing,''
he said.
   Fire officials initially dispatched a fire boat, six engine
companies and hazardous materials team to the scene, said Fletcher.
   Firefighters were released overnight, but are expected to be
sent back when the canister is removed from the ship, he said.
   The harbor, located about 25 miles south of downtown, is the
nation's second busiest port.

   The U.S. Navy today told vessels to steer
at least four miles clear of a burning Kuwaiti tanker while an army
of salvage boats worked around the clock to keep its volatile cargo
from exploding again.
   The U.S.-flagged Surf City was loaded with naphtha and diesel
fuel for Italy on Thursday when a blast ripped through it in the
Persian Gulf, 20 miles off the United Arab Emirates coast. The ship
was still billowing smoke today.
   Its American captain and first mate were killed, but the 23
other sailors, all Americans but one, were rescued by U.S.
warships. Four were hospitalized, but their conditions were not
known.
   Officials ruled out sabotage or a floating mine as the cause and
said a short circuit may have sparked the blast aboard the ship,
which was owned by the Kuwaiti Oil Tanker Co. It had been reflagged
for U.S. protection during the Iran-Iraq war.
   ``The explosion according to our reports occurred above the
waterline,'' said C. Miles Sheldon, head of Chesapeake Shipping
Inc., the subsidiary used by the Kuwait Oil Tanker Co. to operate
its American-owned tankers.
   The huge blaze that burned through the night on the ship was
contained, but the ship's condition was uncertain, Sheldon told a
news conference in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates.
   He said the Surf City was listing three degrees as a result of
the loss of cargo. The lost cargo was only naphtha, which burns
easily and evaporates, causing minimal pollution, he said.
   U.S. Navy officials told ships in the area to stay at least four
miles away from the ship, which was being monitored by the USS
Simpson, a missile frigate.
   ``The accommodation quarters are still smoldering, and the heat
could blow up the cargo, which would be a major disaster,'' said a
shipping source in the southern Persian Gulf, who spoke on
condition on anonymity.
   Two salvage tugboats from the Kuwaiti Oil Tanker Co. joined half
a dozen others from the United Arab Emirates overnight, dousing the
tanker with foam and water to fend off a more serious explosion,
the shipping sources said.
   The source said the front part of the ship was only about two
feet above water. The tugboats were trying to keep it from sinking.
   Because the explosion occurred halfway near the Iranian island
of Abu Musa, it provoked speculation that it might have been caused
by an Iranian mine or other explosive. The Iranian Revolutionary
Guards used the island as a base for ship attacks during the
1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
   Capt. Ron Wildermuth, chief spokesman for the Central Command in
Florida which oversees the U.S. naval forces, said initial reports
indicated the explosion was caused by an internal accident.
   Abdul-Fattah al-Bader, the chairman of the Kuwait Oil Tanker
Co., told reporters in Kuwait that he ruled out sabotage,
attributing the fire to a short circuit.
   The U.S. Navy identified the dead as Derrick F. Linardich, the
38-year-old captain of Norfolk, Va.; and Steven P. McHugh, the
34-year-old first mate from East Bridgewater, Mass.
   Sheldon said the bodies had been recovered and would be sent
home after formalities were completed in Dubai.
   The U.S. Navy has a 10-unit Middle East Force in the gulf, and
monitors movement of U.S.-flagged ships in the gulf from a
distance. It officially ceased the regular escorts it used to
conduct at the height of the Iran-Iraq war, mainly from Iranian
threats.
   Kuwait, whose tankers were a primary target of the Iranians,
re-registered 11 of its tankers in the United States to give them
the right to the U.S. Navy protection. A few months after the U.N.
cease-fire halted the 8-year Persian Gulf war in August 1988,
Kuwait deflagged six of the tankers.
   Surf City was one of the five still flying the U.S. flag, with
the Kuwaitis geared to discuss their de-registration this month.

<HEAD>Illinois Crude Oil Spill 16 Times Greater Than First Estimated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROXANA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shell Oil Co. said a pipeline accident this
week spilled an estimated 672,000 gallons of crude oil, 16 times
more than the company first estimated.
   The new figure stunned state environmental officials.
   ``This came as a tremendous shock,'' Will Flower, a spokesman
for the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, said Thursday.
``We knew the (42,000 gallon) figure was conservative, but to find
out that it was (672,000 gallons) was quite a shock.''
   An underground pipeline connecting two crude oil storage tanks
burst Monday, spewing crude oil above the ground near the tanks at
a Shell refinery across the Mississippi River from St. Louis.
   Shell spokesman Tony Canino defended the delay in reporting the
larger estimate, saying the company wanted to be ``absolutely
firm'' about any figures released.
   ``We think it's perfectly reasonable not to release a number
until it's firm,'' Canino said. ``We would rather be right than
fast.''
   Canino also said that Shell has not determined yet what caused
the underground pipeline to rupture in this southwestern Illinois
town.
   On Wednesday, the Illinois EPA called for a study of the
refinery to discover the cause of recurring spills, emissions and
fires, and come up with ways to prevent them.
   ``In pipeline leaks alone, there has been more than a million
gallons of product loss since mid-December,'' said Flower.
   The cleanup of the spill was continuing, Flower said, with
company crews picking up all liquid crude oil on the ground.
   ``In our last inspection, the oil didn't get into a nearby
retention pond, but the rain today moved the oil toward the
retention pond,'' said Flower.
   He said Shell deployed absorbent booms to collect oil in the
pond.
   State EPA officials and representatives from Illinois Attorney
General Neil Hartigan's office were scheduled to discuss the spill
with Shell officials this afternoon. Hartigan filed a lawsuit in
September against Shell, seeking $1.2 million in penalties for
various environmental mishaps.

   Nelson Mandela met today with
parliamentary opposition leaders, and aides released details of
what will be his first trip abroad since leaving prison _ an
18-day, four-nation trip starting next week.
   Aides also confirmed that Mandela, who has endorsed the
nationalization of South Africa's mines, planned to meet Monday
with the chairman of the country's largest mining conglomerate.
   Gavin Relly, whose Anglo American Corp. is the world's No. 1
gold producer, accepted an invitation to visit Mandela's house in
the black township of Soweto, the company said.
   In a demonstration of racial solidarity, hundreds of blacks
joined thousands of whites in a march and rally today organized by
the main white anti-apartheid party, the Democratic Party.
   Jackson Tembu, a black leader of the United Democratic Front
anti-apartheid coalition, joined Democratic Party co-leader Zach de
Beer on the podium at the rally and praised the party as ``the only
voice of reason'' in white politics in recent years.
   De Beer was one of three Democratic Party leaders to meet with
Mandela earlier today at his home. His party represents
anti-apartheid whites in Parliament. Also at the meeting was the
Reb. Allan Hendrickse, leader of Parliament's mixed-race chamber.
   Mandela's African National Congress has urged boycotts of
elections for the mixed-race and Asian chambers of Parliament,
saying their creation was part of an effort to entrench the
exclusion of blacks. But Hendrickse said after the meeting that the
ANC and the Labor Party, which controls the mixed-race chamber,
would be able to work together.
   Denis Worrall, one of the Democratic Party leaders, said his
delegation and Mandela agreed on the need for universal voting
rights, but differed over the ANC's support for guerrilla violence,
economic sanctions and nationalization.
   Since his release Feb. 11 after 27 years in prison, Mandela has
reaffirmed his support for the ANC's economic policies, which call
for nationalization of mines, banks and monopoly industries.
   Mandela, whose last trip abroad began with a clandestine border
crossing in 1962 shortly before his imprisonment, plans to fly
Tuesday to Lusaka, Zambia. There, he will meet leaders of several
African countries and confer with the ANC's exiled leadership.
   He then plans to spend three days in Zimbabwe and six days in
Tanzania before flying to Sweden on March 12 to visit ANC President
Oliver Tambo, who is recovering from a stroke in a Stockholm clinic.
   Relly has spoken out frequently against apartheid, and his
corporation _ although occasionally at odds with black unions over
wage disputes _ espouses relatively liberal employment policies.
   In 1985, when the government was condemning all contact with the
ANC, Relly was among a group of South African businessmen that
traveled to Lusaka for talks with the movement's leaders. Another
member of that delegation, Tony Bloom, also is scheduled to meet
Mandela on Monday.
   Bloom formerly was chairman of the Premier Corp., one of South
Africa's biggest food companies, but he left the country in 1988 to
work in London.
   Mandela and the ANC contend that some degree of socialism is
needed to help reduce the enormous gap between white wealth and
black poverty.
   Several business leaders have conceded that some redistribution
of wealth is needed but say this can be done better without
nationalization.

   Computerized selling and interest-rate jitters
pushed stock prices into a tailspin today, causing the fifth-worst
loss in history on the world's largest exchange.
   The fall comes two days after the Tokyo market's third-largest
decline and puts the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues down
2,569.35 points _ or nearly 7 percent _ for the week.
   The government acknowledged confusion over arbitrage trading and
today directed the securities industry to report on their arbitrage
activities, said a Finance Ministry official on condition of
anonymity.
   The Nikkei lost 935.87 points, or 2.61 percent, in light trading
to end the week at 34,890.97. It was the first time the Nikkei has
fallen below the 35,000-point level since Oct. 17, 1989.
   Meanwhile, the dollar rose against the Japanese yen, closing at
146.47 yen, up 1.24 yen from Thursday. The yen also lost ground
against other major currencies, including the West German mark.
   In Hong Kong, stock prices reacted to the drop in Tokyo, with
the Hang Seng Index losing 33.61 points to close at 2,894.31.
   Stocks in London also stumbled. By midday, the Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off 30.6 points, or 1.3
percent, at 2,238.6.
   The Nikkei index, which on Wednesday lost 1,161.19 points, or
more than 3 percent, won back 92.51 points on Thursday. But it
quickly began sliding when trading began today.
   Declines in the futures market triggered a wave of program
selling in the afternoon, pushing the Nikkei down to a four-month
low. Institutional investors, primarily foreign trust funds, sold a
large volume of index-related shares in the spot market through
program trading, analysts said.
   Securities and trust fund companies were hesitating to increase
their holdings for fear of reporting losses at the upcoming end of
the fiscal year, said Michio Katsumata of Nomura Securities Co.
Most Japanese companies close their annual accounts at the end of
March. Securities companies often cash in some of their holdings at
that time to offset earlier losses.
   Extremely thin volume accentuated the decline.
   ``The market is extremely vulnerable right now to such selling
because of the low volume of stocks being traded and small number
of investors taking part,'' Katsumata said. ``Most major players
remain on the sidelines.''
   Volume in the morning session was estimated at a low 430 million
shares, about half the usual amount.
   Dealers said anticipation that the Bank of Japan would hike the
discount contributed to the Nikkei's decline. Higher interest rates
tend to discourage stock investment.
   Officials at the central bank, whose official discount rate now
stands at 4.25 percent after three increases last year, have said
they are still monitoring economic conditions and have not decided
on another increase.
   Rising inflation in recent months and strong growth in the
economy and the money supply led analysts to predict a discount
rate increase.
   Rumors about the possible emergence of a stock scandal,
following last year's Recruit scandal, also discouraged many
investors, dealers said. One rumor suggested a major governing
party politician may be arrested for illegal stock dealings, they
said.

   Former President Reagan's videotaped testimony
gives little support to the defense in John M. Poindexter's
upcoming Iran-Contra trial and could undermine it in several
important ways, observers say.
   Reagan steadfastly maintained that Poindexter and other White
House aides were not breaking the law when they advised the
Nicaraguan Contras during a congressional ban on U.S. aid to the
rebels.
   The former president said he was in ``total agreement'' with a
letter Poindexter sent to Congress in July 1986 denying that the
National Security Council staff was giving the rebels covert
military assistance.
   ``If I had written it myself, I might have used a little
profanity,'' Reagan said of the letter, which prosecutors charge
was a false statement to lawmakers by Poindexter.
   Former Iran-Contra prosecutor Michael Bromwich said it the ``one
line that dramatically helps the defense'' during eight hours of
testimony.
   ``The president sees this letter and says it looks fine to
him,'' Bromwich said. ``I think it has a psychological effect on
the jury.''
   But Reagan's confusion and lack of knowledge about the
participation of Poindexter and White House aide Oliver L. North in
the Iran-Contra affair is damaging, said Bromwich, a member of the
team of lawyers that successfully prosecuted North last year.
   ``Reagan seems to have very little idea of what was going on so
he certainly didn't authorize or approve of what North or
Poindexter was doing based on full knowledge of the facts,'' said
Bromwich, now in private law practice in Washington.
   Also damaging are Reagan's statements that he didn't authorize
any of the actions Poindexter took that prosecutors allege violated
the law, Bromwich said.
   ``On the ultimate question, `Did you authorize? Did you
approve?' the answer is `No, No, No,''' Bromwich said.
   At the White House today, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We
have no comment'' on Reagan's testimony.
   The transcript of Reagan's eight-hour pre-trial deposition,
given last week behind closed doors in Los Angeles, was released
Thursday by U.S. District Judge Harold Greene.
   The public was allowed to view the videotapes of Reagan's
testimony in the courtroom where Poindexter is scheduled to go to
trial March 5 on charges of obstructing congressional inquiries
into the Iran-Contra affair.
   Reagan testified he ``never had any inkling'' that North was
providing strategic advice to the Contras.
   The former president steadfastly maintained that ``no one has
proven to me'' that profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales were
diverted to buy arms for the rebels.
   Nor did he know that North had sought help from arms dealers
Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord, a retired Air Force major
general, in arming the Contras. Both have pleaded guilty to charges
arising from their roles in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Only when prosecutor Dan Webb produced a copy of the report by
the Tower Commission, which Reagan appointed to investigate the
Iran-Contra affair, did the former president acknowledge that the
diversion must have occurred.
   ``This is the first time that I have ever seen a reference that
actually specified there was a diversion,'' Reagan told Webb.
   Asked if he expected Poindexter to report the diversion to the
president, Reagan said: ``Yes, unless maybe he thought he was
protecting me.''
   In fact, Poindexter told Congress in 1987 that he didn't tell
Reagan about the diversion.
   Reagan admitted to Webb that he never authorized his former
national security adviser to obstruct congressional inquiries into
the Iran-Contra affair by destroying documents or making false
statements.
   This testimony ``takes away one of the defenses that Admiral
Poindexter was asserting,'' said Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., who was
a recipient of one of Poindexter's letters when he chaired the
House Intelligence Committee.
   ``That defense was that he was specifically authorized to do
what he did,'' Hamilton said.
   Paul Rothstein, a Georgetown University law professor, said Webb
may have ``made a lot of mileage'' by getting Reagan to say he
didn't authorize the specific acts by Poindexter that prosecutors
say violated the law.
   The defense probably will focus on the claim that Reagan's
fervent support for the Contras ``created a certain environment or
climate in the White House that gave the signal or the impression
to Admiral Poindexter that he could do what he did,'' Hamilton said.
   Reagan's testimony may give some support here because the former
president was so firm in his criticism of Congress for tying his
hands when he was trying to help the Contras, Bromwich said.
   ``There is throughout this deposition, a clear suspicion of
Congress that comes out loud and clear,'' Bromwich said.
   The former president's testimony also makes clear that ``Reagan
viewed himself in a war with Congress on Contra aid,'' Bromwich
said. ``He made very clear to all his subordinates that he felt
very strongly on the issue.''
   But Webb used written answers that Reagan gave to the
Iran-Contra grand jury in 1987 ``to cut his legs out from under
him'' when his testimony conflicted with the prior statements,
Bromwich noted.
   Reagan testified that he didn't know which White House official
told him that a C-123 transport plane that was shot down over
Nicaraguan on Oct. 5, 1986, was not connected with any U.S.
government effort to help the Contras.
   But Webb produced Reagan's written answers in which he
specifically stated that it was Poindexter who gave him those
assurances.

   Czechoslovak president Vaclav Havel dashed
around Manhattan, receiving a hero's welcome from writers and
artists, hobnobbing with punk rockers and meeting a ``legend'' _
Paul Newman.
   ``I've been in the presence of some great artists and I've been
in the presence of some great statesmen, but I've never before been
in the presence of a great artist-statesman,'' Newman said Thursday
at a reception for Havel.
   With the wit and self-deprecation that typified the comments he
made in broken English in his one-day whirl around the city, Havel
called Newman ``such a big legend that I didn't believe he
physically exists. Now I'm standing here with him.''
   The Czechoslovak Parliament elected Havel president a few weeks
after a peaceful revolution in December that led to the ouster of a
hard-line Communist government. That regime had jailed Havel for
five years for his satirical plays and other activism.
   After receiving the Spirit of Freedom award from the Cathedral
of St. John the Divine on Thursday, Havel told an audience of
several thousand:
   ``I'm sorry I had no opportunity to write my speech because I
was not today two hours in prison.'' Some of Havel's works were
produced in the solitude of incarceration.
   Havel's caretaker government is preparing for parliamentary
elections in June. He left for home early this morning, and arrived
in Czechoslovakia later in the day, the Czechoslovak state news
agency reported.
   His first taste of the Big Apple in a generation began late
Wednesday in lower Manhattan's East Village. His boyhood
schoolmate, filmmaker Milos Forman, took him on walks to places
Havel visited in 1968.
   They dropped in on CBGBs, one of the first punk rock clubs, and
rock hangout The Bitter End.
   ``People were recognizing him in the streets,'' Forman said.
``Their faces were lighting up.''
   At a concert in Havel's honor Thursday, playwright Arthur Miller
said, ``I welcome him as the world's first avant-garde president.''
   Among the other artists who spoke at the concert at the
Cathedral of St. John the Divine was actor Ron Silver, who said:
``Vaclav Havel has shown the world that art matters.''
   Addressing Havel, he added: ``Help us overcome our cynicism and
let us bask in the glory and joy of an artist leading us.''
   Earlier Havel received an honorary doctor of law degree from
Columbia University, where Forman teaches film.
   Columbia President Michael Sovern told the playwright: ``We are
especially pleased to award you a degree because as a young man you
and many other promising leaders of your generation were
deliberately prevented from earning one by the oppressive regime.''
   Havel breakfasted with Mayor David Dinkins and theater producer
Joseph Papp, who announced his intention to produce Havel's play
``Slum Clearance.''
   Papp had invited Havel to New York in 1968 with an invitation to
see the Public Theater's production of his play, ``The Memorandum.''
   Havel told reporters Thursday that as a playwright, he never
could have conceived a plot in which he would become president.
   Like many tourists, Havel's agenda included the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, where he viewed 20th-century works.
   Havel also met with U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar.
   The concert at the cathedral featured performances by Paul
Simon, James Taylor, Roberta Flack, opera star Placido Domingo, and
the Brooklyn Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Zubin Mehta.
   Classical offerings included selections from Czech composer
Antonin Dvorak's ``New World Symphony'' and Mozart's ``Don
Giovanni,'' which premiered in Prague.
   A dozen actors and writers _ including Gregory Peck and Saul
Bellow _ read from Havel's speeches and letters and paid tribute to
his achievements.
   Forman, the filmmaker, summed up their sentiments by saying:
``If a playwright makes us laugh or cry, ... he's an artist. But if
a playwright succeeds to orchestrate the overthrow of a communist
dictatorship without one bullet fired, it's a miracle.''
   On Wednesday, Havel addressed Congress in Washington, D.C., and
said the United States could best help Czechoslovakia by helping
the Soviet Union stay on the road to democracy.

   NASA today postponed for a third
time the flight of Atlantis on a secret military mission, saying
its commander had recovered from an illness but the threat of
storms still prevented the launch.
   NASA managers ordered the delay until at least Sunday, blaming a
weather front that moved into the area this morning, packing rain
and brisk winds and bringing the threat of thunderstorms. The
forecast for Sunday is much better with an 80 percent chance of
favorable conditions.
   The postponement came just hours after doctors pronounced
Atlantis commander John O. Creighton fully recovered from a
respiratory infection that, along with the weather, forced two
earlier postponements.
   NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham said today that after doctors
decided Creighton was healthy enough to fly Atlantis, the astronaut
and a crewmate spent part of the morning flying practice landings
in the space shuttle training aircraft.
   Atlantis originally was scheduled for launch early Thursday, but
Creighton became ill. Hopes of launching this morning instead were
dashed when physicians recommended Creighton be given another 24
hours to recover. That slipped the launch to early Saturday, and
then the weather forecast today put it back another 24 hours.
   Sources said Atlantis will deploy a spy satellite during a
four-day mission.
   Creighton's illness, described formally as an infection of the
upper respiratory tract, developed suddenly on Wednesday. He
received unspecified therapy and by Thursday afternoon NASA said he
was on the mend.
   Because of the military secrecy of Atlantis' flight, NASA has
not announced a precise launch time, saying only that it would come
between midnight and 4 a.m. The countdown is kept secret until the
final nine minutes before the rockets ignite.
   Once Atlantis fades from the view of launch observers, progress
of the mission will be blacked out. NASA will not release the
air-to-ground communications, as is done with most shuttle flights,
or give reports on the astronaut activities.
   The blackout will be lifted just an hour before Atlantis returns
to Earth for a landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
   Creighton's illness came as a surprise. All five of Atlantis'
crew members were found to be healthy during a routine medical
examination on Tuesday. The next day, the astronaut complained of a
sore throat.
   NASA doctors enforce a strict isolation for the astronauts seven
days before a launch. The system requires most people working
within six feet of the astronauts to wear masks.
   A NASA spokesman claimed on Wednesday that an astronaut illness
had never before forced a mission postponement. But, after a bit of
file-checking on Thursday, the agency said that the Apollo 9 flight
in 1969 had been delayed three days because the crewmen developed
upper respiratory infections.
   In 1970, astronaut Thomas K. Mattingly was taken off the crew of
Apollo 13 doctors learned he had been exposed to the measles. He
was replaced on the crew by back-up pilot John Swigert and the
launch was not delayed.
   NASA officials said there were no plans to replace Creighton.
   Creighton's four crewmates on Atlantis are Air Force Capt. John
H. Casper, Marine Lt. Col. David C. Hilmers, Air Force Col. Richard
M. Mullane, and Navy Lt. Cmdr. Pierre J. Thuot.
   Atlantis, according to sources who asked not to be named, is to
carry into space a 37,300-pound, $500 million spy satellite called
AFP-731. The device is said to be capable of taking high-resolution
reconnaissance photos and of eavesdropping on electronic
communications around the world.
   The satellite is to be placed into a high inclination orbit that
will cover more of the Earth than satellites previously launched by
the shuttle. This orbital path will carry it over most of the
Soviet Union, including areas far to the north.
   Atlantis' flight will be 34th space shuttle mission and the
sixth secret military mission.

<HEAD>Nation's Traffic Fatality Rate Lowest Ever in 1989</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts new 9th graf, The highest, with highest-ever fatality
rate.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The 1980s ended with the lowest annual traffic
death rate ever, capping a decade in which many Americans declared
war on drunken driving and began using long-neglected safety belts,
federal officials say.
   The 1989 fatality rate was 2.2 deaths per 100 million miles
traveled, down from 2.3 the previous year and one-third lower than
the 1980 rate of 3.3, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration reported.
   Fatalities in 1989 are estimated at 45,500, compared with 47,093
in 1988. Final numbers for last year are still being tallied but
are unlikely to change significantly, officials said.
   ``The reduction in traffic deaths during the 1980s reflects our
national resolve against drunk driving, increased safety belt use
and a generally heightened awareness of highway safety,''
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said Thursday.
   The death rate probably will continue downward in the 1990s,
even if more miles are driven, as the government expands safety
regulations and the automobile industry makes vehicles more
crashworthy, officials said.
   ``This means that American motorists are less at risk than ever
before,'' NHTSA administrator Jerry R. Curry said.
   The fatality rate is the most widely accepted measure of highway
safety trends, Curry said. It takes into account changes in miles
driven from year to year, and even a slight increase or decrease
can reflect a difference of thousands of lives.
   If last year's rate were the same as in 1980, for example, the
number of deaths would have been 69,800 instead of 45,500.
   The highest fatality rate on record is 24.1 deaths per 100
million miles in 1921, the first year the government attempted to
establish a rate, NHTSA spokesman Tim Hurd said. By 1940, when
statistics were more reliable, the rate had fallen to 10.9 deaths
per 100 million miles, still far higher than recent years.
   Joan Claybrook, NHTSA administrator during the Carter
administration who criticized the agency's performance in the
Reagan years, also hailed the improved fatality rate. But it
resulted in part from standards the federal government adopted
grudgingly, she said.
   ``Even when Reagan was saying get the government off our backs,
state legislatures were continuing to pass these safety
requirements with these incredibly high payoffs,'' said Ms.
Claybrook, now president of Public Citizen, a public interest group
founded by Ralph Nader.
   Thirty-three states and the District of Columbia have enacted
mandatory seat belt laws since 1984. The total fell from 34 last
fall when North Dakota voters rejected by referendum a bill that
had cleared the state legislature.
   Seat belt use has increased from 10 to 15 percent in the early
1980s to around 47 percent, said Jeffrey Miller, deputy NHTSA
administrator.
   A regulation that took effect in September requires all cars
made in the United States to have air bags or automatic safety
belts.
   ``That will save thousands of lives every year,'' Ms. Claybrook
said. ``It's the most important health standard in America.''
   Meanwhile, all states now require child restraint seats and have
established 21 as the minimum drinking age. Alcohol-related highway
deaths have fallen from about 28,000 in 1980 to 23,500 in 1988, a
17 percent decline. The number of teen-agers involved in such
crashes fell by one-third between 1982 and 1986, Miller said.
   ``The numbers are still obviously high but we're making some
noticeable inroads,'' he said.
   State drunken driving laws were toughened across the nation
during the 1980s, while police and prosecutors became more adept at
handling impaired driving cases, Miller said. Public tolerance
waned, spawning designated driver programs and awareness campaigns.
   Curry, appointed by President Bush last year, has promised to
quicken his agency's consideration of new safety regulations. He
said Thursday that new side-impact standards, the subject of fierce
debate for more than a decade, will be established this year.
   ``There's a lot of emotion involved ... a lot of money involved
for the manufacturers,'' he said. ``It's going to be expensive.''
   The new standards will envision a 10 to 15 percent reduction in
side-impact deaths, which total one-third of all fatalities in
passenger cars, said Barry Felrice, associate NHTSA administrator
for rulemaking.
   But Curry voiced concern about overburdening automakers, with
tough clean air and gas mileage requirements pending in Congress.
   ``The automobile industry is fragile and we have dumped an awful
lot of safety regulations on them in the last 12 months,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   An unmanned Ariane rocket carrying
two Japanese communications satellites exploded just after liftoff,
prompting the competitor to the U.S. commercial launch industry to
suspend future flights.
   The Ariane 44-L rocket, powered by four strap-on boosters, blew
apart Thursday less than two minutes after takeoff, apparently
because of a fire in the propulsion system, Arianespace President
Frederic D'Allest said at the launch site late Thursday.
   ``All Ariane flights are suspended until we discover the reasons
of this accident,'' he said. ``We are going to analyze this failure
and explain the catastrophe of this flight as rapidly as possible.''
   The Ariane rocket, carrying two telecommunications satellites
for the Japan Broadcasting Corp. and Space Communications Corp.,
exploded over the Atlantic Ocean about 7{ miles from the launch pad
at the Ariane space center in Kourou, French Guiana, on the
northeast coast of South America.
   It was the first such failure after 17 consecutive successful
Ariane launches.
   One of the boosters powering the 582-ton vehicle experienced a
sudden drop of pressure just 6.2 seconds after the end of the
countdown, Arianespace officials said. Two other boosters tried to
prevent the rocket from tipping but were unable to stabilize the
flight.
   At 90 seconds, technicians realized the mission would have to be
abandoned, and the explosion took place 11 seconds later, officials
said.
   Arianespace had planned at least eight more launches this year,
but all have been suspended until the fault can be discovered and
fixed, D'Allest said. In the meantime, Arianespace will continue to
manufacture and prepare rockets to be ready to resume launches.
   Speaking to reporters today, D'Allest said Arianespace was eager
to reassure customers of its reliability and would establish a
special investigative panel next week to determine the reason for
the rocket's failure. Customers will be given all the details of
the findings ``so they can ... be comfortable that we can resume
flights safely,'' he said.
   Japanese officials said they would continue to cooperate with
Arianespace, despite the loss of the two satellites that were
insured for more than $200 million.
   Witnesses who saw the flight on the video monitors at launch
headquarters in Evry, France, said flames appeared to break out in
the first stage of the rocket before it was due to detach at 2
minutes, 30 seconds into flight.
   Technicians said the rocket appeared slightly off course and
passed unexpectedly close above the support scaffolding as it rose,
with flame from one of the boosters burning the structure.
   However, there was no indication this caused the explosion.
Technicians who replayed videotapes Thursday night suggested a
turbo-pump failure might have contributed to the blast.
   Debris from the vehicle rained over the coast, but no injuries
were reported.
   Winds carried a cloud of the fuel back to land, forcing the
launch staff and the 12,000 residents of Kourou indoors until it
passed. Some residents complained of burning eyes and sore throats.
   French police and soldiers, using a helicopter, searched today
for debris along the coast.
   Arianespace, a consortium of European companies, took over the
commercialization of the Ariane program from the European Space
Agency in 1980. It is responsible for building, operating and
marketing launch services.
   Ariane shots have become routine, with successful missions about
once a month. The reliability of the program has made Arianespace
the world's leading provider of commercial launch services.
   Four other Ariane rockets have exploded in flight. Thursday's
was the first explosion since May 31, 1986, and the first of the
No. 4 rocket series. The 44-L is the most powerful in the series.
   The launch was the 36th Ariane mission since the first flight in
the unmanned space program, overseen by the European Space Agency,
was held Dec. 24, 1979.
   The United States depended on its space shuttles to launch
commercial satellites until the Challenger exploded on Jan. 28,
1986. Since then, three major American aerospace companies, Martin
Marietta, McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics, have been
developing and launching commerical satellites.
   But with its early start, Ariane has captured about 50 percent
of the market, and it drew business from the American program after
the Challenger explosion.
   For Thursday's launch, the BS-2X satellite was built by General
Electric's aerospace division to direct broadcasting for Japan's
national NHK television network.
   In Tokyo, Yoshiro Nakamura, chief technician for the network,
said the failure was very disappointing but NHK's staff would
continue to cooperate with Arianespace.
   The second satellite, the Superbird B built by Ford Aerospace,
was owned by Mitsubishi's subsidiary, Space Communications Corp.
   The BS-2X was insured for $150 million to $180 million,
Arianespace said, while the Superbird B was insured for about $60
million.
   Jungi Inoue of the Space Communications Corp. put launch and
insurance costs at $600 million.

   Cambodian government forces today
retook a strategic northwestern town from guerrillas in the first
major victory of the Communist government's counteroffensive.
   The outcome of the battle was reported by a guerrilla commander,
Gen. Dien Del, and confirmed by the radio of Cambodia's
Vietnamese-installed government.
   Dien Del, deputy commander of the non-Communist Khmer People's
National Liberation Front guerrillas, charged that Vietnamese
soldiers were involved in the attack, although Vietnam claimed it
withdrew all its troops in September. Captured soldiers told of 700
Vietnamese at two bases near Svay Chek.
   The New York Times today quoted Eastern European diplomats as
saying several thousand Vietnamese troops and military advisers
returned to Cambodia in October to help government troops defend
Battambang and Sisophon, two important cities.
   It quoted the diplomats, who were not identified, as saying
about 5,000 Vietnamese soldiers were still in Cambodia.
   Cambodia's official radio said government troops ``succeeded in
completely recapturing Svay Chek. We are now in full control of
this area.''
   The fighting came three days before peace talks are to begin in
Indonesia between the Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom Penh
and the three guerrilla groups led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   The guerrillas have made major gains in the west bordering
Thailand since September. The Sihahouk guerrillas seized the
strategic town of Thmar Puok, while the Khmer Rouge guerrillas took
the gem-mining town of Pailin.
   The fighting had been at a relative lull in more recent weeks.
In the past, it has intensified just before peace talks as the
government and guerrillas try to strengthen their bargaining
positions.
   Dien Del, interviewed in the key Thai border town of
Aranyaprathet, said Svay Chek was heavily shelled by tanks and
Soviet-made, multiple-rocket launchers during the final assault,
four days after the counteroffensive began.
   He said the 600 guerrillas defending the town fled in confusion
after they failed to receive word that a front-line position had
fallen earlier. They regrouped in three towns north of Svay Chek,
he said.
   The general had no reports on casualties.
   The liberation front had taken Svay Chek Dec. 5 after three
major assaults.
   The guerrillas' brief control of Svay Chek allowed them to
attack Sisophon, a government military operations center 13 miles
to the south. Svay Chek is near the Thai border and in the province
of Banteay Meanchey.
   The guerrillas will not immediately try to retake Svay Chek
because of shortages of Chinese-supplied ammunition, Dien Del said.
   Guerrilla sources also reported that Chinese-supported Khmer
Rouge guerrillas on Thursday night attacked a major government
military garrison at Sophy, which is south of Svay Chek. Details
were not immediately available.
   The Khmer Rouge, another member of Sihanouk's coalition, were in
power in Cambodia in 1975-1978. During that time, hundreds of
thousands of Cambodia's 8 million people died from Khmer Rouge
executions, famine and civil unrest.

   President Bush's press secretary gave a
light-hearted tongue-lashing today to the nation's lawyers, saying
they ``deserve all the criticism they can get.''
   Marlin Fitzwater made his comment at his regular daily briefing
when a reporter asked when Bush felt that lawyers were guilty of
seeking excessive awards in malpractice cases. Bush, in a speech
Thursday, had said the government would help ``restore common sense
and fairness to America's medical malpractice system.''
   Fitzwater, who is not a lawyer, said, ``Lawyers certainly
deserve all the criticism they can get.''
   Asked if Bush, also a non-lawyer, shared his feelings, Fitzwater
laughingly said: ``Those are universally held feelings by everyone
who's ever dealt with the legal establishment ... I'm sure all my
good friends who are lawyers understand.''
   Fitzwater, who is divorced and recently closed on a new house,
did not explain the basis of his feelings.

<TEXT>
   Two bombs caused minor damage
today at a U.S. bank and a meatpacking company owned by a
multinational corporation. A leftist group claimed responsibility.
   Elsewhere, police stepped up security outside supermarkets in
several provinces after looting occurred, apparently by people
outraged over the nation's economic problems and unemployment.
   The early morning blast at Citibank damaged the entrance to the
building in Lomas de Zamora, 12 miles southwest of the capital.
Windows and storefronts in neighboring buildings were shattered,
police said.
   The blast at Tres Cruces meatpacking company occurred in Villa
Devoto, a residential neighborhood in Buenos Aires, and caused
similar damage. The company is owned by the Brazil-based Bunge y
Borne group, one of Latin America's largest multinationals.
   There were no reports of injuries in either blast.
   A leftist group called the Che Guevara Brigade claimed
responsibility. In a communique left at an independent news agency,
the group said:
   ``We cannot stand by, arms crossed, to the rape by monopolies.
Citibank and the meatpacker Tres Cruces were struck this morning
... because (the brigade) considers them responsible ... for
aggression against the people.''
   In Santa Fe, 300 miles north of the capital, about 50 people
ransacked a grocery. Police Chief Carmelo Rolon told the government
news agency Telam that a dozen false alarms about trouble eslewhere
in the city were called in beforehand to disperse his forces.
   Twenty people were arrested, including six children and four
women, Telam reported, and quick police action stopped another
attempting looting nearby.
   In a separate incident, 50 people looted a food store in San
Miguel de Tucuman, capital of the province, the news agency Diarios
y Noticias reported.
   In Rosario, the biggest city in Santa Fe province, several
stores and delivery trucks were looted Wednesday and Thursday,
prompting patrols by provincial and federal police, and
paramilitary border guards.
   Rosario, a city of 1 million located 185 miles north of Buenos
Aires, was the center of food riots in May in which at least 16
people died, nearly 200 were injured and more than 1,700 arrested.
   A provincial governor, Pedro Salvatori, told Telam today the
situation in his area ``is very alarming....There is a (economic)
paralysis, high unemployment and hyperinflation.''
   Police patrols of supermarkets in Resistencia, the capital of
norther Chaco Province, were stepped up today.
   The national government insists the looting is isolated and
caused by leftist agitators. President Carlos Menem today called
such agitators ``individuals who live in an atmosphere of
violence.''
   The Che Guevara Brigade communique exhorted Argentines to ``sack
... supermarkets, defend ... state companies, resist hunger-level
salaries and unemployment and the closing of factories.''
   Since Menem took office in July he has imposed three steep hikes
in public service rates and pledged to sell state companies and cut
public spending in an effort to narrow a huge deficit and curtail
inflation.
   Unemployment is running about 20 percent, and inflation has
soared 8,124 percent during the past 12 months.

<TEXT>
   Singer Johnnie Ray, whose string of hits in
the early 1950s served as a precursor to rock 'n' roll, was in
critical condition in a coma today after suffering liver failure, a
hospital spokesman said.
   Ray, 63, was not expected to live, according to a statement
issued late Thursday by Alan Eichler Associates, a public relations
firm.
   Ron Wise, spokesman at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said he did
not know know what caused Ray's liver failure or when he was
admitted.
   Ray's first major record release, ``Cry,'' with ``The Little
White Cloud That Cried'' on the flip side provided him the No. 1
and No. 2 songs in the country in 1950.
   His emotional singing style, punctuated with real-sounding sobs,
were the subject of jokes and skits by impersonators.
   With the release of his follow-up record, ``Please Mr. Sun'' and
``Brokenhearted,'' Ray's songs occupied the top four positions in
the charts kept by the entertainment newspaper Variety, a feat
listed in the Guinness Book of Records, the Eichler release said.
   Ray's songs blended rhythm and blues, country and gospel,
helping to create rock 'n' roll.
   Other top songs included ``What's the Use,'' ``Somebody Stole My
Gal,'' ``Who's Sorry Now,'' and ``Yes Tonight Josephine.''
   In 1954, he co-starred with Ethel Merman, Dan Dailey, Marilyn
Monroe, Donald O'Connor and Mitzi Gaynor in ``There's No Business
Like Show Business.''

   Fire broke out in a senior citizens' high-rise
building early today, killing a man and a woman who leapt to her
death from the burning 11th floor apartment, officials said.
   The blaze was quickly extinguished by firefighters from a
next-door fire station who were alerted by people yelling.
   Deputy Fire Chief D.M. Chamberlin Sr. said a man was found dead
in the apartment where the fire started, and a woman was killed
when she jumped from the burning apartment.
   Fire department officials identified the victims as James
Loughridge, 58, who lived in the apartment, and 28-year-old
Patricia Almond of Atlanta, who was visiting him.
   Four residents taken to Grady Memorial Hospital for treatment of
smoke inhalation and minor lacerations, said spokesman Jim
Driscoll. None was expected to be admitted, he said.
   Chamberlin said about 60 residents were evacuated from the
13-story Juniper-Tenth high-rise. The cause of the blaze was not
immediatly known. An arson inspector was on the scene, which
Chamberlin said was routine for fatal fires.
   Firefighters heard people yelling shortly after 1 a.m.,
Chamberlin said. He did not know if the shouts came from people in
the building or on the street.
   While firefighters battled the fire, others knocked on doors to
awaken sleeping residents and direct them to safety. The fire
spread to adjacent apartments on the 11th floor, Chamberlin said.
   The Atlanta Housing Authority apartment building for the elderly
is located in Atlanta's Midtown section.

<TEXT>
   The former justice minister who was
forced to resign amid allegations she disclosed secret government
information to her husband was cleared of wrongdoing today.
   A Supreme Court jury said evidence did not support prosecution
claims that Elisabeth Kopp violated official secrecy laws, a crime
punishable by up to three years in prison. But the court said Mrs.
Kopp had lacked ``the required care.''
   The five-member court convicted Kopp's former personal assistant
but imposed no penalty. It acquitted another former Justice
Ministry aide.
   The case involved a government investigation in 1988 into
laundering of drug money and its scrutiny of the currency dealing
firm Shakarchi Trading A.G.
   Mrs. Kopp's husband, Hans. W. Kopp, resigned as vice president
of the firm Oct. 27, 1988, the day he received a phone call from
his wife urging him to break ties with the company.
   No charges have been filed against Shakarchi, and the company
denies wrongdoing.
   Several dozen supporters cheered when Mrs. Kopp, smiling
broadly, left the Supreme Court building in Lausanne today.
   Mrs. Kopp admitted in court that she made the phone call to her
husband, a businessman and lawyer, but said she thought the
information she gave to him had come from banking circles, not from
government secrets.
   Mrs. Kopp's personal assistant at the time was Katharina Schoop,
who told her boss of the probe involving Shakarchi. Ms. Schoop said
she learned of it from Justice Department documents shown to her by
another ministry aide, Renate Schwob.
   Ms. Schoop said that when she told Mrs. Kopp her husband's firm
was under suspicion, the source of information was never mentioned
but that she was convinced Mrs. Kopp knew it came from inside the
government.
   After Mrs. Kopp called her husband, she told him to call Ms.
Schoop for more information.
   The court convicted Ms. Schoop of giving details to Mr. Kopp but
did not impose a penalty, saying Ms. Schoop was acting on her
bosses' orders and was not aware she was breaking the law.
   Ms. Schwob was acquitted.
   All had been charged with violating official secrecy laws, an
offense carrying a maximum three-year prison term and fines of up
to $27,000.
   Mrs. Kopp was Switzerland's only female government minister and
was in line to be the country's first woman president, a largely
ceremonial post. She resigned over the affair in January 1989.

   A convicted murder was taken to a funeral home
today to pay respects to his mother after the state correction
commissioner set aside a state law adopted in reponse to the Willie
Horton case.
   The decision Thursday is the first time an inmate serving a life
sentence for first-degree murder has been granted a non-medical
emergency furlough since Massachusetts adopted the statute.
   The law was approved after Horton, a convicted murder, fled
while on furlough from Massachusetts and assaulted a Maryland
couple. President Bush used the issue in his campaign in 1988
against Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.
   The state statute prohibits emergency furloughs, except for
medical reasons, to inmates serving life sentences for first-degree
murder.
   Following a series of court decisions, Correction Commissioner
George Vose agreed to allow Philip Pennellatore to be taken under
guard for a private viewing of his mother, Nettie Pennellatore,
before today's funeral. Pennelatore made the visit at about 7 a.m.
   Mrs. Pennellatore died Tuesday of pancreatic cancer. She was 61.
   Her son, 29, was convicted of first-degree murder for the 1981
killing of an 80-year-old retired librarian and is serving a life
sentence.
   John Reinstein, legal director of the American Civil Liberties
Union in Boston, said Pennellatore was pleased with the decision
but added, ``He wishes this issue had been resolved before she died
so he could have seen her.''
   The ACLU had sought a court injunction to permit Pennellatore to
visit his mother Feb. 5, but she died before a ruling was made.
   Pennellatore then requested permission to attend the funeral,
but a Superior Court judge ruled against it Wednesday.
   Vose granted the emergency furlough after a state appeals court
judge ordered the Correction Department to consider the request,
said department spokeswoman Kathy Robertson.

<HEAD>Baker Outlines Terms for Normal Ties With Sandinistas</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III says he
will impose stiff conditions on normalizing relations with
Nicaragua even if the leftist government is returned to power on
Sunday in a free and fair election.
   Baker ruled out normal ties on Thursday unless Nicaragua
refrains for a ``sustained period'' after the election from
supporting leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   In addition, he said, the administration must be satisfied that
the Sandinista government will not shut down the democratic opening
which President Daniel Ortega has given to opposition groups during
the campaign.
   Asked about U.S. policy during a hearing of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, Baker said it is normal for those who believe in
democracy to respect the results of a free and fair election.
   But, he said, the U.S. government will make its own judgment
about the fairness of the election, suggesting that he will not
take at face value the assessments of the hundreds of international
observers who will be in Nicaragua on Sunday.
   The administration has provided assistance to opposition
candidate Violeta Chamorro in her campaign to end Ortega's 10{-year
grip on power.
   A consensus has emerged among State Department officials that
Mrs. Chamorro has the votes to defeat Ortega but that the
Sandinistas will devise a way to rig the outcome in their favor.
   At the White House today, Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., and Allen
Weinstein, president of the Center For Democracy independent
monitoring organization, also cited a possibility for fraud in the
Nicaraguan election.
   The two, who met with Vice President Dan Quayle, said the
Nicaraguan system of taking vote counts off official tally sheets
and relaying them by Telex to Managua leaves open opportunities for
meddling with the results out of the view of official observers.
   ``The chain of observation has been broken,'' said Lugar.
   Weinstein also said that delegations from Costa Rica and
Honduras were told they could not join his observer group.
   Lugar said President Bush should ``go slow'' in improving ties
should Ortega win the election, until it can be determined if the
process was fairly conducted.
   In discussing the possibility of a Sandinista victory, Baker
said Thursday, ``I don't think we should assume this at all.''
   Most recent polls show Ortega with a comfortable lead but
officials here believe that many Nicaraguans, fearing retaliation,
are not inclined to be honest with pollsters.
   The administration has highlighted perceived campaign abuses by
the Sandinistas, but former President Jimmy Carter has described
most such complaints as ``highly exaggerated.''
   Carter heads the observer delegation of the Council of Freely
Elected Heads of Government, which has made a number of trips to
Nicaragua.
   Although U.S. military aid to the Contra rebels was suspended
two years ago, U.S.-Nicaraguan relations are far from normal. A
trade embargo imposed by the United States in 1985 remains in
effect and the respective embassies of the two countries have not
been represented at the level of ambassador since 1988.
   It is assumed that if Mrs. Chamorro wins on Sunday, the
thousands of Contra rebels now assembled at border camps in
Honduras will return to Nicaragua in peace.
   The fate of the Contras in the event of a Sandinista victory is
less clear. U.S. officials, without being specific, have told
Contra leaders that the United States will not abandon them
regardless of the outcome Sunday. A $49.5 million U.S. humanitarian
aid program expires at the end of the month.
   The level of suspicion between the United States and Nicaragua
remains high. The Sandinistas reject Washington's assertion that
U.S. aid to the Contras is limited to food and other humanitarian
items, charging that U.S. logistical support is being provided as
well. Although an informal cease-fire was suspended late last year,
the fighting has been no more than sporadic.
   The Bush administration has its own list of grievances against
the Sandinistas. Chief among them is the administration contention
that Nicaragua continues to arm and train the Salvadoran rebels in
violation of a pledge Ortega has made in writing to other Central
American presidents.
   Nicaragua also maintains close ties with Cuba, reinforcing U.S.
concerns that the Sandinistas are intent on exporting their
revolution.

<TEXT>
   Tycoon Donald Trump, who usually delights in
media attention, says he hates the splashy publicity about his
breakup with wife Ivana but believes it has a silver lining: It's
good for business.
   Trump said in an interview Thursday that the screaming tabloid
headlines and talk-show jokes about his marital travails actually
have benefitted his multibillion-dollar casino, hotel and airline
empire.
   ``The business has never been better,'' he said, ``but because
it's a private company most people don't know about it.
Unfortunately, for all the wrong reasons, the last two weeks it's
been even better yet.''
   Trump said business has been up at his two hotel-casinos in
Atlantic City, N.J., the Plaza Hotel and the Trump Shuttle, which
links New York with Washington and Boston, since the breakup first
hit the headlines two weeks ago.
   Still, he said having his name splashed over the media has taken
a toll.
   ``It's horrible. I hate it. I hate the publicity,'' Trump said
in his glitzy 26th-floor office commanding a view of Central Park
and the Plaza Hotel, one of his properties.
   ``It's been on a personal basis difficult because I happen to
like Ivana. ... But it's something you have to go through and in
many cases a lot of people have to go through it. People grow
apart.''
   Under an agreement Ivana is contesting, she would receive $25
million and the couple's home in Connecticut as well as custody of
their children. Trump's holdings are estimated to be worth up to $4
billion.
   Although Trump insisted the publicity was a business plus, some
marketing analysts said the headlines could hurt an empire built
the developer's name.
   ``He's becoming a joke,'' said Jack Trout, president of Trout &amp;
Ries, a marketing consulting firm in Greenwich, Conn.
   Mrs. Trump declined through spokesman John Scanlon to comment on
her husband's remarks.
   ``All Mrs. Trump wants is a fair and equitable share of the
fortune that they accumulated together while they were married,''
Scanlon said. ``We're disappointed that Mr. Trump is prepared to
offer his wife and children less than 1 percent of his accumulated
wealth. We really expected better of him.''
   The Daily News in New York reported today that Mrs. Trump's
friends said she was seeing an analyst ``several times a week'' in
an effort ``to keep a grip on her emotions and help her through the
rough spots.'' The newspaper did not identify the friends, nor did
the report indicate whether Mrs. Trump had ever consulted an
analyst before the breakup.
   On Thursday, meanwhile, Trump accepted the ``Outstanding New
Yorker Award'' from the New York Society of Association Executives.
   He appeared unflustered by the media's microscope until city
Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman praised his achievements and listed
those which have brought him and New York acclaim.
   ``And to me one of the most important things is his love
affair,'' she said, pausing several seconds while she knocked on
the wooden podium. Then she added ``with the city.''
   There was laughter throughout the crowd and then Trump's face
became red for at least a full minute.

<TEXT>
   A store clerk has shot and killed a
robbery suspect for the second time in seven months, this time an
unarmed man who had his hands in his pocket as if he had a weapon,
police say.
   Du ``Jack'' Nguyen, 28, told police that the suspect, Frederick
B. Henderson, demanded money after entering the Happy 7 Food Mart
on Thursday, saying, ``You want to do this the hard way or the easy
way?''
   Nguyen said he handed over an undisclosed amount of money, then
pulled out a 9mm handgun and told Henderson to freeze, said police
investigator Dennis Waldron. Nguyen said he fired one shot when the
suspect turned with his hands in his pockets.
   Although Henderson never threatened the clerk, Nguyen said he
believed his life was in danger, Waldron said.
   Last July 19, Nguyen shot and killed Calvin Lee Watts, 29, who
entered the store with a pistol and demanded money, investigators
said.
   Waldron said the state attorney's office will be asked to
investigate the latest shooting.
   ``It appears at this point that (the shooting) is well within
the law, but the investigation is ongoing,'' he said. ``The law
says you can use whatever force is reasonable for protection of
yourself or others if someone threatens to harm you.''
   It marked the fourth time that shots have been fired at the
convenience store in Pensacola's middle-class East Hill district in
the last 18 months.
   Other clerks fired shots at robbery suspects twice in 1988, but
no one was wounded in either case.

<HEAD>Parts of Alabama, Georgia Declared Disasters</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Waterlogged portions of Georgia and Alabama were declared
federal disaster areas today and residents of low-lying sections in
Mississippi stacked sandbags in preparation for more flooding this
weekend.
   President Bush declared nine northwestern Georgia counties to be
eligible for disaster assistance in the wake of last week's heavy
rains and tornadoes, and federal officials in Alabama added a dozen
counties to the six that already had been declared disaster areas
there.
   The declarations will make federal money available to people
whose homes or businesses were damaged in storms that have pounded
the Deep South since Feb. 10. Another round of thunderstorms and
tornadoes passed through the region on Thursday, causing some
serious damage in portions of Mississippi and Alabama and injuring
at least 30 people.
   Heavy thunderstorms or rain showers were reported Thursday from
Florida to Michigan. The wet weather was the result of low pressure
that was pulling moisture northward out of the Gulf.
   The new storm raised the threat of more flooding in Mississippi,
Alabama and Georgia, but the fears were largely unrealized. Some
residents of low-lying areas of southern Mississippi expect
flooding this weekend, however, as water rises in the Pascagoula
River from rainfall that occurred earlier upstream.
   ``Looks like Saturday and Sunday will be the two worst days down
here,'' said Hank Turk, director public safety in Mississippi's
Jackson County, where water was as much as 2 inches deep on 20 to
30 roads.
   Turk said there had been no mass evacuations and ``the people
involved have had experience with this sort of thing before. They
have already made preparations and they know when it is time to get
out.''
   While high water problems continued to plague the Gulf Coast, an
end to the heavy rain allowed other flood-damaged areas of southern
and eastern Mississippi to continue cleaning up.
   Disaster relief teams toured flood-damaged areas this week, and
Gov. Ray Mabus is expected to request federal disaster assistance.
   Tornadoes touched down Thursday along Mississippi's Gulf Coast
and in several places in rural Alabama. A powerful blast of wind
also swept through Columbus, Ga., but weather officials were
uncertain whether it was a tornado.
   The twisters struck first at the Gulf Coast town of Pass
Christian, Miss., damaging at least 30 homes. They then struck Opp,
Ala., and at least two sections of rural Alabama, the National
Weather Service said.
   Four people were seriously injured in Pike County, northwest of
Opp, when a twister ripped apart three mobile homes.
   The condition of an 86-year-old woman was upgradged from
critical to stable today, and a 64-year-old man also was listed in
stable condition, said Edge administrator Burton Whitaker.
   ``They're improving. I think they're going to be OK,'' he said.
   Two other storm victims originally listed in critical condition,
a 67-year-old man and a 44-year-old woman, were transferred from
Edge to Baptist Medical Center in Montgomery, where a spokeswoman
said they were listed in serious condition today.
   Thursday's storm was accompanied by record high temperatures,
but forecasters said a sharp cold snap would follow.
   In Augusta, Ga., the temperature reached a record 79 degrees
Thursday, but was expected to slide into the 20s by the weekend.
   Cherry Blossom Festival officials in Macon, Ga., worried the
cold would freeze buds on their trees, which were breaking into
bloom early because of the warm weather.
   ``We'll definitely lose some in the freeze,'' Bibb County
Extension Agent Frank Funderburk said.

<HEAD>Union and Government Reach Pay Deal on Ambulance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators reached agreement today on a pay raise
of about 17 percent for ambulance workers to end a dispute that has
disrupted emergency service across Britain for six months.
   Some ambulance drivers said they would vote against the deal
because it did not put them on the same footing as police and
firefighters by including a formula for future wage increases tied
to inflation.
   But Roger Poole, chief negotiator for the five unions involved,
called the pay deal ``simply staggering'' and said the ambulance
unions had ``driven a coach and horses'' through the government's
policy on curbing wage hikes.
   The accord, covering the period from March 1, 1990 until March
31, 1991, was reached after 20 hours of talks between union
officials and managers of the National Health Service.
   Poole said it gives ambulance workers a 17.6 percent pay
increase, while the Health Service put the package at 17 percent.
There is an option for local ambulance companies to add another 2
percent.
   The salaries of ambulance workers would rise from $17,259 to
$18,812 on March 1 and to $20,298 on Oct. 1. Crew members would
also receive a lump sum payment of $1,454, and there would be extra
allowances for staff with specialized training.
   Poole said he was confident the 22,500 ambulance workers and
control room staff would overwhelmingly approve the settlement and
return to their jobs after a vote is taken around March 13.
   In the Liverpool area, branch secretary Ray Clayton of the
National Union of Public Employees said he was dismayed there was
no pay formula to link wage increases with inflation. ``I don't
think the strike will be called off,'' he said.
   Andy Lawrence, an ambulance workers' spokesman in west Sussex,
called the deal ``an insult to our intelligence.''
   Job actions began Sept. 7 when ambulance drivers started
refusing to work overtime. In October, emergency crews stopped
using their radios or in some cases answering calls from control
rooms.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government ordered police and
army ambulances to answer emergency calls starting Nov. 8. It was
the first time they had been used for civilian ambulance calls
since the ``winter of discontent'' of 1978-79 when a series of
public service strikes hit a Labor Party government.
   Some health authorities hired taxis and asked relatives to drive
non-emergency cases to hospitals.
   In some cases, ambulance crews suspended for joining the dispute
carried out their own unofficial service, accepting emergency calls
direct from hospitals or members of the public but not from
ambulance control rooms.

   The funeral of the slain foreign minister
ended in violence today as riot police beat back a huge crowd of
wailing, stone-throwing mourners with nightsticks and tear gas.
   Scores of people were injured by rocks and sticks, and reporters
said they saw police club and arrest dozens of others before the
spontaneous demonstration of grief and rage was brought under
control.
   Cabinet ministers, leading politicians and foreign envoys were
caught up in the melee, which erupted moments after President
Daniel arap Moi left the grounds of the Valley Road Pentecostal
Church in his official limousine.
   No deaths were reported.
   Thousands of people had gathered outside the church, about a
mile from downtown Nairobi, for the service for Robert Ouko, whose
charred body was found with a bullet hole through the skull near
his farm in western Kenya on Feb. 16.
   The crowd was largely quiet until the first mourners inside the
church began to file out, many of them weeping. As the crowd
outside joined in the moaning and crying, police began to move it
back.
   A group of young people, thought to be university students,
shouted, and a hail of rocks, sticks, bottles and other missiles
was let loose. Riot squads charged into the demonstrators, chasing
them through a nearby park and into the city's center.
   Hours later, police and government paramilitary units were still
on Nairobi's streets, dispersing demonstrators and bystanders.
Several cars were stoned and windows smashed in some sections of
the city.
   University students demonstrated in Nairobi for four days
earlier this week demanding an impartial investigation into Ouko's
death. The demonstrations were halted on orders of campus
administrators Wednesday night.
   Ouko was the fourth leading political figure to die violently
since Kenya gained independence in 1963. None of the three previous
murders was solved and in each case the government of former
President Jomo Kenyatta was accused of a coverup.
   Moi's government has released only sketchy details of its
investigation, but has called in three Scotland Yard detectives and
a British pathologist to assist it. They began work Wednesday.
   Ouko appeared to be more popular in death than he was in life.
Although considered one of the most articulate and able members of
Moi's cabinet, he was largely out of the domestic political
limelight as foreign minister, a post he had held since 1979.
   He had barely retained his parliamentary seat in the face of a
strong challenge in his western Kenya constituency in an election
in 1988.
   Following the funeral service, Ouko's body was to be flown to
Kisumu, a major trading center near Lake Victoria in western Kenya,
where his coffin was to be displayed at a sports stadium. From
there, the body was to be taken to his nearby family home in Koru
for burial Saturday.
   Ouko's partly burned body was found in heavy brushland about
four miles from his family farm three days after he left home
before dawn on Feb. 13 without notifying employees or relatives.

   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat said in a letter
released today that he has approved the participation of
Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in peace
talks with Israel.
   It was the first formal statement by the PLO leader that he has
approved terms for Israeli-Palestinian talks, although there have
been hints from Cairo that he was moving in that direction.
   Arafat said in the letter that the PLO would prefer an
international peace conference and ``guarantees that can only be
provided by the great powers and the United Nations.''
   But he added: ``The PLO once more leaned over backward and
approved the idea of a dialogue between representatives of the
Israeli government and representatives of the Palestinian people in
the occupied territories and the diaspora.''
   He said that such talks would have to be part of a process
``aimed at a comprehensive and final settlement'' and that its
agenda ``could cover all the conceptual ingredients of that
process, including the elections and the 10 Egyptian points.''
   The ``10 Egyptian points'' were recommendations put forward by
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to try to get a concensus with
Israel on preliminary peace talks.
   Mubarak, backed by U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III,
has offered to host an initial Israeli-Palestinian dialogue aimed
at reviving stalled Middle East peace efforts.
   Those talks are expected to help clear the way for
Israeli-proposed elections in the occupied territories leading to
limited autonomy of the areas' 1.7 million Palestinian residents.
Hundreds of Palestinians and more than 40 Israelis have been killed
in the Palestinian uprising in the territories.
   Efforts to get the talks under way have been stalled by Israeli
concerns over the composition of the Palestinian delegation and the
agenda.
   Israeli, which refuses to deal with the PLO as a ``terrorist
group,'' has not yet agreed to participate in the prelimintary
talks urged by Mubarak.
   Arafat's letter was sent to a meeting in Jerusalem by Jewish
peace activists called the Special Emergency World Jewish
Leadership Peace Conference, which concluded Thursday.
   Rita Hauser, a New York peace activist who attended the
conference, told reporters that the letter was received ``through a
circuitious manner, via fax'' on Thursday but that conference
leaders had been unable to ``get it fitted in'' amid the
conference's heavy schedule.
   It was presented at a board meeting today of the Tel Aviv-based
International Center for Peace in the Middle East, which sponsored
the conference.
   Ms. Hauser, an attorney and head of the center's American
branch, met with Arafat in Stockholm in December 1988. Hauser said
she had been in fax contact with the PLO since that meeting.
   Shortly after their meeting, Arafat made a series of historic
announcements recognizing Israel's right to exist and renouncing
terrorism. Those statements led, in turn, to the United States
resuming contacts with the PLO for the first time since 1975.
   Arafat's letter to the Jerusalem meeting of Jewish peace
advocates was dated Feb. 17 and came from Tunis, where the PLO is
headquartered. There was no explanation for the delay in its
transmittal to Jerusalem.
   In the letter, Arafat repeated the PLO's call for creation of an
independent Palestinian state in the occupied territories, which
were captured by Israel from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   ``We remain deeply convinced that the only real security
guarantee for Israel lives in a peaceful settlement based on the
termination of the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian and Arab
territories and the acceptance of the two-state principle,'' he
wrote.
   Arafat noted that Israel has been fearful of dealing with the
PLO, and said that Palestinians had similar concerns about dealing
with the Jewish state.
   ``Watching the convoluted maneuvers the Israeli government has
engaged in and the massive obstacles with which it has littered the
path to peace, the Palestinian people are not filled with
confidence in the good intentions of the Israeli leaders,'' Arafat
wrote.
   He continued: ``To them, the only guarantee of their own
security and their political future lies in the full participation
of the PLO in all stages of the peace process.''
   Such a role has been ruled out by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir. In an interview published today in The Jerusalem Post,
Shamir was asked what the PLO could do to make itself an acceptable
negotiating partner.
   ``The only thing it should do is dismantle itself,'' Shamir
replied. ``Because its minimal demand is a Palestinian state, and a
Palestinian state cannot co-exist with Israel.''

<HEAD>88 Percent Of Chinese Women Practice Birth Control</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Birth control is practiced by 88 percent of
Chinese married women of child-bearing age, but poor-quality
contraceptives lead to a high rate of unplanned pregnancies, a
State Family Planning Commission official said.
   Zhu Yaohua said 46 percent of the 164 million women practicing
contraception used intra-uterine devices, the China Daily reported
Friday.
   Female sterilization, or tubal ligation, and vasectomies were
the next two most common forms of preventing births, she said.
   Figures on other methods were not listed. State Planning
Commission figures for 1988 showed IUDs accounted for 41.1 percent
of contraception, female sterilization for 36.1 percent and male
sterilization for 11.4 percent.
   Oral pills, at 5.8 percent, and condoms, at 4 percent, were far
less popular.
   Zhu said structural faults in the Chinese-made IUDs and
insertion problems resulted in a high number of unplanned
pregnancies.
   U.N. Population Fund officials in Beijing have said there is a
10 percent failure rate for the IUDs, a major reason why there were
12.68 million abortions in China in 1988, more than one for every
two live births.
   China adheres to a strict one-child-per-family policy, and women
who become pregnant outside the state plan are often pressured to
have abortions.

<HEAD>Latest Guide Might Make Victorian Blue Blood Run Cold</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The names of illegitimate children of British
aristocrats have been printed for the first time in a famous guide
to bluebloods.
   It's something of a revolution for ``Debrett's Peerage and
Baronetage,'' the weighty reference book that first came out in
1769 and appears every five years.
   ``We have put them in at the request of those families who
wanted the names of natural children to appear,'' said editor
Charles Kidd at the launch of the latest edition Thursday night.
   ``Across the country, about one in every four children is born
out of wedlock. If parents agree, we believe that Debrett's should
record illegitimate issue to ensure the book is comprehensive,
although these children still cannot inherit a title,'' he said.
   Kidd said about 200 names had entered the huge book as a result
of changing social attitudes, but he has not helped readers by
printing a list.
   ``You'll have to search them out,'' he said.
   It takes some searching and will have to be done by someone who
knows plenty about the offspring of the upper classes. There are
2,300 families in the book involving tens of thousands of names.
   But Lady Elizabeth Berkeley gave permission for her entry to be
publicized. Her composer-husband, the late Sir Lennox Berkeley, was
the son of an illegitimate member of the Earl of Berkeley's family
and was barred from Debrett's.
   Although the earldom is extinct, five Lennoxes have gotten into
the book as a result of the policy change, and Lady Elizabeth said:
``I am delighted. My only regret is that my husband did not live to
see it.''
   ``He could never have the title or the family castle, but what
really hurt him was that his father had no existence in
Debrett's,'' she said.
   Other entries of the illegitimate include offspring of the 24th
Earl of Erroll, a premier peer of Scotland whose family motto is
``Bear the yoke.''
   ``At the beginning of the 18th century, fathers always claimed
their illegitimate children, and put them in the parish registers.
It was only Victorian prudery that swept them all under the
carpet,'' said Frances-Jane French, a specialist on the Anglo-Irish
aristocracy.
   ``There's no reason at all why Debrett's should take a
moralistic line. A lot of our aristocrats sprang from the
mistresses of King Charles II,'' said jovial Ian McCorquodale,
chairman of Debrett's Peerage Ltd.
   The new Debrett's also includes adopted children for the first
time, although they also cannot inherit titles.
   ``We are simply keeping abreast of changing social fashions,''
said Kidd's co-editor, David Williamson.
   Among hundreds of other, legitimate new entrants in the book is
film actress Jamie Lee Curtis, who starred in ``A Fish Called
Wanda,'' and entered the aristocracy by her 1984 marriage to the
Hon. Christopher Guest, a relative of Viscount Wimborne.
   Actor Nigel Havers is also in, because his father, the former
Sir Micahel Havers, was given a life peerage after being forced by
ill-health to resign the lord chancellorship in 1987 after holding
it for four months.
   The 169th edition of ``Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage'' weighs
nearly 5 pounds and contains 2,400 pages, including 96 pages of
advertisements for antique shops, schools, hotels and charities
such as the International League for the Protection of Horses, and
the Indigent Gentlewomen of Scotland.
   It costs $205, a whopping price for a book, and between 6,000
and 7,000 copies will be sold worldwide, the company says.

   Harold L. Goodwin, a retired government
official who wrote science adventure, oceanology and space stories,
has died at age 75.
   Goodwin, a retired deputy director of the National Sea Grant
Program, died of a heart attack Sunday at his home.
   Goodwin began writing the Rick Brant series of science adventure
stories under the pen name John Blaine in 1947 based on his world
travels as a government official. One is to be published this year.
   He wrote books for children and adults on the oceans and space
under the names Blake Savage and Hal Gordon.
   Goodwin served as a Marine officer and combat correspondent in
World War II. He was responsible for the first Navy broadcast from
New Caledonia on the war in the South Pacific and received a medal
and presidential citation for combat missions over Iwo Jima and
Guadalcanal.
   In 1961, he worked as special assistant to the administrator of
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and in the 1950s
as director of Operation Deep Freeze in the Navy. He also was
director of operations for the Civil Defense Administration.
   Born in Ellenburgh, N.Y., Goodwin was raised in Baltimore and
Springfield, Mass.
   Goodwin is survived by his wife, Elizabeth Swensk, three sons,
three grandchildren and a brother. Funeral services were scheduled
for Friday in Bethesda.

   Vandals broke into a synagogue in a
northwestern city and destroyed furniture and religious objects, a
Jewish organization reported today.
   In the city of Oradea, 330 miles northwest of Bucharest,
unidentified assailants smashed windows and broke down the doors of
the synagogue on the night of Feb. 15-16, said Teodor Blumenfeld,
general secretary of the Federation of Romanian Jewish Communities.
   They tore apart the building, apparently in search of gold and
silver objects, he said. They did not find any but destroyed prayer
books and prayer shawls, Blumenfeld said.
   He estimated the damage at 30,000 lei, or $1,500 at the official
exchange rate. No one had been arrested, he said.
   Romania's chief rabbi, Moses Rosen, said last week that he
feared a surge of anti-Semitism in the more open climate following
the December revolution that ended Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu's 24-year rule.
   He said groups like the Iron Guard, Romania's former Nazi-allied
fascist movement, could be reborn.
   Rosen, who has been chief rabbi for 41 years, met last week with
interim President Ion Iliescu and asked for a ``guarantee of
existence'' for his community, which has been reduced from some
850,000 on the eve of World War II to 20,000 today.
   Half of Romania's Jewish community was wiped out in the
Holocaust, and 400,000 were allowed by Romania's Communist
authorities to settle in Israel after the war.
   Blumenfeld said security guards and alarm systems were being
provided for synagogues around the country. Nonetheless, he called
the attack in Oradea an isolated incident.
   The independent national daily Romania Libera, which published
news of the attack in today's editions, condemned it as a ``grave
act of vandalism.''
   The newspaper, the most widely read daily in Romania, also
contained what appeared to be a report of an attack by a right-wing
group on government headquarters in the city of Bacau, 190 miles
northeast of Bucharest, that left a man dead.
   The Bacau police chief, Gheorghita Toader, said in a telephone
interview that no attack had occurred, and the report apparently
was describing a hypothetical situation.

   The Justice Department today defended its
negotiations with Exxon Corp. about settling possible criminal
charges from the Alaskan oil spill, saying any deal will not
compromise the state's legal rights.
   Department spokesman David Runkel, responding to criticism of a
possible deal by environmental groups and Alaskan officials, said
the Justice Department was ``puzzled by comments which have been
reported by persons who appear to have little grasp of what is
actually involved in this case.''
   Runkel said the discussions involve ``a number of complicated
legal and factual issues.''
   ``No actions taken by the federal government in the enforcement
of federal criminal laws will compromise the State of Alaska's
ability to pursue the violations of its criminal laws or
appropriate civil remedies,'' Runkel said.
   ``Nor will the rights or private parties, including the
environmental groups and Alaska residents, to pursue appropriate
civil claims be adversely affected by any actions of the federal
government in the criminal law area,'' Runkel said.
   He declined to discuss the specific items of the plea
negotiations, which sources say have been going on for several
weeks.
   ``As in most cases of this type, there have been discussions
with attorneys for Exxon as to the admissible parameters of
appropriate penalties and appropriate corrective measures in the
event of a guilty plea to any criminal charges that might be
brought,'' Runkel said.
   Runkel also declined to say whether any negotiated settlement
would cover civil claims the federal government could bring against
Exxon.
   His comments were in response to statements by environmentalists
and Alaskan officials that criticized what they understood to be
the proposed deal.
   Alaska Attorney General Douglas Baily, speaking Thursday in
Juneau, accused the Justice Department of trying to get the state
to issue ``a hasty endorsement'' of an inadequate draft proposal.
   ``Under the proposed agreement, the federal government would
abandon its commitment to Alaska to assist with its civil claims
against Exxon,'' Baily told reporters. He said he hoped the
agreement would be revised to make it more acceptable to the state.
   ``We are being asked to accept a pig in a poke. ... And that pig
smells awfully bad,'' he said.
   ``From all accounts the Bush administration is giving Exxon a
wink and a nod ... a mere slap on the wrist,'' added Jay Hair,
president of the National Wildlife Federation.
   Sources said the draft agreement calls for Exxon to pay up to
$500 million into a natural resources restoration fund over the
next seven years and possibly a significantly smaller amount in
direct criminal penalties to the U.S. Treasury.
   The agreement, if made final, would allow Exxon, whose tanker
spilled more than 11 million gallons of oil into Alaska's pristine
Prince William Sound in March 1989, to avoid an embarrassing
criminal trial and possible criminal prosecution of individual
corporate officials.
   The criminal laws used by federal prosecutors in oil spill cases
allow fines of up to double the cost of the cleanup. Exxon has said
it has spent nearly $2 billion to clean up the oil spill.
   Exxon attorneys, in the negotiations with the Justice
Department, have tried to limit the amount of money to be paid to
the U.S. Treasury as criminal penalties, preferring to pay most of
the money into the restoration fund, sources said.
   But one government source suggested Exxon might have to pay only
about $150 million initially, and subsequent annual payments over
seven years would be open to Exxon challenges.
   Environmental lawyers said that money paid for restoration under
the criminal settlement could be tax-deductible as an ordinary cost
of doing business and could be used to reduce future assessments
against Exxon under various civil proceedings. Criminal penalties
could not be deducted from future assessments, nor would they be
tax-deductible.
   No criminal charges have been filed in federal court against
Exxon as a result of the Alaska spill, pending the outcome of the
plea-bargaining. State officials last year agreed that the federal
government would handle criminal charges against Exxon while the
state focused on civil litigation.
   Although details of the proposed agreement remained sketchy, the
process brought attacks from environmentalists and Alaska state
officials. Eleven environmental groups filed papers in U.S.
District Court in Anchorage asking that any out-of-court settlement
between the Justice Department and Exxon be reviewed in an open
court hearing.
   Mike Matz, chairman of the Alaska Coalition, a group of
environmental and civic organizations, said the Bush administration
was moving too quickly to settle with Exxon. He characterized the
reported settlement as ``little more than a slap on the wrist.''
   Michael Fischer, executive director of the Sierra Club, accused
the Bush administration of ``being too eager to forgive Exxon'' by
trying to reach ``a quick and dirty settlement'' with the oil
company.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., also criticized the Justice
Department bargaining with Exxon, saying the agreement ``may not
provide full damages'' and might jeopardize the rights of other
parties seeking damages from the oil company.

   The threat of being eaten prompts some snails
to grow bigger and live longer, two zoologists report.
   That doesn't mean that France is facing any danger from giant
escargot.
   But it does suggest that controlling snail populations may not
be a simple matter of sending predators after them, say Todd A.
Crowl and Alan P. Covich in Friday's edition of the journal Science.
   Crowl and Covich discovered that the widely distributed
freshwater snail Physella virgata virgata lives longer and grows
larger when it's being hunted by crayfish than it does when it's
left alone.
   Snails living in streams without crayfish grew rapidly to a
shell length of about 4 millimeters (0.16 inch), at which time they
stopped growing and began reproduction. They lived between 3 and 5
months.
   But snails living in streams where crayfish preyed on them
continued growing until they reached the length of 7 millimeters
(0.27 inch) to 11 millimeters (0.43 inch) before starting to
reproduce. And these snails lived 11 to 14 months.
   At first the researchers wondered if they had simply encountered
different types of snails in different streams, or if they were the
same type and somehow responded to being hunted by crayfish.
   To find out, they treid raising snails in four types of stream
water.
   Regardless of their origin, snails were small and lived shorter
lives when raised in water that had been exposed only to snails,
water that had been exposed only to crayfish and water that had
been exposed to snails and crayfish separately, the researchers
found.
   But raising the snails in water that had been exposed to
crayfish who were hunting and eating snails resulted in snails that
grew larger and lived longer, they reported.
   ``Our results suggest that snails are capable of detecting a
chemical cue that results from crayfish actively foraging snails,''
concluded Covich and Crowl.
   Crayfish eat lots of juvenile snails, but the prey rate declined
as snail size increased, they found.
   ``Thus, by delaying the onset of reproduction and growing to a
larger size, snails decrease mortality due to size-specific
predation,'' they observed.
   Rapid responses of this type may be more important than genetic
changes in avoiding being eaten, they concluded. Plus, the
reactions of the snails ``suggest that the application of simple
predator-prey models to biologically control snail populations may
be of limited use.''
   Changes in life history in response to being preyed upon have
been observed in some plants and invertebrates, but the reaction is
``novel'' for snails, they report.
   Covich is with the Department of Zoology at the University of
Oklahoma. Crowl, formerly with that department, is currently
affiliated with the Department of Fisheries and Wildlife at Utah
State University and the Department of Zoology at Otago University,
Dunedin, New Zealand.

<HEAD>Sihanouk Returns to Live in Cambodia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRUNNSTROM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ODDAR MEANCHEY PROVINCE, Cambodia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, once Cambodia's ruler and now a guerrilla leader,
returned from 11 years of exile Friday to live in a ``liberated
zone'' until his entire country is free.
   As Sihanouk entered the country, one of the three guerrilla
groups in his alliance said they had lost a strategic town to
soldiers of the Vietnamese-sponsored government in Phnom Penh.
   Gen. Dien Del, deputy commander of the Khmer People's National
Liberation Front, told reporters the army retook Svay Chek on
Friday with the the aid of Vietnamese troops. Vietnam says it
withdrew all its soldiers in September after 11 years of
occupation, but the guerrillas claim some remained.
   Sihanouk told about 100 reporters brought in by bus for the
homecoming: ``All Cambodians want to live in Cambodia and die in
Cambodia. I am 68 years old and I feel more and more I could die on
foreign soil, even if it is friendly foreign soil like China or
North Korea.''
   With him were his wife, Monique, and their platinum-white
poodle, Mickey. Sihanouk, who has lived in exile since the
Vietnamese invasion in December 1978, will be 68 on Oct. 21.
   Armed guerrillas and civilians chanted ``Long live his Royal
Highness!'' as the smiling prince's party crossed by car from
Thailand to a parched field about 100 yards inside Oddar Meanchey.
After the ceremony, the prince drove farther east into Cambodia.
   Sihanouk's guerrilla alliance includes his own group, the
Liberation Front led by Sonn Sann and the Khmer Rouge, the
strongest faction, which governed Cambodia from April 1975 until
the Vietnamese invasion ended its brutal rule.
   The guerrillas had scored major victories in Oddar Meanchey and
other northwestern regions in the past few months, but Premier Hun
Sen's government recently began a counteroffensive. The capture of
Svay Chek was its first victory.
   Phnom Penh radio said the army ``succeeded in completely
recapturing Svay Chek. We are now in full control of this area.''
   All the guerrilla factions went on the attack after the
Vietnamese withdrawal in late September. Sihanouk's group took
strategic Thmar Puok and the Khmer Rouge captured Pailin, a
gem-mining center. The government's campaign broke a lull of
several weeks.
   An article in Friday's editions of The New York Times quoted two
senior Eastern European diplomats as saying several thousand
Vietnamese troops and military advisers returned to Cambodia in
October to help government troops defend Battambang and Sisophon,
two important cities in the northwest.
   It quoted the diplomats, who were not identified further, as
saying about 5,000 Vietnamese soldiers were in Cambodia. Cambodian
and Vietnamese officials deny there are Vietnamese troops in
Cambodia or that any returned.
   Since fleeing the Vietnamese invasion, Sihanouk has lived in
palaces and luxury hotels in China, North Korea, Thailand, France
and other countries that support his guerrilla movement and have
provided him with a comfortable life.
   In northwestern Cambodia, he will live in a one-room village
house without running water or regular electricity, said Ek
Sereywath, Sihanouk's spokesman in Bangkok.
   His staff will consist of cooks and two personal assistants, the
spokesman said, and food and supplies will be brought in fron
Thailand.
   Ek Sereywath said Sinhanouk would divide his time between two
newly captured villages that have been renamed Sereipheap, or
``Freedom,'' and Ekareach, or ``Independence.'' The exact locations
of the villages were not revealed.
   The prince said he would not lead his guerrilla army from the
villages, but would concentrate on helping supply food, medicine
and clothing to civilians. He said the hundreds of thousands of
refugees in camps in Thailand were welcome to follow him home if
the Thai government would allow it.
   Sihanouk ascended the throne in 1941 and led Cambodia to
independence from France in 1953. He was overthrown in a 1970
military coup after resisting U.S. attempts to draw Cambodia into
the Indochina war.
   He spent 1975-78 under house arrest by the Khmer Rouge, who
embarked on a radical agrarian revolution that resulted in at least
1 million deaths by execution, starvation or disease.
   On Wednesday, Sihanouk met in Bangkok with Hun Sen, the premier
installed by Vietnam. They agreed on the need for a U.N. presence
in Cambodia and formation of a ``supreme national body'' that was
not defined.
   A new round of peace talks involving the guerrillas, Hun Sen's
government, Vietnam, France and Southeast Asian countries are to
begin Monday in Jakarta, Indonesia.

<HEAD>Peace Corps Coming to Poland, Eagleburger Continues Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first Peace Corps program in Poland
was established Friday as U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger continued talks with Polish officials on American aid
for economic reforms.
   Eagleburger, appointed by President Bush to coordinate aid to
Poland, also heard Poland's demands that its western border be
assured before German reunification.
   The two-day trip that began Thursday was described as a
``working visit'' by U.S. officials, with a series of closed-door
meetings between Polish finance officials and the U.S. delegation,
which included Deputy Treasury Secretary John Robson.
   Under the Peace Corps program, about 60 volunteers will begin
arriving this summer, mainly English teachers to train Polish
instructors.
   Earlier this month, the Polish Education Ministry announced that
Russian study would no longer be required in schools. But officials
said the introduction of Western languages to the schools would be
slowed by the lack of qualified teachers.
   The Peace Corps has launched similar language training in
Hungary, but U.S. officials said the Polish effort may be expanded
to include agricultural assistance and other Peace Corps programs
usually offered to developing nations.
   Eagleburger also met with President Wojciech Jaruzelski and
leaders of the Roman Catholic church, which is distributing some
U.S. aid.
   Economic help for Poland, especially to lighten the weight of
Poland's $40 billion debt to the West, was to be the key agenda
topic.
   Prime Minister Taduesz Mazowiecki used the visit to press
Poland's views on Germany.
   ``We talked also about the most topical matter at present, that
is the unification of Germany and the Polish presence at
internatinal negotiations to that effect,'' Mazowiecki told the
official PAP news agency after meeting with Eagleburger on Thursday.
   Poland is pressing for a seat at reunification talks planned by
the two Germanys and the four World War II occupying powers: the
United States, Soviet Union, France and Britain.
   On Wednesday, Mazowiecki called for drafting a ``peace treaty''
establishing the border during the talks.
   About one-third of Poland is comprised of lands forfeited by
Germany after the war to compensate Poland for an even larger
eastern territory annexed by the Soviet Union.
   East Germany and West Germany individually have signed
agreements recognizing the border. But West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, some of whose political supporters still consider the
lands part of Germany, has said he cannot make promises about the
border on behalf of a reunified Germany.
   ``Taking advantage of the presence of the representatives of the
U.S. administration, I presented the Polish point of view on this
issue, which was included in a letter to President Bush,''
Mazowiecki said.
   The United States has so far not endorsed Poland's demand to
take part in the six-nation talks on reunification, and Eagleburger
said he would not take a stand on ``this very complicated issue.''
   Eagleburger said he expected Mazowiecki would discuss the
question with Bush when he visits Washington in March.
   In the econmic arena, Polish Finance Minister Lesek Balcerowicz
said the talks were not expected to yield any immediate
announcements, the official news agency PAP said.
   Balcerorwicz, who shaped the dramatic drive to reshape the
economy as a market-driven system, said the Eagleburger delegation
showed ``much understanding'' for his request that Poland be able
to start drawing on a $45 million U.S. enterprise fund after the
first quarter of 1990.
   Also on the Polish agenda for the meetings with Eagleburger was
the foreign debt, more than $3.1 billion of which is owed to the
United States, and obtaining new credits.
   The Polish side also is seeking assistance in the agricultural
sector, including preferential sales of grain and foder,
investments in environmental projects and help rebuilding the
infrastructure, especially modernizing telecommunications, the
Polish press reported.

<HEAD>Safety Board Says Gulf Of Mexico Pipelines Pose Hazard to Fishing
Boats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government should correct the
danger posed to thousands of fishing vessels by poorly buried on
unburied pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico, safety officials said
Friday.
   The National Transportation Safety Board, in its investigation
of an October fishing boat fire that killed 11 crewmembers, urged
the Transportation and Interior departments to identify, inspect,
maintain and protect the more than 18,000 miles of underwater
pipeline along the gulf's outer continental shelf.
   The boat, the Northumberland, snagged and ruptured a 16-inch
natural gas pipeline about a half mile offshore near Sabine Pass,
Texas.
   The gas ignited, and within seconds the vessel was engulfed in
flames, killing all but three of the 14 people aboard.
   Investigators determined that portions of the high-pressure
pipeline had been exposed for up to 10 years.
   The board said at least 20 other incidents of ships damaging
offshore pipelines have occurred in the gulf in recent years. The
most serious before the Northumberland accident was in 1987, when
the fishing vessel Sea Chief struck and ruptured a natural gas
pipeline in Louisiana water, resulting in a fire that killed two
crewmembers.
   The continental shelf lies under shallow waters of from nine to
12 feet in spots, where the law requires that pipelines be at least
three feet below the sea bottom. But many older pipelines were
never buried, the board said.
   In letters to Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan and Transportation
Secretary Samuel Skinner, the safety officials called upon the two
departments to cooperate in protecting ships that may operate
outside established sea lanes.
   Up to 35,000 shrimping vessels, as well as other fishing boats,
operate in the gulf's shallow waters over a web of pipelines, the
board said.
   It quoted officials of the U.S. Geological Survey as saying that
coastal erosion can be severe along the gulf coast.
   ``Winter storms, hurricanes and the placement of man-made
structures such as jetties can accelerate the erosion and
subsidence rates and lead to the removal of sediment covering a
pipeline,'' the board said.
   ``Marine vessel operators cannot presume that offshore pipelines
in water depths less than 12 feet are buried and their vessels,
therefore, are protected,'' said the letter signed by Board
Chairman James L. Kolstad.
   The board said that, although the number of reported incidents
remains small, it may be a growing problem.
   The board called upon federal authorities to determine the
extent of pipelines in the gulf and set up a system for inspecting
them. No regulations exist to ensure that pipes remain buried, the
letter said.

   A minor-league baseball team affiliated
with the Chicago White Sox has been sold to a major Japanese
brewery, and the new owners say they don't plan any major changes
for the successful farm club.
   The new owners of the Birmingham Barons are Martin Kuehnert, an
American, and a new holding company formed by Suntory
International. The New York-based company is the U.S. subsidiary of
Suntory Limited, a Japanese multinational food, beverage and
restaurant company.
   Kuehnert, 43, who spent the past 20 years as a sports
entrepreneur and broadcaster in Japan, will be the Barons' new
president and chief executive officer.
   Suntory spokesman Takafumi Kashiwagi said in Tokyo that there
would be no other changes in team management and that Suntory would
not employ any of its executives with the team.
   No financial details of the sale were disclosed. However, Asahi
Shimbun, a national newspaper in Japan, estimated the price at more
than $3 million.
   The brewery, which recently began sports and music businesses in
Japan, plans to expand its entertainment operations. He said the
company had no intention of buying a Japanese baseball team.
   ``When it comes to entertainment, America is an advanced
country, and we are hoping to learn a lot from the Barons,''
Kashiwagi said.
   Baseball is a national sport in Japan, and former American
baseball players regularly play for Japanese teams. A Japanese
major league team recently offered to buy the Durham Bulls in North
Carolina after some of its officials saw ``Bull Durham,'' the movie
about the minor league club, but the team president said it wasn't
for sale.
   Art Clarkson, the Barons' principal owner, will remain with the
organization as general manager and chief operating officer.
   ``We have 100 percent control,'' said Kuehnert, who returned to
the United States in October and has bought a house in the
Birmingham area. ``Suntory is the majority owner and I'm the
minority owner.''
   The Barons play in the Class AA Southern League and the sale is
expected to be approved by league directors.
   Some minor-league teams in the United States are owned by
major-league teams, others are privately owned. The privately owned
teams work under agreements with the major league teams to train
its players.
   Suntory International imports wine, beer and other beverages
into the United States and is a soft drink bottler. It also owns
Chateau St. Jean Winery in Sonoma, Calif., and restaurants in
Boston, Chicago and Honolulu.

   Andy Rooney is expected to return to ``60
Minutes'' before his three-month and suspension is up, perhaps as
early as next week, according to reports published today. But a
source familiar with the situation cast doubt on the reports.
   ``Absolutely nothing has been determined,'' the source said in
response to the reports in today's editions of The Wall Street
Journal and New York Newsday. The newspapers said Rooney and CBS
News President David Burke held talks this week about Rooney's
return.
   ``Burke is trying to review this thing and reach a conclusion,''
said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``But no
decisions have been reached. None.''
   Rooney told the Journal that ``there was a chance I could have
come back on Sunday,'' but those plans collapsed. The newspaper
said he could be back as early as March 4. In The Washington Post,
Rooney was quoted as saying he could be back ``within a month.''
   Newsday cited unnamed sources as cautioning that CBS was still
figuring how and when to lift the Feb. 8 suspension, but said the
commentator could be back on the air as early as next week.
   The network suspended Rooney without pay for three months for
racial remarks he was quoted as making in The Advocate, a gay
magazine based in Los Angeles. Rooney has denied making the remarks.
   The possible lifting of the suspension coincides with a slight
drop in the ratings of ``60 Minutes.''
   The program has fallen from fifth place among network programs
when Rooney last appeared three weeks ago, to 10th place two weeks
ago and to last week's 11th place ranking, according to figures
compiled by the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   Burke called Rooney earlier this week and arranged a meeting
Wednesday at the CBS News Broadcast Center, Newsday said.
   Rooney said that he and Burke ``had a very pleasant conversation
and he conceded that there was nothing personal. I like him fine.''
Burke declined to comment on Rooney's situation, the Journal said.
   Rooney, in anticipation of an early return, prepared a piece on
his civil rights record for this Sunday's edition of ``60
Minutes,'' but it was not scheduled to be aired until at least the
following week, according to the reports.
   As of last Friday, CBS had received 5,133 calls about Rooney's
suspension, with 5,061 supporting him, said CBS News spokesman Roy
Brunett.
   CBS also has received about 1,800 letters about the matter, but
there has been no breakdown of how many supported Rooney and how
many praised his suspension, Brunett said.

<HEAD>Bush, Kohl to Discuss `Where Things Going' on German Reunification</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl joins
President Bush at Camp David, Md., this weekend to discuss ``where
they think things are going'' in the surging drive toward German
reunification.
   Both U.S. and German officials are promoting the meeting, away
from the formalities of Washington, as symbolizing a personal
relationship between Bush and Kohl, both proponents of
reunification.
   Kohl, just back from a visit to Moscow, was flying to Washington
and on to the presidential retreat Saturday to go over the recent
Ottawa agreement for reunification, face to face.
   The two presidents will discuss such questions as when
implementation meetings should begin among East and West Germany
and the agreement's four other parties _ the United States, France,
the Soviet Union and Great Britain _ said one official. They will
also discuss the future of U.S. troops in Europe.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the two
leaders would discuss ``the full range of issues related to changes
in Eastern Europe,'' including reunification, a U.S. proposal on
reducing conventional forces in Europe, and the future of NATO and
the Warsaw Pact.
   ``We don't anticipate any new agreements or announcements,''
Fitzwater said. He characterized the weekend, when Bush will be
accompanied by Secretary of State James A. Baker III, National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Chief of Staff John Sununu, as
``an opportunity for the two leaders to discuss the status of
events, where they think things are going.''
   Fitzwater said West Germany's newly announced plans for a
one-to-one currency exchange with East Germany probably will be one
topic.
   Kohl also will give Bush a firsthand account of his meeting with
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, who is talking now of a slower
approach to reunification.
   The Camp David agenda could also include an issue that has
caused consternation on the part of at least one of Germany's
neighbors. Poland is worried that a reunified Germany might become
aggressive about retaking territory that was part of Germany before
the World War II victors carved new boundaries.
   The Poles seek a public statement by German leaders and the four
other countries to respect the postwar boundaries. On Wednesday,
Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki stepped up the pressure by
calling on the two Germanys to sign a treaty guaranteeing Poland's
current borders.
   Kohl, who has not made a public statement about the matter, is
under pressure from West German conservatives who want to regain
the territory.
   The separate states of East Germany and West Germany recognized
Poland's boundaries under the 1975 Helsinki Act on European
Security and Cooperation signed by 35 nations.
   Asked about the matter last month, Bush said, ``We have
recognized under Helsinki existing borders, and I have no problem
reiterating that.'' But he said he had ``no judgment'' on whether
there should be multilateral action to reaffirm the borders.
   Coming on the heels of Kohl's Moscow trip and the Germany
reunification agreement reached Feb. 13 in Ottawa, Kohl's visit
with Bush highlights ``a very important historical turning point
for Germany and Europe in general,'' said a U.S. official,
commenting only on condition of anonymity.
   West German government spokesman Hans Klein said it showed ``the
close friendship and responsible partnership between Germans and
Americans.''
   Bush called Kohl twice on the day Baker was in Ottawa working on
the unification document. That accord called for the two Germanys
to develop a plan and meet with the four other powers to approve it
and work out larger security issues.
   Kohl's visit also comes shortly before the March 18 elections in
East Germany that will foretell the direction of a new government
to replace the current caretaker leadership containing both
Communist and opposition members.
   Kohl, embattled on his own home front, is looking also to the
possibility of reunification with an eye toward picking up support
for his party after the two Germanys are one. Elections in West
Germany are Dec. 2.
   The Social Democrats have shown increasing strength against
Kohl's Christian Democrats. Some observers predict that unification
could occur in time to make the Dec. 2 election one covering the
new unified country.
   Kohl, in traveling to Moscow and the United States, continues to
put himself forward as the leader of the unification drive.
   As far as the U.S. role, administration officials have said the
Germans themselves must take the lead on unification. However, Bush
and Kohl are in agreement that U.S. troops should remain in the
western part of Germany, and not move into the East.
   Both also believe that a united Germany should be a member of
NATO.

   Pro-choice forces won two battles when the Indiana Senate

   Abortion rights activists in Indianapolis clapped in the Senate

public hospital ban on a 26-23 vote Thursday evening. It followed a
two-hour debate.
   ``We're not going to be debating this issue again in the Indiana
Senate during this session,'' said Dinah Farrington, a lobbyist for
Planned Parenthood Inc. ``Attempts will be made to bring it back,
but I really don't think we're going to see it on the Senate floor
again for a vote.''
   Today, Blanchard announced his veto of the Michigan bill, which
would have required minors to get permission either from their
parents or a court. The governor said he supported parental
involvement in such decisions, but the bill ``takes a woman's right
to help herself away from her.''
   The actions marked the latest swings in the see-sawing fortunes
of abortion legislation around the country. Earlier in the week,
legislatures in South Carolina and Michigan had given final
approval to bills requiring parental consent for teen-agers seeking
abortions.
   The veto of the measure in Michigan leaves only one question in
the abortion dispute in the state _ whether abortion foes will make
a doomed override attempt or head straight to the voters.
   Barbara Listing, president of Right to Life of Michigan, had
said Thursday that the group's executive committee would wait until
Blanchard vetoed the bill before deciding its plan of attack.
   ``It's likely that we would simply begin as soon as possible
with an initiative petition drive,'' Listing said.
   Blanchard's counterpart in South Carolina, Gov. Carroll
Campbell, has not taken action on the parental consent bill passed
there this week but has said he supports it.
   The Indiana legislation would have prevented doctors in public
hospitals or clinics from performing abortions except in cases of
rape, incest or when the life or health of the mother is threatened.
   Under current law, no public money can be used for abortions,
but some public hospitals perform the procedure by using private
donations and fees.
   The measure also would have required doctors to perform
viability tests before performing abortions after the 20th week of
pregnancy. Doctors failing to conduct the tests could have been
jailed.
   The U.S. Supreme Court in July gave states more power to
restrict abortions. The ruling upheld a Missouri law that banned
abortions in public hospitals and stopped public employees from
counseling women about abortions.
   It also required doctors planning to perform abortions to first
test any fetus over 20 weeks to determine if it could live outside
the womb.

<HEAD>Cheney Confirms Asian Troop Cuts; Soviets Not Impressed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney announced Friday the
Pentagon wants to bring about 12,000 U.S. troops home from Asia,
but a ranking Soviet official said the plan was nothing to ``brag
about.''
   Cheney, ending a two-week visit in the Pacific Rim with a major
policy address before the National Press Club, said that during his
tour he discussed a range of cuts ``on the order of 10 percent,
scattered about the region.''
   He said the first phase could take three years.
   Gennady Gerasimov, head of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's
Information Department, criticized the proposed reductions as
``small-scale'' when compared to Soviet efforts.
   ``The plan is not much to brag about,'' said the Soviet
official, who is in Tokyo to wrap up an Asian tour of his own. ``It
was the natural result of fiscal policies and modernization.''
   Both superpower officials arrived in Tokyo from Manila. Japanese
Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said Gerasimov is a guest
of Kyodo News Service, not the government, and the ``simultaneous
visits are simply accidental.''
   Final decisions on the troop reductions will be made after
further discussions with the military commanders and Congress, the
U.S. secretary said. Congress has pressed Cheney to slash his
defense budget and reassess the reasons for keeping 120,000 U.S.
troops in Asia.
   Cheney, however, said it would be a mistake to reduce the U.S.
presence in Asia just because of eased tensions in Europe, and
America must ``look at the region on its own terms.''
   He also said that despite calls from some lawmakers for 20
percent to 30 percent cuts, he believes Congress will maintain ``a
major U.S. presence in the Pacific.''
   ``In the future, if there are solid indications that regional
stability will not be threatened, we may _ in consultation with our
allies _ make other adjustments that would be appropriate,'' he
said.
   However, Cheney said a total U.S. pullout would open ``a
vacuum'' in the region, leading to destabilizing arms races,
regional tensions, ``and possibly conflict.''
   Cheney, who toured South Korea, the Philippines and Japan, said
the Soviet Union hasn't acted to reduce tensions in Asia as it has
in Europe, and called on Moscow to help calm the region's
flashpoints.
   But Gerasimov, speaking to reporters at the National Press Club
just hours after Cheney, argued that Moscow has already made
substantive reductions, including the mothballing of 50 ships in
its Pacific Fleet and the recent withdrawal of aircraft from Cam
Ranh Bay in Vietnam.
   ``Our presence in Cam Ranh Bay will be replaced by mosquitos and
grasshoppers,'' he said.
   ``Such large reductions as we have carried out were the product
of new thinking ... and cannot be explained by modernization'' as
American military officials have charged, he said.
   Gerasimov dismissed American calls for the Soviets to help
increase stability on the Korean peninsula by exerting more
pressure on North Korea.
   ``North Korea is an independent country, it is not our
satellite,'' he said, pointing out that while there is no foreign
military presence in the North, the U.S. maintains 43,000 troops in
the South.
   ``North Korea has made several proposals for peaceful
reunification (with South Korea), including tearing down the wall
along their border,'' he added. ``Some people say the wall doesn't
exist, but I have seen it from Panmunjom. This is a time for
tearing down such walls.''
   The Soviet diplomat said Moscow is not considering returning to
Japan the disputed Southern Kurils _ small islands off the coast of
Hokkaido that have been occupied by the Soviets since the end of
World War II.
   Japanese officials, following daylong discussions Thursday with
Cheney, called plans for reducing the 50,000 U.S. troops here
``prudent and appropriate.''
   While in Tokyo, Cheney also sought increases in Japan's $2.4
billion annual support toward the $7 billion cost of the American
deployment in Japan. But no specific figures were discussed or
agreed upon, officials said.
   The secretary, who leaves for the United States Saturday, said
that Japan has ``significantly increased'' its spending for U.S.
forces here. ``We think that is a very positive trend,'' he said,
adding that he hoped such increases would continue.

<HEAD>Party Newspaper Cites `Dog Mayor' to Criticize U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The People's Daily isn't known for its sense of
humor, as it proved Friday with a scathing front-page report that
U.S. democracy is going to the dogs.
   The Communist Party newspaper said the town of Sunol, Calif.,
had elected a dog as mayor. The joke, however, may be on the
newspaper.
   ``Western `democracy' has reached such a peak of perfection that
not only can one talk of `democracy' between people, but
`democracy' between dogs and people,'' the newspaper said with
heavy sarcasm. ``There is no distinction between people and dogs.
... No wonder some people prostrate themselves in worship of
Western democracy.''
   The dog election ``can be seen as a wake-up tonic for those
kindhearted people who are naive and ignorant and blindly worship
Western democracy,'' the paper said. ``In the final analysis,
Western nomination systems are a very limited kind of `democracy.'
   Sunol is an unincorporated area of about 400 people in Alameda
County 40 miles southeast of San Francisco.
   Some of the local residents jokingly refer to a beloved black
Labrador named Bosco as the hamlet's ``mayor'' following a mock
election more than 10 years ago when the pooch supposedly beat two
human rival candidates.
   The town actually is governed by the Alameda County board of
supervisors.
   Local media have been known to do periodic stories on Bosco.
   The People's Daily published the story one day after the Foreign
Ministry lashed out at U.S. criticism of its human rights record.
   It also carried articles Friday about the spread of AIDS and
drug use in the United States, bolstering the official image of the
United States as an anarchic and degenerate society.

   Anyone who hates lawyers has a friend in the
White House.
   ``Lawyers certainly deserve all the criticism they can get,''
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater declared Friday.
``Those are universally held feelings by everyone who has ever
dealt with the legal establishment.''
   Fitzwater made his comments at a press briefing when a reporter
asked about President Bush's speech Thursday, in which he promised
government help to ``restore common sense and fairness to America's
medical malpractice system.''
   Fitzwater did not explain the basis of his feelings but said,
``I've never had any personal problem with lawyers, you
understand.'' He said he was sure that ``all my good friends who
are lawyers'' would appreciate his position.
   After his briefing, Fitzwater declined an opportunity to back
off his attack. ``Everyone ought to take every opportunity to blast
lawyers. It's so easy to bash lawyers,'' said Fitzwater, who works
for a government that employs thousands of lawyers and has its own
attorneys in the White House.
   The American Bar Association said it was disappointed with
Fitzwater's comments.
   ``I hope that he wasn't serious,'' said ABA President L. Stanley
Chauvin Jr. of Louisville, Ky. ``And if he was, it was because he
wasn't aware of all the things lawyers do to protect peoples
rights.''
   Moreover, he said the ABA was involved in projects such as drug
education and protecting the rights of the elderly and children.
   ``Most of the people I talk to ... feel that their lawyer is
honest, competent, capable, reasonable and interested in their
welfare,'' Chauvin said. ``It's the one on the other side who's
shifty-eyed.''
   Chauvin offered to stand up for Fitzwater's rights if his
remarks get him in trouble.
   ``If anybody chastises him I'll protect him and his rights,'' he
said, adding with a laugh, ``I'll send him a big bill for it. I'm
expensive. I'll get him out of it, even if it takes every nickel he
has.''

   The Bush administration said Friday that it
would not retaliate against the 12-nation European Community and
South Korea regarding trade barriers imposed against U.S.
telecommunications firms.
   Instead, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said, the
administration will extend for a year the current round of talks
aimed at settling the dispute.
   ``There is much additional work to be done before we obtain the
full market openings we should have, but a decision to end our
negotiations now could halt the momentum we have achieved and
jeopardize future prospects for liberalization,'' Hills said in
announcing the decision.
   South Korea and the European Community were accused by the
administration a year ago of erecting unfair barriers that
discriminate against the sale of U.S. telecommunications products
and services.
   Under the 1988 trade law, U.S. negotiators had a year in which
to try to get the other countries to remove the offending barriers.
If the talks proved unsuccessful, the administration could then
have retaliated by imposing higher tariffs on imports from the
European Community and South Korea.
   Hills said the administration decided to exercise the option to
extend the negotiations for another year on the grounds that
substantial progress had been made in the talks.
   Hills cited several areas where both the European Community and
the South Koreans had liberalized their trade laws concerning
telecommunications equipment.
   ``The Koreans are taking steps to open their market to U.S.
equipment manufacturers,'' Hills said, citing particular progress
in the areas of government purchases, setting standards for foreign
equipment sales and liberalizing tariffs on telecommunications
equipment.
   In 1988, the European telephone equipment market was estimated
at $22 billion while the telephone services market was more than
$50 billion. The South Korean equipment market was put at $1.5
billion.
   ``U.S. telecommunications companies are among the best in the
world. Given the opportunity to compete fairly, they could achieve
a much larger share of the telecommunications markets,'' Hills said
in a statement.

   A sheriff who seized a National Guard
armory because he said there was no other place to put prisoners
won the right today to keep a makeshift jail there for at least two
weeks.
   At a hearing in Hampden County Superior Court, Judge George
Keady approved an interim order that was submitted by attorneys for
both the county and the state.
   ``The parties have worked very hard on this and we will continue
to work on a final solution,'' said Edward McDonough, representing
Hampden County Sheriff Michael Ashe.
   The order allows Ashe to remain at the armory, continue
cooperating with the National Guard and report back in court on
March 12.
   Ashe took over the armory a week ago, telling stunned brigade
officials that he was empowered to seize their facility by 17th
Century statutes ordering him to keep the peace. The regular county
jail was overcrowded, and the sheriff said he needed more space or
he would have to start releasing inmates.
   Four more inmates were moved to the armory Thursday, bringing
the total to 19.
   The inmates say they back the sheriff.
   ``It's all right here. It's open,'' said 24-year-old Wilfredo
Lopez, who said he liked the more rural setting of the armory,
which is near a park.
   ``I like it better here because it's not close to the highway,''
said 29-year-old Donald Blake of Springfield, who has two months to
go on a charge of breaking into a car.

<TEXT>
   Jose Napoleon Duarte, who
became El Salvador's first democratically elected president in 50
years but was unable to end a civil war that battered his nation,
died today of cancer, his doctor said. He was 64.
   The ex-president's personal physician, Jose Luis Saca, said
Duarte died at 11:50 a.m. at home, in the fashionable San Benito
neighborhood on the south side of San Salvador.
   In May 1988, doctors at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in
Washington diagnosed the cancer and removed 60 percent of Duarte's
stomach, but the cancer had spread to his liver. At that time, they
gave him from six to 18 months to live.
   Duarte governed from 1984 until June of 1989, when his Christian
Democrats lost control of Congress and he had to turn the
presidency over to Alfredo Cristiani, leader of the rightist Arena
party supported by the oligarchy that Duarte fought so long.
   Duarte, who was once arrested, beaten and exiled for his
fidelity to democracy, called his inauguration in 1984 ``a light in
the long night of horror,'' and he likened himself to Moses
delivering a people from their tribulations.
   Duarte was crucial to the replacement of an authoritarian,
semi-feudal system with incipient democracy. But he finished his
term, and his life, burdened by failures, compromises, frustration
and dashed hopes.
   The war with the leftist Farabundo Marti Liberation Front
continues after 10 years. Poverty remains endemic in this small
Central American nation of 5 million, where the staggering economy
is dependent on U.S. aid.
   ``He didn't work miracles,'' said a high-ranking U.S. diplomat
who served in El Salvador for most of Duarte's term. ``But he must
be credited with instituting the democratic system itself. His
great legacy is the transition (of government). The rest pales by
comparison.''
   Duarte's opponents criticized his bombast and messianic complex.
Some of his top aides were accused of corruption. His supporters
hailed his idealism and fighting spirit. But adversaries and fans
agree Duarte played a historic role in El Salvador.
   ``One must acknowledge President Duarte's democratic vocation,''
said Cristiani just before he took over on June 1. ``He has, with
his aptitude and positions, promoted the advance of democracy. But
I wouldn't go so far as to call him the father of Salvadoran
democracy.''
   Duarte was born in San Salvador Nov. 23, 1925, the second of
three sons to a tailor father and dressmaking mother. The father
later turned to candy making, a business good enough to put all
three boys through college.
   In 1944, Duarte, who had been a Boy Scout and remained active in
the organization for life, went to Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind.
He graduated as a civil engineer and came home to marry his
childhood friend, Ines Duran, work in her family's construction
business and raise six children.
   The barrel-chested, blue-eyed engineer joined a half dozen other
Roman Catholic professionals in 1960 to found the Christian
Democratic Party. They were mostly young liberals who hoped they
could put the church's social doctrine into practice through
government.
   He served three terms as mayor of San Salvador, gathering a
political following that revered him through years of exile and
trouble.
   He ran for president in February 1972 and was winning handily
when the army stopped the count and declared its candidate the
winner.
   A few weeks later, a dissident military faction attempted a coup
that Duarte supported. When the coup failed, he was arrested,
beaten and told he would be shot.
   He was instead allowed to leave the country. He spent more than
seven years in Venezuela and returned to construction, but kept
active in politics and indulged his hobby of oil painting.
   He came home after a 1979 coup by reformist minded military
officers intent on dismantling the semi-feudal economy that had
made a very few Salvadorans very wealthy while leaving the vast
majority poor and illiterate.
   Duarte joined the ruling junta in 1980 and became its president
in December that year. The army and police embarked on a course of
brutal repression that left tens of thousands of civilians dead,
many by officially sanctioned or tolerated death squads.
   Duarte was criticized for presiding over terror, but he said
things would be worse were it not for his presence.
   In an effort to deprive the guerrillas of an issue, the junta
began what was envisioned as a radical land reform, expropriating _
with compensation _ most of the country's biggest farms and turning
them into cooperatives.
   The reform was a partial political success, but it eventually
bogged down because of organizational and production problems.
   Duarte, popularly elected in 1984, promised his presidency would
bring peace and, with it, prosperity. But in three attempts at
negotiations with the rebels he did not budge from the demand that
they lay down their arms and join the political process _ something
they are now considering in talks with the Cristiani government.
   But at the time the rebels contended conditions for democracy
were absent in El Salvador.
   Duarte, who was fond of weather metaphors, compared the war to a
``typhoon'' in a 1987 interview with The Associated Press.
   Mainly because of the war, the economy crumbled. The decline was
hastened by droughts and a 1986 earthquake that killed an estimated
1,500 people and left tens of thousands homeless.
   U.S. economic and military aid reached nearly $2 million a day.
   Duarte's ability to impress foreign leaders, particularly
members of the U.S. Congress, and elicit aid was universally
recognized. But his opponents on both right and left decried what
they called subservience to U.S. influence.
   Even his supporters cringed when Duarte, at a White House
ceremony before dozens of TV cameras, kissed the U.S. flag.
   As he was being treated for cancer in Washington in June, 1988,
his state-of-the-republic address was read to the legislature.
Aware of the gravity of his disease, Duarte offered an evaluation
of his term.
   ``The will of my people has caused me to navigate seas each day
more stormy and more dangerous because of cross-currents. The
absence of fair winds and persistent adversity all along the route
have joined to prevent us from bringing about our high aims,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   Norwegian Prime Minister Jan P. Syse proposed
Friday a 35-nation, North American-European security conference.
   ``Today, our task is to link the countries of Europe, all of
them, and North America so closely together that a return to the
quarrels of the past can never take place,'' he said in a speech to
the National Press Club.
   He predicted that ``there will be the unavoidable call in some
European quarters for the dissolution'' of the North Atlantic
Treaty Alliance and the Warsaw Pact.
   ``And there will be the calls on this side of the Atlantic for
bringing the troops home _ not some of them, but all. Both views
are equally dangerous. ...''
   He also said that intensified economic competition and the
declining military threat ``could tempt us to focus more on what
divides us and less on what unites us.''
   He suggested that the 12 countries of the European Economic
Community join with Norway and the five others that belong to the
European Free Trade Association to set up what he called a European
economic space. It could be a model for future relations between
eastern and western Europe, he said.
   Earlier, Syse met privately for 30 minutes with President Bush
at the White House.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that the two
leaders discussed East-West relations, maintaining the strength of
NATO, German reunification, arms control and European troop
reduction.

   Atlantis' commander got over his
cold Friday but the weather remained bad, forcing NASA to postpone
for the third time the launch of the shuttle on its secret military
mission.
   Shuttle managers slipped the launch 24 hours to Sunday morning
after weather forecasters predicted high winds and thunderstorms in
the hours leading up to a Saturday launch.
   The forecasters said the cold front causing the problems would
move out by Sunday and there was an 80 percent chance of favorable
weather at the scheduled liftoff time of about 1 a.m.
   That's the best outlook so far for the shuttle mission, which
was originally scheduled for liftoff Thursday.
   The heavy rains and high winds would have prevented crews from
pumping propellant into Atlantis' fuel tank for the four-day
mission to put a spy satellite in orbit. The craft requires more
than a half-million gallons of fuel.
   ``Weather conditions continue to be unacceptable for (fueling)
which would be required for a Saturday morning launch attempt,''
NASA said.
   A mobile launch structure will remain around the shuttle to
protect it from thunderstorms, the space agency said.
   Despite the threatening weather, Atlantis commander John O.
Creighton, a Navy captain, and the shuttle's pilot, Air Force Col.
John Casper, flew a training aircraft Friday.
   Flight surgeons earlier in the day declared Creighton fully
recovered. Creighton and the four other crew members were found to
be healthy during a routine medical exam Tuesday, but the commander
complained of a sore throat the next day.
   His illness, along with predicted thunderstorms, prompted NASA
to postpone Thursday's launch. The agency decided on another
24-hour hold the next day for similar reasons, but delayed
Saturday's launch solely due to weather.
   Each day's delay costs $247,000 in labor and materials. That
does not include expenses at other NASA centers supporting the
mission.
   The exact time of liftoff has not been announced by NASA because
of the clandestine nature of the mission, although the agency has
said the shuttle will go up between midnight and 4 a.m. The
countdown will be kept secret until the final nine minutes before
the rockets ignite.
   Sources report liftoff should occur about 1 a.m.
   Reports on the progress of the mission will be blacked out
throughout the flight. The silence will be lifted an hour before
Atlantis returns to Earth for a landing at Edwards Air Force Base
in California.
   The shuttle will be carrying a spy satellite said to be capable
of taking high-resolution reconnaissance photos and of
eavesdropping on electronic communications around the world,
according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Atlantis will be the 34th space shuttle mission and the sixth
secret military mission.

<HEAD>Democrats Suggest Change in Tax Law for Upper-Income Earners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic leaders said Friday that Congress
may consider cutting income taxes on ``upper-middle-class''
families but raising taxes on the richest Americans.
   However, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and Senate
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, acknowledged there is
little Congress can do to make the tax law more equitable unless
President Bush goes along.
   ``There's not going to be a Democratic light-cavalry charge on
that (tax) issue,'' Mitchell told reporters.
   Foley said he thinks Congress will consider ways to remove a
feature of the 1986 tax law that imposes a lower marginal tax rate
on the wealthiest people than is paid by those with somewhat less
income.
   The marginal rate is the rate paid on the next dollar earned.
For example, under the new law a person with $150,000 income would
pay $330 tax on a $1,000 pay raise while a person with $1 million
income would pay $280 on the same raise.
   Adjusting the tax system to get rid of that quirk ``does not
constitute necessarily a raising of taxes,'' Foley said. That
presumably means it would not violate Bush's pledge not to raise
taxes.
   ``Within a revenue neutrality (that is, without affecting the
federal deficit) you could perhaps provide a more equitable balance
between tax rates paid by what I would call
upper-middle-class-income taxpayers and the very highest-income
taxpayers,'' Foley said.
   ``I don't think the (top) bracket will be raised above 33
percent,'' he said.
   Mitchell added: ``For the first time in American history since
the income tax was introduced, the marginal rate at which income is
taxed declines as income rises above a certain level.''
   Winners in any such tax change would be single people with
taxable incomes (after exemptions and deductions) between roughly
$45,000 and $93,100, and couples between $75,000 and $155,300.
Higher taxes would be paid by singles above $93,000 and couples
above $155,000.
   Foley and Mitchell emphasized their irritation that Bush and his
predecessor, Ronald Reagan, have convinced the public that they
will not accept higher taxes.
   The best evidence of Reagan's political skill, Mitchell said,
was that he ``proposed, supported and signed into law 13 tax
increases ... (yet) convinced everyone in America that he was
against all of them.''
   ``President Bush has got the words down right, but it remains to
be seen if he has the political skill to pull off the same
result,'' Mitchell said.
   Mitchell noted that Bush approved a $6 billion net tax increase
last year, and in the budget he sent to Congress last month
proposed tax increases totaling $15.7 billion, though no general
increase in income taxes.
   Bush wants ``new taxes by anybody's definition,'' Foley said.
   Mitchell said that despite a big tax cut in 1981, federal taxes
are about the same as 10 years ago and the butden has shifted from
high-income to middle-income people. ``It is that which we believe
should be corrected,'' he said.

<HEAD>Funeral For Foreign Minister Ends in Riots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHEGE MBITIRU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people rioted Friday
following the funeral for Kenya's foreign minister, attacking
police with stones and smashing windows in the worst outbreak of
violence since a 1982 coup attempt.
   Scores of people were injured and dozens arrested as Nairobi
police dispersed a huge crowd of wailing, stone-throwing people
mourning the mysterious death of Robert Ouko. Violence also was
reported in the western city of Kisumu, his home, where dozens were
injured, including at least three people shot by police.
   By nightfall, police and paramilitary units had dispersed
demonstrators in Nairobi and Kisumu, but were bracing for more
trouble at Ouko's burial outside Kisumu on Saturday.
   In Nairobi, Cabinet ministers, leading politicians and foreign
envoys were caught up in the melee, which erupted moments after
President Daniel arap Moi left the church service.
   Thousands of people had gathered outside the suburban church for
the funeral service for Ouko, whose charred body was found shot in
the head on Feb. 16. He had been missing from his western Kenya
home for three days.
   The crowd was largely quiet until the first mourners inside the
church began to file out, many of them weeping and ululating. As
the crowd outside joined in the moaning and crying, police began to
move it back.
   The police action brought a hail of rocks, sticks, bottles and
other missiles from the crowd. Riot police, on hand in anticipation
of trouble, charged into the mourners, chasing them through a
nearby park and for nearly a mile to the city's center.
   As the disturbance spread into the heart of the capital, most of
the stone throwing and taunting of police seemed to be taken up by
large gangs of mostly young people, many of them apparently
unemployed day laborers.
   Cars were stoned and windows smashed throughout the city. Some
minor looting was reported.
   From Nairobi, Ouko's body was flown to Kisumu, a city on Lake
Victoria that he represented in Parliament. There his casket was
displayed on a low bier in the middle of a sports stadium on the
outskirts of town.
   Thousands of mourners, mostly from Ouko's Luo tribe, had been
gathering outside the stadium since early morning. When his body
arrived in the afternoon, they filed by the bier single file.
   ``The trouble is that most of them did not get to see the
body,'' said a ranking police officer, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``When the first ones came out, they incited the
others.''
   Roads in Kisumu were blocked, vehicles and buildings were set
afire, shop windows were smashed and cars were stoned.
   Ouko, 58, was the fourth leading political figure to die
violently since Kenya gained independence in 1963. None of the
three previous murders was solved and in each case the government
of former President Jomo Kenyatta was accused of a coverup.
   Ouko also was the highest-ranking politician from the Luo tribe,
one of four major ethnic groups in Kenya that share and jockey for
power in the single-party government and engage in rivalries that
go back centuries. The other groups are the Kikuyu, the Luya and
the Kalengen.
   University students in Nairobi began mostly peaceful
demonstrations early in the week, demanding an impartial
investigation into Ouko's death. The country was abuzz with rumors,
some linking the slaying to tribal rivalries.
   Moi's government called in three Scotland Yard detectives and a
British pathologist to assist the investigation in what was seen as
an attempt to allay fears of a coverup. Only sketchy details of the
inquiry have been released.
   Ouko appeared to be more popular in death than in life. Although
considered one of the most articulate and able members of Moi's
Cabinet, he kept largely out of the domestic political spotlight.
   Burial was to be near his family farm in Koru, about 40 miles
from Kisumu.

<HEAD>BuRec Says New ``Call'' May Be Issued On North Platte Water</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SARATOGA, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ranchers have been warned that unless
mountain snowpacks improve significantly, the Bureau of Reclamation
may issue an order for regulation of North Platte River water in
April.
   But State Engineer Jeff Fassett said the ``call,'' which his
office would have to approve, likely would have little effect on
North Platte irrigators because it probably would last just a month.
   Fassett also added that his office could authorize irrigators
this spring and summer to rotate or exchange water allocations in
order to make the most of it.
   Officials with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation are being
pressured by downstream irrigators with rights to water from BuRec
projects to order the call on the water, the engineer said.
   ``There's no doubt the word `call' on the river has come up,''
Fassett told a meeting of the Upper North Platte Water Users
Association.
   Last winter Fassett and the BuRec issued another call on the
water, the first time such an order had come in the winter in the
history of state regulation on the river.
   Issuing a similar call this April can only be avoided if the
area receives ``huge, above-average snowpacks'' that will fill
downstream reservoirs,'' Fassett said at the meeting Wednesday.
   He noted that this year marks the second-lowest carryover of
stored water in the North Platte drainage in the last 35 years, and
the area is going into its fourth straight dry year with snowpacks
of just 70 percent to 80 percent.
   But Fassett said BuRec officials aren't likely to decide whether
to issue the call until after the March snowpack and streamflow
predictions are available.
   He also noted that the call cannot extend beyond May 1 because
of stipulations included in the North Platte decree _ a 1945 U.S.
decision that established provisions for use of North Platte flows
in Nebraska, Wyoming and Colorado.
   If a call is made this year it will be to regulate other river
water users in favor of the 1904 water rights tied to Pathfinder
Reservoir and the downstream irrigation districts the federal
project serves.
   That would mean all water usually claimed for junior water
rights _ those dated after the agreement _ would first have to go
to fill the Pathfinder right.
   Looking ahead to the summer, Fassett said North Platte
irrigators may have to face the prospect of borrowing water, but so
far state officials are not encouraging such loans.
   Fassett noted that the BuRec would require extensive
environmental evaluation before allowing the loans.
   Last year water loans to irrigation districts generated heated
controversy over state's rights and led to a lawsuit filed against
the BuRec by the state of Wyoming, the Goshen Irrigation District
and the Casper-Alcova Irrigation District.

<HEAD>Time Out of Whack in Britain's Fifth-Warmest Winter</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Daffodils are blooming and fruit trees are budding
as England enjoys the warmest February since the American
Revolution, and the fifth-warmest winter on record.
   Friday's high of 65 degrees Fahrenheit tied a record for the
date, and the coldest temperature all winter was 37 degrees on New
Year's Day.
   ``If you ask me if there is a greenhouse effect _ it hasn't been
proved to my satisfaction, but if this is what it's like, then I'm
all for it,'' said Ken Graves, secretary of the Royal National Rose
Society.
   Outside Graves' office in the quiet cathedral town of St.
Albans, 20 miles north of London, buds are forming on a Gloire de
Dijon rose, and a bit of color is already peeking through.
   Those who believe that global warming has arrived will note that
last winter was even warmer in England. Skeptics might note that
the winter of 1686 was just as warm, and that Thursday's high
temperature was matched in 1961.
   The average temperature in central England this month has been
45 degrees, 7 degrees warmer than normal and the hottest February
since 1779, when the average was 46 degrees.
   There have been but four warmer winters since England started
keeping records in 1659, said Barry Parker of the Meteorological
Office. This winter's average temperature of 43 degrees since Dec.
1 has been exceeded only in 1834, 1869, 1975 and 1989.
   ``I would much prefer a good hard frost for several days,''
Parker said. ``There will be plagues of things going around my
garden in the summer.'' Warm winters have brought a boom in the
population of garden pests.
   Graves knows all about the anxieties of gardeners after a second
straight winter without ice.
   ``We get no end of correspondence at this time of year, and over
the telephone _ `Oh dear, oh dear, my roses have made all these
long new shoots, what shall I do?'
   ``Prune as normal, and forget the new growth,'' Graves advises.
   The mild winter has thrown time out of whack. ``Daffodils, that
come before the swallow dares, and take the winds of March with
beauty,'' as Shakespeare had it in ``The Winter's Tale,'' are
already blooming in some gardens.
   ``There are some varieties flowering rather precociously,'' said
Jim Pearce, president of the Daffodil Society.
   ``There's a variety named `February gold' _ I think it was
rather optimistically named, because this is only the second time
anyone can remember it flowering in February,'' he said from his
home in Colchester in eastern England.
   Warm weather may be a problem for some of the hundreds of flower
shows held around the country, usually in April, Pearce said. ``If
they are entirely daffodils, they're not on a safety streak, are
they?''
   The Royal Horticultural Society has an early show April 3-4, and
its main daffodil show on April 25.
   ``It certainly looks as though the early show is going to be the
main even this time _ subject, of course, to a debacle in the
present climatic conditions,'' Pearce said.

<HEAD>Justice Department Will Ask Supreme Court to Review Flag-Burning
Decision</HEAD>

   The Justice Department said today it will ask
the Supreme Court to review a federal judge's finding that a law
Congress passed last year to ban flag burning is unconstitutional.
   Chief spokesman David Runkel said the Justice Department would
file a notice in Seattle federal court today of its intention to
appeal Wednesday's ruling by a judge there.
   Runkel said the government will then have 30 days to file its
brief in the high court.
   The law that forbids desecretion of the flag provides for a
direct appeal of its constitutionality from federal district court
to the Supreme Court.
   While the Bush administration has in the past supported a
constitutionalamendment to ban flag burning, Runkel said the
Justice Department now has a duty to defend the law enacted by
Congress.
   The law was passed after the Supreme Court last year struck down
a Texas statute that provided criminal penalties for flag burning.
   ``I believe the Supreme Court will reaffirm that the principles
for which the flag stands include the freedom to dissent,'' said
David Cole, an attorney who represented defendants in the Seattle
case.
   Backers of a constitutional ban on flag burning say Wednesday's
ruling shows Congress didn't go far enough when it outlawed flag
desecration.
   But opponents of writing the prohibition into the Constitution
said the real test would come when the case goes to the Supreme
Court.
   ``I wouldn't get too worked up about a district court ruling,''
said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine. ``It's what
we all expected.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said he remained
convinced the law would be upheld by the Supreme Court.
   ``Whatever the outcome is, I do not favor a constitutional
amendment,'' Foley said. ``I believe it would be wrong to amend the
First Amendment.''
   U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein in Seattle ruled Wednesday
the new federal law against flag desecration is unconstitutional
and dismissed flag-burning charges against four people. She said
the right to destroy the flag was as protected as the right to wave
it.
   The case involved four people who challenged the flag-protection
law immediately after it went into effect last October by burning a
U.S. flag outside a Seattle post office.
   Lawyers for three other flag-burners argued before a federal
judge in Washington on Thursday that she should follow Rothstein's
lead. That case involved defendants who burned a flag in a protest
on the steps of the U.S. Capitol.
   Attorneys for Congress likened the law to the ban on burning
draft cards, which was upheld by courts during the Vietnam War.
Charles Tiefer, deputy counsel for the House clerk's office, said
flag-burning ``was not mere speech.''
   Democrats in Congress used the statutory ban to head off efforts
by Republicans and the Bush administration to pass a constitutional
amendment.
   The debate followed last summer's ruling by the Supreme Court
striking down as unconstitutional a Texas law that banned flag
desecration.
   Supporters of the constitutional route promised to renew their
efforts.
   ``This decision vindicates those of us who wanted to fix this
thing and have the states take up the question of protecting the
flag properly,'' said Rep. Chuck Douglas, R-N.H. ``The way to do it
is by a constitutional amendment, and there is nothing short of
that.''
   The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Joseph R.
Biden Jr., D-Del., said he still believed the Supreme Court would
uphold the 1989 law as constitutional.
   ``The fact remains that the flag protection law is
constitutional until the Supreme Court says that it is not,'' Biden
said.
   ``I can assure these Seattle flag-burners that if they will just
go and live in Tehran, Iran, my Kentucky constituents will be glad
to buy them one-way airline tickets,'' Rep. Carroll Hubbard, D-Ky.,
told a nearly empty House chamber.
   He denounced ``malicious flag-burning by those who hate the
United States, but enjoy living here.''

   Thousands of people gathered in
downtown Prague on Friday to welcome President Vaclav Havel home
from his trip to the United States.
   Havel, addressing the crowd from a balcony over Old Town Square,
said he considered his visit successful.
   ``Dear friends, I would like to tell you that we have just
arrived from America. We did not go there to take some rest or
watch the sea and skyscrapers, we went there to do some work,''
Havel said. ``And I think we have achieved far more than we had
expected.''
   He drew laughter from the crowd when he said: ``Somewhere in New
York I saw a poster saying `Havel to the White House.'''
   ``I thought about it and I realized that one small country in a
state of moderate derangement will be enough for me,'' he joked.
   Havel said he found himself in the role of ``messenger boy''
between two important houses: the White House and the Kremlin.
   While in Washington, Havel addressed Congress and met with
President Bush. On Monday, he travels to Moscow where he is to hold
talks with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   He is also expected to sign an accord on the total withdrawal of
some 73,500 Soviet troops from Czechoslovak territory.
   At a subsequent news conference, Havel refused to elaborate on
what message he might be bringing to Moscow.

<HEAD>Bonn Official Says East Germany May Choose Immediate Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany may be too divided after
the March elections to agree on a government and could opt for
immediate union with West Germany, a Cabinet minister said in a
newspaper report published Friday.
   Die Welt of Bonn said Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble
expressed his theory to U.S. officials. Ministry officials
confirmed the account.
   East Germany's economic crisis has accelerated in recent weeks,
forcing the government to end food subsidies and prompting
speculation it is near bankruptcy.
   German reunification, and the economic and political questions
it poses, are expected to dominate discussions this weekend when
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany meets with President Bush at
Camp David, Md.
   According to Die Welt, Schaeuble told Secretary of State James
A. Baker III and Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser,
that East Germany's first free elections may not produce a
leadership that could agree on an economic rescue plan.
   ``It is conceivable that there will be no more (East German)
government after March 18,'' he said.
   Several recent polls, however, have indicated East Germany's
Social Democrats will win more than 50 percent of the vote.
   Communist candidates are expected to fare badly because of the
once-omnipotent party's role in creating the economic crisis.
Premier Hans Modrow, the most trusted Communist politician, has not
decided whether to lead the party ticket.
   Pro-democracy opposition parties are numerous, poorly organized
and inexperienced, which has led to a near-takeover by sister
parties in West Germany.
   The 400-member parliament to be elected March 18 vote is
supposed to choose a government to succeed Modrow's transitional
administration. If the seats are spread too broadly among the many
parties, members may be unable to agree on a leadership that could
work with Bonn on an economic recovery plan.
   Schaeuble said he considered an inconclusive vote the ``more
probable'' outcome of the elections, Die Welt said.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Willi Hausmann, who confirmed the
account, said Schaeuble outlined several possible unification plans
during a visit to Washington.
   Die Welt said he met with Baker and Scowcroft to discuss
anti-drug policies, but the U.S. officials were more interested in
discussing German reunification.
   One of the most critical decisions will be the exchange rate of
East German marks for the West German currency.
   Kohl has offered to make the Deutschmark the official currency
of both nations in return for capitalist reforms, effectively
creating a single economy.
   Economic experts are discussing how the West German mark should
be made legal tender for both, but no decision on monetary union
can be made until after the East German elections.
   A 1-to-1 conversion rate probably would cause rampant inflation
because of the unusually large savings of East Germans, who have
had few goods to buy.
   Dieter Vogel, the West German government spokesman, discounted a
newspaper report Friday that Bonn had decided on 1-to-1. He said a
committee studying economic union still was the ``fact-finding
stage.''
   The newspaper said Schaeuble explained to the U.S. officials
that Article 23 of the West German Constitution, known as the Basic
Law, allows the legislature of any German region to decide to merge
with West Germany.
   ``Article 23 doesn't envision the involvement of West Germany''
in the decision on merging, Schaeuble said.
   No referendum in either German state would be necessary if
Article 23 was used, Die Welt said.
   A parliamentary vote soon after the elections to join West
Germany probably would outpace the ``two-plus-four'' negotiations
proposed by the World War II Allies.
   The two Germanys plus the Soviet Union, the United States,
Britain and France agreed last week in Ottawa, Canada, to negotiate
``external aspects'' of German unity soon after the East German
elections.
   Schaeuble gave Washington what was tantamount to an assurance
Bonn does not seek to regain territory lost to Poland and the
Soviet Union after World War II, the paper indicated.
   It quoted him as saying a transitional legislature would have to
be created after any decision by East Germany to merge, and that
body could recognize the Polish border.
   Recognition of the boundary between with Poland has become a
major issue because Kohl has not committed himself to the current
frontier, which follows the Oder and Neisse rivers.
   About one-third of Poland was German territory before World War
II.

<TEXT>
   The president of Arianespace said Friday a
panel of experts will be named to determine why an Ariane rocket
exploded shortly after takeoff and to reassure customers of its
reliability.
   Frederic D'Allest, head of the European consortium, said he
hoped the failure Thursday of the unmanned Ariane 44-Lor would not
destroy customer confidence in Arianespace, which holds more than
half the world's commercial satellite business.
   While the investigation is under way, all Ariane launches will
be suspended, D'Allest told a news conference at the space center
in Kourou, French Guiana. The news conference was also relayed to
reporters at Arianespace headquarters in Evry, near Paris.
   Twelve to 15 experts will be named to investigate the incident
and issue a report within two months giving ``all the details of
our findings so they (clients) can ... be comfortable that we can
resume flights safely,'' D'Allest said.
   ``If the cause is clear and precise and the problem corrected,
we should rapidly regain the confidence of our clients,'' he said.
   The rocket was carrying two telecommunications satellites for
the Japan Broadcasting Corp. and Space Communications Corp. when it
exploded over the Atlantic Ocean about 7{ miles from the launch pad
at Kourou.
   The investigative panel, to be appointed early next week, must
determine why one of four strap-on boosters that power the rocket
experienced a sudden drop in pressure just 6.2 seconds after the
end of the countdown.
   The automatic pilot then ordered two of the other boosters to
increase power to compensate for the one that failed. But at 30
seconds, the pressure plummeted in a motor in the body of the
rocket adjacent to the booster.
   At 90 seconds, technicians realized the rocket was out of
control, and 11 seconds later the rocket blew apart.
   Debris from the vehicle rained over the coast and the Iles du
Salut just off shore, but no injuries were reported.
   Winds blowing from the east carried a cloud of the fuel back to
land, forcing the launch staff and the 12,000 residents of Kourou
indoors until it passed. Some residents complained of burning eyes
and sore throats.
   French police and soldiers conducted an air search Friday along
the beach for debris from the rocket.
   Witnesses who saw the flight on the video monitors at Evry said
the rocket appeared slightly off course from the start and passed
unexpectedly close above the support scaffolding as it rose, with
flame from one of the boosters burning the structure.
   Officials said the rocket may have touched the scaffolding, but
there was no indication this caused the explosion.
   France's space minister, Paul Quilles, said the explosion should
cast no shadows over the Ariane program, which he noted had had an
``exceptional'' run with 17 successful flights in a row.
   Arianespace competes with the U.S. commercial launch industry.
   The United States depended on its space shuttles to launch
commercial satellites until the Challenger exploded on Jan. 28,
1986. Since then, three major American aerospace companies, Martin
Marietta, McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics, have been
developing and launching commercial satellites.
   But with its earlier start, Ariane has captured more than 50
percent of the market, and it drew business from the American
program after the Challenger explosion.
   The launch was the 36th Ariane mission since the first flight in
the unmanned space program, overseen by the European Space Agency,
was held Dec. 24, 1979. It was the first explosion since the 18th
Ariane flight on May 31, 1986, and the first of the 4 series.
   After the explosion in 1986, Ariane suspended all launches for
15 months to correct a basic design problem. D'Allest said he had
confidence that there is no fundamental design problem with the
rocket's engines and he hoped that launches could resume quickly.
   Since the last failure, flights had become almost routine.
Successful missions have been held on the rate of about one per
month, with 43 satellites launched since the commercial program got
under way in 1981.
   Another 32 are scheduled with a contract value of $2.36 billion.
   The Thursday night launch of the two communications satellites
marked the first time an Ariane mission carried an all-Japanese
payload.
   One, the BS2K, was built by U.S. company General Electric's
aero-space division to direct broadcasting for Japan's national NHK
television network.
   The second, built by Ford Aerospace, was owned by Mitsubishi's
subsidiary Space Communications Corp. to channel telephone,
telegraph and telex messages.
   The BS2K satellite was insured for $150 million to $180 million,
Arianespace said, while the Superbird B was insured for about $60
million.
   In Tokyo, Yoshiro Nakamura, chief technician for NHK, said the
failure was very disappointing but NHK would continue to cooperate
with Arianespace.

   Clint Eastwood has sued a weekly supermarket
tabloid, alleging that it falsely claimed extremists threatened to
kill him for refusing to speak at a convention of white racists.
   The lawsuit, filed Thursday in federal court, alleges the Jan. 2
article in The Globe, headlined ``Nazi Thugs Put Bounty on Clint _
But Dirty Harry Won't Lay Low,'' was false, inflammatory, and
constituted invasion of privacy.
   The story, attributed to unidentified sources ``close to the
actor,'' reported that Eastwood became a target after turning down
a speaking invitation by the Aryan Nation.
   Eastwood ignored the threats, saying, ``I've never shied away
from a fight and I won't start now,'' according to The Globe.
   Court papers filed on behalf of the 59-year-old actor and
filmmaker say he never received such an invitation, never received
any death threats and never uttered that quote.
   Eastwood is asking for $2 million in general damages and $20
million in punitive damages for intentional and negligent
infliction of emotional distress through incitement to violence and
for invasion of privacy.

   Impressionist Rich Little is seeking
custody of his 1-year-old daughter, whose mother is fighting him
over child support.
   Little's lawyer, Gerald Z. Berkowitz, says he succeeded in
having the child support argument heard in Delaware, where the
mother, Lalette Cottrell, and child, Lindsay, live, rather than in
California, where the comedian lives.
   Little is willing to pay support but wants an amount
``consistent with the needs of the child,'' his lawyer said. If the
case were heard in California, Little would have to pay from $5,000
to $10,000 a month, he said.
   ``I don't think the Delaware courts would give her that,''
Berkowitz said. ``And I don't think a child needs $5,000 to $10,000
a month.''
   Little, of Los Angeles, also filed for custody because Cottrell
has ``resisted permitting him to visit his daughter,'' Berkowitz
said.
   Cottrell and her lawyer, Daniel F. Kelleher, would not comment.

   Comedian Redd Foxx was paid $500,000 for his
role in the movie ``Harlem Nights'' and spent $373,000 of it on
``wine, women, song and gambling,'' the Internal Revenue Service
says.
   Such expenditures make it unlikely the IRS can reach agreement
with Foxx on his tax troubles, IRS attorney Rollin Thorley told a
federal bankruptcy judge Thursday.
   Foxx, who gained fame playing a junk dealer on the TV show
``Sanford and Son'' and currently performs at a Las Vegas resort,
filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the
bankruptcy law in 1983. He owes the IRS more than $900,000 in
taxes, penalties and interest.
   The earnings on the recent movie were revealed as Foxx appeared
in court to try to block a public auction of more than 400 items of
personal property seized in an IRS raid in November.
   The items, including his Las Vegas home, several cars and
jewelry, were to be sold last month. The sale was delayed while a
federal judge tried to decide whether the IRS or the bankruptcy
court had first claim on the property.
   Bankruptcy Judge Clive Jones ordered the property seized by the
IRS to remain ``in limbo'' for 60 days while lawyers try to reach
agreement.
   Foxx failed in bids to block the IRS from seizing his paychecks
for back taxes.

   Dancer Judith Jamison told 60 children from 35
countries Friday that she achieved what she has by following the
advice of her parents _ to love life.
   Speaking at a Black History Month celebration at City Hall in
her honor, she said, ``You don't have to be a dancer, but enjoy
what you love to do and be committed to it.''
   The artistic director of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater
was given a proclamation by City Council President Andrew Stein who
said, ``She proves that with a dream _ and lots of hard work _ you
can be anything you want to be.''
   Ms. Jamison said her key to success was to do ``what my mom and
dad told me to do. `Love it. Dedicate yourself to it. Be committed
to it. Know where your gifts are coming from _ and, please, have a
sense of humor.''
   She said one way to grow in life is through dancing. ``That can
be your road map, a discipline you can take into any area of
responsibility,'' she said.
   ``You can study dance and be an architect ... a doctor ... a
dentist. Anything you wish. It opens up large, large areas of your
life _ of enjoyment, of being around people, of working for the
same goals,'' she said.
   The children attend a public school that specializes in teaching
children from abroad.

   On the campaign trail, President
Daniel Ortega comes across like a combination rock star, game show
host and evangelical politician.
   It is a dramatic change in image for a man so serious, so
earnest about his country, his revolution and his job that even
close friends say he can be boring.
   But behind the slick new facade still simmer the old class
resentments, the anger and the hunger that carried Ortega to the
pinnacle of Nicaraguan power.
   Ortega the candidate has swapped his trademark olive-drab
uniforms for flashy sports shirts and his owlish glasses for
contact lenses.
   He dances at campaign rallies with beauty queens and tosses
baseballs. He kisses babies and poses for photos. He presses flesh
and dispenses on-the-spot patronage with a boldness that could
shame even a seasoned Chicago pol.
   This new style reflects, in part, a man more confident of his
own hold on power and more comfortable with crowds than the
scruffy, strident young revolutionary who marched in Managua more
than a decade ago.
   But it is also the product of slick celebrity packaging.
   The Sandinista campaign sells Ortega, 44, the way Madison Avenue
pitches the latest youth-oriented commodity, emphasizing the
contrast with his main challenger, the white-haired publisher
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, 60.
   His picture adorns T-shirts, billboards and posters bearing
slogans such as ``Daniel, President of the Young'' or ``Daniel is
Love.''
   The image is one thing. The words are another.
   Ortega's rhetoric is harsh and his campaign speeches hammer on
the Sandinista's main challenger, the United National Opposition,
like a power drill.
   UNO, Ortega insists, is one and the same as the hated and feared
National Guard that defended Anastasio Somoza's dictatorship until
it fell in the 1979 revolution in which the Sandinistas took power.
   GN-UNO, he says, uniting the Spanish acronym for the long
defunct guard and the coalition, ``is death, is treason.''
   Its leaders, he says, represent the affluent class that put up
with the Somoza family dictatorship for 45 years, lining their
pockets in the process.
   He got so wound up in a recent speech that he threatened to
confiscate Mrs. Chamorro's house and turn it into a child center
and shut down her daily La Prensa, the only opposition newspaper in
Nicaragua.
   At moments like this, the tough, angry kid who was running
anti-military street gangs and marching in anti-Somoza
demonstrations when he was in his early teens shows through.
   His common-law wife of 12 years, the flamboyant poet Rosario
Murillo, told The Miami Herald recently that Ortega has never shed
his revolutionary asceticism.
   ``He's like a monk,'' said Murillo, who refuses to discuss
rumors they will split up after the election.
   Ortega grew up steeped in anti-American resentments forged by
the nearly continuous Marine occupation of Nicaragua between 1921
and 1933 and by the U.S. role in installing the Somoza family
dictatorship. Both parents served time in jail for anti-Somoza
activities.
   In an interview last year with The Associated Press, Ortega said
his greatest achievement in a decade of power was fending off U.S.
attempts to topple the Sandinista revolution.
   The cost of the war with U.S.-backed Contra rebels and the
economic embargo, he said, had been immense, but ``the reality is
that the revolution is here.''
   Ortega became a Sandinista when he was 18, leaving law school to
join the tiny, clandestine Marxist movement in 1963. By 1966, he
had had six months of guerrilla training in Cuba and was
masterminding bank robberies to raise money for the cause.
   By 1967, he was in prison for killing a National Guard officer,
lamenting in a now-famous poem that he never got to see Managua
when miniskirts were in style.
   He was freed after seven years when Sandinista commandos
kidnapped a group of prominent citizens. The hostages were traded
for 25 jailed Sandinistas who were flown to Cuba.
   Ortega came home from Cuba in 1975 and when Somoza fell in 1979,
he became head of the ruling junta that took over. He became
president in 1984 elections and rose to a dominant position in the
Sandinista leadership. That position is shored up by his brother
Humberto, who serves as defense minister.
   Mrs. Chamorro, the widow of Somoza's most outspoken critic,
Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, served with Ortega on the junta but
resigned after nine months. Later, she said the Sandinistas had
betrayed their promise of a pluralistic, democratic Nicaragua.
   Those old promises haunt Nicaragua, and should Ortega lose
Sunday's election, his word will be put to the test anew.
   ``Daniel Ortega could become a real historical figure if he were
to peacefully hand over power to Dona Violeta; he could go down in
the history of Latin American revolutionary movements,'' said
Alfredo Cesar, Mrs. Chamorro's chief strategist.
   ``We have lots of guys in Latin America who refuse to hand over
power. If he didn't he'd be just one more little dictator. But he
has a chance to make history.''
   Ortega shows no sign he plans to confront defeat.
   ``The people have already voted,'' he tells his audiences
confidently. ``I speak to you as the president-elect.''

   In an interview tape recorded just
hours after the nation's worst oil spill, tanker captain Joseph
Hazelwood denied drinking heavily, but said he had a ``phony beer''
on the ship and ``a real beer'' before he sailed.
   Hazelwood's interview with a state trooper the morning after his
ship ran aground was played for jurors in a hushed courtroom this
morning. His words were muffled because of the tape quality, but
jurors were given a typed transcript to follow along.
   Also today, the trooper heard on the tape, Michael Fox,
testified that he found more than 100 empty bottles of a brand of a
very-low-alcohol beer on the ship after the grounding.
   On the tape, Hazelwood described how the accident occurred and
was asked by Fox whether he had been consuming alcohol.
   ``Well, I had one of these phony beers, `Moussy,' and I'd been
ashore. I had lunch with Captain Murphy, drank iced tea,''
Hazelwood replied.
   The trooper asked whether Hazelwood had anything to drink before
going back to the ship. The skipper said he stopped to pick up
pizza for other crew members, and later had ``a beer with a piece
of pizza.''
   Hazelwood, of Huntington, N.Y., is charged with second-degree
criminal mischief, a felony; and three misdemeanors: reckless
endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent
discharge of oil.
   The Exxon Valdez leaked nearly 11 million gallons of Alaska
crude oil, blackening hundreds of miles of rocky coastline and
killing countless birds, fish and wildlife. Exxon has spent some $2
billion trying to clean up the mess.
   On the tape, Hazelwood was asked whether he stopped at any bars
in Valdez during his time ashore, and said, ``We went by the
Pipeline to see if anybody off the ship was in there, if we knew
anybody.'' But he said he drank nothing there.
   Several witnesses have testified that Hazelwood drank vodka at
the Pipeline Club that afternoon, but there is a dispute about how
much he drank and when.
   Earlier, Fox testified he found empty bottles of Moussy, a brand
of brew with 0.5 percent alcohol, on the Exxon Valdez when
authorities returned to search the tanker about a week after it ran
aground. There were ``a lot of them, over 100,'' he said.
   Fox said he went to the ship to look for evidence of hard liquor
in the captain's quarters, but didn't find any. He told jurors he
also went through ``a lot of trash _ it would fill this room.''
   A product like Moussy with a half-percent or less of alcohol is
categorized under the law as ``non-alcoholic''; in fact,
manufacturers are not even allowed to call the products beer but
must describe them as a ``brew.'' Regular beer has between 3.5 and
4 percent alcohol by volume.
   Other witnesses have said that the very-low-alcohol beer was
allowed aboard ships by Exxon, which forbids any other alcohol.
   On Thursday, Fox testified that he boarded the grounded Exxon
Valdez expecting to stop a drunken brawl and found instead a dark,
quiet ship where ``everyone was gazing out the windows.''
   ``They said the captain was drunk and they wanted me to take
care of it,'' Fox testified at Hazelwood's criminal trial in state
court. But when he met the skipper, he said, Hazelwood didn't seem
intoxicated.
   He said Hazelwood, 43, was napping when he arrived about four
hours after the tanker hit a reef. They met about an hour later for
the first time.
   ``I said, `Well, what the heck is the problem?''' Fox said, and
Hazelwood replied with his much-quoted comment, ``You're looking at
it.''
   The defense is expected to contend that the smell some witnesses
detected on Hazelwood's breath was the low alcohol beer and that he
drank it after the accident.
   Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Thomas Falkenstein testified Thursday that
he smelled alcohol on Hazelwood's breath when he met the skipper,
adding, ``It was an obvious smell.''
   But his testimony was challenged by Hazelwood lawyer Michael
Chalos who played for jurors a videotape of Falkenstein's remarks
on television.
   ``I never talked to him face-to-face like we're talking,'' he
told Connie Chung of CBS during an interview. ``It was side-by-side
and staring out at the pilot house across the deck. We were close,
2{ feet, and I smelled alcohol in and around the area.''
   The prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney Brent Cole, asked
whether anyone else was in the area when Falkenstein smelled
liquor. He answered no.
   Chalos asked whether the captain appeared impaired or
intoxicated.
   ``That was the first time I had met Capt. Hazelwood,'' said the
witness. ``I saw no signs of impairment.''
   Jurors also watched a section of the TV show in which
Falkenstein described Hazelwood's mood after the disaster.
   ``He was lucid but sullen like a man who'd seen his career go
down the tubes,'' Falkenstein said.

   A cat is avenging her species.
   Goldie, a tiger cat, is so tough she has every dog in the
neighborhood on the run. So her owner, Kenneth Mercure, posted a
sign soon after Goldie came to stay that warns: ``Dogs _ Beware Of
The Cat.''
   ``I was afraid she would attack a nice dog _ a valuable one _
and I don't want a lawsuit,'' said Mercure, 69.
   Mercure has seen wise dogs cross the street well before reaching
his house and cross back well after they've passed it, he said.
   ``Maybe the dogs can read the sign, I don't know,'' he said.
   Other dogs suffer for their ignorance. One hapless canine
followed a letter carrier into the yard and Goldie chased it away,
Mercure said.
   ``I guess he didn't get the hint because he came back,'' Mercure
said. ``She went around the side of the house and got him. He
doesn't follow the mailman anymore.''
   Goldie adopted the Mercures after her former owners moved out of
a nearby house and left her behind. Mercure guessed she was about 4
years old.
   Not all dogs attract Goldie's ire. Three small dogs live next
door and are quite friendly with the feline.
   ``They sometimes touch noses through the fence,'' he said.
   Terrorizing strange dogs, however, seems almost a mission.
   ``We've had lots of cats, but I've never seen a cat like her,''
Mercure said. ``I don't know why she's like this. Maybe she was
abused.''

   Young Violeta Barrios wanted to learn
to type and be a secretary when she grew up.
   Instead, she married a man who became one of Nicaragua's
revolutionary heroes, and as a steel gray-haired widow of 60 she
finds herself the political symbol at the center of an electoral
storm.
   Despite a rocky start, a broken knee and political naivete,
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro has run for president with gusto and a
common touch.
   She has managed, despite her handicaps, to lead the strongest
challenge to President Daniel Ortega and his leftist Sandinista
party in their 10 years of rule.
   ``I am nothing,'' Dona Violeta, as she is called even by Ortega,
said in an in interview. ``But in this life, you can learn
anything.''
   An elegant woman with graceful manners, Mrs. Chamorro's two main
strengths are her martyred husband and her lack of alignment with
any one political party.
   That was enough to qualify her as a candidate for the disparate
and fractious United National Opposition, a coalition of 14 parties
known as UNO.
   The memory of Pedro Joaquin Chamorro has been used by all sides,
even by Mrs. Chamorro's four children, two of whom support Ortega.
   ``My father's enemies are within UNO,'' wrote Mrs. Chamorro's
eldest daughter, Claudia. The phrase was used in Sandinista
campaign graffiti throughout Nicaragua.
   Mrs. Chamorro's late husband, whose father started what is today
Nicaragua's sole opposition newspaper, La Prensa, was shot down by
assassins in January 1978.
   The slaying, believed to have been ordered by dictator Anastasio
Somoza, ignited the popular revolt that brought the Sandinistas to
power in July 1979.
   Mrs. Chamorro, who still publishes La Prensa, became a member of
the junta that took over from Somoza but quit after nine months.
   She has bitter memories of what she considers the Sandinistas'
betrayal of her husband's democratic goals and her own faith in the
revolution.
   ``I'm not praising Somoza's government; it was horrible, but the
threats that I've had from the Sandinistas _ I never thought they
would repay me in that way,'' she said.
   Her pain as a widow, strong religous convictions and loyalty to
Chamorro's memory _ she pays weekly visits to his grave to leave
fresh flowers _ made her a symbol of dissatisfaction with the
Sandinistas. But there have been many drawbacks.
   Even after months of campaigning, she stumbled over speeches and
made baffling blunders. Last year, during a trip to Europe, she was
asked about UNO's government program.
   ``It's a secret,'' she replied.
   The Sandinistas have tried to paint Mrs. Chamorro as an
empty-headed figurehead; a pro-government newspaper runs a daily
column where nearly every joke portrays her as slow-witted.
   Perhaps responding to this, Mrs. Chamorro told a rally early in
the campaign, ``I am not a dummy.''
   One of her top advisers is her eldest son, Pedro Joaquin
Chamorro, who returned from exile in Miami, where he had been a
director of the U.S.-backed Contra rebels who tried to topple
Ortega's government by force.
   The son feared his mother would be manipulated by vice
presidential candidate Virgilio Godoy and top aide Alfredo Cesar,
two strong-willed politicians.
   Mrs. Chamorro, the eldest daughter of a landowning family, was
sent to U.S. finishing schools to learn English.
   ``I love math, I wanted to be a secretary, learn to type,'' Mrs.
Chamorro said.
   With her father's death in 1948, she returned to the family home
in the southern town of Rivas and married Chamorro.
   Her political awakening came after years of being a housewife
and mother.
   On one of the various occasions Chamorro was imprisoned by
Somoza, Mrs. Chamorro blew up at being kept in the dark.
   ``There had been something political and they threw him in
jail,'' Mrs. Chamorro said. ``I asked Pedro what was going on. Then
I told him, `Look, let's make a deal. From today on, you're going
to tell me all that's happening, so I won't be caught unaware.'''
   She has played the role of presidential candidate with gusto.
   Hampered by a cast on her fractured knee, she was at ease being
before crowds in her wheelchair under a sun tent in back of a
pickup truck.
   Beaming smiles at peasants, Dona Violeta was familiar and
neighborly, calling people ``papito'' and ``mamita.''
   ``I try to help, to do good things for the country,'' Mrs.
Chamorro said. ``I am what I am.''

   The White House was urged Friday to ``go
slow'' on normalizing relations with Nicaragua in the event of a
Sandinista victory, with two prominent observers citing the
possibility for fraud in Sunday's election.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., and Allen Weinstein, president of
the independent monitoring organization, the Center for Democracy,
said Nicaragua is using a teletype system to transmit voting
results that opens opportunities for the Sandinistas to engage in
fraud.
   Weinstein also complained that the leftist Sandinista government
has blocked delegations from Honduras and Costa Rica that were to
join the center's observation efforts at the Sunday election.
   In addition, Weinstein said the government has barred observers
from the center from going in and out of precincts to watch the
vote count; has denied visas for additional staff members in the
Center's Managua office and has denied visas for two dozen U.S.
Democratic and Republican political leaders to join its monitoring
operation.
   The center montored elections in Panama and the Philippines and
has been in Nicaragua since April at the invitation of both the
Sandinista government and the main political opposition group.
   Lugar was named by President Bush to head a bipartisan
congressional team of election observers, but Managua denied them
entry on the grounds that they represented a government that
supports the opposition.
   Lugar said he has ``no idea'' whether the election process has
been free and fair, and that he is ``not confident at all'' that
the monitoring process will be adequate to insure that outcome.
   ``The chain of observation has been broken'' because there will
not be monitoring of the transfer of voting results to teletype
centers that will relay them to Managua, he said.
   ``The president's got to make some tough decisions on what
occurs here,'' Lugar told reporters after he and Weinstein met with
Vice President Dan Quayle. ``My advice would be to go slow in the
process. We're going to have to sift out a good bit of what
occurs.''
   U.S. officials have said that if Ortega won a free and fair
election, the Bush administration would consider normalizing
relations with Managua, as long as other conditions are fulfilled
as well. Those include cessation of exporting arms to leftist
guerrillas in El Salvador and honoring human rights.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told a congressional
committee Thursday he would require a ``sustained period'' of
refraining from support for the Salvadoran rebels and would impose
stiff conditions before agreeing to normalized relations.
   Quayle on Friday said the administration ``will be paying very
close attention to the fairness of the election.'' He reiterated
administration criticisms of Nicaragua for denying visas to Bush's
observer delegation and other would-be observers.
   ``Obviously Daniel Ortega has been very selective on who he has
allowed into the country,'' Quayle told reporters. ``If you have a
viewpoint perhaps not entirely sympathetic to Daniel Ortega you are
denied entry into Nicaragua.''
   But he added, ``We will reserve judgment until all the
information is in.''
   Besides Weinstein's group, other observer teams allowed into
Nicaragua include one headed by former President Carter, and two
under the auspices of the United Nations and the Organization of
American States.
   Meanwhile, the executive committee of the Inter-American
Dialogue, a panel of prominent hemispheric leaders, called for
normalization of relations if Sunday's elections are honest.
   If there is an undisputed Sandinista victory, the panel said the
United States should assist in the repatriation and resettlement of
the Contra rebels, lift the U.S. trade embargo against Nicaragua
and join multilateral aid efforts.
   The group's co-director, former Ambassador Sol Linowitz, told a
news conference that if the election is not free and fair, ``this
calls for a wholly different approach.''
   On Capitol Hill, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said
the administration ``should find ways to recognize'' the new
government as long as, if Ortega wins, he shows commitment to
``maintaining the spirit of a free election and permitting the
normal, accepted political activities to continue in the country.''

<HEAD>Fat Substitute Is Better, But Don't Pig Out On It</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   First the good news: A creamy concoction that
lowers the fat in frozen desserts is healthier than ice cream
loaded with butterfat.
   But nutritionists warn that a fat substitute isn't a magic
elixir. It won't let consumers obsessed with diet and
weight-control indulge their sweet tooth free of worry.
   ``Don't get carried away thinking you can eat this stuff for
lunch. Fat-free ice cream is not a substitute for apples or
broccoli,'' said Bonnie Liebman, director of nutrition for the
Center for Science in the Public Interest.
   ``I want to make sure that people don't go overboard thinking
these new foods are nutritious,'' she said Friday. ``Basically,
we're talking about junk food without the fat. It's less harmful
than what it's replacing, but it's still junk food.''
   Simplesse, made from egg whites and milk, was spooned out
Thursday as the first fat substitute to win approval from the Food
and Drug Administration.
   NutraSweet Co., a subsidiary of Monsanto Co., plans to market it
in seven flavors of a frozen dessert called Simple Pleasures. A
4-ounce serving has 1 gram of fat and 120 calories, compared with 5
grams of fat and 130 calories in regular ice cream and 15 grams of
fat and 250 calories in super-premium ice creams such as
Haagen-Dazs.
   ``Simplesse means we can now enjoy all the rich, creamy taste of
foods ... without the fat, without the calories, without the worry
and without the guilt,'' said Robert Shapiro, NutraSweet's chairman
and chief executive.
   But experts are concerned that imitation ice cream with less fat
could encourage people to eat more portions or load up on other
foods high in fat rather than food with vitamins, minerals and
fiber.
   ``It sounds like the perfect answer, but it's not,'' said Marion
Nestle, professor of nutrition at New York University and managing
editor of the surgeon general's recent report on health and
nutrition.
   ``Putting a substance in ice cream doesn't address the
underlying issue: People don't eat enough fruits, vegetables and
grain,'' she said. ``I don't think this is going to reduce
America's dietary intake of fat. This isn't about nutrition. It's
about improving the financial health of Monsanto.''
   Financial experts predict Simplesse could fetch $500 million a
year for Monsanto. It cannot be used in frying or baking, however,
because it congeals at higher temperatures.
   Nutritionists say the new product might follow trends of
artificial sweeteners.
   They were touted as a way to reduce sugar consumption, but sugar
intake has increased to 132 pounds from 118 pounds per person per
year since 1975, and four times as many sugar substitutes were
consumed in the same time, according to the Center for Science in
the Public Interest.
   ``Will fat substitutes be a substitute for fat, or will people
just eat more double-scoop ice cream cones,'' said Lisa Lefferts, a
staff scientist for the public watchdog group.
   ``It's one step in the right direction, but it's only a step,''
said Dr. Scott Grundy, director of the Center for Human Nutrition
at the University of Texas.
   Fat tops every nutritionist's list of things to reduce in the
diet. Americans now get an average of 37 percent of their calories
from fats, and most experts recommend lowering that to no more than
30 percent.
   The surgeon general's report said its top priority is lowering
the intake of saturated fat from such foods as hamburgers, steak,
cheese, butter, pastries and french fries.
   Too much fat causes obesity, increases the risk of heart
diseases and may increase the risk of breast and colon cancers,
according to reports by the American Heart Association, the
American Cancer Society and the National Cholesterol Education
Program.
   ``Fat is the single worst thing about the average American's
diet,'' said Ms. Liebman. ``For the average person, you couldn't
possibly get too little fat if you tried.''

<HEAD>Security Stepped Up Amid Fears for Sunday Rallies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Interior Ministry said Friday it was placing
one-third more police on duty nationwide to keep order amid
widespread fears of violence at weekend street protests, but
organizers rejected an appeal to call off their ``peaceful February
revolution.''
   Teachers warned children to stay off Moscow streets on Sunday,
when the rallies are scheduled, and doctors who normally have the
day off were told to report to work, capital residents said.
   The official news agency Tass said meetings were held at Moscow
businesses Friday to emphasize the need to prevent destabilization.
   Rumors of impending violence swept the country in advance of
Sunday's planned pro-democracy rallies and counterdemonstrations,
but spokesmen for the Interior Ministry and KGB security police
said they had no reason to believe them. Some groups, however,
responded by canceling rallies.
   The nationwide demonstrations grew out of the success of a
protest Feb. 4, when tens of thousands of people paraded through
Moscow demanding the Communist Party give up its grip on power.
   Three days later, led by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the
party Central Committee voted to renounce its constitutional
monopoly on power, paving the way for a multiparty democracy.
   Organizers Yuri Afanasyev and Gavriil Popov, both
parliamentarians, said in leaflets distributed Friday on Moscow's
Pushkin Square that Sunday's rallies for ``radical democratic
changes'' are in line with public protests that have led to ousters
of more than a dozen local party chiefs nationwide.
   ``A peaceful February revolution, started by a
half-million-strong manifestation Feb. 4 in Moscow, is
continuing,'' the leaflets said.
   Sunday is the anniversary of the February Revolution, the 1917
popular uprising that drove Czar Nicolas II from the throne. For
many Russian progressives opposed to the Communist Party, it marks
the short-lived triumph of Russian democracy, since the Bolsheviks
seized power eight months later.
   Andrei Protsenko of the People's Front in the southern Russian
city of Rostov-on-Don said his group had planned a rally Sunday but
authorities outlawed it. The group decided to cancel because it
feared government provocations and being blamed for any violence,
he said.
   Leningrad People's Front leaders said they would not take part
in an officially sanctioned rally Sunday because they also feared
provocations, either from the government or right-wing groups
dominated by Russian nationalists who favor orthodox Communism.
   In Azerbaijan, where a state of emergency was imposed following
bloody ethnic attacks on Armenians and an army assault to dislodge
nationalists from the capital of Baku, Yusis Samed Oglu of the
People's Front said no rallies were planned out of fear that
soldiers would use force.
   The Soviet Interior Ministry, which includes riot squads and
police, has canceled days off Sunday for many of its workers and
17,000 of them will be on duty in Moscow alone, said spokesman
Arkady Bronin.
   He estimated that nationwide, one-third more Interior Ministry
workers than normal will be on duty. He did not have the total
figure.
   The government launched a massive campaign to head off trouble.
   State-run media throughout the day repeated a Communist Party
appeal for Soviets to avoid ``chaos'' during the rallies, and two
members of the ruling Politburo spoke out.
   In a special prime-time TV broadcast, Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov
said the government understood the people's frustrations because
``they can't live normally,'' but emphasized law and order were
vital.
   ``We are not only concerned but we are taking, and will take,
very strict measures to keep order in the limits of the law.
Everyone must answer in accordance with the law,'' Ryzhkov said.
   The Cabinet that Ryzhkov heads, the Council of Ministers, issued
an order instructing police and governing bodies to prevent
``extremist and criminal elements'' from provoking disorder.
   Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev told the government daily
Izvestia that rallies were not the way to press for change.
   ``To elect authority on the streets is not democracy but
arbitrary rule, ignoring the people,'' Yakovlev said.
   Afanasyev told a news conference the Sunday rally in Moscow was
designed to broaden democracy. The organizers rejected an appeal
from creative labor unions that urged the rallies be canceled
because of potential danger.
   ``The situation is very tense, and any skirmish, any street
incident might lead to unpredictable consequences,'' the unions
said in a statement read at a news conference by Elem Klimov, head
of the Filmworkers Union.
   The statement said citizens should voice their opinions not at
rallies but at the polls. Elections to republican Supreme Soviet
legislatures are scheduled March 4 in the Russian federation, the
Ukraine and Byelorussia, and will be held Saturday in Lithuania.
   Officials of Moscow's Frunze district told administrators of one
school to warn children to stay off the streets Sunday, and a
doctor at Moscow's Children's Clinic No. 3 said all staff were told
to report to work Sunday, residents said.
   ``Chronicle,'' a newsletter posted in a Moscow pedestrian
underpass, said the KGB was bracing for an attack Sunday on its
headquarters. Asked about the report, KGB spokesman Sergei Zakatov
laughed.
   He said he was aware of rumors of trouble but that ``it's too
early to speak about a danger to state security because it depends
upon the streets on Sunday.''

<HEAD>Air Force Secretary Calls Unflattering Report `Hypercritical'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air Force Secretary Donald Rice said in a
letter released Friday that a congressional report contending his
service had grossly understated the costs of major weapons was
``hypercritical and inflammatory.''
   ``The ... report offers a narrow, CPA's view of the information
needed for defense decision-making that has limited relationship to
the real problems of defense management,'' Rice said in an angry
three-page letter to the head of the General Accounting Office,
Charles Bowsher.
   For his part, Bowsher told a Senate committee Friday that the
Air Force's accounting system fails to provide accurate cost data
for almost 80 percent of its weapons, inventory and equipment.
   ``We roughly estimate that equipment and missiles are misstated
by billions of dollars and aircraft and inventories are misstated
by tens of billions of dollars,'' he told the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee.
   Bowsher testified as the GAO released its 109-page audit of the
Air Force's accounting and financial management system. The
Associated Press and other news organizations had reported the
GAO's findings Thursday based on a draft of the report.
   Testifying at the hearing, called after the draft became public,
Bowsher said the Air Force has resources totaling about $275
billion and receives about $90 billion in annual appropriations.
   The GAO concluded that the Air Force had understated the cost of
the B-1 bomber by $7.1 billion, the F-15 fighter by $6.8 billion
and the F-16 fighter by $6.3 billion.
   In addition, the Air Force made billions of dollars in
adjustments that could not be explained or supported by the service
officials, the GAO said.
   In one instance, the Air Force tinkered with its accounts when
the balance for the Space Systems Division differed from other
records by $2.4 billion, making the change without determining why
the records did not agree.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio and chairman of the panel, noted that
the GAO chose to audit the Air Force because it is the only armed
service to develop financial statements that are in accord with
accounting practices elsewhere in the federal government.
   ``If the Air Force does indeed have the best financial
management system among the services, then the audit results are an
indictment of the financial management systems of the whole
Department of Defense _ the Army, the Navy, as well as the Air
Force,'' Glenn said.
   The Ohio Democrat also used the hearing to question Bowsher
about Rice's previously unreleased Feb. 15 letter to him.
   Although the Defense Department, in its official response to the
GAO report, concurred wholly or in part with all 26 recommendations
in the audit, Rice was highly critical of the report.
   The Air Force secretary wrote that the service volunteered to
work with the GAO on the audit and ``in return, the GAO writes a
hypercritical and inflammatory report.''
   ``I urge you to send your team back to the drawing board with
instructions to prepare a report that fairly evaluates the pros and
cons of GAO's approach and which uses Air Force data only as a test
case for a new approach,'' Rice said.
   Asked about Rice's complaint, Bowsher said his agency audited
the Air Force using a financial system for federal agencies agreed
upon in 1986 by himself, former Treasury Secretary James Baker III
and former White House budget director James Miller.
   Rice also argued in his letter that even if the type of
financial information from standard accounting systems were useful,
``Why do I need it at a penny-wise level of accuracy that a CPA
would judge `auditable?'''
   Bowsher responded:
   ``We're not talking about penny accuracy. We're talking about
billions of dollars of errors.''

<HEAD>Accord Reached in Lawsuit Over Art Museum Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One group of Occidental Petroleum Corp.
shareholders has settled a dispute with the company over the use of
$86 million in Occidental funds to build Chairman Armand Hammer's
art museum.
   But another group will oppose the proposed settlement of a
class-action lawsuit when it comes up for approval by Vice
Chancellor Maurice Hartnett of the Delaware Chancery Court on April
4.
   The shareholders have opposed Occidental's support for the
Armand Hammer Museum and Cultural Center, which is being built
beside the company's headquarters in the Westwood section of Los
Angeles.
   Hammer, 91, decided in 1987 to build the museum after a falling
out with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art over its plans for
his collection.
   The proposed deal allows Occidental to spend $86 million to
build and run the museum.
   But it limits other spending on the project, puts some limits on
Occidental contributions to Hammer-related charities, grants $1.4
million in fees to the plaintiffs' lawyers and ensures that
Occidental's name as well as Hammer's will appear on the museum.
   ``We don't think it is fair, reasonable or adequate,'' said
Deputy California Attorney General Susan Henrichsen, the attorney
for California's huge public employee pension fund, part of the
shareholders group that plans to object to the deal.
   That group filed a separate, similar class-action lawsuit last
year to force Occidental to sell the museum.

<HEAD>Justice Department to Appeal Ruling Supporting Flag-Burning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department said Friday it will ask
the Supreme Court to overrule a federal judge's finding that a law
banning flag burning is unconstitutional.
   Spokesman David Runkel said Justice Department attorneys would
file a notice in Seattle federal court of the government's plan to
appeal Wednesday's ruling by U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein.
   The judge dismissed criminal charges against four people arising
from a flag-burning incident, saying the law passed last year by
Congress violated constitutional free-speech protections.
   Congress enacted the law after the high court last year threw
out a similar Texas statute on the same constitutional ground.
   President Bush proposed a constitutional amendment to ban flag
burning but allowed the bill passed by Congress without signing it.
   Despite the administration's preference for a constitutional
amendment, the Justice Department has a duty to defend the law,
Runkel said.
   David Cole, an attorney for the Center for Constitutional Rights
who argued the Seattle case, predicted the high court would not
overturn Rothstein's ruling.
   ``I believe the Supreme Court will reaffirm that the principles
for which the flag stands includes the freedom to dissent and will
therefore uphold Judge Rothstein's ruling,'' Cole said.
   The law provides for direct appeal of rulings on its
constitutionality from federal district court to the Supreme Court.
   The prospect of another Supreme Court ruling has renewed calls
in Congress for a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning.
   ``This decision vindicates those of us who wanted to fix this
thing and have the states take up the question of protecting the
flag properly,'' said Rep. Chuck Douglas, R-N.H. ``The way to do it
is by a constitutional amendment, and there is nothing short of
that.''

   President Bush went to the national

   In a speech to Red Cross employees, he noted that the service
organization had an especially busy year. He praised it for
mobilizing disaster relief for Hurricane Hugo and the Northern
California earthquake last fall and for providing emergency food,
clothing and medical aid to new refugees in Eastern Europe.
   Bush called the Red Cross ``a star of hope across the globe''
that has cast ``a glow of love and caring.''
   ``For 109 years that star has shone anytime there has been a
need, anywhere there is a need. And today, it dazzles still,'' he
said.
   And, on a more lighthearted note, Bush told his audience: ``What
a pleasure to address the Red Cross. One reason is that if my
speech is a disaster, relief is close at hand.''

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department said Friday that any
settlement with Exxon Corp. over possible criminal charges from the
Alaskan oil spill won't compromise civil claims by the state or its
citizens.
   Spokesman David Runkel delivered a statement in response to
criticism from environmentalists and Alaskan officials that the
department was trying to force the state to go along with what it
considered an inadequate settlement of the federal case.
   ``There are a number of complicated legal and factual issues
involved in this matter and we are puzzled by comments which have
been reported by persons who appear to have little grasp of what is
actually involved in this case,'' Runkel said.
   An early draft of a possible settlement called for Exxon to pay
up to $500 million to finance a natural resources restoration
program over the next seven years, according to sources familiar
with the negotiations.
   But U.S. government sources, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, stressed that there was no agreement with Exxon,
although discussions were continuing with attorneys for the oil
company.
   The department is seeking an agreement under which Exxon would
be assessed for additional cleanup costs if expenses exceed those
in the original estimate, said one source.
   A resolution in the discussions, which have been going on for
several months, is expected soon, according to the
environmentalists and the state officials.
   A federal grand jury is meeting in Alaska in connection with the
investigation by the department's environmental crimes section.
   The grand jury could conceivably return an indictment if the
Justice Department and Exxon do not reach a settlement of the case.
   Federal criminal laws in oil spill cases provide for fines up to
double the cost of a cleanup. Exxon has spent nearly $2 billion to
clean up the oil spill, according to Transportation Secretary
Samuel Skinner.
   On Thursday, Alaska's attorney general, Douglas Baily, accused
the Justice Department of trying to force the state to make a
``hasty endorsement'' of the draft proposal.
   ``Under the proposed agreement, the federal government would
abandon its commitment to Alaska to assist with its civil claims
against Exxon,'' Baily told reporters. ``We are being asked to
accept a pig in a poke. ... And that pig smells awfully bad.''
   Similar criticism was voiced by representatives of environmental
groups, who charged that the Justice Department was prepared to let
Exxon off easy for the massive oil spill when the tanker Exxon
Valdez ran aground in Prince William Sound.
   Runkel declined to discuss the specifics of the negotiations,
beyond stating, ``There have been discussions with attorneys for
Exxon as to the admissable parameters of appropriate penalties and
appropriate corrective measures in the even of a guilty plea to any
criminal charges that might be brought.''
   ``No actions taken by the federal government in the enforcement
of federal criminal laws will compromise the state of Alaska's
ability to pursue violations of its criminal laws or appropriate
civil remedies,'' Runkel said.
   He also rebutted criticism that any settlement would impair the
ability of ``environemntal groups and Alaska residents to pursue
appropriate civil claims.''

<TEXT>
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat said in a letter
released Friday by a Jewish group that his organization would
support peace talks with Israel involving Palestinians from the
occupied territories.
   It was believed to be the first time Arafat has approved of such
talks. In his letter, Arafat also repeated the PLO's demand for a
separate state and for full participation in all peace talks, which
Israel rejects.
   ``The PLO once more leaned over backward and approved the idea
of a dialogue between representatives of the Israeli government and
representatives of the Palestinian people in the occupied
territories and the diaspora,'' said the letter, which was sent to
a meeting of Jewish activists called the Special Emergency World
Jewish Leadership Peace Conference.
   Rita Hauser, an attorney and the head of the center's American
branch, said the six-page letter was received ``through a
circuitous manner, via fax'' on Thursday, but that conference
leaders chose not to publicize it until Friday.
   Avi Pazner, an aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said the
letter would not influence Israel.
   ``We are absolutely not interested in what Arafat's position
is,'' he said. ``We want to go forward with the peace process, not
with Arafat, but without Arafat.''
   Pazner accused the Palestine Liberation Organization of trying
to ``insert itself through the side door'' to gain entry to peace
talks while Foreign Minister Moshe Arens was out of the country.
   Arens, whose right-wing Likud bloc has ruled out PLO
participation in talks, met in Washington on Friday with Secretary
of State James A. Baker III to discuss ways of restarting the
Middle East peace process.
   Baker has been trying for months to arrange a three-way meeting
with Arens and Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid to
decide on the composition of a Palestinian delegation to
preliminary peace talks. Friday's meeting with Arens failed to
accomplish that, Baker said.
   In his letter, Arafat said peace talks would have to be part of
a process ``aimed at a comprehensive and final settlement'' of the
Palestinian situation and that the agenda ``could cover all the
conceptual ingredients of that process.''
   ``We remain deeply convinced that the only real security
guarantee for Isael lies in a peaceful settlement based on the
termination of the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian and Arab
territories and the acceptance of the two-state principle,'' he
wrote.
   Arafat noted that Israelis have been fearful of dealing with the
PLO and said Palestinians have similar concerns.
   ``Watching the convoluted maneuvers the Israeli government has
engaged in and the massive obstacles with which it had littered the
path to peace, the Palestinian people are not filled with
confidence in the good intentions of the Israeli leaders,'' Arafat
wrote.
   ``To them, the only guarantee of their own security and their
political future lies in the full participation of the PLO in all
stages of the peace process,'' he said.
   The preliminary talks Baker has tried to set up would be to
clear the way for Israeli-proposed elections in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. The elections would give limited automony to the 1.7
million Palestinian residents of the territories.
   Efforts to get the talks under way have been stalled by Israel's
concerns over the makeup of the Palestinian delegation and the
agenda. The Israeli government wants the agenda limited to the
election plan.
   Pressure has been increasing on Likud to accept some compromises
to get the talks started.
   The left-leaning Labor Party demanded the Cabinet agree to a
Palestinian delegation that would include some deportees. Likud
opposes having deportees in the delegation.
   On Thursday, Likud threatened to leave the coalition government
if the compromise was not accepted.
   The letter was dated Feb. 17 and came from Tunis, where the PLO
is based. There was no explanation for the delay in its
transmission to Jerusalem.
   Ms. Hauser met with Arafat in Stockholm in December 1988.
Shortly after that, Arafat made a series of historic announcements
in which he recognized Israel's right to exist and renounced
terrorism.
   Those statements led to the opening of a dialogue between the
United States and the PLO.

<HEAD>Prime Minister to Form New Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Caretaker Prime Minister Ingvar
Carlsson said Friday he is forming a new government to end Sweden's
political crisis and quell the labor strife and inflation that have
beset the economy.
   Carlsson said the government would consider opening Sweden to
workers from the Soviet Baltic republics to alleviate an
inflation-boosting labor shortage and would seek to mediate labor
disputes.
   Carlsson's Cabinet resigned Feb. 14 when the legislature
rejected his emergency economic program. He was asked to form a new
government Thursday after the centrist opposition parties failed to
unite on a common policy.
   Thage G. Peterson, the speaker of parliament, informed the
349-member Riksdag that he had asked Carlsson to lead another
Cabinet.
   ``I hereby propose to parliament to appoint as prime minister
Ingvar Carlsson, who intends to form a government of members of the
Social Democratic Party,'' Peterson said, immediately adjourning
the session.
   A vote on the new Carlsson government was set for Monday, with
the small Communist Party expected to support it and the Center
Party to abstain. The new Cabinet would be installed Tuesday,
Swedish radio said.
   The program Carlsson outlined shifted the government's attack on
economic problems from greater regulation to liberalizing the labor
market.
   ``This is a proposal of measures of how we shall conduct a sound
economic policy, ... take responsibility for the nation and quickly
solve the crisis,'' Carlsson said.
   The platform dropped a controversial proposal for a two-year
wage freeze and for compulsory arbitration of labor disputes, while
it maintained a price freeze for an indefinite period.
   It included a proposal to appoint a state mediator whose task
would be to dampen wage demands in a national agreement to be
negotiated this spring. The government also would tighten rules to
prevent wildcat strikes.
   The political crisis began in January with a series of labor
conflicts that closed all banks for three weeks and threatened to
paralyze public services and transport in major cities. The
government said the labor strife was symptomatic of pressures that
had caused a wage-cost spiral.
   Some economists have blamed Sweden's full employment policy,
which has limited unemployment to about 1 percent, for fueling
inflation approaching 9 percent, or twice that of most of its
trading partners.
   To offset the labor shortage, Carlsson said the government will
investigate whether young workers from the Soviet Baltic republics
will be given the opportunity to work in Sweden.
   It also would give Swedes the choice of working two years beyond
the retirement age at 65, and working through two of the six-weeks
vacation to which each Swedish worker will entitled by law as of
next year.

<TEXT>
   About 30 young men turned in their
military identification cards in the Lithuanian capital Friday and
in Moldavia youths burned a military uniform in protests on Soviet
Army Day.
   The demonstrations reflected the anger at the Soviet military
that has surfaced in outlying republics that were incorporated into
the Soviet Union in 1940. The national holiday marks the 72nd
anniversary of the Red Army.
   In Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, the youths turned in their
I.D. cards to a nationalist group, saying they refused to serve in
an ``occupation army.''
   Lithuania is trying to secede from the Soviet Union and on
Saturday holds parliamentary elections aimed at opening
negotiations with the Kremlin for full independence.
   The young men filled out declarations in Lithuanian and Russian
saying the 1940 Red Army occupation of their country was illegal
and therefore under the Geneva convention they had no obligation to
serve.
   The demonstration was peaceful, with no interference by police.
There were about 150 onlookers.
   ``What do we need an army for?'' asked one of the young men,
Janavicus Vidmant.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said an official Soviet
Army Day celebration in the Moldavian capital, Kishinev, was
accompanied by an unsanctioned protest. A group of ``extremist-bent
youth'' carried anti-Soviet signs and chanted anti-army slogans in
a march through the city, Tass said.
   They picketed a military garrison and then went to Kishinev's
central square, where they burned an officer's uniform and military
identification cards, Tass said.

<HEAD>Crown Prince Celebrates Birthday Bash, But Still No Bride</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of friends attended a birthday bash for
Japan's Crown Prince Naruhito, who turned 30 on Friday, but one
guest was prominently absent _ a royal bride.
   According to the prince, there might not be one by his side for
some time to come.
   ``I may have met my ideal woman, and I may not have,'' he coyly
told reporters. ``That's all I have to say.''
   Four years ago, Naruhito, the eldest son of Emperor Akihito and
first in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne, said he hoped to marry
by the age of 30.
   The comment has haunted him since, and has created intense
competition in Japan's media to be the first to name the bride.
   The 30 deadline also put pressure on palace officials, who have
said they would like to see the prince wed as soon as possible, but
who are having trouble helping him find a suitable mate.
   Even so, in a pre-birthday news conference earlier this week,
the prince said he doesn't feel rushed.
   ``I know how to operate a washing machine without getting
covered in bubbles, and I know how to handle an iron,'' said
Naruhito, who is preparing to set up his own residence at the
Akasaka Palace in downtown Tokyo. Aside from two years at Oxford,
the prince has lived most of his life with his parents.
   ``I will be going about it at my own pace, without hurry,'' he
said, adding, ``I don't feel guilty (about being single).''
   Excerpts of the conference were broadcast Friday on major TV
networks and carried in most newspapers. Foreign reporters were not
invited.
   Speculation about Naruhito intensified when it was announced in
August that his younger brother, Prince Aya, had already proposed
to Kiko Kawashima, a 23-year-old graduate student with no royal
background.
   Many palace conservatives resisted the idea of Aya, 24, marrying
before his brother, and palace watchers wondered if Naruhito was
not going to surprise them with an announcement of his own.
   But with Aya's wedding scheduled for late June, and a series of
coronation celebrations planned for November, it is now believed
that Naruhito won't be able to marry until sometime next year.
   During the news conference, Naruhito stressed he wants to choose
his own spouse, although his wedding won't be an entirely private
matter.
   Under Japanese law, male members of the royal family must
receive government approval before getting married, and palace
officials generally make up a list of princess candidates.
   Noble descent was a must until Naruhito's father wed Empress
Michiko, the daughter of a wealthy businessman.
   ``It is not a question of what her position is, but rather what
kind of person she is,'' Naruhito said when asked if he, too, would
consider a commoner. ``Her ability to adapt to the palace does not
depend on her background.''
   Naruhito said his position has made the search difficult, as he
is not able to pick and choose freely. The demands of life in
Japan's often secluded, tradition-conscious palace are also enough
to scare many women away.
   The prince said he has not lost hope. ``I want to decide for
myself ... I am not at all pessimistic.''

<HEAD>U.S. Business Group Heading to Panama</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush met Friday with a group of U.S.
business executives who are heading to Panama to help revive the
Central American nation's wrecked economy.
   The group, which leaves for Panama City on Saturday, hopes to
develop contacts between U.S. and Panamanian business interests in
a variety of areas.
   Panama is suffering from years of corruption under deposed
dictator Gen Manuel Antonio Noriega, along with two years of U.S.
economic sanctions against the Noriega government and the
devastation of the U.S. invasion last Dec. 20.
   ``It looks to us like we can get that place going in a hurry,''
said Fred Zeder, president of the Overseas Private Investment Corp.
``We're looking forward to a quick start-up down there.''
   OPIC is federally-owned agency that sells insurance to Americans
investing overseas.
   Zeder is leading a group of 26 business people who want to do
business in Panama. Among them are representatives of American
Express, AT&amp;T and GTE Spacenet International.
   Bush's former chief of staff, Craig Fuller, is going as a
representative of Strategic Resources Corp., which wants to set up
an investment fund.
   Fuller said the Panamanians told the group that among their
chief economic needs are the port of Panama City where equipment is
needed for rebuilding, the health care system that was gutted by
Noriega's regime, and telecommunications.
   He said the Japanese and South Koreans already have been laying
groundwork for business opportunities there, so American firms will
face competition.
   ``We're looking for new opportunities, growth opportunities,''
Lamont Godwin of American Express told reporters outside the White
House after their closed meeting with Bush.
   ``We want to know what has changed'' since the ouster of
Noriega, he said.
   Zeder said Panama's economy is ``like an automobile that's been
left out to rust,'' during the Noriega years.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens failed Friday to arrange an
opening round of Mideast peace negotiations, but left the
impression of eventual success.
   ``It was a very constructive and hopefully a very productive
meeting,'' Baker said after talking to Arens for 90 minutes.
   Arens agreed, saying ``we had a good, constructive
conversation.'' He then flew to New York, planning to go on to
Jerusalem on Saturday at the end of the Jewish Sabbath. He will
brief Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and the Israeli Cabinet on
Sunday.
   On Monday, Arens is due in Warsaw to oversee a resumption of
diplomatic relations with Poland after a 23-year lapse.
   The positive statements by Baker and Arens indicated they had
made some headway to negotiations, with the next move up to the
Israeli Cabinet.
   But when Baker was asked if he had been able to set up a
three-way meeting with Arens and Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat
Abdel-Meguid _ the first step in a drawn-out U.S. plan for
negotiations _ he replied:
   ``No, we have not agreed today on the timetable for a trilateral
meeting.''
   Baker told Arens about his talks in Moscow with Soviet officials
on two issues of keen interest to Jerusalem: rising anti-Semitism
and Soviet unwillingness to implement an agreement for direct
Aeroflot flights of Jewish refugees to Tel Aviv.
   Arens said he had thanked Baker for his efforts.
   Their meeting was held against a backdrop of U.S. impatience and
mounting political pressure in Israel for concessions.
   Israel's majority Likud Party, of which Arens is a senior
member, is under pressure from the minority Labor Party to accept
an Egyptian formula for starting the talks or face dissolution of
the coalition government in Jerusalem.
   The chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Yasser
Arafat, said, meanwhile, in a letter released by peace activists in
Jerusalem that he had approved the composition of a Palestinian
delegation that would include delegates from the West Bank and Gaza.
   Baker has tried for months to arrange a three-way session here
with Arens and Abdel-Meguid. It would be followed by talks between
Israel and Palestinians in Cairo.

   Former Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon
Duarte brought ``a message of hope'' to all of Latin America, the
White House said in a statement Friday.
   Durate died Friday after a two-year battle with cancer.
   ``President Duarte was the father of Salvadoran democracy, a
dedicated servant to the people of El Salvador and a firm friend of
the United States,'' the White House said in a statement issued by
presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``His wisdom and dedication to the growth of democracy in
Central America will be long remembered. President Duarte was also
a strong supporter and exponent on behalf of human rights and
social justice and has left a strong legacy in this area.''
   President Bush and his wife, Barbara, ``are deeply saddened'' by
the death, the statement said, noting that Bush and Duarte
``enjoyed a warm, close working relationship.''
   Bush visited Duarte last fall when the former Salvadoran
president was at Walter Reed Army Medical Center here for treatment.
   Deputy White House press secretary Alixe Glen said it had not
been decided who would represent the United States at Duarte's
funeral.
   Bush admired ``the courage he (Duarte) exhibited in building the
foundation of democracy in El Salvador and the message of hope he
brought to all of Central America,'' the statement said.
   ``The American people join the people of El Salvador in mourning
their loss.''

<HEAD>USDA Says Soviets Can Buy Another Million Tons of Wheat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union will be able to buy an
additional 1 million metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized
prices, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Undersecretary Richard T. Crowder said the wheat will be made
available under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or
EEP. The new amount is in addition to 12,950 tons Moscow had
remaining under a previous allocation announced Dec. 19.
   The Soviet Union is committed to buy minimum quantities of wheat
and corn under a long-term grain agreement, which began its seventh
year on Oct. 1 and will expire Dec. 31. Moscow has bought nearly
2.8 million tons of wheat for delivery in 1989-90, according to
USDA records.
   Nearly 11 million tons of corn have been sold for 1989-90
delivery, along with soybeans and soybean meal.
   In 1988-89, the sixth under the agreement, the Soviet Union
bought about 5.4 million tons of wheat and more than 16.3 million
tons of corn, plus soybeans, soybean meal and grain sorghums.
   A metric tons is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Since EEP began in 1985, more than $2.69 billion in subsidies
has been paid to exporters to ship a variety of commodities to
overseas customers. As of Feb. 22, sales totaled 92.7 million tons
of grain, including 69.7 million tons of wheat.
   The Soviet Union, as the largest EEP beneficiary, has bought
more than 20.3 million tons of wheat. China is second at 14.2
million tons of wheat.

<TEXT>
   A Hutchinson, Kan., company has issued a
nationwide recall of approximately 106,000 pounds of frozen pork
pizza topping because it may contain light bulb fragments, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   The product was made by Doskocil Sausage Co. and was sold
exclusively to food service facilities, including restaurants and
carryouts, the department said. It is not available in packages
sold directly to consumers.
   Products include ``Leprino Foods Pizza Topping Mix'' with the
code NOV13891131, and ``Pizzano Cooked Italian Style Pizza
Topping'' with a code of NOV13891548 or NOV20891548.
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service said both products were shipped in
cartons containing five-pound bags. The establishment number 623
was stamped on the cartons and bags.
   Crawford said distributors and food service operators who have
any of the suspected products should return them to suppliers.
   The company began the recall after receiving four complaints,
one on Jan. 15 and three on Feb. 13, about broken glass in pizza
topping, Crawford said. There have been no reports of contaminated
products being consumed.
   Jim Greene, an agency spokesman, said the products went to some
60 distributors ``from California to Pennsylvania'' but that he
didn't have any further details on locations.
   Consumers with questions about the recall were advised to call
the USDA's toll-free meat and poultry hotline at 1-800-535-4555,
which operates from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. EST Monday through Friday.

   The daughters of Thomas Sutherland,
who has been held hostage in Lebanon since 1985, will take
petitions signed by 18,000 Colorado residents to the United Nations
on Monday.
   Kit and Joan Sutherland have been told they can meet for about
15 minutes Monday with U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, said Anne Stoddard, spokeswoman for the U.S. mission at
the United Nations.
   The petitions call on the international body to intervene in
seeking the release of Sutherland, who was on leave from Colorado
State University and acting as dean of agriculture at the American
University of Beirut when he was abducted by gunmen on June 9, 1985.
   ``We're very excited about it,'' Kit Sutherland said of the New
York visit. ``We're looking forward to showing the U.N. that there
are still people who are concerned.''
   Wil Huett, a radio talk-show host who led the petition drive,
said it had yielded 18,015 signatures.
   The petition was drafted by University of Denver International
Law School professor Ved Nanda and some of his students. Nanda said
he expects the document to be forwarded to the U.N.'s Commission on
Human Rights, which is meeting in Geneva.
   The petition may serve to ``remind'' Perez de Cuellar of a
promise to use his office in an effort to free hostages held in
Lebanon, Nanda said.
   Most of the 18 Westerners held hostage in Lebanon are believed
in the hands of extremist Shiite Moslem factions. Eight are
Americans; the longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was abducted March 16,
1985.

   The red carpet is out for sympathetic
celebrities invited to observe the general election, but on Friday
observers from the most conservative group still were waiting for
visas from the leftist Sandinista government.
   The Washington-based Center for Democracy, which acted for the
U.S. Senate in observing the 1986 Philippines elections and the
1989 Panamanian elections, says it has become an outsider in the
monitoring process.
   Insiders include people like actor Ed Asner, a longtime critic
of U.S. policy in Central America, and British singer Billy Bragg,
whose latest album is ``Workers' Paradise.''
   ``It would be our job, if we were satisfied with the results and
the procedure, to go back and do our best to counteract the
negative media that continually occurs vis-a-vis the Sandinistas in
the United States,'' Asner said as he trotted toward a bus in the
sweltering afternoon heat.
   Asner, a former president of the Screen Actors' Guild; Bragg,
singer Jackson Browne and actor Robert Foxworth had just finished
an hourlong meeting with Vice President Sergio Ramirez and were
late for a meeting with the interior minister.
   But Allen Weinstein, president of the Center for Democracy,
could only gaze out his window across the street to the Foreign
Ministry, which hasn't issued visas for 25 Americans on the
center's team.
   The center learned Thursday that visas for three Costa Rican
congressmen in its delegation had been denied.
   ``There they are, right across the street. But they won't answer
our calls, they won't answer our letters,'' Weinstein said.
   Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mercedes Borge said the ministry
didn't know anything about the visas and referred inquiries to the
Supreme Electoral Council. The council spokesman was not available
for comment, a secretary said by telephone.
   Weinstein has issued a statement saying the ``integrity of the
entire international observer process'' has been jeopardized by the
visa problems and electoral council refusal to let his observers
watch the votes being counted.
   He had been hoping to field 100 observers but will end up with
fewer than 30.
   Sunday's election will still be one of the most closely watched
in history, with one observer for about every 850 voters.
   Every morning, hordes of observers spill out of the doors of the
Intercontinental Hotel, a pyramid-shaped Managua landmark. They
clog restaurants and roam the aisles of the dollar store, virtually
the only place in Nicaragua for supermarket-style provisions,
Ray-Bans and Reeboks.
   The Sandinistas expect a favorable verdict from voters and count
on the observers to give the election a credibility the Bush
administration cannot ignore.
   President Daniel Ortega, whose main challenger is publisher
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, says he will propose a political truce
with the opposition and the United States, which has financed the
Contra rebels and kept an economic embargo on Nicaragua.
   The government has worked closely with the three main observer
missions: the United Nations, the Organization of American States
and former President Jimmy Carter's Council of Freely Elected Heads
of Government. The three will deploy more than 700 people in all
and they will issue the definitive verdicts on the election.
   All three groups have said they believe conditions exist for a
free and fair election.
   The Center for Democracy was one of the first groups invited
here and has been monitoring the campaign since last fall, as have
the three major observer groups.
   But things went sour when it blamed the Sandinistas for a riot
after an opposition rally in Masatepe in December in which one
person died and scores were injured. The center issued a critical
report, then held a news conference during a Central American
summit in Costa Rica.
   Weinstein flew back to Washington and told reporters there
Friday the White House should go slow on normalizing relations with
Nicaragua in the event of a Sandinista victory. Among his charges:
that Nicaragua is using a teletype system to transmit voting
results that opens opportunities for Sandinista fraud.
   The vast majority of the smaller observer groups are either
critical of U.S. policy in Central America, sympathetic to the
Sandinistas or both.
   The U.S.-based Veterans for Peace, for example, will have 59
observers, more than Carter's group. Accredited observers also are
here from pro-Sandinista solidarity groups, leftist parties, labor
groups and pacifist organizations.
   Other observers include those from national election tribunals
in Central and South America, universities, embassies, parliaments
and religious organizations.
   The Supreme Electoral Council has accredited 2,000 observers for
the elections; 1.75 million people are registered to vote.

   Eight parties other than the ruling
Sandinista party and the United National Opposition are running in
Sunday's elections.
   They may not gather many votes, but the constitution guarantees
one seat in the National Assembly to each defeated party with a
presidential ticket.
   Here is a brief look at the eight:
   _Social Christian Party:
   Probably the third-place finisher. The Social Christians are
supported by Eden Pastora, better known as Commander Zero, a former
Sandinista guerrilla leader who switched sides and fought with the
Contra rebels.
   Yatama, the native Indian organization, recently gave its
support to UNO's presidential ticket but remained allied with the
Social Christians in other races.
   Candidates: Erick Ramirez, president; Rina de Taboada, vice
president.
   _Revolutionary Unity Movement:
   The movement's presidential candidate, Moises Hassan, is the son
of a Palestinian immigrant and is a graduate in nuclear physics
from North Carolina State University.
   Hassan has been mayor of Managua, construction minister and vice
minister of the interior under the Sandinistas. The ultraleft
Hassan now claims the Sandinistas betrayed the true revolution.
   _Social Conservatism Party:
   The party's leader and presidential candidate, Fernando Aguero,
was once the foremost opposition figure. He was discredited after
signing a power-sharing pact with dictator Anastasio Somoza
following a massacre during an anti-Somoza demonstration he
organized.
   _Central American Unionist Party:
   The party believes in regional unification because of a common
historical past shared by Nicaragua and other Central American
countries. Its presidential candidate is Blanca Rojas, a university
professor.
   _Democrat Conservative Party:
   The party president, Clemente Guido, is a vice president of the
National Assembly and the recognized leader of the Conservative
bloc, made up of several splinter parties. The party is running
Eduardo Molina as its presidential candidate.
   _Marxist-Leninist Popular Action Movement:
   A small party that still advocates classic Marxism-Leninism. Its
presidential candidate is Isidro Tellez.
   _Revolutionary Workers' Party:
   Another small, far-left party. Presidential candidate: Bonifacio
Miranda.
   _National Unity Liberal Party:
   A splinter group from the Independent Liberals of UNO's vice
presidential candidate Virgilio Godoy. Presidential candidate:
Rodolfo Robelo.

   A pro-choice resolution approved by the American
Bar Association's governing body is dividing the lawyers group and
testing its members' capacity for professional detachment.
   Despite opposition from the ABA's president, president-elect,
secretary and treasurer, its governing body last week approved a
resolution endorsing a woman's right to an abortion.
   ``Some of the very best people in the ABA are in agony over this
resolution, and I'm sorry for that,'' said Sandy D'Alemberte, a
supporter of the measure who probably will become ABA president
next year.
   Among the ``best people'' he referred to are:
   _ Treasurer Joseph Nolan, who resigned from the Chicago-based
ABA, saying he could not reconcile his Roman Catholic beliefs with
a resolution ``that advocates abortion on demand.''
   _ Secretary Tony Palermo, who said he will seek the resolution's
repeal at the ABA convention in August on the grounds that abortion
is a personal and political issue, not a legal one. If he fails, he
may quit.
   _ President-elect John Curtin, who says he will not sign his
name to ABA friend-of-the-court briefs in abortion cases.
   _ Texas Bar Association President Darrell Jordan, who hints that
his and other state groups might pull back from the ABA.
   _ Pennsylvania Bar Association President-elect John Carpenter,
who said Friday he had resigned from the national group's governing
body, the ABA House of Delegates.
   The resolution also was criticized by Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, who contended that it raises questions about the ABA's
ability to honestly render advisory opinions on the professional
competence of judicial nominees.
   The resolution says the ABA ``opposes legislation or other
government action that interferes with the confidential
relationship between a pregnant woman and her physician or with the
decision to terminate the pregnancy at any time before the fetus is
capable of independent life.''
   As a result of the resolution's passage, ABA groups will be able
to file briefs in abortion cases and work against proposed state
laws that would restrict abortion rights. But Richard Collins, an
ABA spokesman, said abortion has not yet been added to the
association's list of legislative priorities.
   So far, the resolution's greatest impact has been on the ABA
itself.
   ``Even lawyers don't like contentiousness among themselves,''
said Estelle Rogers, who helped engineer the resolution's passage.
   At least 40 members of the 365,000-member organization have
resigned, and this week Palermo predicted ``a massive withdrawal''
of lawyers if the resolution is not repealed.
   Many ABA members have written the national office to ask what
the resolution says and what it means. When they find out, Nolan
predicted, many will demand change or follow him out the door. ``It
looks like a snowball,'' he said.
   This week, law professors at the University of Notre Dame in
South Bend, Ind., voted to end the school's payment of their $1,900
ABA dues to protest the resolution.
   Law Dean David Link said the decision among professors at the
Roman Catholic university was primarily based on a professional,
not a religious, objection.
   ``We're not saying they should have taken the opposite
position,'' Link said. ``They just shouldn't be in this when you
think of the division that still exists among members of the bar
association and in the courts.''

<HEAD>Report: Increased Security for Immigrating Soviet Jews</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel has increased security for Jewish
immigrants en route from the Soviet Union because of warnings that
Arab guerrillas may be planning attacks, newspapers reported Friday.
   President Chaim Herzog suggested that Israel censor reports
about immigration and the travel routes of those arriving.
   ``During all the years of great immigrations, governments of
Israel imposed censorship, in agreement with the media, on all
related to reports on immigration, numbers, countries of origin and
travel routes,'' he said on Israel radio.
   Imposing total censorship would be difficult, but previous
governments found ``the golden path between the need to explain the
issue to the Jewish people ... and the necessity to avoid providing
ammunition to our enemies,'' Herzog said.
   Friday's Jerusalem Post said a ``reliable source'' confirmed
that security was tightened after warnings were received that
unspecified guerrilla groups planned to attack immigrants from the
Soviet Union.
   Security officials would not confirm or deny the reports.
   Concern over the safety of immigrants grew after Arab protests
about the arrival of thousands of Soviet Jews in the past few
months.
   Palestinian groups fear Israel will encourage the new arrivals
to settle in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The
government has denied any such plan and only about 200 of last
year's 12,000 Soviet immigrants settled in the territories.
   Bassam Abu Sharif, political adviser to chairman Yasser Arafat
of the Palestine Liberation Organization, told reporters Wednesday
in Tunis:
   ``We consider the settlement of Soviet Jews in the West Bank is
an act of war against the Palestinian people and the Arab nation.
Such an act can only cause similar action on our part, that is to
say acts of war.''
   Zeev Schiff, a respected Israeli military commentator, wrote in
the daily Haaretz that such Palestinian statements ``create the
background for acts of terror against immigrants en route to Israel
or in Israel itself.''
   ``Such attacks may be expected in order to terrify, to make
immigration harder and to ignite the international community for
using pressure against Israel,'' he said.
   Schiff said Palestinian guerrillas may interpret Western
condemnations of the settling of immigrants in the occupied lands
as ``justifying violent acts against the immigrants and the
Israelis accompanying them.''
   ``Israel's security mechanisms will now have to invest thought
and resources in protecting the movement of immigrants to Israel,
coming from various directions,'' he wrote.
   One Palestinian attack on Jews leaving the Soviet Union has been
reported. In September 1973, two guerrillas of the Saiqa group
based in Syria attacked a train carrying 37 Soviet Jews near the
Austrian border, taking three emigrants and an Austrian hostage.
   Austria negotiated the hostages' release, but closed the
Schoenau center near Vienna, then the main transit point for Soviet
Jewish emigrants.
   Soviet Jews were immigrating to Israel at a rate of more than
2,500 a month at the time. Arab states protested that Moscow was
providing the Jewish state with manpower.
   Most Soviet Jews now go to Hungary or Romania and are flown to
Israel.
   The number of Soviet Jews arriving in Israel has increased
rapidly because of eased Soviet emigration policies. In 1988, about
2,000 Soviet Jews came to Israel, but the number grew to 12,000 in
1989 and more than 8,000 have arrived so far this year.

<HEAD>Former Defense Executive Pleads Guilty in Pentagon Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former executive of a United Technologies
Corp. division pleaded guilty Friday to conspiring to illegally
obtain inside information about a Pentagon competition for a
lucrative Navy contract.
   Roger K. Engel, 49, a former vice president of the company's
Norden Systems division in Norwalk, Conn., pleaded guilty to
conspiracy to defraud the government.
   Engel, who agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department's
investigation of Pentagon procurement fraud called ``Operation Ill
Wind,'' could receive a five-year sentence and fined up to $250,000.
   U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton in Alexandria, Va.,
scheduled Engel's sentencing for May 11.
   Engel is the third former Norden Systems executive to plead
guilty to participating in the conspiracy to obtain inside bid
information abou a $150 million contract to build a battlefield air
traffic-control system for the Marine Corps.
   A former senior vice president of Norden, James E. Rapinec, 54,
and C.J. (Jack) Richardson, a former marketing executive, pleaded
guilty in December and are also cooperating with prosecutors.
   The three men have all admitted they arranged in 1988 for Norden
to pay defense consultant Thomas E. Muldoon $49,500 to get
information about the Navy's contract competition from his contacts
in the Defense Department.
   Muldoon was paid $27,500 before the ``Ill Wind'' investigation
was publicly disclosed in June 1988, when FBI agents searched the
offices of a number of defense contractors, including Norden
Systems.
   Norden then withdrew from the Pentagon's competition for the
radar command and ground-control system, known as ATACC.
   Muldoon, who was sentenced last week to 27 months in prison for
participating in an unrelated scheme to bribe a Pentagon
procurement official, obtained the information with the help of
another defense consultant, Mark Saunders.
   Saunders obtained information about Norden's ranking in the
competition from George Stone, then a senior Navy procurement
official.
   Neither Saunders nor Stone has been charged.
   According to court papers, Muldoon told Richardson that his
``contact'' in the government was responsible for Norden being kept
in the competition.
   Norden's president, Edwin Decker, approved the consulting
arrangement with Muldoon, according to court papers.
   But Norden spokesman Scott Brinckerhoff said it was standard
practice for Decker, who has since retired, to approve consulting
contracts.
   ``He certainly did not approve illegally obtaining any kind of
information,'' Brinckerhoff said.

<TEXT>
   After a weeklong standoff with the
state, a sheriff with an overcrowded jail won permission to keep a
makeshift prison at a National Guard armory for at least two more
weeks.
   A Superior Court judge endorsed a temporary settlement between
the state, which owns the armory, and Hampden County Sheriff
Michael Ashe, who seized part of the building Feb. 16.
   Ashe, whose action sparked a war of words with the state and
drew support from many citizens, said he had just decided to ``go
out and do what I have to do.''
   The sheriff was under a federal court order forbidding him from
holding more than 500 prisoners in the 102-year-old Hampden County
Jail, which is designed to house 279.
   On Friday, 19 inmates were held at the temporary lockup at the
armory, in a large room with a concrete floor and a volleyball net
stretched between the walls.
   ``This is a victory for the people,'' Ashe said after the
hearing in which lawyers for county and state agreed to let him
keep using the armory until March 12. On that day, both sides are
supposed to report back with a permanent solution, or a hearing
will be held on the sheriff's request for an injunction allowing
him to keep using the armory.
   Under the settlement approved by Judge George Keady, Ashe agreed
to allow the National Guard to keep operating out of the building.
   ``I think what we wanted to do is keep it on the front burner
but turn down the heat,'' said Lawrence Fletcher-Hill, assistant
state attorney general.
   The sheriff shocked state officials when he moved on the armory,
telling guardsmen that he was seizing the property under a 17th
century statute ordering him to keep the peace. The sheriff said
his only other choice was to turn prisoners out onto the streets.
   State officials at first reacted angrily. Secretary of Public
Safety Charles V. Barry, who has jurisdiction over the armories,
issued a statement saying he would press criminal trespass charges
against the sheriff.
   The state had argued that the sheriff, as a county official,
doesn't have any right to take state property.
   But early in the week, the sheriff won a temporary restraining
order allowing him to stay at the armory. That, along with
widespread support from residents, local officials and even
prisoners, turned the focus to working out a compromise spot for
the prisoners.
   ``We're putting the issue of the sheriff's actions to the
side,'' Fletcher-Hill said at a news conference after Friday's
hearing. ``It's more important that we find a solution.''
   Officials declined to specify what locations they are
considering for overflow prisoners. A new jail is scheduled to be
built in nearby Ludlow, but that is at least two years away.
   Money for the temporary solution will come from funds set aside
for overcrowding problems, state prison officials said.

<HEAD>Britain Lifts Some South African Sanctions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain lifted restrictions Friday on investing
and promoting tourism in South Africa, acting alone after the rest
of the European Community refused to ease any sanctions.
   ``It is now entirely for the private sector to decide'' on new
investment, ``but we do feel very strongly that President de Klerk
has done more, and more quickly and with greater courage, than any
other South African president,'' Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
said.
   She has argued that international sanctions should be lifted to
reward de Klerk and his white government for political reforms and
the release of black leader Nelson Mandela on Feb. 11.
   Britain's action, announced in statements to the House of
Commons by Trade Secretary Nicholas Ridley and Employment Secretary
Michael Howard, means the government will ``no longer discourage''
investment or tour promotion, officials said.
   The organization that represents major British companies
operating in South Africa said it believed ending the non-binding
investment restrictions would make no immediate difference.
   ``Overseas capital is going to be very sensitive to political
developments there,'' said Tim Bird, spokesman for the British
Industry Committee on South Africa. ``For long-term investment, you
need long-term confidence.''
   The committee represets about 30 British companies with big
South African interests, including ICI, Shell and British Petroleum.
   It is unclear whether lifting the tourism restrictions will make
a marked difference. Brochures for South African vacations are not
prominently displayed in most travel agencies.
   Opposition Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock, opening the
headquarters of the Wales Anti-Apartheid movement in Cardiff, said
the government move was ``pathetically premature.''
   The general secretary of the South African Council of Churches,
the Rev. Frank Chikane, who arrived Friday on a visit, also said
Mrs. Thatcher had moved too fast.
   ``When we have reached the stage where the dismantling of
apartheid is irreversible, we will blow the whistle,'' he said.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate residential districts, schools and health services.
   Asked about her isolation on South Africa, Mrs. Thatcher said:
``It is a pretty cozy isolation, pretty crowded, judging by the
numbers of foreign statesmen who are talking to us.''
   She was speaking at a news conference with Italian Prime
Minister Giulio Andreotti, who paid a one-day visit to discuss
German unification.
   Andreotti said de Klerk ``has taken some extraordinary steps ...
and should be supported,'' but Italy, like the rest of the
12-nation European Community, refused a British appeal to lift the
non-binding investment and tourism restrictions.
   They were among measures imposed in 1986 by the European
Community, including binding bans on import of iron, steel and gold
coins that remain in effect.
   British investment has dropped from nearly $4.6 billion in 1984
to $3 billion in 1987, the latest government figure available, but
Britain remains the single largest foreign investor in South Africa.
   South Africa's biggest trading partners are West Germany, Italy,
France, Britain, United States and Japan.
   Mainly because of pressure from anti-apartheid groups, several
big British corporations, like hundreds of U.S. companies, have
withdrawn from South Africa in recent years and sold out to local
companies.
   It is also unclear if lifting the tourism restrictions will make
a marked difference. Brochures for South African vacations are not
prominently displayed in most travel agencies, but they are
available and South African Airways advertises in British
newspapers.

<HEAD>Hezbollah Leader Says Hostages Should be Freed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The spiritual leader of Hezbollah,
believed to be an umbrella organization for groups holding
hostages, said Friday the 18 Western captives in Lebanon should be
freed.
   ``We have to think of finding realistic and humanitarian means
to free the foreign hostages,'' Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah
said in a sermon at Friday prayers in Bir el-Abed, a district in
the Shiite Moslem slums of south Beirut.
   ``This problem has been widely exploited by Western forces to
distort the image of Islam and Moslems,'' he said.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is allied with Iran. The
English-language Tehran Times, which is close to President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, said Thursday the hostages should be freed because they
had become a propaganda tool of Iran's enemies.
   The editorial was the first known statement by an Iranian
newspaper in support of freeing the hostages.
   Shiite kidnappers are believed to hold most of the hostages, who
include eight Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss,
an Italian and an Irishman.
   Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, 42, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   In his first comment on the hostages of 1990, Fadlallah said:
``There should be a new study of this problem in order to to be
able to bring about a political and humanitarian solution that
guarantees the freedom of the captives and the rights of Moslems.
   ``We want to approach this issue, which is used by the
international media and as a means of pressure, on a new basis to
reach a solution that will close this case altogether and enable
the Islamic struggle to pick up new momentum.'' Fadlallah visits
Iran frequently and was in Tehran earlier this week for talks with
Iranian leaders.
   On Thursday in Damascus, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa told Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, that the Tehran Times
editorial was ``a good sign'' and he would be going to Iran soon to
persue the hostage issue.
   Al-Sharaa said he would ``work intensly with the top Iranian
leaders'' and ``I hope we will be able to arrive at good results.''
   He said Syria had told Iran's leaders ``it is their interest to
work with us in gaining the release of the hostages.''
   Syria has good relations with Iran. It was the only major Arab
country to support Iran in the eight-year war with Iraq that ended
in August 1988.
   Mrs. Say said of Fadlallah's statement: ``This is another
encouraging sign in a complicated situation. ... It seems most of
the parties are working toward a resoluton.''
   She is on a tour with an Associated Press delegation to seek the
release of Anderson and the others. She has met with U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, Pope John Paul II and
Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization.

   Twenty-one storm-battered counties in Alabama and Georgia were
declared federal disaster areas on Friday, and Mississippi and
Indiana residents piled sandbags in low-lying areas where they
expect floods this weekend.
   Forecasters said the Deep South's big soaking appeared to be
over for the time being, however, and drier cold air began to
replace the soggy warm air that has drenched the region for the
past two weeks.
   ``We're getting back to normal,'' said Mayor J.L. Nolen of Opp,
Ala., where a tornado on Thursday snapped trees, ripped the roofs
off buildings and sent 10 people to the hospital. ``We're just
extremely lucky no one got killed.''
   Damage from the recent storms was estimated at more than $30
million in Mississippi and Georgia alone. Alabama was hardest hit
by the most recent storm, but emergency officials there have not
set a figure on the loss.
   The American Red Cross said some 2,800 Alabama families have
been victimized by floods, tornadoes and other severe weather since
Feb. 10.
   Rowland Faust, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, said a dozen of Alabama's 67 counties had been added to an
earlier disaster declaration signed by President Bush, who
originally authorized aid to six counties.
   Bush declared nine northwestern Georgia counties to be disaster
areas on Friday because of the tornadoes and floods, and
Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus asked for federal disaster assistance
for 32 counties.
   The disaster declarations make federal relief money available to
individuals, businesses and local governments.
   In Simpson County, Miss., officials estimated that as many as
100 bridges were lost to flooding, and other counties have said
numerous bridges must either be repaired or replaced.
   In Jackson County, high waters from the upper Pascagoula Basin
were encroaching and civil defense officials said they offered
sandbags to residents whose homes were in the floodway.
   ``It's at my back door even as we speak,'' Harold Morris, a
computer programmer in Escatawpa. ``In a few hours it will start
coming into the bottom part of my house.''
   While high water problems continued to plague Mississippi's Gulf
Coast, an end to the recent heavy rains was allowing other
flood-damaged areas of the South to clean up.
   Further north, however, lowland portions of Indiana were
flooding, prompting road closings, evacuations and sandbagging.
   A psychiatric hospital in West Lafayette was surrounded by flood
waters and emergency workers in Fort Wayne were called to rescue a
pair of youths stranded when their canoe capsized, officials said.
   In Fort Wayne, the area hardest hit by rainfall Wednesday and
Thursday, about 30,000 sandbags were distributed and residents
helped seal off neighborhoods.
   ``When the water comes up, this is what you do,'' said Elizabeth
Batcha, who spent Friday morning throwing bags from a truck to her
Fort Wayne neighbors. ``Last June, we had water up to our front
steps.''
   The recent spate of soggy weather has been accompanied by record
high temperatures, and although more records fell on Friday,
forecasters said the balmy period was coming to an end.
   Bitter cold Arctic weather was poised to make a descent into the
eastern half of the nation. Forecasters warned of low temperatures
Sunday that would dip into the 30s in Florida's panhandle, in the
20s in northern Georgia and below zero in states along the Canadian
border.

   Seven-year-old Hilary Foretich, the subject of
one of the longest parental visitation disputes in the nation's
history, has been located in New Zealand, television station WRC
said Friday.
   The girl was found at a motel with her grandparents, the station
said.
   District of Columbia police spokesman Quintin Peterson said that
police were attempting to confirm that Hilary was in New Zealand.
   But, the detective investigating the case in New Zealand city of
Christchurch, Sgt. Russell Hawks, said she had been living in the
city ``for some time.''
   ``She's fine, in a healthy state, no problems there at all,''
Hawks said in a telephone interview with the station.
   Another police official, a Sgt. Peyton, told The Associated
Press that the case was already before a family court judge and
that the girl was in the custody of the grandparents. He declined
to be specific about the case, and would not confirm that the girl
in question was Hilary.
   The girl's mother, Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, spent 25 months in jail
for civil contempt of court rather than disclose the girl's
whereabouts.
   She maintained that Hilary's father, Dr. Eric Foretich, had
sexually abused the girl. On those grounds, she refused to give him
court-ordered visitation rights.
   Foretich has strongly denied ever abusing the child.
   Morgan, Foretich and both of their attorneys were not
immediately available for comment. There was no answer at the homes
of Morgan and Foretich and their attorneys did not immediately
return telephone calls.
   A reporter for Radio New Zealand, Jill Gallop, told the
television station that police confirmed Hilary and the
grandparents, Morgan's parents, had been in Christchurch for three
years.
   The grandparents last year sought permission to live in New
Zealand permanently, she said.
   The girl's identity was revealed when New Zealand authorities
checked with U.S. officials to determine if there were any
outstanding court orders pertaining to the child, Gallop reported.
   Morgan was released from jail in Washington in September after
President Bush signed a law limiting civil contempt in District of
Columbia child abuse cases to 12 months.

<HEAD>Romania Issues Bayonets To Control Demonstrations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has issued bayonets and
dogs to security forces and is moving additional police to
Bucharest to control demonstrations, Interior Minister Mihai Chitac
said Friday.
   The announcement came at a session of the ruling Provisional
Council of National Unity, which was discussing a decree that would
limit demonstrations.
   Also Friday, more than 500 people knelt and prayed at an
open-air Romanian Orthodox Mass in downtown Bucharest, the first
such celebration in decades.
   The new security measures followed actions last Sunday by
hundreds of anti-government demonstrators, who assaulted and
briefly occupied government headquarters at Victory Square.
   The interim government had been reluctant to use force against
demonstrators following the bloody uprising by protesters and army
troops that ended the 24-year reign of Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu.
   Chitac told the council Bucharest lacked officers and additional
police would be brought to the capital from other areas.
   He said about 4,500 new positions for police would be
established in the ministry.
   Soldiers stood aside last Sunday when demonstrators shattered
windows at government headquarters and occupied the building for
three hours. The troops said they had no orders to fire.
   At the Provisional Council's meeting Friday, seveal opposition
leaders accused the interim government of having secretly staged
the violent demonstration itself, so it could justify limiting
political demonstrations.
   State-run television on Friday showed thousands of people
demonstrating against the government the previous evening in
Timisoara, the western city where the uprising against Ceausescu
began last December.
   Demonstrators condemned communism and the leadership of interim
President Ion Iliescu.
   In downtown Bucharest on a sunny Friday, people crowded
University Square, some clutching candles, for the Mass celebrated
by a priest who was jailed and exiled for his opposition to the
Ceausescu regime.
   ``May God allow us to raise churches on our land in order to
have Jesus born again here,'' said the Rev. Gheorghe Calciu, who
returned this week from the United States.
   The crowd knelt silently to remember the revolution's victims,
then followed Calciu in a procession through the square to
flower-bedecked memorials.
   About a dozen police in long blue coats patrolled the square but
did not interfere.
   Calciu, 64, a human rights activist, was imprisoned by the
Communist regime for 21 years. Expelled from Romania in 1985, he
has been serving at Holy Cross Church in Alexandria, Va., and has
been spiritual leader of the Romanian World Congress exile
organization.
   Religious practice was discouraged under Ceausescu, and the
Romanian Orthodox Church, to which most of the population belongs,
was kept on a tight rein. Masses took place only in religious
buildings and believers were often persecuted.
   In Oradea in northwest Romania, unidentified assailants smashed
windows and broke down the doors of a synagogue on the night of
Feb. 15-16, said Teodor Blumenfeld, general secretary of the
Federation of Romanian Jewish Communities.
   They tore apart the building, apparently looking for gold and
silver objects, he said. They did not find any, but destroyed
prayer books, shawls and kits, Blumenfeld said. He estimated damage
at nearly $1,500.
   No one was arrested, he said.
   Romania's chief rabbi, Moses Rosen, said last week he feared a
surge of anti-Semitism in the more open climate following the
December revolution.
   He said groups like the Iron Guard, Romania's former fascist
movement allied with the Nazis, could be reborn.
   Blumenfeld said security guards and alarm systems were being
provided for synagogues around the country. But he called the
Oradea attack an isolated incident.
   An announcement appeared Wednesday in the Bacau newspaper
Desteptarea announcing establishment of an extremist right-wing
organization, the Anti-Communist Army-Archangel Michael Legion,
national newspapers said Friday.
   It declared that the group would ``not give up until all
Communists, socialists and other left- wing elements are
liquidated.''
   The notice said if the newspaper did not print the warning, ``we
will strike against you.'' It was signed ``Heil Hitler.''
   Police said soldiers and police were guarding the newspaper
offices.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   Rain moved across many of the Atlantic states Friday, and 21
storm-torn counties in Alabama and Georgia were declared federal
disaster areas after two weeks of drenching.
   Before skies clouded over and temperatures dropped, record highs
were recorded from Georgia and South Carolina to Portland, Maine.
   Rain and thunderstorms extended from Florida across eastern New
York state and much of New England. Parts of Kansas, Arkansas and
Missouri also received rain, while the upper Great Lakes states got
snow.
   Snow fell in portions of Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois and Iowa.
   Drier, cold air began to replace soggy warm air in the Deep
South, where a dozen Alabama counties were added to an earlier
emergency relief declaration because of recent storms. Nine Georgia
counties were declared disaster areas because of tornadoes and
floods.
   High water continued to threaten Mississippi's Gulf Coast, and
residents in lowland Indiana helped seal off neighborhoods from
flood waters with sandbags.
   Mooreville, N.C., and Savannah, Ga., received some damage from
thunderstorm gusts. Charlotte, N.C., had gusts up to 70 mph, the
National Weather Service said.
   Boston's high of 63 degrees broke the date's previous record of
59 degrees, set in 1976, and Providence, R.I., broke a 57-year-old
record by one degree with a reading of 61. Portland, Maine,
recorded a high of 58, breaking the record of 52 last set in 1981.
A high of 80 degrees in Columbia, S.C., shattered a record 79 that
had stood since 1897. Helena, Mont., had a high of 55, which broke
the old mark of 54 set in 1881.
   The high temperature in the Lower 48 states was 88 degrees in
Sarasota and Bradenton in Florida.

   The Senate Ethics Committee questioned a
former top thrift regulator Friday in an investigation of five
senators who intervened with banking officials on behalf of Lincoln
Savings and Loan.
   Edwin J. Gray, former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, said he met with the committee for four hours behind closed
doors and ``they might choose to invite me back.''
   The ex-regulator declined to discuss his testimony because,
``The committee asked me to hold confidential'' any discussions of
Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., John
McCain, R-Ariz., Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich. and John Glenn,
D-Ohio.
   All five have denied wrongdoing. The committee's investigation
is still in its preliminary stage.
   Sources familiar with the overall investigation said the
committee appears to be exploring all possible relationships
between the senators and Phoenix millionaire Charles H. Keating
Jr., the former head of Lincoln, based in Irvine, Calif.
   These sources, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said the
committee is ranging beyond a 1987 meeting between four senators
and Gray _ and a session a week later between all five senators and
San Francisco-based regulators. The senators asked for the meetings
at the request of Keating, who complained that he was treated
unfairly.
   Keating, his family members and associates contributed some $1.3
million to the campaigns and causes of the five senators. The
government ousted Keating and took control of the failing Lincoln
on April 14, 1989, and the cost of protecting depositors at the
thrift may exceed $2 billion, believed to be the biggest of the
many losses in the nation's S&amp;L debacle.
   Gray testified last November that four of the senators asked
him, in a private meeting on April 2, 1987, to drop a proposed
regulation that would have curtailed risky investments by Lincoln.
In return, he told the House Banking Committee, the four would get
``their friend'' Keating to make more home loans.
   Gray identified the four as DeConcini, Glenn, Cranston and
McCain, and described the offer as ``a quid pro quo.''
   Those senators and Riegle met a week later to discuss the case
with the San Francisco examiners, who were investigating Lincoln
and recommending its seizure by the government.
   One source said, ``It appears the committee is going to go
beyond the meetings into a full recounting of the relationship
between Keating and the senators.''

   Humorist Andy Rooney, who usually has a lot to
say, was unavailable Friday to discuss reports he may return early
from a three-month suspension from the CBS ``60 Minutes'' show.
   Rooney, who was suspended by CBS News President David Burke
after a newspaper attributed a racist remark to him, could return
to the show as early as next week, The Wall Street Journal and New
York Newsday reported. The Washington Post said he could return as
early as March 4 from the 90-day suspension imposed Feb. 8.
   Burke's spokesman, Tom Goodman, said CBS wouldn't comment on
whether Rooney, who met earlier this week with Burke, would return
early.
   Rooney didn't return phone calls.
   A source familiar with the situation, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Burke was reviewing the matter, but had yet to
reach a decision.
   Rooney was suspended without pay after a gay magazine, The
Advocate, attributed to him a racial slur. Rooney denied making the
remark.
   Advocate writer Chris Bull, who interviewed Rooney, has said he
stands by his story.
   Burke never has made public any specific reason for suspending
Rooney.
   Rooney earlier drew fire from homosexual activists for a Dec. 28
CBS special in which he said ``many of the ills which kill us are
self-induced,'' and then listed ``homosexual unions'' as among
those ills.
   As of last Friday, CBS had received 5,133 calls about Rooney's
suspension, with 5,061 supporting him, said CBS News spokesman Roy
Brunett.

<HEAD>Balladeer Johnnie Ray in Coma With Liver Failure, Condition Grave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifties balladeer Johnnie Ray, known as the
``Prince of Wails'' for his vocal histrionics on such songs as
``Somebody Stole My Gal'' and ``Just Walkin' in the Rain,'' was in
a coma Friday with liver failure.
   Ray, 63, was not expected to live, according to a statement
issued late Thursday by Alan Eichler Associates, a public relations
firm.
   Ray, whose condition deteriorated steadily since he entered
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Feb. 16, slipped into a coma Thursday
with total liver failure, said hospital spokesman Ron Wise. The
spokesman described his condition as grave.
   The once slender, boyish singer was credited with
revolutionizing popular music in the early 1950s with his unique
blend of rhythm and blues, country and gospel punctuated with
real-sounding sobs.
   Some said his raw and emotional style opened the door to a new
type of music that later became rock 'n' roll.
   Ray's first hit record was ``Cry,'' followed by ``The Little
White Cloud That Cried,'' ``Please Mr. Sun,'' ``Brokenhearted, ''
``What's the Use,'' ``Somebody Stole My Gal,'' ``Who's Sorry Now,''
and ``Yes Tonight Josephine.''
   His unusual singing style quickly became the butt of jokes and a
prime target of impersonators. At various times he was dubbed ``The
Prince of Wails,'' ``The Howling Success,'' ``The Nabob of Sob,''
`The Song Wringer,'' ``The Cry Guy'' and the ``Master of Misery.''
   ``Of course the days are gone of the screaming teen-agers _ and
nobody had them screaming more than I did,'' Ray recalled in a 1984
interview with the Associated Press.
   ``But even in those days I had the same kind of audience I have
now _ the elderly, the middle-aged and the young kids,'' he said.
``I don't have a TV series, I've had no hit records.
   Ray was born Jan. 10, 1927, in Dallas, Ore., a tiny town near
Salem.
   It was there he saw his first movie when he was 3 or 4. ``It was
Edna Mae Oliver in `Murder on the Blackboard,' and from then on I
wanted to be a movie star,'' he told the AP.
   In 1954, Darryl F. Zanuck offered him a seven-year contract with
20th Century Fox and he co-starred with Ethel Merman, Dan Dailey,
Marilyn Monroe, Donald O'Connor and Mitzi Gaynor in ``There's No
Business Like Show Business.''
   Ray's movie career ended when Zanuck resigned to become an
independent producer.
   ``The new head of Fox was Buddy Adler, and a Johnnie Ray fan he
was not,'' Ray said.

<HEAD>Mandela Meets Opposition Leaders of Parliament</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela met Friday with
liberal white and mixed-race members of Parliament who have been
shunned by some black militants because they take part in a
legislative body that excludes blacks.
   Aides to Mandela, meanwhile, said the African National Congress
leader will leave next week on an 18-day, four-nation trip, his
first abroad since his release Feb. 11 after 27 years in prison.
   He plans to fly Tuesday to Lusaka, Zambia, to meet leaders of
African countries and confer with the exiled leadership of the ANC.
   He then will spend three days in Zimbabwe and six days in
Tanzania, aides said. On March 12 he will fly to Sweden to visit
ANC President Oliver Tambo, who is recovering from a stroke in a
Stockholm clinic.
   Mandela said Friday in an interview with British Broadcasting
Corp. television that the ANC was willing to compromise with the
government and that democratic elections must precede negotiations
on the future of the country.
   He was interviewed at his home in Soweto and the program was
broadcast in Britain.
   Mandela said nationalization of industry was a basic ANC policy,
but he added: ``If we decide to negotiate, then we must be open to
compromise. If you are not prepared to compromise, then you don't
negotiate. Once we commit ourselves to negotiation, then we admit
the possibility of compromise.''
   He said the only way of determining who will be involved in the
talks on South Africa's future is through democratic elections.
   He also said the ANC did not claim to be the only voice of black
South Africans. ``But we are confident that we can lead the
struggle for change in the country,'' he said.
   Mandela met at his home Friday with the three co-leaders of the
Democratic Party, which represents anti-apartheid whites in
Parliament.
   The party has tried to build alliances with black groups in
recent years with some success. But some militants have refused to
deal with the Democrats because they remain in Parliament, which
has houses for whites, Asians and people of mixed-race, but
excludes blacks.
   Democratic co-leader Denis Worrall said his delegation agreed
with Mandela on the need for universal voting rights, but differed
over the ANC's support for guerrilla violence, economic sanctions
and nationalization.
   Mandela has reaffirmed his support for ANC economic policies,
which call for the nationalization of mines, banks and monopoly
industries.
   He and other ANC officials have sought to reassure white
business people, however, saying economic issues should be subject
to negotiation and compromise.
   Mandela also met the Rev. Allan Hendrickse, leader of
Parliament's mixed-race chamber.
   The ANC has urged boycotts of elections for the mixed-race and
Asian chambers of Parliament. But Hendrickse said after meeting
Mandela that the ANC and the Labor Party, which controls the
mixed-race chamber, would be able to work together.
   Mandela's aides said the black leader plans to meet Monday with
Gavin Relly, chairman of the Anglo American Corp., the world's No.
1 gold producer.
   Relly has spoken out frequently against apartheid, and his
corporation espouses relatively liberal employment policies.
   Also Friday, an ANC delegation led by one of the group's
leaders, Walter Sisulu, met with church leaders in Natal Province
to discuss ways of resolving a 4-year-old black factional struggle
that has claimed about 3,000 lives. Mandela is to join the
delegation Sunday for a huge rally in the port city of Durban.
   In Johannesburg, hundreds of blacks joined more than 1,000
whites in a march organized by the Democratic Party in support of
peace and democracy.

<TEXT>
   Incriminating videotaped and written statements
from five teens accused in the gang rape and near-fatal beating of
a jogger in Central Park are admissible as evidence at their trial,
a judge ruled Friday.
   Six teens are accused of being part of a band of roving youths
who attacked an investment banker as she jogged through the park
the night of April 19.
   Admission of the statements was critical to the prosecution's
case because the victim has no memory of the attack and cannot
testify against her alleged assailants, and because there is no
physical evidence that conclusively links the suspects to the
attack.
   The woman, now 29, was raped, beaten and left for dead, but has
since made a recovery doctors call remarkable and returned to work.
   Of six teen-agers charged with attacking the woman, five gave
statements to the police that were videotaped.
   One of them, Antron McCray, 16, said, ``We took turns getting on
top of her.'' He said he punched and kicked the jogger and another
defendant, Yusef Salaam, 15, hit her with a pipe. McCray, according
to a third defendant, Kevin Richardson, 15, ``had sex with her.''
   The six are charged with with rape, sodomy, assault and
attempted murder. Four other youths are charged in attacks on male
joggers that night.
   Attorney Jesse Berman, who is defending one of the youths,
complained after the ruling that Judge Thomas Galligan suppressed
``next to nothing.''
   The only exception to the ruling was a comment made by one of
the teens to a police officer at a precinct stationhouse.
   After the officer told the teen-agers, ``You should be out with
your girlfriends instead of being out beating people,'' the youth
replied, ``I got mine,'' the policeman has testified. Galligan gave
no reason for the exception.
   Another defense attorney, referring to the judge's ruling to
suppress suspects' statements in another murder case in which the
victim was black and his alleged attacker white, suggested that
racism tainted Galligan's decision.
   ``There is a double standard,'' said attorney Colin Moore. ``We
came in expecting nothing, and that's what we came away with.''
   The teen-agers charged in the case are black.

<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS grafs 7: ``The rotatational,'' to note 1982 loss made
up; ADDS one graf to note other causes of slowing.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If it seems like some days will never end, it
may not be your imagination. A government scientist confirms that
the day got longer recently.
   The Earth's rotation slowed slightly during a 10-day period in
January, causing the length of a day to increase by
five-ten-thousandths of a second, reports Dr. Dennis McCarthy of
the U.S. Naval Observatory.
   The change occurred starting Jan. 24 and has been associated
with a series of westerly bursts of wind blowing out of Asia across
the Pacific Ocean, McCarthy reported.
   Minute changes in the Earth's rotation are most often associated
with such weather, he explained, because of the force of the winds
acting on the planet's surface.
   The last time the planet slowed significantly was during the
1982-1983 El Nino event, when it decreased by two-ten-thousandths
of a second.
   While climatologists reports that there are signs of a new El
Nino developing in the Pacific, McCarthy said in a telephone
interview that it is too soon for that to affect the planet.
   The rotational speed lost in the 1982-1983 event was gradually
regained, but it remains to the seen if the January loss will be
made up, he said.
   An El Nino is a series of changes in ocean water temperature and
air pressure that has been known to alter weather conditions
worldwide. The 1982-83 occurrence was considered the most severe of
its type in at least a century.
   Changes in the Earth's speed of rotation are calculated by
precise observations of the apparent movement of stars and planets
in the sky.
   The January and 1982-1983 slowdowns are not connected with the
much more gradual retardation of the earth's rotation caused by the
moon. To compensate, from time to time ``leap seconds'' are added
to the calendar, such as the 61st second that came at the end of
the last minute of 1989.

<TEXT>
   A brother of Carol Stuart said Friday his family
remains angry about her killing, but letters of support and
contributions to a scholarship fund set up in her name have
restored their faith in people.
   ``There are times when the whole situation angers me,'' Carl
DiMaiti said. ``That so many lives can be so disrupted and
shattered in such a short period of time for no real reason, or no
reason that I can see or reason that I can understand.''
   It was DiMaiti's first formal interview since his
brother-in-law, Charles Stuart, apparently committed suicide Jan. 4
after investigators learned he made up a story about he and his
wife being shot by a black gunman.
   DiMaiti spoke the day after the FBI began a preliminary inquiry
into the Boston Police Department's investigation of the case. The
inquiry is focused on allegations that police intimidated and
coerced several people into implicating William Bennett, who is
black, in Carol Stuart's slaying last Oct. 23.
   The Suffolk County grand jury met Friday for the fourth time
since Charles Stuart apparently jumped off a bridge into the Boston
Harbor. Three of his siblings, Neysa Porter, Shelley Yandoli and
Michael Stuart, reportedly appeared before the grand jury.
   Charles Stuart originally told investigators that he and his
pregnant wife were shot by a mugger while leaving a childbirth
class. Mrs. Stuart, 30, died of her wounds and the couple's son,
delivered prematurely by Caesarean section, died 17 days later.
   Stuart's story about the black gunman touched off a massive
manhunt during which minority residents allege their civil rights
were violated.
   DiMaiti, 37, a former high school teacher who now runs the
family pizza dough business, said his family has found new hope in
the Carol DiMaiti Stuart Foundation formed last month.
   The foundation was established to award scholarships to
residents of the Mission Hill neighborhood, where Charles Stuart
originally told police the bogus holdup occurred.
   Contributions to the fund totaling $253,000 have poured in from
around the country, the latest a check for $5,122.40 from New
England Baptist Hospital. Letters of support have poured in. Many
are addressed simply to ``DiMaiti Family, Medford, Mass.,'' DiMaiti
said. And many letters are from people who also experienced the
loss of a loved one, he said.
   ``They said the pain will ease,'' DiMaiti said. ``They say it's
something you never get over but it does get better.''
   DiMaiti described his mother as still ``devastated'' by her
daughter's death, but said the letters and contributions from as
far away as California and overseas have helped restore her faith
in people.
   DiMaiti would not comment on the FBI's inquiry into the manner
in which Boston police handled the case.
   The investigation, undertaken at the request of U.S. Attorney
Wayne Budd, will examine ``allegations that individuals were
coerced or intimidated into making statements implicating Willie
Bennett,'' said a statement issued Thursday by FBI Special Agent
Thomas Hughes.
   Bennett, who is black, was named by police as a suspect after
Carol Stuart's shooting, but he was cleared after Charles Stuart's
apparent suicide.

<HEAD>Tugs Struggle to Cool Down Crippled Tanker</HEAD>

   A flotilla of salvage tugs worked Friday
to prevent a flareup of fires that could touch off another blast
aboard a U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker crippled by an explosion.
   U.S. Navy warships warned other vessels to keep at least four
miles away from the fire-ravaged Surf City. The U.S.-flagged tanker
was en route to Italy loaded with naphtha and diesel fuel when a
blast ripped through it Thursday in the Persian Gulf, 20 miles off
the United Arab Emirates coast.
   U.S. military officials identified the two people killed in the
explosion as the ship's master, Derrick F. Linardich, 38, of
Norfolk, Va.; and the first mate, Steven P. McHugh, 34, of East
Bridgewater, Mass.
   The other 23 crew members scrambled to lifeboats as flames raced
across half of the 700-foot ship. The crewmen, including four with
minor injuries, were rescued by the American missile frigate USS
Simpson.
   Spokesmen at U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Fla., the
headquarters responsible for U.S. operations in the Gulf, said they
were told that the Surf City's chief engineer was
``British-Canadian,'' but others said all 25 crewmen were American.
   One survivor, 27-year-old Wayne Cohen of Boston, said the
captain and first mate were in an area where work was being done on
a cargo tank when ``the whole ship blew up.''
   The 81,283-ton tanker is one of five Kuwaiti tankers still
sailing under protection of the U.S. flag 19 months after the end
of the Iran-Iraq war.
   C. Miles Sheldon, head of Chesapeake Shipping Inc., told a Dubai
news conference that the bodies of the captain and first mate were
recovered and would be sent home from Dubai. Chesapeake Shipping is
the subsidiary set up by the Kuwait Oil Tanker Co. to operate the
U.S.-flagged ships.
   Sheldon said that although the fires had been contained and the
tanker was no longer in immediate danger of sinking, its condition
remained unpredictable.
   He said the ship and cargo together were worth more than $30
million.
   In Kuwait, the chairman of Kuwait Oil Tanker Co., Abdul-Fattah
al-Bader, said the blast most likely had been caused by a short
circuit. He agreed with U.S. military officials who had discounted
the possibility of Iranian sabotage or a drifting mine.
   The Surf City was described by witnesses as sharply down by its
bow and listing, as a result of water pouring through a huge hole
in its side. Smoke still billowed from the ship Friday, leaving a
streak in the sky visible from shore.
   Gulf-based shipping sources said about eight tugboats were on
the scene, some dousing the tanker with water and fire-smothering
foam to reduce chances of another explosion in its volatile cargo.
   ``The accommodation quarters are still smoldering, and the heat
could blow up the cargo, which would be a major disaster,'' said
one source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Al-Bader said there would be no pollution problem even if the
tanker should sink, because the oil would evaporate.
   Eleven Kuwait-owned tankers reflagged by the United States in
mid-1987 to afford them naval escorts as protection from attacks by
Iran, which was targeting the shipping of countries supporting Iraq.
   Six of the tankers reverted to Kuwaiti registry a year ago,
while the other five have continued to sail under the U.S. flag.
They are manned by American crews.

   Authorities in Sudan detained a British journalist
after he interviewed the military government's chief of security,
an editor of the Financial Times said Friday.
   Julian Ozanne, 25, has been held at security headquarters in
Khartoum since Wednesday, said Jurek Martin, the newspaper's
foreign editor.
   Ozanne is the Financial Times' East Africa stringer based in
Nairobi, Kenya. He arrived in Khartoum on Sunday on assignment for
the Sunday Correspondent, another London newspaper.
   Ozanne was questioned by a military official Tuesday and ordered
to report the following morning to security headquarters. His hotel
room was searched and notes and papers were taken, said Martin.
   The British ambassador to Sudan visited Ozanne on Thursday and
Friday and reported him in good health, Martin said. But there was
no word on his release.
   The London-based International Press Institute protested the
detention and appealed to Sudan's leader, Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan
el-Bashir, to release the reporter.
   The institute said Ozanne was detained after interviewing Col.
Bakri Hassan Saleh, Sudan's head of security.
   Martin said he did not know why Ozanne was being held, but he
said there were several sensitive issues he was likely to be
writing about, including the Sudanese civil war and the outcome of
the trial of terrorists who bombed a hotel in Khartoum, killing two
British aid workers.

<TEXT>
   An Army deserter who spent 30 years
in East Germany said Friday he was only there a few weeks before he
realized he must try to escape that country's grim conditions and
danger.
   ``I feel like I threw 30 years of my life away,'' Arnold
Kephart, 53, said in an interview here at the home of his
brother-in-law, Arlo Dunbar.
   Speaking with a heavy German accent, Kephart said the country
he's returned to is ``a different world'' and he never thought he
would see anything like the rapid liberalization of Eastern Europe.
   ``It was like you were locked up all the time. I never really
ever felt at home,'' he said.
   As an Army private in 1959, Kephart wrecked an Army truck and,
fearing punishment, fled to East Germany.
   While there, Kephart said, he had 14 or 15 jobs, married twice
and had four children, including a son he brought back with him.
   When he returned to the United States last month, Kephart was
arrested at the airport before upset relatives who had been waiting
for the reunion. A week later, the Army granted him an
other-than-honorable discharge.
   A deal for a television movie of Kephart's life has just been
closed, according to his attorney, James Martin Davis. He wouldn't
reveal details.
   Kephart, who earned his living as a truck driver in East
Germany, said he regretted his spur-of-the-moment decision to go
absent without leave a few weeks after settling in Schmalkalind,
the town where he lived for 30 years.
   Travel restrictions were so tight that only two opportunities to
escape come along before East Germany opened its borders last year.
   The first attempt came in 1973 or 1974, Kephart said. His first
marriage _ which produced a daughter, Kitty _ had ended in divorce.
   Kephart said he met two men ``in a beer joint'' who asked him if
he wanted to get out.
   ``Maybe we had too many beers, but this one said he knew where
there was a hole in the fence,'' Kephart recalled.
   He and his companions set out. He said he doesn't remember where
they were headed, except that it was out of town. One of the men
was walking near the border about five minutes ahead of Kephart and
the other man when Kephart heard a noise.
   ``We thought maybe he stepped on a mine,'' Kephart said. ``We
just turned around and headed back to town.
   ``Two or three days later, I heard that they'd found a person on
the border _ dead,'' Kephart said. ``There's no way that couldn't
have been the guy we were with.''
   Before the second attempt 1975, Kephart drank ``enough beer to
get my courage up and so I'd have an excuse if I got caught,'' he
said.
   Kephart said three guards grabbed him as he approached the
border, beat him, and sent him back to town.
   ``After that, I didn't think about trying the border again,'' he
said.
   He met his second wife, Brigitte, a year after he was beaten.
She is the mother of Frankie, now 12 and in the United States with
his father, and Kephart's 8-year-old twin daughters, Katharina and
Kathleen.
   The family lived in a small house, Kephart said. Their diet was
meager: bread with some bologna-like meat for breakfast, soup and
potatoes for lunch. Dinner was a reprise of breakfast, he said.
   ``You could seldom get eggs,'' said Kephart, who added that he
is enjoying foods he sorely missed in East Germany.
   ``I always loved chili,'' he said. ``And pork and beans. They
just don't have anything like that over there.''

   Federal regulators on Friday seized the
savings and loan industry's second largest holder of junk bonds, a
California institution that worked closely with indicted financier
Michael Milken.
   The Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision turned
Imperial Savings Association, San Diego, over to the Resolution
Trust Corp., a federal agency created in August to dispose of
insolvent S&amp;Ls.
   At the end of the year, Imperial had $9.7 billion in assets, the
thrift office said. High-yield, high-risk bonds represented more
than 10 percent of its portfolio. The institution was $60.1 million
in the red, regulators said.
   Also seized on Friday was Mercury Savings and Loan Association,
Huntington Beach, Calif. It had $2.16 billion in assets and was $33
million in the red, the thrift office said.
   Mercury operated more traditionally than Imperial, but had
invested in several large hotel projects that went sour.
   Like several other large institutions before it, Imperial ran
afoul of provisions in last summer's savings and loan bill
requiring it to value its securities at market value rather than
the purchase price.
   It was forced to recognize $200 million in junk bond losses in
the last quarter of last year and had indicated it expected to take
a writedown of at least $50 million more in the current quarter.
   At the end of September, Imperial was the 16th largest S&amp;L in
the nation and had the second biggest junk bond portfolio, behind
only Columbia Savings and Loan Association of Beverly Hills,
Calif., according to Sheshunoff Information Services.
   Of the top four junk bond holders in the S&amp;L business, only
Columbia, with $4.1 billion of the bonds, remains out of the
government's control. Analysts speculate, however, that it may be
one of the next takeovers. Its debt has been downgraded by Moody's
Investors Service and regulators have restricted its activities
since November.
   ``I think that Columbia has to be real close to the margin,''
said Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., financial institutions analyst.
``I wouldn't be surprised to see Columbia popped (into the RTC)
fairly soon.''
   CenTrust Bank of Miami, No. 3 in junk bonds, was seized earlier
this month, and City Federal Savings Bank of Bedminster, N.J., No.
4, toppled in December.
   The seizures make the government, through the RTC, the largest
owner of junk bonds.
   Imperial, the chief subsidiary of Imperial Corp. of America, had
80 branch offices in California, which will remain open during
normal business hours. It had $7.6 billion in deposits in 387,000
accounts, the RTC said. All accounts up to the $100,000 federal
insurance limit are guaranteed.
   Founded in 1950, Imperial grew as it helped finance the
post-World War II housing boom in California. However, under former
Chief Executive Kenneth J. Thygerson and investor Victor Goulet, it
took advantage of California's liberal regulations to venture into
risky investments. It became a major customer of Milken, who was
head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s junk bond operation in
Beverly Hills, Calif.
   Junk bonds have declined 15 percent to 20 percent on average
since the summer. Earlier this month, Drexel Burnham's parent
company sought protection under federal bankrupcty laws.
   Thygerson, who had joined the thrift in 1985, resigned last
July. His successors were trying to save the institution by
shrinking it to half of its peak size of $12 billion and returning
it to more traditional practices.
   But the thrift office said in a statement, ``There was no
possibility of replenishing capital without federal assistance.''
   In addition to junk bonds, Imperial had purchased a troubled
portfolio of car loans from Grand Wilshire Finance Corp., a
now-bankrupt Los Angeles-area firm. It was also suffering from
problem loans it made to a now-bankrupt New Jersey firm that sold
Yugo automobile dealerships in the United States.
   Spokesmen for Imperial did not immediately return telephone
calls seeking comment.
   All told, regulators seized 12 S&amp;Ls on Friday, including First
Atlantic Savings and Loan Association of Plainfield, N.J., with
$1.3 billion in assets.
   The RTC has more than 330 S&amp;Ls under its control with about $180
billion in assets.
   Though 12 S&amp;Ls were seized, by Friday night the names of only
seven had been released.
   The other four for which the Resolution Trust Corp. was
appointed receiver:
   _Provident Federal, Casper, Wyo., with $263 million in assets.
   _Frontier Federal Savings and Loan Association, Walla Walla,
Wash., $166 million.
   _Texasbank Savings FSB, Conroe, Texas, $381 million.
   _Nowlin Savings Association, North Richland Hills, Texas, $227
million.

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>

   The General Assembly approved a plan
Friday to combat worldwide drug abuse and the illicit narcotics
trade, but a U.N. official said more money is needed to win the
battle.
   The measures put together during the world body's four-day
special session on narcotics focused more on eliminating demand
through reduced consumption than previous U.N. anti-drug plans.
   The plan also emphasized promoting economic development and the
importance of increased foreign trade to aid countries under siege
by powerful drug producers and traffickers.
   It urges tighter controls of chemicals and equipment used to
manufacture illegal drugs, and recommends steps to prevent the
international banking system and other financial institutions from
being used for laundering profits from the illicit drug trade.
   The plan calls for increased efforts to develop alternative
incomes, such as crop substitution, for drug-producing countries.
It also urges increased law enforcement cooperation and stresses
the importance of treatment and rehabilitation for drug users.
   The plan says countries can receive help in eliminating demand
through several U.N. bodies, such as the U.N. Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization, the U.N. Children's Fund and
the World Health Organization.
   The coordinator of U.N. drug programs, Margaret Anstee, said,
``I'm afraid that if we're not ready to put all the resources in,
then I think we might lose the war against drugs.''
   She told a news conference that if the financially strapped
United Nations does not receive more resources to strengthen its
anti-drug campaign, there may be increased calls for legalization
of narcotics.
   ``I'm not in favor of legalization, but we might end up in a
situation where legalization would take place simply because we
have not even barely fought the first battle on this matter,'' she
said.
   U.N. officials have estimated that the United Nations needs an
additional $33-$35 million during the next two years for drug
programs already in place. The new programs recommended by the
plan, adopted by consensus, would require even more money, but the
level of funding necessary has not been determined, Mrs. Anstee
said.
   Some countries, including the United States, have said the
enhanced drug programs can be funded by diverting resources from
other areas within the United Nations.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar stressed in his
opening speech before the session that the anti-drug fight is an
exceptional situation requiring budget increases.

   Interior Minister Richard Sacher
will reinforce weekend police patrols to avert a possible
disruption of pro-democracy rallies, the official news agency CTK
reported Friday.
   It said the decision was made because of concern over disruptive
action by ``dark forces'' still active in Czechoslovakia, which was
ruled by a hard-line Communist regime until a peaceful revolution
in November. It did not elaborate.
   Police patrols will be augmented by Interior Ministry troops,
the agency said.
   Until this year, Feb. 25 was celebrated as the anniversary of
the Communist takeover in 1948.
   The Civic Forum, a loose opposition movement governing in
coalition with the Communists and other parties, is sponsoring a
rally in downtown Prague on Saturday in memory of Jan Zajic, who
burned himself to death Feb. 25, 1969, to protest the presence of
Soviet military forces.
   Soviet troops have been stationed in Czechoslovakia since a
Warsaw Pact invasion crushed the ``Prague Spring'' liberalization
of 1968.
   President Vaclav Havel travels to Moscow on Monday and is
expected to sign an agreement on the withdrawal of the 75,000 Red
Army troops in Czechoslovakia.

   More than 60 years ago, James Stewart
arrived at Princeton University with an accordian and an ambition
to become an engineer.
   The engineer dream, the famed actor recalled Friday, was dashed
after just a year at the Ivy League school.
   ``College algebra,'' Stewart, 81, recalled with a smile, ``was
like a death blow.''
   But Stewart, who on Saturday will receive the school's highest
alumni honor _ the Woodrow Wilson Award _ said his prowess on the
accordian helped him gain his first parts in the school's Triangle
Club theater productions.
   ``Then the parts got a little bigger,'' Stewart said at a news
conference. ``I guess you could say I started in the acting
business through my accordian.''
   Stewart later stalled plans to study architecture in graduate
school to join Princeton classmate Joshua Logan in a summer stock
company, and one of America's most fabled acting careers was
launched.
   He starred in such films as ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,''
``The Philadelphia Story,'' ``Harvey,'' ``Rear Window,'' and his
personal favorite, ``It's a Wonderful Life.''
   Stewart, an Academy Award winner for his acting, holder of
medals for his service during World War II, and recipient of the
nation's highest civilian award, the Medal of Freedom, said being
honored by his alma mater ``is one of the most important events of
my life.''
   ``I was a terrible student,'' said Stewart, who graduated in
1932. ``I started out with the idea that I wanted to become an
engineer because I was interested in aviation. After my first year,
every teacher, every man that I had anything to deal with, said the
same thing: `You're in the wrong racket. Engineering is not for
you.'''

   An Air Force captain targeted by a spy
investigation was honorably discharged Friday and the investigation
was closed, the Air Force announced.
   Capt. John Vladimir Hirsch, 34, never was charged, but was
brought back from a West Berlin post to Kelly Air Force Base in
July because of the probe.
   ``The investigation did not substantiate espionage, and the case
was closed,'' 1st Lt. Joe Wiggins, a spokesman for the Electronic
Security Command headquarters at Kelly, said Friday.
   Hirsch, an electrical engineer, voluntarily applied to leave the
Air Force and was granted an honorable discharge under an early
release program, Wiggins said.
   The case was handled by the Air Force Office of Special
Investigations, Wiggins said.
   The investigation of the Czechoslovak-born officer began in July
when polygraph examiners decided Hirsch wasn't telling the truth in
a routine security update. He was assigned to a communications unit
of the secretive Electronic Security Command, which collects
intelligence on Warsaw Pact radar and communications.
   A search of his apartment turned up records of $120,000 in bank
accounts, photographs of NATO military installations and classified
documents, according to Pentagon officials who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   He then was reassigned to the 6968th Alteration and Installation
Squadron at Kelly, where his duties didn't involve classified
projects.
   Hirsch was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, became a U.S. citizen
in 1971 and joined the Air Force in 1979.

   A Panamanian citizen who claims his
small plane was destroyed by gunfire during the U.S. invasion of
Panama sued the government for damages Friday, an attorney said.
   The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court on behalf of Luis
Alvarado claims his single-engine Cessna was destroyed when a U.S.
Army C-130 indiscrminately sprayed .50-caliber bullets Dec. 20 at
Paitilla Airport in Panama City.
   Alvarado, an employee of the Panama Canal, and other Panamanians
were invited by the U.S. Army to file claims after the invasion,
said his attorney, Michael O'Kane. Alvarado did file, but the Army
denied his claim, saying the damages resulted from an ``act of
war,'' the attorney said.
   ``In the Noriega case, the government claims that its actions in
Panama were not an act of war,'' O'Kane said, referring to the
federal drug-trafficking prosecution of deposed Panamanian ruler
Manuel Antonio Noriega. ``But when it comes time to pay, they tell
a different story.''
   The U.S. attorney's office in Miami didn't return phone calls
about the case Friday.
   O'Kane also represents Daniel Miranda, one of Noriega's
co-defendants in the Miami drug-trafficking case. Miranda, 36, is
accused of flying $800,000 in drug profits from Fort Lauderdale to
Panama in 1983.

   Vice President Dan Quayle will travel to South
America for presidential inaugurations in Chile and Brazil next
month. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., will join the delegation
going to Chile.
   Quayle also is expected during his March 9-16 trip to stop in
Argentina, Paraguay and Barbados to continue U.S. efforts to
overcome Latin resentment lingering from the U.S. invasion of
Panama in December. Many Latin countries still have not given
formal diplomatic recognition to the U.S.-installed government of
President Guillermo Endara.
   Quayle and Kennedy will attend the inauguration of Patricio
Aylwin on March 11 in Chile.
   Brazil holds its inauguration March 15, installing Fernando
Collar de Mello. Elected Dec. 20, Collor de Mello recently made a
pre-inaugural trip to Washington, where he met with both Quayle and
President Bush.
   Kennedy, who has long been interested in Chilean affairs, will
go only on that part of the trip.
   The Massachussetts senator, before meeting with the vice
president on Thursday, said he was delighted to be part of the
delegation.
   Chile's Dec. 14 elections marked a return of democracy to the
last South American nation still ruled by the military.
   This will mark Quayle's fourth trip to Latin America as vice
president. He traveled early this month to Panama to show support
for Endara's government, and to Jamaica and Honduras, where he met
with several heads of state.

   Police raided a South Side apartment Thursday and
captured two convicted murderers who escaped earlier this month
from the Joliet Correctional Center, authorities said.
   Acting on an informant's tip, police arrested James Allen, 40,
of Chicago, a three-time convicted killer serving a natural life
sentence, and Daniel Johnson, 24, of Burns, Tenn., who is serving
an 80-year sentence for murder, said spokesman Nic Howell of the
Illinois Department of Corrections.
   Allen and Johnson were among six inmates who escaped Feb. 11 in
the largest breakout in the history of the state prison system. Two
of the inmates have already been captured and two others remain at
large.
   ``We've been working on this case 24 hours a day ever since
these guys got out,'' Howell said. ``It's fine that they're off the
street and we're after the other two now.''
   About 35 Chicago police officers and three fugitive-apprehension
specialists from the Corrections Department took part in Thursday
afternoon's raid on the two-flat apartment building.
   ``Allen was arrested in the living room, and Johnson was walking
out the back door,'' Howelll said.
   The men were not armed and there was no resistance, the
spokesman said.
   Allen and Johnson were being held at a Chicago police station
and were to be returned to Joliet later Thursday, Howell said.
   The two inmates still at large are convicted murderer Dave
Rodriguez, 21, of Chicago, and burglar Ronald Roach, 20, of
Wyoming, Ill.
   Authorities had believed Allen and Johnson might have fled
Illinois. On Wednesday, the FBI announced it had entered the case
at the request of local authorities to help search for the
fugitives outside the state.
   On Friday, a jail guard, William Smith, 46, of Joliet, was
charged with aiding in the escape. Prosecutors said he gave inmates
a hacksaw blade used to cut cell bars.

   Former President Jose Napoleon
Duarte, whose quest for democracy in a society ruled by the
privileged few was thwarted by a disastrous civil war, died Friday
of cancer. He was 64.
   Duarte died at his home in the capital's fashionable San Benito
neighborhood, said Dr. Jose Luis Saca.
   Doctors at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington
diagnosed the cancer in May 1988 and removed 60 percent of Duarte's
stomach, but the disease had spread to his liver. They gave him
from six to 18 months to live.
   Duarte was president from 1984 to June 1989, when he was
succeeded by Alfredo Cristiani of the rightist Arena party, who was
supported by the oligarchy Duarte so long had fought.
   Nearly a generation ago, Duarte was arrested, beaten and exiled
for his fidelity to democracy. He called his inauguration in 1984
``a light in the long night of horror,'' and likened himself to
Moses delivering his people.
   His role in replacing an authoritarian, semifeudal system with
the beginnings of democracy was critical, but he finished his term,
and his life, burdened by failure, compromise, frustration and
dashed hopes.
   The war with the leftist Farabundo Marti Liberation Front is 10
years old. Poverty remains endemic in this small Central American
nation of 5 million people, whose economy depends on U.S. aid.
   In Washington, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater issued a
statement saying, ``President Duarte was the father of Salvadoran
democracy, a dedicated servant to the people of El Salvador, and a
firm friend of the United States.''
   The White House said Vice President Dan Quayle will fly to El
Salvador to lead the U.S. delegation at Duarte's funeral Sunday.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said, ``There could be no
more fitting tribute to his memory than for his countrymen to
follow his lead and to ensure that human rights and democratic
institutions grow and strengthen in the country he loved so deeply
and to which he gave so much.''
   A high-ranking U.S. diplomat who served in El Salvador during
most of Duarte's term said of him: ``He didn't work miracles, but
he must be credited with instituting the democratic system itself.
His great legacy is the transition. The rest pales by comparison.''
   Opponents criticized Duarte's bombast and messianic attitude;
supporters praised his idealism and fighting spirit. Both agree his
role in El Salvador was historic.
   ``One must acknowledge President Duarte's democratic vocation,''
Cristiani said just before taking office June 1. ``He has, with his
aptitude and positions, promoted the advance of democracy.''
   Duarte was born in San Salvador Nov. 23, 1925, the second of
three sons. His father was a tailor and his mother a dressmaker.
   Later, his father started a candy-making business that became
prosperous enough to put all three boys through college.
   Jose Napoleon became a Boy Scout and remained active in the
organization throughout his life.
   He was graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1948 with
a degree in civil engineering, married childhood friend Ines Duran,
and worked in her family's construction business. They had six
children.
   The barrel-chested engineer joined half a dozen other Roman
Catholic professionals in 1960 to found the Christian Democratic
Party. Most were young liberals hoping to put the church's social
doctrine into practice through government.
   After three terms as mayor of San Salvador, Duarte ran for
president in February 1972. He was winning handily when the army
stopped the count and declared its candidate the winner.
   A few weeks later, he supported a coup by a dissident military
faction. It failed. Duarte was arrested, beaten and told he would
be shot.
   He was allowed to leave the country instead and spent more than
seven years in Venezuela.
   Reform-minded military officers seized power in 1979 and Duarte
returned. He joined the junta in 1980 and became its president.
   Civil war began and the army and police embarked on a brutal
repression in which tens of thousands of people were killed, many
by ``death squads'' officially sanctioned or tolerated. Duarte was
criticized for presiding over terror, but he said things would be
worse were it not for his presence.
   In an effort to deprive the guerrillas of an issue, the junta
began what was envisioned as a radical land reform to break up
large farms and turn them into cooperatives.
   The reform was a partial political success, but eventually
bogged down because of organizational and production problems.
   When he was popularly elected in 1984, Duarte promised to bring
peace and prosperity. In three attempts at negotiations with the
leftist rebels, however, he did not budge from the demand that they
lay down their arms and join the political process.
   The guerrillas refused, but now are considering it in talks with
the Cristiani government.
   Mainly because of the war, the economy crumbled. The decline was
hastened by droughts and an earthquake in 1986 that killed an
estimated 1,500 people.
   U.S. economic and military aid reached nearly $2 million a day.
Opponents decried what they called the president's subservience to
the United States.
   Even his supporters cringed when Duarte kissed the U.S. flag at
a White House ceremony.
   In a speech in June 1988, Duarte gave this assessment of his
presidential term:
   ``The will of my people has caused me to navigate seas each day
more stormy and more dangerous because of crosscurrents. The
absence of fair winds and persistent adversity all along the route
have joined to prevent us from bringing about our high aims.''

   A retired funeral director who pulled a man in
a stalled wheelchair out of the path of a train in Oregon was among
19 Americans and Canadians recognized Thursday by the Carnegie Hero
Commission.
   ``I'm kind of elated. I've never been called a hero before,''
said Dale R. Layton, 65, of Canby, Ore.
   Layton is among 7,424 people honored by the commission since its
founding by Pittsburgh industrialist Andrew Carnegie in 1904. More
than $18.3 million has been awarded in one-time payments and
pensions to the heroes or their survivors.
   Five of those honored Thursday died in their rescue attempts.
   Layton had pulled into a coffee shop's parking lot on Nov. 17,
1988, when he heard a train whistle blowing non-stop. He turned and
saw the train bearing down on Lawrence Supnet, 28, of Portland,
whose battery-powered wheelchair had become stuck in the track at a
crossing.
   ``I turned and ran just as fast as I could run,'' Layton said in
a telephone interview. ``I just gave the chair one yank and tilted
it back. I bet it wasn't five heartbeats from the time I grabbed it
and the time the train was there.''
   Also recognized Thursday were 15 other Americans and three
Canadians:
   _Garry W. Proffit, 34, of Hollywood, Md., who drowned trying to
pull a man from a water storage tank in Lusby, Md., on Sept. 15,
1988.
   _Michael G. Martinez, 40, of Hialeah, Fla., who died of a heart
attack after saving an unidentified woman from drowning in the
Atlantic Ocean at Miami Beach, Fla., May 29, 1989.
   _John K. Aiena, 44, of Beaumont, Texas, who died trying to save
a man from drowning in a Port Arthur, Texas, marina May 26, 1989.
   _Betty B. Lamb, 69, of Sacramento, Calif., who died trying to
save her 3-year-old grandson from drowning in the Pacific Ocean
July 12, 1989, in Jenner, Calif. The child also died.
   _Keith A. Jensen, 33, of New Denmark, New Brunswick, who died
trying to save his parents from their burning home Jan. 31, 1988,
in New Brunswick.
   _James K. Webb of Fishkill, N.Y., and Richard Gustin of
Lagrangeville, N.Y., both 25. They helped rescue three men from a
burning car in Buchanan, N.Y., on April 11, 1989.

from two vehicles that caught fire after colliding in Antioch on
March 23, 1989.
   _Donald L. Dobson, 31, of Reading, Pa., who dragged a woman from
a burning apartment in Spring City, Pa., on May 26, 1988.

7-year-old boy from drowning in the Pacific Ocean at Oxnard,
Calif., on June 22, 1989.

<HEAD>Chattanooga Sues to Halt Showing of `Oh! Calcutta!'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's the second longest-running
musical in Broadway history, but if city officials get their way,
``Oh! Calcutta!'' won't have even one performance in Chattanooga.
   The city filed suit Thursday in Hamilton County Chancery Court
to block the showing of ``Oh! Calcutta!'' at the Tivoli Theater on
grounds it violates the state's obscenity law.
   The 10-page suit also claims the musical violates state and
local laws against indecent exposure and a local ordinance against
lewd and indecent conduct.
   A New Jersey promoter wants to stage the play May 2 or May 6 at
the Tivoli, but the theater is run by the city's Memorial
Auditorium Board, which last week voted against bringing in the
production.
   ``The auditorium board just wants to do what it feels is best
for the community and have shows that are in tune with community
tastes,'' said City Attorney Randy Nelson.
   The city is seeking judicial support for its action because the
Tivoli is publicly owned and can only deny use if an event violates
local laws or business criteria.
   With 5,959 performances, the revival of ``Oh! Calcutta!'' was
the longest-running musical on Broadway when it closed Sept. 24,
although it has since been passed by ``A Chorus Line.''
   The musical is now on a six-month tour of more than 90 cities,
including Nashville.
   Al Stewart, a press agent for the musical's promoter, Singer
Entertainment Consultants Ltd. Inc. of Port Murray, N.J., said the
play is art, not obscenity.
   ``Something that has been around for 21 years and has played in
15 countries before 60 million people, I wouldn't go that far ...
to say it is obscene,'' said Stewart. ``It is done in art. It's
theater.''
   No member of the Memorial Auditorium Board has seen the play,
said Tivoli Manager David Johnson, but they have read the script.
   ``The board felt the play violated local and state ordinances on
nudity and obscenity,'' Johnson said.
   The lawsuit contends the play's depiction of complete nudity and
simulated intercourse and other sexual acts would be obscene under
the state definition regarding community standards and offensive
sexual conduct.
   The lawsuit also says the nudity would violate state and local
laws against indecent exposure and the simulated sexual acts would
violate a city law against lewdness.
   In 1975, Chattanooga tried to stop production of the nude
musical ``Hair,'' but the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the ban,
saying the procedure by which the performance was halted fell short
of constitutional standards.

   A federal jury Thursday rejected a $25
million claim that pop star Stevie Wonder's Oscar-winning 1984 song
``I Just Called to Say I Love You'' was stolen from another
songwriter.
   The plaintiff, Lloyd Chiate, claimed Wonder's song, part of the
movie soundtrack for ``Woman in Red,'' was stolen from a song he
co-wrote titled, ``I Just Called To Say.''
   ``I knew the truth in my heart all along,'' said Wonder, who
attended the two-week trial and testified on his own behalf. ``I'm
very sorry a lot of people had to spend a lot of precious time in
this courtroom. But I do appreciate and respect justice.''
   Wonder offered to try to smooth over the dispute by writing a
song with Chiate and Lee Garrett, co-author of ``I Just Called To
Say,'' and donate the proceeds to charity.
   ``Then we all really win,'' Wonder said. ``It is far easier to
love than to hate.''
   Chiate, 40, sued Wonder in 1985 under the superstar's real name,
Steveland Morris, for copyright infringement, claiming that Wonder
pilfered ``I Just Called To Say,'' co-written by Lee Garrett, after
Wonder heard the song in 1977.
   Wonder, 39, denied stealing the song, which won an Academy Award
in 1984. He said he wrote ``I Just Called to Say I Love You'' long
before hearing the Chiate-Garrett composition and without any
influence from the song.
   Chiate wasn't present when the jury announced its verdict. His
attorney said his client was wronged by a star-struck jury and a
biased judge who had originally dismissed the lawsuit but was
overruled by an appeals court.
   ``I don't think that Mr. Chiate ever got a fair trial,'' said
lawyer Herbert Dodell. ``The result was inevitable, a terrible
miscarriage of justice.''
   Jury foreman Robert Apfelzweig, 39, a research scientist from
Pasadena, said the jury didn't find any evidence that Wonder had
access to the Chiate-Garrett song and the two songs were ``quite
dissimilar.''
   ``Mr. Chiate's case started weak and got weaker,'' said
Apfelzweig.
   Chiate contended that Wonder first had access to Chiate and
Garrett's music during the summer of 1977, when Garrett played
Wonder a tape recording of his music after the latter had talked
Garrett out of committing suicide one night.
   Garrett and Wonder are boyhood friends. Garrett originally was
named as a plaintiff in the suit, but he dropped out and testified
for Wonder.
   Wonder testified in the courtroom of U.S. District Judge David
W. Williams that he wrote much of ``I Just Called to Say I Love
You'' on July 16, 1976, while being driven from his mother's San
Fernando Valley home.
   It was at least a year, perhaps two, before he heard the song
Chiate and Garrett wrote, he said.
   Wonder said that he later polished and recorded ```I Just Called
to Say I Love You,'' which became a big hit and also won a Grammy.

   Nine people were rescued from a shallow
reef early Thursday, 12 hours after their dive boat rolled over and
sank in stormy seas. Rescuers said their survival was a tribute to
cool heads and warm wet suits.
   The six passengers and three crew members aboard the 28-foot
Diamond Girl were dumped in 70-foot-deep water at 5 p.m. Wednesday.
A Coast Guard patrol boat picked them up in darkness.
   The nine were left clinging to a webbed-bottom flotation ring
and said they propelled the raft through four miles of six- to
eight-foot waves to the barrier reef they knew lay ahead, said
Chief Petty Officer Charles Kemnitz.
   No one was injured.
   One of the passengers, Dave Kirkham, 29, of Ringwood, N.J., said
he and dive master Graham Green, 22, were underwater when they
spotted the boat sinking.
   ``Then we saw a scuba tank and then there's the boat about 50 to
60 feet away,'' he said. ``We bolted to the boat to see who could
be in it.''
   They grabbed life vests, a first-aid kit and a strobe light
before heading for the surface.
   Coast Guard Petty Officer Alex Worden said the crew thought the
vessel began taking on water when packing around the propeller
shaft came loose. The craft then rolled over when it was hit by a
big wave, he said.
   ``It went down very, very quickly,'' said Diamond Girl Capt.
Craig Eubank, 28.
   The Coast Guard began a search after getting a call about 8:30
p.m. Wednesday from a passenger's girlfriend, who said the boat was
overdue.
   A patrol boat spotted them at about 5 a.m., bobbing on the
wave-swept reef about five miles from Key West.
   The water over the reef was about two feet deep, but waves six
feet high swept through, periodically lifting the castaways off
their feet, officials said.
   ``They didn't have time to get a (distress) call out,'' said
Kemnitz.
   ``They were all divers, so they were all probably cool-headed
people to begin with. They had a dive master with them, plus an
experienced captain.''
   The six passengers and a crew member all wore wet suits, which
retain body heat and protect against coral cuts, Kemnitz said.
   ``I'm sure that helped a lot,'' he said. ``Two of the people,
the only two who didn't have wet suits, were in the raft while the
rest were in the water holding on to its side.''

   Police roped off beaches and warned the
public to stay away on Thursday after six plastic bottles of deadly
potassium cyanide were found washed up on the southern English
coast.
   The affected area stretches from the holiday resort of Brighton
to Newhaven, 15 miles to the east.
   The bottles, along with 10 more containing harmless chemicals,
are thought to have been washed overboard from a ship buffeted by
recent heavy storms in the English Channel. The first bottles were
discovered Wednesday.
   In a statement to news media, Brighton police warned the public:
``Don't go anywhere near the containers. You won't get a second
chance if one is leaking.'' Potassium cyanide can kill if inhaled
at close range.
   As police and a coast guard helicopter patrolled the shoreline
looking for more of the nine-inch-long white bottles, firemen in
protective clothing and breathing apparatus began clearing those
already found.
   Police roped off all holiday beaches on the stretch of coast
where the bottles were found and told the public to stay clear
while the search and recovery operation continues.
   Martin Fitzgerald, a spokesman for East Sussex county council,
said the bottles containing potassium cyanide bear the chemical's
symbol, KCn, and its United Nations identification code, 1680.
   News reports quoted John Vass, secretary of a chemical company,
BDH Ltd., of Poole in southwest England, as saying labels on the
bottles indicated they came from there.
   The London Times quoted Vass as saying the company believed the
six bottles were part of a shipment to Saudi Arabia that left
England in late January and was due to arrive in Saudi Arabia March
2.
   Vass was quoted as saying his company's total potassium cyanide
shipment had been 16 of the 1.1-pound bottles for use in laboratory
testing.

<HEAD>British Petroleum Submits Final Cleanup Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Petroleum officials on Thursday
presented the Coast Guard with a plan for finishing clean-up of 12
miles of Southern California beach tarred by a spill of crude oil
from a tanker.
   Company spokesman Jim Marino refused to provide details of the
plan, which he said sets a ``preliminary timetable'' for reopening
beaches closed by the Feb. 7 spill of 400,000 gallons of oil from
the tanker American Trader.
   City, state and federal authorities must approve the plan before
it is put into effect, Marino said.
   Even as oil was being cleaned from the beaches, state attorneys
planned legal strategy for recovering damages from the tanker's
owner and operator.
   An official with the state attorney general's office said both
British Petroleum, which chartered the American Trader, and
American Trading and Transportation Co., which owns the vessel,
could be held liable for damages caused by the spill off Huntington
Beach south of Los Angeles.
   ``We've yet to decide who to sue, but under state law both the
transporter and the owner of the oil are liable for damages,'' said
deputy attorney general Sylvia Cano Hale.
   Hale said she expected local officials to provide their damage
assessments by April. How much money will be sought from the
companies had yet to be determined, she said.
   Investigators believe the tanker was punctured by its own anchor
as it maneuvered in shallow water two miles offshore to discharge
its cargo into a submerged pipeline that leads to a refinery on
shore.
   British Petroleum demonstrated two sand cleanup technologies
intended to eliminate residual oil that may have penetrated beaches
above the high-tide line along six miles of coast.
   One device, dubbed a ``beach sanitizer,'' resembles a Zamboni
ice-rink grooming machine, except that it lifts and sifts sand,
Marino said. The other employs a drag line that unearths sand
beneath the surface so workers can remove buried oil residue.
   Clean-up crews continued to use pressurized warm water to clean
rock faces at Bolsa Chica State Beach and the Newport Bay jetties.
   In all, 370 workers continued cleanup along 14 miles of coast,
British Petroleum said.
   The 811-foot American Trader arrived in San Francisco Thursday,
where it will undergo repairs to the damaged hull, said Coast Guard
Lt. Jay Ellis said.

   State Treasurer Ann Richards on Thursday
accused Democratic gubernatorial opponent Jim Mattox of planting an
article in a Hispanic-oriented newspaper that alleged she used an
ethnically derogatory term.
   Tiempo, a Waco-based weekly, published an article Thursday
alleging that Ms. Richards referred to illegal aliens as
``wetbacks'' in a speech text written during her successful
campaign for Travis County commissioner in 1976.
   Ms. Richards, whose no-holds-barred oratory drew wide attention
at the Democratic National Convention in 1988, denied using the
term.
   ``Mattox has always got other people to do his dirty work when
he could,'' Ms. Richards told The Associated Press.
   Mattox' press secretary, Kelly Fero, denied that the campaign
had any connection with the article.
   ``We did not plant this story with anybody. We know nothing
about this story. And that's all we have to say about it,'' Fero
said.
   Recent polls have shown Ms. Richards leading the Democratic
primary field and Mattox running third behind former Gov. Mark
White in the race to the March 13 primary election. Mattox and Ms.
Richards, however, have run a particularly heated campaign against
each other.
   Republican Gov. Bill Clements isn't seeking a another term.
   Ernesto Fraga, publisher and author of the article, said he
personally supports Mattox but that had nothing to do with the
story.
   ``If any other candidate had written something like this, I
would have printed it,'' Fraga said.
   Fraga made available to the AP a facsimile copy of the two-page,
handwritten speech text on which he based his article, but declined
to say how he had obtained it. Above the text is what appears to be
Ms. Richards' letterhead.
   A sentence in the text said: ``If it takes a man to hire
non-union labor, cross picket lines and work wetbacks then I say
thank God for a woman or anyone else who is willing to take over.''
   Shown a copy of the Tiempo story and the paper's reproduction of
two sentences from the handwritten text, Ms. Richards said that the
opening sentence of the text was her handwriting, but the sentence
containing the word ``wetbacks'' wasn't.
   ``I can't tell you any more than what you can see here, that
there are obviously two handwritings and that Jim Mattox's
supporters put that out,'' Ms. Richards said.
   Ms. Richards came under similar criticism after a debate in
Houston earlier this month, when she was heard by some to say, ``No
legislator, no judge and no bureaucrat has any business in
determining whether a white woman has an abortion or not.''
   Ms. Richards has insisted she was misunderstood, that she said
``why a woman'' rather than ``white woman.''

<HEAD>Cambodian Premier Says Talks Encouraged Peace Process</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said
Thursday his talks with guerrilla leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk
may have produced a basis for a peace settlement soon.
   The two leaders met in Bangkok Wednesday for talks sponsored by
Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan.
   ``We can regard this meeting as a success,'' Hun Sen told
reporters before leaving for home. ``Because of the existence of
such a basis, we will have some light of hope for peace in the near
future.''
   Hun Sen's remarks were translated into English by an aide. He
did not elaborate or take questions from reporters.
   His government, installed by Vietnam after a late 1978 invasion
of Cambodia, is fighting a coalition of three guerrilla groups led
by Sihanouk, former ruler of the country.
   A joint communique issued Wednesday hinted at some progress in
the talks but was vaguely worded and did not appear to contain any
new concessions.
   On Thursday, the Khmer Rouge guerrilla group cited what it said
were three recent battlefield operations it launched ``in
cooperation with'' Sihanouk guerrillas.
   Sihanouk, criticized for his ties with the fanatical group, has
denied any such cooperation existed. The Khmer Rouge killed
hundreds of thousands of people in agrarian revolution when it
ruled Cambodia before Vietnam invaded and installed another
government.
   The Khmer Rouge army radio, monitored in Bangkok, said the two
forces cooperated in attacking government positions in northwestern
Siem Reap province in one operation on Feb. 14 and two operations
on Feb. 15.
   It did not specify the nature of the cooperation in the strikes,
but said 15 government soldiers were killed, war materiel was
seized or destroyed, and villages were ``liberated.''
   The Hun Sen-Sihanouk communique said a U.N. presence ``at
appropriate levels in Cambodia is essential and should be
encouraged.'' It did not say how far they accepted an Australian
proposal for the United Nations to administer the country pending a
national election.
   It also said they wanted a ``supreme national body'' that would
symbolize national unity, but gave no details.
   Both leaders dodged the question of whether the body would
include the Khmer Rouge, the largest guerrilla group, whose future
role has been the major stumbling block in negotiations.
   Hun Sen and Sihanouk agreed to meet again in coming months, and
expressed hope that wider peace talks next week in Indonesia will
make enough progress to allow resumption of the international
conference on Cambodia in Paris. That conference has been suspended
since last August.
   Sihanouk will not go to Jakarta. Instead, he will cross into
northwestern Cambodia on Friday to end a decade of exile and live a
guerrilla-controlled zone in the northwest until a political
settlement, his spokesman said.
   The Khmer People's National Liberation Front, which is allied
with Sihanouk's forces, has reported a large-scale government
counteroffensive since Monday against positions taken by guerrillas
in recent weeks.
   Fighting was fierce as government forces on Wednesday attacked a
Liberation Front base in the northwestern district of Sisophon, the
guerrilla radio said.
   Resistance officials and Thai military officers said government
forces also struck Monday and Tuesday near Svay Chek, a gateway to
Sisophon.
   Ok Serei Sopheak, a spokesman for the Liberation Front high
command, said the 1,300 attacking soldiers were backed by rocket
launchers, heavy artillery and at least six Soviet-made T-54 tanks.
   He said the guerrillas held onto Svay Chek, killed 49 soldiers
and wounded 20.

   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel sampled New
York City's attractions Thursday while meeting with politicians,
religious leaders, American writers and some pint-sized compatriots.
   Breakfast with Mayor David Dinkins was the first stop on a busy
schedule that included meetings with the Council on Foreign
Relations, Czechoslovak-Americans and U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar and stops to pick up academic and religious honors.
   All that followed a tour of some East Village hangouts Wednesday
night shortly after his arrival with Czechoslovak-born filmmaker
Milos Forman.
   During his visit Thursday morning to Gracie Mansion, the mayor's
official residence, Havel met writers Kurt Vonnegut, Edward Albee
and Arthur Miller.
   Afterward, he spoke with reporters about the ``extremely strange
and extraordinary'' circumstances that resulted in his being
elevated from dissident playwright to president. But, he added, it
was not a job he coveted.
   ``I didn't want to be a president. But I was raised to the post
by public pressure,'' he said.
   Havel was elected president Dec. 29 by the Czechoslovak
Parliament a few weeks after a peaceful revolution that led to the
ouster of a hard-line Communist government. Elections are scheduled
for June.
   The breakfast meeting proved fruitful, professionally and
personally, after producer Joseph Papp announced he was going to
produce Havel's play ``Slum Clearance'' and the president received
an invitation from Dinkins to come back to New York when he can
spend more time.
   ``I like New York very much. I hope soon I will not be a
president and accept Mr. Mayor's invitation,'' said Havel.
   Havel's last visit was in 1968 for opening night of one of his
plays.
   Havel's next stop was the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where he
was greeted by two dozen flag-waving, cheering kids from the
Czechoslovak School for children of Czechoslovak diplomats.
   ``For us the changes in our country are very exciting. But we're
so far from home. This is our way of keeping in touch, with him and
with our countrymen,'' said teacher Lida Husek.
   Havel met with religious leaders at the residence of Roman
Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor's. He received an honorary degree
from Columbia University and later attended an evening concert in
his honor at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.
   Paul Simon and Roberta Flack sang, and Zubin Mehta conducted the
Brooklyn Philharmonic. There were readings, some from Havel's own
speeches, by about a dozen actors and writers including Ellen
Burstyn, Gregory Peck and Saul Bellow.
   Many speakers expressed joy and wonder that a playwright and
former political prisoner now leads a nation.
   ``Vaclav Havel has shown the world that art matters,'' said
actor Ron Silver. ``Help us overcome our cynicism and let us bask
in the glory and joy of an artist leading us.''
   In receiving the honorary degree, Havel recalled giving a speech
at Columbia in 1968, when the Vietnam protest movement was in full
swing in this country. Though the students were on strike, they
attended the speech, Havel said, adding that experiencing the
America of the late 1960s was part of his political education.
   ``The atmosphere of that time very much inspired me, influenced
me,'' Havel said.
   At a pre-concert reception, Havel marveled at meeting actor Paul
Newman, president of the Actors Studio, which last year performed
the Havel play, ``Audience.''
   ``Mr. Newman, whom I know many years from movies, who is such
big legend that I didn't believe he physically exists,'' he said.
``Now I'm standing here with him.''
   The Czechoslovak president and his wife, Olga Havlova, arrived
in the United States on Monday. He addressed Congress and met with
President Bush twice before traveling to New York on Wednesday. He
was to return home Friday.

   Britain's Prince Charles told leading American
architects Thursday night that ``much of the commercial building of
today bears as much relations to architecture as advertising
slogans bear to literature.''
   The 41-year-old heir to the British throne urged planners,
developers and designers to remember that buildings exist primarily
for human beings.
   ``The time has surely now arrived when we must learn to work
with rather than against nature, when we can once again make places
in which to live and work which are more than machines,'' he said.
   Charles laid down his challenge at a black-tie, $250-a-plate
awards dinner of the American Institute of Architects where he was
the star attraction. A sold-out audience of 1,200 architects,
members of Congress, diplomats and Hollywood celebrities heard him
warn that the world's cities are becoming ``the epitome of the
throwaway society.''
   ``If that comes about ... then I shall be proud to be considered
old fashioned, reactionary, antediluvian, anachronistic,'' he
continued.
   The architects came to the glittering National Building Museum
anticipating some sharp barbs from Charles about the state of
modern architecture.
   He did not disappoint them, noting that their welcome might be a
sign that ``an epidemic of masochism (is) sweeping the ranks of the
AIA.''
   Earlier, after lunching with President Bush, the prince attended
an architectual exhibit where he was hailed as ``Our Knight in
Shining Armor'' because of is support for traditional architecture.
   Emerging from his limousine on the steps of the historic Octagon
House, the Prince of Wales was obviously delighted to be met by a
cluster of placards whose slogans included: ``Hurrah Prince
Charles,'' and ``Humane Architecture _ Happy People.''
   ``He saw the sign, `Shining Knight in Armor,' and he said, ``Gee
Whiz,'' said Thomas J. Eyerman, a member of the Board of Regents of
the American Architectural Foundation, one of the sponsors of the
event.
   ``He was absolutely shocked that in America that people would
have signs talking about architecture, calling him a shining knight
in armor,'' Eyerman said.
   The pro-prince demonstrators told reporters they represented
organizations that fought a long and ultimately unsuccessful fight
to save Washington's historic Rhodes Tavern from demolition.
   The prince's objective at Octagon House, used as a temporary
executive mansion by President James Madison after the British army
burned the White House in 1814, was to view an exhibit
commemorating the design of London's St. Paul's Cathedral by the
leading British architect of the 17th century, Sir Christopher Wren.
   Octagon House, built in 1800, is now a museum of the American
Institute of Architects. Charles married his wife, Diana, in St.
Paul's in 1981.
   The prince reacted to the layout of architectural renderings and
models with animation, looking at each exhibit closely, pointing
out details and asking questions of one of his guides, Eric Evans,
dean of St. Paul's.
   The works on display have never before been assembled as a unit
and the prince was quoted by architects with whom he spoke as
hoping they also could be shown in London.
   As the prince was inspecting the exhibit, America's leading
architects gathered at a glittering black-tie gala for a royal
critique of their work.
   On a chill, drizzly day, the 41-year-old heir to the British
throne dined in the White House family quarters with Bush and Vice
President Dan Quayle.
   The other luncheon guests included Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, British Ambassador Sir Antony
Acland and Henry Catto, U.S. ambassador to London.
   Bush escorted Charles down a red carpet to his Rolls-Royce
limousine after lunch and shook hands with the prince, who wore a
dark gray, double-breasted pinstripe suit.
   The busy schedule for Charles' one-day Washington visit also
included an embassy reception for alumni of the Marshall Scholars
program, under which the British government pays all costs for
exceptional American students to spend two or three years at
British universities.
   Later, Charles was the star attraction at a sold-out awards
banquet for 1,200 architects, members of Congress, diplomats,
Supreme Court justices and Hollywood celebrities at the National
Building Museum.
   The prince's dinner speech gave him another opportunity to
criticize the worst examples of modern architecture and appeal to
his audience to design more attractive, comfortable buildings that
are scaled to human needs and respect the surrounding landscape.
   Back home, Charles has angered some architects but won the
applause of much of the British public with his contention that the
London skyline has suffered more damage from architects, city
planners and developers than from German bombers in World War II.
   In ``A Vision of Britain,'' a book he published last year,
Charles accused some modern architects of creating ``Frankenstein
monsters, devoid of character, alien and largely unloved.'' He says
some new buildings in London remind him of word processors or
nuclear power plants.
   Honored at the banquet was architect Fay Jones of Fayetteville,
Ark., a former pupil of Frank Lloyd Wright who won the AIA's
prestigious Gold Medal. Bush presented the award to Jones at a
White House ceremony after the lunch for Charles.
   The prince will end a weeklong U.S. tour on Friday, when he
meets with American environmental experts at the British Embassy
before he returns to London.
   Charles began his visit last weekend by playing in two benefit
polo matches at Vero Beach, Fla. He met Wednesday with 100
corporate executives in Charleston, S.C., to promote private
investment in poor urban neighborhoods and plead for business
cooperation in protecting the environment.

<HEAD>Church Officials Condemn Ordination of Gay Priest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN LEVIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After two months of official silence, the
Episcopal Church's presiding bishop said a Newark colleague was
wrong to ordain a practicing homosexual who later made embarrassing
remarks about Jesus Christ and Mother Teresa.
   The Rev. Edmond L. Browning, who has refrained from comment on
the ordination of J. Robert Williams, released a statement to
church officials critical of the ordination handled by Newark
Bishop John S. Spong.
   In the statement made public this week, Browning, the top
Episcopal official in the United States, said he and his Council of
Advice ``disassociate'' themselves from the ordination, but not
from ``the many members of our church who are gay and lesbian.''
   Williams raised controversy five weeks after his Dec. 16
ordination by belittling church teachings on celibacy and monogamy
in a speech.
   He has told reporters he believed Christ had a gay lover and has
implied that Mother Teresa would be better off if she had sex.
   Williams, 34, told a Detroit church panel in January that
monogamy and celibacy are ``unnatural'' and made the remark about
Mother Teresa, a Roman Catholic nun who has received a Nobel Prize
for her work with the poor, in response to questions from a church
official.
   The remark about Christ was made to a church group in Texas.
   Conservative church critics have demanded Spong's resignation,
saying he violated a church resolution against admitting practicing
homosexuals to the clergy.
   Until Williams' controversial remarks, Spong had defended the
ordination as a way to make the church more inclusive. But after
the remarks were publicized, Spong asked Williams to keep silent
and refrain from functioning as a priest while the diocese
investigates whether Williams misrepresented his views during the
lengthy ordination process.
   National church spokesman Jim Solheim said the bishops objected
to the way Spong heralded his intention to ordain an openly gay
priest, thus polarizing the church community as a result.
   ``Practicing gays have been ordained before, but very quietly.
The objection to Spong is to his style, it's to the way he did
it,'' Solheim said.
   Spong, who is on sabbatical until March 1, was unavailable for
comment.

   Legal challenges to the state's urban
pesticide spraying program cropped up like pesky Medflies on
Thursday as officials in Los Angeles, Burbank, Glendale and
Pasadena moved to stop the rain of malathion.
   Under orders from the Los Angeles City Council, City Attorney
James Hahn filed a Superior Court lawsuit seeking an immediate halt
to the helicopter missions to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly.
   The lawsuit, filed jointly with the cities of Burbank and
Glendale, seeks a court order halting the spraying missions. It
names Gov. George Deukmejian, the state Department of Food and
Agriculture, department director Henry Voss and the County Board of
Supervisors as defendants.
   It alleges the malathion missions violate residents' civil
rights because the public has a right to be free of toxic chemical
risks to their health.
   Agriculture officials maintain the pesticide is safe and warn
that the Medfly, if established, could produce annual losses of
$200 million to the state's agricultural industry.
   The lawsuit also contends that the agriculture department has
violated pest eradication statutes requiring that non-pesticide
alternatives be used before officials resort to spraying. In
addition, the chopper sorties violate public nuisance regulations
by creating excessive noise and damaging property, the suit alleges.
   The city of Pasadena planned to file an amicus brief supporting
the lawsuit.
   Deukmejian met in Pasadena on Thursday with Pasadena and
Glendale city officials, but the discussion yielded no agreements
on the pesticide program or on a provocative new Pasadena ordinance
prohibiting low-level helicopter flights at night.
   The Republican governor said he was confident the cities' suits
would fail, adding,``The courts have consistently supported the
position taken by the state.''
   Meanwhile, the private Natural Resources Defense Council and a
host of state legislators filed a second Superior Court action
challenging Deukmejian's state of emergency decree enabling
officials to spray the Medfly-killing pesticide over 400 square
miles of Los Angeles and Orange Counties.
   Helicopters were to take to the skies again Thursday night to
blanket a 30-square-mile area of the Verdugo hills in Burbank and
Glendale as part of the state's $30 million Medfly eradication
campaign.
   In Pasadena, City Attorney Victor Kaleta said he was awaiting a
police report that could enable him to file criminal misdemeanor
complaints against six helicopter pilots who conducted a spraying
mission over the city early Thursday.
   The private pesticide sortie entered city air space at 12:55
a.m. Thursday. It was tracked flying at 500 feet, violating a new
city ordinance that bans helicopterr flights below 700 feet.
   A police helicopter pilot contacted the formation, informed its
pilots they were violating the ordinance, and ordered them to cease
and desist. The pilots acknowledged they were in violation but
continued spraying.
   The police pilot flew to the helicopter base at El Monte and
informed the pilots that police would seek the complaints, said Lt.
Gregg Henderson.
   With sufficient evidence, Katela said his office could file
complaints possibly next week. The maximum penalty for violating
the ordinance is a $1,000 fine and a year in jail.
   But the Federal Aviation Administration has said that only it
can enforce laws regarding civil air traffic, and attorneys from
the agency have met with Katela, said FAA spokeswoman Elly Brekke.
   ``We told him it was our interpretation that their ordinance was
preempted by federal law,'' said Brekke, citing the supremacy
clause of the U.S. Constitution.
   She said that under rules regarding crop dusting aircraft and
aircraft for hire, ``There is no minimum altitude at which they
must fly. The rules say the pilot must fly the helicopter in such a
way that if there were an emergency aboard the aircraft, the pilot
would be able to land the aircraft safely,'' said Brekke.
   ``The bottom line is that the altitude is at the pilot's
discretion,'' she said.
   In addition to the Los Angeles lawsuit, the Orange County cities
of Garden Grove, Huntington Beach and Westminster have sued in
Superior Court.
   A judge refused their request to stop spraying immediately, but
ordered the state to provide more information on malathion.
   The Legal Aid Society of Orange County filed suit in federal
court, arguing the spraying violates the civil rights of homeless
people who are unable to take health precautions if they are doused
with pesticide.
   The Medfly lays its eggs in more than 250 varieties of fruits,
vegetables and nuts grown in California. The crops are destroyed
when the larvae hatch and growing maggots eat their way out.

   An Ariane rocket carrying two
Japanese communications satellites exploded just after liftoff,
prompting the competitor to the U.S. space shuttle to suspend
future flights.
   The unmanned Ariane 44-L rocket, powered by four strap-on
boosters, blew apart Thursday, apparently from a fire in the
propulsion system, Arianespace President Frederic D'Allest said at
the launch site.
   ``All Ariane flights are suspended until we discover the reasons
of this accident,'' he said. ``We are going to analyze this failure
and explain the catastrophe of this flight as rapidly as possible.''
   The failure came after 17 straight successful launches of the
Ariane. The two satellites alone were insured for more than $200
million.

   The 1980s ended with the lowest annual traffic
death rate ever, capping a decade in which many Americans declared
war on drunken driving and began using long-neglected safety belts,
federal officials say.
   The 1989 fatality rate was 2.2 deaths per 100 million miles
traveled, down from 2.3 the previous year and one-third lower than
the 1980 rate of 3.3, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration reported.
   Fatalities in 1989 are estimated at 45,500, compared with 47,093
in 1988. Final numbers for last year are still being tallied but
are unlikely to change significantly, officials said.
   ``The reduction in traffic deaths during the 1980s reflects our
national resolve against drunk driving, increased safety belt use
and a generally heightened awareness of highway safety,''
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said Thursday.

   A record medical malpractice award is
causing some West Virginia obstetricians to turn away new patients
and consider leaving the state, where their ranks already have been
halved in five years.
   ``Some will probably leave if they get a chance. I would
leave,'' Dr. Ujjal Sandhu said Thursday. ``I don't want to worry
about losing my shirt. The patients will have to go out of state
just like the doctors are leaving.''
   A county jury in Charleston last week awarded a couple $15.25
million after they claimed their obstetrician failed to perform a
Caesarean section to prevent brain damage to their newborn. It was
the state's highest malpractice award against an obstetrician.
   Mark and Julie Robinson of Cabin Creek, about 15 miles east of
Charleston, said Dr. Kanoj K. Biswas, a Charleston obstetrician,
should have performed the Caesarean section on July 31, 1987, after
their son became stuck in the birth canal.

   Czechoslovak president Vaclav Havel dashed
around Manhattan, receiving a hero's welcome from writers and
artists, hobnobbing with punk rockers and meeting a ``legend'' _
Paul Newman.
   ``I've been in the presence of some great artists and I've been
in the presence of some great statesmen, but I've never before been
in the presence of a great artist-statesman,'' Newman said Thursday
at a reception for Havel.
   With the wit and self-deprecation that typified the comments he
made in broken English in his one-day whirl around the city, Havel
called Newman ``such a big legend that I didn't believe he
physically exists. Now I'm standing here with him.''
   The Czechoslovak Parliament elected Havel president a few weeks
after a peaceful revolution in December that led to the ouster of a
hard-line Communist government. That regime had jailed Havel for
five years for his satirical plays and other activism.

   Up the street a barker holds open the door
for a peek at the nude dancer grinding away on a table top. Another
show is advertised as the French Orgy, and the sign at the female
impersonators' club says, ``boys will be girls.''
   Music blasts from the bars and the T-shirt shops. Tourists dance
in the street, drinks in hand.
   Bourbon Street is in full swing, and so is the Gospel and Blues
Tent where Sherman Washington and the Zion Harmonizers are raising
their voices in tight harmony while the crowd raises theirs in
approval.
   ``It's wonderful. The people really get into it. They shout and
carry on. It's a real joy,'' said Washington.
   After years in churches and concert halls, gospel has found a
new home in a cabaret setting on Bourbon Street. The same people
who pay to hear Dixieland and Cajun pay to hear the traditional
black religious music.
   ``It's sure not church, but I think everyone has a good time
listening to us,'' Washington said.
   Accompanied by a guitar and drums _ and sometimes keyboards,
tambourine and base _ the Zion Harmonizers sing the same songs you
can hear in black churches and tents across the United States.
   The hand-clapping music, an integral part of New Orleans'
musical heritage, includes many of the standards such as ``Closer
Walk,'' but other numbers are less well known.
   ``We have our own way of singing; our own style of harmonizing.
You can't listen to it long without clapping your hands. It's what
you would call an upbeat sound,'' Washington said.
   The introduction of gospel to rowdy Bourbon Street was made this
winter by Ian Hardcastle, a white Canadian who doesn't sing it and
didn't even know about it a decade ago.
   ``I'd never seen a gospel group. Then in 1972 I visited the Jazz
Fest and heard it for the first time. That alone made me want to
move to New Orleans,'' Hardcastle said.
   A real estate developer who restored historic buildings in
Canada, Hardcastle moved south to live part-time in 1987. He now
divides his time between the French Quarter and Toronto.
   Hardcastle's love of gospel produced the Blues and Gospel Tent
on the site of the old Pete Fountain club.
   For a $3 cover, fans can listen to gospel from 8 p.m. to 10
p.m., and to the blues from 10 p.m. to midnight. The tent, which is
actually a large enclosed courtyard, serves mixed drinks but no
food, although a Sunday gospel brunch is being added.
   ``It might seem a little funny to some people to have us singing
gospel in a place like Bourbon Street, but, who knows, maybe it
gets a different kind of spirit into folks. The Lord works in
mysterious ways and I don't think he minds us making music
whereever we are,'' said Washington.
   Although Washington, 63, developed his music in church and the
Zion Harmonizers were started by a Baptist minister, their
performances and those of the other groups that play at the tent
are strictly that _ performances.
   Washington knew the potential: He is one of the organizers of
the gospel tent, the always crowded arena at the annual New Orleans
Jazz and Heritage Festival. Three New Orleans gospel choirs rotate
at the club.
   ``It's not religious. I don't have a pulpit up front. I don't
think people come here for religion. I think they come for the
music, but what they get out of it is up to them,'' Hardcastle said.
   After 10 p.m., such groups as the Zion Harmonizers give way to
singers such as Irma Thomas and Marva Wright and the blues.
   ``It's an easy transition,'' Hardcastle said. ``I think both are
sort of the roots of American music.''
   And if tourists feel more comfortable with the blues when they
start out, gospel seems to be gaining ground with them.
   ``I see them being sort of stiff when we start out, but before
you know it everybody is moving and tapping their feet with us.
Their bodies just start in doing it before they know what's going
on,'' said Washington.

   ``Bit by bit, putting it together, bit by bit,
only way to make a work of art.''
   These lyrics, from Stephen Sondheim's ``Sunday in the Park With
George,'' have a special resonance in London these days, as the
Royal National Theater puts together the British bow of one of the
most haunting and innovative musicals of the 1980s.
   ``Sunday in the Park'' dared to dramatize the artist's
imagination in a show that couldn't be more removed from mainstream
Broadway fare. It won the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for drama, a rare
accolade for a musical.
   Sondheim promised that the British version will be very
different. The composer-lyricist was recently in Britain, where he
talked about the new production with students at Oxford University.
   The New York show starred Mandy Patinkin as Georges Seurat, the
French pointillist master whose 1884-86 painting, ``A Sunday
Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte,'' is the musical's
centerpiece.
   Australian performer Philip Quast inherits the part in London,
opposite Maria Friedman as Seurat's mistress, Dot, a role
originated by Bernadette Peters on Broadway.
   Its Broadway director, librettist James Lapine, has turned to
movies, so the show, which opens March 15 at the National's
Lyttelton auditorium, is being staged by Steven Pimlott, a
Cambridge graduate best known for directing opera and the classics.
   In an interview before starting rehearsals, Pimlott said his
task was ``to embrace on the one hand Seurat's painting and on the
other the traditions of the Broadway musical.''
   He and designer Tom Cairns flew to the United States in October
to see the canvas at the Art Institute of Chicago.
   He did it for the creative stimulus. ``I'd have felt very odd
doing this piece not having seen the painting,'' Pimlott said.
   ``It's a fabulous picture, a fun picture not least because the
Chicago Art Institute makes so much of it. I think (Seurat's)
`Bathers at Asnieres' is at least as good a painting, but we don't
make quite as much of a fuss at the National Gallery.''
   The first act of the musical takes place over a series of
Sundays from 1884 to 1886 as Seurat works on his painting, using
his distinctive style of dabbing dots of color onto the canvas so
that when viewed from a distance they will form a picture.
   It ends with a memorable theatrical flourish as the actors
position themselves like the figures on the canvas.
   The second act, set in present-day New York, invents a
great-grandson for Seurat, an artist also named George, suffering
the double burden of an imposing ancestry and creative blockage.
   Trying to emulate his great-grandfather's genius with color and
light, George invents a ``chromolume,'' a bizarre contraption that
ricochets laser-beams around the theater.
   This second act was problematic _ ``the infamous second act,''
jokes Pimlott _ because some Broadway audiences weren't sure
whether this experiment in high-tech pointillism was a serious
artistic statement or a joke. So Pimlott has turned his George into
a performance artist working with humans, not machines.
   He has hired Martin Duncan, a well-known actor-director in
British ``fringe'' theater, to stage a brief performance piece
involving four actors.
   It is the third musical produced at the 26-year-old National,
one of Britain's two flagship state-subsidized theaters. The first,
``Guys and Dolls,'' was a hit that went on to the commercial West
End.
   But the second, Marvin Hamlisch's ``Jean Seberg,'' directed by
Peter Hall, was a critical and financial flop.
   ``Sunday in the Park'' will run for 16 weeks, playing a full
eight performances a week. This is unusual for a repertory theater.
Its top ticket price of 20 pounds (about $33) is a record high for
the three-theater complex.
   It is the second of three Sondheim shows to be seen in London
this year. A commercial revival of ``A Little Night Music'' closed
Feb. 17 on the West End. ``Into the Woods,'' his most recent
Broadway show, opens Sept. 25 and will star Julia McKenzie.

<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   And now, for something completely different.
Frank Zappa, the rock star whose heart belongs to Dada, tonight
begins a three-day stint as guest host of a TV show _ on cable's
Financial News Network.
   His forum: FNN's ``Focus'' series. But the topics won't be the
state of rock, his 25 years of innovation and playful experiments
in music, or any kind of music at all. They are, however, in the
Zappa tradition: eclectic.
   Tonight's show concerns four opportunities for U.S. business in
the Soviet Union. He taped the segments during a trip five weeks
ago to Moscow, Paris and Czechoslovakia, where he met the country's
new president, Vaclav Havel.
   One segment, he says, details how Tass, the official Soviet news
agency, has begun an operation that could be a Soviet TV news
store, offering Western TV outlets its reports from the U.S.S.R.,
Eastern-bloc countries and elsewhere.
   ``They're trying to find Western consumers for the product of
their audio-visual department,'' Zappa says. And, he says,
``they'll shoot your story to order. Tell them what you want,
they'll shoot it.''
   Tuesday's show will be a chat with the owner of Manhattan's Le
Cirque, a restaurant where Robin Leach's kind of people dine. On
Wednesday, Zappa will interview former CBS newsman Daniel Schorr,
now a comentator on National Public Radio, about news as a business.
   Zappa, who once described himself as a
`composer-slash-businessman'' despite his rock roots and such gonzo
classics as ``Weasels Ripped My Flesh,'' concedes some may think it
weird he's appearing on FNN.
   ``I think part of the reason people think it's so odd is the
name of the venue,'' he says of FNN, which says it is seen in 33
million homes and offices. ``Financial News Network sounds pretty
gray and corporate.''
   He cheerfully admits high finance is not his bag: ``All I know
of the stock market is that it's all voodoo, and that the best
thing that's happened in this part of the 20th century is that
Drexel Burnham self-destructed.''
   But FNN, he says, is starting to offer programming in the
evening hours that aims at a broader audience than tunes in for its
daytime reports on Wall Street and world finance.
   He cites ``Focus,''whose host, Bob Berkowitz, is off on a book
tour, as such a broader-audience program. He says he first appeared
on it two months ago, talking about doing business with the Soviet
Union.
   Despite his recent non-musical expeditions, Zappa, 49, is still
busy with his music and says he's working on two new albums. He
also has overseen the transfer of his 50 other albums to compact
discs for release this year.
   And he has written his first television score, for ``Outrage at
Valdez,'' a Cousteau Society special on the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
Ted Turner's TBS cable network will show the program March 25.
   After Wednesday, Zappa plans to return home to North Hollywood,
Cal., and finish editing the tape he shot in Czechoslovakia, where
he has a cult following, during that nation's joyous process of
liberalization.
   The footage, he says, will be made into a one-hour show that
Great Britain's ITN network has bought for showing on London's
Channel Four in June, just before Czechoslovakia's presidential
elections.
   His show will be part of a six-hour extravaganza called ``An
Evening of Revolutionary Entertainment,'' he says.
   Like his music videos, Zappa's Prague program eventually will
wind up for sale, distributed by a Chicago company called MPI Inc.
His TV marketing company has a somewhat more interesting name.
   It's called Honker Home Video, he says, solemnly explaining:
``It's named after my nose.''

   HAVEL FETED: Vaclav Havel, the Czech
playwright-turned-president, will be saluted by New York's leading
artistic figures in a PBS special airing Thursday night. The

Brooklyn Philharmonic Orchestra.

   Ignatius Balistrieri, a city sanitation worker
for 31 years, remembers the days when Milwaukee's snow-covered
streets were plowed using horses and buggies.
   ``The men would stand in back and fan the sand mixture onto the
road,'' he says.
   But while snow falls the way it always has, the methods for
removing it have evolved into a high-tech multimillion-dollar
enterprise stretching across the northern United States.
   Cities in the Midwest, Northeast and mid-Atlantic each winter
spend millions of dollars keeping streets and walkways clean.
   Advancing technology has made the job easier. Improved snowplows
have reduced the number of workers needed to clear roads.
Hydraulic-powered plows on road salt trucks can be operated by one
person, for example, while the older plows required at least two
workers to maneuver.
   And road trucks sanding slippery roads now use salt-sand
mixtures and chemicals like liquid calcium chloride, which speed up
the melting process, in place of traditional sand.
   But the new technology also has made the task more expensive.
   Milwaukee spent $4 million to plow and salt 1,400 miles of road
in 1988, compared with $2 million in 1984, even though the city
received 13 more inches of snow in 1984 than 1988, Balistrieri said.
   Milwaukee averages about 49 inches of snowfall each winter, and
city officials always are prepared to clear at least that much.
   But erratic winters in Washington, D.C., which budgets about
$2.5 million annually for snow removal, have made it hard to
forecast what's needed, said Tara Hamilton of the Public Works
Department.
   ``After the 1987 winter, when we got 20 inches of snow in four
days, we pretty much made up our minds that we were going to be a
snow city and invest in the resources needed for that,'' she said.
   But since November, less than 13 inches has fallen, according to
the National Weather Service.
   ``It's hard to have a typical winter in Washington,'' Ms.
Hamilton said. Officials in Buffalo, N.Y., which averages 92 inches
a year, already have exceeded their budget for road salts this
year, but not because the city has gotten too much snow, said
street commissioner James Makowski.
   ``It's the minor snowfalls that kill us,'' Makowski said. ``We
get a quarter-inch and go out and salt, then get another
quarter-inch dropping a couple of hours later and have to go salt
again.''
   Buffalo, which budgets about $3.5 million a year for snow
removal, used 9,500 tons of salt from Thanksgiving to Dec. 19 in
1988 and 23,800 tons for the same period in 1989, he said.
   Minneapolis spent about $4 million plowing 1,057 miles of
streets last winter and has experimented this winter with new
equipment that can plow more area at a time, said street
maintenance engineer Bob Otto. Minnesota's average snowfall is 49
inches a year.
   Although homeowners don't spend millions on snow removal, they
too are looking for easier ways to clear their front doors,
driveways and sidewalks.
   Walk-behind or riding snowthrowers with a price range of $350 to
$1,700 are becoming household items, manufacturers say.
   Retailers ordered 543,000 snowthrowers in 1988, compared with
348,000 in 1984, said John Liskey of the Outdoor Power Equipment
Institute near Washington, D.C.
   ``Snowthrowers aren't seen as a luxury item anymore,'' said Chad
Kelly, marketing manager for The Toro Co. in Bloomington, Minn.
``We're seeing more planned purchases.''
   When Toro first manufactured snow removal equipment about 30
years ago, it sold only a gas-powered, walk-behind snowplow, Kelly
said.
   ``We've come a long way,'' he said, noting consumers can now
choose from dozens of models and sizes of snowthrowers that can
toss snow more than 35 feet. There also are rotating electrical
brooms and power shovels.
   Women and older people who might find conventional snow
shoveling too strenuous are being targeted as potential customers.
   ``It's a very competitive business and very volatile,'' Kelly
said. ``When it snows, people come out in droves to buy the product
and it can be very profitable. But when it doesn't snow, they're
hard to sell.''
   Most parts of the nation experienced a mild winter last year,
leaving retailers with large leftover inventories that should cut
demand for products this year by 10 percent, Liskey said.
   Kelly said he doesn't foresee any inventions in the near future
that will radically change snow removal, although improvements are
likely for many of the current products.
   ``I think products will continue to be made lighter and easier
to use,'' he said.
   But, he said, ``I don't see any laser technology that blasts the
snow off your driveway in three seconds.''

<HEAD>Once Again, That's 1-800-44-CHUNK ...</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Lurie keeps popping up in the strangest
places _ like right before that ad for ``The Clapper,'' or right
after the one for Zamfir, master of the pan flute.
   ``Hello, I'm John Lurie,'' he begins softly. ``And I want you to
know, now you can listen to the very strange and very beautiful
music of the Lounge Lizards here in America, just like people in
other lands.''
   And you can _ by dialing 1-800-44-CHUNK. The Lounge Lizards,
whose sound was once likened to ``a Holiday Inn band on acid,'' are
now available by dialing the same operators in Omaha, Neb., who
take orders for the latest from Slim Whitman, Boxcar Willie and
Richard Clayderman.
   So how does Lurie, a hipster
saxophonist-actor-songwriter-screenwriter and bandleader wind up
sharing late-night TV space with the Veg-O-Matic?
   ``I had to do it. I had no other choice,'' he explained recently
in his cluttered Manhattan apartment. ``What else am I going to do
with my life? What else? I could buy a condo, or I could put my
record out.''
   The record _ ``Voice of Chunk'' _ is available now, $11.99 for
cassette, $14.99 for compact disc. The ads began airing this month
in selected markets and nationally on VH-1. In one, Lurie appears
as a tall, thin, twisted version of the pitchman who once asked if
you remembered the Polovtsian Dance Theme Number Two.
   ``If you're like me, you like to receive things through the
mail. Maybe it's because it makes me feel less lonely,'' Lurie says
in another of the 30-second spots. ``Listen _ that's the new Lounge
Lizards record, `Voice of Chunk.' And now you can receive it
through the mail.''
   The ads approach but don't quite reach parody, which is what
Lurie had in mind when he decided last year to produce and market
the record himself. Fears that some people wouldn't get it were
heightened in the first days after the Feb. 1 air debut, the Lounge
Lizard said.
   ``There was a week, 10 days, of absolute terror. It was running
on TV, and it looked bad, and it wasn't selling,'' said Lurie,
holding a cigarette in one hand while rattling dice in the other.
``I was losing my mind.''
   Orders are now coming in every day, and Lurie is finding the
experience far more pleasurable than dealing with record company
weasels. The saxophonist, who formed the Lizards in 1979, has
nothing good to say about major labels: ``Obviously, the music I'm
doing is better than what they're putting out. It's just not as
saleable.''
   So he's selling it himself, which he has found provides a
certain instant gratification.
   ``You go down to the mailbox, and there's all these orders
there. It's not like the record company telling you, `Well, yes,
you sold 60 records today.' You go downstairs, and there's 50, 60
checks in the mail,'' he said. ``It's like the good old days when
the band used to get paid in cash.''
   While the ads are showing up in strange places, it's not unusual
for Lurie to do the same thing. His band was in Brazil last year to
headline a jazz festival; he was in Morocco to play St. James in
``The Last Temptation of Christ''; he's starred in a pair of
low-budget, critically hailed Jim Jarmusch films; he's planning a
Japanese tour with the Lizards this spring.
   The eight-piece band, while a relative nonentity in the United
States, is a sensation in Europe, Japan and South America. It once
bothered Lurie, but he now accepts his limited American audience as
a function of the U.S. music business.
   ``In France or in Germany, we're really the new geniuses of jazz
_ though I still don't know if it's jazz or not,'' he said. ``We're
hailed, and we play to 10,000 people in Japan. It's a whole
different deal.
   ``And then you come back to America and it's like the air is
taken out of your sails. ... The success of music (in the United
States) is really inversely proportional to its quality. I'm really
beginning to believe that.''
   Lurie risked a large chunk of change on the Lizards' fifth
album, and he's considered the possibilities either way: If the
album sells, or if the album stiffs.
   ``If it really works, I'll make so much money. I mean, I heard
Zamfir is a millionaire,'' he said. ``I read it in the Wall Street
Journal, so it must be true.''
   And if it doesn't?
   ``I'm really ruined. I'm going to be so broke. You're going to
be seeing me on a lot of TV shows.''

   The recycling industry, which quietly went
about its business for decades, suddenly has been thrust into the
spotlight as everyone scrambles to become ``recycle friendly.''
   One industry report estimates more than $2 billion will be spent
across the nation for recycling equipment over the next five years
to keep up with the enormous interest.
   Two years ago, the National Solid Wastes Management Association
featured only two recycling waste trucks at its annual convention.
At the most recent convention, there were 27 models.
   Supermarkets are collecting plastic grocery sacks for recycling.
Procter &amp; Gamble Co., a leading maker of consumer products, has
started introducing plastic and paper containers taking advantage
of recycled materials.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., a leading retailer, has begun tagging
shelves to inform shoppers about recycled materials and other
environmentally conscious products.
   ``I have been in this business a long time, and I have never
seen anything like what's going on today,'' said John Veidt, a
20-year veteran of the recycling business who runs the reclamation
division of Clayton, Mo.-based Jefferson Smurfit Corp.
   For a century, the recycling industry has pretty much operated
on its own, chugging along on a supply-meets-demand basis with
about 2,000 member companies of the National Association of
Recycling Industries.
   But the 1980s brought big changes, most notably the involvement
of government, which created unprecedented expansion opportunities.
   ``Generally, I think industry is recognizing that recycling is
just good business,'' said Richard Keller, a spokesman for the
National Recycling Coalition and chairman of the group's
subcommittee on market development.
   The government _ at every level _ has become a major player in
supplying raw materials that need to be recycled, mandating the use
of recycled products and buying the products.
   In the fall of 1986, 13 states had legislation favoring the use
of recycled products. Today, that number has grown to 34 with laws
affecting 17 out of every 20 Americans, the coalition says.
   One measure of the market's growth is the Official Recycled
Products Guide.
   The first edition, published by Robert Boulanger in April 1989,
listed 177 products made with recycled materials, mostly paper
products. In nine months, the number of listings has climbed to
1,500. Now, the New York-based guide includes building
construction, landscaping, rubber and plastic products.
   Keller remembers the days in the early '80s when he could do his
seminars on developing markets for recycled items ``in a phone
booth and have room left over.''
   ``Today, everybody is interested,'' he said.
   That interest has been good and bad. The paper side of the
business is oversupplied; the glass side is undersupplied.
   ``The dilemma we have ourselves in is that we have the
collection process geared up and hot, but it's going to be three
years before ... we are ready to start using the material,'' said
Veidt of Jefferson Smurfit, the nation's largest collector of waste
paper.
   Veidt said Jefferson Smurfit, which also makes paper, cardboard
and plastic containers, is among those papermakers looking to
expand. The company wants to build a new plant devoted completely
to recycling newsprint, he said.
   Jefferson Smurfit also recently announced a joint venture with
Waste Management of North America to collect waste paper that will
boost the company's collection to more than 4 million tons a year,
more than three times its nearest competitor.
   Many other large paper companies in the United States and Canada
plan to build mills closer to cities, or ``urban forests,'' to
exploit the abundance of waste paper.
   The supply glut has dropped prices for a ton of used newspapers
to all-time lows, and tons of the stuff are sitting in warehouses.
In some parts of the country, people have to pay to drop off their
newspapers, Veidt said.
   The glass industry faces the opposite problem. Glass makers
would like to increase the percentage of waste glass used in the
manufacture of new containers, but supplies are tight.
   Interest in waste glass recently was heightened by the success
of an Anchor Glass plant in Connellsville, Pa., which ran on
nothing but used glass for seven weeks, said Chas Miller, a
spokesman for the Glass Packaging Institute in Washington.
   ``I loved to be able to run all our plants using 60 percent of
cullet (used glass) but we can't get the supply,'' said Austin
Fiore, regional manager of recycling and public affairs for
Owens-Brockway Glass Containers Inc., a division of Owens-Illinois
Inc.
   Fiore, who is based in Philadephia, said the company's 24 plants
around the country are capable of using 85 percent used glass, but
can find only enough clear glass to use between 22 percent and 45
percent.
   Experts differ on how profitable the recycling business will be.
While government interest has been intense, growth may depend on
private investment. ``Companies know that recycling is the wave of
the future and they are all trying to get in a position to do it,''
said Vishnu Swarup, a stock analyst for Prudential Bache Securities
in New York. ``Right now, they're sharing the profits and losses
with the community, but some day they'll tell the community we
can't keep doing this.''
   That may come by the mid-1990s, he said.
   Publisher Boulanger summed it up this way: ``The technology is
there to do it. There's public awareness. The government's ready.
The only thing that hasn't been ironed out is the economic side _
who's going to pay for it.''

<HEAD>GOP Seeks To Gain Enough Senate Strenth To Bid for Control in 1992</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Off-year elections usually are lean years for
the party that holds the White House, but Republicans think they
can break the pattern in 1990 and gain enough Senate strength to
bid for renewed control in 1992.
   To do it, they'll have to add at least one or two to their
current 45-seat minority, reversing the odds that confront a
president's party with the liklihood of losses in the congressional
elections between presidential campaigns.
   That and House redistricting make the Nov. 6 elections crucial
in shaping congressional politics for the rest of the century. The
36 governors and the legislatures being chosen this year will
control the redrawing of congressional districts based on the 1990
cenus. ``The political jackpot is going to be who gets to draw the
lines come 1991,'' Vice President Dan Quayle says.
   It all comes together in 1992 when President Bush presumably
will be seeking a second term, the new House districts will be in
effect for the first time and Senate control could be within the
reach of Republican challengers.
   The House is too Democratic, and incumbents too strong, for
there to be any near-term prospect of a change in the control the
Democrats have held for 34 years. They now have 85 seats more than
the Republicans, and the president's party has not gained House
seats in a midterm election since 1934.
   ``If 1992 is a good year for Republicans and we do well in 1990,
then we stand to gain immeasurably in political terms,'' Quayle
said in a recent interview. ``So this is a year to really establish
the foundation.''
   That won't be done easily. Republicans have 18 Senate seats at
risk this year, Democrats 16. Only three incumbents have announced
they are retiring, and all are Republicans. But the GOP is almost
certain to hold one of those seats, in New Hampshire, and is in
good position to recapture the others, in Idaho and Colorado.
   Overall, Quayle says the Republicans ``have a better crop of
challengers this time, on a comparative basis, than we've ever
had.'' That includes a half-dozen House members risking those seats
to run against Democratic senators. The Democrats, on the other
hand, have seen some of their most promising challengers step aside
for 1990.
   In two states where Republican senators would have been heavy
favorites anyhow, they may not have a thing to worry about.
   Virginia Democrats have not found a candidate to oppose Sen.
John W. Warner, who says he would ``accept that decision with
humility'' and campaign anyhow.
   Nor is there significant opposition so far to Republican Sen.
Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, 87 and seeking a seventh term in
the Senate he entered as a Democrat. He switched parties in 1964.
   Democratic Sen. David Pryor of Arkansas has no announced
opponents, either, in his bid for a virtually certain third term.
   Campaigns like those are typical, with incumbents strong and
challengers facing long odds. Some will tighten toward upsets; most
will run to form.
   The 1990 Senate battlegrounds will include Iowa, Illinois,
Michigan and Rhode Island, with Democratic incumbents, and Kentucky
and South Dakota, where Republican senators seek new terms. Sen.
Dan Coats of Indiana, appointed to succeed Quayle, is running in
his first statewide election, challenged by a Democratic state
representative. That's a long shot for the Democrats, but it will
be a target. They would delight in capturing the vice president's
old Senate seat as they won the seat he and Coats once held in the
House.
   The battle for the Senate itself likely will wait at least two
years. With the Democrats up 55 to 45, it would take Republicans an
improbable five-seat off-year gain to get to the tie the vice
president's vote would make into a GOP majority. But the erosion of
Republican Senate strength over the past three elections is,
ironically, one basis for GOP optimism this time. Off-year swings
against the White House party usually occur because of the
vulnerability of first-term members elected on the coattails of the
winning presidential candidate. The major impact is in the House,
with two-year terms, rather than the Senate, with six.
   But Democrats have not sustained a net loss of Senate seats in
any election since 1980, when the Republicans gained a dozen and
captured the control they held for the next six years.
   Twenty seats now held by Democratic senators will be up for
election in 1992, while Republicans will have to defend 14. Bush's
name atop the ticket should help GOP Senate candidates, although he
showed no coattail strength in the 1988 elections.
   Then again, the voters may prefer the lineup of power the way it
stands now. An NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll conducted last
month found 63 percent of those surveyed think it is better to have
different parties controlling Congress and the White House, and
only 24 percent want both branches in the same political hands.

   As Alice said in Wonderland: ``It gets curiouser
and curiouser.'' In another context, Future Shock is already here.
That's what the news is like these days, foes become friends,
dictatorships become democracies, and the old shock of recognition
is gone. In the following, a veteran AP newsman tells of his
efforts to keep up with events.

<TEXT>
   I'm having trouble absorbing the news these days.
   History now seems to march in exclamation marks. Irony abounds,
the time machine looks warped, credulity is stretched and you can't
tell the players WITH a score card.
   The Cold War ends in a strange admixture, reviving both the
fears of World War II about a triumphant Germany and the hopes of
World War I about a world made safe for democracy.
   Now a wildly cheering Congress greets the president of the new
and independent Czechoslovakia, who was in prison four months ago.
It was an American president, Woodrow Wilson, who created
Czechoslovakia in the first place, before it was swallowed by
Hitler and shackled by Stalin.
   And here is Vaclav Havel, out from the Soviet shadow, telling
the government of the United States that the best way it could help
his country and the world was to help the Soviet Union on the
``immensely complicated road to democracy.''
   In this way, says the man from a recent slave state, the Cold
War can be replaced by ``an era in which all of us, large and
small, former slaves and former masters _ will be able to create
what your great President Lincoln called the family of man.''
   This is but the latest in a racing river of change.
   In the first joyous rush west after the Berlin Wall came down,
it seemed unseemly to recall that the last time there was a unified
Germany it tore the world apart. In the 45 years since Hitler was
smashed, Western and Eastern Europe mostly worried about each
other. Now both seem to be on tiptoe looking for a polite way to
get a guarantee of peace from the merging Germanys.
   Said an East German official: ``Our friendly neighbors should
understand the desire of Germans for reunification.'' Said Foreign
Minister Roland Dumas of France: ``Germans should also understand
the worries of their friendly neighbors.''
   For most of the Cold War years, the vocabulary of the Kremlin
seemed to be limited to one word, nyet. Now suddenly we find the
Moscow leadership agreeing on a Thursday to what it positively
opposed on Wednesday. There are days when dour Bolsheviks sound
like friendly Rotarians.
   The two superpowers, whose mutual enmity kept the world nervous
for four decades, now seem like one and a half superpowers, maybe
less. The Soviets appear to be shrinking in a sea of troubles and,
after Panama, Uncle Sam looks less than a giant astride the planet.
   Germany appears to dominate the thoughts of the old world. Drugs
command the attention of the new.
   In Washington, the mayor of the capital of the United States is
indicted for possessing cocaine and lying about his drug
connections. On the same day, in Colombia, the president of the
United States seeks ways to stop cocaine smuggling from South
America.
   In Miami, a sullen little man with an utterly resistible
personality awaits trial on charges of cocaine trafficking. Getting
him to trial took 12,000 U.S. soldiers, scores of planes and ships
and the lives of 23 Americans and several hundred Panamanians. The
world was also treated to the picture of American fighting men
trying to flush out their quarry with thunderous rock music.
   In Colombia, four presidents agree on the need to find other
crops for Andean farmers to grow instead of coca, from which
cocaine derives. President Bush promises to try to expand U.S.
markets for coffee and cut flowers.
   Will the next Marshall Plan be designed to stop coca not
communism, dope peddlers not agents of Karl Marx? Or will the next
Cold War be fought with midget mercenaries dropped from the air? In
an accelerated secret program, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
was reported studying the killing power of malumbia, an inch-long
white moth which, in its caterpillar stage, adores dining on the
green leaves of coca plants.
   The cocaine summit was guarded by warships, frogmen, high-speed
patrol boats, swarms of helicopters, at least one submarine and
5,000 security agents on land. All were there to protect the
commander in chief of the United States and his confreres against
the gangsters of Colombia who, we are told, now hone their public
image with the aid of public relations consultants.
   In other areas rife with strife, Nelson Mandela of South Africa
said that toward the end of his 27 years in prison his jailers let
him see old Don Ameche movies; a New York judge ruled that to deny
a beggar the chance to beg is to deny him his right of free speech;
Ivana Trump said $25 million was nowhere near enough for a divorce;
Soviet officials toured the Kennedy Space Center while NASA readied
a secret shuttle to spy on their homeland; and tiny Albania, said
to be the poorest nation in Europe and one of the most suspicious _
it has no diplomatic relations with the United States or most of
the world _ Albania let it be known it would welcome foreign
investments but not let foreigners own anything!

<HEAD>Quiet Northern Irish Town Rebuilds from Yet Another Bomb</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto
   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The bombs go off and the news tells of the death
toll, the damage and who was responsible _ another episode soon to
be lost in all the other tragedy of 20 years of violence in
Northern Ireland. But while others forget, the scars remain with
the people who were bombed, the survivors of the dead, the maimed.
Warrenpoint in Northern Ireland is an example of what ``the
troubles'' have wrought.

<TEXT>
   The roof is back on Charlie
Wills' gas station, Pat Rice is back in his house, and it takes a
second look to see the scars that an IRA bomb left on Mariann
Cooper's face.
   The scars on the town, though, are still raw: a hole next to the
police barracks on Charlotte St. where a hardware store and Mrs.
Cooper's home once stood; the ``For Sale'' signs on two boarded-up
houses; the flowers outside the police station for Joanne Reilly,
killed in her 20th year.
   Warrenpoint, about 40 miles south of Belfast and just across the
border from the Irish Republic, has been through this before. But
it has become a microcosm of the personal tragedy faced by people
and towns in Northern Ireland's 20 years of fighting between the
forces loyal to Britain and the partisans of Irish unity.
   The news reports and broadcasts tell of the death and
destruction; time passes, and then the people are alone in their
mourning and loss.
   More than 2,700 people had been killed before Joanne Reilly was
killed in Warrenpoint last April 12. While Warrenpoint has tried to
rebuild, 47 more have died in Northern Ireland.
   The British government last year paid out 11.6 million pounds,
the equivalent of $19.7 million at current exchange rates, in
compensation for personal injuries caused by the conflict, and 20.6
million pounds ($35 million) for property damage, according to the
Northern Ireland Office.
   Mariann Cooper had been about 50 feet away from a bomb big
enough to damage houses a mile away. She is now deaf in her left
ear, has only partial sight in her left eye and faces more plastic
surgery on her face.
   That explosion at 10 minutes to 10 on a Wednesday morning is
like a videotape running and re-running in her head.
   ``That's the only way I can explain it,'' she said.
   She keeps a big folder of newspaper clippings about the
disaster, and insists she wants to forget.
   ``Having said forget, I'd like people to remember it happened.
Why it happened. It happened for no reason.''
   Mrs. Cooper is a Roman Catholic; her husband, Stuart, is a
Protestant living through a conflict that has pitted Catholic
against Protestant.
   ``It doesn't make a difference in Warrenpoint,'' Cooper said.
   The bomb that disrupted their lives was packed into a stolen
Toyota van that was driven into a yard behind the Heatley and
Morgan hardware store _ next to the police barracks.
   Miss Reilly, working in the back of the store, was killed
instantly; at least two dozen people were injured badly enough to
require hospital treatment, and 32 families were put out of their
homes. The Daisy Hill hospital was already receiving the wounded
when the Irish Republican Army gave its first telephone warning.
   The IRA later said the bomb exploded prematurely and offered
``sincerest apologies'' to the bereaved and the injured.
   ``Even if we had two hours' notice and cleared the entire town
of Warrenpoint ... you still would have had 364 premises damaged,''
said Jim McCart, a member of the county council.
   That's one of every six homes in Warrenpoint, a town of 5,600
people, 85 percent of whom, including the dead woman, are
Catholics. It's a stronghold of support for the Social Democratic
and Labor Party, which rejects violence but shares the IRA's goal
of a united Ireland.
   The bomb did little damage to the police barracks, which is
surrounded by high walls and barbed wire and is protected from
mortars and missiles by a steel roof.
   Charlotte St. ``was a happy enough street, everybody got along
with everybody,'' said Rice, who had spent a decade renovating his
house across the street from the police station.
   Warrenpoint had been hit before: the Crown Hotel was bombed and
is just a vacant lot; the Ulster Bar and the post office were
rebuilt after bombings; the ``Seven Steps'' hotel along the shore
of Carlingford Lough is still charred and gaping.
   An IRA bomb outside town, near the ruins of Narrow Water Castle,
killed 18 British soldiers Aug. 27, 1979 _ the same day another IRA
bomb killed Earl Mountbatten of Burma, a cousin of Queen Elizabeth
II.
   After the latest attack, ``people supported each other a lot,''
said Richard Black of the social services office in nearby Newry.
   ``There was a great groundswell of opinion in Warrenpoint that
they were quite determined to get on with life, and live as
normally as possible, and that did gel a lot of the families
together.''
   The flip side of determination, though, is resignation.

   ``We've learned to live with it,'' Black said. ``I think people
have become very weary as well. There seems to be no light at the
end of the tunnel.''
   Among the flowers that still cover Joanne Reilly's hilltop grave
in St. Peter's Cemetery are two small potted pines, one with a tiny
Santa Claus, and a big display saying ``Happy Birthday, Sis.''
   Before her 21st birthday Sept. 24, relatives and friends filled
three columns of the Newry Reporter newspaper with memorials.
   Beneath a picture of a lively, smiling, dark-haired young woman
were poems from her parents Ann and Paul, her brothers Paul and
Martin, her pal Michelle, her boyfriend Sean, her aunts and uncles
and cousins. Paul Reilly's message said: ``My heart still aches, I
whisper low, God bless you Sis, I love you so.''
   The hardware store and the Coopers' house will not be rebuilt.
One other house may be demolished. Joanne Reilly's grandmother is
among those who have not moved back to Charlotte St.
   Just after the bombing, Geraldine McShane advertised a ``Bomb
Damage Sale'' at the Pick 'n' Mix shop on Charlotte St. In the
summer, she had a going out of business sale.
   ``Well, I would say the bomb was 50 percent responsible,'' she
said. ``No one was coming down that side at all after the bomb.''
   The government compensated her for the soft toys that couldn't
be sold because they were full of splintered glass.
   The bomb blew the roof off Wills' gas station, and caused him
two months of anxiety for himself and his three employees _ three
important jobs in a town where unemployment is estimated to
approach 25 percent.
   ``It's just like it was, maybe better, it is indeed,'' he said.
``We just renovated the place while we're at it. It's not like I
wanted, but we'll get there.''
   ``Aunty Chris'' Caulfield is still selling cigarettes and candy
in her chilly shop across the street but complained, ``business is
terrible.''
   Charlie Burns had insisted that no bomb would dislodge him from
his barber shop, where he was born 85 years ago, but then a long
illness changed his mind.
   ``Oh, I hated to sell it. I loved being on the square, because
no one could build in front of you,'' said Burns.
   His father and his grandfather had worked in the shop, which had
one parlor for businessmen and another for grimy longshoremen and
other laborers. A basin and cabinets from Burns' shop are now part
of the remodeled decor at Bennett's pub, where Burns is a valued
regular.
   Stuart Cooper, said his family salvaged one sweater and the cat
from the ruins of their 118-year-old house. Moving increased their
mortgage from 40,000 pounds (about $68,000) to 65,000 pounds (about
$110,000).
   No one close to Mariann Cooper had ever been hurt in the
troubles, but she wasn't surprised when her turn came.
   ``I always felt that it had gone on for so long, something was
bound to happen,'' she said. ``It can't pass by your door for 20
years.''

<DATELINE>CORNETU, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Constantin Surescu, a 70-year-old
farmer, stood in the wreckage of the house, fingering pieces of
brick and the yellow balustrade that Nicolae Ceausescu's police had
ordered him to destroy.
   What he couldn't destroy himself, a bulldozer finished off all
but a single room, but even then Surescu wouldn't leave. For
months, he, his wife, and others huddled in the candle-lit room
that had been spared, surviving the freezing winter with only a
small charcoal stove.
   Ceausescu had destroyed their lives and their village as part of
his plan to move Romania's rural population into big, concentrated
towns.
   When Ceausescu was overthrown Dec. 22, and executed with his
wife three days later, Surescu's family laughed and cried for joy.
   But the nightmare for Surescu and dozens of neighbors in the
village of Cornetu, 13 miles west of Bucharest, didn't end.
   ``It would have been better if God had taken me,'' Surescu said,
clutching a color photograph of the large, well-kept beige house
with relief designs he moved into in 1961.
   ``I don't believe it will ever be the same.''
   He continues to live in the room that remains.
   He said he had developed heart disease because of the trauma.
   The once leafy outskirts of Cornetu, with neat houses,
well-tended gardens, and grapevines climbing the walls, exist no
more.
   ``Not even if we had a war would it look like this,'' said a
neighbor, Gheorghe Cristea, a 63-year-old bewhiskered farmer,
shaking his head in disbelief.
   Both sides of the muddy road heading west out of Cornetu are
lined with the skeletons of a war Ceausescu tried to hide _ one
against the rural population. Many homes are just shells, some are
missing roofs, others have holes in walls. Very few escaped
relatively unscathed.
   Surescu and his 65 neighbors on the outskirts of town were
luckier than the 350 families living in the center of Cornetu whose
homes were destroyed first.
   Romania's revolution saved the homes on the periphery from final
destruction. The debris was to have been buried in huge pits
already dug in gardens where flowers and vegetables once grew.
   The center of Cornetu gives no hint that 350 houses once stood
there. The houses were buried, and their grave is now covered with
rows of four-story apartment buildings, Ceausescu's response to the
possibility of too much rural independence.
   Some of the buildings destroyed were hovels, and the tenements
are improvements, even though they are shoddily built structures
that do not take into account rural lifestyles.
   But the perception is widespread that Ceausescu had motives
other than improving the quality of life for peasants.
   Virgil Ioanid, vice president of the National Commission for
Urban and Regional Planning, said Ceausescu was apparently afraid
he could not control small villages.
   In the small villages, he added, local police were on good terms
with the people, which angered Ceausescu who felt he couldn't keep
tabs on what was happening.
   With larger towns of 5,000 people or more, Ceausescu could bring
in his fiercely loyal and hated Securitate secret police ``and
control was easier,'' he added.
   Ceausescu wanted to concentrate 10 million rural residents in
2,500 to 3,000 agro-industrial centers, said Commission President
Serban Popescu-Criveanu.
   Ceauescu intended to destroy 8,000 to 8,500 of Romania's 11,000
rural villages, Popescu-Criveanu said.
   ``Fortunately, he didn't have time to carry out his entire plan.
... But about 2,000 small houses were destroyed near Bucharest.''
   About 30 villages were affected, and eight were razed, he said.
   Popescu-Criveanu added that one of the new government's first
commitments was to replace the destroyed homes as quickly as
possible. He said about 500 families didn't want to return, but the
homes of the other 1,500 would be rebuilt.
   Constantin Surescu recalled the day last May when the bulldozer,
the police and town officials arrived.
   ``They ordered us to destroy our own houses,'' he said.
   ``Many people said, `I don't want to do this.' If you said `No,'
they came in the night and got you and beat you up.''
   First, electric power was disrupted, and that frightened some
residents enough to start dismantling their homes with whatever
implements they had at hand, Sorescu said.
   But others like Surescu and his neighbor Cristea resisted,
arguing with officials at town hall and scurrying into the fields
when authorities came to their homes.
   Cristea said they had heard on Western radio broadcasts that
political change was sweeping Eastern Europe, and they expected
something to happen in Romania, so they tried to delay the
bulldozers as long as possible.
   All residents whose homes were destroyed were given apartments
in pre-fabricated concrete buildings. But in Cornetu's outskirts,
more than half the residents refused to leave their homes, begging
the wreckers to leave one room intact.
   ``Even when they were destroying what I couldn't destroy, I
didn't want to leave,'' Surescu said.
   ``They gave me an apartment but I didn't want to stay. ... I
felt like I was in a hospital. It was cold. There was water on the
walls. It was like being in a grave.''
   Now he was picking at the pieces of brick, gently fingering what
was left of the home he had loved.
   ``I'm not leaving from here,'' he said.

<HEAD>Trump Says Publicity on Marriage Troubles Has Helped Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tycoon Donald Trump, who usually delights in
media attention, says he hates the splashy publicity about his
breakup with wife Ivana but believes it has a silver lining: it's
good for business.
   In an interview Thursday, Trump said the screaming tabloid
headlines and talk-show jokes about his marital travails actually
have benefitted his multibillion-dollar casino, hotel and airline
empire.
   ``The business has never been better,'' he said, ``but because
it's a private company most people don't know about it.
Unfortunately, for all the wrong reasons, the last two weeks it's
been even better yet.''
   Trump said business has been up at his two hotel-casinos in
Atlantic City, N.J., the Plaza Hotel and the Trump Shuttle, which
links New York with Washington and Boston, since the breakup first
hit the headlines two weeks ago.
   Still, he said having his name splashed over the media has taken
a toll.
   ``It's horrible. I hate it. I hate the publicity,'' Trump said
in his glitzy 26th-floor office commanding a view of Central Park
and the Plaza Hotel, one of his properties.
   ``It's been on a personal basis difficult because I happen to
like Ivana. ... But it's something you have to go through and in
many cases a lot of people have to go through it. People grow
apart.''
   Wearing a bright red-and-blue striped tie and navy blue suit,
Trump looked tired as he dealt with the normal everyday hassles of
a billionaire mogul. His associates bustled in and out of his
office throughout the interview.
   He said the potential loss of Ivana, his business partner and
the manager of the opulent Plaza in Manhattan, wouldn't create a
void in his organization or have a negative impact over the long
term.
   ``That's one of the reasons you sign a pre-nuptial agreement,''
Trump said. ``If something should happen, you know what you have to
pay out, and that's one of the reasons that when you're in business
it's very important to have a pre-nuptial agreement signed.''
   Under an agreement Ivana is contesting, she would receive $25
million and the couple's home in Connecticut as well as custody of
their children. Trump's holdings are estimated to be worth up to $4
billion.
   Although Trump insisted the publicity was a business plus, some
marketing analysts said the headlines could hurt an empire built
the developer's name.
   ``He's becoming a joke,'' said Jack Trout, president of Trout &amp;
Ries, a marketing consulting firm in Greenwich, Conn. ``For a
serious brand, that can be a big problem,'' he said, suggesting
that the publicity could have a negative impact on the Trump
trademark.
   Mrs. Trump declined through spokesman John Scanlon to comment on
her husband's remarks.
   ``All Mrs. Trump wants is a fair and equitable share of the
fortune that they accumulated together while they were married,''
Scanlon said. ``We're disappointed that Mr. Trump is prepared to
offer his wife and children less than 1 percent of his accumulated
wealth. We really expected better of him.''
   In his best-selling book ``The Art of the Deal,'' Trump called
Ivana ``incredibly good at anything she's ever done, a natural
manager,'' and credited her for the strong performance of his Trump
Castle hotel-casino in Atlantic City, which she used to manage.
   Al Glasgow, publisher of the monthly newsletter Atlantic City
Action, said revenues have been up strongly in recent months at
both Trump Plaza and Trump Castle, the two leading casinos in the
gaming town, followed by Holiday Corp.'s Harrah's.
   But the growth in the Trump casinos has been due to their new
managers and their quality of service, Glasgow said, rather than
any publicity about the Trump's personal vicissitudes.
   ``I don't think it's had any impact at all,'' he said in a
telephone interview. ``Donald's marriage breakup is making
headlines now, but they'll soon be forgotten in April when the Taj
Mahal opens.''
   That third Trump casino in Atlantic City is due to open on April
2.
   Bruce Nobles, president of Trump Shuttle, said passenger traffic
on the hourly flights jumped 7 percent last week from the previous
week.
   ``I'm not going to tell you that the publicity didn't help,'' he
said. ``It certainly could have.''
   Pan Am Corp., which operates a rival shuttle service, saw its
traffic increase 8 percent, spokeswoman Elizabeth Manners said. She
attributed the rise to heavy traveling before the Presidents Day
holiday.

<HEAD>Greyhound Says It'll Operate Despite Drivers' Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greyhound bus drivers say they'll walk off the job
when their contract expires March 1, but the company already has
begun hiring replacements and says it will operate a full schedule
by the end of next month.
   The Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions, which
represents 6,300 drivers and 3,075 office and maintenance workers,
notified the company Thursday of its decision to go on strike at
12:01 a.m. March 2, Greyhound Lines Inc. spokesman George Gravley
said.
   No talks in the dispute are scheduled, Gravley said. Union
officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
   The two sides met together in Phoenix last Friday and Monday and
then held separate meetings with a federal mediator Tuesday, but no
agreement could be reached, Gravley said.
   The company and union remain far apart, with Greyhound offering
a three-year deal worth about $63 million. Gravely said the union
initially had sought a pact valued at $561 million, but reduced
that to $475 million.
   Union membership previously had approved a strike, and Greyhound
responded by advertising for permanent replacements. ``We have 600
people in school ... and are still taking applications,'' Gravley
said.
   ``We will ... operate as many schedules as possible on March 2,
based on the number of employees who stay on the job and the number
of replacements available to us,'' Greyhound Chairman Fred G.
Currey said. ``We will build back the service as additional workers
become available and as routes are subcontracted.
   ``We expect to be serving all points on our system before the
end of March.''
   Greyhound says its drivers earn top pay in the industry,
``except for one or two small ones in the Northeast.'' It said its
offer would boost the average of its 1,500 highest paid drivers
from $33,218 last year to $40,725 by 1990.
   Overall, Greyhound says its drivers made an average salary of
$24,643 last year.
   ``It is an excellent offer from a company that lost $20 million
over the last three years and it is all this company can afford,''
Currey said.
   ``The union has not disputed the fact that we cannot afford to
pay more than we have offered,'' he said. ``Instead, union leaders
have told us repeatedly that an employer's ability to pay is
`irrelevant.'''
   Greyhound said it rejected union suggestions that fares be
raised 10 percent to cover the increased cost of their proposal.
   Currey led the investment group that paid Phoenix-based
Greyhound Corp. $350 million for its bus system in March 1987 and
then bought Dallas-based Trailways Lines Inc., the nation's largest
Trailways system, four months later for $80 million.
   The company lost $2.6 million in 1987 and $17.4 million in 1988,
and expects to report a small profit for 1989 of about $730,000 on
revenues of approximately $1 billion.
   Greyhound says its 3,949 buses serve 9,500 locations, and are
the only public transportation available in about 9,000 of those
areas.

<HEAD>UAL's Wolf Says He's Eager To Hear Worker Buyout Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf is still encouraging
United Airlines employees to develop a buyout proposal even though
the workers may not retain him as head of the parent company.
   ``The entire board stands ready to receive a fair and financed
offer from the employee groups and will give any such offer prompt
consideration,'' Wolf said Thursday in a brief statement after a
UAL board meeting.
   Nevertheless, the carrier cautioned in a statement that ``there
can be no assurance that any acquisition proposal will be made by
the employee groups or any other party or that, if made, the board
will determine that such proposal is in the best interest of UAL
shareholders.''
   UAL stock dropped sharply, apparently indicating investor fears
that hopes for a buyout are receding. The stock fell $5.75 in New
York Stock Exchange trading Thursday, closing at $126.50.
   At the meeting, UAL directors authorized the release of
confidential financial information to the three United Airlines
labor unions that are leading the drive for employee control of the
nation's second-largest airline.
   It was revealed last week that the union group _ representing
United's pilots, machinists and flight attendants _ has been
looking for a possible replacement for Wolf, who initially gave
strong support to an employee buyout proposa.
   The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Wolf had
turned against the buyout plan and threatened to take other top
managers with him if he is forced out as chairman. The newspaper
cited unidentified sources familiar with the company.
   Airline analysts have said that dumping Wolf, who has taken a
hard line in labor negotiations, would weaken United's ability to
win back market share from industry leader American Airlines.
   United's unions last month proposed an employee purchase of 75
percent of UAL's stock. In a rare show of unity, the workers
offered to negotiate as a group on a five-year labor package,
including wage concessions, to anchor the buyout.
   At a Jan. 26 meeting, UAL's board encouraged the unions to
develop a formal buyout proposal, including a plan for financing
the stock purchase.
   Investors and analysts have been skeptical about the workers'
ability to borrow enough money for a buyout, though.
   In October, an attempted $300-a-share buyout led by Wolf and the
pilots flopped after the machinists opposed the plan, causing
lenders to balk. The collapse of the proposed $6.75 billion deal
helped trigger a 190-point collapse in the Dow Jones industrial
average.
   Conditions for leveraged buyouts have deteriorated since then
with the collapse of the junk bond market, a key source of takeover
financing.
   UAL is under pressure from its largest shareholder, Coniston
Partners, to take action to increase the value of its shares, which
have tumbled from $294 in September to a recent low of $121.

<HEAD>FDA Approves Monsanto Fat Substitute For Use In Frozen Desserts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It's cold, wet and creamy, and sweet on the
tongue. It's thicker than top superpremium ice cream brands, and
just a little bit harder to scrape with your spoon.
   It doesn't taste exactly like Haagen-Dasz or Ben &amp; Jerry's, but
what do you expect for a product with half the calories and
one-fifteenth the fat?
   NutraSweet Co., the maker of NutraSweet low-cal sweetener, is
hoping for a mouthful with Simple Pleasures, a superpremium ice
cream substitute with no fat and low cholesterol.
   Its secret lies in Simplesse, a product made from egg whites and
milk protein that has no cholesterol and no fat. Simplesse
eventually may be used as a substitute for other dairy products
like yogurt, sour cream, butter, margarine and cheese.
   Simple Pleasures was unveiled for reporters Thursday after
becoming the first fat-substitute product to win approval from the
Food and Drug Administration.
   The real taste test will come this summer when it shows up in
seven flavors in supermarkets across the country. Distribution in
Europe is expected by the end of the year, said Simplesse general
manager David L. Morley.
   ``It's potentially very significant. This is the first non-fat
fat, so to speak, to be approved on the market,'' said Harvey
Stober, a chemical analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., who said
sales could grow to $500 million or $1 billion a year in several
years.
   Monsanto stock jumped higher following the FDA approval,
finishing $4.37{ higher at $112.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Simplesse is aimed at customers who want to cut the amount of
fat and cholesterol in their diet while satisfying their taste
buds. It will be launched in an age of dieting and health
consciousness, when customers have lined their shelves with
products such as oat bran and spring water.
   Simplesse cannot be used in frying or baking, however, because
it congeals at higher temperatures. And the company has yet to come
up with a vanilla flavor Simple Pleasures that meets its
expectations.
   ``Potentially it could help somebody lower their fat intake. But
if you're not careful it might have undesirable effects on the
diet,'' said Lisa Lefferts, a staff scientist at the Center for
Science in the Public Interest, a Washington watchdog group.
   ``We don't know whether they'll substitute it for fat, or people
will just eat more double-scoop ice cream cones.''
   But Robert Shapiro, NutraSweet's chairman and chief executive,
said Simple Pleasures could resolve the conflict between eating
healthy foods and indulging in what tastes good. Americans reduced
the fat in their diets by 3 percent from 1982 to 1988 but still ate
an average 5 gallons of ice cream last year, according to
NutraSweet.
   ``Simplesse is in our view nothing less than a historical
breakthrough in food technology, in the never-ending conflict
between health and indulgence,'' Shapiro said. ``Simplesse means we
can now enjoy all the rich, creamy taste of foods ... without the
fat, without the calories, without the worry and without the
guilt.''
   A 4-ounce serving of strawberry flavor has 120 calories and less
than 1 gram of fat, compared to 250 calories and 15 grams for
superpremium ice cream. Morley said Simple Pleasures uses sugar,
not NutraSweet, although the sugar and fat substitutes could be
used together.
   FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit in Washington said NutraSweet would
have to seek separate federal approval for other products
containing Simplesse, such as mayonnaise, salad dressing, sour
cream or frozen yogurt.
   Nevertheless, NutraSweet already has agreed to supply Simplesse
to Kraft-General Foods Inc. for its mayonnaise and Miracle Whip
salad dressing.
   Just as diet soda and other low-calorie products bear the
NutraSweet logo, Simple Pleasures and other Simplesse-containing
products will bear a special logo, a red and white circle and
rectangle imprinted with a blue ``Simplesse.''
   All new products will be made and marketed by Simplesse Co., a
new division of NutraSweet.
   Two other companies have petitions pending for fat substitutes.
Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble is seeking permission for
Olestra, a synthetic product make of sugar and oils that would be
used in shortenings, oils and snacks like potato chips, said
spokesman Don Tassone. The petition, submitted in April 1987,
remains pending.
   Kraft, of Glenview, Ill., is seeking permission to use a fat
substitute in frozen esserts. Kraft spokeswoman Kathy Knuth said
the petition is pending and could be approved later this year.

<HEAD>Bank of New England Reports $1.11 Billion Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of New England Corp., which went from profits
to steep losses late last year, is reviewing whether it should have
made bigger provisions against bad loans earlier in 1989.
   ``I really feel that as we went through 1989, we weren't dealing
with a full deck,'' said James Moynihan, senior vice president at
Advest Inc. in Boston.
   Bank of New England reported Thursday its 1989 losses were worse
than expected at $1.11 billion. The company also said it was
reviewing how its quarterly loan-loss provisions were allocated,
indicating the possibility that it should have taken bigger
provisions earlier in the year when the bank was still reporting
profits.
   ``I don't think that we could have a loss like that and not say
there were mistakes and misjudgments,'' said Marcia Ryan, a bank
spokeswoman.
   Analysts said the review of loan-loss provisions indicates the
bank might have misstated its financial condition in previous
quarters, which could open the bank to more lawsuits. The bank
already faces several lawsuits from shareholders who claim they
were misled by the bank.
   Bank of New England, which has had to boost its reserves against
bad real estate loans, estimated earlier this year its l989 losses
would be $1.05 billion because it was boosting its reserves against
credit losses to $1.65 billion.
   Other banks also have suffered financial ills because of the
region's slumping real estate market, but analysts say Bank of New
England has received some of the deepest wounds because it was an
aggressive lender during a construction boom in the mid-1980s.
   Yet Bank of New England's serious troubles did not become
apparent until late last year. For the first three quarters of
1989, the bank said it had earned more than $120 million.
   In its statement Thursday, the company said it was not reporting
its fourth quarter results yet because it was ``in the process of
reviewing the provision for loan losses to determine how it should
be allocated among the 1989 quarters.''
   Ryan said the bank ``possibly'' could increase provisions in the
previous quarters but no decision has been made. The statement
indicated that overall provisions for 1989 would not change.
   Analysts said the bank's statement indicated the company and its
auditors were trying to determine whether the first three quarters
should have contained larger provisions against bad loans.
   ``They are going to put 1989 back together again the way it
should have been,'' Moynihan said.
   Gerard Cassidy, an analyst with Tucker Anthony Inc., said Bank
of New England had plenty of signs earlier in the year that its
loan portfolio could sour. The economy had already started its
downturn, and Bank of Boston Corp., the region's largest bank,
reported a record $125 million loss in the third quarter.
   ``It tells you someone was asleep at the switch,'' Cassidy said.
   ``Needless to say, in this type of situation there will be
lawsuits'' from shareholders, he said.
   The $1.11 billion loss for the year, which translated to $16.11
a share, compared with earnings of $281.7 million, or $4.06 a
share, in 1988.
   As of Dec. 31, 1988, the bank had $32.2 billion in assets, but
that number shrunk to $26.1 billion by Feb. 15, with much of the
decline coming since Jan. 1, the bank said.
   The bank has been trying to sell $6 billion in assets to raise
cash, and its primary capital ratio improved to 8.6 percent on Feb.
15, compared with 7.1 percent at year's end.
   ``The numbers we reported today were in line with our January
estimate,'' H. Ridgely Bullock, the bank's interim chairman, said
in a statement. ``In the near term, we are proceeding in an orderly
fashion to reduce overhead as a part of our downsizing program.''
   ``We are presently developing a longer term strategic plan to
improve operations and lead the company on a road to
profitability,'' he said.
   The bank said last week it expected to lay off about 2,000
employees, although the specific details were not yet determined.
   The bank also said earlier this year that it planned to enter a
consent order with the federal government to detail what steps it
would take to improve its financial condition, but that order has
not yet been disclosed.

<HEAD>Spray String Recalled After Several People Burned</HEAD>

   The government is recalling more than a
million cans of spray string confetti because the strings that are
sprayed as a party ornament are flammable.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday it recalled
the spray string ``because of several terrifying accidents that
occurred when this type of product was sprayed near lit candles on
birthday cakes and burst into flames,'' said Jacqueline
Jones-Smith, who heads the panel.
   ``These accidents resulted in serious burn injuries, primarily
to children,'' she said.
   In a dramatic demonstration, commission staff members showed
reporters how a flash fire could result from spraying the string
near lit candles.
   They also showed a home video of a 6-year-old Clarksville,
Tenn., boy who suffered severe burns when some of the string was
sprayed during his birthday celebration.
   The boy, Michael Sheppard, suffered first- and second-degree
burns to his face and body last November, said CPSC spokeswoman Amy
Palman.
   At least eight people, three adults and five children, suffered
burns, she said.
   Last month the CPSC recalled 3 million cans of another spray
string produced by a New Jersey-based manufacturer that has since
reformulated its propellant.
   Thursday's recall involved 1.13 million cans of the streamers
from five manufacturers.
   The products are:
   _3.5-ounce cans of ``Streamer Spray,'' distributed by Northeast
Imports, Inc. of Central Falls, R.I.
   _150-gram cans of ``Masquerade Crazy Strings,'' distributed by
Masquerade, Inc. of Brooklyn, N.Y.
   _3.5-ounce cans of ``Goofy Flying String,'' distributed by
Franco-American Novelty Co., Inc. of Glendale, N.Y.
   _3.5-ounce cans of ``Tricky Fun String,'' distributed by
Topstone Industries of Danbury, Conn.
   _3.5-ounce and 7-ounce cans of ``It's Fun Time String
Confetti,'' distributed by Fun World Division of Carle Place, N.Y.

<HEAD>Retailers Get More Time to Consider Lease Agreements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN NOLAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied
Stores Corp. received a bankruptcy court's open-ended approval for
more time to consider whether to continue leases at their 260 store
locations nationwide.
   But U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. said Thursday he
might reconsider and set a fixed deadline if his court sees a flood
of challenges from developers or mall operators who demand earlier
decisions because of their own financial deadlines.
   Aug gave permission for Federated and Allied to postpone making
the lease decisions until a reorganization plan is in place, which
company officials say could occur in May. Aug agreed in court
Thursday not to set a deadline, said David Heiman, a
Federated-Allied lawyer.
   Federated and Allied lawyers cleared the way for Aug's decision
by negotiating a proposed agreement during a court recess Thursday
that would require the companies to operate the stores until a
lease was canceled. The proposal would require that lease
rejections be subject to hearings in the bankruptcy court so that
objectors could make their arguments.
   ``We expect only a handful of rejections, ultimately,'' Heiman
said.
   He declined to say how much advance notice the retailers might
provide. ``I'm sure that as soon as we make a decision, we will
contact the landlord,'' Heiman said.
   The Cincinnati-based retailers have refused to say which leases
might be canceled, saying only that some unprofitable stores are at
stake. Federated and Allied both filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization petitions Jan. 15 to obtain protection from
creditors during their reorganizations. The companies listed $7.7
billion in debts, amassed when the Toronto-based Campeau Corp.
bought Allied in 1986 and Federated in 1988.
   Operators of shopping malls and stores from iami Beach, Fla., to
Pocatello, Idaho, are concerned that Federated and Allied give
notice as soon as possible about whether they intend to continue
leases.
   Stanley Talesnick, lawyer for Melvin Simon &amp; Associates, an
Indianapolis-based mall operator, said he expects responses from
Federated and Allied within a few weeks or months about lease
decisions.
   Melvin Simon controls 66 million square feet of retail space in
200 shopping centers. The company also is concerned because it
plans to build the $625 million Mall of America in Bloomington,
Minn. Uncertainty about a Bloomingdale's store planned for the mall
is delaying a $600 million loan needed to start construction.
   Lawyers for developers JMB Realty Corp. and Melvin Simon say
long delays in those decisions could hurt tenants of shopping malls
that are anchored by such Federated and Allied stores as Lazarus or
Bloomingdale's.
   Under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act, a company filing
for protection from creditors has 60 days to decide whether to end
lease agreements. For Federated and Allied, the deadline is March
14.
   JMB Realty is the developer of the 900 N. Michigan Ave. project
in downtown Chicago, which includes a Bloomingdale's store. JMB has
plans to renovate a shopping center in suburban Skokie, Ill., to
include a new Bloomingdale's.
   Aug on Thursday approved continued Federated and Allied spending
for auto liability and workers' compensation insurance policies
from Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., which cost the companies $11
million a year; operation of a centralized cash management system
that records the flow of money between subsidiaries and corporate
offices; and contracts for outside operation of New Jersey
merchandise distribution centers that serve the Bloomingdale's and
the Abraham and Straus stores.

   Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama today called for
urgent Cabinet-level trade talks, saying U.S. demands at
lower-level discussions on the U.S.-Japanese trade imbalance were
stronger than expected.
   American officials criticized Japanese negotiators in the talks,
saying they would not go far enough in efforts to reduce Japan's
$49 billion trade surplus with the United States.
   ``We must say we find ourselves frustrated and concerned at this
point,'' Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Linn Williams told
reporters after the two-day negotiating session ended today.
   ``We expected this meeting to be a substantial step forward. But
what we heard is not enough to be effective, lasting or credible,''
he said. ``It was mainly a defense of the status quo with prospects
of only minimal further action.''
   Nakayama told reporters the U.S. demands were ``much severer''
than Japanese officials had expected.
   He called for an urgent meeting of top government officials,
after Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu names a new Cabinet next week,
to clear up disagreements aired in talks at the bilateral
sub-Cabinet level.
   The Japanese side today was given a chance to critique U.S.
plans for structural trade reform.
   This round of trade talks _ known as the Structural Impediments
Initiative _ was delayed from early January until after national
parliamentary elections Sunday that kept the conservative Liberal
Democratic Party in power.
   Since the structural trade talks were launched in May, U.S.
officials have pressed Japan for evidence of willingness to carry
out wide-ranging reform to help reduce Japan's trade surplus with
the United States.
   Today, it was the United States' turn to explain what it is
doing to change American practices that contribute to the
imbalance. U.S. officials said they would outline Washington's
plans to increase the low U.S. savings and investment rates and to
bolster the competitiveness of American firms.
   The U.S. timetable for these changes was unclear.
   Japan says U.S. problems contributing to the trade imbalance
include inadequate savings and investment, the short-term nature of
U.S. corporate strategies, ineffective labor training and education
and insufficient export promotion.
   Japanese officials contend many of the U.S. demands for change
in their economy cannot be carried out as quickly as Washington
hopes.
   U.S. officials say Japan's high savings and investment rates,
its land policies, exclusionary business practices, inefficient
retail distribution networks and pricing mechanisms all indirectly
restrain trade.
   In response to those complaints, the Japanese side on Thursday
explained measures in a draft budget before Parliament to improve
enforcement of anti-monopoly laws; to increase spending on public
infrastructure such as roads and sewers, and to reform the retail
distribution system.
   They also explained revisions of Japan's land use law aimed at
curbing real estate speculation and increasing the supply of
available land in urban areas.
   Members of the U.S. delegation said the plans ``represented new
actions and some progress, but it's clear to us they haven't gone
as far as we hoped with bold, new thinking.''
   Japanese officials said the U.S. side had asked Japanese
spending on public works be increased to 10 percent of the nation's
gross national product from the current 5 percent, or $257 billion,
a demand they refused.
   They said they also could not agree to a demand to scrap a law
that requires firms wanting to open department stores or
supermarkets to obtain consent from existing smaller shops that are
generally reluctant to face new competition.
   The U.S. side says the law tends to restrict imports by driving
up prices and by limiting the number of foreign-owned stores and
the opening of large Japanese stores more likely to sell imported
products.

   Japanese traders unnerved by the wild swings that
have roiled their stock market are blaming a culprit new to them
but familiar to their American counterparts _ computerized program
trading.
   Program trading strategies, which involve moving huge blocks of
stocks with the flick of a computer key, long been a standard
procedure on U.S. markets. One of the best known practices is index
arbitrage, which involves buying or selling stocks with opposite,
offsetting trades in stock index futures.
   But such practices _ in which U.S. firms appear to be major
players in the Tokyo market _ are new and exasperating to the
Japanese.
   ``We never thought share prices on the Tokyo market would ever
go wild as they did this week,'' Michio Katsumata of Nomura
Securities Co., Japan's largest brokerage, said today.
   ``Since foreign traders brought in the method of arbitrage
trading by computer into the Tokyo market, share prices here began
strange fluctuations we have never seen before,'' he said.
   Even the government appeared confounded by the trading
strategies. The Finance Ministry today directed securities
companies to report on their arbitrage practices. A government
official speaking on condition of anonymity said the ministry is
not yet ``quite sure what to do to solve the problem.''
   The 225-issue Nikkei index, the main indicator of the world's
biggest stock market, has dropped 2,569.35 points, or nearly 7
percent this week alone and is off more than 10 percent since the
beginning of the year.
   Today, only two days after the benchmark index suffered its
third-largest decline, the Nikkei index lost another 2.61 percent
to close the week at 34,890.97.
   It was the first time the index fell below the 35,000-point mark
since Oct. 17, 1989.
   Of primary concern to Japanese dealers, investors and finance
ministry officials was the unusually wide range of price
fluctuations recently.
   On Thursday, for example, the Nikkei opened more than 400 points
higher as investors took advantage of the previous day's steep
price plunge to buy stocks. But it fell more than 1,000 points in
less than an hour. At day's end, however, the index rebounded to
close with a slight gain.
   Traders attributed the bearishness to anxiety about a possible
interest rate hike, expected shortly, coupled with unstable
currency rates.
   But they believe such fluctuations ``must come from arbitrage
program trading,'' said Ichitaro Watanabe of Nikko Securities Co.
   Traders noted that the market is particularly vulnerable to
computerized selling because of the extremely thin volume of shares
being traded.
   Program trading has received its share of criticism in the
United States, where the practice was blamed for contributing to
Wall Street's stock market crash in October 1987. Because of public
outcry over index arbitrage's role in the stock market's
roller-coaster performance, several major Wall Street investment
houses have suspended the practice, and the New York Stock Exchange
agreed to limit computerized program trading in times of sharp
market declines.
   ``The Japanese market has not yet developed an effective immune
system against such new methods of computer-aided trading,''
Watanabe said. ``As a result, most market players are only watching
recent unstable movements of share prices and the index from the
sidelines with their mouths open.''
   He noted that computers can buy and sell stocks ``beyond the
speed of human judgment. Unless we familiarize ourselves with
program trading, we are virtually defenseless against steep ups and
downs in share prices.''
   Dealers said the U.S.-based firms Salomon Brothers Inc. and
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc. are the two major users of arbitrage
trading in Japan.
   A dealer with a major Japanese securities house, commenting
anonymously, said: ``I knew something like this would happen when
the Finance Ministry decided to allow foreign companies into the
Tokyo exchange.''

   The stock market was mixed in early trading
today on the heels of a plunge in share prices on the Tokyo and
London exchanges.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.18 points to
2,579.95 in the first half hour of trading.
   But declining issues outnumbered gainers by nearly 4 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
204 up, 785 down and 423 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.44 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   In Japan, the key Nikkei index fell 935.87 points, or 2.61
percent, its fifth-worst drop ever. The decline, to 34,890.97
points, was blamed on computerized selling and concerns about
interest rates.
   The fall came two days after the Tokyo market's third-largest
decline, which sent stocks plunging in London and New York before
the U.S. market recovered for the day.
   The Nikkei's decline over the past few days put the index of 225
selected issues down 2,569.35 points _ or nearly 7 percent _ for
the week. It broke the 35,000 level than experts thought would
serve as a barrier for the market's recent slide.
   Stocks elsewhere overseas also fell. By midday in London, the
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off 30.6 points,
or 1.3 percent, at 2,238.6.
   Among blue-chip issues in early U.S. trading, General Electric
was down \ to 60{, Philip Morris was down \ to 37~, IBM was down &lsqb;
to 103&lsqb;, Exxon was up &rsqb; to 47{ and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
was up &lsqb; to 38\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained a scant 0.02 to 180.30. At the American Stock Exchange, the
market value index slipped 1.10 to 352.25.
   On Thursday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed down
8.79 to 2,574.77 after a last-minute selloff erased earlier gains.
   Advancing issues nearly matched declining issues in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 715 up, 753
down and 508 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 184.32 million
shares, up from 159.24 million in the previous session.

   Grand Metropolitan PLC, the British food, liquor
and retailing giant, confirmed Friday that it was negotiating with
Elders IXL Ltd. of Australia over the sale of its brewing
operations.
   But Grand Met spokesman Bill Bullard also said Grand Met was
negotiating with another potential buyer, whom he refused to
identify.
   The confirmation follows a statement made earlier Friday by
Elders in which it disclosed discussions with Grand Met about a
``major transaction which both parties expect will be brought to a
conclusion in the near future.''
   Analysts said they believe the deal would call for Grand Met to
swap its breweries for some of Elders' 5,000 pubs in Britain.
   Grand Met owns 4,900 pubs and four breweries, which brew its own
brands and other brands under license, such as Budweiser, Fosters
and Carlsberg.
   Some analysts say Grand Met also might acquire a stake in
Elders, which is planning a corporate restructuring.
   Grand Met declined to elaborate on the discussions. Bullard
would only repeat that the company hopes to make a decision about
its brewing interests sometime in the second quarter.

   A new reorganization agreement between Eastern
Airlines and its unsecured creditors would require sister carrier
Continental Airlines to step in and make some payments to the
creditors.
   The unsecured creditors, who are owed $980 million by Eastern,
would receive about $490 million in cash and notes under the plan
announced Thursday.
   The agreement capped several days of intense negotiations
between officials of Miami-based Eastern and a committee
representing the unsecured creditors in Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings, which Eastern entered last March.
   If the bankruptcy court approves the plan, Eastern says it could
fly out of Chapter 11 this summer.
   A plan proposed several weeks ago by Eastern would have paid the
unsecured creditors only 10 percent of their debts in cash when the
airline emerges from bankruptcy protection, and 70 percent more
over the following 10 years, without interest.
   The unsecured creditors are mainly equipment suppliers such as
aircraft and engine makers who have no collateral backing up what
they are owed.
   Under the new agreement, the creditors would receive repayment
of 50 cents on each dollar owed.
   Eastern would pay them $300 million in cash when the plan was
approved by the court. Also, the creditors would receive another
$190 million in eight-year, 15 percent notes _ half issued by
Eastern and half by Houston-based Continental, which would
guarantee both sets of notes.
   Principal on the notes would begin to be repaid after the first
two years.
   Eastern said the new plan would allow the airline to emerge from
bankruptcy protection by mid-year ``with substantial cash resources
and a significant debt reduction.''
   Eastern and Continental are both subsidiaries of Houston-based
Texas Air Corp., the nation's largest airline company. Eastern's
previous reorganization proposals, including a plan to offer the
unsecured creditors 40 percent of Eastern's equity, hadn't involved
the assistance of Continental or Texas Air.
   In a separate development, Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo said
Thursday that merging Continental with Eastern makes sense, but is
not planned in the foreseeable future.
   ``We have no near-term plans for a merger,'' Lorenzo said in a
speech to around 1,500 Continental employees at Stapleton
International Airport in Denver. However, he added, ``today a
merger makes much more sense than it did two years ago.''
   In addition to requiring bankruptcy court approval, the new
agreement also is subject to completion of Eastern's proposed sale
of its lucrative South American routes to American Airlines, and to
a resolution of Eastern's labor dispute with the unions
representing pilots and flight attendants.
   Those two unions called off their sympathy walkouts last
November, but the airline had replaced the strikers mainly with
non-union workers as it rebuilt from the strike that started last
March 4. The Machinists union is still on strike against Eastern.
   The Air Line Pilots Association, which is represented on the
creditors' committee, called the agreement ``woefully inadequate in
terms of the amounts and types of payments to be made to the
various creditors.'' The union is one of the unsecured creditors
because of outstanding wage claims and pension obligations.
   Eastern still hasn't reached agreement with holders of its
preferred shares, who are owed about $1 billion. The preferred
holders objected to Eastern's earlier plan, which would have paid
them only 10 cents on the dollar, and called for the liquidation or
sale of the airline.
   The airline's exclusive right to file a reorganization plan
expired on Tuesday, but the creditors and preferred holders have
been negotiating with Eastern to try to agree on a consensual plan.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders looked
for new direction after Thursday's late rally in the wheat and corn
markets.
   Analysts said corn futures appear to be attracting more
speculative interest after posting moderate gains in each of the
last three trading sessions, but the recent runup has made some
observers wary of the potential for a downward correction.
   The number of newly established positions in the corn market
rose by 4,000 Thursday, a ``huge increase,'' according to John
Frazier, an executive vice president of Balfour Maclaine Corp. who
works on the exchange floor.
   ``Frankly,'' he said, ``when you see that, people tend to think
the speculators are too much on one side of the boat.''
   One bearish factor this morning was a report in the Journal of
Commerce quoting a top Soviet grain buyer as saying the Soviet
Union will buy significantly less U.S. grain this year than last.
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to 1 cent lower
with the contract for delivery in March at $3.88{ a bushel; corn
futures were { cent lower to \ cent higher with March at $2.45 a
bushel; oats were unchanged to \ cent lower with March at $1.37\ a

<HEAD>New Wall Street Trick: Transforming Junk into Investment-Grade
Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM BUERKLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investment bankers looking to inject life into a
moribund market are pushing one of Wall Street's more novel
repackaging ideas: turning junk bonds into investment-grade
securities.
   The collateralized bond obligation, or CBO, has grown from
scratch into multibillion-dollar market in two years.
   Some bankers think the market's size could double this year
alone, and in the process bring some fresh demand into a junk-bond
market sorely in need of buyers.
   ``I think it has some potential to grow because what it does is
put bonds in the hands of long-term holders,'' says Timothy P.
Norman, a vice president at Duff &amp; Phelps Investment Management,
which manages more than $25 billion from its Chicago offices.
   Norman manages one of the biggest CBOs done to date, a $301
million deal completed last November.
   The concept, he says, is sound even if the idea of turning junk
into grade-A investment material seems like financial alchemy.
   The CBO pools bonds issued by a number of different companies to
minimize the risk of defaults. Then, it apportions interest and
principal payments flowing from the junk pool to several tiers of
investors.
   The top tier or tiers has first priority to payments. Only after
they receive their interest and principal does money trickle down
to investors at the bottom tiers, where the risk as well as the
potential returns are much greater.
   ``You're able to take a pool of junk bonds and basically carve
the risk up and sell it to a buyer who wants a part of it,'' says
Andrew Kimball, an associate director who helps issue ratings for
CBO deals at Moody's Investors Service.
   In Norman's case, Duff &amp; Phelps bought just over $300 million of
junk bonds, repackaged them under the name of D&amp;P CBO Corp. and
then sold off stakes of the pool to four classes of institutional
buyers.
   The top tier, totaling $240 million, got a solid single-A rating
from Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   Investors buying into that tier _ mainly insurance companies _
were promised a return of 10.05 percent over an average life of
seven years. That was a little more than 1 percentage point above
the yield on conventional single-A-rated corporate bonds at the
time the deal was done, Norman said.
   The next level, having a subordinated claim on payments from the
pool, totaled $45 million and was priced to yield about 13\
percent, Norman said. The risk at this level didn't merit an
investment-grade rating.
   The third tier of $16 million was packaged as a bond paying
about 15\ percent. The remainder of $7 million was an equity rump
entitling the holders to any money left after the top three classes
of investors are paid off.
   The two bottom tiers were bought by a limited partnership that
includes Duff &amp; Phelps itself and a handful of other institutions
willing to accept high risk.
   As manager, Norman monitors the underlying credit standing of
the junk bonds held in the pool. As long as they continue to pay
interest, he doesn't have to worry if the price of the bonds falls
in the open market. ``It's a cash-flow exercise,'' he says.
   Ann Thoke, a First Boston Corp. director who helped put together
a $200 million CBO for a group led by Equitable Capital Management
Corp. earlier this month, says the instrument is winning
acceptances from institutional investors after some initial
skepticism.
   The Equitable deal included two senior tiers of $75 million
each, which won strong ratings of Aa1 and Aa2 from Moody's. The
package is designed to protect investors even if half the
underlying junk bonds default.
   That might sound hard to achieve, but Equitable did it by buying
junk bonds yielding perhaps 13 percent to 14 percent and then
paying closer to 10 percent interest on the investment-grade
portion of the CBO. The difference goes into a reserve that
provides coverage in case of any junk defaults. If there are few or
no defaults, the bottom-tier investors share the reserve.
   The depression in the junk bond market makes it a little easier
to put CBO packages together simply because bonds can be bought so
cheaply, Thoke says. The state of the junk market is so bad,
however, that some potential investors are leery of buying
repackaged bonds, she adds.
   Still, Kimball of Moody's forecasts that banks will repackage
$3.9 billion of junk this year, up from $2.8 billion last year and
$900 million in 1988.
   Thoke is even more ambitious. She says there are $1 billion
worth of deals already in the pipeline, and predicts there could be
twice as much paper repackaged this year as in the past two years
combined.

   The stock market fell this morning on the heels
of a steep drop in share prices on the Tokyo and London exchanges.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 20.04 points to
2,554.73 at noon EST.
   Declining issues outnumbered gainers by nearly 4 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
283 up, 1,050 down and 471 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 81.50 million shares as of noon.
   The Dow began the trading day with a drop, then recovered, then
fell again.
   ``The market is weaving and bobbing,'' said Ralph E. Blair, a
partner in the trading department of Montgomery Securities Inc. in
San Francisco. ``It's got nervous jitters from the Japanese market
being down last night.''
   In Japan, the key Nikkei index fell 935.87 points, or 2.61
percent, its fifth-worst drop ever. The decline, to 34,890.97
points, was blamed on computerized selling and concerns about
interest rates.
   The fall came two days after the Tokyo market's third-largest
decline, which sent stocks plunging in London and New York before
the U.S. market recovered for the day.
   Stocks elsewhere overseas also fell today. By midday in London,
the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off 30.6

   Stock prices ended sharply lower Friday in a
gloomy session on London's Stock Exchange, with investors
frightened by another plunge in Tokyo.
   Dealers said many investors took cover on the belief that global
stock markets will be heading lower before advancing again. The
markets have been unsettled by fears of higher interest rates.
   ``It's very nervous with plenty of potential sellers,'' said one
dealing director at a London investment firm. ``You almost feel as
if any uptick in the market would be a good enough excuse to sell
it again. It doesn't look good.''
   In the last week alone, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index has skidded nearly 85 points, or 3.7 percent, in
jittery trading.
   Dealers said Wall Street's halfhearted attempt to steady during
the London aftrnoon Friday faltered, dragging British equities down
with it.
   At the London close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was 32.5 points, or 1.4 percent, lower at 2,236.7,
above the session low of 2,228.3 but off from its high of 2,248.4.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was down 27.5 points at
1,762.3 at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index fell
17.48 points to close at 1,214.45.
   Volume came to a moderate 467.7 million shares, compared with
398 million shares Thursday.

<HEAD>Japan-U.S. Trade Talks End With Few Signs Of Progress</HEAD>

   Talks between the United States and Japan on
reducing the $49 billion trade imbalance between the two countries
ended here Friday with few signs of progress and ample evidence of
mutual frustration.
   ``We must say we find ourselves frustrated and concerned at this
point,'' Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Linn Williams told
reporters after the talks.
   Japan's Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama, meanwhile, called for
urgent Cabinet-level meetings, saying U.S. demands were ``much
severer'' than Japan had expected.
   Williams said U.S. officials had expected to make substantial
progress in the negotiations, aimed at addressing the underlying
causes of Japan's persistent huge annual trade imbalance with the
United States.
   ``But what we heard is not enough to be effective, lasting or
credible. It was mainly a defense of the status quo with prospects
of only minimal further action,'' Williams said.
   Japanese officials during the two days of meetings defended
their plans to beef up enforcement of anti-monopoly laws, improve
customs and patent systems, reform land use policies, increase
public works spending and ease restrictions on new store openings
in response to U.S. complaints.
   ``There's a clear message and already actions have been taken to
change the status quo,'' countered a Foreign Ministry official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   U.S. officials said they expected bolder proposals for change
after this round of trade talks called the Structural Impediments
Initiative was postponed for more than a month for Japan's national
parliamentary election. The election, held Sunday, returned the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party to power.
   ``We understand the election is just over and a new Cabinet is
yet to be formed,'' Williams said. ``But it is clearly time to get
ourselves focused.''
   Both sides described the atmosphere of the talks as good.
   Nakayama called for an urgent meeting of top officials from both
governments, after Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu names a new Cabinet
next week, to determine which problems should be dealt with and
when.
   Since the structural trade talks were launched last May, U.S.
officials have pressed Japan for evidence of willingness to carry
out wide-ranging reforms to help reduce Japan's $49 billion trade
surplus with the United States.
   The United States claims Japan's high savings and investment
rates, its land use policies, exclusionary business practices,
inefficient retail distribution networks and pricing mechanisms,
among other issues, indirectly restrain trade.
   Japan, in turn, has singled out inadequate savings and
investment, short-term management strategies and insufficient
education and worker training as major factors behind the United
States' $108.58 billion total trade deficit.
   On Friday, U.S. officials outlined plans to increase savings and
investment and to improve the competitiveness of American firms and
worker training.
   In response, Japanese officials said they suggested tax
incentives to encourage more applied research and development and
urged an easing of anti-trust regulations to encourage industrial
cooperation on new technologies.
   Officials on both sides declined to comment on specific areas of
disagreement, particularly with regard to U.S. plans for structural
reforms.
   Japanese officials contend that many of the U.S. demands for
change in their economy cannot be carried out as quickly as
Washington hopes. The Foreign Ministry official said he thought the
U.S. frustration stemmed from the ``long and complicated Japanese
decision-making process.''
   Williams, however, blamed ``lack of sufficient political
guidance'' for the slow progress. He also criticized Japanese plans
for mounting studies rather than taking legislative action in a
number of areas. Nonetheless, he said the U.S. side was ``open to
wait and see what develops from here.''
   But Charles Dallara, assistant secretary of the Treasury, warned
that trade negotiators could lose control of the negotiations if
progress isn't made soon.
   ``Others in the legislature who may have different solutions in
mind could have a great deal of influence over the outcome,'' said
Dallara, alluding to the possibility of more protectionist
legislation from an impatient U.S. Congress.
   President George Bush has stressed the importance of the talks.
And U.S. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney emphasized the importance
of the structural trade talks in a policy address here Friday.
   ``The growing friction between our countries on trade issues and
continued trade imbalances may, if unchecked, spill over into other
areas of mutual interest and concern,'' Cheney said.
   Both delegations have said they expected to produce an interim
report on progress in the talks by early April, after an additional
meeting in March. A final report is expected by summer.

   The Interstate Commerce Commission today
extended an order allowing three regional railroads to continue
operating for another month on the Delaware &amp; Hudson Railway tracks.
   ``The commission has extended it until 11:59 p.m. on March 23,''
Dennis Watson, ICC spokesman, said today. ``I guess everything is
basically the same.''
   The ICC ruled last week that the New York, Susquehanna &amp; Western
Corp., Lackawanna Valley Railroad Corp. and North Shore Railroad
Co. could run on D&amp;H tracks until 11:59 p.m. EST today while a
court-appointed bankruptcy trustee put together a temporary
operating plan.
   The D&amp;H, the nation's oldest continually operated railroad, runs
from Montreal to Washington and from Albany to Buffalo, N.Y.
   Trustee Francis P. Dicello has been putting together a plan
under which he would temporarily run the failing D&amp;H using
subsidies provided by New York, Pennsylvania, and the railroads and
shippers that use the line. Dicello must notify the ICC at least 48
hours before he is prepared to take over but his plan has not yet
been approved by the bankruptcy judge who is handling the D&amp;H's
reorganization.
   On Thursday, Dicello canceled a hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in Wilmington, Del., but Charles H. White Jr., counsel to the
trustee, said he would probably present the plan early next week.
   Under the plan, Dicello would run the 1,600-mile railroad for at
least one month using subsidies totaling approximately $500,000,
according to White.
   Those who would provide subsidies include three railroads _
Canadian Pacific Ltd., Canadian National Railways and Norfolk
Southern Corp._ and at least two shippers _ General Electric Co.
and International Paper Co.
   David Murray, a spokesman for the New York state Department of
Transporation, said New York and Pennsylvania would each put up
about $200,000 a month; the two shippers would contribute $25,000
apiece; the Canadian railroads some $50,000 each; and Norfolk about
$60,000.
   The trustee is hoping that the subsidies would keep the railroad
running until he can sell it or negotiate another permanent
solution.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., has threatened to
legislate Consolidated Rail Corp. to the bargaining table in an
attempt to save the D&amp;H.
   He said he, Rep. Norman Lent, R-N.Y., and Pennsylvania's two
senators were drafting legislation to force Conrail to deal with a
request to sell the D&amp;H trackage rights between Harrisburg, Pa.,
and Hagerstown, Md.
   An offer by Canadian Pacific Ltd. to buy the D&amp;H for $35 million
was withdrawn earlier this month because Conrail would not discuss
a proposal to allow CP to operate on that 90-mile stretch of tracks.
   ``It's not in the best interest of Conrail simply to force the
D&amp;H out of business, because if they do ... it will lead senators
like myself and the senators from Pennsylvania to sponsor
legislation which will re-regulate those railroads who become
monopolistic,'' D'Amato said on the Senate floor.
   ``I hope the Conrail people begin to listen to the message I am
attempting to send them.''
   But Conrail spokesman David Neurohr said Thursday that his
company's position remained unchanged.
   ``Conrail has not been offered anything of value in exchange for
the trackage rights nor has it been offered anything to offset the
harm that would be caused to Conrail's employees,'' Neurohr said,
reading from a prepared statement. `` ... In effect, they're
seeking a subsidy from Conrail.''
   D'Amato said Thursday that Conrail was seeking some $90 million
for the rights, which Neurohr would neither confirm nor deny.
   The D&amp;H filed in June 1988 or protection from its creditors
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy laws. The railway has debts
of about $100 million.

<HEAD>Saatchi Issues Says Profits ``Unlikely to Meet Market

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. PLC said Friday its 1990
profits were ``unlikely to achieve market expectations,'' and
disclosed that an American investment company has increased its
stake in the troubled British advertising agency.
   Saatchi, the world's largest advertising holding company, said
that Southeastern Asset Management Inc. of Memphis, Tenn., has
bought another 2 percent of the company's stock, raising its stake
in Saatchi to 13.2 percent.
   In a telephone call, Lee Blanchard, an administrative assistant,
said Southeastern said it had no comment on Saatchi's disclosure.
   Saatchi shares plunged 44 pence, or 75 cents a share, to 138
pence, or $2.36, a share on London's Stock Exchange Friday.
   Saatchi also confirmed that it was being sued in the United
States by a shareholder, but intends to ``vigorously defend'' its
case.
   A Saatchi official, who was not identified, in accordance with
British practice, confirmed that an American shareholder filed a
suit in California two weeks ago, alleging that Saatchi failed to
disclose difficulties stemming from the company's aggressive
acquisition policy beginning in 1985. The suit also claims that
Saatchi made a series of false or misleading optimistic financial
statements at that time.
   Warning about its 1990 profits, the company said the rate of
growth in the advertising industry was slowing, and that ``against
this background, the company was cautious about the short-term.''
   Saatchi posted a loss of 58.5 million pounds, or $100 million,
for its fiscal year ended Sept. 30.
   The company also said that it was in negotiations over the
disposal of all or part of its interests in each of its consulting
activities but that it was not in a position yet to make a more
detailed statement. The company previously announced its intention
to sell the businesses.

   The stock market seesawed today but then
stabilized at a lower level after share prices fell sharply on the
Tokyo and London exchanges.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 12.16 points to
2,562.61 at 2 p.m. EST.
   Declining issues outnumbered gainers by nearly 3 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
392 up, 1,019 down and 474 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 111.53 million shares as of 2
p.m.
   The Dow began the trading day with a drop, then recovered, then
fell again and stabilized.
   ``The market is weaving and bobbing,'' said Ralph E. Blair, a
partner in the trading department of Montgomery Securities Inc. in
San Francisco. ``It's got nervous jitters from the Japanese market

   In Japan, the key Nikkei index fell 935.87 points, or 2.61

   The fall came two days after the Tokyo market's third-largest

   Stocks elsewhere overseas also fell today. In London, the

   Among blue-chip U.S. issues, Philip Morris was down } to 37&rsqb;,

Warner-Lambert dropped 4 to 99&rsqb;, Bristol Myers-Squibb slipped 1 to

   Pfizer, the most-active NYSE issue, said it faces a number of
lawsuits over a heart valve once sold by a subsidiary that has been
criticized for a high failure rate. A Warner-Lambert drug for
Alzheimer's disease was the subject of a negative study reported in
a British medical journal; the company said the study is flawed.

   Several federal lawsuits have been
filed against Perrier Group of America Inc., claiming the company
knowingly sold bottled spring water that was contaminated with
benzene.
   Lawyers who filed suit here on behalf of B.B. Vahlsing of
Wynnewood, Pa., hope it will be declared a class-action lawsuit,
permitting them to represent customers of Perrier throughout the
country.
   ``These are people who have been ripped off,'' said Richard
Bieder, whose law firm, Koskoff, Koskoff &amp; Bieder, filed the suit
in U.S. District Court in Bridgeport on Tuesday.
   ``They are paying a premium price and they were paying the
premium because they believed it was pure when it came from a
spring,'' Bieder said.
   Perrier officials began a worldwide recall of their bottled
water last week, admitting that its spring waters naturally contain
benzene but saying it is usually filtered out.
   The Vahlsing lawsuit was filed in Connecticut because Perrier's
U.S. headquarters is in Greenwich.
   C. Oliver Burt III, Vahlsing's lawyer in Haverford, Pa., said
six to eight similar suits have been filed in U.S. District Court
in Philadelphia. He said the Pennsylvania suits, filed Feb. 16,
also seek damages against Perrier and ask the judge to declare a
class action.
   Perrier spokeswoman Jane Lazgin said attorneys hired by her
company had not yet had time to review the complaints thoroughly.
   ``Without really having seen the material, it really isn't
proper for us to comment. But it does seem groundless to us,'' she
said, adding the company felt it had taken the proper steps to deal
with the problem.
   The contamination question first arose on Feb. 9 when health
officials in North Carolina found benzene in several bottles of
Perrier. The company recalled 72 million bottles sold in North
America.
   The lawsuit charges that even though Perrier officials knew
differently, they first insisted that the contamination was limited
to a few bottles and that the problem was caused by a lone Perrier
worker who inadvertently contaminated a bottling machine by
cleaning it with benzene.
   On Feb. 15, the company admitted that benzene naturally
contaminates its spring in France and that contaminated bottles
occurred, in part, because workers failed to replace filters
designed to remove benzene from the water source.
   The company expanded its recall to 160 million bottles, worth
$70 million, around the world.
   The 15-page lawsuit alleges Perrier violated consumer protection
laws in several states by advertising its product improperly,
Bieder said.
   The suit also charges the company with violating the Racketeer
Influenced, Corrupt Organizations Act, and breaking common law of
fraud and negligent misrepresentation.
   The suit asks unspecified damages, based on Perrier sales
figures, mainly for emotional distress caused in finding out the
bubbly water contained benzene, Bieder said.
   The suit names Source Perrier SA, Perrier Group and Perrier
Group of America Inc. as defendants.

   Sweden's car maker Volvo and
Renault, the French state-owned automotive concern, announced today
they were acquiring major equity stakes in each other's car and
truck production operations in a bid to become more competitive.
   The companies said they also intended to enter into an
``extensive cooperation agreement'' under which they would
coordinate product development programs, purchasing operations and
investment plans.
   But they said each company would maintain its trademarks and
distribution organizations and would continue assembling and
marketing its own cars, trucks and buses.
   The announcement in the Dutch capital capped months-long rounds
of negotiations between the two companies, whose sales have been
under pressure in an increasingly competitive world market.
   Under the agreement AB Volvo and Renault will swap 45 percent of
the shares in their truck and bus operations, according to Raymond
Levy, Renault's chief executive officer. At the same time, Renault
agreed to acquire 25 percent of Volvo's car operations, while Volvo
would acquire 20 percent of Renault and an option to acquire
another 5 percent at a later date.
   Pehr Gyllenhammar, president of Volvo, said the agreement meant
both companies will ``maintain their integrity ... and will give
them the size breadth and depth well above the critical mass
necessary to survive in this fiercely competitive industry.''
   The stock swap covers an auto conglomerate which would account
for production of about 2 million units a year, or about 20 percent
of the European market, analysts said.
   The combination would produce more than 140,000 trucks, beating
the current leader in that field, Daimler Benz of West Germany, by
a margin of some 25,000 units.
   In 1988, the latest year for which figures were available,
Renault, which produced 1.6 million cars and 80,250 trucks last
year, more than doubled its net profit to 8.913 billion francs, or
$1.59 billion, from 3.689 billion francs, or $658 million, the year
before.
   Volvo's latest accounts showed an operating profit of 4.06
billion Swedish crowns, or $676 million, for the first nine months
of 1989, down 14 percent from the corresponding period a year
earlier. However, this figure excluded 750 million crowns, or $125
million, in non-recurring gains.
   In 1988, the Swedish company's car sales were down by 4 percent,
totaling 414,000 cars. In the same year, truck sales were up 25
percent to 60,200 units.
   Prior to today's announcement, trade in Volvo stock was
suspended at both the Paris and the Stockholm bourses. Renault, as
a French government agency, has no shares outstanding.

   The stock market seesawed today but then
stabilized at a slightly lower level after share prices fell
sharply on the Tokyo and London exchanges.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 5.18 points to
2,569.59 at 3 p.m. EST. Earlier, it was down by as much as 25
points.
   Declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
448 up, 972 down and 491 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 126.41 million shares as of 3
p.m.
   The Dow began the trading day with a drop, then recovered, then
fell again and stabilized.
   ``The market is weaving and bobbing,'' said Ralph E. Blair, a
partner in the trading department of Montgomery Securities Inc. in
San Francisco. ``It's got nervous jitters from the Japanese market
being down last night. (But) I think the market's taking the news
pretty well.''
   In Japan, the key Nikkei index fell 935.87 points, or 2.61
percent, its fifth-worst drop ever. The decline, to 34,890.97
points, was blamed on computerized selling and concerns about
interest rates.
   The fall came two days after the Tokyo market's third-largest
decline, which sent stocks plunging in London and New York before
the U.S. market recovered for the day.
   Stocks elsewhere overseas also fell today. In London, the
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index slipped 32.5 points,
or 1.4 percent, to close at 2,236.7 in nervous trading.
   Among blue-chip U.S. issues, Philip Morris was down } to 37&rsqb;,
IBM was down &rsqb; to 102~ and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was
unchanged at 38&lsqb;.
   Profit-taking hit Monsanto stock after it surged 4&rsqb; Thursday on

criticized for a high failure rate. A Warner-Lambert drug for
Alzheimer's disease was the subject of a negative study reported in
a British medical journal; the company said the study is flawed.

<TEXT>
   Money manager Mario Gabelli's acquisition of
nearly 14 percent of Media General's Class A common stock does not
represent a takeover threat, the company said Friday.
   Gabelli's investment group holds nearly 3.5 million shares of
Class A stock, or 13.7 percent of the company's total 25.8 million
Class A shares outstanding.
   Gabelli did not return several telephone calls to his New York
office on Friday.
   Class A shareholders have 30 percent of the voting power in the
company. The company's Class B stock, which is controlled by the
founding Bryan family, controls 70 percent of the voting power.
   Media General thwarted a hostile buyout attempt in 1988 by
Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman, who had acquired 10 percent of
the company's Class A shares.
   Robert W. Pendergast, spokesman for Richmond-based Media
General, said Friday the company is not concerned about another
takeover attempt.
   The company effectively thwarted Sugarman by winning a court
ruling upholding the legality of its dual stock structure and a
proxy fight in which Sugarman attempted to win three seats on the
company's nine-member board of directors.
   Media General swapped a California paper mill and made a $44
million payment to Sugarman in exchange for his stock and he agreed
to drop attempts to take over the company.
   ``He (Gabelli) started buying it (stock) around the time
Sugarman lost the proxy contest, and he has been a consistent
buyer,'' Pendergast said. ``He has indicated on several occasions
that Media General is a long-term, very profitable investment.
   ``Last week, he met with the management here and indicated that
he continued to believe it was an excellent investment,''
Pendergast said. ``We think it is very positive. We like people who
come in on the long term.''
   According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, a group led by Gamco Investors Inc. bought 267,400
shares of stock between Jan. 23 and Feb. 15 at prices ranging
between $27.97 and $30.50 per share. Gabelli is chief executive
officer of Gamco Investors.
   During the same period, the group sold 2,700 shares at prices
ranging between $29.12{ and $30.62{ per share.
   Media General Inc. owns The Richmond News Leader and the
Richmond Times-Dispatch newspapers in Richmond, newspapers in
Tampa, Fla., newspapers in Winston-Salem, N.C. and television and
cable systems elsewhere in the Southeast.
   George Shipp, a research analyst with Scott &amp; Stringfellow
Investment Corp. in Norfolk, said Friday he did not consider Media
General a takeover candidate.
   ``I think if Mr. Sugarman taught us anything, it was that this
company is not subject to a takeover,'' Shipp said. ``I've got to
take Mr. Gabelli's word that it's for investment.''
   Shipp also said the Bryan family had stated its continued
intention not to sell control of the company.

   Wheat and corn futures prices rose modestly
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade while soybean futures slipped,
continuing a pattern established in the previous session.
   Perceptions that the Soviet Union is preparing to buy more U.S.
corn supported corn futures, as did bullish comments made by
analysts at the National Corn Growers Association meeting in
Phoenix, Ariz.
   Several analysts told the corn growers that corn prices could
rise as much as 20 cents a bushel due to relatively low stockpiles
and strong demand for feed grains in the United States and abroad.
   The contract for March delivery of wheat surged more than 4
cents a bushel after gaining 5 cents on Thursday amid indications
of tight supplies for delivery against the March contract, which
enters its delivery phase on Wednesday.
   Soybean futures slumped on signs of continued slack demand for
soybean meal. The upcoming South American soybean harvest, which
will bring new supplies to market, is also beginning to weigh on
the futures market, analysts said.
   At the close, wheat futures were { cent to 4\ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in March at $3.93} a bushel; corn was \

   Stacks of firewood that used to be apple
trees are grim reminders of a year that began with a ``60 Minutes''
report on the chemical Alar and ended with orchards bearing
kindling instead of fruit.
   Alar, which farmers used to slow the ripening and improve the
crispness of their apples, entered the American consciousness last
Feb. 26 with an immediate and devastating impact.
   A symbol of health suddenly became a symbol of something else.
Not since the Garden of Eden have apples had such a bad image.
   Many of Washington state's 4,500 apple growers were looking
forward to a comeback year when CBS broadcast the ``60 Minutes''
segment based on studies done by the Natural Resources Defense
Council, a private consumer group.
   The NRDC report on pesticides in childrens' food, called
``Intolerable Risk,'' concluded that eating apples and apple
products from trees treated with the growth regulator Alar
increased cancer risk in children.
   The report said the adult tolerances for Alar used by the
federal government did not apply to children because they eat more
apples and apple juice than adults.
   The apple industry responded by vigorously protecting the use of
chemicals and denouncing the NRDC for scare tactics and a thinly
veiled attempt to remove all chemicals from food production.
   The industry also attacked the report as unscientific, and said
the federal government was the proper agent for determining which
chemicals were safe.
   The NRDC, which featured actress Meryl Streep, consumer activist
Ralph Nader, and other celebrities on a carefully planned anti-Alar
campaign, countered that federal regulation of chemicals was too
slow, Alar was unnecessary, and its health dangers had been known
for years.
   The truth quickly became lost amid the duels on the Donahue talk
show, the squabbles on a second ``60 Minutes,'' and the flip-flop
of federal regulators who first announced that apples were safe to
eat then pronounced Alar a probable carcinogen.
   That confused consumers, and produced spectacles like school
districts banning apples from cafeterias, one mother sending law
officers to confiscate an apple from her child's lunch, and grocers
hastily erecting signs that their apples were Alar-free.
   Growers of the nation's $1 billion apple crop suffered revenue
losses from lower sales and prices estimated at more than $100
million.
   ``It stayed in the press a long time,'' said grower Fred
Valentine. ``We thought it would be shorter than what it was.''
   Shortly after voluntarily removing Alar from the market last
June, Uniroyal Chemical Co. asked EPA to cancel the chemical's
registration, which in effect made the chemical illegal to use
after Nov. 17, 1989, said Lisa Engstrom, the EPA's special review
manager for Alar.
   Apple growers are still faced with prices below the cost of
production. They say the problem now is oversupply, not consumer
fear.
   But the downward slide started by the Alar scare has growers
across Central Washington ripping out unprofitable red apple
orchards and replacing them with pears or peaches.
   ``This is a disaster,'' said Terry Kelson, a field man for
Inland Fruit and Produce Co. of Wapato and owner of a small
orchard. ``I can never remember poorer returns.''
   He estimated that Washington growers, who produce 60 percent of
the nation's apples, might voluntarily rip out 10 percent of their
Red Delicious apple trees in the next year.
   The chemical that spawned the scare is technically known as
daminozide, and for two decades was sprayed on trees to keep apples
on the branch longer, making them redder and crisper and extending
the shelf life and harvest time.
   Janet Hathaway, an NRDC lawyer in Washington, D.C., and
co-author of the report, said the furor that caused Uniroyal to
remove Alar from the market has made farmers more aware they must
reduce chemical use.
   ``The most significant result by far is the improved awareness
among both growers and consumers that residues in food can be a
health issue,'' Ms. Hathaway said.
   While the NRDC contends its real target was government
regulators, most hurt by the report were the nation's 20,000 apple
growers, many of whom did not use Alar.
   ``My greatest regret is that growers were caught in the
crossfire,'' Ms. Hathaway said. ``People who are legally using
pesticides are very inadvertent targets of these types of
campaigns.''
   In Washington state, growers were hoping the high quality 1988
crop would help them rebound from a disastrous, weather-damaged
crop the year before. For six months they were right.
   But the Alar scare cut wholesale prices in half, and apple sales
slumped for several months. As stockpiles built up, wholesale
prices fell beneath the cost of production.
   A $9.5 million federal buyout late last summer, the first in the
history of the apple industry, failed to strengthen prices.
   When the record 1989 crop was harvested last fall, warehouses
were still holding 1988 apples.
   ``You've got holdover junk from the 1988 crop and the taint of
Alar and that started to lower prices,'' said Bill Gammie, of
Yakima's Jack Frost Fruit Co. ``The Alar thing is hurting us.''
   A state survey found that no Washington growers used Alar on the
present bumper crop.
   While prices are down 31 percent from last year, demand is
improving. As of Jan. 31, 36.6 million boxes had been shipped, vs.
34.6 million in the comparable year-earlier period.
   But wholesale prices for fresh apples hovered in the $8 per
42-pound box range most of the season, about $1 beneath the cost of
production.
   The value of orchards is also decreasing. The Yakima County
assessor's office recently estimated that the value of apple
orchards dropped an average of $1,700 per acre in the past year, to
about $3,700.
   Many in the industry insist that the public is fast forgetting
Alar.
   ``This issue became such a joke the way it was amplified. It was
much ado about nothing,'' said Tom Hale, president of the
Washington Apple Commission, an industry marketing group. ``Even
last April two-thirds of the people thought it was overblown.''

to make a ``correction.'' But that didn't necessarily mean Wall
Street would follow suit, he said.
   ``It's inaccurate to go on the day-to-day swings on the
(Japanese) market,'' he said.
   Other observers said the U.S. markets were more concerned today
about domestic economic uncertainties and pressure on corporate
profits.

<TEXT>
   Sweden's car maker Volvo and
Renault, the French state-owned automotive concern, said Friday
they intend to make sizeable investments in each other in hopes of
making both companies more competitive.
   The announcement, made during a news conference in the Dutch
capital, capped a year of negotiations between the two companies,
whose sales have been under pressure in an increasingly competitive
world market.
   Volvo has been suffering from the slump in European auto sales
on the previously profitable U.S. market, while Renault is rapidly
losing ground to the Japanese at the top end of the market.
   In addition to the equity investments, the companies said they
intended to enter into an ``extensive cooperation agreement'' under
which they would coordinate elements of product development,
purchasing and investment plans.
   But they said each company would maintain its independent
identity, trademarks and distribution organizations and would
continue assembling and marketing its own cars, trucks and buses.
   Under the agreement, the companies would exchange a 45 percent
interest in their respective truck and bus divisions.
   The plan calls for Renault to become a limited company in which
AB Volvo would acquire through a special issue 20 percent of the
shares and an option to obtain another 5 percent.
   Renault, at the same time, would acquire a 25 percent share of
the Volvo car operation. Moreover, Renault intends to buy a 10
percent interest in AB Volvo, the parent company of the Swedish
industrial giant.
   The value of the transactions was estimated at about $4.8
billion.
   The deal is subject to French government approval, but Raymond
Levy, Renault's chief executive officer, said that ``I wouldn't be
here if I hadn't been sure about the position of my government.''
   Volvo president Pehr Gyllenhammar told reporters that the move
``will give (the companies) the size, breadth and depth well above
the critical mass necessary to survive in this fiercely competitive
industry.''
   Describing the cooperation structure as ``an alliance, not a
merger or an acquisition,'' Gyllenhammar said the two companies
would work together on product development, purchasing raw
materials and parts, as well as production.
   ``The agreement does not infringe on the integrity of the names
and makes'' of Volvo's and Renault's product lines, Gyllenhammar
said, adding that worldwide, dealer networks and marketing
operations would remain separated.
   He added that Volvo and Renault will maintain their headquarters
in Goteborg, Sweden, and Paris, respectively.
   But he did not rule out the eventual development of a joint new
model.
   The Swedish-French agreement was expected to have far-reaching
consequences for the auto market in the European Economic
Community, also known as the EEC.
   In Brussels, the EEC Commission, the Community's executive body,
said it would review the proposed deal to assess its impact on
competition in the European Community motor vehicle market.
   A Commission spokesman said the it had been told informally
several months ago that talks were underway between Renault and
Volvo.
   Under a new law that takes effect Sept. 21, major mergers in the
12-nation Community must be submitted to the Commission for prior
approval.
   Analysts estimated the Volvo and Renault companies would produce
about 2 million vehicles a year, or about 20 percent of the
European market.
   The companies would produce more than 140,000 trucks, beating
the current leader in that field, Daimler Benz of West Germany, by
about 25,000 units.
   In 1988, the latest year for which complete figures were
available, Renault more than doubled its net profit to 8.913
billion francs, or $1.59 billion, from 3.689 billion, or $658
million, the previous year.
   Last year, the French company manufactured more than 1.6 million
passenger cars and 80,250 trucks.
   Volvo had an operating profit of 4.06 billion Swedish crowns, or
$676 million, for the first nine months of 1989, down 14 percent
from the corresponding period a year earlier. However, this figure
excluded 750 million crowns, or $125 million, in non-recurring
gains.
   In 1988, the Swedish company's car sales were down by 4 percent,
totaling 414,000 cars. In the same year, truck sales were up 25
percent to 60,200 units.
   Prior to Friday's announcement, trade in Volvo stock was
suspended at both the Paris and the Stockholm exchanges. Renault,
as a French government agency, has no publicly traded shares.

   The General Electric Co. entertained a
delegation of Soviet aviatio Geagea, said work was
under way to remove mines and sand barricades in the Dog River
region north of Beirut and along the Beirut River boulevard in the
city's eastern sector.
   However, police could not confirm that any roads have been
reopened.
   The conflicting reports reflected the mistrust which has
governed relations between Aoun and Geagea during the cease-fire.
Aoun's radio said there were ``no indications that the gunmen are
serious in efforts to end the crisis.''
   The respected daily An-Nahar said Palestine Liberation
Organization chief Yasser Arafat, who fought Lebanon's Christians
from 1975 until Israel expelled his forces from Beirut in 1982,
offered to transfer guerrilla troops from North Yemen to the
Christian enclave to disengage the warring factions.
   President Elias Hrawi, elected by Parliament in November with a
mandate to carry out a Lebanese peace plan, has dismissed Aoun as
military commander. However, Aoun does not recognize Hrawi's
authority.
   He also opposes the Syrian-backed peace plan, saying it should
have called for a complete withdrawal of Syrian troops from
Lebanon. The 40,000 Syrian soldiers came under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate, but Aoun says they are really acting as a
Moslem ally in the country's nearly 15-year-old civil war.

   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan urged athletes and sports associations to turn aside the
``blood money'' of tobacco company sponsorships Friday.
   Having cigarette companies sponsor sporting events implies that
smoking is healthful and lures young people to take it up, said
Sullivan, the nation's top health official, who has repeatedly
denounced smoking and cigarette makers in recent weeks.
   ``An athlete or sports figure should not allow his or her good
name, hard-earned image or integrity to be exploited by the tobacco
industry to push a product that when used as intended causes
death,'' he said.
   ``This blood money should not be used to foster a misleading
impression that smoking is compatible with good health.''
   Sullivan called on universities and other institutions to refuse
to host events sponsored by tobacco companies, and he urged
advertisers to ``shun the temptation of this tainted money, stained
by addiction, disease and death.''
   Sullivan spoke at a news conference called by a coalition of
health groups to protest sponsorship of women's tennis events by
Virginia Slims cigarettes.
   Virginia Slims has sponsored such events for two decades. It is
sponsoring 14 events on the women's professional tour this year,
including a tournament at George Washington University in
Washington this week.
   Steve Weiss, a spokesman for Philip Morris Cos. Inc.,
manufacturer of Virginia Slims, rejected the criticism and said
``we intend to be a sponsor of women's tennis for a long time into
the future.''
   ``We don't ask the players to smoke, or to endorse smoking, but
we do ask them to get out on the court and play some great tennis
... and that's what they do,'' he said. ``We're promoting
entertainment for people around the country.''
   Players on the tour also defend the company. Zina Garrison, one
of the top-ranked women players, said ``Philip Morris has always
been a classy organization, real good to us. ... They've done a lot
for women's tennis and as they say, women's tennis has come a long
way and they've been the reason.''
   Sullivan has become the federal government's most outspoken
opponent of smoking since he took on the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.
last month, condemning its plan to test-market a cigarette brand
aimed primarily at blacks.
   The next day, Reynolds canceled the plan.
   Now, the company intends to test-market a cigarette called
Dakota. Reynolds said that late last year it discarded a plan to
target the new cigarette to women and decided instead to aim for
all smokers of rival Marlboro with the new product.
   Sullivan said cigarette advertising that is ``designed to lure
young people, women, minorities or blue-collar workers, is
dishonest, irresponsible and unconscionable.''
   Earlier this week, Sullivan attacked tobacco company advertising
practices and called on television stations to donate free air time
to help educate viewers about the dangers of smoking.
   He also said he is asking hospital administrators across the
country to declare hospitals ``smoke-free zones,'' and he has told
the head of the Health Care Financing Administration to ask
hospitals that receive Medicare payments to ban smoking.
   He also urged those who receive Health and Human Services grants
to prohibit smoking where they work, and he has written to national
convenience store chains asking them to enforce laws prohibiting
the sale of tobacco to minors.
   Sullivan has declined to take a position on tobacco subsidies or
calls for higher taxes on tobacco products.
   ``My role is to put the facts out,'' he said. ``My role is to
advocate for those measures that will promote good health practices
for all of us.''
   The Virginia Slims of Washington tournament returned to George
Washington University this year, three years after being forced off
campus by a previous administration because of the tobacco
company's sponsorship.
   Steve Bilsky, executive director of athletics and recreation,
said that in allowing the tournament to return the school
considered the opportunities that result, including a scholarship
program for female minority medical students that is financed with
some of the proceeds and an arrangement that provides tournament
tickets to Washington young people.
   ``We seriously considered the pros and cons before making the
decision to house the tournament and concluded that we would do
more good for the community by having it here than not,'' he said
in a statement.

<HEAD>Wall Street Weathers Tokyo Plunge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices stumbled Friday on Wall Street but the decline
appeared mild compared with an overnight plunge in Tokyo, where
stocks took their fifth-biggest drop ever.
   The decline in Japan reverberated in key foreign markets, which
not only declined on the day but also posted big losses for the
week.
   Based on the Tokyo market's poor showing, analysts predicted the
Dow Jones industrial average would open as much as 40 points lower
when trading shifted to New York.
   The Dow did dip initially, but the key barometer moved into plus
territory within an hour. After seesawing throughout the session,
the Dow finished down 10.58 to 2,564.19. at the closing bell.
   Broader market indicators also dropped, with about two stocks
falling in price for every one that rose on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   The U.S. market's modest response to the turmoil in Tokyo, which
this past week suffered two of its five biggest drops ever, and
other potentially negative factors heartened some analysts.
   ``The resilience of the U.S. market is impressive,'' said Marc
Chandler, an analyst at MMS International in Chicago. ``Not only
has it shrugged off the collapse of the Japanese and other foreign
markets, but it was practically unaffected by the collapse of
Drexel,'' he said, referring to the downfall and ongoing
liquidation of junk-bond pioneer Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the
largest Wall Street firm to fail.
   Still, analysts aren't proclaiming a new bull market. Eugene
Peroni, a technical analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott in
Philadelphia said trading Friday was ``fidgety. ... The market just
doesn't seem to have much upside motivation.''
   Earlier Friday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues
fell 935.87 points, or 2.61 percent, in light trading to end the
week at 34,890.97. It was the first time the Nikkei has fallen
below the 35,000-point level since last October.
   The fall came just two days after the Tokyo market's
third-largest decline and put the Nikkei down nearly 7 percent for
the week.
   Japanese dealers have begun blaming program trading strategies
involving huge blocks of stock _ and the U.S. firms that generally
employ them on the Tokyo exchange _ for the recent wild and
unnerving price swings in their market.
   ``Since foreign traders brought in the method of arbitrage
trading ... share prices here began strange fluctuations we have
never seen before,'' said Michio Katsumata of Nomura Securities Co.
in Tokyo.
   But others argue that the Japanese market, which until recently
seemed to know no direction other than up, was ripe for a fall.
   ``It is quite possible to rationalize that (Japan is) a market
that has gone too high,'' said Charles Larkum, an equity analyst at
James Capel and Co. in London. ``It's a matter of coming down to a
more reasonable level.''
   While a decline in Tokyo was expected, the speed with which the
market has lost ground surprised many. Friday's tailspin rattled
European markets as well as Wall Street.
   At the close in London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was off 32.5 points, or 1.4 percent, at 2,236.7.
The index skidded nearly 3.7 percent for the week.
   In Frankfurt, stock prices closed sharply lower both on the day
and for the week. The DAX, one of West Germany's key stock gauges,
fell 30.51 points, or nearly 2 percent, to 1,789.64, its lowest
level in a month. The index lost 5.5 percent for the week.
   But European traders were not solely focused on Tokyo. Concern
has replaced euphoria over the eventual reunification of East and
West Germany, and traders are wary of the inflationary consequences
of unity.
   Analysts noted that interest rates are subtly driving the
world's stock markets.
   Weakness in the Japanese and German markets reflect ``where they
are in their business cycle,'' MMS International's Chandler said.
Rates are trending higher in these markets as their governments
attempt to stem inflationary pressures, while rates in the United
States have been retreating to prevent a recession.

   Energy futures prices finished mixed in
lackluster trading Friday, as crude oil continued to slump in the
face of a seasonal softness in demand.
   The April contract for West Texas Intermediate, the key grade of
U.S. crude oil, fell 33 cents to end at $21.42 a 42-gallon barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract finished the week
with a net loss of 83 cents a barrel.
   May crude finished 26 cents lower at $21.47 a barrel while June
dropped 17 cents to match April's price. Later contracts were mixed.
   ``Crude is continuing a seasonal downturn due to refinery
turnarounds and is continuing a realignment in relation to Brent
and other crudes,'' said John H. O'Connell, analyst for Refco Inc.
``It just got too far out of line.''
   Analysts say demand for crude oil has softened as major U.S. and
European refineries slow production for annual maintenance
overhauls. Several big refineries Friday lowered their posted price
for crude by 75 cents to $20.50 a barrel.
   Refined products traded on the New York Merc also ended mixed.
Unleaded regular gasoline for delivery in March, which rose 0.84
cent on Thursday, fell 0.40 cent to 59.85 cents a gallon. April
dropped 0.12 cent to 60.97 cents and May rose 0.46 cent to 65.40
cents a gallon.
   No. 2 heating oil for March delivery gained 0.15 cent to 58.30
cents a gallon, after closing up 0.62 cents in the previous
session. April heating oil advanced 0.29 cent to 57.27 cents and
May settled at 56.30 cents, up 34 cent.
   Analysts said forecasts for wintry weather in the Northeast
helped give heating oil a boost.

<HEAD>Company Recalls Catheters After Government Seizes Product</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the third time in the last year, a medical
products company recalled one of its catheters Friday after federal
authorities seized the devices and warned they could cause serious
harm.
   William Bopp, vice president of C.R. Bard Inc. in Murray Hill,
N.J., said his company instituted the recall Friday and was working
with the federal government to retrieve the product.
   U.S. marshals on Thursday seized 2,000 boxes of catheters
manufactured by Bard's USCI Division in Billerica.
   Gail Costello, spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration
in Boston, said Bard had received complaints about the catheters,
which are used to unclog arteries, but failed to fully investigate
the trouble.
   In addition, according to a Justice Department statement, the
company ``received complaints of malfunctions of the device
indicating that death or serious injury could result if the
malfunction were to recur, and yet failed to report the complaints
to the FDA as required by FDA regulations.''
   About 2,000 catheters were affected by the recall, Bopp said,
and the company was sending out letters to customers to inform them
of the action.
   ``I assume they are in use,'' Costello said. ``Of course there
is concern.''
   Last year, Bard recalled two other catheters, one because it had
a problem with tips breaking and the other because changes were
made without following FDA rules, Costello said. The two catheters
also came from the USCI Division.
   On the third catheter, the problems related to a balloon device
that inflates and presses against deposits blocking arteries, Bopp
said. In some cases, he said, the balloon would not deflate
properly, making it difficult to remove the catheter.
   In one case a malfunctioning catheter was used with a patient
who died, but Bopp said it has not been determined whether the
device caused the death.
   Bard started receiving complaints about the third catheter
shortly after it was introduced in late 1987, Bopp said.
   Regarding the reporting of complaints, Bopp said: ``We have a
corporate guideline that we believe complies with all the
requirements.''
   Costello declined to say how long the FDA has been aware of the
trouble, saying the case remains under investigation.

close at 2,564.19.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
468 up, 987 down and 510 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 148.49 million
shares, down from 184.32 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 174.77 million shares.
   The market had ``nervous jitters'' from the decline in the
Japanese market, said Ralph E. Blair, a partner at Montgomery
Securities Inc. in San Francisco.
   The key Nikkei index in Tokyo fell 935.87 points, or 2.61
percent, its fifth-worst drop ever. The Nikkei decline, to
34,890.97 points, was blamed on computerized selling and concern
about rising interest rates.
   The fall came two days after the Tokyo market's third-largest
decline, which sent stocks plunging in London and New York before
the U.S. market recovered for the day.
   Stocks elsewhere overseas also fell Friday. In London, the
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index lost 32.5 points, or
1.4 percent, to close at 2,236.7.
   In New York, the Dow slipped slightly at the open, then moved
above and below Thursday's close. A late-afternoon rally attributed
to computerized buying sent the Dow up about 3 points from the
previous day, but it retreated in the last half-hour of trading.
   Walter Murphy, a senior market specialist with Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. Inc., said many observers expected the overheated Tokyo market
to make a ``correction.'' But that didn't necessarily mean Wall
Street would follow suit, he said.
   Other observers said the U.S. markets were more concerned Friday
about domestic economic uncertainties and pressures on corporate
profits.
   Among blue-chip issues, Philip Morris was down | to 37{, IBM
fell { to 102}, USX gained ~ at 35&rsqb; and American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph was unchanged at 38&lsqb;.
   Profit-taking hit Monsanto stock after it surged 4&rsqb; Thursday on
news that the government approved its low-calorie fat substitute
for food products. Monsanto dropped 3{ to 108}.
   Pharmaceutical stocks also fell. Merck was down 1} to 68,
Warner-Lambert dropped 3| to 99}, Bristol Myers-Squibb slipped } to
51, Upjohn fell \ to 34 and Pfizer fell 3 to 56\.
   Pfizer, the most-active NYSE issue, restated its 1989 profit
downward Friday, from $727.3 million to $681.1 million, to reflect
a reduction in the value of a pigment division it plans to sell. On
Thursday, Pfizer fell 4{ over concern that the company may face
lawsuits from a heart valve once sold by a subsidiary that has a
high failure rate.
   A Warner-Lambert drug for Alzheimer's disease was the subject of
a negative study reported in a British medical journal.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $17.985 billion or 0.57
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.93 to 179.35.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 2.20 to 373.15, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index slipped 1.55 to 324.15.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
3.23 to 419.52. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index dropped 2.25 to 351.10.

<HEAD>Tower, Former CNO Zumwalt On Simmons' List Of Proposed Lockheed
Directors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Sen. John G. Tower, President Bush's
rejected choice to head the Pentagon, and three former military
commanders head billionaire Harold Simmons' nominees to replace the
board of directors at defense contractor Lockheed Corp.
   Simmons-controlled companies own nearly 12 million shares, or
18.9 percent of the common stock of Lockheed, maker of the Stealth
fighter plane and other military hardware, but the company has
rejected his request for six seats on the 15-member board.
   Chairman Daniel M. Tellep, who has met twice with Simmons since
he began investing in Lockheed, says Simmons has offered no
suggestions for improving the company, which has seen profits
plummet because of cost-overruns and a general downturn in the
defense business.
   Simmons revealed his nominees in a filing late Thursday with the
federal Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing also said
Simmons expected to spend $6 million on his proxy fight.
   Lockheed, based in Calabasas, Calif., said it would not comment
on the latest Simmons filing. The election of directors will occur
at the company's March 29 annual meeting in California.
   Analysts have suggested Simmons is seeking control of the board
to protect his $530 million investment in Lockheed, whose stock has
fallen well below the price he paid since he began accumulating the
stock in the fall of 1988.
   Simmons has paid a average of about $44 per share; Lockheed
closed at $36.25 a share Friday, unchanged from Thursday, in
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Tower, a Republican from Texas, spent 26 years in the Senate,
and was chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee when he
retired in 1985. His nomination by Bush to be secretary of defense
was rejected by the Senate amid allegations of womanizing and
drinking and disputes about Tower's ties to the defense industry.
   Tower now operates an investment company in Dallas and serves on
a foreign advisory panel to Bush. He was out of the country and
unavailable for comment, his office said Friday.
   Other Simmons' nominees include retired Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt
Jr., a former chief of naval operations; Hans Michael Mark, former
secretary of the U.S. Air Force; and retired Air Force Gen. Earl T.
O'Loughlin, who headed the USAF Logistics Command. Mark urrently is
chancellor of the University of Texas. Zumwalt's numerous business
activities include a seat on the board of NL Industries Inc., a
Simmons-controlled chemical company.
   Analysts had expected Simmons to include nominees with direct
military ties to blunt expected concern from the Pentagon over the
takeover of the nation's eighth largest defense contractor.
   Simmons and three of his executives or associates are among 11
others on the Simmon slate.
   Lockheed's current board includes Tellep and five other
executives of the company.

<TEXT>
   The dollar rose Friday against most major
currencies but continued to give up its usual place on center stage
to the Japanese yen.
   Gold prices slipped. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold
bullion for current delivery settled at $415 a troy ounce, down
from $415.70 on Thursday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted
a late bid for gold at $415.50 an ounce, down from $416.20 late
Thursday.
   Traders said the spotlight was again fixed on the yen, which
continued to lose ground as prospects faded for higher Japanese
interest rates. Dealers said they are expecting the Bank of Japan
to hike the nation's key discount rate.
   ``The yen has been center stage,'' said Robert Hatcher, a vice
president of foreign exchange at the New York office of Barclays
Bank PLC. ``We're still waiting for a move on (Japanese) interest
rates.''
   High interest rates make a country's fixed-income securities
attractive to investors, who need hard currency to make their
investments.
   The yen continued to slide against the dollar despite
interventions by the Bank of Japan to boost the currency, which
dealers said occurred twice in the Tokyo market, once later in
European trading and once in New York.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar rose strongly against the yen, closing at 146.47 yen, up
1.24 yen from Thursday's close. Later in London, the dollar was
quoted at 146.95 yen. By the end of the day in New York, the dollar
had jumped to 147.07 yen from 146.53 yen late Thursday.
   Market watchers said the dollar also benefitted somewhat from
concern about German reunification, which hurt the West German mark.
   The U.S. currency finished in London at 1.6779 marks, up from
1.6695 marks late Thursday. It continued the advance in New York to
end at 1.6785 marks, up from 1.6717.
   Also in London, the British pound fell to $1.7090 from $1.7145
late Thursday. Later, in New York, one pound fetched $1.7095, less
than $1.7133 late Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.4740 Swiss francs, down from 1.4755;
5.6825 French francs, up from 5.6620; 1,241.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,236.00; and 1.1983 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1949.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday,
included: 1.6779 West German marks, up from 1.6695; 1.4770 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4725; 5.6715 French francs, up from 5.6580;
1.8890 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8845; 1,240.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,234.25; and 1.1965 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1945.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $416.50 a troy ounce from
$417.45 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, Switzerland, the metal fell
to a closing bid of $415.50 from $417.25 late Thursday.
   Gold in Hong Kong dropped $3.14 an ounce to close at $413.69.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid of $5.27 a troy
ounce from Thursday's $5.28. On New York's Comex, silver for
current delivery closed at $5.238 a troy ounce, down from $5.268
late Thursday.

<HEAD>Corn Futures Keep Climbing On Supply Tightness, Steady Demand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn futures prices on Friday added to the steady gains of the
three previous sessions and analysts said strong demand and
relatively tight supplies could keep the market advancing into the
spring.
   On other commodity markets, wheat futures also rose Friday while
soybeans slumped; precious metals retreated; oil futures were
mixed; and livestock and meat were mixed.
   Corn futures settled } cent to 1{ cents higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade with the contract for delivery in March up } cent at
$2.45} a bushel.
   Wheat settled { cent to 4{ cents higher in Chicago with March at
$3.94 a bushel; oats were unchanged to } cent higher with March at
$1.37{ a bushel; soybeans were 1} cents to 3 cents lower with March
at $5.65\ a bushel.
   Friday's gain in the corn market was attributed largely to
perceptions that the Soviet Union is preparing to buy more U.S.
corn. But Soviet demand is just one of the factors contributing to
corn's slow, steady advance from about $2.37 a bushel at the
beginning of February.
   Analysts cite the Agriculture Department's Feb. 9
supply-and-demand report, which predicted the amount of U.S. corn
in storage on Aug. 31, the end of the current marketing year, at
1.48 billion bushels compared with an estimated 1.93 billion at the
end of the 1988-89 year.
   The relatively low ending stocks projection assumes continued
steady demand for feed grains in the United States and abroad.
   Heavy buying of futures on Friday by several major
grain-handling companies stirred speculation the Soviets were
getting ready to buy more U.S. corn after making some of their
largest purchases ever in December.
   ``The corn market, pure and simply, is bullish,'' said Pat
O'Connell, an analyst in Chicago with the futures brokerage Refco
Inc.
   He predicted the May contract, which settled at $2.53\ Friday,
could climb to $2.60 with little trouble.
   Merrill Lynch's senior grain analyst, Katharina Zimmer, told a
meeting of the National Corn Growers Association on Thursday that
corn usage warrants a near-term price increase of up to 20 cents,
and analyst Michael Mann of Blunt, Ellis and Loewi Inc. predicted
the December contract would rise from about $2.55 a bushel to $2.70.
   In other crop-futures news, the Agriculture Deparment said
Friday it had targeted the Soviet Union for sales of another 1
million metric tons of wheat at subsidized prices.
   Gold and silver futures edged lower on New York's Commodity
Exchange, reflecting a stronger dollar and surprise that the U.S.
stock market did not fall sharply following a steep drop Friday on
the Japanese stock market.
   Gold futures settled 70 cents to 80 cents lower with February at
$415 a troy ounce; silver futures settled 3 cents to 3.8 cents
lower with March at $5.24 a troy ounce.
   Crude oil prices for near-term delivery fell moderately on the
New York Mercantile Exchange amid perceptions of slack demand for
spot crude. Forecasts for cold weather in the Northeast supported
heating oil futures.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 33 cents lower to 19
cents higher with April at $21.42 a barrel; heating oil was .10
cent to .34 cent higher with March at 58.30 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .40 cent lower to .30 cent higher with March
at 59.85 cents a gallon.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures finished
mostly lower in line with weak cash markets. Most pork futures
advanced, lifted by firm cash markets and expectations for
tightening supplies of market-ready hogs.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department released its monthly
cold-storage report, which showed a higher-than-expected 79.5
million pounds of pork bellies in the nation's commercial freezers
as of Jan. 31.
   Live cattle futures settled .43 cent lower to .03 cent higher
with April at 75.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to
.23 cent lower with March at 80.22 cents a pound; live hogs were
.52 cent lower to .50 cent higher with April at 49.15 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .30 cent lower to 1.4 cents higher
with March at 54.25 cents a pound.

   Vehicle sales by the major automakers fell 12.1
percent in mid-February compared with last year as January's
minivan buying frenzy appeared to take some steam out of this
month's sales, the companies said Friday.
   The eight companies with North American plants reported selling
cars and trucks at an average daily rate of 32,258 during the Feb.
11-20 period this year, compared with a rate of 36,687 during the
same time last year.
   Car sales were down 1.5 percent, and truck sales, which include
minivans, slumped 13 percent. Truck sales in mid-January, when
Chrysler Corp. offered incentives on its popular minivan models,
were up 9.4 percent over the same period the previous year.
   The minivan rebates, the first Chrysler ever offered on the
popular vehicles, began Dec. 15 and ended Jan. 31.
   Combined sales of Chrysler's minivans _ the Dodge Caravan,
Plymouth Voyager and Chrysler Town &amp; Country _ exceed combined
sales of minivans made by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co.,
Toyota Motor Corp., Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Mazda Motor Corp.
   ``It's slow this month,'' said Alan Helfman, general manager of
River Oaks Chrysler-Plymouth in Houston. He said he sold about 100
minivans last month and ``I'll be lucky to get 30'' in February.
   In January, car and truck sales by the Big Three, which
accounted for about 90 percent of the sales of North American-built
vehicles, were up 4.1 percent compared with January last year. A
2.1-percent decrease in car sales was offset by a 13.9-percent
increase in truck sales, spurred by the Chrysler minivan rebates.
   Mid-February truck sales ran 4.7 percent behind truck sales
during the same period the month before. That's an indication that
some people who had planned to buy minivans in February may have
bought in January instead to take advantage of the incentives.
   ``They bought everything for the next six months because of
that,'' Helfman said of the rebates.
   So far this year, car sales for the eight companies were running
1.3 percent ahead of last year's pace and truck sales were up 5.9
percent. That works out to a combined car and truck sales pace 3
percent ahead of last year's rate.
   ``It tapered off a little bit at the first part of the month,''
said Patrick Callabretto, sales manager at Crowley
Chrysler-Plymouth in Bristol, Conn. ``With the rebates they
(minivans) sold very well. They were tough to come by.''
   Chrysler's combined car and truck sales for mid-February ran
17.6 percent below last year's pace with car sales down 13.7
percent and truck sales off 21.2 percent.
   But for the entire year, the No. 3 automaker's sales of domestic
vehicles were up 6.3 percent based on a 17.1-percent increase in
truck sales diluted by a 5.2-percent slide in car sales.
   GM's mid-February vehicle sales were down 16 percent compared
with last year, with car sales off 19.7 percent and truck sales
down 7.4 percent. So far this year, GM's cars and trucks were
selling at a pace 0.9 percent ahead of last year, with cars sales
down 2.2 percent and truck sales up 7.4 percent.
   Ford said its combined car and truck sales for mid-February were
down 14.7 percent as car sales dropped 13.7 percent and truck sales
fell 15.4 percent. So far this year, Ford's car sales were running
5.1 percent behind last year's pace and truck sales were down 1.9
percent, combining for a 3.8 percent decline in vehicle sales.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Up Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices rose slightly Friday, benefitting
from a sharp drop in stock trading overseas.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond was up 3-32 point,
or 94 cents for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield fell to 8.55
percent from 8.56 percent late Thursday.
   In Tokyo, computerized selling and worries that interest rates
are headed higher pushed stock prices into a tailspin, causing the
fifth-worst loss in history on the world's largest exchange. Stocks
in London also stumbled.
   In New York, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials lost 10.58
points to close at 2,564.19.
   Bond traders tracked the stock movements throughout the day
looking for signals on whether to buy or sell, said James Capra,
senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.
Trading was light.
   Capra said many market participants had expected a sell-off
following a sharp rise on Thursday, when the long bond gained 23-32
point after an auction of Treasury notes and upbeat comments on the
inflation outlook by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   ``The reaction was in terms of what really didn't happen,'' he
said. ``The market didn't sell off.''
   Capra said that if prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange did not
slide further in Monday trading he expected prices of U.S. Treasury
securities to decline next week.
   In trading in the secondary market for Treasury securities,
prices of short-term government issues were unchanged to up 1-32
point, intermediate maturities were unchanged and long-term issues
advanced 1-16 point to 3-32 point, according to figures provided by
Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.18 to 1,154.78.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds closed at 91 13-16, up 1-16 point. The
average yield to maturity declined to 7.42 percent from 7.43
percent late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.92 percent as the
discount lost 2 basis points to 7.67 percent. Yields on six-month
bills fell to 8.08 percent as the discount declined 2 basis points
to 7.67 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.09 percent as
the discount slipped 3 basis points to 7.54 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8\ percent, unchanged from
late Thursday.

<HEAD>Israeli Mystery: Killing at the Diamond Exchange</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RAMAT GAN, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stabbing murder of an Israel
Diamond Exchange dealer has sent shudders through an industry known
for such trust that deals for millions of dollars in precious
stones are sealed with a handshake.
   Israel's tight-knit diamond community has thrived on secrecy,
protected by an elaborate security system once reputed to be the
best in Israel outside military installations.
   So it was unusual that Diamond Exchange president Moshe
Schnitzer made a public statement earlier this month warning that
the killing had frightened buyers away from the world's largest
market for gemstones.
   ``Today, any buyer who comes asks, `Is it true there was a
murder here? Is this building secure?''' said Schnitzer, who has
run the exchange for more than two decades. ``We have to let the
world know that this is an isolated case that happened once in 50
years.''
   Thieves last month evaded the exchange building's security
system, stabbed Israeli broker Uri Shlibovsky to death in an
upper-floor office and purloined about $4 million in jewels.
   Newspaper reports have said a shutdown of video cameras during
the murder suggested an inside job, and some dealers expressed
fears that their private world of trust and security had been
breached.
   The setback in confidence couldn't have come at a worse time for
Israel's diamond industry, already beset by a squeeze in profits
and several other disquieting incidents.
   Last year, the industry was caught between slumping world sales
and a sharp rise in the cost of rough stones, controlled by the
South African De Beers marketing cartel in London. A half a dozen
diamond brokerages went bankrupt, and more than 2,000 cutters and
polishers were laid off.
   The diamond fraternity also was shaken last summer when a
financially troubled Israeli dealer fled the country, leaving
behind millions of dollars in debt. There also have been reports,
repeatedly denied, that Israeli and U.S. diamond markets are
laundering points for South American drug money.
   In Israel, the diamond exchange is the heart of three modern
high-rise buildings that make up the Diamond Center in this
northern Tel Aviv suburb.
   About 2,500 brokers, dealers and manufacturers are members, and
many spend their days seated at rows of simple, black wooden tables
buying and selling gems on the exchange floor.
   To the dealers, diamonds are known simply as ``goods,'' passed
around in small bits of folded white paper that belie their real
worth.
   The industry was born during World War II in what is now Israel,
when the historical diamond centers in Holland and Belgium were put
out of operation by the Nazi invasion. Israel's first dealers were
Jewish refugees from Europe who traded gems over coffee at Tel Aviv
cafes.
   Their sons and grandsons, often ultra-Orthodox Jews
distinguishable by their black homburgs, remain at the center of a
business that can operate on trust because of long friendships and
kinships.
   ``There are no contracts, no lawyers, no deposits,'' notes
diamond dealer Joseph Nadel, who has spent five decades in the
business. ``You make business with a `mazel'.''
   The word is Hebrew for ``luck,'' uttered when a deal has been
struck, be it for a sack of rough stones or a single, brilliant
solitaire.
   Nobody knows for sure how much business is transacted daily on
the exchange floor or in the dozens of private offices on upper
levels of the Diamond Center, admits Moshe Persky, deputy managing
director of the bourse.
   But each year, nearly half the world's gem-quality rough
diamonds pass through Israel for cutting and polishing in the
factories that line the alleyways around the exchange, he says.
   Last year, more than 7 million carats in rough diamonds were
imported into Israel, and 3.8 million carats in polished diamonds
valued at $2.74 billion were exported. A carat, the main measure
for diamonds, is one-fifth of a gram.
   The Diamond Center is protected by double gates, hidden video
cameras, metal detectors and an undisclosed number of guards that
scrutinize the 12,000 daily visitors. But evidently that now is
considered insufficient.
   Since the murder, a Canadian company named Technologia Systems
Ltd. has disclosed it's been retained by the exchange to embellish
the security with voice-identification checkpoints and a digitally
operated telephone system that records all calls.
   Inside the exchange, there are jail-like vaults for overnight
diamond storage, banks to arrange credit, armored trucks for
transport, specialized insurance agents, even courts to arbitrate
disputes.
   In the midst of this private, self-policing world, police are
seeking a murder suspect. A $250,000 reward has been offered for
information leading to the killer's capture.
   One broker, insisting on anonymity, said the most disturbing
question in the slaying was how the thieves carried it off: ``They
somehow managed to turn off the building's video cameras and get
away. It's very worrying.''

   Two congressional panels plan to look into the
circumstances surrounding the collapse of onetime Wall Street
powerhouse Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., it was disclosed Friday.
   The Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee
scheduled a hearing next Friday into the downfall of Drexel, whose
parent company filed for bankruptcy court protection last week in
New York.
   Among the scheduled witnesses are Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Richard C. Breeden, in what would be his first
public comment on the matter since Drexel Burnham Lambert Group
Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.
   Meanwhile, Rep. John D. Dingell, chairman of the House Energy
and Commerce Committee has asked the SEC to supply all the
information it has on bonuses Drexel paid to employees in the
months preceding its Feb. 13 bankruptcy filing.
   Drexel's parent company was forced to seek protection from some
2,000 creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code after
it defaulted on $100 million in loans and lenders refused to grant
new financing.
   Drexel said Friday it had paid $260 million in cash and stock
bonuses to top executives in December and January, but claimed the
decision to make the payments came long before its financial woes
became apparent. Earlier reports had indicated the bonus payments
had been as high as $350 million in the weeks preceding the
company's collapse.
   Dingell, D-Mich., asked the SEC to report on whether the bonus
payments ``impaired the capital of the firm or have constituted
fraudulent transfers under the bankruptcy laws.'' The request was
in a Feb. 21 letter to the SEC made public on Friday.
   Dingell, in his capacity as chairman of the oversight and
investigations subcommittee, asked the SEC to ``provide the
subcommittee with the commission's analysis of these payments in
relation to violations of both the letter and spirit of the
applicable provisions of the federal securities laws.''
   The subcommittee also asked the SEC to deliver by March 16 ``a
copy of Drexel's bankruptcy contingency plan, and copies of any
minutes, transcripts or other memorializations of any board of
directors meetings where any such plan was discussed or approved.''

<HEAD>Bolar Announces Resignations, Warns of Possible Criminal Liability</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Bolar Pharmaceutical Co., the beleaguered
generic drug manufacturer that is undergoing a Food and Drug
Administration audit and facing fraud charges brought by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, said Thursday its president and
executive vice president had resigned.
   The company also said it might face criminal charges as a result
of the FDA investigation, which involves the application and
manufacturing processes for the firm's drugs.
   Bolar said in a statement it currently is not selling products
that account for nearly all of its sales, and warned that earnings
are likely to suffer as a result.
   Bolar said its president, Robert Shulman, was replaced by the
company's chief financial officer, Larry Raisfeld. Jack Rivers, the
firm's executive vice president, also stepped down, but both he and
Shulman were remaining on Bolar's board.
   The firm also said its director of scientific affairs, Seymour
Inkles, was named acting head of research and development.
   The SEC filed civil fraud charges against Bolar in federal court
in Washington earlier this month, accusing the company of making
misleading and inadequate disclosure to the public about its
agreement with the FDA to temporarily suspend shipment of some of
its drugs.
   Bolar halted distribution pending the FDA audit of its
application and manufacturing procedures. The company also withdrew
its version of the high-blood-pressure drug Dyazide recently
because it appeared false documents had been used to support its
claims for the product.
   The company said Thursday it has resumed shipping some of its
drug lines, but many remain under audit, and some are being
recalled for the purposes of an audit.
   ``The FDA has not indicated that these products are unsafe or
ineffective and the company intends to reintroduce some or all'' of
the recalled drugs after its own review and approval by the FDA,
Bolar said.
   Bolar said the drugs being recalled were in addition to earlier
recalls of its versions of Dyazide and two other widely-used drugs,
Macrodantin and Dilantin. There have been no recalls or questions
raised by the FDA about those drugs, which are manufactured by
other companies.
   The firm said it did not know how long of the government audits
might take, and ``there can be no assurance that FDA approvals will
be forthcoming.''
   Bolar said it was not selling products that accounted for 94
percent of its 1989 sales. ``Such cessation of sales ... will have
a material adverse effect on the company's financial position,'' it
said.
   Bolar said it believed some of the FDA audits might ``give rise
to criminal liability, including possible criminal liability with
respect to the company.'' It did not elaborate.
   The SEC action, the second against Bolar in as many months, also
named Shulman, the now-departed president. In January, the SEC
suspended trading in Bolar's securities for 10 days after
allegations that the company falsified safety claims about its
high-blood-pressure drug.
   That suspension came after a House subcommittee disclosed a
letter from Bolar's attorneys that indicated the company apparently
falsified documents about safety tests for Dyazide.

<TEXT>
   Poland signed World Bank loan agreements
for $360 million Thursday, delivered with the promise that up to
$2.5 billion will be available if Poland sticks to its dramatic
economic reform plan.
   World Bank President Barber Conable also pledged that the total
of $5 billion his agency plans to lend in Eastern Europe in the
next three years won't come at the expense of aid to impoverished
nations elsewhere which have traditionally borrowed from the
international development bank.
   ``We are expanding our role in Eastern Europe precisely because
of our worldwide responsibilities and experience _ and because
Eastern Europe's agenda of change, growth and expanded human
opportunity make a compelling claim on our resources,'' Conable
told government officials.
   But he said ``assistance to Eastern Europe should be additional
so as not to come at the expense of the poorer parts of the Third
World.''
   U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, chosen by
President Bush to coordinate aid to Poland, was in Warsaw Thursday
for a two-day working visit with Polish officials mapping the
nation's economic reform efforts.
   He met with Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Finance Minister
Leszek Balcerowicz and other economic leaders.
   Conable said no Eastern European country is poor enough to
qualify for the World Bank loans provided by its International
Development Agency, and that the World Bank's strong capital
position and access to funds will allow it to expand other lending
without crowding out other regions.
   The entry of the newly democratic nations of the East bloc and
their shattered economies into the competition for aid has left
nations in Africa, Latin America and elsewhere worried that
resources will dry up.
   Even in Poland there has been concern in some quarters that the
other East bloc countries following Warsaw's course toward reform,
some of which have less-damaged industrial bases, will draw away
needed Western assistance.
   Poland withdrew from the Washington-based World Bank in 1954 and
returned in 1986. The other East bloc members are Hungary and
Romania. Czechoslovakia, which also withdrew in 1954, applied in
January to rejoin the bank, owned by the governments of 152
countries.
   The loan agreements signed by Conable, Balcerowicz and Polish
National Bank President Wladyslaw Baka, with Mazowiecki looking on,
are the first for Poland since it rejoined the World Bank.
   A $260 million loan will support industrial export, while the
second $100 million loan will finance agricultural development.
Both 17-year loans are intended for enterprises that will ``break
bottlenecks'' impeding production in Poland's outmoded industries
and under-mechanized farming, said Janel Loos, the World Bank's
expert on Poland.
   The loans will go to the Polish National Bank, which will extend
credit to commercial banks for lending to industries that meet the
World Bank's criteria for viability and repayment potential.
   The World Bank expects to lend up to $2.5 billion to Poland in
the next three years, and Baka said Poland expects to receive about
$1 billion in the next year.
   But the National Bank president said Poland's infrastructure is
not yet sufficient to handle additional lending, and that the
expansion of commercial banking and other changes are required.
   The World Bank will extend further credit as long as Poland
continues its unprecedented effort to convert its staggering
centrally controlled economy into a market-driven system, Conable
said.
   ``The international community can, and will, be of assistance
but ultimately, the peoples and their governments must shoulder the
burden of economic modernization,'' he told Polish officials.
   ``Choice already exists in the political sphere and it must be
dramatically extended in the economic sector,'' Conable said.
   Among the required steps, he listed an overhaul of the monopoly
state enterprise system, an opening of the Polish economy to the
West, creation of a capital market, and revisions of business
regulations and labor laws.
   He said protection must be provided for those displaced by the
economic reform, expected to create substantial unemployment as
unprofitable state enterprises close.
   The ``alarming decline'' in health standards in Eastern Europe
must be halted, education modernized and the housing shortage
abated, he said.
   And, he said, because Eastern Europe includes some of the
world's most polluted regions, ``action on the environmental front
cannot be postponed until some future date with the economic crisis
has been overcome.''
   To advise on these efforts, Conable said, the World Bank will
within three months establish a mission in Warsaw with a high-level
director, one of only three such offices worldwide.
   Conable and Baka said further funding also depends on
far-reaching restructuring or reduction of Poland's $40 billion
debt to the West.
   The ``first encouraging step'' was taken last week, Conable
said, when the Paris Club, an informal grouping of 17 countries
holding $27 billion of the debt agreed to a one-year moratorium on
payments and a 14-year restructuring covering $10 billion.

<HEAD>Media General Reports $20.7 Million Net Income For 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Media General Inc. reported a sharply narrower
fourth quarter loss and said earnings more than doubled in 1989,
largely reflecting the impact of a major writeoff in 1988.
   The company reported a loss of $1.2 million, or 4 cents a share,
in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $29.6
million, or $1.03 a share, in the same period a year earlier.
Revenues fell to $165 million from $191 million.
   For the full year, net income rose to $20.7 million, or 80 cents
a share, from $8.8 million, or 31 cents a share, in 1988. Revenues
fell 19.8 percent to $606 million from $756 million.
   The company's results for the year and the fourth quarter of
1988 were depressed by a $41.5 million writeoff largely stemming
from the sale of its broadcast services operation.
   The latest quarter's results included a $9.9 million gain from
the sale of a newspaper by Garden State Newspapers, of which Media
General owns 40 percent.
   That gain was largely offset by a $6.5 million loss representing
unrecovered costs and expenses relating to the company's lawsuit
against William B. Tanner, former head of Tanner Co., and other
former Tanner executives.
   Earlier this month, Richmond-based Media General settled a
lawsuit stemming from its acquisition of Tanner, a broadcasting
company later investigated for federal tax and mail fraud
violations. Media General sued Tanner executives in 1984 after the
federal charges were filed.
   Tanner pleaded guilty in 1985 to three tax charges and one mail
fraud charge, the company said.
   Fourth-quarter 1989 earnings also were reduced by $9.5 million
in charges to cover the writeoff of discontinued printing equipment
as well as revisions to the estimated tax rate and certain
liabilities and reserves for the year.
   Media General publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch and The
Richmond News Leader, as well as other newspapers.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said Friday it paid
1989 bonuses of $196 million in cash and $64 million in company
stock, less than reports that pointed to large payments prior to
the firm's collapse.
   Drexel released details about the payments after harsh reaction
from bankruptcy court creditors who criticized the firm for
reportedly paying up to $350 million in bonuses shortly before its
parent filed for Chapter 11 protection.
   Drexel said 44 percent, or $113 million, of the total bonuses
was guaranteed to executives and top professionals early in 1989 in
an effort to keep them at the firm after it agreed to plead guilty
to securities crimes and pay $650 million in penalties.
   With the firm's demise, the value of bonuses taken in stock in
Drexel's parent became potentially worthless.
   ``What it says is these bonuses were part of the ongoing
business activities,'' Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said.
``There was nothing extraordinary and in fact they were prudently
pared back in light of the changed business conditions.''
   But William Schopf, general counsel for First City Bancorp. of
Texas, one of the largest creditors, said the disclosure does not
resolve questions about Drexel's financial state at the time of the
payments and why the firm made guarantees despite its uncertain
condition.
   ``It's still a lot of money to go out the door,'' Schopf said.
   Drexel said the bonuses, of which $150 million were paid in
December and $110 million in January, were 60 percent below the
amount paid in the same two months a year earlier, when Drexel said
it paid $505 million.
   The disclosure came as questions about Drexel's demise grew and
anger over the bonuses intensified. Two congressional panels
scheduled inquiries into the collapse and creditors asked a
bankruptcy court judge to appoint an examiner to oversee the
company's management.
   In papers filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, a leading creditor
accused the parent company and its brokerage subsidiary of
dissipating billions of dollars in assets without prior knowledge
or court supervision.
   Drexel said its 22 senior management members received $14.2
million in bonuses, including $7.5 million that had been guaranteed
earlier. Of the remainder, executives invested ``a sizable share''
in preferred stock. Chief executive Frederick Joseph reportedly
took his entire bonus in stock.
   Anreder said the guarantees were made because of the firm's
uncertain status after it agreed to enter the guilty plea, which
followed a lengthy government investigation.
   ``In order to show a sense of comfort that their compensation
would be on a par or close to what they had received previously,
the guarantees were necessary,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, former employees met about attempting to recover the
value of their stock holdings in the collapsed firm. The workers'
54 percent ownership of the parent was wiped out by the bankruptcy
filing.
   ``Most of us have written it down to zero,'' said Geoffrey
Snyder, who was promoted to corporate vice president a few weeks
before Drexel's demise. ``A lot of us didn't have a say in what
went on in terms of the reasons it's gone down to zero. We want to
see if we have any rights.''
   Snyder said shareholders planned to form a committee to join a
general meeting of creditors set for next Tuesday in Manhattan.
Many employees had most or all of their wealth locked in Drexel
shares. Shareholders generally are last to receive payments in a
bankruptcy case, behind other creditors.
   Drexel's parent company filed for Chapter 11 protection from
creditors on Feb. 13.
   The motion seeking an examiner was filed by First City, which is
owed $25 million and has emerged as the most active creditor. The
matter will be considered at a hearing next Thursday before U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Howard Buschman III.
   First City said it wants more information about the liquidation
of billions of dollars in assets by the brokerage subsidiary,
including Drexel's payment of as much as $350 million in bonuses in
the weeks before its collapse. Some executives reportedly received
up to $20 million.
   An examiner ``can zero in directly on the two questions we're
interested in right now: the massive and rapid disposal of assets
that seems to be going on and the bonus payments,'' said James E.
Day, a First City senior vice president.
   In court papers, First City said it has been unable to obtain
information about Drexel's assets and operations despite a meeting
with a Drexel employee on Thursday.
   The creditor also said an order by Buschman granting Drexel a
90-day extension to file financial data disclosure, which First
City has challenged, also has slowed the process.
   Under federal bankruptcy law, a judge can order a debtor to
return assets sold before a bankruptcy filing if the judge finds
that creditors were defrauded. Asset transfers to another creditor,
such as a corporate insider, also may qualify for an order.
   But creditors may have trouble recovering assets already sold
because the brokerage subsidiary has not filed for bankruptcy
protection. Drexel earlier this week said it had sold nearly $38
billion in securities holdings and was liquidating remaining assets.

   Shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange took another
nosedive Friday, with computerized program selling sending the main
market index falling more than 900 points to a four-month low.
   The dollar rose against the yen, meanwhile, as the Japanese
currency reflected the weakness in stocks. The dollar closed at
146.47 yen, up 1.24 yen from Thursday's close.
   The 225-issue Nikkei average fell 935.87 points _ or about 2{
percent _ to 34,890.97. It was the first time the Nikkei index had
fallen below the 35,000 mark since Oct. 17, when it closed at
34,996.08.
   The market's leading indicator, which on Wednesday lost 1,161.19
points in the third biggest one-day decline ever, had finished
Friday morning's session down 718.01 points, or 2.0 percent.
   Share prices showed signs of recovery at the start of afternoon
trading, encouraged by some buying orders from investors taking
advantage of the downswing, but a wave of program selling by
arbitragers soon depressed the Nikkei.
   Dealers attributed the Nikkei's recent decline mainly to
speculation of an increase in the Bank of Japan's discount rate,
the key rate the central bank charges on loans to commercial banks.
Higher interest rates tend to discourage stock investment.
   The discount rate stands at 4.25 percent following three
increases in the last year. Central bank officials have said only
that they are watching economic conditions, but a rise in inflation
in recent months along with fast growth in the economy and the
money supply have led many analysts to predict a further increase.
   Widespread bearish sentiment caused by the recent volatility of
the exchange also contributed to Friday's decline, dealers said.
   So far this week, the Nikkei index has dropped 1,645.15 points,
or 4.4 percent, not counting Friday morning's losses. On Thursday,
the index swung more than 800 points during the day before ending
with a modest gain.
   Computer-aided arbitrage selling amid the extremely thin trading
was another factor in Friday's drop, dealers said.
   As a result of the falling stock futures index, institutional
investors _ primarily foreign trust funds _ sold a large volume of
shares on the stock market.
   ``The market is extremely vulnerable right now to such selling,
because of the low volume of stocks being traded and small number
of investors taking part,'' said Michio Katsumata of Nomura
Securities Co.
   ``Most major players remain on the sidelines because of
uncertain prospect of the market's directions.''
   He said securities and trust fund companies hesitate to increase
their holdings for fear of reporting losses at the end of the
fiscal year, which ends March 31.
   Most Japanese companies close their annual accounts at the end
of March and securities companies often cash in some of their
holdings at the end of the fiscal year to offset earlier losses.
   Speculation about the emergence of another stock scandal also
discouraged many investors from entering the already-bearish
market, dealers said. One rumor suggested a major ruling-party
politician may be arrested for illegal stock dealings. There was no
news to back up the rumors.
   ``I don't know how serious the rumors are this time, but they
surely make investors think twice about buying new stocks,'' said a
dealer with Tachibana Securities Co., speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   In Tokyo's foreign exchange market, the dollar started trading
at 146.20 yen, up a sharp 0.97 yen from Thursday's close. It moved
in a range of 145.95-146.32 yen in moderate trading.
   The U.S. currency opened higher following its overnight surge
against the yen, which also lost ground against other major
currencies including the West German mark, said Toru Kanai, a
foreign exchange analyst with New Japan Securities Co.
   In New York the dollar closed at 146.53 yen, up from 145.50 yen
on Wednesday.
   ``Currently, market players are not sure which direction the
dollar may go,'' Kanai said. ``About half of traders say the dollar
will go lower, and others predict it will rise further.''
   Dealers said market participants are frustrated with the Bank of
Japan's failure to raise interest rates. As a result, the yen is
likely to remain weak, they predicted.
   Traders said the central bank was selling dollars intermittently
throughout the morning in an attempt to buck up the yen. The bank
does not comment on its monetary actions.

   Perrier, the spring water giant already
reeling from a worldwide recall, is being sued by a number of angry
consumers who claim the company knowingly sold water tainted with
the toxic chemical benzene.
   Several lawsuits filed in the last week in U.S. District Courts
in Bridgeport and Philadelphia charge the company with misleading
the public by portraying its water as pure, natural and superior to
other brands.
   ``In fact, Perrier water was not better than the other leading
brands. The opposite was true,'' said a lawsuit filed Tuesday in
federal court in Bridgeport on behalf of B.B. Vahlsing, a longtime
Perrier drinker from Wynnewood, Pa.
   Richard Bieder, whose law firm of Koskoff, Koskoff &amp; Bieder is
representing Vahlsing, said Friday that his client has ``purchased
Perrier for a substantial period of time, relying on the fact she
thought it was pure, as anybody who watches their ads would think,
when they stick that straw into the mountain and suck water out.''
   The suit was filed in Connecticut because Perrier Group of
America Inc. is based in Greenwich, Bieder said.
   At least six other lawsuits were filed Feb. 16 in Philadelphia,
because the plaintiffs live in Pennsylvania and Perrier was sold
there, said C. Oliver Burt III of Greenfield &amp; Chimicles, a
Haverford, Pa., law firm that represents some plaintiffs.
   The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages for anguish they
say they suffered when they found out that the water bottled in
Vergeze, France, was tainted with tiny amounts of benzene, a toxic
chemical and industrial solvent.
   The lawsuits name as defendants Source Perrier SA, Perrier Group
and Perrier Group of America.
   All the lawsuits ask the courts to declare a class action, which
would allow Perrier drinkers across the country to join.
   Perrier spokeswoman Jane Lazgin said attorneys hired by her
company had not yet read the complaints in detail and had no
comment.
   ``But it does seem groundless to us,'' she said. ``We feel we've
taken the necessary measures and have acted rightly.''
   Perrier recalled 72 million bottles in North America on Feb. 9
after a few bottles in North Carolina were found to contain traces
of benzene, a substance linked to cancer in animals when fed in
high doses.
   The company initially said the problem was caused by a worker
who inadvertently contaminated a bottling machine by cleaning it
with benzene.
   But the recall was expanded to 160 million bottles around the
world the next week after more contamination was discovered
overseas. Perrier acknowledged benzene is found naturally in its
spring in France and contamination occurred because workers failed
to replace filters designed to remove the benzene.
   Lazgin said she could not comment on whether Perrier knew about
the benzene in the spring before the recall. The chemical is made
from petroleum but also occurs naturally in drinking water and
groundwater at low concentrations.
   Perrier sparkling water was the third best-selling bottled water
in the United States in 1988, capturing about 5.7 percent of the
$2.2 billion in industrywide sales for the year, according to
Beverage Marketing Corp., an industry research consultant.
   The suits filed in Connecticut and Pennsylvania are the only
known legal actions by Perrier drinkers, said Andrew J. Ogilvie, a
San Francisco attorney who specializes in consumer fraud cases and
is also involved in the suits.
   The lawsuits allege Perrier violated consumer protection laws in
several states and committed fraud and misrepresentation through
improper advertising, Bieder and Burt said.

<HEAD>Memo: $11 Million Profit in 1989, $1.2 Billion in Bridge Loan
Exposure</HEAD>

   First Boston Corp., the Wall Street firm
buffeted by rumors of impending layoffs and financial problems,
made only $11 million in 1989 and has about $1.2 billion in exposed
bridge loans, according to an internal memo obtained Friday.
   The memo to employees maintained that First Boston is healthy
and said that large additions to the firm's reserves to protect
against the loans were responsible for the low profit last year.
   The memo from parent company president and chief executive John
M. Hennessey and chairman Rainer E. Gut, distributed after a
regularly scheduled board meeting, sought to distance First Boston
from the recent collapse of another Wall Street giant of the 1980s,
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   ``The board shares your frustration with the current spate of
unfounded rumors and wants to reassure each of you that this firm
is in sound financial condition, is well funded and has sufficient
back-up credit resources to weather any short-term disruptions
caused by fallout from the Drexel bankruptcy,'' the memo said.
   Drexel's parent sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection
from creditors Feb. 13 after it defaulted on short-term loans after
its bank credit dried up, in part because of large holdings in the
souring junk bond market.
   The First Boston memo reported the firm had a portfolio of $107
million in high-yield bonds at current market value, including $30
million in bonds of two Campeau Corp. subsidiaries that have filed
for bankruptcy protection.
   The bridge loans by CS First Boston Inc., parent of the
investment firm, total $257 million to Campeau and $953 million to
Ohio Mattress Co., Jerrico Inc. and American Medical International,
said the memo, which was obtained from a source inside the company.
   A bridge loan is temporary financing used until permanent
financing is in place.
   The firm has nearly $2 billion in capital, including more than
$1.1 billion in equity and ``sufficient reserves to cover any
further exposures from our merchant banking portfolio,'' Hennessey
and Gut said. They also said the firm's credit ratings have been
reaffirmed in the last month.
   First Boston was the subject of intensified market rumors Friday
that began several weeks ago, when speculation rose that it planned
to lay off hundreds of employees and had missed a credit payment to
London-based sister company Financiere Credit Suisse-First Boston.
   Spokesman Fred Garcia denied both rumors.
   The privately held firm recently said it was phasing out its
fixed-income futures brokerage business in Chicago and laying off
29 employees and said the reductions were part of a six-month
``rolling review'' of businesses that would continue.
   The memo said the firm's 1990 budget ``anticipates a disciplined
look at our cost structure to ensure that we are as lean as
possible.''
   First Boston merged with Credit-Suisse last year in a $1.1
billion deal. The combined entity, CS First Boston, is 45 percent
owned by Credit Suisse.

   Penny-stock mogul Meyer Blinder and four
associates were indicted Friday in Las Vegas on federal
racketeering and securities fraud charges.
   The 11-count indictment seeks $9.5 million to be forfeited to
the government by the five defendants if they are convicted.
Blinder founded Blinder, Robinson &amp; Co., which once was the
nation's largest penny stock brokerage.
   Also indicted were Stuart Cohen, the company's national sales
director; Anthony Beshara, its head trader; and Ronald Wheeler Jr.
and Ronald Wheeler Sr., who operated a retail securities brokerage,
Stoneridge Securities, in Las Vegas, said U.S. Attorney General
Mike Norton in Denver.
   All five face charges of racketeering conspiracy, racketeering
and securities fraud. Blinder, Cohen and Beshara face charges of
unlawful distribution of securities, and the Wheelers face wire
fraud charges.
   Within the racketeering conspiracy charges are several
``predicate crimes,'' authorities said, including securities fraud,
money laundering and wire fraud.
   In a statement, Blinder Robinson called the charges against
Blinder ``baseless.'' It said the company ``can and will carry on
its business affairs as always in accordance with the highest
standards of fair play and fair dealing.''
   The five defendants will not be arrested, but have been summoned
to appear for arraignment in Las Vegas on March 9, said Special
Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Dion in Las Vegas. A trial date had not
been set.
   The charges involve about $9.5 million in sales of three stocks,
Onnix Financial Group Inc., Executive Capital Inc. and SBB Inc.
   The indictment alleges Michael Wright and Arnold Kimmes formed
sham public corporations, gained control of the stocks and
conspired with Blinder Robinson to resell the stocks to the public
as if they were publicly registered from late 1984 until about May
1988.
   ``Two people really controlled all the stock when it looked like
it was publicly controlled by a bunch of investors,'' Dion said. He
said Stoneridge was ``used as a conduit to give stocks to Blinder.''
   Kimmes pleaded guilty to racketeering charges last March and is
scheduled for sentencing March 8, Dion said. He would not comment
on Wright.
   The investigation began in 1987 and was led by the Internal
Revenue Service, with help from the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the Justice Department.
   A raid at Blinder Robinson's Englewood headquarters in November
1988, in which federal agents seized more than a million documents,
was part of the investigation, Dion said.
   Blinder Robinson spokesman and attorney David Aufhauser did not
immediately answer phone calls to his Washington, D.C., office
Friday.
   Since the 1988 raid, Blinder Robinson has posted losses,
including a $10 million loss for 1988 and a $1.5 million loss for
the first three quarters of 1989.
   Last fall, it had about 44 sales offices nationwide, down from
82 in 1988, and its brokers had dropped to 600 or fewer from a 1988
high of about 1,800.
   Penny stocks are cheap securities, sometimes selling for just
cents, that are traded over the counter rather than on a stock
exchange.
